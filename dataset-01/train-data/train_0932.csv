2,They already did this without anyones help,"poor, poor pm5k.........their never gonna get it right.........with each new release, they seem to knock off another better band..........with this release, they try to be the misfits, and it doesnt work.........the only good osngs on this entire album are ""wild world"", and ""murder"" save your cash...download these two tracks and forget the rest"
1,I saw it at the c.d. store and laughed at it...,"Boy this is the all time worst Powerman 5000 c.d. ever. period. I dealt with Transform when it came out as it was a lot different then tonight the stars revolt. Transform did have some heavier songs on it but was a bit more toward the punk rock side of things, nevertheless it wasn't an all out bad c.d. it was just a bit different. So unless you've gone soft like PM5K have and are not into the heavy music anymore you won't mind this c.d. at all. I don't know why they're even putting the name Powerman 5000 to disgrace when it's only one remaining member left. I hope Spider decides to call it quits when he sees how few copies of the c.d. move off the shelves. That's it I'm done with this review and Powerman 5000, although Tonight the stars revolt! will remain high up in my personal favorites collection."
1,What is this?,"Wow, it's rare I actually toss an album in the garbage. It's that bad. I'll be the first to admit that Powerman 5K was never the best out there but I still love their 'Stars Revolt' album, it had character, it had inspiration, it wass enjoyable to listen to. I didn't hear the last album, but this one, beyond bland. They sound worse than most high school blands....I mean bands <---actual typo. I don't know what else to say, I typically don't write reviews on here but seriously, I just had to get this off my chest. I seriously threw this album away!"
3,Light up feesbie,the product is great when it works. i've only had it for a month and it is already broken. this product is meant for fields and beaches only: places with nothing for the frisbee to collide with. my frisbee has collided with my backyard fench 4-5 times since i've had it. it no longer lights up. it is incredibly fun but not durable at all.
2,Breaks waaaay to easily,The frisbee broke within the first couple weeks of using it. It hit the ground with a force normal to throwing a frisbee and now the lights dont turn on.
3,Leather Tackles the Flesh Trade,"Jack Solomon is working in the Balkans, helping forensically identify the victims of the many brutal massacres from the civil war in Yugoslavia. With the chance finding of a possible eyewitness, he hopes to be able to bring at least one or maybe some of the perpetrators to justice. The trail leads to London and the murky worlds of prostitution and people trafficking. Leather writes gritty, violent and visceral thrillers. He seems to have a great deal of interest in `Ladies of the Night' but maybe it's just local colour? I've read a few of his and this is mid-range - a little bit predictable. Good quick read for fans but not great. Three or four stars? Upper three, heading for four."
5,Gotta hand it to Leahter he is great,"The story starts off with Jack Solomon working for a non profit aid agency that uses DNA to help identify the victims that were killed and dumped in mass graves. The story thickens when he is called in to identify 26 bodies which were put into a fridge vehicle, which preserves the bodies and makes it harder for Jack to put this case behind him. He tries to track down an ""Eyewitness"" Hence the name. This takes him to the red light industries of Sarajevo and London as this person is a prostitute. The ending is good and for those people who like a bit of lets say romance there is a bit of that to.Great readGreat read"
2,Only for reference,"I bought this book to learn MRI, but the work is more of an encylopedia than a readable textbook. It contains too much useless information, while the important material is not particularly well written, presented, or organized; for example, the first 300 pages of physics is too often impenetrable and consistently overly theoretical, esp. the parts written by PhD's as opposed to MD's. The chapters are inconsistent in quality, varying from poor to very good. Although the book was supposedly printed in 1999, most of the references are 7-8 years old, the most recent being around 1995; this book is hardly state-of-the-art in its field. It is hard to believe that a book this expensive and in its 3rd edition could have so many typographical errors; did anyone proofread this book? The print is very small, the smallest I've ever seen in a top-of-the-line radiology reference work. On the plus side, it is well illustrated and an outline precedes each chapter."
2,Every project is almost the same,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Every single project is almost the same except for design and color. The projects are pretty, but for the cost of the book, it's really not worth it. Don't waste your money. Wait to find it at a yard sale for 50 cents."
5,One Of Tha Greatest Albums Put Out,"Hollow Tip's first album, Takin No Shortz is his best album. His follow up, Flawless, wasn't that good, but it was better than what was to come in tha future for him. Tha beats on here are incredible, whether it's a smooth one, or a gangsta beat you can bob your head to. Hollow Tip has one of tha greatest flow's I've ever heard in my life on this album. His flow is so smooth, and it's one of tha fastest I've ever heard. Hollow Tip is also an incredible lyricist. Off The Dome Freestyle is one of tha tightest songs I've ever heard in my life. You have to have this album, or you are missing out on a masterpiece.1. No More Brains - 5/52. Steady Flossin - 4.5/53. My World - 5/5 / Featuring Ballin Ass Dame4. Ridin - 5/55. Everybody Knows - 3.5/5 / Featuring Ballin Ass Dame & J-Mack6. Off The Dome Freestyle - 5/5 / Featuring Lil Devious Locc7. Hoo Ride Attack - 4/5 / Featuring J-Mack8. Takin No Shortz - 5/59. Warlocc - 4.5/510. Outro - 4/5"
5,Hollow Tip is as good as they come,Hollow Tip is the best fast rapper I've ever heard. His lyrics and style are totally unique and flow unlike any other rapper I've heard. Takin' No Shortz has a lot of sicc and timeless tracks which makes it a klassic. I'm afraid he may have sold out on Flawless though. Time will tell. If you think that takin' no shortz was good and you know of another album that can compare to it let me know cuz the're hard to filter out of all the crap out there
5,Solid cleaning system,"I have now used this about six times, and it has done the job admirably. The little brush is just not quite useful enough, but it gets the job done (only downer in the system). Other than that, great product, will definitely buy again."
4,Great kit,"Was looking for something to clean my electronic screens without damaging them and I got lucky with this kit. Cleans great and leaves no residue, no streaking, no scratching, etc. Recommend this kit to anyone with LED televisions. Worked great on my laptop and desktop computer screens too."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Works great!!! Cleans and polishes perfectly. I was astonished how easy it was and how well it worked. It would be nice to have a slightly larger micro-fiber cloth though....
5,Album Stashed Way Back In My Collection,"I have to say of all the hard rock/glam albums I own this one still holds up like it was made yesterday. I was listening to it last night and was glad I owned this album. All of the songs are great melodic, catchy tunes and I think the songs could stand up today against anything out there. A very ahead of its time album. Do yourself a favor and find this gem, used or in a pawn shop it doesn't matter you will be greatly satisfied with Neverland ""Neverland""."
4,Under-rated Album,"I purchased this album in cassette format in 1996. I have to admit the Spirit of Love album has to be Majek Fashek's best work. A few of my favorite tracks from this album are ""I'm not Tired"", ""I come from the Ghetto"" and ""Send down the rain"". Also, Majek Beware"" stands out on this album. If you are a Reggae music fan or a World Music fan get this one in any format available."
3,A lovely and colorful Celtic art resource,"This is basically a ""picture book"" of examples of Celtic-style knotwork and images, each rendered in luscious four-color plates.I find it most useful as a companion to the various Dover Publishing Celtic art books (including stencils, needlework, drawing guides, etc) as a visual reference on ""how"" to color in the black-and-white examples found in those works.Otherwise, it's a beautiful book on its own!"
1,Under-cooked Book,"I bought this book expecting the definitive guide to sausages. Not. This is a survey of sausages the world around - what they are made of, casings and who makes them. I confess I didn't need to hear about the guy in Thailand making sausages on his little farm.Also included is a host of sausage food recipes which I just scanned. They looked light weight (like the rest of the book) and nothing caught my eye.What's not in this book? Any useful information on making or cooking sausages. ""Spice to taste"". Never a useful hint on the typical ratio of spices for various sausages. What good is a sausage recipe without at least guidance on spicing?This book is only useful for answering questions like ""What's in blood sausage?"" and nothing in the way of ""how do you ...."".Basically it's not a cookbook - it's a coffee table book without pictures."
2,The not-so-great sausage book,"It's presumptuous for this book to call itself the ""only complete guide"" to sausage. True, it has encyclopedic descriptions of every ethnic sausage known to man, BUT doesn't give all the recipes. I also found the book to be slanted towards the British Isles in content and terminology. And the last straw, it contains no American sources for sausage-making supplies. Had I viewed it in a bookstore, I would never have purchased it. Rytek Kutas' book is the best!"
1,Sad Sausage Book,Having made sausage for years and researching new formulas and reciepies constantly This was by far the biggest waste of my time and money that I have ever ordered for myself.This isnt the great book of anything.
4,sausages,This was a good starter book on sausages. It covered the basics well for a new sausage maker.
2,Hmmm...,"Doesn't work well as a DVD, would work better as a close your eyes CD. I'm just not quite sure what to think about this one! I'm a feminist but not so much into my ""womb"" as this woman is. It's an interesting DVD, I guess, and maybe beneficial to some, but I won't be watching it again soon. There are so many other tapes out there, I'd really chose another. To describe the DVD, it's a woman sitting in a chair, for the entire DVD, wildly vibrating her hands in circular motions (Mudras) following guided meditations. You really can't follow/learn the hand motions and meditate at the same time either, it's really a bit odd, cheaply done, and not really beneficial for any cetain purpose."
2,3 'Crtl' keys!,"YES! I am now a proud own of a brand new Mac keyboard with 3 'Crtl' keys. Two of the 'Crtl' keys are right next to each other... how thoughtful of Kensington. I can't tell you how many times my finger has slipped off of the useless 'shift' key and accidentally hit the omnipresent 'Crtl' key.Let me count the number of times I've needed the 'Crtl' key on my Mac... hmm, grand total: 0 (zero). I'm anxiously looking forward to that day I'll need it though.Also, I'd like to congratulate the little elves who rubber stamped the faded key lettering for getting them so straight! I would have never be able to get them in the same position every time. I'd just recommended re-inking the pad after a few stamps."
4,The 25th Day of December,"I love and miss Bobby Darin, and Christmas is my favorite time of year. it was wonderful to hear him sing not only old standards, but songs I had not heard in a long time. Merry Christmas!"
4,An Unusual Christmas CD,"Some folks may have a problem with the mixture of songs on this disc. I personally don't. Darin's handling of some of the more serious holiday standards is with complete reverence. His rendition of Silent Night has some very moving vocals and I'm not what one would consider a religious person. Right along side of the standards are obscure spirituals. Jehovah Hallelujah and Child of God are two of which. They're great fun to sing along with and imagine yourself as part of the choir. This is a Christmas album that you just don't see everywhere and that's really a shame because it's so darn good. Mr. Darin's Chrismas Auld Lang Syne is of a classic caliber and really should be playing over those store PAs right along with Bing Crosby's White Christmas and Elvis Presley's Blue Christmas. And if I had my druthers, it would be."
4,These are great,"We love the versatility of these shower heads- they are much easier to slide across the shower pole. The only issue seems to be rust on the actual bar, not the rollers, i dont know if anyone else had this problem?"
3,This Version Not As Good As The One With Jacobi/Guinness!,"There are two versions of Little Dorrit: One by Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness et al and the other by Claire Foy & Mathew Macfadyen. If both versions are compared side by side, most viewer will prefer the earlier Jacobi/Guinness version. I only have it on Laser Discs and I hope they will come out with a DVD version of it soon."
4,"Little Dorrit, lots of viewing pleasure","Another excellent BBC production. Although a lesser known story of Dickens it was thoroughly enjoyable. The characters are as varied and colorful as you possibly can imagine and the cast brings them to life. You want to root for the 'good guys' and love to hate the bad ones. The going back and forth between the poor dark alleys of life in those days with the very colorful rich upper-class' life prevents this story from becoming too depressing. If you like period pieces, this is a must see"
1,pale reflection of the Sands Films production,"ugh! Gutted the story, bad acting, lousy sets.....to quote The Critic, 'it stinks'. Get the Sands Films double film version with Alec Guinness and Derek Jacobi. Infinitely better made and better acted."
4,Wonderful Production,I have been watching Little Dorrit on PBS and am thoroughly enjoying it...Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy are perfectly cast. Was it just me or was any one else moved when Amy Dorrit tells Maggy the story of the princess and the little woman in the cottage who keeps watch over a beloved shadow (as a metaphor for her secret love for Arthur Clennam?) This is a beautifully moving scene...her watching Arthur from the window while she tells Maggy the story. I can't wait to read this book!
3,Ish,Some things I liked about this and some I didn't. I resent that they put a lesbian part in there that I didn't feel was even implied in the book.
5,Great show!,That pretty much says it. Great show! Now if only I could come up with thirteen more words somehow. Hmmm...
5,"Quality Television, I wish there were more of these.","Little Dorrit is quality television, I really enjoyed it. Seemingly 7 hours, very well acted and very well told. The 30 minute episode format was a bit distracting but I am sure it was designed for television in these small 30 min blocks.Price is a bit steep above $30 but well worth it for 7 hours of entertainment for two.We need more period pieces that are not all Jane Austin!"
5,Little Dorrit - - - better than the novel,"This is a great miniseries. This 4-disc, 7.5-hour-long, 14-part miniseries is an adaptation of the novel ""Little Dorrit"" by Victorian-era writer Charles Dickens. The novel was originally published as a ""serial"" between 1855 and 1857. Set in pre-Victorian 1820s London, the story follows the life of the title character, Dorrit, working as a seamstress while her father is locked away in debtor's prison. Claire Foy is brilliant in the title role of Dorrit. If you do not fall in love with her, you have no heart. Revealing any more of the plot (as other Amazon reviewers have done here) would create ""spoilers."" Anyone who enjoys Dickens, or character-driven stories in general, will enjoy this series."
4,Love it!,"I was reading the novel and I bought this to help me along. It mixes up the order of things, but it also helps you understand the plot and the main points a lot more! Absolutely fantastic. If it hadn't cut out some important parts, then I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Little Dorrit,I loved Little Dorrit. It kept me in suspense until the end. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because there were a few pauses in the last episode. I don't know if they were scratches or what.
3,good leads overcome overheated adaptation of Dickens,"The umpteenth adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel by the BBC with a clever angle: the 14 episodes begin and end with one hour parts but the middle 12 are half hour installments with the feverish twists and cliff-hangar endings akin to reading Dickens in a serialized format the way they were originally enjoyed. Like so many recent UK productions of Dickens (especially Bleak House), they seem frightened of just presenting Dickens and feel the need to jazz things up with quick cuts and dramatic camera movements. It's not too feverish and the two leads (Matthew MacFadyen and Claire Foy) are strong quiet presences around which scenery chewing supporting actors like Andy Serkis and Judy Parfitt act up a storm. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
3,Too many annoying ads,"The series is fine, but the BBC makes you watch long, un-fast-forwardable trailers each time you view -- annoying, as we have already paid for this."
5,Little Dorrit,"Dickens Little Dorrit is a wonderful rendition of the book. When you watch it, you'll just want to see what is next. I loved and hated each character for their goodness and down-right evil. Charles Dickens had a well established knowledge of the human charter. I can highly recommend this set of DVDs."
4,great dickens story,"If you enjoy Charles Dickens stories you will like these characters.It appears the British made the best period piece stories. The maincharacters really carry this story especially little Dorrit, ArthurClennan and the dastardly Rigaud. All British bbc productionsdirected by Andrew Davies have been top drawer. Great entertainment."
5,Priceless!,"This series held me spellbound! Such a lovely story, and the scenery and costumes were unbelievable! I highly recommend this movie for any interested in period pieces and a clean, relaxing and beautiful experience in movie classics."
5,Well done in every way,"At this price, it is a wonder, a bargain if there ever was one. Scenery, acting, music, all suit me nicely. I have the book so I could see the novel scene by scene. Of course, the movie is not a line by line creation of the book. This long movie is close enough. Dickens themes are done well. Dickens is such a master of telling a story and creating characters. Every character is done well. The actress playing Amy Dorrit is just right. Camera work is brillant.I had no trouble understanding anyone's spoken words.The special feature about making the film is really good, in my opinion.It's the bees knees."
5,Mesmerizing beauty,"The first time I heard Djam Leelii, I was just mesmerized. I couldn't believe the beauty I was hearing. I quickly bought a copy and listened to it constantly for years. About half the songs are more upbeat and 'traditional,' then half - those mostly with acoustic guitars and occasional (and mellow) electrics - are darker with an understated drive that's quite compelling. And all get into a marvelous easy groove, some with percussion and some without. Baaba Maal's singing is powerful, gorgeous and heartfelt. The title track is just sublime. The three additional songs on this reissue are also excellent; their recording is a bit more direct, not quite as warm, but not far from the originally released tracks. If you love acoustic guitar music of any kind, or West African music, do yourself a wonderful favor by listening to this!"
4,"GREAT, EMOTIONAL, BRILLIANT!!!",This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Simply Superb and brilliant. And the music was great. This is a very powerfull movie.
2,Braun styler ergonomically poor,"I like the old style better for several reasons. Except that it died after only a couple of years of using it exclusively for travel. The new one is larger, taking up more space in my carry on, for no good reason. The lever for opening it up curves upward and is very stiff so it takes a great deal more effort to work the wand. I will use it for traveling to spots outside the US because I don't need a transformer, etc BUT I would never use it at home. Too much trouble. The wand, I think, is also larger around so the curls are not as tight as I would like. I would give it one star but Conair's looks worse with a very short handle. Not a lot of choices in the market. And I am waaay over the age of 13!"
3,Not acceptable for air travel,"I ordered this for my wife because she wanted a cordless curling iron for a sailing vacation. The product description is misleading because it says it is powered by an ""energy cell."" which implied to me that this was some type of electrical battery. Nowhere did it say that this ""energy cell"" was actually a combustible gas cylinder, which is illegal to carry on an airplane, even in checked luggage. It makes this product totally unacceptable for air travel. As a result, we returned the product unopened."
5,Tell Me This Is Not True! $470.95 for This!,"I am in the market for replacing my cordless styler, but I will never pay $470.95 for this product. I called the supplier of this product and they said the price is correct. I like my curls, but the price on this item is absurd!Braun Independent Cordless Styler (C20)"
4,curls great!,"I recently took this curling iron camping and love it! I would definitely buy it again. I'm not sure if the butane cartridges are going to last as long as they say. I used it for 8 days and it seems to be down by half??? It can only fit little sections of hair in at once so it may take a little longer, but it gets really hot and curls your hair instantly."
4,Still not bad,"I'm surprised we didn't hear more of Natural Selection in the early 1990's. I was in high school when the CD came out and was drawn in by the single 'Do Anything'. 'Hearts don't think they feel' was also a single. After high school I studied piano, percussion, and composition in college and after all that, I still think this is a decent attempt at pop music and I've held onto it even though selling most of my other early 90's CD's. There is an obvious Prince influence throughought the album and the hit single had to compete with Prince's 'Cream' from the Diamonds & Pearls album. If 90's music is ever to become a 'genre' like 80's music has, I recommend Natural Selection as one of the most noteworthy, but overlooked, works of the early part of that decade. At the used prices it is worth hearing."
3,Natual Selection,"Not bad... Standout song of course is the hit single featuring Niki Harris (famous for being Madonna's backup singer & releasing 3 of her own albums:see nikiharris.com) but this cd lacks in some areas...with mostly filler music sounding like scraps from Prince, they still pull it off because scraps from Prince is still good music! Neither here nor there."
2,I can't believe it's been that long,"While cleaning out the garage I came across some tapes that my sister had stored there from the 90's. Recognizing most of the names; Vanilla Ice, R.E.M., Wilson Phillips etc. I then came across ""Natural Selection."" ""What's this? I don't remember them."" So I plug in an old RCA dual tape player to start playing side A. Not bad, so I continue to clean.Now in the 90's I was more into birth of alternative music but perhaps for the sake of nostalgia, and an appreciation for the music over played on the radio I kept listening. At the end of the day the garage was almost clean and the tapes were quickly placed on eBay, but the songs remain stuck in my head."
3,I feel like such a traitor...,"Giving a Jonathan record less than four stars feels like a sin since I would be happy if everybody listened to all of his records but Jonathan just doens't seem very focused on this one.There are a few great songs like ""Surrender"", ""Just look at me"" and ""My little girl's got a full time daddy now"" but the others just don't do it for me. He's rehasing old material like he always does but ""Egyptian Raggae"" and ""lesbian bar"" are here in very lackluster versions.""Rock and Roll drummer"" is just Jonathan doing what he does best best which is being dumb but this sounds like forced dumbness (yes I realize that is a ridiculous observation). This is OK, it's just not up to par, I love my life, Jonathan."
3,not fit for every phone,"So because it is hand made thing it is all time different,and this is problem because it is not fit to every cell but cost the money for shipping so I don't thing if it is good thing, that is it.too expensive for this price."
4,Upgrade from my DeWalt,"I upgraded to the Makita Lithium Ion 6 pack when I dropped my DeWalt 14.4 off the roof and it shattered into half a dozen pieces. I chose the Makita brand based on other reviews I had read. The Makita drill fits better in my hands than the DeWalt, it is also lighter and has more power and has a three speed clutch for more versatility.The impact driver is a nice addition to the mix. Great for driving those difficult screws / bolts. Came in handy with some deck repairs. Is even strong enough to take off lug nuts from my truck. (make sure you use impact sockets.)Have used the circular saw only once so far. Flew through 2x4's. Waiting to use the cipro saw. Adding LED's to light what your cutting / drilling is a nice touch.Would have given 5 stars if they offerd the fluorescent light like the LXT402"
3,this set has drawbacks,while i was very happy at first with this set i now am experiencing problems. the first major problem is that the high speed range of the hammer drill went out after only 10 months of use.it not only happened to me but also to a person i work with.for the price that we paid for these tools you would expect them to last at least a couple of years i never had a dewalt or milwaukee go out so fast.problem number 2 is that these lithium ion batteries dont seem to want to work in colder temperatures again something not expected for the price you pay.one other gripe is the awkward size of the sawzall.
5,A Must Have For Your Library!!,"I purchased this beauty along with Botanica's Roses, from Amazon. WOW was I delighted! Between the 2 I have almost every rose info I could imagine. It is well worth the money and a must have for every rosarian. I have 40 roses so far and found the info very useful in my continued purchases. (ex: I live in the NW and have wet weather...many roses dislike wet and don't open properly. The books reveal which are poor choices for my such climate. Now that is USEFUL information!)Of course it goes without saying that the author knows his roses and the pictures are, well, drop-dead gorgeous (as are in the Botanica's Roses book.)A 100% must have, along with Botanica's."
5,The first three tracks make it worth it!,"I absolutely LOVE this soundtrack! One of the best available! The first track I believe is called Shout it out! It's a fun heavy tune that promises a wild ride and deliveres! On to the second! Battlestations by Winger is EASILY the best song on the cd and is my favorite metal song of all time! I drive a 2010 VW Beetle, but when this song is going I can almost imagine myself driving a MONSTERTRUCK because this song is so intense and so great! I'm also x-army, so sometimes I can envision an Abrams tank blowing the enemy away! The third one is by Kiss called ""God Gave Rock And Roll To You"". I dunno, but somehow after Battlestations this much softer song seems kinda appropriate and is one of the best variations out of the three I know of.Bottom line? If you are looking for a soundtrack from a movie that is simply awesome than look no further than this! Although the movie was a goofy 'guy' movie, the soundtrack simply MUST be heard!"
1,toggle cap,"I bought a new switch to replace one used for the leveling gear on my 5th wheel. Since it was all apart, I wanted to replace the cap also. It did not fit the switch even though Amazon stated that the two were often purchased together. The package accidently got tossed so I did not send it back."
3,My Cheap A** Chinese made leaf blower thanks you,I bought this to go with a switch that I used to replace a switch on my cheap A** chinese made black & decker leaf blower. it seems to work pretty good but I have not weather tested it. Submerging an electric motor in water to test it just does not seem to be a great idea.
3,Very good strategy....good book.,"Well, this is an actual ""real"" review. You can choose to believe that or not. Anyway, I read the book years ago and implemented it's strategies on and off. In the past I'd win on 8 out of 10 trades. I'm currently doing it again and can go as long as 20 trades in a row without a loss. Sometime I hold for the dividend, sometimes I make money on the days leading up to the ex date. The only thing I feel is important to mention is that I ONLY do this with high dividend paying, diversified closed-end FUNDS!! I'd never try it with a stock of a single company. There are too many other forces at work that could cause you to get trapped in such a stock. It works better for me than any other strategy. It's low stress and a nice steady ride to early retirement."
5,Share a special bond with your daughter,"""Even More"" celebrates the special relationship between a mother and a daughter. Author Liz McGrath takes the reader on a trip along the cycle of life from the birth of a child to the birth of a grandchild. Along the way the mother finds ways to express how much she loves her daughter and the daughter also expresses her love for her mother. This is a wonderful book to show the young reader the strong bonds of love that exist (or at least should exist) between a daughter and a mother. This is a very well done bilingual book written in English and Spanish for children about four to eight years old. Sure to help the young reader understand how important they are to their parents, ""Even More"" is a highly recommended children's book."
1,God Save the Sweet Potato Queens,"I found the coarse humor not to be amusing. I also read The Sweet Potato Queens on Love. I wish I had not bought two of this author's books. I should have tried just one. There would not have been a second purchase. I imagined, from the description, that it would be more like the books written by Fanny Flagg. I have purchased all of Fanny Flagg's books from amazon and enjoyed every single one of them."
1,reread the first book instead,"I absolutely loved the first book - Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love. But the second book was *beyond* a disappointment for me. Almost every chapter starts with her discussing the first book - making it quite repetitive, and tiresome. The stories were not very funny and she really rambled on in this book. I nearly gave up on the book part way through (reason I'm giving it one star) but I have a policy about finishing something I've started. Anyhow, if you've read the first book, skip this one, and read the first one again. I'm definitely not passing this book on to my friends."
5,Wannabe a SPQ,"I did not believe it would be possible to enjoy a book as much as I did THE SWEET POTATO QUEENS' BOOK OF LOVE and then I found GOD SAVE THE SWEET POTATO QUEENS. Jill Conner Browne's wit and insight is just a sharpe in the second book as it was in the first.Of course not everyone will ""get it"" and for these folks I feel sorry, but don't give up. While you still breath there is still hope."
4,"This book makes me wanna go to Jackson, MS","After living in the little town of Vicksburg, MS for a year, I never thought anything in Jackson could be fun, but this book has convinced me that I need to go back. If not for nothing else than to see these fabolous women! Both books is great for any girl, no matter what age! It left me with a really happy feeling!"
2,no need for a sequel,"I absolutely loved the first book, and I was very dissapointed in this one. I do not know if I will even bother to get the Big Ass Cook Book. The theme was so repetitive from the first book and not near as funny. I was really wanting to love this book, but unfortunately, it will go in the pile to donate, unlike my first book with funny pages flagged. The website is somewhat humorous as well, but if you are a SPQ fan, stop after reading the first book."
2,Not up to par...,"Of course the only reason I read this book was because I enjoyed The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love. I was looking for more of the same light hearted humor. Unfortunately, this edition was a HUGE dissapointment. It felt like it was just a novel sized advertisemt for the first book. The passages were very hard to follow as they jumped from one topic to the next and then back again faster than you can blink an eye. This would not have been too hard to handle if the topics were in any way related, but they weren't. I will say that the chapter titles were entertaining and I did actually laugh out loud twice near the very end of the book, but what it took to get to those two laughs was a waste of my time.-One more thing, do no read this if you have not read the original book as there are so many references to SPQBOL that someone not familiar with it will be even more lost than I was, and I had actually read it less than a year ago."
2,Not at all what I thought.,"I really did not like this book. I love Southern humor, especially from women, but I found very little of this book truly funny."
3,Oh dear,"The first Sweet Potato Queens book was perfect. It was funny, insightful, sweet and even touching in places. Jill Conner Browne should've left it right there. This isn't as good as the first book and there were a few chapters that I actually skipped because they bored me. I guess the lesson here is when you get it right the first time you don't need a sequel."
5,Capuchin,"This book changed my life. I picked it up in an airport as I was leaving the country to work on my dissertation fieldwork. I couldn't put it down. Jill has such a wonderful sense of humor and outlook on life, I laughed out loud while reading it.I embraced Queendom and, more importantly, my friends. I got myself a tiara; there's just no way to stay frustrated, angry or depressed when you're wearing a tiara."
5,The Best of the Three,"This one is the funniest of the three SPQ books. It has priceless moments and for even greater enjoyment, listen to the audiobook read by the author. If you are offended by language or sexual comments, then steer clear. For the rest of us, this is a highly entertaining book and very motivating to aspiring wannabes. The end is bittersweet, but life's laughter often comes from our experiences, both good and bad."
3,Let's be honest...,"Okay, this book WAS humorous...at times; however, I can vividly remember thinking, ""Jeez, Erin, when is this book going to end?"" And complaining to my family, ""I think the chapters are mating with one another and producing new chapters."" At times I wanted to just slam the book down and then sometimes I was laughing my butt off! So, now you've realised two things 1. I talk to myself, and 2. The book is okay. At the very least the book is worth buying if you want to make Doo-dah Chicken for that elderly rich man that just won't die!"
3,If I could just dress like this for one day...I'd die happy,"Just looking at the covers of the Sweet Potato Queen books brings a smile to your face. And Lord knows, I have the attitude to be a queen. Once again, Jill Browne has allowed us entry into the wit and wisdom of the SPQ and all you can do is hang on for the ride. This second book does not disappoint, it will have you nodding your head with recognition and laughing out loud. (Do not take this to church as something to read if the service gets too boring). This brought me back to my growing up days in Texas, where I longed to be like several incarnations of the Sweet Potato Queen in my home town. Once again, I have to go against the popular opinion.....it is a wickedly funny look at the ways men and women relate, but the overdose of vulgarity wears thin."
2,Sticky,"This smells wonderful, but it doesn't last. Plus my underarms were sticky after I aplied it untill it stoped working.It would work better if it was a roll on."
5,Maybe the best album ever,I bought this album many years ago and I still listen to it often. There can be few pieces of music so coherent as a whole yet with so many great individual songs. Marian's voice is as good as ever.Don't dither - just buy it.
1,Not what it looks like,"I bought this thinking that it was as large as a bed, since it is pictured covering an entire bed. When I received it in the mail, it was a huge disappointment. It is rough and scratchy, tiny, and not worth th $30 something that I paid for it."
3,Zokkoman DVD,"Even tho the concept of a 14 yo ""iron man"" was a cool idea from Disney, the movie was very disappointing, more story, bad comedy, than action, I expected this ""superhero"" to do more than just float and talk in a harsh voice, it lacks action, maybe i expected more from Disney,at less than $10.00 Im glad the price was such that i dont feel i wasted my money."
3,The Timeless Banger,"This cd was fresh when it first came out,however listening to some of it now might give the impression of being wack! Not dissing,cause the song-Smooth, will forever be a banger!"
3,Fast delivery,"fast delivery, product delivered in great shape, but product didn't get rid of fleas, still have the problem."
1,wild orchids,I am a very loyal reader of Jude Deveraux.I buy every book the first day it comes out. I was very dissopointed in this book.I had to make my self finish reading it.
2,*sigh*,"I am so disappointed. Not only were the characters dull, but it left me absoloutely cold. I have laughed, cried and lived in Jude's world for a very long time. I live in Scandinavie, so getting my hands on her books is very difficult for me. This time I have to say', it wasn't worth it. And to make it even worse, there was a flaw in the printing of it, so I there were 50. pages missing and 50 pages written again. All in all. The biggest disappointment yet."
1,Ugh!,"I confess that I'm not a big fan of romance novels; however, I have read and enjoyed some of Devereaux's books in the past. This book was one big disappointment! I didn't enjoy the muddy plot and less than compelling characters (so much more could have been done with this motley crew!!), and I especially didn't enjoy inviting the devil to be part of the story! Why??? She could have gone in so many excellent directions but she chose not to do that and she lost me before I got to the end. I kept pushing on, hoping for something better, but I stopped reading not long after the devil started visiting. A friend gave it to me ""for keeps"" but I definitely didn't keep it! Jude...I haven't read a lot of your work, but I've read enough to know that you're better than this and I can certainly make better use of my time!!"
2,Weird,"I bought the book expecting it to be one of her romance novels. I didn't read the reviews first. At one point it got so freaky on me that I had to put it down. I don't like reading about the devil. That's not my cup of tea. I'm a Christian. I did finish it, but I wouldn't have read it in the first place if I had read the reviews first. Obviously it was a big disappointment for me."
2,Too scary for me!,Not the usual Jude Deveraux story at all....didn't realize until the last few chapters that the DEVIL played a huge part. I thought it was HORRIBLE! Although I did like the story up until this point. CREEPY! Had to sleep with the light on!
1,Sad to see her go,I have read every book that Jude Deveruax has ever written and I must say I am very disappointed in her last three books. It's as if someone else is writing them. The spark she use to have seems to be fizzling out. I miss the old Jude Deveraux
3,"Decent, not wonderful.","Overall, this book was interesting and fun to read. I have two complaints. The first is that there is VERY little romance, just a lot of built up tension between the two main characters but Jude takes way too long for them to get together. Also, the book is pretty slow on action. A lot of the scenes are just people hanging around and while it is interesting, it gives the book a ""drag on"" feeling. Like you wish something exciting would happen. Overal, a good read though."
2,BIzarre.......and only for lovers of the supernatural,"This story just didn't work for me. For much of it I felt that Deveraux was struggling to fill the number of pages required by her editor or publisher, taking numerous paragraphs to define a character's state of mind and body in three or four slightly different ways when the fact is it had been quite clear in a couple of short sentences how the character was feeling at that time. The story never gripped me and if I hadn't been confined while nursing a loved one I probably would have skimmed the end and then put it in the pile to be donated to my local library. I found the ending to be unsatisfying not to mention bizarre and unbelievable. This book was a waste of my time and money and reaffirms my belief that some books make (and linger on) the list of best sellers for reasons other than their content."
5,"If you love the impossible, read this book","I read this book after reading another JD novel, ""Knight in Shining Armor."" I thought it was really good because it wasn't along the lines of every other novel out there. Some parts of this book were kinda unbelievable, but it was a great plotline overall."
1,How did this book get published?,"Probably one of the worst books I ever read. Actually, I couldn't even finish it-it was so bad. The story is written from the point of view of the two main characters, a man and a women. The character development is poor and erratic and the story is sooooooooooooo boring. I picked this book up in an airport thinking it would get me through a long international flight- boy was I wrong!"
2,BORING !!!,"Sorry to say this but this is the worst books i've ever read,i could not believe it that it was a Jude Deveraux book,my gosh ! I was so bored with this book that i almost didn't finish it,it took me a week to read this and in that week i read two other books while in the middle of reading another,i've never done that before ! So disappointed,i love Jude's books but this one was bad,sorry...The chapters of this book is what one character thinks of the situation then the next chapter is about what the other thinks,ugh,sorry it was just boring and redundant...BIG DISAPPOINTMENT from a huge JUDE DEVERAUX fan ...."
2,Disappointed,"I have thoroughly enjoyed other books written by Jude Deveraux, but Wild Orchids was truly a disappointment. The attempted use of separate chapters written from each of the main characters point of view was boring and badly done. Each chapter reiterated the other for at least a page. I did think that the novel had an interesting & unique plot, but would suggest reading another Deveraux work before this one."
2,Scared the bejebies out of me,"This is not her normal fare! As others have pointed out, this is not a romance. This is more in the Stephen King genre than romance. Yeh, there is someone falling in love, but it is secondary to the character change and the character insights. I did not like it-I also don't like horror genre or vampire novels. If you like that sort, it is a well written story. But if you are looking for a romance, stick to her old stuff or another author."
2,Deveraux is no longer a Romance Author,"This newest offering from Deveraux has left me with no hope for another good classic Deveraux romance. While Ms. Deveraux seems to be toying with the dark side in her most recent novels, I have been seeking out other authors who can still supply me with what a good historical romance. (Kathleen Givens, anyone?) When I pick up a book in the romance section, I expect just that, romance.While I understand that Ms. Deveraux is branching out in her writing, I would ask that she please target these offerings to a new audience. I have every single Deveraux book. Wild Orchids will be my last."
3,Wild Orchids,"The CDs had a deep scratch on each disc, but it only cut out about 7 minutes of talk on each. The story was still understood. Service was great and fast."
4,I just kept saying oh my goodness!,"Ford, what a great name for a man, but Jake is the best. Anyway, from death by drunk driver, to childhood injuries, to millionaire. I loved this book. However that whole thing with the devil, it took on a new twist. I say read it and form your own opinions. I read what everyone else had to say and I still thought it was a great read and a good book. I've read quite a few of Judes books, this was one of the better ones. But the Summerhouse will all ways be my favorite. Thanks for that one."
5,Great book!,I really enjoyed this one. It was well written and very easy to follow. It kept my interest from the first page. Keep up the good work Jude.
1,Still haven't fixed previous versions errors.,"I purchased this map as a hopeful update to an earlier version of the same map. The only problem is that all the forest service road & trail errors that I had to deal with in my previous version were still present. That is not a particularly good thing if you plan on relying on the map while out in the woods. I have since returned this map for a refund.If you are interested in purchasing a map that has accurate forest service, BLM, and state trails and roads, I would recommend the Benchmark Road and Recreational Atlas. If all you want is a topographical map of the state, then this should work."
4,almost too detailed,"great map, now have oregon and washington, almost too detailed, be sure to have an overview hwy map for the big picture."
5,As expected...,"Gazetteer has a great deal of information including camping, hiking, paddling, and biking locations. Many trails throughout the Olympic Peninsula are easily identifiable on the topographic maps."
4,Holster Clip,Holster clip protects and secures firearm in holster as advertised. Recommend to hunters that use stalking methods. Will buy again.
3,I'm addicted!,"Really enjoy this for the most part, but I continually run into this issue as stated by two other reviewers who state: ""For one thing the game will end and I will get ""game over"" when I still have letters that I can play and options for playing them. This is especially frustrating when I am only a few points behind! Also it seems like over time the game begins to give me multiples over and over, such as four ""i""s or four ""g""s.It happens repeatedly, so it seems to be more of a glitch than just coincidence."" and the second reviewer says ""When playing a higher level computer competitor, I often end up with a rack full of vowels. This happens so frequently that I'm forced to make several exchanges during the course of the game, thereby entitling the computer to invariably emerge victorious.""This happens over and over, especially at the Veteran level and above. If not a rack of vowels, then rack after rack of letters only worth one point."
3,Scrabble,"I ordered this game several months ago. I have had many hours of fun with it, but over time several problems began to occur. For one thing the game will end and I will get ""game over"" when I still have letters that I can play and options for playing them. This is especially frustrating when I am only a few points behind! Also it seems like over time the game begins to give me multiples over and over, such as four ""i""s or four ""g""s.It happens repeatedly, so it seems to be more of a glitch than just coincidence."
4,scrabble pc,The game is fun. What I enjoy most and what got my to upgrade from scrabble complete is the newest words are playable. Like za. I only play against the computer and find it good for that.
3,Champion Shampion!,"I purchased this version of Scrabble because of its updated dictionary -- the previous ""Complete"" edition doesn't recognize ""qi"" and ""za"", among others, as words.Is it me or is the game rigged? When playing a higher level computer competitor, I often end up with a rack full of vowels. This happens so frequently that I'm forced to make several exchanges during the course of the game, thereby entitling the computer to invariably emerge victorious. Harumph! I've always enjoyed the game but my ego's been bruised and battered during what has now become a love-hate relationship."
1,Will not run on a netbook without a cd drive.,"I'm sure the game is good but I purchased the game for my grandmother because it's the version she's used to from her old pc and tried to install it on her new netbook (which has no cd drive) via iso/virtual drive. Game will not run. Apparently, the physical cd must be in a physical cd drive in order for the game to run. Complete waste of my money. Very disappointed because I spent many hours looking for the right version."
1,Doesn't Run -Minimal redesign of old product with copy protection,"The game does not run without the CD the drive (in this day and age this is ridiculous) - and my copy doesn't run at all. I installed it and played about 3 games. The next day I put the CD in the drive and it wanted to reinstall and the drive kept spinning and spinning. Came out with a copy protection message telling me to I needed the Original CD, contacted the Copy protection people and they tried to help but weren't able to. Now I am stuck with no real way to contact Encore, but I can send the disk back and wait for a replacement in 4 to 6 weeks and see if this helps, which it may not. So I have a useless product, would return for my money back but already submitted for a rebate so am stuck with product that doesn't work.The game is a very poor redesign of an older version in addition to hokey copy protection software that makes it inoperable"
1,Disgusted with DRM restrictions,"I love Scrabble. I love practicing against the computer, which this games allows me to do. I *HATE* how this game requires me to have the original CD in the drive at all times in order for me to play it. I can't install it and put the cd away. I can't make a backup copy of the CD in case the original gets messed up. I have a laptop with a detachable CD drive, which I rarely carry. I had purchased this product with the intention of installing it on my laptop so I could play when I travel. All the dumb restrictions on this software don't allow for me to use it in what I'd consider to be a very typical situation. Do yourself a favor and skip this product. Don't support crippleware..."
2,Disappointing!,"Great graphics and heads-up gameplay, but I much prefer the Infogrames Scrabble in the red box, which allowed you to play against 2 or even 3 computer players. This version is well-done but too limited."
1,Faulty product release -- no laptop support!,"Are you a Scrabble fan who owns a laptop? Then forget this product -- you likely won't be able to install it, regardless of your operating system.Incredibly, Encore has released a product that only runs on desktop machines. And, more galling, the package doesn't reflect this limitation. So you have to buy the game, try to install it, and when you can't (and it may crash your system; it did mine) you have to go to the web site to find out the publisher's engineers dismissed those of us who migrated to laptop technology. In essence, their lack of support for portables says: too bad.I'm thinking of a seven-letter, two-word phrase to describe my reaction to this astonishingly cavalier ruse by Encore. Can you think of it?"
4,Great game,I love this game and play it nearly every day. My only complaint is that the dictionary is very limiting. It should hold a standard dictionary.
4,Good product,"I like the product & it allows me to play Scrabble several ways; I wish I had known before hand that I need to have the disc in to play Scrabble. That really is no big deal, but the whirring sound is distracting when I'm on the computer for other reasons, so I leave the disc out until I'm ready to play. The price was right :)"
3,Holy Spirit,"This book proved to be over my head. Were I an advanced Seminary student, I might have been more able to understand the text. It reminded me of college courses taken where the professor was eminently knowledgable but could not easily transmit that same knowledge to students in an understandable manner."
3,Good book.,"Professor of Systematic theology at Westminister Theological Seminary (Philadelphia), Sinclair Ferguson' work on the Holy Spirit is tight and written from a Reformed stance. I recommend it. Although it is not as comprehensive as one would like, it nevertheless deals with all the issues. Ferguson's discussion on tongues and the Lord's supper are highlights.I did find some of his conclusions a bit strectched, but overall this book is worth the price."
4,"It's comprehensive, all right!","This sure is a complete reference for the American Civil War. My only complaint would be that I thought at least something would be in color, but it is all black and white, which gives it the feel of a book from my grandmother's attic. It's still a great book, I just was expecting it to look more current."
5,complete reference,"There is so much information in this book it is ridiculous. I have found new sources just by flipping through this book. Every entry is detailed. Many different facets of the war are covered such as political, military, and socioeconomic issues. This is a true all encompassing source to the American Civil War! It is well worth the money."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDER,"What you have shown is not what i received. I want to return the product and get my money back. I have not opened the product only the package and to find by surprise what is shown is not what I received. [...]Sincerely,Debbie Mason"
3,"OK, not great literature","I enjoy reading about Arctic regions, so I was already leaning favorably toward this book. The descriptions of past expeditions and current habitat and wildlife are well done, but the portrayed dialogues come off quite stilted and are not so good. If you're an ""arctic fan"" you can enjoy this; the photos included, albeit few, are simply wonderful.But if you ask me, I'd recommend Lopez' ""Arctic Dreams"" for a better read."
4,very good for little ones,"great resource for small children, but wouldrecommend instead the book for preschoolerswhich has more information and techniques fortoddlers."
2,Not attachment-parenting friendly,"I bought this book hoping for practical advice on guiding my one-year-old's behavior that was compatible with attachment parenting. I was disappointed to find myself reading the familiar blather about how babies should cry it out to learn ""independence"" and weaned at 12 months - This book mentions Erikson's theory of a baby learning trust vs. distrust, but then goes on to advocate cry it out - confused, to say the least. As far as the practical advice on toddlers goes, there was some but a lot of it was too general to be much help. This book's condescending tone toward the family bed and extended breastfeeding really annoyed me. Anyone who thinks these make a baby dependant and demanding ought to meet my daughter! If she had it her way she'd get her own apartment at two! :)"
2,Not very helpful for children who can't speak yet,"Let me first say that I am all for the ""positive"" discipline approach; however, I did not find this book to be very helpful for a child who is not yet able to communicate verbally. Although this book does give some helpful information that I feel you can use with older children, when it comes to the ""target"" age (up to age 3), it fails to meet up to my expectations. This book assumes that you can ""reason"" with your child by explaining things to him/her. I've never seen an eleven-month-old yet who could be dealt with in this way. If you're looking for suggestions for discipling the much younger child, you should probably try another book."
2,Outdated and opposed to attachment parenting,Positive discipline and CIO (cry it out) should not mix. Author recommends cry it out methods though recent investigation has taught us not to do it. Also discourages people from co-sleeping and nursing past the year.Do not recommend it for people looking and invested in attachment parenting
4,Excellent source for an educated approach to discipline.,"I found this book to be an excellent source for an educated approach to discipline. As the authors state, the word ""discipline"" means ""to teach."" Although the book got off to a slow start, the authors provide a thorough synopsis of the great educators and sociologists of our time, and present the material in a manner that does not require a college education to understand. The approach suggested by the authors has proven to be very effective with my 13 month twins. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn how to TEACH our children, not punish them."
4,"Changing the way you think about ""discipline""","I really believe in most of what this author has to offer. Her methods of discipline are logical and focused on increasing you and your child's problem solving skills. Most of what she has to say is founded on the principle that everyone is basically good and your child is really not usually TRYING to make your life difficult. She advocates not using punishment as a means of disciplining your child, which is contrary to what most people believe. It takes work to master this method and reverse your thinking about discipline, but this book is certainly worth your time. My only criticisms of this book are that she advocates ""crying it out"" as a way of getting your child to sleep. Also, although she doesn't say it outright, you get a strong sense that she isn't really a supporter of extended breastfeeding. Otherwise, I really did enjoy this book."
1,Not what I consider positive at all (m),"This book is anti-co-sleeping, suggests use of a playpen, and has a discussion of how a baby as young as two months can be spoiled if held too much. If you are looking for an Attachment Parenting book, then keep looking and let this go. I also hated the clip-art of cribs and bottles all over the place! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,positive discipline: the first three years,"Very nice and sweet, but otherwise quite useless. You won't find anything new in this book: if you have any common sence, you already know everything the authors have to say."
2,Malarky,"1. Don't hit your kids.2. Don't waste your time reading this book.What IS it with children's books? Millions are sold every year. Yet the vast majority are just the detailed opinions of individuals. Sure, these individuals have fancy degrees. But where is their data? Can they support their claims that parenting by their techniques does more good than harm? Are there longitudinal studies of any kind? Of course not. Don't waste your time and money reading this woman's opinions.They're sort of silly to boot. For example, she says that picking up a child who can walk is disrespectful because you're denying them the chance to walk. Give me a break."
3,"In Plain Language, But Watch It...","Nelson (along with Cheryl Erwin and Roslyn Duffy) presents yet another ""parent workshop""-in-book-form concerning how appropriately to discipline a child. In this case, she focuses on 0-3 year olds. Like her other books, the philosophy reads well, but whereth thine credible references?Again, no Galinsky, Bronfenbrenner, Lawrence-Lightfoot, Brazelton/Greenspan, or Comer citations exist within her writing. Any parent-related book of serious integrity would include ideas from these foundational experts.Nevertheless, I can say that her philosophy falls in proximity of their ideas.Not a bad book to keep on the shelf, but I suggest using other, more scholarly texts, in conjunction with this one."
2,"Quicken is much better; did funny things to my computer, too","I needed to get a will done for my wife and myself, and was attracted to this by the price. It turned out not to be particularly useful. I found it clunky and difficult to use, and the help features are very weak. What's more, this is the only program of many I have installed on my computer, and it caused some minor installation problems, continually prompting me to install additional software, and giving me headaches as I had to exit out of each prompt.I got Quicken Willmaker for free along with a download of a different Intuit program, and found it much easier, and much more user friendly.So, all in all, not a terribly good buy, even for the bargain price. My advice would be to keep shopping, and spend a little more to get a better program."
1,Weird,I had high hopes for this video because I'd read that there are healing powers in sounds. But there is a very irritating high pitch spinning noise on the background of this video that I just can't figure out. I couldn't even continue to watch to see what she was saying. The background noise was almost making me feel sick. This one has already been retired to the shelf.
5,Classic New Jack Swing !,"When 'YOU CAN'T PLAY ME' first came out I had it as a 12"" Single and used to play it out like crazy. They were really popular here in Boston and that song was everywhere. Well, over the years I lost the 12"" and couldnt remember the name of the group or the song for the life of me. You would think I would, but my mind went blank. Anyways, I came across someone on facebook who was posting all videos by Boston groups and needless to say 4 FUN was one of the videos. My face lit up and I was so happy to come across it again. To have this song and the full CD in my posession once again is like going back to my teenage years. Gotta love it."
5,Glad I found the disc!!!,"I first heard this cd was in a sound warehouse in San Antonio Texas...had to have it!!! Wonderful, I just can't understand why this group didn't blow up BIG!!!! I lost this cd in a car theft and went on the hunt for it. Have not received the disc yet but, my neighbors will know when it arrives!!! HA!"
5,best ever,absolutely the best stereo speakers ever. a fantastic example of speakers that give you a perfect perceived 3d sound. no need for any 5.1 system!
4,Excelent sound quality. Not so good song selection,This is a true audiophile disc. I'd give it 5 stars if the tracks selection was as good as the sound quality. I'd actually give it a 9/10 rate.Cheers and enjoy !!!
4,Put It Right ON the Fret Or You'll Go Sharp!,"I got mine from B and G Music Assoc Inc -- they had the best price and FREE shipping!Props to them!However, I'm such a newb that I put it a little above the first fret, rather than right on it. And, ohmygoodness, my uke went soooooooooo sharp!Thankfully, I googled, and I'm not the only one who's made that mistake!"
4,Kyser Banjo/Mandolin capo,I am very pleased with this item. I had been looking in my area and could notfind what I was looking for. But was successful on Amazon.
5,"Kyser Banl, Mandolin Capo",I use this capo all the time on both instruments. A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also. I did and they love it!
5,The right one for me,"I like this style because it's quick, though not quite as secure as the screw-down type. This replaces one I lost, which lasted many years."
5,Kyser Is The Cadillac,"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo. They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do. The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well. You can never go wrong with a Kyser. Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company. I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job. They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much. This Kyser will last a long, long time."
1,Never heard of most products,"I had high hopes for this glycemic index to food products. However, most items listed seem to be from Australia, Canada and South Africa and I don't recognize the brand names. The book does not have enough useful information. I am very disappointed."
2,Too technical,"Even though the book contains alot of useful information--if you are a scientist, I found it to be frustrating for someone trying to manage a weight loss program. My mistake was to purchase this book before the program book. I am hoping it will be a better reference tool than an explanation for a diet."
3,Eureka... I finally found it! NOT!,"I've been looking for a good list of food items with their respective Glycemic Index Numbers. Heard the Author on a radio show and rushed to get her book. I was disappointed because I was looking for ""real"" and ""naturally basic"" foods, and not packaged or ""doctored"" foods. EG- plain yogurt, no-fat yogurt... v.s yogurts sweetened with fruits/ sugar/ or sweeteners."
4,good,I am interisting at pacemaker implantation. This book lets me know the procedure able the pacemaker implantation and notice.
5,This Trio Cooks,"Eddie Green was a name unknown to me until I heard a cut from This One's For You. The man swings his a-- off with a very tight rhythm section of Tyrone Brown on bass and Jim Miller on drums. Track 1 kicks it off with a blazing version of Sam Jones's Unit Seven, and Green keeps his foot on the gas for a smokin' original, Skeeter's Kitchen, with a beat so blues drenched it could get the dead to start hip shakin'. Even his ballads, including All The Things You Are and Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most, have a beautiful bluesy feel to them. Green, for a blazer, really knows how to evoke emotions at any tempo. Sound quality is excellent. I rate this CD among the top piano trios I have, including such marvelous players as Kenny Barron, Mulgrew Miller, Derek Smith, Eric Reed, John Hicks, Mike LeDonne, Michael Jefry Stevens, and Cyrus Chestnut. If you're into bluesy, cookin' piano trios who know how to vary the menu, add Eddie Green's This One's For You to your collection."
5,BEautiful,"I don't know much about classical music, but I know what sounds wonderful, and this whole CD is amazing, especially Chaconne, which is why I bought this in the first place. I do like the Jascha Heifetz version better, but that song was his masterpiece. This is just a gorgeous CD, and I highly recommend it."
4,Loud but inexpensive and fast,"The fan is loud, and on one of the three I bought the fan bearings are REALLY loud. However, the thing is really fast and really inexpensive for being able to provide VLANs and QOS for a LAN. I bought two for the office because of the trunking feature but have not used/tested it yet because it is plenty fast without it."
3,"autobiographical, disheveled but brutally honest account","if you are looking for a book depicting the gore and horror of war from the standpoint of an infantry soldier you will be disappointed.. if however , you are are looking for a primer on how war destroys the soul you have conme to the right place ... of particular interest is ""asian"" reaction of the author to his childhood girlfriends rape by a group of soldiers ... the book reads more like a wim wenders movie than oliver stone .. the author jumps between ther poast and present . and the book seems to be more of a stream of consciousness than the telling of an actual story .. but the war in vietnam was not a story .. it was pure horror ... and horror is what this author captures"
4,A vivid view from the 'enemy' perspective.,"This story provided a view of North Vietnamese teenagers' life as he became involved in the war with the South and ultimately the U. S. It confirms what so many of us who spent time there have come to understand. That the war - for all of us who participated - was totally beyond our control and comprehension. Young Kein's entire life changes from optimism and promise to hopelessness and futility. His relationship with his childhood sweetheart crumbles as the war progresses. She too is forever changed by the events portrayed in this period of over 10 years. This would not have been a readable, understandable story for me in the '70s but after close to 30 years since I was involved, it was very worthwhile."
3,Depressing and boring some times,"The author clearly had a lot of terrible experiences during the Vietnam War and tries hard to convey the feeling of depression, sorrow and loss he suffered personally. There are though many jumps in time, back and forward, and the bigger part of the book is not about the war itself but about the women the hero (Kien) loved and lost. The war remains always as a horrible background with only a few glimpses of it, where each one represents the death of Kien's one dear comrade. The text is very well written and with great artistic power but don't expect terrific battle accounts or many things regarding the military life of the PAVN rank and file. The story is a fine piece of literature but not of much historical value for anyone who wants to learn the everyday life of the North Vietnamese soldiers."
4,Translation is always difficult.,The book is well-written and heart-rending. The difficult and dreary times seen through the eyes of a North Vietnamese soldier is all too real. The descriptions of living at home in Hanoi during the bombing war is stark and depressing.
4,A memorable novel.,"This book will stay with you, in its quiet sadness, romance and powerful images of conflict. It leaves you with a feeling of knowing the author deeply, because he is brave enough to write about his flaws, loneliness, and weaknesses as well as his heroism. That is to assume of course that this story is a barely concealed autobiography- indeed the author is one of only ten survivors out of five hundred who fought in the war with his brigade. It is at once an image not only of how people are lost in war, but lost in peacetime too."
4,"A fair literary work, an excellent portrayal of Viet Nam by the North.","This text does indeed read like a journal. The closing of the book suggests that it is indeed a journalish/novel discovered. I'm left to wonder if the book was written like this on purpose, or if ineed there was a 'discovered memoir.'That said, it jumps around alot, but encompases the main character's throughout, and therefore shows the lifetime effect of the war.My father was a front line linguist in the army, and never talks about it. I have a little understanding as to why.While this text 'humanizes' the North Vietnamese, by all means, as some comments suggest, they were not the helpless victim. Forget not the shameful acts of so-called academia in the poor and hate treatment to our own soldiers upon returning from Nam. Grr!Not a great literary text, but definately a good journal to give insight into war."
4,A haunting memoir of the War.,"The author was a North Vietnamese ""bo doi"" who was sent south to liberate Saigon. He participated in many battles in central Vietnam.The world of the ""bo doi"" like that of any soldier was dominated by fears of death, desertion, drug use, and nightmares. Ghosts haunted them almost daily and forests scared them.Despite their sacrifices, they did not get any recognition when they came home from the war: no drums, no music and had to resign to live with ""broken dreams and with pain"". The stress of the war was too much for many of them: they got drunk, fought with their wives or girl friends, experienced nightmares, wild mood changes, and rage.They suffered from the full range of post traumatic stress disorders American soldiers were experiencing on their return from the war. And above all, they questioned themselves whether the war was worth it."
3,Great Gag gift for my brother.,I got this as a gag gift for my brother who asked for a snow board for Christmas. Did the trick.
1,PRINT TOO SMALL,THE KINDLE BOOK FOR FOUNDATIONS OF GEOMETRY BY DAVID HILBERT HAS PRINT THAT IS VERY SMALL AND CAN NOTBE CHANGED USING THE Aa KEY. I AM WRITING THIS IN THE HOPES THAT THIS FAULT WILL BE CORRECTED
3,Small Print,We got this for my daughter to use to do research for a paper. The print on the screen was very small and could not be adjusted. This made it very hard to read.
5,A TRIP ON NEIL'S JOURNEY,I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK THAT WAS PURE NEIL AT HIS BEST. ANY FAN WOULD APPRECIATE THIS EXPLOSION OF GUITAR SOUNDS THAT TICKLE THE MIND WITH SUSPENCE. I WANTED THE COLLECTORS EDIT TO CHECK OUT THE PICTURES INCLUDED.
2,a soundtrack for your nightmares,"a soundtrack that is as wierd as the movie itself. there are some good pictures of neil looking pretty ugly though, and that makes it all worthwhile. although the special packaging is pretty neat, this is for diehard fans only."
2,Disapointing. Weak. Schmaltzy.,"Junior needs to stay within the realms of humor and showing off. His ""serious"" songwriting sounds weak and thin. I'll still check out the next one, what with his previous stuff having been so entertaining, but I don't see this one coming out of the case again anytime soon."
2,A slight departure for Junior Brown,"Long Walk Back takes a few unusual turns as Junior, like most artists, attempts to ""expand"" his musical horizons after experiencing success. There are some solid Junior Brown songs here, but there are also a few that are not what we're used to hearing from the master of the guit-steel. The effort is there but the target is not hit. Of Junior's four full-length CDs, this one ranks last. Here's hoping for a strong comeback next time in which Junior gets back to playing straight honky-tonk country is his own unique way."
1,Most disappointing,I own every piece of music Junior has produced and consider him to be one of the finest musicians around today. I have had the opportunity to marvel at his guitar work from three feet away. Contrary to Billboard and other rag reviews I feel this is the worst Junior has to offer. I would not reccomned this to anyone.
3,Need a half star please...,"A good but very average release from Mr. Brown. Not great, but not bad either, and certainly not one of his best. Would have given this one an extra half star for ""stupid blues"" which almost manages to pick this CD up to above average material. Almost. I'm however not regretting buying this CD by no means."
5,Cheikh Lo,"Sunny, unwinding, joyfull, cosy. Cheikh Lo has a great voice and rhythm in his heart.... Makes you happy and makes you dance - well, at least it made me."
1,Unhelpful study guide,"The contents proved to be unrelated to the exam for the masters license in Georgia. The material lacks depth, seems to be put together hastily, the explanations over simplified."
3,works but kind of costly,I ordered this as I was tired of the other style clogging. It works but is not any better than other style.Heather
5,Hand held put sticky tape on something to close thing.,"For my purposes, this is more useful than the gun handled plastic tape depressor thing. This is more comfortable in the hand and not quite as ungainly as the other. My little sister complained about the first one because she's challenged and it's difficult to use if you only do smaller packages, which she does a lot of. So I bought her one of these, (and now I have one too) and she loves it! You can also invert this one and use it like a regular desk dispenser. I'm aware that commercial places like UPS would use the other because they have the space and it probably puts tape on quicker than this one. But who needs fast at home when there's no hurry? This one's also lighter in weight than the other. Makes her 80 yr. old mom quite happy with that too."
5,Classic!,"This was a present for my husband and as soon as he got it, he played it in our car CD player right away. I thought I only knew one song, but hearing all of the songs made me realize I've heard most of them...and they were good. Our 3-year old even loves it. He would complain if we turn down the volume.The band is wonderful...their style, music, and lyrics! Would recommend it...especially for nostalgic reasons."
4,Let's dance for awhile!,"Forever Young! I want to be forever young! The title track belogs to syth-pop classics. Unique, wonderful and stirring melody with majestic lyrics have made this song evergreen classic. Big in Japan is another a big song for Alphaville including Japanese sounds and feelings.Please, I you heard Guava's cover for this song, shut the radio immediately. It's the most horrible cover ever made. Sounds like a Melody is also rather a well-known song, which has made cover called You Got the Let the Music( I don't remember the band but melody is taken for Alphaville). There is also forgotten classics for exemple Victory of Love and Fallen Angel. Victory of Love starts slowly but the end of the song makes me dance. There are some lesser good tracks Germany with love and Lies but luckily whole is a fine packet."
3,Forever Young,"I first heard the song Forever Young in a commercial for New Zealand tourism. I am a fan of good music and although my taste in music leans toward classic rock, blues, and jazz, I appreciate a great ""POP"" song and this one is a classic. The rest of the album is decent and tolerable, but for me Forever Young is the heartbeat of the album."
5,coming of age,This album opened up a whole new musical world for me. I still have the tape I recorded in 1987...and I listened to it this morning.
4,need a call please,"i just downloaded three songs for the first time from this site and one didn't download. there is no recourse and no way to contact anyone. i will never use amazon for music again and hope everyone uses other sites to purchase electronic data. this is not okay. if this doesn't post, i'd appreciate a call from a rep at amazon to discuss my problem.. 704-907-8240. it's been only minutes since my download and the only ""help"" available says if i wait to long the song is no longer available.sydney coffinsydcoffin@aol.com"
2,"James Brown's the top, but it's all downhill from there.","His records were mixed super-compressed for AM radio. And they were all in one key, all in 4.So?James Brown was the greatest. GREATEST. An innovator. Unmatched. Unsurpassed. His music will stand the test of time. Can't take nuthin away for that. Should be 5 stars.The record SOUNDS awful. The remixes aren't very interesting. Whatever these guys know about music, funk, soul or hip-hop isn't showing here, other than their ineptitude, their lack of study, thus a lack of respect. How can you not respect the Godfather??For shame."
4,A change of cast leaves me wanting the earlier seasons.,"Year Five brought about cast changes that disrupted the chemistry of the series. While the mysteries were still good, our favorite characters were disappearing. The trouble started the year before when Lovejoy, in his usual financial troubles, lost his home.Now this year Lady Jane Feldsham is bankrupt & selling her mansion. She had always been untouchably rich and stable, a rudder to keep the gang steering on course. Now she is adrift & leaving the series.Add to that Eric's desire to leave and take over his uncle's pub, now some of the ingredients of a good stew have been left out.Beth was a nice addition, but not enough to fill in all of the gaps.I still liked the series, and this year has grown on me with repeat viewings, but the gang is not all here (and will not return)."
1,Season five is a waste of money,"This is the destruction of a great series, they changed characters and have very poor scripts compared to the first four seasons. I did not like any of the episodes in this season, and I loved some of the episodes from previous seasons. The worst is they lost Lady Jane and tried to replaced her with several mediocre characters none of the actresses as good as Phyllis Logan. Her interaction and the sexual tension with Lovejoy were one of the central themes of the series. It looks like they thought Charlotte Cavendish could replace her, but none of the scripts really did anything with this character or developed more than an antagonistic relationship with Lovejoy. I wish I had not wasted my money on this season, if I had seen this season first I would have never purchased the first four."
5,A Wonderful Series!,"My husband and I enjoy Lovejoy so much! We've bought each season as it's been released, and watch them over and over. Highly recommended."
4,Good choices,"A lot of music--notes are skimpy--both as to the singers and the music--should have had a discussion of mezzos vs contraltos--I had mistakenly said I didn't receive this, but it was a similar CD I did not receive--"
1,Guitar cable,"Complete JUNK, Quit ater 2 weeks VERY light use compared to some very EL CHEAPO crap cables I got 3 for 10 bucks, at least 1 still works.Just paying for a stupid name."
1,Overpriced junk,"I have two of these cables, both same problem, they died quickly. I don't want a replacement I want my money back.One died right in the middle of a public well paid performance of Godspell with a horrible buzzing noise, embarrassing as hell, I was in a panic, it was in a quiet section, it took me a few seconds to reach over and kill the amp. The cable was a recent purchase, ironically I paid the high price to make sure that I was absolutely free of problems during my performance.Made in China, BTW.Do not buy this."
3,Monster Cable Standard,"Great product, works ok, it is pretty similar to the Planet Wave cables, thats my opinion. Buy one, you wont be dissapointed."
3,"Great, but not what I ordered","The product is great! The sound is clean and much better than the Live Wire Advantage cable I had before. BUT... The picture has a right angle and a straight cable. That is what I ordered, but instead I got two straight cables, which is not what I wanted. Oh well I guess."
2,Not what I ordered,"Ditto what T. Meziane said ... nice quality cables, but not what I ordered. I purchased these specifically for keyboards; I really needed a right-angle on one end, but what I got was straight on both ends. Since both right-angle and straight are both pictured and listed separately, I was expecting right-angle cables. Kinda disappointing considering I ordered 4 at the same time. Guess I gotta settle for whatever Guitar Center has in the store that I can actually see before buying."
4,There's more to it than blue notes,"The aspiring jazz musician can learn a lot from those takes. This is not light entertainment : every session is a lesson in itself. It stimulates your mind and tickles your fingers. Don't expect background music : you must be prepared to sit listening intently for a few hours, but you will be rewarded for the effort feeling enlightened and delighted, albeit slightly dazed at the size of the project. Also, the sound engineers did quite a good job there."
2,Performance issue,"The mini massager does a poor job. The four ""fingers"" are spaced to far apart to target the muscle group my wife wants to target. You cannot put ANY pressure on the mini massager to target muscles then it will stop working. It does very little massaging."
4,"ATTRACTIVE,NON-BULKY","EASY INSTALL, WATER TASTE REASONABLY GOOD, BEST OF ALL THE PRICE FROM DEALYARD IS ABOUT MORE THAN 2/3 LESS FOR THE SAME PRODUCT. THANKS.WILL DEFINATELY USE YOU AGAIN. DAN."
4,Great water filter...,"Fantastic deal for those looking for a ""non-plastic"" beautiful water filtration system for your kitchen. My wife loved the price and the finished product. Only thing, be sure that your fittings match up before you begin install. My home was built in the mid 80's and I had to change some of the fittings to match up to the standard ones provided. Newer homes probably won't have this challenge. But, check to be sure. A+ item. Will purchase from DealYard again. Fast shipping."
5,"quiet, beautiful film","A loud, careless seven-year old city boy is left with his ancient country grandmother for several weeks while his mother looks for work in Seoul. This story is the slow developing of a relationship between the two, as the woman takes any abuse the boy gives with quiet patience and the boy gradually comes to respect and even love her.The shots are quite beautiful, with visuals often communicating as much as the words, and the setting in the countryside of South Korea is lovely.I thoroughly enjoyed the film as well as learning a bit about the country. DVD extras are non-existent. The film can be heard in Korean with optional English subtitles."
5,If anyone like Hemingway's style!,"""My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.""--Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)That's how I remembered this movie!Touching and poignant love story!!"
2,WAY Overrated on Here,"No way should this movie have a 5 star rating, its not that good. The movie isn't even 90 minutes long but still feels like a drag, it is BOOOOORING. The story is just too simple, it could have been told in a 30 min to 1 hour show and not lost anything. Also, the kid in the movie is just too bratty and annoying that once he suddenly changes his tone you just feel like yeah sure, whatever...unless you're a guillable sentimental type. If you wanna see a good Korean movie go for Oldboy (or any of the Vengeance Trilogy), A Tale of 2 Sisters, My Sassy Girl, Save the Green Planet, Tae Guk Gi...leave The Way Home on the shelf."
4,"good korean movie, kind of sad and kind of sweet","I purchased two copies, one as a gift. This is a nice little story of a grandmother living in the country in old fashioned style and her city grown grandson who is tied to video games, tv and all the stimuli of today. When he's stuck in the country with a mute grandmother, the conflicts are apparent but the consistent care of his grandmother eventually rubs off, making this a bitter sweet movie at the end. Won many awards in film, highly recommended for the great price."
4,A GREAT SUBTITLED FILM FOR PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUBTITLES,"WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE. THIS IS A HEART WARMING STORY THAT IS SIMPLE AND SWEET. SPOILED ROTTEN BUT UNHAPPY YOUNG CITY BOY IS TAKEN TO LIVE WITH GRANDMA WHO LIVES IN A VILLAGE IN A HUT. HE IS, OFCOURSE, HORRIFIED AND MEAN TO THE OLD LADY. THE GRANDMA IS VERY PATIENT AND REMINDS ME OF ""THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD"" SHE JUST KEEPS ON CHUGGING UP THE HILL OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP.SINCE THE GRANDMOTHER IS A MUTE, THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH DIALOG. MY FIRST GRADER WATCHED WITH ME AND HE READ PART OF IT AND HAD NO PROBLEM KEEPING UP WITH THE STORY. I NEVER THOUGHT A NEEDLE AND THREAD COULD MAKE ME CRY."
4,"Not exciting, something better....","88 minutes of tranquil commune with a lifestyle unlike the big city. A front row seat to the evolution of gratitude and compassion in a self-centered child. The enduring, unflappable love of a grandmother. A good cast. Photography par excellence. This movie won't jumpstart your battery, but it will heal your frazzled nerves. I only wish we could purchase the soundtrack of the simply eloquent piano music!"
4,"Even though I'm not part of the EU, I found this useful and entertaining",I found myself chuckling out loud throughout the entire book. A lot of tongue in cheek and typical Brit humor interspersed with a lot of actual usable implementable ideas. Well done.
4,"Fun, clever, useful!","Very good tongue-in-cheek advice for the mainly young and hip. Wish I had read this forty years ago, but parts still useful at my advanced age. The Brits still know how to write clever prose. The spirit of Evelyn Waugh iw not dead"
2,For British audiences,"Just not anything new, except something about how to scam UK welfare, as best I can tell. Pretty boring. Not one ""brillant"" idea."
2,No good,"Waste of time, everyone knows all of this already. Use your own common sense And use your time more wisely"
2,Get it Free,"There is nothing really new, revolutionary, or awe inspiring in this book. I got it free on KindleFire. I wasn't worth what I paid. I dumped it after reading two chapters and skimming the rest. Don't waste your time."
3,Could have done better,"I admit I spent also only one day reading it, but I was more disappointed than pleased. She is not up to her best in this romance. It is all too clear what will happen and the woman who tells the story is far too outragouse a person to mark any scores with avid K readers. I know this is rather harsh for someone who really like to read Kallmaker, but I thought this one was a let down. Let's hope for her next romance."
4,Great Aussie Pub Music,"This cd contains great songs from the opening of some people which is a top song to reckless and slave.l have always been a huge fan and being Australian myself it's a must for your collection .l would recommend this to anyone who likes other Australian artists such as Shannon Noll,Jimmy Barnes,lan Moss or even Byran Adams"
1,Forget this one,"I have owned this phone system for 2 years, and I'm currently shopping for another to replace it. For the money, it should've lasted me much longer. The problem is with the buttons. They simply don't work. For the last year, we have been able to take calls, but many of the buttons don't work so we have to grab the cell phones to make a call."
1,This is not a soundtrack.,"How can this soundtrack album not have the incredible title music? Why does it have sounds of a car engine running in the background at one point? Like another reviewer said, I bought this to capture the haunting Neil Young music. It is not here. Boo. Hiss."
1,What's with the surf sound effects,Great movie. Petty this sound track isn't from it - rather a self indulgent play around in the studio. The guy was no where near the sea until the last scene so why is there sea shore sound effects on EVERY track. Ruined what could be a great albulm. Buy the DVD instead and rip the music from there.
3,"5 Star Soundtrack, 3 Star CD","I bought this wanting to re-experience the hypnotic guitar music of Dead Man. What is the trend lately with companies adding dialogue from the film onto soundtracks? Oh well, I can deal with that in this instance because the dialogue to Dead Man sufficiently blends with the resonating guitar, but what's the deal with the background noises? On the copy I got the feeling somebody had mastered the album with two boom boxes in their Dad's garage. There is the distinct sound of a motorcycle being gunned and several points in the album...weird. Thankfully the guitar is usually loud enough to overwhelm this.Also, as pointed out elsewhere, that great methodic opening and closing theme is absent. Too bad. Young comes off in regards to this movie like a modern day Ennio Morricone - puncutating key moments in the film with discordant strikings of his guitar. This really is a fantastic soundtrack - but again, as said elsewhere, don't buy it without seeing the movie first."
2,what a waste,"I love Dead Man and I love the musical score, but this CD is hardly representative of the actual music from the actual film. The instrumental from the opening credit sequence of the movie was the highlight of Neil Young's score, but it's NOT HERE. Also, there was no poetry readings by Johnny Depp in the film, but there are on this so called ""SOUNDTRACK"". And what's with the idling truck engine and slamming car doors in the background? There were no motor vehicles in the film. If you're looking for the music from DEAD MAN, you just have to watch the film, you won't find it here."
3,A Great Soundtrack Remixed by Cretins,"It's always a mistake to overlap dialogue from a film with the soundtrack, if you must do it, put the dialogue on seperate tracks so we can skip over it. The most glaring and horrible mistake was placing the sound of car engines and highways over Neil Youngs amazing, raw score. Where William Blake and Nobody are having their adventures will soon be highways and cars. YEAH WE GET IT, AND THANKS FOR RUINING THE SCORE WITH YOUR HEAVY HANDED ARTISTIC SENSIBILITIES. Another pisser, the absolutely wonderful title intro wasn't even included!?!"
2,Where's the music,"As many have said, without this soundtrack the movie was another also ran. But without the movie this soundtrack - isn't! Where's the music that made the movie so great? It ain't on this CD."
2,"Disappointing ""sound track""","The film Dead Man, is an interesting and sometimes hauntingly absurd film..verging on the philosophical, but without the music by Neil Young, it probably wouldn't be so successful. On the other hand, the music without the images is weak and not freestanding as it's recorded in this so called ""sound track"" CD. Even though Neil Young's expressionistic guitar playing from the film, still resonates as a powerful ""image"" in my memory, the CD falls way WAY short of the actual filmatic material. The film, as it is, with both image and sound IS almost perfect, almost great."
2,"Nice work, if you can get it....","Yeah, the music fits the film like a glove, and so I guess it succeeds on that level. But, really, this is Neil Noodling for 60 minutes while a film about nothing essentially rolls on to the end.Imagine Jean Georges Vongerichten making potato latkes in Detroit. What a waste.Nothing else to say about it really. Nice job scoring a paycheck for this. ""Philadelphia"" it aint."
1,Save your money,"I seldom write reviews so that should tell you something right off. I'm a big time Neil Young fan which explains why I bought this CD. So what's this cd like. Imagine you're in a room and someone is tuning their electric guitar. They may connect a few notes here and there. They might strum a few chords on occasion. But you're waiting for the music to begin. Then imagine someone sits down center stage and reads from a book. If you can imagine just this, you already know what this cd is like. Other than a reasonably nice selection in the middle of the cd, there is nothing music worthy on this cd and that one selection isn't worth your spending your hard earned money. So who should buy this CD? Well if you're into getting high and letting the music play in the background, go for it. If you're a Neil Young fanatic, like I am, and want to have every CD he ever made, yes buy it (but you don't have to listen to it). Otherwise, spend your money on Zuma or one of his other CDs."
1,A load of rubbish from a great man !,"O come on ! He's been given a thumbs up just because he's The Neil Young ? It's just simply boring and un-inspiring. Imagine the same exact score written/played by an unknown for a B-grade sci-fi flick, you'd think anyone cared ? No, right ? So do I. Period !P.S - I had wanted to give a zero rating, but 1 is the minimum, hmmphh !"
5,Excellent,"Great creative effort by Neil. However, I recommend you see the movie first and it will make more sense to you. Deserves more credit than it gets."
5,San Frantastic!,"Being an enormous fan of Dead Man, heavily due to the music of the film, and heavily due to the fact that it's Jim Jarmusch, and heavily due to the fact that it has Johnny Depp, and heavily because this film is unbelievably great, this was the best thing I could ever get.If you enjoy the music of the film for the right reasons, you will absolutely enjoy this album as I have."
4,Good stuff,"Not everything I wanted, but it's still some awesome work from Neil. If you're a true fan you'll dig it."
5,"Stark, intense... perfect soundtrack for the movie","I too am not a huge Neil Young fan - I have maybe 2 other Neil Young cds. But having seen the movie, the music conjurs up such powerful landscapes that it always moves me. On a par with the Paris, Texas sound track by Ry Cooder."
1,Irrrrritating!!,"This is a true story. Some years ago there was an abstract painting in a London Museum. Nobody would understand anything, but they agreed to the fact it was a great piece of art. Nobody would recognize it was meaningless junk. Until one TRUE expert visited the museum, watched it, and said that the painting had been all that time...UPSIDE DOWN!! Which means that everysingle one before this expert were either liyers or plain paranoid. This cd is like that painting. A piece of ****, and if somedody gives it 5 stars (5 stars!!!), beware!! Insane in the brain!!"
1,Disappointed with Color,"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. MY STONE IS NOT BLUE AND BRIGHT PINK AS PICTURED, BUT MORE LIKE BLACK AND ROSE-COLORED PINK. I WISH I HADN'T ACCIDENTALLY THROWN OUT THE PACKAGING, OR I WOULD RETURN IT. THAT SAID, IT CAME QUICKLY AND WAS PACKAGED NICELY."
2,"pink rhodonite, peridot and amethyst pendant","I know it said it would probably differ slightly from the picture, but the color seems more on the flat side to me. The main stones cut also seems a little sloppy(but I am a perfectionst!) Either way, it's not bad for the price... and I will still be giving it as a gift along with a few other things. Mabey it doesnt seem so great because I ordered the teardrop moonstone pendant along with it and THAT is really nice!"
5,Acer CDRW -4432AI 32x4x4x Internal IDE drive,"Installation is a snap! Fantastic for the price. Making Music Cd can be tiring for the beginner, but not a problem for the experienced. The problem is choosing and matching the CD size to original - not the drive fault. I easily upgrade the firmware from 3CS to 3DS! This is my 2nd CDRW and it even use the old EasyCrPro prog from my old Wearnes CDRW 2x write. Makes an 74 min audio CD in 15 min or so. It is not a hot drive! Great burning - well recommended."
5,"Quick, Efficient & Unbelievably priced&#65533;","These would probably the best words to describe this new toy, which I've picked up.... It comes bundled with Adaptec software, which with its wizard friendly software can make you an expert on how to burn CD's in no time. Though it's not a SCSI card based drive, it's price and performance will make your woes dissappear in a whisper......"
1,over-rated,"first, The sound production on this album is terrible... the musical performance as well as the vocals are poor.second, and more importantly than first, the 3rd track, ""lamma bada"", is stolen from an old arabic piece and is not credited (claimed to have been composed by Fain Duenas). for all i know this whole thing could be a forgery. no offense to anyone's opinion: this is the most disappointing album i've bought in years."
5,Very Special Music,"I am not generally a fan of this kind of music. But a friend of mine and I were driving to lunch one day and he had it on in his car. I was moved. I bought this CD that afternoon and have been playing it non-stop ever since. Rarely do I ever get such a feeling about a CD. When I put it on, it makes me feel like dancing with my wife forever. I can think of no higher compliment or praise for music."
4,"Flamenco, Arabian melodies and medieval influence","I'll write this review in Italian, because in my country this kind of music is unknown: I Radio Tarifa sono dei musicisti che hanno fatto del legame con la propria terra il loro senso di identità.Tarifa, quella parte della Andalusia che segna il punto più meridionale della Spagna e forse dell'Europa intera, terra di dominazioni arabe, che guarda l'Africa ad occhio nudo. In questa terra i Radio Tarifa hanno costruito, o meglio portato alla luce, il loro sentimento ""meticcio"", e da questo impasto sono nati suoni, ma anche odori, colori e sensazioni di rivendicazione di una terra mai rivendicata dai nativi. ""Rumba Argelina"" è un disco vero, è un vento caldo e inquieto, tutto da ascoltare ed assaporare."
5,A Great Study,"I found this study to be exciting and also very convicting. If one is seeking revival, study this material. I highly recommend it."
5,Seeking Him Bible Study Review,"This is an incredible Bible Study on personal revival. Over 70 women in our church are involved in this study. If you want lasting lifechange, this study is for you. This study is heart surgery."
5,Excellent & very encouraging,"If you are looking for an encouraging and honest Bible-based study tool, this study is excellent. Lay bare before God and search your soul to see if you are in the faith and walking in harmony with God and the Savior Jesus Christ. Great for group or private study."
4,Seeking Him,This was is great shape! I just thought I was ordering a book...not a workbook. My mistake.
1,Only condemnation!,"As the leader of a small group, this study was one of the toughest to facilitate. The women assigned to my group perservered to the end but decidely believed this was, at times, condemning and without hope. It was extremely legalistic and the checklists did not show us anything but failure. Of course, we need to look at ourselves and where we need work but the list never led us to the hope in Christ and how we can be healed and whole because he gave his life for us! The stories were unrealistic and the family's responses were even more unrealistic. The chapter on sexual abuse was so difficult for some of us as she asked those abused to go to their abusers to forgive them for the negative feelings they had toward them. Really? When you feel in your spirit that the study is not of our Lord, we should stop it! I'm sure this author had good intentions but there was NO revival in our groups of over 70 people!"
3,Please Add Page Numbers!,"I'm am going through this study with my church. I bought the Kindle version b/c I love consolidating my bookshelves to my kindle, and the book is a little cheaper. I would give the study more stars, BUT I'm at a disadvantage because of the LACK OF PAGE NUMBERS. Location numbers are not enough to facilitate me keeping up with the rest of my bible study group (who all use paper copies). Some of the homework questions refer to specific page numbers...it's cumbersome sometimes to flip back and find the text the question relates to...I would be greatly blessed to have page numbers.Few of my CHRISTIAN kindle publications include page numbers. Most of my professional and more secular pubs do. They are a great benefit to commenting on and conversing about with others.PLEASE ADD PAGE NUMBERS!!!Thanks for reading :)"
4,Your music for a lazy Sunday.,"This disc is great to put on if you are going through a lazy4 hours of relative inactivity.Mainly an hour of new age-gooving-slow beat ehh if there is such thing .This is very pleasant,so just press repeat and you are set.Easy does it."
3,It was a'right,"Kamoj Quanta Argali is the 18 yr old governor of a planet of former slaves. When a newcomer on the world Havyrl arrives to recover from an ordeal which left him half mad, he spies Kamoj taking a bath in a river and falls for her. Impulsively Havryl offers to marry her which causes strife and conflict throughout the region, as Kamoj's spurned fiancee vows revenge.I looked forward to this novel, but I admit I didn't care for Havryl. The drunken binges, the whining, and his 'tragic past' was a bit overdone. The relationship between Kamoj 18 year old (I don't care how biologically mature) and the Havryl 64 year old guy skeeved me out. I just don't like huge age differences between my romantic couples. At one point Havryl is talking about being a grandpa and described as being a hot-looking 40. Umm.. No.There isn't much sci-fi in this one except for the revelations about Kamoj's people. I felt this was an okay book, which could've been better.3 stars."
2,A Surprising Choice For A Nebula Award,"I bought this book because I had heard it won a Nebula award, but I should have been forwarned by the blurbs that were not from SF sources but rather from the Romance Novel set. This book had a number of major problems. 1) There are a number of major plot holes. The heroine make sacrifices becuase of the love of her country (of which she is queen) but the country and her knowledge of it are hardly developed at all. 2) I had a few laughs over the names of the 2 males in the triangle. Vyrl and Jax. Hmmm... 3) The naming of other characters after quantum states and terms in physics as also a bit of a stretch. 4)The central section of the book is tedious in the extreme, and I thought not terribly coherent or entertaining. Ultimately co-dependent pathologic relationships are a downer. In short if you are a SF fan that likes a logical story and interesting ideas, you may not find this the book for you."
2,Tedious: I couldn't finish,"Like other reviewers, I got this because of the Nebula Award. I guess it was a bad year for ""science fiction,"" because this is a pretty bad book.There is a chance the plot becomes interesting after the first 150 pages or so, but the writing is so bad that I could not be bothered to find out. The writing is bad on many levels: the prose is wooden and contains many mistakes (such as poorly placed adverbs and the like); the characters are simply Harlequin Romance characters (though not with their depth) at a costume party; the ""world building"" is like a pre-teen's attempt at a hero comic book; and the dialogue unfailingly unrealistic.With so many other worthy books around (e.g.,The Sparrow, which I finished just before I picked this up), I cannot think of a single reason to recommend this book.I only gave it two stars because it was not (at least so far as I read) offensive."
4,Not up to Ms. Asaro's usual standards.,"I was somewhat disappointed in Ms. Asaro's ""The Quantum Rose"". I can't quite put my finger on it, but the story never really captured my attention as her previous novels have. I understood why, but I got very tired of the submissiveness of the heroine."
2,My least favorite Asaro novel...,"I have become a Skolian junkie and was very excited to get this book since it was one that won some awards and was highly touted in the series. When I read it, I found this one to be way more insipid romance novel than the other books in the series. I like the dynamic she usually finds between the sci-fi and romance. This was beyond bad in terms of plot and dialog. This was a painfully cheesy read and really disappointing. I am glad it was not the first one I picked up or I would not have bothered with any of the other books."
4,Fascinating series,"I stumbled into the series with this book and was very pleasantly surprised by the author's thoughtful attention to detail and plot. Next I read Primary Inversion, which was excellent. I'm planning to read the rest as fast as I can find them.Don't be put off by the R-word other reviewers have bandied about. It seems women who write SF about women who have men in their lives are tarred with the romance keyword, but there is nothing formulaic or bodice ripping about Asaro's women or their stories. This is space opera and it's a lot of fun to read."
2,"Lots Of sleeping, Lots Of Drinking, Not Much Quality Writing","I ordered this book and suffered through it because it won the Nebula Award. If you enjoy good writing, in-depth characters, fascinating Science Fiction or Fantasy worlds I feel certain this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you like a fast read romance loaded with cliches you may like this book. Never again will I assume a book is at the top of its genre because it is a Nebula winner."
2,Soap opera hogwash,"I knew from looking at the book's cover that I could be in trouble, but I still had hope. This can't be classified as science fiction, but rather as only childish fantasy. To think of Isaac Asimov in comparison... I'm sorry, but the book was not even at the juvenile level in terms of story content, philosophy, or ideas about what wonders other worlds and times might hold. I would never purchase another book by this author."
4,A great story of how envirornment doesn't determine life,"I really enjoyed reading this story and was moved by how Mr. Kahn overcame an environment that should have left him a looser. His stories about the carny life are both funny and enlightening. This book would be a great read for anyone, and especially for someone who is curious about the circus."
5,A Necessary Read!,"Wow...where to begin...This book used to be on a required reading list for teens, and I have NO IDEA why it no longer is...This book is a necessary read-I don't care WHO you are! I picked it up in a waiting room and was entranced from the first paragraph. An amazing read for young teens with a history of rough childhoods...heck...a MUST read for anyone who has had ""it rough""...BEYOND inspiring...I've recommended it to dozens of people and have gotten so many responses on how this book helped them cope. Please read this book. And PLEASE pass it on...I bough 9 copies of it and have given 7 away...I keep a copy to lend out :)The other 7 copies have been enjoyed, treasured, and passed on for others to benefit. Unfortunately, I believe this book is out of print...but maybe if enough are sold, they'll start up again!Enjoy and pass on! I would give this 6 stars if I could!"
5,Nasty and Rockin,This has got to be one of the greatest classic Two Live Crew CD's. A must own for fans. Not a CD to play when your grandma is over! ;-)
5,great product/price/ship time,"The transformer on my TACO circulator control blew and this was a replacement action instead of buying a whole new control. cut the old one out, wire nut the connections and viola--good as new"
1,Piculiar transformer!!,"This transfer is piculiar! For sure it is defective. When applying 120 v to the primary, it blows the 8 Amp fuse at the primary, and provide a piculiar hum sound.The primary and secondary coils pass continuity test. The DC resistance of the primary and secondary coils is about 2 ohms. It appears that the primary coil is partially shorted!!I bought another transformer from a local retail, the DC resistance of the primary is about 21 Ohm!!!, the secondary is about 2 Ohms. When 120 volt is applied, fuse does not blow, and no hum sound. This is the NORMAL transformer!"
1,REFUTED! By its own author nonetheless!!!,"For all of you out there who have relied on ""Babylon Mystery Religion"" as your source to discredit the Catholic Church, first of all - shame on you!!! Secondly, perhaps you ought to know that the author, Ralph Woodrow, has written a follow-up book to this tabloid called ""The Babylon Connection?"". In his follow-up work, he discredits and refutes ""Babylon Mystery Religion"" by acknowledging his relative inmaturity at the time and his reliance on a very unreliable source.Congratulations to him for prayerfully examining his flawed position. Works like ""Babylon Mystery Religion"" and ""Roman Catholicism"" by Loraine Boettner are prime examples of conjecture and shoddy journalism at its worst and bearing false witness at its best.You can read his own words on this matter at the webpage for his latest, and revised, book. Try this URL:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0916938174/qid=924546894/sr=1-1/002-4924141-1247834Thanks Ralph!"
5,A must read for those who desire to know the truth,"If you love God's Word you will embrace this book. It exposes the whore, the mother of harlots as found in Rev. Chap.17 & 18. As an ex-catholic it unmasks secret church history never taught in catechism. It reveals the massive genocide of the inquisitions long since removed from history books and the public libraries. The author under ecclesiastical pressure has refuted his own book which is odd indeed (though not in light of church history) regardless, the extensive footnotes speak for themselves. His follow-up book proves nothing so judge for yourselves and don't listen to those who would keep you in ignorance. And as for Karl Keating's opinion he is a known catholic apologist with the obvious bias. Ask around your church circle if anyone could lone you their copy. Be a good Berean, and search the scriptures. Don't forget to return it. ""...the truth will make you free"""
1,Don't be duped! Read more by him,"This book seems quite shocking at first - until you find out that Ralph Woodrow recognized that the book/author (The Two Babylons/Alexander Hislop) that he based his 'research' on was faulty and the conclusions that he derived from this poor historian was even more faulty. So he took the time to prayerfully do REAL research himself and look into the topic.I'm glad he did. And he refuted what he wrote in this book w/ his new book ""The Babylon Connection?"".This book was an interesting read in that it holds the common misconceptions that non-Catholics have against the Catholic Church. Sometimes people believe what they want to believe."
1,Wow! The Author repudiates his own book!,"I've never laughed so hard in my whole life.It's pretty funny to see all these folks praising the book and telling us how full of ""truth"" it is, when the Author *himself* says that he was wrong, and that he has taken the book out of circulation, because it is historically false and full of untruths.He has written a _new_ book, called the ""Babylon Connection"", in which he retracts everything he wrote in this book (""Babylon Mystery Religion"").Unbelievable!"
4,"Excellent, The Book is factual and true, a must read!","Babylon Mystery Religion is a book for anyone considering becoming Roman Catholic or who is Roman Catholic and sometimes questions the church traditions. If you read this book, you will have serious questions for your priest."
4,My girls are just like the girls in the book,"This book may not be that eloquent in describing twins, but it certainly tells it like it is! It reminds me of my twin girls. I have a neat freak and a slobber monster. One HAS to do everything right and one is in another world. I like this book even though it uses the word ""hate."" It's just too strong a word for the sibling rivalry that is overcome by an unshakable sense of sisterhood."
5,Wonderful series!,"I really din't need to say more about this series, charming talented Miss Angela Lansbury makes my late nights really relaxing and enjoyable!"
4,Great mysteries,"Just love the series. I watched the whole season in a weekend. I wish that there were extras...bloopers, cast interviews, things like that."
2,average,"I have had this unit for 4 years. It has good sound for a bedroom unit. Music and dvd sound good. The motor runs loud, the dvd changer is loud, the thing now freezes up when I try to turn it off. The dvd changer functions are slow. All in all, it is worth the money just for the sound alone as the speakers are good. However if you got the money, get a better unit."
1,U do get what you PAY for... this is junk,Don't waste your time or money on this system. I have had two of them in 2 years and I am looking for a new system. Quality is just not there!!!! System screeches and grinds shortly after you have it. DVD/CDs get stuck and stop working. And let's not forget that it run extremely HOT.....Simply not worth your time or effort.
2,Quick Pro's and Cons,"Pro's----------Delivers a pretty good suround sound effect for the price.-Holds 5 CD's of any type (not mini cd's)-Modern look, and slim design-Easy to set up-HDMI-USB hook up-Easy to change speaker settings during playback.-----------Cons------------Minor hiss sound when on but not when playing media.-CD/DVD deck is a little noisy when playing or switching.-Difficult to use controller to switch CD/DVD's-Turning off the device sometimes makes a static sound.-USB Media Bridge is a little slow.-No sound output (like to TV)------------------Personal expiriance with product=Hooked up to a LG 42 Inch LCD TV.The HDMI port does not work on mine.Though HDMI is useless because the port is for video only.You cannot use your tv speakers with this device.Overall it's an ok system, but I would get something else."
2,What a terrible system,I tried my best to keep this item but it was terrible. There was hardware missing and the system was buggy. Sometimes the sound modes would act differently than described and the speakers had a crackling effect in Dolby mode. I contacted RCA for the missing parts and they advised they could not and that I would have to send the entire system back to them on my own dime. At that point I threw in the tolwel and returned it.Take care
1,DOA,"The system arrived with a non-functional 5-disc DVD tray. Called the manufacturer who initially wanted me to pay shipping to send it back for repair. Finally the agreed to send me a return shipping label.Still waiting on return of a ""good"" unit."
1,Rated a 1 star only because there was no 0 rating,"piece of junk. Run as fast as you can from this product. Straight out of the box, dvd disc changer sounded as if it was about to take off into outer space. No disc would even open to insert a dvd. Called Thompson customer support and they actually told me to unplug it for thirty minutes. Being in the electrical field, I knew this was from someone who had no idea at customer service on how to fix this. Powering down only resets logic based circuits not mechanical grinding of gears. Run Run Run!"
5,Love them!,"I loved these the moment I put them on. I was worried that they would be too wide, since I require a narrow width, but they are fine. The heel is high, but the angle of the shoe makes them not seem that high, they are easy to walk in. They look great with jeans."
3,narrow shoe,"Only size 9.5M remain..which is my size was 9W. The shoe too small in width. tight instep, but I like The shoes are so cute! and nice price, too! I decided to keep it."
5,How does Ferret keep doing it?,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Ferret Records continues to amaze me with the new bands they sign. Ligeia is case in point, very reminiscent of old Poison the well. Yeah, you can definitely tell this band counts that older band as in influence. Lyrical topics are pretty much the same, nothing new there, but the vocals completely floored me, as well as the music, which is melodic but heavy at the same time."
2,??????,"I'm confusified by this ""tribute"". They left out some key songs. That kinda annoyed me. Did they put ""No Good Deed"" in it?"
4,"The Contemplative Life, Giants and Selections (Philo of Alexandria)",Very good book with an informative format. I look forward to purchasing other books in this series on western spirituality. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the journey of mankind.
5,monroe and murray travel in bus stop,"marilyn really struts her stuff when she has the right genre, and comedy was it.Her love scenes with Murray show that a kiss can be a real show stopper. The casting is perfect,the mood is sublime and I hated it to end. {everytime I watched it.}"
5,My mom loves this,"My mom, Carol loves this video. Carol: I have searched every for this. So I decided to look here and I found it. I'm going to buy it if I find it for video. I love this movies, especially the story and Marilyn Monroe. I'm gald I finally found it. It is definetly an 11! And I'm so happy to be the first to review this movie. It's one that will not be forgotten!"
2,Difficult to program,"I found this to be difficult to program. It seems that you have to be a ""rocket scientist"" to do so. I purchased another similar radio instead and it is much easier to program."
2,very disappointing but the dogs are still cute,"I was hoping that this book would be on a par with Wegman's clever Weimaraner photos such as we see on calendars. It was not. The costumes were overpowering and I could barely discern the sad Weimaraner faces amid all the pomp and frippery. On a positive note, the puppies hitched to the pumpkin were adorable."
3,starts strong but loses interest,"""Poor Georgie"" is probably the best cut of the entire year of 1991. First six tracks are really strong but the album kinda peters out for the remainder."
2,CRUSHED,The jewel case was totally smashed--why pay for shipping & handling for a piece of junk? This not my usual experience when I buy from AMAZON.
3,pretty good,MC Lyte is one of the baddest Rappers of all time period.she has her own style.on this disc some things work&some don't.but Lyte can rock any style.she Commands Respect.
4,Can't wait to go!,"Frommer's Colorado (Frommer's Complete)This is a good book for anyone interested in visiting Colorado. Every page, i was thinking we need to go there, oh, oh, we need to go there too. I wish it had had a bit more about the scenic wonders and drives and good camping areas."
2,Like reading the dictionary,No pictures at ALL! I'm a visual person and I at least expected some landscape shots and hotel pics... NOTHING! Real Bummer!
3,An Interesting Approach,"Golay writes a double biography: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain's and Edward Porter Alexander's. Chamberlain has long been credited with fighting the most significant action at Gettysburg; Alexander rises through the ranks to become Longstreet's Chief of Artillery. Both men are present at Lee's surrender at Appomattox.This is an interesting approach to Civil War literature as the work simultaneously provides both the Union and Confederate participation in various major battles. Along the way, Golay, a gifted writer, is able to impart a better, more personal understanding of the engagements these two warriors participated in.This is a very worthwhile read."
4,Great for the long haul...,"24 Hours A Day could possibly be the best post-Skynyrd recording in many a while. It takes the feeling and drive of their previous album, and ups the ante both production wise and content wise. Brian Henneman feels more at ease expressing himself, and the band rocks hard. When he sings about being stuck in Indianapolis and that he'll ""puke if that jukebox plays John Cougar one more time"", you feel his pain."
5,A perfect thread from Rocks Rich Tapestry:,"This gem of an album captured CB's at a point in history where it was still an outside place to go to hear music in NYC. In order to listen to this music you had to run the gauntlet of Bums. I don't actually think there was a cover charge: The Shirts classic closer POE and the amazing Tuff Darts :All for the Love of Rock n Roll, thirty three and a third years later these tracks can stand toe to toe with the any rock n roll ever made.Its gritty its raw it's real:Bit of Trivia : the fuzzy image on the cover ARE the Talking Heads but they don't appear on album. Why? Because at the last moment SIRE had signed them to a contract."
3,Nostalgia,"Always enjoyed the stupid humor. Bought it as a gift, and shared it with my children while explaining the elements that go over their heads.-MJ Holmes-Author of ""Tyme And Yon Serpent"""
5,Even funnier than I remembered!!!,"If you are into oldschool funny like I am, then you will fully enjoy Freakazoid. This season in particular even had an episode or two that I had never seen. I laughed and it was good clean laughter. My kids did too. There were a few things I had to explain to my kids because they were too young to know the shows or characters that were being made fun of but it was great non the less. An awesome trip down memory lane."
5,Great introduction to sign carving!,"I purchased this book about 2 years ago and have read it cover to cover about 20 times! There is a lot to digest for a beginner. In any case, I found numerous helpful tips from everything from router set up, techniques. It helped me to learn the science and the art of sign carving. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning how to carve signs. There also are some great videos out there to actually see how the techniques are done. Enjoy! Good investment!"
1,Nothing new...,What a yawner! I expected some useful information about school lunches. All this film does is advise viewers about forming committees and taking action. And the film is not even well made. It really looks like a collage of scenes put together. Skip it.
5,Basis of Western Linguistics,"It is surely out of date, nowdays, but it has been, (from 1816!) one of the basis of Western Linguistics. How do you rate Aristotele's Physics? Five stars for the value of scientific heritage!"
2,Only a historical value,"This book, first published in German first half of the 19th century was THE reference at the time in the world of comparative grammar. It is a huge masterpiece. But readers, attention: this book has only a HISTORICAL value. If you are a HISTORIAN of comparative grammar and wish to study the evolution of the linguistic techniques, then buy it or read it. But the scientific information in this book dating back to the 19th century, unfortunately, are no longer up to date."
2,To be more precise,"I should add that this book is divided into several large tomes, and that - this might catch the attention of beautiful books amateurs - special fonts had been created at the time to type this book, for example unique sanskrit fonts."
5,Great,"great cables. sturdy, built to rock, really heavy duty, ...expect the best from Monster and you wont be disappointed at all."
2,Somebody Help me satisfy my mind,I personally tried to read more into the book because i couldnt get into this book. It seemed as though it was trying to set a point to the readers but for some reason i couldnt enjoy this book.It took my mind to Jamaica then to a cottage. It didnt have a set focus to me.I chose to read this book because it was in Essence magazine's book shelf. But i think they made a bad choice.This was the first book that i read from Colin Channer and i am really not satisfied with this book.I hope someone else can understand this book and tell me the motive behind it.
1,I JUST DIDN'T GET IT,"I read some of the other reviews and was happy to see that someone understood this book.Personally, I just didn't get it. I always try to give a book the benefit of the doubt when it doesn't catch me from the beginning, but this book just didn't do it for me.It seemed as if CC wrote in riddle.As I said before, I am glad that someone else enjoyed this book, because I didn't."
5,AN ATTENTION GRABBER FROM START TO FINISH!!!,"A book that's neither pretentious or Sheakspearean....which makes it totally unpredictable.I couldn't put it down for too long!It touches on matters that everyone old enough to grasp the concept of love, family and religion has had to come to grips with and it's a guide for those that are fascinated only with euphoric feeling that love brings....which in my opinion makes it everbody's reality in SOME WAY.It's a book I know people will love to have in their collection!"
5,A modern day shakespearan read with an African twist.,"This book is alive, I for one cannot decide what about this book holds me captive. The prose runs like poetry, the characters so real one can be forgiven into assuming he listens in on peoples conversations.Most western writers skim over Africa, in their writing it becomes glaringly obvoius they know very little about the continent. They visit, stay in urban areas, mix only with Africans who appear 'westernised' and leave without touching the core that is our motherland.I have always found it ironic that the 'white man' seems more willing to visit villages , sample local dishes, study customs and even take the trouble to study local languages; not so our African-American brothers who visit Africa but miss her true essence.Alex Hailey found our core. And I believe so did Colin Channer."
5,"Satisfied by ""Satisfy My Soul""","Last Summer,I was fortunate to be present at a reading from ""Satisfy My Soul"" by Colin Channer as he prepared to launch this book. I was immediately hooked and the book had not been released yet.With ""Satisfy My Soul"",Mr. Channer proves that he is no one hit wonder.In this, his sophomore effort, he weaves an intricate and delectable tale of love and passion all the while exploring themes of religion, spirituality,friendship and mortality.This stunning book kept me enthralled. I found the characters at once compelling, well realized and believable.I cared about what happened to them.Mr. Channer's real strength lies in his ability to place the reader in the context of the moment. He achieves this through his ability to create uncanny physical descriptions.We also get a real sense of what each character is experiencing and feeling as they evolve with the story.This book will keep you turning each page as you journey with the characters to it's powerful conclusion."
2,HUH?!,"Either I read the book too quickly, or I read a different book than the 21 people who also wrote reviews of this book. I was confused from page 1 and it went downhill from there. I am a great fan of Mr. Channer's first novel, Waiting in Vain, as well as the short story he wrote for the anthology Got To Be Real. However, Satisfy My Soul just didn't do it for me as the previous works did. It took great effort for me not to return the book to Amazon.com for a refund. The love affair between Carey and Frances was too convoluted, as were Carey's attempts to work through his various issues. And as for the Christianity analyses/debates...I was completely lost. The latter part of the book seemed to sum up the entire novel (maybe I should have skipped ahead?), and the ending was pretty wild. I will revisit this book in a few months and see if I feel the same...I probably will."
4,"Real men, real issues","Satisfy My Soul does what few Caribbean novels have attempted. It examines the relationship between strong caring black men, through their love for their women. It depicts complex men who love, envy and admit to their own duplicity. It explores real human emotion outside the box, confronting everyday issues of loyalty, religion, sexuality and surrender. In short, the characters are believable and engaging. The language, poetry. At the very last moment Satisfy My Soul turns, giving the reader a glimpse of what it must mean to be more than human, less than devine."
3,Poetry vs. Controversy,"I truly enjoyed Colin's poetic, lyrical choice of prose and phrases. As always the sensuousness of the characters and of life shines through on every page without disappointment. However, there were times when I felt that pieces of the story were not developed enough. One moment Colin's talking about love and life and without transition he's discussing how to reconcile spiritual disconnectedness and/or beliefs. Overall, I was pleased with what I read, and appreciated Colin's attempt to discuss African spirituality and how those in the Diaspora worship."
2,Disturbing,"Colin Channer has some talent as a writer. What hepossesses none of , is the ability to tell a fluidstory with believable characters and a conceivableplot.Satisfy My Soul is the tale of two warped individualswho find one another. Carey , the book's protagonist ,and Frances , his female companion. Through the courseof the story the reader is taken on a ride throughthe spiritually damaged worlds of these two characters.What unfolds is both pretentious and repugnent.It's been said that Art can either inspire or offendits recipient. The latter sums up my take on thisbook."
2,Whet My Appetite,"I seem to have read a different book than most of Channer's friends. Could it be that my copy had an incorrect cover?Overall, I believe with Satisfy My Soul, Channer's writing and descriptive prose have greatly improved over his last two endeavors. However, he falls waaay short on a storyline that captures one's attention. He has the potential to be a great literary writer. When he evolves, perhaps he'll captivate us with something more cerebral. It did not happen with Satisfy My Soul.I await the day."
2,Interesting... yet a bit of a dissapointment,"Mr. Channer is and will continue to be a great and poetic writer. Having said that, I must however express dissapointment in his latest novel. I was left with the impression that there were actually two books clashing into each other, one about African mysticism and the other about romance and betrayal. Don't misunderstand me, the two topics can definitely go hand and hand. However Mr. channer seems to have trouble blending them and they seemed to be too distinct and disjointed. It was as if he was writing two books and gave up on both of them, then tried to put them together into one book.Mr. Channer is a gifted and lyrical writer and I will continue to look for more work from him, I just think he dropped the ball on this one."
1,lost his soul recently to a tragic loss of friend or relativ,This book was written by someone under stress. The publishers where in a hurry to have a new book by the author. I believe they should have waited or really read the book it has no soul the book is someone trying to finish a term paper without there heart in it. Only a objective mind that do not deal with the real world can find this book interesting.
1,The Last Homecoming,This movie was vulgar and it should have a rating so that people would know what they are viewing. I have my concerns about buying any more Greek movies
1,Avoiding to tell historical truth,"When I read the book from the beginning I realized that the authors main goal is trying to justify the reasons why Azerbaijan should be an autonomous state.Always referring to Persia at that time as Iran, and not mention that Azerbaijan has always being for thousands of year's part of Persia. The facts were misleading, because the author is trying to use its nationalistic point of view in order again to justify the separation of Azerbaijan from Iran.He fails to say that, the Azeri population is well mixed among Iranians. They are very well integrated in society, and they are vital to the function of Iranian society.He ignores all the facts, and fails to bring the future affects of what will happen if Azerbaijan is separated from Iran.I have one comment for my non-Iranian friend, dream on, you can leave Iran and all your Azeri friends can go and live in Turkey, but not even a single inch of Iran will be given to you non-Iranian, hate promoting separatists."
2,Yawn...,"I'm a Retro-chick through and through. This was the most boring book I've purchased on the subject. Very dry. Loads of information, but not a ""fun"" read."
4,Ugly Beautiful Says It All,"There is some very distasteful and disquieting stuff here -- start with the insert cover which may be a toe-tagged corpse, follow that with the blasphemous-to-some Jesus Is My Girlfriend and Bad Shave, and then I Didn't Want to Wake You Up (not that he could have because the object of the song is quite dead, thank you). You get the idea. A couple other cuts miss; Atomic Soda in particular seems endless. I just hit the skip button for them and doing so still leaves eight or nine wonderful pop songs, twisted pop in a couple cases (Candy Girl and You're Gorgeous) but tuneful hooks and singable choruses abound. The CD closes with two wonderful bittersweet love songs, July and Baby Bird, pushing you out of this odd CD with a lingering taste of sweetness and, yes, innocence."
3,"Parts of it are ""Gorgeous""","I'm reviewing this just because I love the song ""You're Gorgeous"" so much!!!! I'm from the US and was listening to a British station one day and heard this fantastic track. It's catchy, fun and even has to story to it if you care to follow. I'd go so far as to say that ""You're Gorgeous"" is one of the best pieces of pop music of the 1990s.The rest of the compact disc fares pretty well. There's some well crafted pop here and some of the gentler numbers really seems to work. Just be prepared, there's only one ""You're Gorgeous"". Tracks to listen to: ""You're Gorgeous"", ""Goodnight"", ""CFC"", ""Candy Girl"", ""July"", ""Dead Bird Sings""."
2,Illustrations often add to a story!,"Many of these 33 stories will be familiar to one steeped in British fairy tales, but some have been forgotten and are printed here again with very satisfactory illustrations. ""The Lambton Worm"" tells how the young heir of Lambton Castle caught a loathly worm which grew and grew through the years until it was the scourge of the whole countryside. When the heir of Lambton Castle returned home from the Crusades, he met the worm in a fearsome battle. Robin Goodfellow and Tom Hickathrift are both characterized for us here."
2,Did not hold up,"I loved the concept of the product but it cracked withen four uses, this product has nothing to do with the seller its the manufacturing of it. Maybe its just the one I got you never know."
4,Good choice,"These cups are very nice. I ordered one for my father this Christmas and he loves it already! My husband had received a few of these similar cups last year and if you don't take them out of the freezer in timely manner, they'll crack, then you have to toss them. I hope this doesn't happen to my Dad's."
2,Doesn't Last,"I ordered this mug for my husband. He is a Brown's fan and he loves freezer mugs. He started using this mug in February and it just broke this evening, at the end of May. A crack appeared down the side of the mug where the handle is. This sure didn't last long. I have one myself, a Bengals mug, and so far so good. I have only had it for a couple of months, but I fear mine will crack also. Maybe we just happened to get a defective mug, regardless, my husband is bummed."
5,Bird-a-Day calendar,This calendar is an excellent learning tool for school age children through adults.
5,will beat you till your black and blue,"this was my first pantera album, and it is by far my favorite. it is so rip-roaring intense. strength beyond strength has got to be the best pantera song ever. im not gonna say any more, just buy this."
4,Driven Further,"This is the kind of record to make any man or women gain the feeling of power. at least that's what it does for me. Dimebag Darrell's guitar playing reaches almost his peak on possibly the band's best recorded performance in their career. very importantly, Phil Anselmo's lyrics and vocals are more intense, insane, and intelligent than ever before. if your looking for something intense, look no further."
4,The panacea for heavy metal,"Heavy metal can quickly turn into a genre that throws senseless punches at society's glum faults, but not Pantera. Far Beyond driven is a sister to earlier classics like ""Reign in Blood"", ""Master of Puppets"", ""Vulgar Display of Power"", and ""Black Sabbath."" Phil Anselmo's [gutsy] metal bark puts the finish on a band ready to win the no mercy challenge. Vinnie Pauls strong double bass kick replies to Darrel's rip n' roar guitar snatches, and Rex's sinister bass lines call to mind Jack from Cream. Songs like ""5 Minutes Alone"" are a sure-fire bomb-shell calling for success. The album ends apropriately with a cover of Sabbath's failure ""Planet Carvan"" and turns it into an unyielding work of musical subsistence."
4,One of the American bands I can listen,Pantera is one of a few american bands I can listen to without getting bored and exhausted.Love the production and boldness.
3,Good but not great,"The first four songs of this release are classic relentless Pantera. Strength Beyond Strength, 5 Minutes Alone, and Becoming are some of Pantera's best work. If this is true then why do I give it only 3 stars? Probably because after the opening 4 songs, I don't find anything else on this album that memorable, with the exception of their cover of Sabbath's Planet Caravan. I can put in Cowboys From Hell and Vulgar Display and listen all of the way threw over and over, however, midway through this album I grow a but tired and generally take it out to listen to something else. It's not that those songs are necessarily bad, just not as memorable as previous Pantera tunes. Of course if your a Pantera fan, this album is well worth buying, but if you don't own any of their albums start with Vulgar Display Of Power and Cowboys From Hell..."
1,Pure trash Metal,"How can anybody give this album 5 stars? This is one of the worst albums I bought in the nineties. The songs are daft, the music is more noise then anything. This is no Testament or Metalicca. Just trash."
2,skipping issues/poor sound,"I have to agree with the other reviewer- I purchased this on Record Store Day, and Side 2 (I'm Broken) is skipping like crazy. Total drag. The sound quality overall is pretty poor for a reissue as well-"
4,"Not there best,but a good cd","I think Cow Boys From Hell is there best cd.But Far Beyond Driven is still kick ***.I would say the best song on this cd is Becoming.Other good songs are I'm Broken,Hard Lines&Sunken Cheeks,and the Black Sabbath cover Planet Caravan.Some songs seemed to be just thrown together,like they tryed to be to heavy.The whole cd sounds like it was rushed.I think this album might of been as good as C.F.H,if they just took there time."
5,This was a #1 album?!!,"Not just the heaviest album to debut at #1, but probably the heaviest album, ever. It's nice when deserving music like this and Radiohead's ""Kid A"" can debut at the top. Like Radiohead, Pantera were pushing the bounds of hard, fast music with this one, and they succeeded admirably. It's hard to imagine that an album can get any heavier than this one, without degenerating into mush. How does Vinnie Paul keep up that double bass onslaught on ""Strength Beyond Strength"" without collapsing. I get worn out just listening to him. Elsewhere, Pantera shows why they are one of the few bands in history who could never be accused of ""selling out."" After I listen to this CD, I always have to put on some nice mellow jazz to come back down from sledgehammer city. The cover picture says it all."
2,Less than stellar,"I have to second the other reviewers' comments regarding the quality of this pressing. For a 180g vinyl, I am far from blown away by the sound quality. I did experience the same skipping at the beginning of I'm Broken as the other reviewer mentioned, but I was able to almost completely alleviate that with some heavy cleaning with my record brush. However, as another reviewer stated, side D (Use My Third Arm, Throes of Rejection, Planet Caravan) is near unlistenable due to the amount of surface noise on the record. How no one realized this before pressing is incredible. Pretty big let down."
5,Why?,"Why Dimebag? (Or any of the other victims for that matter) Why didnt Nathan Gale just blow his freakin useless brains out instead? Right now I sit here in my Pantera shirt staring at my Pantera lunchbox and Im listening to this very album as I type this review. It was this disc that really introduced me to the metal world when I was 13 years old. (Im now 23). You will never find another unique sound as them. From Phil's growls to Dimebag's screeching guitar..this disc has it all. *RIP* Dimebag..my heart goes out to you, your family, and all the fans out there."
1,YAAAAWWWWWNNNNNN.......................,Nothing but a bunch of noise. I can imagine being in a prison and having this blasting out of another convict's stereo. Phil Anselmo seems to be trapped in a prison. He sounds like he is giving birth. Or having a limb amputed. I can imagine other great guitarists other than Dimebag.
1,"Heavy? Yeah right, about as heavy as Ricky Martin.","This is the weakest band I have ever heard.They aren't even heavy. If you want real metal that is very heavy go with Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath. And try Kiss. Also that guy is really stupid that said heavy through his whole review."
1,A Very Fair Review,"omg i hate this album so much. dimebagz drum skills on this sux. and his brother, the singer, rex, are awFul too. it isn't even singing but just a bunch of screaming. an phiL AnselMo cant play guitra if his life depended on it lol. that leaves viniE paul on bass and keyboards and omg why did panteRa introduce kEyboardz in there music. they r starting to sound industrail like stabbing westward did except they alwways sucked lol. and theres only 9 songs on here what a jip. i expect at least 12 and this only has 9. theres also no VarIEty either all the songs sound tha same. do yurself a favor and dont buy this sellout industrial crap.W"
5,metal at its best,when i 1st listened 2 this album i was in high expectations since just purchasing great southern trendkill and i must say this album blew me away the 1s 4 tracks always seem 2 be the best on a pantera album but from start to finish far beyond driven will keep any metal fan wanting more BUY IT!
4,Bloodthirsty but also crafty heavy metal.,"The good thing about Pantera is that it realizes the efficacy of power and weight can easily surpass that of speed and noise. Loud and brutish as Far Beyond Driven is, it's also musical, well constructed, and passionate -- many a speed-metal band would do well to learn from Pantera. Phil Anselmo's vocals are influenced by thrash and punk, but they always keep to the realm of singing, not belching (most thrash-metal singers fall victim to constant, boring yowls); ""Dimebag"" Darrell's riffs are carnivorous and driving, never overplaying to the point of overwhelming the groove and the singer, and the production is crisp and merciless, waves of sound crashing over the listener. And on the Black Sabbath cover ""Planet Caravan"" Anselmo and co. show that they can play as melodically as the next band, a deft showing of versatility that eludes most extreme-metal bands.Far Beyond Driven is deserving of praise and respect, and powerful on terms that are entirely its own."
4,Pantera does it again,This CD is one of my favourites.The first four songs are great especially Becoming.Use your third arm is one of THE BEST METAL SONGS.Other metal bands can hide themselves cos this is the way heavy music should go.PANTERA KICKS SOME SERIOUS BUTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"if it says RHINO RECORDS, DO NOT BUY IT...",as with the DOORS vinyl boxset rhino records has once again proven they might be the most inferior and shady vinyl distributor out there. the sound quality is beyond awful. thank god amazon gives full refunds on defective merchandise. i can only assume rhino employs escaped cons and mental asylum patients and no one else.
3,Mediocre,"The first four songs of this album are really good but after that the songs go downhill and the rest of the album is really boring. The first four songs- ""Strength beyond Strength"", ""Becoming"", ""Five Minutes Alone"", and ""Im broken"" are all great songs. The rest of the album pretty much ... though, in my opinion."
2,this album is ok,"What a dissapointment.....Man, when i first heard this i was like this is really bad, but after hearing it a couple of times it had some cool songs. But still VERY dissapointing, not nearly as good as Vulgar or Trendkill."
3,why?,"I am pretty much in agreement with magicbow on this occasion: I purchased this album somehow believing that the epic style of their first albums had been combined with an introspective grunge format. Where I picked up these opinions is unknown. There are some good songs on this recording, but I could not name them as everything seems to sound the same. Their cover of the Sabbath song was an obvious standout, but it cannot lift this album above the mire. I suppose that with their little habits they couldn't keep up the greatness forever. I don't know if they made an improvement with .....Trendkill, but I didn't care for their latest at all."
1,Sounds Too Much Like A Death Metal Band,"What is this stuff this is not the band that I remember. I saw these guys in 1988 when they released Power Metal and that was one heck of an album. They were way better when Terry Gaze was their frontman though, I Am The Night is still their best album that album had great vocals and excellent guitar playing by Dimebag.I hateted when they decided to get this heavy, the guitar tone sounds way to much like a nu-metal band and the vocals are a disaster, I can't believe this was the same band that recordedPower Metal. Do yourself a favour there are some copiesof Power Metal on Amazon get a copy while you can because they arereally hard to find. I hope Vinnie releases there old albums on cd soon."
2,"I know that May 27th, 1994 still hasn't been resolved","This is the day I first listened to this album. May 27th, 1994 was a day that I was at a crossroads where I made wrong choices, but that's because I thought things would be alright. I know the night before I had a bad night, but then I took a girl I was interested in to breakfast for her birthday, and she kissed me, so I thought everything was fine, but looking back I know now I made some bad choices, and I know I watched ""OLTL"" that day, and Rebecca had rejected Todd, and so I listened to this. I know the first 2 albums were aggressive metal, but here it was starting to be more techno sounding, and it's rather annoying sounding. ""I'm Broken"", and their cover of Sabbath's ""Planet Caravan"" are the only 2 songs that are salvagable here. It also shows that the music scene was changing even as this album debuted at #1 on the charts."
2,Not a book I would reccommend,This book is not biblically based if that is what you are searching for in answering or helping you work through things. It shows different techniques you can use but does not answer the questions you have. I would not reccommend this book. It is not worth the price you pay for it.
4,Expensive but Helpful,I am still in the process of reading this. It is such a hard thing to go through and the author hits on many of the problems we face. She has done a lot of research and doesn't get hung up on the religious aspects of losing a grand child. I wish it had a more reasonable price so I could purchase copies for some of the people I know who could benefit from the book.
5,A Book Perfectly Titled,"Mary Lou Reed writes from the heart to share her personal journey as she navigated the various stages of grief upon the death of her beloved grandson Alex.Ms. Reed's own struggle to balance the deeply seated need to grieve for Alex against the maternal urge to ease the pain of her son--Alex's father--paints the perfect portrait of the double edged grief that is unique to grandparents.As informative as a textbook and as heartwrenching as a fine memoir, Mary Lou Reed's sensitive handling of this difficult topic provides a one of a kind sourcebook for the bereaved grandparent.Bravo Mary Lou!"
4,Easily worth the money,"Exceptionally pleased with the quality of performance from this small unit. For the money, this is top drawer. I would highly recommend this am/fm radio for anyone looking for a quality unit for listening while you move the lawn, etc."
4,I like it,"I like vampire games and although I have not seen a vampire as yet I like this game it is based on the movie so you will see some familiar scenes. So far I am at the part where I am battle skeletons. The only thing I find a little frustrating is that you can't do the 360 turn to look around, other wise in that I like it and enjoying it."
1,how could you give this 5 stars?,worst game ever! I played a demo for it and got killed a bajillion times because of the awful camera. The enemies are very frustrating and Van Helsing moves are awful. I got lost in a very small room because of the camera. Stay far away!
5,What the ... happened to these guys?,"I live in Hamilton Ontario, and picked this Cd up a my local record shop, and quite frankly this album jus' blew me away. I mean with it's tight ryhmes, phat beats, and other musical instrumentsthat were used. Man, sopme good listenin'. Any way I highly recomend this disc if you can find a copy. ..."
3,damn good in concert! hey come on US you know canucks rock!,i caught them by accident at an econoline crush concert and i have got to say that BTK and JOYDROP who both opened were both shining examples of how canucks rock the music scene.....although major influence by the beastie boys is evident i've got to say they had more energy on stage than anyone else i've seen!!!
2,Great glasses - If you can keep them from breaking and falling over,"I purchased four sizes of these very expensive glasses: 3.5 oz, 7, 12, and 21 oz. I love the 3.5; in fact, i love all of them for how cold they keep drinks. the 7 and 12 oz ones we found very nice for white wine as it keeps it so cold. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, these glasses break if you whisper too loud. Not quite that bad, but if you just happen to bump them against another item in the dishwasher, etc, you will find yourself with a broken/useless glass, and at $20 per pop for the big ones, that is rough. Also the big ones are very top heavy, so the slightest nudge knocks them over, which, unless your reflexes are supernatural, will end up costing you some broken ones.It's a shame the durability of the glass and the design couldn't match the quality.jim g"
2,Bodum Povina glasses,These glasses are very attractive to look at but they are too delicate for every day use. I broke one while washing it after just several uses and haven't used the other one since. They will sweat a little bit when holding iced drinks.
1,Received smashed into smithereens,"Much too thin - if you can't put an ice cube in one (that can break the glass), the glass isn't going to sweat anyway. And if I can't stir creamer into my coffee (no spoons allowed), I am not going to use them for hot beverages. Totally cool design, absolutely non-functional for an average person that likes to actually consume beverages from their glasses.If you want to fill a china cabinet with cool looking glasses, buy yourself a case of these - because half of them will be smashed in shipping and you will only end up with half a case anyway - leaving plenty of room for Grandma's china that is also too delicate to ever use."
3,Too $$ for the problems,"My husband loves the glasses....but I don't. I'm just not comfortable even using one. The glasses are tall, lightweight and have a narrow base....an accident waiting to happen. We have had a prior set for a year and have not had one break in dishwasher or when adding ice, but i can see this easily happening. You have to be careful with them and if you knock one over on the counter, it's done. Also, what about a handle...this glass needs one for sure. The only good thing is the glasses really do not sweat....and that's all. I would say $15 would be a fair price."
2,beautiful but broken,"while these glasses are beautiful and seemingly designed with intention, they fail the most basic function - durability. we bought 8 of these glasses. 1 of them arrived broken, and after a few months of seeing them break one by one, we have none left. these are definitely not dishwasher safe, as advertised. i hope the manufacturer improves the design."
1,Expensive and Fragile,"Do not but this size, it will not last 6 months!I purchased the whole range of sizes of the glasses, plus a pitcher and teapot. After one and a half years, most are broken despite careful handling. The smaller sizes, 2oz and 9 oz have stood up better, but almost all of the larger sizes, the pitcher and the teapot are gone. Some broke in the dishwasher without any impact whatsoever, a couple broke from dropping an ice cube in, some from an accidental tap against a plate or another glass.It's a beautiful product and works well at insulating, but they need to switch to a tougher glass formulation. I'm am never buying more, it's a waste of money."
3,great product terrible shipping,"These glasses are great! However, It took three shipments from Amazon to get them all and have none broken. I ordered 8 glasses for a Xmas present. I didn't get the complete set in time. Each time I called I told the customer service person that the glasses weren't wrapped securely and that is why they were breaking. I was totally totally unsatisfied w/ the response any time. One of each set was broken in every package delivery that I received!! Buy with enough time to get reorders if this is for a gift!!!!I have shopped w/ Amazon for years with NO issues whatsoever! I was very surprised."
5,Excellent glasses,"These glasses are an amazing combination of form and function, and pretty much the only ones I use at home during the day now. While they are light, I have found them to be quite sturdy. I'm thoroughly pleased with the glasses."
5,Great for smoothies,"I purchased these glasses for my husband since he makes smoothies every morning. Although they are a bit more than the average glasses, we both really like them. They do not leave any condensation rings! I highly recommended any Bodum glasses. I also purchased the 9 oz. glasses for coffee that I really like as well."
5,Great Product!,"Love the glasses. The first sets were shattered upon arrival but the second batch were fine. We love the no sweat and no temperature feel to the glass. While we put the double old fashioned size in the dishwasher, this taller glass gets hand washed. The Bodum brand was recommended to us. We are happy with our online purchase."
2,Excellent Glass But......,"For the most part, I love these glasses. I just ordered my 2nd set, however, as many other reviews have mentioned. I too, think these glasses are far to delicate. One of the glasses broke by putting an ice cube in. The other one broke by simply falling over. Lastly, my recent order of a set of two glasses, one arrived broken in the box. Very Frustrating!!"
3,Be careful!,"We broke one of these by just dropping a singe ice cube in it. The other one developed condensation between the layers, indicating a leak."
3,very delicate,"Think of this more like a wine galss or crystal. They may say that the borosilicate glass is durable, and yes, it can take the heat and cold, but I managed to crack one of these putting it in the dishwasher- it squeezed up against another glass and cracked the rim.Otherwise it is great, I make hot tea in it all the time and the outside doesn't get hot, and the glass doesn't sweat when you have cold drinks in it. I just wish the glass was a little thicker."
2,Shattered!,"The glasses are marvelous...they DO keep things cold for a long time. And they do keep things hot for a long time.But for pity's sake, be VERY, VERY careful how you put them down or how you wash them. I had the temerity to handwash one and -- in the water, mind you -- it bumped the side of the sink.I had hundreds of shards of this ""glassware"" material.Another one glanced against the spigot as I was rinsing it -- being extra careful mind you -- and it exploded in my hand.Another had the misfortune of another -- REAL -- glass bumping against it in the drying rack. A huge chunk fell out of the side.A HUMONGOUS WASTE OF MONEY, unless you are willing to treat them extremely carefully.NOT for everyday schlubs like me!"
2,"Nice idea, but too fragile to use","The rims are much too thin and delicate and the glass feels too thin to hold with comfort. We received 4 as a gift and after being used a couple of times, all had received chips or pinholes or cracked. The pinhole was undetectable until the glass filled with condensation from the dishwasher. Beautiful but unusable."
1,Fragile! It's a love-hate relationship!,These are the most beautiful but fragile glasses I've ever had. It's like a Lamborghini - high maintenance! They will shatter (and make a big mess) if they get slightly bumped or knocked. Wash them by hand and don't let anyone use them - enjoy them yourself.
2,***BREAK VERY EASILY***,"These glasses do a great job at keeping things cold...HOWEVER...of the 20 that I have purchased, I only have 5 left due to their fragile nature. They are very thin and break so easily that even putting ice into them the wrong way can break the glass. I've had some crack for no apparent reason while they were filled with iced tea and sitting on a counter waiting to be picked up! For that reason alone, I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Beautiful glasses,"I love these glasses, but they are fragile. No matter what liquid you put in the glass, its awesome!"
1,Dangerous...You Could Easily Swallow Glass Shards,Length:: 1:12 MinsThis video shows you why some people consider these glass durable and other don't...and why first hand experience almost had me drinking glass shards.
1,Toooo Fragile for use,DON'T buy these for regular useI started with 4 of the 16 oz glasses....I thought cold beer and hot coffee.....BUT.....the Pavina Bodum glasses are beautiful.....but TOOOOOO fragile for regular use.I crushed one when I held it under my reefrigerator ice dispenser (my bad)the ice pieces punched right through the inner cup.A second just developed a crack and had to be thrown away.....and now a third has a micrscopic leak and fluid is in the in-between space.I am drinking coffee from the one that is left......with only a 1 in 4 survival ratio these are tooooo fragile to use (or buy) I'd give a zero stars if Amazon permitted.Very disappointed !!!
2,Much too delicate,"All of the Bodum glasses work very well at keeping your drink hot or cold, but they are all ridiculously delicate. I don't even remember how I ended up breaking these glasses, but I was very disappointed. They hold a ton of water, but you'll end up being a bull in a china shop with these.Bottom line: Pass on this one."
2,"Received TWICE, in million pieces!","I purchased these glasses, thinking it'd be perfect for iced coffee I make during summer.Received the first package 4 days ago, and I heard the familiar broken glass sound when I lifted the box off the front porch. I saw tiny glass pieces fall out of the corner of the cardboard box, and didn't even have to open it to see whether it was broken. The pieces were literally smaller than 1mm in diameter!I called customer service and they shipped another box (I must say, they are pretty good at that). I received it yesterday and the same familiar sound came when I lifted the box. It wasn't as bad as the first time, but the glasses were in about a hundred pieces.Called the customer service again and was told that they would not be able to send another set, so they promised a refund.Well, I'll have to use my regular glasses for my iced coffee this coming summer. Not the end of the world, I guess."
2,Not worth the money,"I found these glasses to be ""tippy,"" not durable, and hard to fit into the dishwasher. Great concept, but you can find inexpensive plastic ones that will insulate your beverage a lot longer and last a lot longer than these."
1,Good Design Does Not Have To Be Expensive?,"Bought something similar, small crack between the seams where the two walls join after less than a month's use."
3,Beautiful But Too Fragile to Use Regularly,"These glasses are beautiful. I bought them for my boyfriend's birthday because I thought his beer glasses were... not so nice. While definitely an upgrade for him in the aesthetic department, we find them scary to use because they are so fragile. They feel light as though you could break them by holding them too tightly. They don't have that heavy/sturdy feel that you associate with most glass containers. We only hand wash them (no dish washer for these glasses) and mainly use them for nice dinners. I would buy them again though but only smaller glasses with a lower center of gravity."
1,Too delicate,"Both glasses broke within a week of my receiving them. One fell on placemat on dining table and shattered. The other fell on carpeted floor and shattered. I loved the fact they did not sweat, but thedelicate nature of the product has made me decide to seek other brands that might be a little more durable. Lynda, Pensacola, FL"
2,Nice idea gone too far,"These insulated beverage glasses are attractiveand (thermally) functional but the 21-oz iced-tea version carries the idea too far.At this size, both diameter and height make them very easy to knock over. They are fragile and easy to drop. Yes, I did drop one washing it before I had even used it. I'm just waitingfor the other one to have a similar fate.That said, I will probably still try one of thesmaller sizes -- I really do like my soda tostay cold and it does."
4,Does the job,"I really like the large size and the double-wall eliminates most of the condensation I would normally get on the outside of the glass.I also really like how they look.I also purchased the smaller sizes of this brand and found that they have absolutely no condensation forming.As you can tell, I bought them for cold drinks but they work well with hot drinks too."
5,drink longer,these glasses are perfect for keeping drinks colder or warmer and the best part is you don't feel the temperture on the outside nor do you have condensation from the differences between inside and outside tempetures
5,Beautifully subtle and musically inspiring,"Duet line-ups are interestingly one of the less explored areas of the jazz genre. However, after listening to this CD, duets have become my favourite line-up.This is in fact the perfect example of a duet album, wiht wonderful interpretations of some well known jazz standards and popular tunes. I very much disagree with the earlier review, that this album would be better with a full rhythm section, of course if that were to be recorded, it would be very good also. There is nothing empty or lacking about this album; a soft flowing tenor sound which compliments the comping of Brad's piano.Furthermore, this IS a duet album. There is a perfect balance of both players in both acompaniment and feature. They have got the texture and climaxes of this numbers spot on."
5,Frahm and Mehldau are brilliant.,"Wow -- what a combo. Joel Frahm is a brilliant improviser with a tone so solid and substantial you feel like you could snack on it. Brad Mehldau, already super-famous in jazz circles, is in fine form here. Check out ""Mother Nature's Son"" -- it will knock off your proverbial socks.Very highly recommended for traditionalists and modern jazz fans alike."
3,Took awhile to get going but enjoyable,I like the locale and the hot chicks that worked both sides (double agents)...good character development to them. Plot was a bit week and slow on action and travel...but holograms was the new fad then.
4,a band that should have sold records,"This is not the best CD in the world. It is a very solid album, it's fun, and the musicianship is good. Now that you can only get this CD used you can get it cheap, and it is well worth it. It's good solid fun rock/metal. It's not dark, it's really a fun CD to listen to. I met the guitar player (Dirk) when I was promoting my old band, and we talked about Love On Ice. Dirk was a fun guy to be around, and really funny. You will hear that when you listen to this CD. This band would have been successful had they been backed by their label properly. It's too bad that they were never allowed to develop the sound that was on this record. This band could have put out a lot of really good music. Pick this CD up, it's fun first effort, and it shows what could have been."
4,Symphonic version of original SNDTRK,"A symphonic album with orchestrally arranged music based on the soundtracks to the anime movie aired on Fuji TV in 1985, which was based on a comic book. Contains 9 tracks, including ""Australia Koukyoukyoku (Symphony): The First Movement"", ""Yume no Tsubasa (Memory)"", ""Alpenrose no Uta"", and more. Buy it, it's good."
1,Nothing really new,Although I love the title the author seemed to be more of a dealer than the junky I had imagined and recieved his inspiration in an actual prison cell rather than the shackles of addiction. I give the man credit for the education he earned and the career in social service. I also appreciate his criticism of America and drug policy in particular but over and over he spoke as if he had discovered Marxism and could change the world if only someone would listen. Education as escape from poverty a point well made. This book really says quite little about heroin or heresy.
4,One of the few bands who did rap-metal right,"Nu-Metal has become a refuge for bad rappers and worse guitar players. Rhyming words don't make it Rap, and distorted guitars don't make it Metal. 24-7 Spyz was a uniquely talented and innovative band, combining massive doses of hard-rock crunch with stinky funk and clever lyrics. Jimi Hazel is one of the best guitar players you've never heard of. There are only 5 songs on here, but they are all excellent. If you can find any 24-7 Spyz CDs, they are well worth purchasing. This may have been their best lineup."
4,"Well written,fun subject",Deb Levine has made the topic of cybersex easily understood and accesible to the average person. The book was fun to read and has a little bit of info for everyone. You can pick it up on any page and find something useful and insightful.
3,Enjoyable but needed more editing,"I almost put this book aside when the urban New York heroine was speaking in Australian slang. This started the book off on a very rough note for me. I realize that the author is an Aussie but the character was a Yank and should have spoken like a modern American teen.Madeline's mother has met an online boyfriend, so she and her mother need to go to Australia to meet him. Madeline is very resistant to the idea, especially as her vacation gets worse and worse fast.I found Madeline to be excessively immature for her age. This marred what was a very cute and enjoyable story. Her antics and character growth were fun and thought-provoking, but this hasn't been my favorite Smooch release."
5,Parties for Children,I ordered four. However one has a lot of pages missing. I wasn't too happy with that. My own book is from 1964. I bought these for a friend and my grand children. It still works in 2010. Don't know why Betty Crocker hasn't reissued it. I used information in my copy for my granddaughter's tenth birthday party. The children loved the games.
4,Betty Crocker,purchased this cookbook for my Betty Crocker collection since I couldn't find it locally; love the condition it was in and is also a great cookbook!
5,Essential Literature,"Disregard what has been written, in other reviews, about Watt...simply read it, simply continue to read it.Beckett is always and essentially unreadable. But that does not mean we must not read him, that we must not continue to read him.Watt is among his finest works."
5,For the Love of Dusty,"What child has not found an abandoned kitten and hustled it home under a coat with hope in his heart to keep it for his very own? Joseph Baraba's book ""Dusty"" is a story one little boy who finds an abandoned kitten, whom he names Dusty for her beautiful dusty fur and green eyes, and the bond of friendship and love that happens between them. Dusty is a tenacious cat that finds her way back from New Jersey to Vermont in the middle of winter after accidentally being moved with the next door neighbors.It is a tale of love, ""the love of Dusty."""
2,oh my!,"not as good and the first cd, but a darn sight better than the last one, dont say you werent warned!"
5,Musical Magic,"The music selected for this compilation will make you happy, especially if you love the older Disney films as much as I do! You'll sing along with the songs you know, and learn the ones you don't. Enjoy!"
2,So So CD,"I have a 16 month old granddaughter and she is not that excited about this CD. I think it would be great for an older child, there are less familiar songs and certainly not as catchy tunes on this CD. I really bought it because it had the Mickey Mouse Club March on it and I sing that to her all the time. She does enjoy that song!"
1,1st time disappointed,"This is the first time I brought something from amazon that I was disappointed in. This CD was really scratched and was advertised as ""New""."
5,One of the best....,"Disney's masterpieces have always relied on music, so the music has to be memorable and magical. This collection of various Disney tunes (including everything from ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" to ""Mickey Mouse Club March"") is a true gem. If you remember Disney by the early films, your music is here. If you remember the Golden Age (""The Little Mermaid"" through ""Aladdin""), your music is here. If your Disney is the later years (""Pocahantas"" through ""Tarzan""), your music is here. It's all here--even the Main Street Electrical Parade theeme! This album has something for the whole family, and is critical to any Disney music collection! Also reccomended are the other volumes in this series. (So far there have been five editions--this one is the second.) But I especially reccomend this one. ;o) Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection! If you're a Disney fan, you'll never forget this album. (SURE HIT!)"
5,Fantasmically Disney!,"This compillation of many of the best Disney songs such as ""Ev'ry body's got a laughin' place"" in Song of the South, ""When you wish upon a star"" in Pinocchio, ""Supercalifragelisticexpialodocious"" in Julie Andrew's Mary Poppins, ""Mickey Mouse Club March"" from the Mickey Mouse Club are just a few of the amazing songs mixed into this CD. A few weeks ago, my favourite CD of the first 4 was number three, now, it is number 2! So as you can see...they are excellent. I'd also like to point out that if you don't know some songs on the CD's...give them a chance. For example: ""ON The Front Porch"" is a very good song, even if I had never heard it before as well as ""Ev'ry body's got a laughin' place""! Just listen to it and you'll drift away Part of another world or One Jump Ahead of Reality!!!"
5,It's a great read!,I purchased this book to read with my 7 year old and it is written in a very simple way that he loved it. It is always nice to motivate young kids to read and use their imagination. Highly recommend.
3,a good book that could have been great!,"Positives: the authors provide a fairly clear distinction between various types of ""applications"" of movement sequences in kata (bunkai, oyo, henka, and kakushi), as well as strong arguments for the importance of classical (as opposed to sport and performance) kataNegatives: this book needed a really good editor. Poor grammar, typos, unnecessary repetitive passages, descriptions and diagrams that don't match up... all detracted from the message of this book.In summary, there are some wonderful conceptual gems in here, but they are obscured by the flaws. Still an informative book and one I found useful for its concepts, but could have been so much better!"
5,The real Karate-Do,"It is very good to read a book that bring to the light the real Karate-Do. The writer was very happy in reveal the principles and theories about Bunkai. Unfortunatelly today the focus in Karate is almost ever about sport. The true basis of self defense, that is ""written"" in the Karate Katas, is became more and more lost. I recomend it."
3,DISAPPOINTED :(,"I was so excited to find this perticular Bible with the JEAN COVER from when I was young. I ordered it and received one in a black cover, much to my disappointment.After informing the seller that it was the jean cover AS PICTURED, in the add for sale that I wanted, they informed me that they didn't post the photo Amazon did. Which I really doubt. So if ordering from Bank of Books.. DOUBLE check!So once burnt here."
4,Nice and sturdy,"There is no pungent smell with these mats (I noticed some other mats did have reviews about a very bad smell), they look nice and they feel sturdy. They do the job they are intended for."
5,Chevy Bowtie Front Floor Mat,This item shipped promptly and arrived in good order as a gift for the holiday. It was perfect and I appreciated the great service.
4,Functional and easy to get on and off.,"I use these on my regular eye wear. They stay on and are easy enough to get off. My only wish is that they were a little more flexible at the insertion point to make the ""drop"" from the arm piece a little more relaxed."
2,Not a comfortable fit,"Good quality for the price, just didn't like the fit. Odd seam up the back (center) of the leg/buttocks."
4,good,pretty well made. i am going to buy more of them. fit well and feel good. not real thick but feel like good quality.
3,CONTENT & Information ARE GREAT....... the book tore away from binding within the first hour of e reading.,"The book quality is really lacking. I'm sure it will have completely fallen apart by the time I return as the book has come apart from the binding with only an hour of use. Lonely Planet, you know how durable these books need to be!!! OR MAYbe it's Amazon???? Anyway it was defective.CONTENTS HOWEVER ARE MOST HELPFUL AND IT IS WELL WRITTEN."
2,Health and Diet,"The book is very repetitive and would have been much easier to read and follow if the author did not give the same information in practically every chapter. Also, there was some information that is not current with medications now in use for this condition. Even though I found the book too talkative and tedious in its repetitiveness, I believe in the theory behind her thesis: nutrition can make or break our health."
2,Arthritis,This diet is far too difficult for the average. It needs to be summarized for daily eating. Way too over the top.
2,Too Much Fluff,Explained to much about whiy I bought this book. I already knew that. Had to search among testimonials for real food information.Would not recomment this book. Will search for one with more real information and less fluff.
2,Seriously Overated,"This book may have been a breakthrough in its day, 1996, but it's15 years later and the information, although basic and useful, is fundamentally outdated. The book is seriously repetitive, with too many case history's, not enough information on diet, and not enough organized information."
4,Eat it,"I look for many natural alternatives to medications when I can, found this helpful, makes sense food can be medicine/poison."
2,I found this book a waste of time and money.,"I purchased this book in hopes of learning new concrete facts about gout and it's management. I felt the author was less concerned with those of us that suffer from this horrible malady than those with other forms of arthritis. Save your money for a book that will devote at least one chapter exclusively to gout. I really did not learn anything new from this book. If I had picked it up in a bookstore rather than ordering from Amazon.com, I would not have purchased it."
2,Nothing Surprising,"I got this book in hopes that it would tell me something about diet and arthritis. It is mostly about eliminating things from your diet, in order to isolate food alergies.In general, I was unimpressed with this book. Other than advising that you be conscious of food alergies, it is little more than advice on healthy diet. You can get that anywhere without paying $20.""Eat your fruits and veggies."" There. You've read the book."
4,How to Eat Away Artritis,It's a great book if you really want to get better.The book helps you find that relief of arthritis discomfort you need. You just have to be consistent of the food that you eat to get better. Change your eating habits.
1,Rambling bunch of junk,"How many ways are there to tell you how to eat your fruits, vegetables and lean meat. Can not believe I bought it."
1,"Typical of this sort of book, if there is any meat to it, it will be buried in BS","I unfortunately got this rag through the Amazon Mobile app while simply trying to find a book and wound up keeping it and here we go again. It is full of all the reasons to read it and hides (if it is even there) the hand full of pages that may be helpful in all of the background garbage. I removed the app from my smart phone as I don't think it is funny to get an order after simply looking at the product page and hitting the ""back"" button and the darn thing places an order."
3,Good contents but not well laid out,"The book has excellent information on how to eat, how to fast your way to health, etc.It's just a pity that the author didn't get assistance with the layout of the book. I really struggled my way through it and also struggle to find information that I want to refer back to. The layout needs to be a whole lot more systematic and logical."
1,Disappointment,"We opened this product the night before Christmas Eve (luckily). When we went to assemble it, the parts were so crooked we could not put it together. It looked like it could have been cute, but for the price it should have been manufactured better. We had to scramble to find another stroller in time for Christmas. Would definelty not order from this manufacturer again."
3,Good Ole Soulful Margie,"Although Margie recorded this album at the end of her heyday in the mid 70s, it was a decent work. Probably not as good as the album, ""Writing On The Wall"" but still quite a few memorable tunes. My favorite from this album is ""How Will I Know"". The one thing I liked about Margie's album was her ability to have two or more good heartthrob types songs that you could hear over and over. This album only contained two such songs but I grew tired of it quickly. I still wished Margie's career would have skyrocketed the way Anita Baker's career took off. On the other hand, I'm glad that she was never played to death on the airways like some other soulful songstresses. Margie will be be in the Unsung Rhythm & BluesMistresses Hall of Fame like some of her contemporaries: Denise LaSalle, Marlena Shaw, Barbara Mason, Candi Staton, Bettye Everett -- just to name a few. Remember these ladlies?"
4,Good bi-lingual book with a strong moral lesson,"""My Pal Victor"" is a great children's book that also teaches some beginning Latin American Spanish vocablulary and accepting others for who they are. Each page of the book has the text printed in both English and Spanish so it is easy to associate the English and Spanish words. The illustrations are colorful and will easily hold the interest of a young reader. The story line shows the strong friendship between Victor and Dominic.I had a couple of other people take a look at the book and found that most people miss part of the surprise at the end of the book. Victor has a disability which would cause most people to end the book with a comment that they like Victor just the way he is, but the author turns this philosophy on its head when Dominic says that the most important thing about Victor is that he accepts Dominic just the way he is. What a wonderful conclusion and a great way to teach perspective. ""My Pal Victor"" is a recommended read."
4,"My Pal, Victor/Mi amigo, Victor","This is a simple story that any child can relate to. The author takes two boys through many fun experiences, emphasizing that the two are having fun and enjoying one another. By the end of the story, Victor's obvious difference doesn't seem to matter at all. The affirmation at the end doesn't smack of a ""moral"" that would otherwise make it too sweet."
4,Great gift,I bought these for my aunt who just turned 60 and she really likes these. They give her a good workout without being too difficult.
2,Buy it at the second hand book store,Save your money. Nothing new here. Characters and plot very thin.
5,One of the best records you never heard,"One of the best records you never heard... if you haven't that is and you really should. Some records are maybe just a little too good to be a massive success but this deserves your undivided attention.The Family Stand was one mighty talented collective, in each and every department (as singers, writers, musicians, producers...) This is like a soul map of musical possibilities within so-called 'black music'. I mean it pretty much touches on every pre-dominantly black form of music, be it blues, jazz, soul, funk, gospel... (even some rap) ofcourse it also totally rocks and I guess being white, listening to this makes me feel SO white but hey I still want to listen to this more & more & more please, it just feels so damn good. Not that it's strictly feel-good music, in fact a lot of these songs deal with very serious matters, so worth paying attention to the lyrics as well.If you see this baby somewhere don't hesitate to snap it up."
5,The Art of The Ballad And The Artist Behind It,"The true test for any musician is in his interpretation of a ballad. If that's the case, Roy Hargrove has passed the test with flying colors. In his new venture, Roy displays a wide range of artistry, filled with both passion and tenderness. ""Moment To Moment"" also features the outstanding Hargrove Quintet and The Monterey Jazz Chamber Orchestra.This album is about falling in love and losing yourself in awesome wonder. From the moment you lay eyes on that someone across a crowded room, to the moment your bodies intertwine and dance in the stardust of ecstacy. Each ballad is a page from the book of love. Note for note, this album is soul-stirring, and simply sweet. Roy Hargrove's latest feat is an absolute treat for anyone who lives life from moment to moment."
5,Great End of the Day Music,"Looking for a CD to relax by? This is it. It is relaxing, romantic and soothing. Pour yourself a glass of wine, sit by the fire, soak in the tub or get romantic with this CD. There is nothing brassy about this trumpet music. Wonderful orchestration blends magically with the horn. Roy is sublime."
3,simply doesnt do justice to him live,"roy will give you a raging heart/head ache when he plays any of these ballads live. sets the mood in > wham. consider yourself warned...no fear, he'll (most likely) shake you out of it w. some funk, be bop, or hip hop tune his way - & but will leave an indelible romantic mark."
4,luminous Chet Baker sound - lovers will listen!,"Roy Hargrove has taken a page from early Miles Davis, but moreso from early Chet Baker. Also from Stan Getz. That is, to concentrate first on sound, on the beauty of the notes. He blows sweet well formed, luminous tones which put me in mind of Chet with strings. Staying close to the melodic line.After all, if the first note doesn't sound good, it doesn't matter how many notes follow. More Jazz musicians should heed his example.This CD is standards with lush orchestral romantic arrangements behind him, which some purists may say isn't Jazzy enough, but I predict the warm sound will be popular with lovers of all ages. In fact, on the first day of it's release, I'll go out on a limb and predict a best seller for these who like Chet Baker, early Miles Davis, and Diana Krall."
5,Love it,Uncle Luke came correct on this cd for real.Luke sure did a great job for his first solo project & made sure to not put too much 2 Live Crew on this one.This project was about Luke going solo & making sure he did it just right.
3,"This is okay, but not great","This is a phone of good quality, but I'd recommend buying a better phone if it will be your primary phone. We use it very little as it's just not quite as good as our other phones."
4,EXCELLANT PHONE AT A LOW PRICE,THIS PHONE IS GREAT IT HAS NO ENTERFERANCE AND YOU CAN HEAR THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE TALKING TO PURFECTLY CLEAR . I WOULD TELL ANY ONE WHO ASKED ME THAT THIS IS A GREAT PHONE.
5,i had a lovely journey....,"i had a lovely journey through the south of france with greg and j.p.! from the moment i strapped on my goggles (reading glasses), to the end of the trip when i jumped off the vespa scooter (rose from the 'barker'lounger), the fun never stopped. mr. edmont's magical writing style had me enchanted from begining to end. even though i read this book several months ago, i feel as if it were yesterday. the 'memories' of this adventure are so vivid in my mind, i enjoy recalling so many of the events as if i actually expirienced them. i've heard this wonderful story is being made into a movie! watch for me, i'll be first in line at the theater. i'm looking forward to the next book by this author!!"
2,"Yes, but","Pleasant light reading it is, ideal for middle school students or anyone stuck in airports and for unaccustomed readers (as mentioned by other reviewers). But it's an early writing effort and it does not, when all is said, deliver so much of France, nor France accurately, as to deserve perfect praise."
2,OK.. for the few hits that they have.,"I originally bought the CD for 'Relax', which was a big hit in the 80's especially in England. With the exception of a few other hits, it doesn't have much to offer. I was looking forward to the re-makes of Bruce Springsteen's songs, but you can't compare. Basically, if you don't have the CD with 'Relax', then it might be worth it; otherwise there are better ways to spend your $$$. B"
3,Buy Welcome to the pleasure dome -,"- by far superior album by Frankie. The greatest hits misses all the overlaying comments, and thus it misses the point."
1,Wrong,"First of all, Stein was not a feminist. She was male identified in the days where sex change did not exist. And I suspect she's rolling in her grave knowing that she's written as a soprano or maybe bright mezzo in this musical. In fact, the ""wife"" of hers were written more masculine than her. I don't think so. This musical is more about singers' narcissism than a portrait of a human being."
1,Mine's out of plumb constantly,"I brought this expensive gadget to do some framing work. Thought it will save me plenty of time. I was wrong. On a 8' ceiling to floor framing it was out of plumb by 1 inch!. Used a conventional plumb bob with a string to verify. It just didn't work out of the box. Wasted my $$$. From the physical look of the CST Lasermark MP3, it looks like it is made by the same OEM. Check it out yourself. Don't wast your $$ on that one either."
2,check it frequently,This is a great tool when it works. The one I used came out of plumb rendering it useless and the work I produced with it worthless.
3,Used,"Item was touted as new. The packing at been opened, taped shut. The screws on the casing of the tool had been removed and the tool taken apart. Should never be sold as new if sent in this condition."
5,A high school librarian reacts:,"This is one of the most ""literary"" books I've recently read that has the potential of attracting reluctant young adult readers. The slim volume will not intimidate, and the quick-paced, drama-filled narrative will keep them turning pages. Author Helen Frost examines pertinent issues of homelessness, poverty and teen pregnancy in her fictional account of two teenaged sisters torn apart during the Scottish Highland Clearances in 1850. Her interwoven poems between chapters help make this title a unique standout."
4,Cheap and effective,"I bought one of these to replace the passive heat sink on my motherboard, since it used to get hot enough to raise a blister. There aren't any clips or retainers included with this, just some thick, sticky, ""tape"" that peels off easily - for my application, I just ripped the ""compound"" off and used arctic epoxy. It was very effective at lowering the temp of the northbridge chip, despite the fact that the heat sink is pretty small. The fan is a little louder than I would like, but still much quieter than a factory cpu fan, and it's worth it to me to know that the chipset is running cool. I ended up paying $11 just for the epoxy, so this was a relative bargain. I bought another one for my backup rig since this one works so well. I'd estimate that my chipset temps went from nearly 200 degrees, to about 120 degrees."
2,check your northbridge chip format,"If it is a large flat chip, then the sticky tape on this will probably work - maybe most are like this. Mine was a small chip offering little surface area to stick, so it fell off after a while."
2,its ok but falls off the chip,the heatsync only sticks on so if you heat it up too much it melts and falls off. when it falls off it lands in dust and will not stick again.
2,Don't buy this unless your ready to take the risk!,"This item comes in a good packaging. Also comes from a good company - Cooler Master. The bad thing about this product is that it doesnt stick well. After few minutes of application it falls down. Its really a pain in the neck. But other than the way you mount it, it seems to be a good product."
4,Nice,Exactly as described. Thank you very much! It's hard to find anything on this band anymore. Appreciate the condition as well. Thanx!
4,Not as pictured,"Monster cables are very good cables and I received the cables I ordered. However, the heads on the cables were made by Neutrik which is fine, but they are not the same as the ones in the photo (the photo is inaccurate which I find annoying!)."
2,sending it back,It arrived with the feathers bent and placed funny...the mask fit weird and the head band looked strange...eh not much else to say...this is the first item ive ordered from amazon that I'm sending back
2,Not the same color as in the picture,"The color is misleading as well. It looks like a very light gold from the picture but it is a very deep metallic gold in person. I would have been fine with that if the mask had come unbroken. This item came today with broken feathers due to the fact that it was not packaged correctly. It was put into a box with only the plastic packing the mask was surrounded by (which is too small for the mask in the 1st place). When I opened the box and upon further inspection, 2 feathers were broken and quite a few were bent. My friend placed a similar order for another style mask which had larger feathers and they had put Storopacks around the mask to ship it safely (hers came unharmed)."
1,Would not recommend.,This mask is too big for my face. The headband attachment does not look good. It is a thick black headband attached to the mask by clear strips of plastic. For the mask to fit on my adult sized head the headband had to be far behind my ears. Not pleased. Product would be better with elastic to hold on face.
4,mardi gras masquerade mask,"This mask is well made and I was surprised to see that it actually has a head band, and you can easily flip the mask up to sit on top of your head"
4,Very Pretty Mask,Very nice mask. Be aware that it is attached to a head band and does not have a strap to go around the head. It worked fine but we had to change a hairstyle to accommodate the mask.
4,Beautiful but too big ):,"The mask was nicely packed and everything looked great until I put the mask on... Before ordering it I wondered if it would be too big, and sadly it was. The fabric is comfortable on my skin but because of my high cheek bones, it presses on my eyes too much. My small nose doesn't match the half mask style as well. It looks like I have no nose. The headband style was comfortable and the clear connecting strips could be covered by my long black hair. I wish I didn't have to return it."
1,I hate it .. a lot.,"I really didn't like it at all. It was extremely big on me, and the feather's kept bugging me and they were too big. It also looks really cheap in person."
3,Nice,"The mask came on time and was packaged well. Its pretty and fit well. The feathers can be fragile. One kinda ""snapped"" in the middle but was still in tact. I figured it would come with an elastic strap to go around my head but it was attached to a black headband instead. I didnt get to wear it on Halloween because I ran out of contacts and it didnt look that good over glasses (but if u have to wear it over glasses i think it would be fine), but i plan on wearing it next year!"
4,"Good quality, especially for the price",When ordering I wasn't sure how this headband was going to work. It's a black headband that sits like a normal headband on top of your head but has clear plastic strips that connect it near the ears to the mask. If you have dark hair you can probably figure a way to style your hair around it but if you have light hair the headband will be clearly visable. Otherwise the headband does allow it to rest comfortably on your face without any pressure. The inside is a soft black felt that is comfortable when it touches your skin. The eye holes are large enough that I could probably wear false eye lashes and they wouldn't touch it. And it came packaged very nicely so the feathers weren't crushed in shipping.
3,I Wish I loved it...,"I really wished I loved this mask. It is beautifully made and a really nice style if it isn't on my face. The mask is a little large for my face and didn't quite look right. I could have gotten over that, but I just couldn't work with the headband style. I had high hopes for the headband style. When I lifted it up it would not stay. It just falls right back down unless you balance it on your head like a hat. If I try to lower it back onto my face it pushes my hair forward and ruins my hairstyle. I thought about taking the headband off and putting a ribbon to tie it instead, but I didn't want to do all that work so I just returned it. Too bad, it really is beautiful for the price!"
4,Love this mask,"I had a masquerade ball style birthday party to attend, and I didn't want to wear a cheapie mask that is a paper plate and sequins, so I bought this one. It's great, but it's not adjustable, and I have a small head. It stuck out too far and was uncomfortable. I didn't even end up wearing it that much because of it. But if you have a bigger face than me, which is likely, it's great! It's super beautiful and I have had it for over a year and nothing has broken."
2,Evolution Not Up To Specs,"True that the 25th Anniversary album this was taken from is a good album, but whoever the idiot was who re-recorded it destroyed it. It was recorded to CD too fast. None of the tracks have the original quality. Notes are too high and it all zips together too fast. If you want a CD version of the 25th Anniversary album, this is better than nothing, but don't expect the same quality."
3,For Keff Lovers only,"Released as the 25th Anniversary CD, it is incredibly underrated. It's just a shame more fans don't enjoy Keff McCullogh's wonderful scores to Doctor Who. It might possibly be that most of the tracks are taken from the 24th season of the show, and possibly one of the most unpopular seasons, so fans are gonna quibble about this one. I've gotten a lot of enjoyment from this CD, but it's a shame that there isn't more tracks from the 25th season, which this CD is supposed to commemorate, which is odd, and more tracks from ""Time and the Rani"", one of McCullogh's best soundtracks. Even if this isn't for you, ""8891 Overture"" is worth a listen....This review is for the original release of the CD."
1,Poor reissue of the 25th Anniversary album,Don't waste your money on this poor reissue of the Doctor Who 25th Anniversary album - the music has been mastered at the wrong speed [it plays far too slow] pitching the sound down over the entire album
4,"Elegant, space saving solution","Our workstation area didn't allow a traditional pc setup with separate monitor & cpu. Our first thought for an upgrade from our aging laptop was an iMac, but we didn't want to deal with the change in operating system. This model very nicely filled our needs without taking up a ton of space. The wireless keyboard & mouse also go in a drawer when not in use, so the system takes up next to no space. Great little performer..."
1,Cheap Non-standard tripod,"I bought this unit knowing that the supplied tripod was junk, though the rest of the unit appeared to be well engineered and reasonably constructed. I figured I could toss out the tripod and use one that I already had. Stanley foiled this plan by making the tripod mount a thoroughly non-standard one. You are forced to use the short, lightweight tripod that comes with the unit."
3,Old Acela colors,I purchased this model for my husband who collects Amtrak cars (and works for Amtrak too). It was a Christmas present and I thought he would be more excited than he actually was because it was unexpected. However he told me that this is the old Amtrak Acela color scheme that is no longer used. So... now he will alter it himself. We'll be looking for N scale decals.
5,Bachmann Trains,I buy Bachmann products all the time and will buy them in the future. Bachmann has an outstanding reputation. Bachmann is a name you can trust when it comes to model railroading.
5,A Window into Another World,"Great Documentary about the absurdly scandalous Emmett Till murder case. I love the American Experience series, but this is an especially good one. Lots of great interview footage from people who were there and new Emmett Till at the time. Probably a pivotal episode in garnering national media attention to the Jim Crow south, and ultimately encouraging people in the civil rights movement to stand up to this epic nonsense."
5,America's redemption,"A very moving documentary, that made me angry about the abhorrent racism in southern states. This absorbing documentary learnt me, a European, also a lot about how America deals with the dark pages in its history. This is democracy at its best."
3,not too bad,"i'm glad she got to do this before her untimely demise. being a fan of paul i know what to expect from linda and it is true to her form. although i would like to hear more than samples allow, i'm sure this is an effort i would like to purchase. cook of the house has always been the song i most identified linda with, and it seems her vocal style does not vary much from that one."
2,A horrible voice,"I love Paul McCartney and you can here his production shining through on a lot of these tracks, but he couldn't fix his wive's voice. I have been waiting for years to get my hands on ""Oriental Nightfish,"" but that is the only reason to buy this. I'll tell you one thing, Beatles fans like me will buy anything remotely connected with one of the guys."
1,Tone Deaf Lady,Why did she make this record? i'm sorry she's dead and all but this is terrible!!She never had any musical talent. She makes Yoko OHNO look like a talent.
4,Everlasting Memory,"To a doubting World, this album has to be definite proof that the woman behind Sir Paul McCartney wasn't just an occasional percussionist, but very much an extremely talented musician in her own right! If this has to be our final memory of the late Linda McCartney, then all that can be said is that she's done everyone proud!"
3,Not THAT bad!,"Let me be honest. I bought this album because I am a huge Paul McCartney fan. Knowing that Linda's singing voice can fall flat quite often, I was surprised that the material was better than I had anticipated and her voice suits her musical style quite well. Except for maybe a few of the ""true"" alternative stations, you probably won't hear any of this music on the radio.Linda was probably one of the most recognized vegetarians in the world so it is suprising that there are only two songs devoted to her animal rights, ""Cow"" and ""The White Coated Man"". The albums' standout tracks are ""Mr Sandman"", ""The Light Comes From Within"" and ""Oriental Nightfish"". If you are a fan of the '50's girl group songs, then there is actually a lot to like about this album since that seems to be the heavy influence on this album. Like I said earlier, not a bad album. In fact, not bad at all!"
4,A nice time guaranteed for all,"Linda McCartney had a very special way to sing, maybe doesn't like to all, but it's nice and restfull, I enjoyed listening what the woman said (and says)."
2,BORING.,"Linda was a good backup singer, And a loving wife , but a lead singer She is not. The cd has it's moments but not enough to carry it a must for fans, The rest might not like."
2,No es bueno,"Come on, if anyone other than the wife of a Beatle would have recorded this album, it would have been thrown straight in the bargain bin a week after its release...that is if it wasnt rejected by the record company first. Interesting from the standpoint of hearing some McCartney one man band efforts backing Linda. 2 stars for ""Love's Full Glory"" & ""Apaloosa"". The standout track is the dynamtie ""Light Comes From Within"", its the only track I'm not embarrassed to play loud! Other than that, it is quite painful to the ears. Not the voice, just the material. I mean, anyone with a 2 dollar Casio keyboard could have written ""Cow"". Linda was a great person, spectacular photographer and an activist for many good casues, but she simply was not a musician."
1,"She is great , but not singing","Linda is a great person, but we cannot let this mist our eyes and ears. She cant sing,and I am sure she only recorded because she is Linda. I love Paul and Linda, she has great cook books and I do have them, she is a fantastic photographer but sing.... PS: I like "" Cook of the House"""
4,"A fun, whimsical delight!","When I heard this CD, I just cried. I am sure that Paul had a difficult time with putting the finishing touches on this, but when you hear Linda's voice, and lyrics, you can see why Paul loved her so. She was quite a woman and I consider her a fine role model to those of us that grew up with her. Three cheers for Linda who left us all a cheerful living legacy of her thoughts."
4,Hermoso tributo,Un maravilloso tributo de Paul McCartney a su desaparecida esposa. Una obra sublime en todo
1,Sad be True,"I went into the music store to listen to this album before buying it.....simply because I found it hard to believe Linda had acquired a musical gift all of a sudden. I'm sorry but why put herself in a position of making an album when she simply has no talent for it, What's wrong with just being a photographer and Paul's wife? Wouldn't it be nice if we all could get up one morming and say I think I'll make an album today even though I can't carry a note in a hand basket....and then have everyone go out and buy it just because my husband is Paul Mccartney. I'm really sick of hearing about this perfect marriage they had. I have learned from experience that anytime people go out of their way to tell everyone how perfect their relationship is, that its usually the opposiite. I think we all learn very quickly in life that there is no fantasy marriage or relationship. It's just not REALITY. It seems Paul is already seeing someone else so let's let him get on with it and be happy."
3,Home movies...,"I got this as a gift and expect it to totally suck but, HEY, it's not too bad! Sounds like she had a lot of fun making these tracks. Yeah, okay, she's not the best singer in the world, but the cleverness of the tunes and production make up for it. No top-10 classics here but I kinda like it."
3,a diamond in the rough,"At first listen the talent is not obvious, but after a couple of plays, you start seeing the artistic qualities. I think it is like female-zappa, and every bit as fresh and interesting. When you top eccentric Linda-ness with McCartneys musicianship you get one of the most original and enjoyable albums of the decade."
4,Linda is Real,"This collection of songs, when approached with an open mind and open heart, will not disappoint. Linda's talent as a songwriter is on a par with the rest of her artistic accomplishments, and her collaborators are some of the best! Excellent musicianship, combined with fresh, imaginative arrangements and subject matter, provide entertainment and enlightenment that hits the spot and the nail on the head, at the same time."
4,COMMENT ON TEXTBOOK ANCIENT RHETORICS BY JOHN CHUCKMAN,The essay by John Chuckman on page 199 alone makes the book worth its price. Don't miss it.
5,Good product,"I love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product."
3,Probably not what you are expecting,"There is a solid plastic core to this, a rod which is probably something ~1mm or so thick.. So, if you are expecting it for the current carrying capability, you will be let down. For me, these were for the side surrounds and the far backs, so I'm only mildly content with it, as it's more of a 'knowing it's not right' thing versus hearing (the room isn't that large, so it's only like 100 watts to each, and those channels aren't as active as the fronts)Been getting more and more let down with Monstercable. I'd like to see this cheaping out trend go away."
5,Excellent Speaker Wire,"Was as advertised. Good thick flexable wire, well insultated. Small white writing on one side of the wires soyou can keep postive and negitive connections the same at both ends."
5,THE BEST Motivational training tool,"Motivation comes in a small package. Get this and log your runs including detail of your speed throughout. Plug in your ipod and iTunes will automatically send the data from your run to the Nike+ website traking your training. On the Nike website you can set goals, race people across the world, and even get HTML to embed your runs for viewing on your blog, website, myspace, whatever you have that takes HTML (with autmoatic updates).GET IT- YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT!"
1,More information should be given,The Nike is not compatible with the 1GB nano shuffle. This should be included in the advertisement.
1,Only Very Very Old Nano,"I have 1st and 2second generation nano. The sport kit will not work with either. went to apple store and was told it will not work with any nano but the aluminum back nano, which cannot be bought any more.Don't waste your money. The other reviews are just electronic store review salesmen.Go to an apple store and ask the question. What apple product currently sold will the sport kit be compatible?Answer!None!"
3,nike + ipod,"was disappointed that i didn't have a pouch or whatever you need to old the sensor in. i guess that was extra. they should tell you that if you don't have the nike adpated ipod shoe, you will have this sensor to deal with.i do enjoy the feedback that i get when i press the ipod. though, sometimes when i would press the middle button to get feedback, the bottom menu button presses and this pauses workout. it gets irritating."
5,Fantastic!,This kit is wonderful! It was incredibly easy to set up and start using almost immediately after opening the package. I reccommend it to anyone who wants a great way of tracking their workout and progress while still being able to listen to their iPods!
1,Totally not happy with mine!,"I tried calibrating it and it would not take b/c it said my distance did not equal what the sensor tracked. I did 1 mile and it had .60. Then I tried half a mile and it said .30. Then I did 1 mile and it calculated .46. ANNOYING! I will try it again but it is frustrating and I got it as a Christmas gift and my husband threw away the box so I cannot return it.Edit..Okay, now it works but I am unable to change the number of stars in my review.I would give it 4 stars (losing a star for not working properly in the beginning)."
2,Won't calibrate my run,"I wear this on a pouch in my non-Nike shoe. I didn't need to calibrate it for my warm up walk and it measured distance/pace fine. However, after repeated attempts outside and on a treadmill it won't recognize my run mileage. I've tried to calibrate this thing at least 5 times and it stays at 0.0 for running. VERY FRUSTRATING!! However it still recognizes my walk rate. I don't understand what the problem and fix could be. If it would recognize my run distance/pace then this device would be great."
4,Good gadget,"I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. Be aware that you do have to have a particular model of Nike Shox to use this transmitter. That pair of shoes was about $100 (which is not bad, considering he runs 5-6 days a week). My husband said it took just a minute to set this thing up on his iPod Nano, and he has been using it for two weeks with no problems. It reports calories burned, distance travelled, and a few other things. Good product."
1,short battery life,"I really liked this product. But I am also very disappointed by the sensor. I own two of this product. The first one worked excellent for 3 months then the sensor's battery run out. So I bought the second one. To save battery this time I turn the sensor off when the first time I am not using it, then it can't be turn on anymore.I only use it for 1 hour per day. When not running, I am not wearing it at all. The sensor suppose to last for 1000 hours, but 1 hour per day for 3 month (about 100 day)-is only about 100 running hours then the battery died.The second one shows me the poor quality of switch on the sensor."
5,A great personal coach!,"This has been a great tool and companion on runs!It is easy to use, and easy to upload to Nike for progress on my running goals.I've enjoyed my runs more knowing my pace, distance, and goal is at my finger tips."
3,You get what you pay for,"Essentially you are buying a very expensive pedometer. As far as pedometers go it is probably one of the best, if not the best I have ever actually seen. It gives good instructions for set-up and it is easy to do. I bought this for my wife, who actually bought me a GPS watch, and we set up her sensor with my watch. We ran a mile, exact and then walked .25 mile, exact. Afterwords we went for a run. The distance was accurate to about .1-.2 miles, and the pace was off. The pace was probably off because of the discrepency in the mileage though.Not the most accurate way to measure distance but pretty solid, especially since it was a bit less expensive than my watch.Our biggest concern is buying the armband with it. Everything fits nice and neat, but the screen is covered by material. You cannot see what is going on. We are going to half to perform some surgury to the armband."
2,Great idea--if it would work!,"Worked great--for 1 week. Now the iPod can't find/recognize the receiver unit, so the system won't work. The Apple website had a specific fix to try, but no luck. This happened after a rainy day run, but I can't imagine the unit isn't water resistant.Anyway, I loved it for a week; now it's going back."
2,Too hard to calibrate,"We're having a devil of a time calibrating this device. I bought this for my partner, who doesn't fit well into Nike shoes, so he's continuing to use his favorite running shoes. He has the Marware sport suit for the sensor, which came highly recommended. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get the calibration to work at all. Apparently, judging from all of the other messages from users, this is a known problem -- whether or not you're using the sport kit with a pair of Nike shoes.I think this is very much a beta product. Great idea, but just too buggy in its first version."
2,Great Idea - Unreliable Product,"It's a great idea but unfortunately for me, the product has been unreliable and the whole experience has been frustrating.I purchased my Nike+ IPOD Sport Kit 2 weeks ago. On my first run, the IPOD didn't recognize the sensor. I took it back to the store and the salesperson got it to work right away. It then worked perfectly on my 2nd and 3rd runs. It was incredibly motivating and the Nike Online Log was just what I needed to keep track of things. However, on my third run the IPOD didn't recognize the receiver. I took it back and exchanged it for another kit. I went out for my run and now it didn't recognize the sensor! I got home and it worked - go figure. I'm going for a run this evening and we'll see how it goes. If it doesn't work, I give up. I'll just return it for a refund."
1,worked for about 3 weeks,"This was a great idea for a product, and is definitely more affordable than its expensive GPS counterparts, but I did not find it to be the most accurate when it was working. After about 3 weeks of use it started telling me that I had stopped my workout while I was still running. It got to the point of doing this every 3-5 minutes before I stopped using it."
1,Does NOT work with the newest 6th Generation Nano,"I feel bad that money was wasted on this product. I have the new tiny square Nano, 6th generation. The directions to sync, begin run, stop run, set type of exercise, calories burned, distance covered etc. all require you to go to Nike + iPod on the Nano, then to SETTINGS. The new Nano does not have a SETTINGS field. I've been trying to figure out a way to start this thing, especially since I went out and bought the Nike+ shoes, which weren't cheap. The good news is that the built in pedometer in the Nano works with the Nike + iPod site, so at least it records how many steps I take each day. So if that's all you need, don't bother buying the Sport Kit or the shoes. The pedometer works with any shoes or none at all."
2,Small and lightweight but inaccurate,"The sport kit is easy enough to use but even after calibration on a treadmill, the distances it logged were still off by 5% to 6%. If you just need a rough estimate of your training runs, it'll work fine. If you're more serious about your times and splits, you'll have to look elsewhere. Mine died after a year and I didn't bother to replace it."
4,I'd say this is for only TRUE I Love Lucy nuts. :-),"I received ""The I Love Lucy Trivia Game"" about a year ago, and it's still in fine condition! So, I'd say this wears pretty good, but it sure isn't very educational for kids. Sorry, but what hotel the Mertzes stayed at nearly 50 years ago, just isn't that important in making big decisions. :-/Although! This is a great gift for that ""Lucy nut"" in your life. It has really hard trivia, not just simple questions like, ""What color was Lucy's hair?"" or something else WAY too easy. This will truly challenge those ""Lucy nuts"" out there, so I recommend it to anyone with a passion for ""Lucy"". :-DI do hope this review helped. :-)"
3,Disappointing,"I was so excited when I recieved this as a birthday gift for my 20th birthday! After my party, I had a few people stay behind and play this game. We were all avid Lucy fans, yet none of us found this game all that much fun. I probably liked it the best out of everyone, but even I got bored with it. The questions are just too difficult for most people. They ask for specifics that are impossible to know, unless you are a complete Lucy fanatic. I will never play this game in a group again. I do find it fun, however, to just look through the cards every once in a while. There is a lot of information in the cards, and I suppose this game could be fun for some one who has seen every Lucy episode 200 times."
2,"Lame, Lame, Lame...","I'm an avid I Love Lucy girl and I couldn't answer a lot of the questions. The questions are really, really hard and the game is way more frustrating then entertaining. Use the money to buy something fun."
2,Doesn't blend well,"I am sorry to say I have to disagree with the other reviewers on this one. I bought this concealer for the undereye area, and it just does not blend very well for me. I even tried applying a thin layer of moisturizer underneath, but it still ends up looking dry and cakey on me, and settling into my fine lines. No one product works for everyone, and I was unable to find a bad review of this concealer anywhere on the internet before I bought it, but I will be sticking with my Loreal True Match Concealer, until I find something better."
2,Quick reading ~ A no-brainer,"This book moves right along as well as jumps around. The crude jokes were expected, even the snide comments. He is as his TV character is, rude, crude and socially unacceptable. I don't think I'd be inclined to read this book again or buy another he wrote or endorsed. I do enjoy the TV show but all I can say is it took me 2 hours to read the book, the show is only 30 minutes...."
3,First half is great,"I've never watched the Drew Carey Show & I really liked the first half of the book. At times I laughed really hard. However just after the halfway mark he starts to talk about his ""friend"" Larry and the book takes a serious dive as it stops being funny & just sounds like he's whining all the time.It's not too bad, as expected it is low brow & I nearly gave this 4 stars."
2,Having a Drink with Drew,"Drew Carey is very direct and writes with a no-nonsense approach. He divulges behind the scenes info from his TV show, and shares some personal thoughts and history that might have been better left unwritten--but I'll give him credit for having guts. The jokes were not as funny as I was expecting, but Carey, like any drinking buddy, is not as funny as he thinks he is."
2,Drew was a Marine?,"Dirty jokes and beer is a lot funnier than the books my brother usually buys me for Christmas (Foucault's Pendulum, Everest). Drew is a regular guy. He drinks beer, takes chances and makes it. The short stories are disturbingly interesting. They get progressively better."
2,some funny jokes and stories . . .,"but i wish there were a lot more . . . also, i did not find the second half (drew's short stories) particularly funny or interesting."
4,Hillarious! Vintage Carey! Unrefined & Fun,"Drew Carey loves to have fun, and he doesn't care who knows it!!! This book describes many of the ways that Drew pursues happiness. He seems like he'd be loads of fun to hang around with."
4,Easy Reading,What would you expect from Drew Carey? A easy read that is amusing. The chapters are short and funny for the most part.This is not a pulitizer prize winner but it is good for a chuckle.
2,"2 1/2 stars,for half of the book...","Ok the reason I gave this book a rate of 2 1/2 is because a little bitmore than half of Drew Carey's book was so heartfelt and so funny.Hestated his thoughts on life,his family stories,his big screen t.v. and that made a great first half.He had some of the funniest jokes i have ever heard,his 101 jokes,I will not say the name of them because there may be some children looking at this review.I can say,being that I am a male and live by Ohio I can relate to some of his experiences. But,when we get into his short stories I nearly gave up on him.I was hoping for the book to end so I could start to read a quality book.When the last page came upon,I was glad and hardly read it.If you are sure you need to read this book,check it out from the local library or borrow it from a friend.Do not waste your money.Yes I am a teen male,I enjoy reading ""dirty jokes"" and things but what Carey is writing about is rape and bull.Good Day..."
4,just to hear drew swear makes ths book worth it,"Basically, the beginning of this book is a riot. Drew tells his life the only way he could, in a raw way. He swears, talks about drinking and strippers, and other cool stuff like that. And for the first couple hundred pages, this book is worth it. The weekness of the book is when he tries to write funny stories. Problem is, they are not that funny. I couldn't even finish most of them. But over all, when he tells HIS story, good book. Buy it"
1,Disappointed,"Drew Carey's audiotape, ""Dirty Jokes and Beer"" made me disenchanted with a guy who, his show lead me to believe, was a talented comedian. It is the adult version of a little boy telling ""pee-pee"" jokes. If this is truly what the real-life Drew Carey thinks is humor, it's a shame. The book is a disappointment."
4,one of the funniest books i have ever read,this book will make you laugh your a** off. The real lifestories make our everyday lives seem better. I definetly recomendthis book for everyone.
4,"Good mindless reading about an ""everyday"", celebrity.","Drew Carey had no problem in telling the reader that he was an everday guy, who grew up in a typical household and joked around and went on with life just as others do. My problem in reading his story though was his seemingly shallow approach to his new found stardom. Where he may still have his down to earth personality and still value a dollar, he has reached a point in his life where he doesn't have to worry about rent, a mortgage and putting food on the table. He shouldn't use the theme in his book that he is still the typical guy when we all know this is the furthest from the truth.Overall it was funny and it made me chuckle in numerous sections. It was funny relaxed reading, yet too much on the personal side."
3,Could've been worse,"Carey is not a member of the literary elite, but he never claims to be. There are quite a few good laughs in what is far from your typical comedian-gets-a-sitcom-and-therefore-a-book-deal tome, which should automatically garner Carey better consideration than any of his peers. The author comes off as an average Joe who actually wanted to write a book, rather than find another way to cash in on sudden success."
3,Funny and entertaining,"Dirty Jokes and Beer is an amusing collection of thoughts and ramblings by comedian Drew Carey. It is by turns hilarious and heart wrenching; however, his short stories he has included in the book are not particularly good. Many of them lack any real direction and are full of wanton violence and coarse language and succeed only in depressing or annoying the reader. But, nevertheless, the book is, just like the man himself, pretty damn funny. He includes jokes at the start of each chapter, and there are some great anecdotes in it that are worth the purchase price."
5,You can judge THIS book by it's cover.,my title here says it all. In this book Carey gives us tons of ammo to fire back at friends. If you're looking for a book to zip though and laugh out loud....get this book. Just don't expect Shakespere!
1,dog vitamins,I have 2 pugs that have NEVER refused anything to eat. Neither pug will touch these vitamins. I've since bought other brands and have no problem. They smell terrible to me too.
3,Quite boring,"The books is a collection of a few articles written by a few famous investors. Of course, there is some wisdom in their words, but overall the selection looks pretty random. The articles are not really logically connected, written about different markets, different times and often are given out of the context. Just like mixing the best ingridients is not nessesary makes a good meal, this books is not adding much value by combining the pieces together.It's also hard to recommend this book to any category of investors. It's clearly not a getting started guide for the beginners because there is no introduction to the market. And the serious investors would probably rather read the original works of those star investors."
4,Basic critical thinking made easy,"Ruggiero sets down a good basis for beginning critical thinkers and is innovative in his categorizing of logical errors. His explanations of knowledge and relativism are insightful and great for a basic overview of those particular topics. He nearly contradicts himself in a few places, that is the only major flaw in this text. I agree with many things in this book and disagree with a few things too, but I believe that this book will open up the world of critical thinking and philosophy for anyone who is just beginning to delve into those areas. The readability of this book also adds to its appeal. I encourage anyone reading this book to reflect and reread much of it and practice critical thinking by not taking Ruggiero's word for everything, check it out for yourself."
1,Careful,"This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking, would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds. I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off."
3,"sometimes yes, sometimes no","The product seems to work, I have nothing else to compare my heartrate with but the problem I find is it takes too long to give you a reading. The manual says it should only take 10 seconds at the most but there are times I wait 30 seconds. It is not easy to hold down the buttons for that long while trying to maintain a good heart rate."
3,Battery may be dead,"The other reviews I read said that the watch didn't work when they received it. I didn't listen and purchased it anyway. I called the company directly and said to get another battery and it should work. Amazon should check to see if the watch is on before they send it. I'm sure it will work, but its a pain on top of the embarrassment of giving it as a gift."
2,Never buy from this company,I purchased this item and it never stated a size on the description. It came and was made for a woman. I tried calling the company over several days left no answer only allowed to leave message on a machine. I never got called back had to contact amazon to resolve this matter.
4,"Great, fresh approach!","I was delighted to find a book that puts ""caring"" and ""leadership/management"" together. At a time when so much emphasis is put on risk management in Personnel/Human Relations, it is reassuring and liberating to have support in using our natural instincts in our roles in management."
2,It was disappointing.,The book was more about the author and her life than about the process of the third eye. i found it to be disappointing at best.
5,Third Eye Open,"A beautiful, straight forward book that you can use to enrich your life or even heal yourself. This book is filled with exercises for accessing the healer inside yourself. Susan is devoted to the tools of awareness and sharing the roadmaps to find them. She has helped me change my life."
1,Save your money,"False new-age prophets cloud the way for those with genuine wisdom and insight. Besides poor editing and redundant content, this volume offers little other than an apparent vanity work for the author. Save your money and look at the work of well-known, well-established and competent advisors: Sylvia Brown, John Edward and James van Praagh, to name a few."
1,Beware False or Misleading Advertisment,It shows 3 body for the price but you will only recieve 1 body for the price and it smells good if you like your big strong masculine Dog smelling Baby powder fresh... Yea right..The other dogs get a chuckle..Thought it was a bargan for 3 bottle ...what a surprise.....
1,Not what I thought I would get,"First off, I'm stupid for not reading the reviews first before purchasing. Second the reviews are TRUE! It looks like your getting 3 seperate bottle of different scents but they send you one bottle of nasty nasty baby powder scent crap. Smells awful, bad advertising. Don't buy."
1,Fly Trap !,Unfortunately this feeder style has such large feeding ports that flies and bugs easily get into the sugar solution and contaminate it. Try their Ultra Model with a new port design which keeps flies out.
4,just a simple feeder,"Less is more.They kept it simple and it works. It is easy to clean and holds a ton.I can't give it 5 stars because the lid does not ""snap"" on like they say. It simply sits over the base with no secure snap-on. And, the price is alot for what you get. If you want a Hummingbird feeder though, that's the cost. $20 now and you can forget about it. Or buy something cheaper (like we did) and after you're tired of it leaking, return it and buy this one.Note that it will leak if it tips (like from the wind). The lid does not snap on and create a tight seal. If you fill it all the way up to the full line, expect it to leak from the lid / base connection when it tips in the blowing wind."
1,Buy a different hummingbird feeder!,"This feeder is terrible. We actually got rid of it and purchased another. The shallow design and difficulty prying the lid on and off make it cumbersome at best. Also, ants had no problem getting in and taking over. My new feeder has no such issues."
5,Best feeder I have ever owned!,This hummingbird feeder is awesome! I have owned A LOT of feeders over the years and this one is simple and designed so good that it attracts more hummers and I have not had one an problem. The only issue was the wasp/hornets drinking the water out of the ant mote but I solved that issue by putting some lemon juice/water mixture and they were no longer hanging around. Very easy to clean and change out food. I have recommended this to everyone that I know.
5,Love this feeder!,"Hummzingers are the best feeders. It's easy to clean, and attracts lots of hummingbirds. I have another smaller hummzinger feeder, and am happy with that one as well."
4,Does its job,"I gave this feeder to my mom for mothers day and so far it has worked really well. It looks just like the picture and appears pretty sturdy. We haven't had any ant or bee troubles and hummingbirds started coming to the feeder within one day of us putting it outside. now hummingbirds come to the feeder many times a day, its quite nice."
4,Works Great!,"I purchased the Hummzinger Excel because we were having a problem with bees getting in the feeder we had. I bought a feeder with bee guards on it, but the bees were still able to push through the bee guards and get the hummingbird food. The bees can't get to the hummingbird food with the Excel, so they haven't been around. The only con with the Excel is it only holds 16 oz of food. I wish it held a little more because we have a lot of hummingbirds, and I sometimes have to fill it every day. Other than that, it's working great."
2,"Easy cleaning, but no Holy Grail","Once I learned how to snap apart this feeder (thumb in the center of the ant moat, finger lift on the inside edge of the red lid) I appreciated its easy cleaning and reloading Aspects.... I'm not crazy about the fact that the holes in the lid do not appear to have been deburred/ smoothed out after the manufacturing extrusion process. The barely detectable rough edges inside the holes have been great for mold to gain a foothold, and I've not yet been able to scrub the black away. In addition to fixing this, engineers at Hummzinger should try to true the screw and the feeder before packaging. My feeder leans because the screw hole seems to have been set in the plastic without leveling, allowing leakage of nectar (there's a 1/4 inch difference in nectar level from one side of the feeder to the other). As one of the more expensive hummingbird feeders on the market, these flaws are disappointing."
1,I'VE GOT ONE YOU CAN HAVE.,With the promise of the reviews I ordered one of these last year to add to my collection. I have good luck with the tall cylindrical type feeders. But this one was useless and the birds avoided it like a plague. Don't waste your money. No bird would go near it. Not attractive to them apparently. And we had hundreds of hummers in our yard last year. It's just a poor design with a very small reservoir.
2,Disappointed in attraction of hummingbirds,"This feeder is easy to clean and fill, but it doesn't seem to attract many hummingbirds. I have a Perky Pet feeder that the hummingbirds seem to prefer even though the feeders are only about 15 feet apart. The Hummzinger feeder does not attract bees, but doesn't attract birds very well. I seldom see birds at it. Even when the bees are around the Perky Pet tube feeder, the hummingbirds go to that feeder rather than the Hummzinger."
1,Not shipped yet,"Would like to tell you how well I like this item but it was ordered on May 28, 2012 and per the order status....it has not been shipped yet. I will update you when it is received."
4,can't wait to get the album,"Although I still cannot tell the difference between the first two tracks they are both awesome. It is pure dance, but dance at it's best, in that it is still listenable. Great stuff. In addition the remix of Niji is really good too. It is a song that most trance DJs have a copy of in its origianal form, and rightfully so because Takyu Ishino's influence really shines through in it so it is a little minimalistic, but still great."
4,sharbrooker,"I really would like to have it on CD and as I was a very young girl when I listened to this music and have been looking for this and I had the album and it got soaked in the flood. I have search every music stores, oldies, and you name it and to be disappointed that they no longer manufacture this particular album, Please let me know if you still have these in CD. I really appreciated it very much."
1,"Light and Thin,..That's all you get from this","If you're looking for a heavy duty floor mat, this one is not for you. It's very light and thin mat. I'm not sure what to do with this after I bought this one. Do not trust the weight provided because it's not accurated. It should be less than 2 pounds even with the shipping package. I'm very disappointed!!!"
1,A disappointing piece of junk,"Don't let the name fool you. This is made in China, not in North or South Carolina. It is made of some flimsy tropical wood that doesn't hold screws. The screws in the drawer hinges pulled out and only sawdust was left where the screws used to be. The finish is thinner than paper and easily scratched off. The parts were packaged in flimsy polystyrene sheets that disintegrated and made a huge mess as the parts were removed from the box. This piece of junk is so unworthy of the usual fine products found on this web site."
5,fabulous cds,"Our 20 month old son *adores* these CDs. Several times, every day, he insists we listen to ""stop that monkey"" - a line from one of the readings. I dont' mind listening to them either which is a big plus compared to other kids music."
3,Fair to middling,"I don't particularly reccommend this for a complete neophyte to signing, as I was when I got this book. As other reviewers have suggested, a thorough video, or book-video combination might be best. There is a CD that comes with the book, however, it is too simple and has minimalist videos, making it by and large useless for a beginner.The saving grace of Signing for Dummies is clear and simple sign diagramming, imbuing the book with at least one redeeming quality."
3,Probably not the best on the market,"Of the asl books that I've purchased, this is probably my least favorite. With that said, the book is not a complete waste of time or money. It does provide some useful information, the cd is good, & I enjoyed the cartoons."
1,Where's my review?,"I submitted a review a couple weeks ago. Worked on it hard. Gave many examples. It conforms to your ""review guidelines"" Where is it?"
2,Think stainless steel.,"I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made."
4,Does what it is suppose to,"Does what it is suppose to. Wires are a little thin and may not last you a long time if you move them around and end up bending/snapping the metal inside. However, for this price do you expect to bend the cable over and over and not expect to have it break? This is great for hooking up a computer to a TV for audio if you don't have HDMI since you won't be bending the cable."
2,FORAY Battery-Operated Cordless Pencil Sharpener Mill Black,"It does sharp, but I had to presshard to have good sharp pencil.Here is very strange part of thispencil sharpener.I emptyed the pencil dust into thetrash. I put back the plastic pencillid back on. It automatically functio-ning by itself without me putting thepencil in the hole of pencil sharpener.It didn't sharp well after that. Allof sudden, the sharpener stopped functio-ning. So,I trashed pencil sharpener.Later,I decided to buy a another Foraymodern curbed style black pencil sharp-ener. This one works better. Recently,I written a review about it to amazon.com.Takako Masuda"
4,IF I DON'T LEARN TO BUY....,"This is one of DIDO'S best tunes, totally agree on this, so personal and really related to anyone at my age around the mid-20's, so great and personal, and of course atuobiografical, the musical arrangement as always simple and beautiful, the mix it's ok, the Stoned remix it's a taste of was been goin' around the club this days so if this life is for rent....don't work for it....just kidding!"
3,GREAT PERFORMANCES / CRAPPY DVD,"It's obvious that whoever shot these performances was not a guitar player and had little if any experience taping live shows, let alone guitar concerts. Camera choices are probably the worst they could choose and instead of the guitar (or wide shots) it's Mr. Dimeola's sweaty in-trance face that we see most of the time. Dimeola could have been playing the congas and no one would have noticed because the guitar is hardly seen here. One of the best songs ""Mediterranean Sundance"" (which is not even listed on the DVD probably because the director/producer had never heard of Dimeola before he got the gig assigned) is shot in its entirety from what looks to be the third floor. And so on.It's also true that there's not three performances as Amazon says, but two. What a silly way to ruin what could have been a great concert DVD. Buy it and play it through the speakers with the TV set switched off."
3,"Good Audio, Lousy Video","As a guitarist myself, I love Al Dimeola. Back to his early days with Chick Corea, he has developed into an even more awesome guitarist. I was hoping this DVD would be something I could watch and play again and again. but though the music was immensely enjoyable, the vidography so totally sucked as to completely detract and distract from the music. So little of his playing and fretwork from a constant frontal view, as in watching a concert. Instead, a contant, sometimes rapid and mostly just irritating, cutting from one view to another, mostly from the back, I completely lost insterest and started getting frustrated. What a shame. So much of the awe is in watching him play. So little enjoyment here."
4,Great Guitarist! A Acoustic Odyessy,"I loved the Dvd. I have been a Fan of his for 25yrs and he is still doing new and innovative things in his music. This Dvd shows him in the mid 80's and 90's in the Montreux Music Festival. The sound is good and Al is excellent. The reason for four stars instead of five is the camera angles are sometimes sh owing his back when they should be on his guitar.But it is worth the price. Thanks!David v. Martinez San Antonio,Texas"
3,"No Trio, but still pretty good.","I love Al Di Meola's music but was VERY disappointed to see that there was no 1989 performance with the trio. I really bought this DVD for that performance but was very, very, very disappointed that the trio wasn't on here. I did enjoy the other two concerts but the second set (1993) wasn't mixed very well."
3,Great idea but this one is TOO SMALL,"Amazon did a lousy job of titling and describing this, but it's the MINI that you are buying here. I was surprised when I got mine and reread the listing and in the fine print it does say mini, as does the packaging in the pic, but who is trying to read the packaging in the pic before you buy. These kinds of brushes work very well on everything I've tried them on: blankets, seat cushions, upholstery, cat tree, clothing. I've even used it on area rugs to get the big stuff up, prior to vacuuming, but this particular model is way too small. There is another model that is sizeably larger and the job is going to go faster with it. There's really nothing better out there and I find it works even better if I spritz it with water. Still takes some elbow grease, but the cat hair just rolls up and off the item being brushed. You may get an occasional bit of fur on the brush, but not much. We have been using them for years. Highly recommend the larger one but not this mini."
2,Just ok for my dog,"For my golden retriever, it is a bit small and picks up only some hair. I actually have to recommend the Love Glove, which did a much better job on my dog's hair."
3,"Works, but there's got to be something better","I like this product, it does what it's supposed to, and maybe it's just my cheap couch, but this pulls a bunch of lint as well as cat fur. I have one of those fiber couches that fur gets stuck between the stitching and it's hard to get out, and this does the trick, but it's somewhat difficult because once you get the fur out of the couch, static cling kicks in and the fur sticks to the brush. I've tried vacuuming, lint rolling, duct tape and this brush, and the brush works the best in conjunction with a vacuum hose to be the most effective."
2,Not What I Expected,I got this Pet Hair Removal Brush to get the pet hair off of the furniture. It doesn't work well at all. The only thing it will actually remove hair from is my cat and I already have several brushes for that task. Did not need another one. Very hard to remove hair from it as well. I would not recommend this brush to take hair off of furniture since it doesn't.
4,FURemover,This brush is gentle on the dog and she seems to like it. It does help removing some of her fur.
4,Great for Students,"Milton Glaser has rightly been called a genius. With the exception of some printing issues (the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars), this is a great book. Besides cataloguing much of Glaser's work, the interviews and pieces which show the progression of his work are amazing. I'd highly recommend this to ANYONE involved in teh creative process, but especially to students who may not fully realize how the creative process can play out (and scoffs at the idea of multiple sketches and comps)"
4,Great scanner,The scanner is performing better than I anticipated. It is able to receive more transmissions than the previous model I had. I am very pleased with the unit.
5,top scanner,received product as scheduled. one of the best scanners I have ever owned. great vesatility and receiving capabilities
2,Not a happy camper,The product is probably good but all the parts was not included. Have tried to get the antenna from company but am told that it is our os stock. This was a Christmas gift so he is disappointed.
5,Funk-O-Metal,"This not your average Hair-Metal Band. I loved the first one, but this one is better. Of the 30 bands I listened to in 1992, this one still sounds awesome. The energy on this album is frickin' incredible. It has the pump-you-up energy of late 80's metal without the cheesiness, but with the 70's funk that makes you want to get up and go. Any fan of 80's-90's metal that regrets the musical malaise since Nirvana detoured the music industry should pick this up. This is some finger-lickin hardcore."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Quality","Love the idea of this, wish it worked right.This product would be very very handy if it worked properly.The only reason this product got two stars is because one of the sides worked correctly.The level must not be straight inside the device because the lines produced by the devise are often on a slight diagonal.I used it for many hanging projects and when double checking the lines with a standard level I found that this item was only working on one side.Hopefully the next model will have better quality control!"
4,It's a square,"While I haven't used it for my original intent yet , I have used it on other jobs. The laser shows up pretty good outdoors for me. Even with a good deal of sunlight. It's great for setting patio blocks and you can check level both directions at the same time. I like it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I'm a little surprised at the stellar reviews. I bought mine a few years ago soon after it was first released. ""This is crap!"" I said.Forget the putty...I never used it. Is it square...yes it was (to a point). My issue was the quality of the laser line...fuzzy and inaccurate. Having owned a few construction lasers, I'd like to think I know a good laser from an inaccurate one. I consider this the latter. For some people, the tolerance should be fine. Unless they markedly improved the line quality since my purchased, I'd still consider this garbage, which is where I promptly placed it. Indeed you get what you pay for."
4,Handy Item,"Great if you need a straight line. Lasers are fairly bright, but you'll need to use a target most of the time to see the line clearly. Wish it had some sort of leveling feet for when you are using it as a square. Otherwise, well worth the price. Have not checked levels for accuracy."
5,Does what you need it to,"I was looking for a laser square to help assist with a tiling job I was doing. Laser levels are expensive and only provide one direction. This laser level square provides two lasers which helps to keep your lines straight. The ""level"" part comes in with the two bubble levels affixed over both laser housings. They provide some sort of goofy clay to help affix this item to a wall but it'd be easier to have someone assist you. The item does have a small bit of heft to it so which is nice. Overall if you're just looking to get a laser square, you can't go wrong with this for the price."
2,"Good product, but doesn't stick to wall well","It's a good product, but it doesn't stick to the wall well. I learned this the hard way when it fell off and damaged my moulding. Otherwise the lasers and levels work fine."
5,Good value,I recently received the product. It is a good value for the price compared to the similar products available in the local stores. It does its job well. It requires 3 AA batteries which are cheaper over other kinds. Overall I am happy with the product and the price I paid for it.
5,Absolutely Hot !!!,"This is Olga Tanon's most recent release. It contains a nice mix of fast flamenco style dance music, techno sounding love songs and romantic pop ballads. The song ""Tu Amor"" is a techno-flamenco marvel. The lyrics are sooo passionate and the beat just grabs you and won't let go. I listen to it every morning. Olga has a fabulously powerful voice, but she can also bring out the emotions in the softest ballad. ""Hielo Y Fuego"" is also wonderful; the tempo changes and versatility of her band make this song unique. And of course, ""La Magia del Ritmo"" won't let you sit still. The final track, ""Un Hombre Y Una Mujer"" is a warm and romantic love song which really showcases Olga's rich smooth voice. I highly recommend this album although it has a different feel than her earlier Merengue albums. !Ay que lindo!"
5,Olga's Great Music,"this is one of olga's best albums. She mixes some pop and flamenco in the song "" Tu Amor "". She is also shows off her great voice in "" hielo y fuego"". In every song their is great songs. This album is the best! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Is it a region?,"Richard Drake is convincing that there are enough distinctions in history, society and culture to Appalachia for it to be a distinct region. Perhaps less convincing is his discussion of the ""Yeoman"" culture. The scope of the book is broad starting with the Indian Era through the Civil War, to the ""new Appalachia"" of 1930-2000, and into the future. All though he states the region is diverse, I would have appreciated more discussion about differences within the region: I suspect that SE Kentucky is very different than Northern Pennsylvania.The book tends to be dry and only when I focused more on my own state (Kentucky) did it seem more coherent. The inclusion of 16 pages of black and white photographs, also help give a more complete picture."
2,Treacherous terrain,"There are books that have a way of keeping your attention, no matter what the topic. This is not one of them. I felt as if I were cranking a car that would not start, and at page 149 the battery finally died on me. However, you can relive your school days of sleeping through history class, this time without worrying about the consequences. It didn't help that I had preceded this book by reading Mayflower."
4,Very good after shave,"This is a good after shave and it last for long time, the price is worthy the product is very good, also it is with only a light scent so you can use another perfume for your body without create any note of contrast."
2,nothing great,This aftershave is just lotion. Nothing great. It doesn't irritate but it also doesn't smell wonderfully. I will not buy it again.(shipping was fast)
5,You just can't go wrong with this book,This is one of the best bread books I have ever used! The recipes are easy and they work. I use a stand mixer with hook attachment and the dough comes out perfect every time. The ingredients are easy to find so there is no searching for that elusive exotic ingredient. I can't say enough good things about this book. If you can only buy one bread making book this would be my first choice!
4,smaller than I thought,"I know it give the dimensions, and I know that other reviews mentioned it would be good for toddler size hands. BUT, it still was smaller than I expected it to be. I wish there was a larger size version. No body seemed to mind the small size, since the lights make is so cool."
2,Very Generic Video,"I was not impressed with this generic production. There were a few short clips of pioneer interviews, but mostly generic video of still photos and shallow coverage of this otherwise interesting portion of avaition history--certainly not worth the price ..i would not recommend this at all..there are many other FAR more deserving videos available."
1,Necesita pagar $10 para ayudar cada tiempo!! Es muy mal!,"No paga por esta programa. Hay un precio por CADA tiempo para ayudar de $10, CADA tiempo. Es un mejor ""rip-off"" de la compania ""Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking."""
3,The Recluse of Herald Square,"This is for the serious reader, interested in history and a little genealogy. It was suggested to me by a family member, without any hints...I was surprised to find my own family name in the list of many claiming to be heirs. I believe the person they hired to sort out the genealogy didn't follow proper protocol in deciding where her money went...if they had...I might be living more lavishly myself."
2,Not quite mediocre,"This is what I'd call a warm-fuzzy. The characters are all too nice to be believable and the mystery is lame.I object most of all to the awkward way the author uses adjectives. In the first chapter alone we have ""kindly patronage"", ""craggily handsome"", ""amazingly kind"", ""gloriously confidence-building"" ""refreshingly cool"", ""reassuringly unhysterical"", ""enormously luxurious"", ""achingly tired"", ""irresistably reminded"", and ""frightenly young"". The whole book reads like someone told her to lengthen it by 8 pages, so she got out her list of adjectives and started plugging them in.And how about, ""Curiosity got the better of Willow's uncharacteristic yeilding to Tom's wish to protect her from herself."" Please! Where was this writer's editor?"
3,Good in that parady sort of way,"Not the kind of CD you can listen too for hours on end, but still something that is fun to listen to once in a while. Very enjoyable in that Pat Boone ""In a metal mood"" sort of way."
5,"Spectacular and moving, one of her absolute best","Suzanne Brockman is a master, and this is a masterpiece. I loved it! It made me laugh and cry, and stay up until 2 a.m. just to finish it. The characters are so real you wish they really existed. Jake's grief and healing are wonderful to watch. All this, and suspense, too! If I could write like her, I'd die a happy woman."
4,The Admiral's Bride.......good romance with suspense.....,"The Admiral's Wife by Suzanne Brockman is a romantic espionage thriller. DR. Zoe Lange, who is a thirty-something bio-chemist, and Jake Robinson, who is an aging Navy Seal hero, are thrown together in an undercover operation to retrieve six stolen canisters of Trip-X, which is a deadly powder when activated by water, could wipe out huge cities at one time.The May-December romance between Zoe and Jake is filled with sexual tension with just the right amount of suspense to keep the plot moving along. Great book for a relaxed afternoon read.I downloaded this ebook from my local library and read it on my kindle fire. I think I'll be reading more of Suzanne Brockman's books."
1,Painful,Having trouble sleeping than this is the book for you. Kept falling asleep everytime i sarted to read it. The worst book I have read in a very long time and I read at least two books a week. I kept hoping after reading the reviews that it would get better but was glad when I finished it. This book was not for me.
4,"Older man and younger woman, but it works","I don't normally go for the older man/younger woman type books, but Ms. Brockmann's handling of the situation worked. And I can't think of a guy more deserving of finding love again than the widower, ""Admiral.""I'm glad to see a few of Brockmann's original Tall Dark & Dangerous series are being republished, namely books 1 & 2, Prince Joe and Forever Blue. I hope they'll continue and republish all of them. I'd buy them again. Admiral's Bride is #7 in the series. If they don't... and if you can get your hands on this one, it's worth it. Although it's not absolutely necessary, I recommend reading Brockmann's ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"" (book #6 in the series) to get a bit more of the Admiral's history before reading this one. While it's Crash's story, the Admiral and his first love, Daisy, are featured heavily in it."
5,STEAMY,"Very sensual and steamy in the plot! Just from reading this series, I want to find a SEAL myself! A must read!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"I was so disappointed. I have never read any of Suzanne Brockman's books and won't read another one. I was expecting a thriller and got a romance. That said if you are looking for romance this book will turn you on. If you are expecting a great story about Navy Seals and Terrorists and protecting our country, you'll be disappointed. It's just an afterthought to the romance.Sorry, not my type of book."
2,An interesting story but.....,"Ms. Brockmann certainly knows how to write an interesting story but, her book lacks characterization. Zoe never seemed to get over the awe, she felt for Jake. One got the feeling that it was a surface love, rather than an enduring one. The age difference was always a problem in Jake's mind. And to be honest, it was always a problem in mine. Also, the story lacked sensuality. You expect it to be there because of their forced intimacy, and it's not. Categories alot of time, have too little of something in them; rather it be the plot, (this one was good), the romance itself, (just ok) or the sensuality. (weak) Ms. Brockmann will not be an auto-buy for me."
4,They are from England.,"There names are Sinead,Edele,Lindsay and Keavy. They are B Witchen,Ther sign are Sinead a flower, Edele a B,keavy a star and Lindsey a cat.They are all very prety and Edele and Keavy they are sisters.There most popular song is C'est la Vie. They are from Engand."
2,extremely disappointed,"I have no idea what this book is supposed to be. I thought I am buying an instructional dvd -- it's not. Yes, he breaks down each selection into different sections and each section is played at a regular speed and a slow speed. Other than that, there are no instructions -- he doesn't say anything, not a single blessed word -- he simply plays. The techniques demonstrated are extemely advanced -- concert level stuff. Essentially, the guy is a wizard at rasqueados -- all the magic on this dvd is in the right hand. Unless you can do 10 different kinds of rasqueados yourself, don't spend the money -- it's pointless."
3,Wish it was made in the US.,"Have yet to use this tow strap. I just got it for emergency situations. It seems reasonably built, but I would not have gotten it if I'd known it was made in China. There are several alternatives made in the US, some I believe from this company. I purchase a lot of tools and I am very aware of the quality differences."
5,forgotten classic,"people may not now this group and i am amazed this is its first review. dame dash and brother darien financed this. its psychedelic musically with funk, jazz and rock all being used for beats. clark kent made a beat for these guys. lyrically its not amazing but its cool and easy to get hold of and cheap, at least these rappers were pretty slick with their rhymes.i would advise this to fans of dame dash and old school rap fans since musically and stylisically its on par with rappers of the era.peace to beanie sigel one of the realest hope u get outta jail soon,""what ya life life like"" damn u on point wit dat."
3,Take off game,"Description sounded really cool. My kids did not like playing it. Said it was too complicated moving the airplanes around, cheaply made. It was just okay."
3,Nice light reading,"Though not one of my all time favorites, this is an interesting book that does make you want to finish in a single evening."
4,"Funny, simple and touching","A Fan (Shawn Yu) hated Crazy so much. He thought Crazy was the killer of his father (since he heard that Crazy would 'kill' the father if the father doesn't pay back his debt). In fact, his father was suicide, feeling hopeless of the life. In the father's coffin, A Fan found a big frog and he thought the frog was the reincarnation of the father...and that frog died because Crazy stepped on it! That's why for years A Fan regarded Crazy as the killer of his father. But without power, A fan couldn't do anything but hitting Crazy's head with stones for 10 years!That's the beginning of the overall story. Basically, it's a simple story talking about how two grown-up guys chasing their dream girls and how they deal with day-to-day challenges. A Fan did a romantic (but cheating) letter to his dream girl by copying drama movies' tag lines into his love letter.Funny, compelling and tickling your inner sense."
3,Better than average for the maden captured by the priate,The herione and heer feience are on their way to jamaca and her aunt after she is caught in a flurtation with an actor. They are shipwreced and captured by savages then by pirates. Decent characterization and OK plot with a little humor but over all not as good as In Too Deep.
3,A look back to a more peaceful time.,"This is a wonderful book by the then President of Pakistan from the middle 1960s, I believe. What a change from then to now. Then we had peace and even cooperation between the West and the Muslim world. Now we have chaos between the two sides.The President speaks of his hopes for the future and his progress to date in uplifting lives in his native Pakistan. What would he say of today's world wide conflicts among Muslims, among Westernized countries, and internally among his own Pakistani people? Some answers may be found by going back and reading this book."
4,I Normally Don't Care For Black Metal But C.O.F. Rock!!!,"I had heard and seen alot about Cradle of Filth, from their magazine covers to their controversial appearances in concert. Finally, curiosity got the better of me and I picked up the re-issue of 'Cruelty...' w/o having heard a single track on it. Upon first listening, I was blown away! I had heard a lot about black metal but until now I hadn't actually heard any black metal. Needless, to say Cradle of Filth rock! The music is the most complex, energetic, and haunting music I have ever heard. Like a bloody scream in the night, Dani's voice pierces your ears and sticks with you for a long time after listening. Fortunately, the time between listenings is short for I am constantly playing this album, in continuous awe of it. The only thing that offsets the whole experience is the fact that I can't understand a word that is sung. Good thing they print the lyrics. I normally don't go for Black Metal, but I am definitely a fan of Cradle of Filth!"
4,It is pretty cool,"I'm not a really big fan of this type of music but someone I know recomended this to me so I bought it. It is definately cool. The songs are intense and the whole concept is interesting. I've proceeded in buying one of their other albums ""Dusk...And Her Embrace"" because I like the imagery. I'll probablly get their others but the main reason I don't like this type of music really sticks threw on this album...I can't make out what they're trying to say. Dusk is also like that but only at times, not all the time."
5,Dark Warrior from stanbul,COME AND JON OUR DARK IMMORTAL ARMY OF SOULS AND SACRFCE THE VRGNS FOR OUR LUCFER
5,OOGDEBAY!,"Ah yes. Ahhhhhhhh. Yes. There are seven deadly sins and Cradle of Filth is guilty of thirteen of them. Ahhhhhhh, yesssssss. <shudder gurgle wither shriek>"
5,Best album '98,"I already liked Cradle from their other albums but this one is deffinately the best one they ever made. I first bought it as a present for a friend of mine and only taped it ..... one week later I had the cd myself ... and I even bought this limited edition too. ""cruelty brought thee orchids"" is my fav song and to my surprise I heard Dani at a concert say it was their 'masterpiece' ..... And besides I love the story of Lady Erzebeth Bathory!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A truly fightning masterpiece,"WOW! This album really packs a punch. Very powerful music, intense lyrics, and awesome guitar work. Dani Filth has the most unique (and chilling) voice I've ever heard. Just because this is gothic metal it is far from loud and unmelodic. Yes it's hard but the keyboard work is fantastic and the drumming is very very good, though I think a drum machine may be used. I agree with a reviewer a few reviews down, the recording isn't perfect and it really needs more bass. Moving on, Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids has to be one of the greatest goth-metal songs ever performed. This song is intensely powerful and very well written. Every song has genuinely frightening, yet poetic lyrics. Overall great musicianship and haunting lyrics makes this a must buy. This is real scary music, unlike groups such as Rob Zombie and Slipknot, sleep with the lights on."
5,AT LEAST GIVE THE MELVINS A LITTLE CREDIT,"The Melvins are obviously not a very popular group, but they are very good anyway. This is their best CD, and ""Revolve"" is their best song. Don't say that they suck because they are not popular, or you've never even heard them. Even if you are not a Melvins fan, you should at least give ""Revolve"" a chance. This CD is definitly worth the price (considering how cheap it is), even for someone who is just taking a chance on an unknown CD. These people were Kurt Cobain's inspiration. If they were good enough for Kurt, they are probably good enough for you."
4,It's Hard!,"God might forgive the Melvins for inspring grunge, especially since they've gone on to other things. This is stoner music at its best - metal with a brain. Loud, fast, and deep, ""Revolve"" blasts us with power and confidence, while slower tracks like ""Shevil"" give us, um, breathing room. Keep it moving, boys."
4,Wahoo for Mr. Buzz,"This album, OH MAN THIS ALBUM!!!I bought this CD because it had two of my favorite songs on it (i.e. ""Sweet Willie Rollbar"" and ""Revolve"")it is a good CD, don't get me wrong, but there are like two tracks with no music on it (like the last track) which kind of pistons me off when a band will do that, put ambient noise on an album and title it as if it were a song!"
3,Love the MUSIC... would give it a 3 and 1/2 stars but can't.,"I am a big melvins fan. It's the same cenerio (don't know how to spell that word) with tool. The tracks with music on them are great, but the weird noises for 5 minutes get REALLY annoying. But, if your a stoner then i'm sure that the noises ""are trippy, man"". Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the actual songs but all together out of the 50 minutes or so, only like 30 minutes is actually music. That really annoys me. So, meh, I think this cd is worth downloading, but not buying."
1,Music For the Most Committed,"After a driving four song opening sequence, concluding with the monster jam ""Revolve"", the Melvins decide to delve into ambient noise, destroying the momentum and stopping the cd dead. I'm all for experimenting, but for God sakes know what works and what should stay in the can! The Melvins idea of experimenting is starting a song (if you can call it that) in one style, then ending it in a radically different tone, failing to fuse the two together. If you think it's great to crank up your speaker to hear this electronic noodling, then get blown away when they suddenly decide to play a metal riff...then buy this cd. To me this is old and sounds like the Melvins got into really bad King Crimson. This is not the Melvin's accessible, it's their most difficult. If you like heavy stuff, get Bullhead. Houdini is also very good, though the last song falls into the Stoner Witch mode."
1,Lyrics and the song titles are stupid!!!,I'll admit the band is heavy and they have a decent groove but thats it!! What kind of name is Skweetis?? Stoner Witch?? Sweet Willyrollbar?? LOL!!! I mean you people can't take this crap seriously right?? But I guess meaningless songs turn you on....like Ziggy Stardust....another stupid name from the king of all buttlovers...Are the Melvins buttlovers too?? Must be if you idiots like it!
2,Vinyl 4pc Floor mats,"The item does not grip the floor carpet and bunched up under the accelerator. OK for other sections. Bought a thicker, heavier mat for driver's side."
1,Didn't work for me,"I have a mostly glass greenhouse. This summer we replaced most of the roof glass panels with a channelled plastic polycarbonate which could not be clipped onto the glass with the previously used glass clips. I ordered this tape to overlay and seal the seam between the plastic polycarbonate and the glass. When the tape came in, I washed and dried the seams where the tape was going to be placed. The tape went on great and I thought it would work perfectly. I was very disappointed when it all came loose as soon as the weather cooled off. I looked out and what tape hadn't come completely off was flapping around loose in the wind."
3,Doesn't stick well,Purchased tape for installing plastic sheeting on windows. Does not stick too well; had to use painters tape on top of the tape for added staying power.
3,an ok cd,"This cd is a good one but definately not their best. It has good lyrics for the most part but it doesn't have the same sound as their other ones. It's good enough to buy but if you're just getting into Bad Religion then start off with something more like ""Against the Grain"" or ""No Control"" or ""All Ages"". Those are the better ones."
4,3.5 actually,"another decent one from BR and it gives us classic BR which is catchy, melodic songs with sarcastic, intelligent (highly-intelligent -you may need a dictionary) and critical songs agaisnt society' ills. i will say this again, one of the greatest rhythm sections i have ever heard who hold it all together. unfortunately, there is no Brett Gurewitz(he used to play guitar and write lyrics for this band but he left to run his Record Label--epitaph)Still BR crank out tight nuggets of punk while Gregg Graffin sings melodic punk-style lyrics that are critical, stark, to the point and you may need a dictionary for but always compell you to think. the songs themselves are part punk but do mix in a variety of other styles to spice up the soup."
4,An album led just by Greg Graffin,"I liked how Greg Graffin took control in this album...cuz it's a pretty good album,with anthemic songs and a pretty good song writing and artwork....but yeah it's the first bad religion album without Brett Gurewitz....they stayed 6 long years without Brett since 1996 to 2002...and that make a turning point to BR among these years......or something...."
5,It may not be BR's best...,"but it's certainly my favorite :) I love every song from this album and by talking to a few people, I've realized that there's some difficulty picking out which of the tracks are supposed to be bad (so it's more taste-based than quality-based). Anyway, even if it isn't the best, it is certainly a huge step up from ""The New America"" and ""No Substance."" I think it's also better than ""The Process of Belief"" and ""The Empire Strikes First"", but that's a little harder to argue.So if you are new to Bad Religion, I recommend you start with ""Against the Grain"", ""Generator"", ""Stranger Than Fiction"", or ""Suffer"". If you prefer AtG and Gen over StF and Suf, then you might like ""The Gray Race"" over some of their older albums. Just be sure to steer clear of ""The New America"", ""No Substance"", and ""Into the Unknown""."
3,The low point,"This is Bad Religion's worst album, startlingly uneven and packed to the brim with great ideas that got lost somewhere on the way to execution. Greg Graffin's maturity and songwriting skills seem to vary inversely with the political health of America; he peaked during the gulf war with ""Generator"" and bottomed out in 1996 with this album. Now, with ""The New America"", he seems to be regaining his old facility- as sure a sign as any that W is gonna get elected and that we're all in serious trouble."
2,it just doesnt compare,"what happened? Bad Religion all of a sudden became cheezy on this album. There is no mr brett which sucks. THe only good songs on here are pity the dead and streets of america. I had no idea how important mr brett was in a bad religion album. Every album before this kicks [it]so much better. And it's only downhill without brett. No substance was even worse than this! New America was pretty average but an improvement. THen mr brett came back for proccess and what do u know we get the best bad religion album since recipe for hate!So if you are new to br get all ages because it is a best of from suffer, no control, against the grain and generator. Then get recipe for hate and proccess of belief> Trust me they r so much better than this."
3,Some great songs but some stinkers as well.....,"One of the great things about Bad Religions previous three albums (Generator, Stranger Than Fiction, Recipe For Hate) was that every song was listenable if not great. This is the first Bad Religion CD I got that had to be programmed because songs like The Gray Race, Ten in 2010, Empty Causes and the god awful A Walk, are really poor for Bad Religion standards. They are too repettive, lacking in melody and nauseating. Funny things some of Bad Religion's best songs of all time are on the same album thus at least somewhat redeeming it. Punk Rock Song, Pity The Dead, Come Join Us and Victory find the band as thier finest. Come Join Us is such a verbal onslaught that Gaffin's articulation abilities will amaze you.Bottom Line: A solid but incosistent album. Not the place to start for newbies and unfortunately the place to end for all but the biggest BR fanatics."
4,Greg Graffin at the top of his game.,"I would have given this album five stars, but for one thing; Brian Baker is a candle compared to Brett Gurewitz's stadium light. While Brett Gurewitz gave BR it's link to the people and kept Greg G. from zoning out into a universe of confusion and head-scratching, Brian Baker just helps out to make choruses repetitive and is making them stray from their patented and wonderful style. Why change that which is near perfect, when perfection is impossible?"
5,A straightforward rocker,"The most driving and seamlessly energetic Bad Religion album. An incredibly tight recording, it is impossible to listen to this album without wanting to take on the world. A toe-tapper from start to finish with fist pumpers scattered throughout for good measure, The Gray Race is an album that sets to change the way we see our world."
5,great read,I couldn't put this book down. The characters were very well written and it had a very interesting story line.
2,Disappointing.,"I love Ms. Kinsale's writing, don't get me wrong. My favorite character's are her creations-intelligent, human, far more intricate than norm-but these two just didn't add up. I felt sorry for them. The heroine had shown such promise in the beginning. What really bugged me, though, was there were periods of time when years pass and they didn't even see each other. It's just the next paragraph, and oh, they're together again. The plot twists were so offsetting and unbelievable. Or maybe this is just one of her earlier books, written before historical romances became less of an I hate you, I love you, let's get it on genre."
2,Ohh the monotony!,My friend showed me this band the other day. I didn't have very high hopes of course. The screaming is obsessively annoying and repetitive and many guitar riffs are recycled. The actual singer has a decent voice. They need to kick out screamo kid guy and let him take the vocal helm. Other than this there is not too much new about them. For all the loud pounding songs they are actually very boring and annoying. I mean hell I listen to stuff much heavier and faster than this and it even gives me a headache. Sorry kids they f*ckin pretty much suck.This album gets a D+The bands gets F+
2,Damaged goods,"I bought this recorder for a gift (used). It has no volume on it, so I am seriously disappointed...it was DAMAGED and I am sure the person who sold it to me knew this. I am very very very unhappy."
2,Convient but not warm enough,"Great to tote around in the backback, but when you put an average mug on it, there is usually a rim of ceramic on the bottom of cup. Unfortunately the warmer heats from the center not reaching the outer rim of cup. The result: Coffee does not stay warm."
5,Colorful illust. & fun story cleverly mask geography lesson!,"It isn't often you come across a children's book that's unique in it's story, fun in it's presentation, and a delight to read. Laurie Keller accomplishes this with ""The Scrambled States of America"". The unique idea of each state having it's own personality and voicing it's opinions on his place in the country, is both comical and creative. This book brings together colorful illustrations and a geography lesson, which will have children learning the names & shapes of the states after reading the book for just the first time! MyParenTime.com highly recommends this book as a source of knowledge, imagination, & fun."
5,An educational laugh-fest!,"I don't know who loved this book more--me or my 3 year old son!It's definately a fun way to learn a little about the states, and introduce youngsters to the USA. This was one book he wanted to read again, and again, and again & I was happy to read it each time. It's silly & fun for kids & adults!"
5,The Scrambled States of America by Laurie Keller,"The Scrambled States of America by Laurie Keller is completely hilarious. One day Kansas and Nebraska decide to have a party so the other states can meet each other. At the party the states hear about the different parts of the country and, of course, they want to see the unique parts for themselves. So the states agree to switch spots and they learn a hard lesson, that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Laurie Keller does a remarkable job at telling a good lesson, but still making the story entertaining. Any individual should like this book, the pictures and writing styles are geared toward younger children, but the comments the states make, would make any one laugh out loud. For example Mississippi and Nevada fall in love and Nevada asks Mississippi if she wants to become Mrs.sissippi. I'd rate this book five out of five stars, this would be the ideal book for any young child to learn about the states"
3,The Scrambled States of America (Book),Would definitely recommend purchasing the CD in addition to the book. The various voice characters portray & bring alive the individual states better than one person reading the book aloud to a child. Clever concept; probably more suitable for older children.
4,This is a fun book to read with your children.,My sons are in the third grade and they really enjoy this book. It has funny pictures and every time you look at it you see something different. The story is cute and tells alittle about what each state is known for. This book is a keeper.
2,"Messy, and only few states are mentioned in the main story line","It's messy, and only few states are mentioned in the main story line. You have to refer to a real map from time to time to explain the story to a kid. I give it 2 star, because my 3.5 year old loves me to read this book for him and so far he does lerned 2 states' name from the book. If you want a book to help an older kid to remember all the states, The Little Man in the Map is a must have, but it's not for a 3.5 yr old."
5,Awesome Fun Educational and Interesting game,"This is an awesome game we have had for almost a year now. I can only say that EVERYONE in our family likes playing it. From the adults to the kids, we all have enjoyed it. I do think you have to slow down sometimes and point out ""facts"" to the kids in order for the learning part to take place more easily. My 8 y-o granddaughter and 10 y-o grandson have enjoyed this and ask to play it often. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
3,Okay,"My kids (5 and 9) listened to this once together. 5-year-old listened to it a couple of other times, and now it's gathering dust. It does have little bits of information about each state worked into it, but overall not that informative."
3,"OK hard drive, ""eh"" on the MP3","Okay, seemed like a novel idea. Great price for a portable hard drive slash MP3 player. However, the MP3 player function is a bit cumbersome. It works, the buttons are challenging to use and the functionality is extremely limited. When it comes to storage, it's an excellent device (slow, but very versatile). If you need a good external storage device, this is a good device. If you think you'll use the MP3 functionality, ""eh"" - I'm not sure it will be as useful.Pros: storage functionality, sturdy constructionCons: clunky for an MP3, a bit slow for transferring files between things.You decide - depending on what you need it for. The product arrived timely and without any hitches in expected function and delivery.dw"
1,One of the worst tech products I've ever bought.,"Well I bought this with great expectations. I was sadly disappointed. The instructions were some of the worst I've ever seen. Tech support is non-existent, at least for me. I'm still waiting for them to call me. The distance it works at is greatly exaggerated. I couldn't get it to work more than about 20 feet away. I'm returning the unit today. If you decide to buy this product I hope you have better luck than I did."
2,Not good,I bought two sets of these and both sets have a battery life of not more than 2.5 hours. That makes them useless to me.They do work well when fully charged.
1,bought two of them,I liked this item so much I bought a second one. Unfortunately theyboth broke after a few weeks. I do not know if I can return them---I do not think so. They are made of cheap plastic. They are too expensive forthis kind of material. Somebody stop people from buying this!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,I had high hopes for this unit. My first problem was that it would not connect to my motorola krzr. IO knew nothing about an incompatablility.... Ok so the current problem is when they do connect with my wife's Nokia I can't shut them off afterwards. i am currently trying to send them back to IO for replacemnt /repair. Off hand I wouldn't buy them again.
5,An excellent product at a great price.,"I purchased the IO Gear Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphone Kit for my wife to use while on the treadmill. She loves it and wants me to buy another for my brother-in-law that listens to his DVD movies too loud in the living room. He positively loves it too and his wife is ecstatic about it because she can have peace and quiet!It was a bit confusing at first to figure out how to charge the components but once that was done, it's easy and quick too."
2,Sadly dissapointing,"I had such hopes for the IO Gear Wireless Bluetooth headphones! At last I would be leash free and stop catching the wires on things. Not to be. While they fit well and powered up easily, the sound quality was terrible. I get better sound from some free earphones I brought home from an airline trip!The spoken voice (audio books) had a hollow quality and there was a backround swish that only diminished slightly when the volume was turned down. The instrumental tracks overwhelmed the vocal tracks on all the music CDs I tested. Tech support was of no help. So..I returned them. Even the bargain sale price from Amazon was not worth the bad sound."
2,"good sound from iogear adapter only, not comfort, no skype","the device works fine as a stereo headset. I have tried it with my motorola cell phone, pick up noise, no so smooth talking, But the design of the headset is the least comfortable I have ever seen. it is unbearable for half hour, it even make headache.I received this product just one day ago. I've decide to return it. I didnot try logitech and the motorola ht820, the mic is pluggable in separately and is large and ungainly, I tried it with skype, it come with more noise even cann't talk, I won't use it anymore.one good thing is the adapters can deliver a good music but not 66feet as claim, the distance is ok up to 33feet.the batery is ok for me 4.5hours.over all, this product preformace is not good, it is no a good design as other new tech stuff."
4,Good product but poorly designed,"1 easily set-up with cellphone, computer or the transmitter2 Sound quality is excellent as a bluetooth headset3 it is uncormfortable to wear the headset. the design is poor. It should be improved!"
3,Chocolate,"I had my request accomplished on time and the book is in a perfect condition, considering the age.I'm very satisfied.Tks"
4,I almost feel bad for you people,"If you bought this book hoping to learn how to pick up women by being passive, it's too late...you're not the type of guy who is going to pick up women and no book is going to fix that. Go back to your ramen noodles and your miniature figurine collection and find some good porn to keep you company. I reiterate - books will not teach you how to pick up women. If you can't do it already, nothing and no one will teach you how.This book is satire. It's funny, get it? See, it's making fun of self-help dating books, but in an innocuous way to make you feel better about yourself for being such a passive and ostensibly nice guy. But the writing is cute, usually clever and often successful at raising a smirk. Take it for what it is and like it or not in that context."
1,A lot of tripe not worth the money,"This book is a testimonial for all of the wonderful things a passive man is, but there is virtually no information that can be used to make you more successful with women. You can buy it if you want to but if I were you I would look at other texts unless I was just wanted to be lonely. Maybe if this book were marketed to women so that they would be exposed to all of the wonderful characteristics of a passive man it might have value. Save your cash!!!"
2,Love Rectangle but this wasn't the best,"DJ Rectangle has the BEST cds. He will save you a lot of money because every good rap song is on his cds. This one though i have to say wasn't the best. There is no such thing as a Bad Dj Rectangle cd but this one was my least favorite. Little scratching, mixing, songs weren't as tight more like average...So if you are collecting his albulms buy it but if this is your first, second or third this is not the albulm for you"
4,Not So Mini,cables are flat but fat. really fat. they blend with my wall paint well though. its all good. gets the 4 star because they are way fatter that what i envisioned.
1,bldg code,"was not able to use this product, does not meet bldg codes in minnesota, the jacket was not thick enough,"
3,"Fine speaker wire, not as easily hidden as I had hoped",And the title of the review pretty much says it all.I actually think the standard wire I was using before was more easily hidden as this wire really is quite large.
3,"Not ""superflat""","This wire is barely thinner than the 16 gauge wires I bought for a fraction of the price from Monoprice (3/32"" vs 1/8""). The speaker wires themselves are good quality and may work better under padded carpet as the bump will be spread across and less noticeable. Unfortunately, I bought these to run along the wall and it's far too thick for that. You're better off going with a flat, self-adhesive speaker wire if your intention is have it flat against the wall. However, those cables are significantly more expensive."
3,Poor sound quality,"The convenience of being able to wear it is great, but the sound quality is just flat. I also own a Motorola S9 stereo headset, and the sould quality of this Lubix unit doesn't come close in comparison."
3,Lubix Bluetooth Headset,Not bad. Sound is OK. Very convenient configuration. The only issue I have is I can't seem to get the right combo of plastic and foam earpieces so they stay in my ears.
3,Half way there,I needed a BT stereo headset for the gym. this works great for listening to music on my Htc Kaiser. the only feature that seemed not to work was fast fwd and rewind. the only drawback is that as a handsfree headset its pretty much useless. this headset would be priceless if it could be used as a stereo headset and handsfree headset. the audio quality is just too bad to use. no one could hear me and it was hard for me to hear them. i sitll use it and am very happy with it at the gym but its back to my plantronics once i leave. i may try some Bt tweaks in the PPC and see if that helps.
4,"From YOUR HOME STUDIOS, it's the fabulous Price is Right DVD game","Alright,You enjoy TPiR. You want this game. But you've read very bad reviews on this item (as all DVD games usually get.) But listen, they're wrong. I got this item for my birthday, & I had about 7 or 8 people there. Pratically as soon as I opened it,6/7-8 played this. We all had a good time. Our winner won more than $31,000. The only 2 prolems our you have to remember how much in cash & prizes you've won, & you have to keep picking contestants row. Other than that ( & the fact Todd Newton replaced Bob Barker,) it's the best game Endless Games has made yet.Allen Barber (the one who brought you that 1 vs 100 review.)"
5,Wonderful mix,"The lyrics, vocals, and instrumentation in ""Give Happyhead"" are phenomenal. Unlike the bass-heavy tracks that thud into current popular culture, this CD presents an amazingly well-balanced mix of table-shaking bass (""Atomic Candy"", ""Get Out the Cab, Babe"") and teeth-hurting highs (""Baby USA"", ""Hurt, Dirt, Desire"").Like the other reviewer pointed out, it is a shame that Marsh and crew didn't team up again to create and mix another album."
3,Help for the feet,"Having developed a foot problem, (Metatarsalgia), I needed a better insole than the one that came in my walking shoe. I have ordered and used the Spenco Polysorb Cross Trainer,[[ASIN:B003IXF6BY]] insole. While it fits the shoe, it is somewhat off on my arch and not as comfortable as I would like. I moved on to another brand."
4,Best insoles for the price,"Great insoles, provide cushion and bounce without being too thick or intrusive. Only 4 stars because it's for low to moderate arches, and I have moderate to high arches (this is described on the packaging but NOT within the online listing). They certainly stretch out the life of otherwise on-their-way-out sneakers. I use these in my running shoes, for which I do a lifting class 3x/week."
2,Did not work well for me,"Not sure why these did not work well for me, given the great reviews by others. In my opinion, these are too soft to be useful. You need something hard to support your arch, in order to take some burden off the heel.Also, because these are so soft, hard to swap between shoes."
1,Offer no relief,"I read all the positive reviews online and even contacted the seller prior to making a purchase, these were terrible.First they did not fit my size 9 shoe and I had to cut them down to sizeSecondly the killed my feet.These insoles were hard and made my feet hurt worse than just the shoes alone.I am sad that they didn't offer any suport and dug into the inside of my foot on the right size, these caused me pain like I had never experienced before.The customer service for the seller was great and shipping was fast, but the insoles did not live up to my expectations."
5,Makes for a much more comfortable day...,"I am fortunate enough to be able to wear dressy Rockports to work most days, but replacing the original insoles with these makes them even more comfortable. I did need to trim them down to fit, but that was not terribly difficult. I bought two pair and now I wondering which of my other shoes to put the second set in!"
4,Didn't work for what I thought they would do.,"The insoles are very comfy so if you are looking for general support you should buy them. I took a star off because I was expecting there to be more arch support. There was some, but not enough for me to keep using them."
1,"I had bought this brand before many times, but these aren't it",The heel part is great but the rest is too thin. It actually makes the rest of my foot hurt more since the heel is cushioned and the rest is not while I walk.I had bought several pairs from Footlocker through the years and had hoped these were the same (certainly look identical). But they were a waste of money.
5,Superior Cushion,"My PT recommended these following hip replacement. I have tried other insoles but these provide the most cushion, especially at the heel. I recommend these for anyone needing soften impacts before or after joint replacement."
2,"Bigger than expected, not easy to change from shoe to shoe","Bigger than expected, not easy to change from shoe to shoe. I had to trim them, and I ended buying Profoot Plantar Fasciitis, Women which I loved."
2,Comfortable but not durable,"These felt great at the start, but the foam started crumbling after only a couple of weeks. I wish they were more durable."
1,Not as described,I ordered these insoles for my casual shoes. They are useless as they are very thick and my foot is almost sticking out of the shoe. I cannot use them and cannot return even as i have cut them to fit into my shoe. Waste of money
3,pretty good,"The heel was a little thick for what I was looking for, but they should break in a little. I was looking for more of an athletic fit, these are probably better for walking/hiking."
1,Hurts my heels,"Maybe I'm the odd guy out here, but it feels like there is a lump in the heel where the black circle is. Hurt's my heel and makes these unusable for me. I have an old pair of Spenco inserts I have been using for many years that are very comfortable. I tried to replace them with these, but not the same thing."
4,Great insoles.,I run a lot and have found the Spenco Cross Trainer to be a very reliable and comfortable insole. I use them in all my running shoes.
4,Pretty good,"Well my shin splints don't hurt as much anymore, but i do have really high arches and these are not the best ones for high arches. I feel these ones are made more for people with flat feet."
4,Good and inexpensive,I put these in my running shoes at home and the shoes I keep at the gym to work out/exercise in. I have had them for about a month and think they are great. A great way to extend the life of a shoe for sure; and protect your feet at the same time.
4,I have been using Spenco Inserts for 7+ years!!,"I used to jog 20 miles a week and could not imagine doing this with out a really good insert. Spenco has met my needs and for the price on Amazon, it is a no brainer.[...]"
2,"Good Idea, but Obvious Flaws!","These insoles were comfortable at first but after a little bit of wear, I noticed my arches were aching and the insoles squeaked. After looking at the bottom of the insoles I realized why both things were happening.First, the insoles are unbalanced. In other words, the bottom of the insoles are not one flat piece but rather a couple of raised ridges. Unfortunately, the company was not smart enough to put enough ridges near the arch part of the insole and a result the insoles are uneven. In short, your foot will turn inwards as a result of the uneveniness of the insole and your arches will ache.As far as why the insoles make a squeaking noise, it stems from the same problem. Since the bottom of the insoles are not one flat piece and just a few raised ridges, air gets trapped in between the ridges so it creates air pockets. As soon as you walk it forces the air out of the air pockets which creates a ""gas-like"" noise, which is quite annoying!"
4,"very supportive, but a bit slippery","These soles are very supportive. It was day and night difference when I wore my shoes with these inside. I found the top surface to be a bit slippery even with a pair of very snug fit running shoes. If you want a more sticky pad, get the Walker/Runner (red) type."
3,spenco works better with help,"Working on my second pair of spenco polysorbs and thought I could use a little better cushion for hard floors. Bought the aero 3's thru amazon, took one look and thought the spencos were better...but..I put the aero's under the spencos...ya esta...incredible insole...like the old airwalker soles of the 90's. It's all about the feet, not always the brand name."
2,Can't really use them with shoes...,"I'm sure these are comfortable, but I can't tell because I can't use them with my shoes. They are just way too thick. I can barely fit my feet and these insoles into the shoe at the same time. It's so tight a fit that it actually makes wearing the shoes more uncomfortable. I seriously fear that my shoes might rip. I realize that they're cross trainer insoles, but they still shouldn't take up this much room in the shoe. I don't know, maybe I have uber thick feet. But I've used insoles before, and although they did make the fit tighter, they were nowhere near as bad as these."
4,Support for your feet,My podiatrist recommended these insoles because I have high arches and not much padding under my feet. I walk for exercise and I put the insoles in my walking shoes. I removed the insole in the walking shoe and replaced it with the Spenco insole. The insoles augment the support and cushioning that the walking shoes provide.
3,Might have worked out,"After researching multiple websites about insoles I chose this brand. I was looking for a comfortable insole for my hiking boots and did want to spend the money on Superfeet. What I didn't notice in the Amazon description was that it was for low arches. Unfortunately, I had to return them. I am still trying to decide if the total support insole by Spenco is the way to go. I don't want to have to return something twice."
3,Nice item but beware of thickness,"I purchased this to replace the factory inserts in a pair of Adidas trail running shoes. They feel nice outside the shoe but once inserted they are so tall that they make the shoe very uncomfortable. I understand the irony of complaining that a cushioning insert is too thick as that is how it cushions, but for me, they make the shoe unwearable. Lesson learned, and maybe in another pair they will fit better - but for me this was $10 that couls have been better spent."
4,Cross Trainer Insoles,"Buying these was a very smart decision, but I'm NOT using them in my cross trainer tennis shoes but rather my regular work/walking shoes that I bought from Johnston Murphy.Truthfully, the extra pair I bought FOR my cross trainer workout shoes actually made my feet hurt WORSE because it was exacerbating a pronation condition.I will definitely buy these again because they are nearly half the price of what orthopedic inserts cost in a bricks and mortar outlet."
5,good daytime cologne,"had this cologne before, years ago. it came as promised, nothing to complain about."
4,They still had it...,"Surprisingly solid album, the last Foghat album with Lonesome Dave Peverett before he passed away in 2000. Features the origonal members with mostly new songs but an added bonus of acoustic versions of four songs including ""Just Wanna Make Love To You"" off their first album and ""Take Me to the River"" from the album Night Shift. A fitting swansong for a great boogie band."
2,DVD alone is not enough,"This is a DVD and it covers how to do some basic maint and set up however, there are a lot of guitars in the world and this does not cover every type (It cant). With that said My goal was to gain the confidence to do my own set ups. this video left me wanting for the book so I had the charts and tables to work with."
4,Not for every Bad Religion fan...,"I purchased American Lesion having only a vague idea of what I would hear. I can faithfully say that the album itself (despite its numerous technical flaws) is a pleasent, piano dominated romp through Greg Graffin's mind. I have never heard an album that's songs touched me on such a personal level...especially the opening track ""Opinion"". Those who want hard edged, ""guitar & harmonies"" Bad Religion punk, STAY CLEAR. Those who appreciate Greg's lyrics, go for it. If you liked Bad Religion's ""Into the Unknown"" album, you will probably like this one."
4,Almost Flawless,"Anyone who has listened to Bad Religion's music has no doubt noticed that although it's punk, it's melodically lovely with harmonizing vocals that fit together seamlessly. Bad Religion is the best of all worlds. Angst, art, and intelligence work together to create a unique combination. Greg Graffin's voice is the driving factor of Bad Religion's trademark sound, so I couldn't wait to share this solo CD with friends and family who appreciate good music, but shy away from punk. It's really a great CD. Greg's voice is showcased beautifully. The songs are heartfelt. It has a couple of nice transitions emotionally (especially from the heart-wrenching finality of ""Cease"" to the optimistic, bouncy ""Maybe She Will."")My only gripe is with the self-depricating ""In The Mirror."" At one point Greg belts out ""You piece of sh**, you piece of sh**."" The rest of the album is fairly reserved, so this moment of Greg going postal sticks out like a piece of sh** in a punchbowl."
5,American hero in his own words.,This is a must see for history buffs. Jimmy Doolittle in his own words tells his story with the help of some very famous people. He is an amazing man. My family loved watching it start to finish. Great World War II history and aviation footage.
5,One of the best!,"Swami Satyananda Saraswati is a yoga giant, this book, written by a student of his, reflects his mastery very well. I have many, many books on Sanatana Dharma and Yoga, but if I could only keep two or three this would certainly be one of them. The depth is awesome, providing an explanation of both theory and practice; it's like having a guru in the room with you. If you are interested in doing more than simply obtaining an intellectual understanding by reading yet another yoga book and instead finally getting into some actual sadhana, this book is for you. All of Swamiji Satyananda Saraswati's books are for you. :)Also, please check out the works of Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama, who is perhaps Satyananda Saraswati's only peer."
5,What a GREAT book,The title really says it all. A good Catholic book. This book reminds of going to see Father Lonahan at church in my childhood. He loved me. He was a great father.
4,"More ""Listen"" than ""Dance""","This CD is all right. I wouldn't call it ""great"" because, contrary to what many people have said, some of the tracks aren't good to dance to (specifically the ones in the middle -- either because of long breaks or slow tempo). On the other hand, those that are danceable are pretty good (e.g. ""Time"", ""Rendezvous"", ""Words"", ""1998""), and the ones that aren't can be interesting to listen to. On the whole, therefore, I'd describe it as more of a ""listen CD"" rather than ""dance CD."" An accurate rating would be 3.5 stars, but it comes closer to 4 than to 3. Not bad overall.P.S.: I wonder why one of the reviewers said that this CD was not a seamless mix. It IS a seamless DJ mix, with smooth transitions between tracks."
5,All you have to do is go hmmm 2004 and still a review,"Yes, it's 2004, nearly 2005, trance has been around for a good while now. But guess what,, yes this is dated, but it's still as brilliant as ever. You can listen to it over and over, then you get sick of it don't listen to it for a year, then when you eventually get around to poppin it back in you will be blown away. It doesn't matter if your a begginner at techno trance or a pro listener..... just buy this cd."
5,suprisingly good,"I bought this because of all the good reviews. In the beginning I was very apprehensive for fear that this would turn out to be just another monotonous noise that much too often passes for dance music these days. I was genuinely suprised. The album is very melodic and is one of the few albums that can actually put you in a trance-like state. this is fast, exciting trance music. My only complaint is track #7 which is annoying for its first five minutes or so. The melody kicks in way too late. Still, this is a great CD."
3,He's Done Better...,"Paul Oakenfold is arguably the best DJ in the world. What is not debatable is that he has done better work than this. There are many elements that go into DJ-ing: song selection, pacing, attentiveness to the (live) crowd and its moods/needs, and finally *mixing*. The latter is what's missing from this record; the songs are all okay on their own merits but there is precious little attempt to blend the vibe and the melody of one song into the next.He's at his best when he makes it look easy; releases like 'BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix 4' or 'Goa Trance Mix' feature hour-long sessions where one song merges to the next to form a seamless whole. This is just a collection of club songs, jammed one against another with nothing but the beats matched.For a real taste of what he's all about, try his 'Resident: Two years at Cream' album; the live audience brings out the continuity that this album lacks."
4,Not Quite Up To Par,"I lked this album mixed by Paul Oakenfold. However, it's NOT what I would expect from Mr. Oakenfold. Some of the tracks seem to fall short of the the usual great beats and sounds you hear from him today. Perhaps an earlier album of his? At any rate, I still enjoyed this import from England..Dan"
1,A Very Poor Performance,"could you say that Oakenfold sold out on this mix cd. Since when does he ever play Binary Finary or Cafe Del Mar. However, i can cut him some slack, this is oakey's US debut album and he is trying to his best to impress. So he takes all of last years anthems and with the help of some studio tools comes up with ""Tranceport"". Good try Oakenfold but stick with the white labels. this reminds me of someone, did Pete Tong put you up to this? This mixs is for people that like big tunes put on one mix or people experiencing trance for the first time. cheers! hopefully David ralph does a better job on ""Tranceport 2"""
2,Electronica Genres 101,"Still confused about what is considered trance versus house versus techno music? What about the difference between trance and progressive trance? Have a listen to the suitably named album, Tranceport. Unaltered trance in its purest form mixed by (argueably) the genre's most infamous DJ, Paul Oakenfold.Not a favorite genre of mine, but beloved by many others. I don't mind trance that is mixed into an eclectic set or presented with a little more contrast than what is offered on this album. The first volume of Northern Exposure by Sasha & John Digweed (released the same year) is the kind of dreamy trance that I enjoy. The trance tracks featured on Transport are very old sounding. A steady organ-tone throughout, cresendo drum rolls and a very cheesy narrative track about being spiritually connected with Earth (""Gamemaster"" by Lost Tribe) to top it all off.A timeless classic for some. Electronica's equivalent to Rock's 1980's for me.2/5 stars."
1,Be afraid!!!,"This is introduction to trance, not good music at all. Instead of this album buy oakenfolds oslo compliation. Its the only good music he has done!"
5,Simply the best...,"This is simply one of the best CDs ever! Oakie is *the* best DJ. I've never heard such hyped mixes in my life, I just ordered Resident... I can hardly wait! If you're new to trance or need something that'll keep you dancing... get this CD."
3,Way too canned,"Ok, first there should be no doubt that this is a good CD. BUT, in my opinion its really lacking something that could have put it over the top. The mixing is good, but the song selection really lacks creativity. I guess perhaps that's the point of the CD - but because there are so many obvious hits here it really lacks the edge that other albums in a similar vein have - take for instance Sasha's Global Underground: Ibiza album.On the other hand, if what you are looking for is a lot of obvious hits, this album is probably for you. I just happen to think this type of CD is better when 1/4 or 1/3 of the tracks are obvious hits, and the other tracks set the mood and build toward them. In any case, I also own Oakenfold's ""Resident"" album, and even though its expensive its a better deal - it has a lot of the songs on this disc but does a much better job expanding a theme."
5,"Surprise hit, all the way through","This was given to me by a friend. Man, was taken in by each and every tune. Great high energy mix. each song has its own flavor. A bit similar to Orbital, ATB, and Robert Miles (all of whom I love). Highly recommend!"
2,"oaky, this was only Ok","Trance Master and former Cream resident Paul Oakenfold makes his US debute with Tranceport. However this cd falls in many ways. The songs were old and presented nothing new towards Oakenfold re-inventing himself as a DJ. Most of the tracks were a bunch of commercial anthems thrown together to introduce Americans to Trance music and Oakenfold. The mix was no mix at all but a bunch of songs put together.However this cd is perfect for a person new to the form of trance music. A person is introduce to such great anthems as Cafe Del Mar, Rendezvous, Greece 2000, 1999"
5,Great Trance with the Oakie touch!,"If you are a techo listener and are into Sasha, Digweed, Carl Cox, and/or Pete Tong, you should get this CD."
5,Extreme Oakenfold...,"Yeah, I know that the ""E"" word is an overused cliche, but couldn't come up with a more appropriate adjective for this work of Oakenfold. The CD grabs you by the unmentionables with the 1st track and doesn't let go. Sorry, but this CD is so great I have to write another overused cliche and say that if you could only own one Oakenfold CD this should be the one. It's perfect for any highway driving as well as 3rd shift or daytime commutes. It's hard to pull myself away from this one to catch the news on the way home from work in the mornings..."
5,Techno Excellence,"When I was being introduced to techno, this album was reccomended to me and it so happens to be the first techno CD I ever got into. Well, I loved it then and I love it now. I've been building up my techno collection rapidly, and this CD still remains my favorite techno CD. I've even gotten at least fair responses from people that don't like most techno. the melodies and rhythms are so beautiful and dreamy, enough to dance to or go to sleep to. It's great techno to listen to no matter what kind of mood you're in. This CD really got me to appreciate Paul Oakenfold, especially after hearing the original songs and hearing how Oakie remixed them. This album truely defines trance to me. I reccomend this CD to all music lovers, anyone and everyone."
5,Fucken Awesome!,The Oak man spins an amazing set; it's definitley some of the best trance/techno music out there. Note: for best results listen to CD while rolling or high.
3,a CD You'll Never put away !!!,Paul Okenfold has put together a masterpiece of trance/techno beats blowing the mind off of any listener. This is a sure cd to be listening to in your car but be careful of getting lost in the mind blowing beats or you end up losing your license. Okenfold creates the sound of the future and is a true artist. I look forward to a new cd by P.O.
5,oh GOD this is sick!,"Just got this CD in tonight, and by song 6 I just had to add my two cents. One of the best CD's I've ever heard by far, surpassing almost any of the 'techno' drivel out today. A cranial climax occured during 'Purple', and every song before and since have been good good yum yum. On a par with Northern Exposure, and WAY BETTER than John Digweed's recent melody-less release by Global. If you like trance, get it get it get it. Simply amazing."
3,Best Album ever!,This is the best trance album I have ever heard. Gamemaster(no. 10) blew me away (& up). A must for all ravers!
2,This is Trance From a Previous Era!,"Some months ago I wrote a review for this CD. I just want to add that trance as a music genre has undergone profound changes in the last several years, and most modern trance isn't even like this. Modern trance is closer to Dance. It's considerably faster, more sizzling, and more exciting, than this slow and boring mix that's not even well-mixed. So advising beginners that ""this is a great introduction to trance"" is probably incorrect and misleading. For a much better and more realistic introduction I would recommend ICU Generation Trance 2000 Episode 0.1, mixed by Kimball Collins."
2,Be sure you know what you get,"1. This is simply a remix album;2. There are far more creative remixers around (Reload, Aphex Twin);3. These songs are rigidly 4/4, based on the most predictable chord progressions; and4. They could have been written 10 years ago.My advice is: buy this CD if you need some background music for your weekly workout."
1,errrrr ...,This CD SUCKS. If your into enigma you may like 1 or 2 songs. The guy has some good intros i give him that but it gets boring too quickly. I suggest getting Trance Mission Volume 2 or Faithless. Don't waste your money on this crap.
1,I never understand.....,"How people can get into this style of trance music. The entire CD is just chedder flavored, with ""Gamemaster"" topping it off. I was somewhat ill leading up to the track, but simply laughed at that point. Personally, I've never been one to enjoy the ""now I see the light"" style of progressive trance, and this is what Tranceport is about. Certainly not a Sasha or Digweed, and not anywhere near the quality of a Christopher Lawrence. If you like this style of trance, check out Lawrence's Empire release. It's light, even for him, and just isn't nearly as cheesy. I purchased Tranceport simply because I hadn't heard a lot of Oakenfold, and I'm willing to listen to a few of his other releases, but if it's more of the same, people need to find a new trance dj to worship."
5,AN ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!,"This album is a must have-- you can listen to this endlessly, never get bored and never get tired of the sheer talent that it took to put this album together. oakenfold has outdone himself. if you don't have this yet and love trance, you should click on the buy botton NOW!!!"
5,Top notch,"Enough has been written already. This is one of the best CDs I've ever owned.EDIT, 2011. In fact, I'll go further: it is in fact the album that got me interested in trance. To this day it holds a special place for that alone and, even objectively, is one of the best mixes I've ever heard. I prefer the first half of the album, but one can just hit play and let it carry from track to track, and the carry is fantastic."
5,The world's most ecstatic and progressive trance,"This is the one folks!The number one trance cd in the world,and an ESSENTIAL masterpiece for any dance collection.All it took was one listen to this cd and I was hooked on trance.It just doesn't get any better than this,I wish Oakie would make more albums like this and stop putting out commercial pop garbage(with the exception of ""Creamfields"")This is the perfect album to get you beginner's into the awesome world of trance.Dont hesitate get it now!"
5,THE trance album to get.,"Hundreds of good reviews for this album aren't enough. This was my first trance CD, and to date, the only one I've listed to so much I had to get another copy of the CD. From car player to home player to PC, and even digitized on my MP3 player for superb work out music. Oakenfold and the Trace type of music are at their best here, even if the CD itself is several years old.Do not pass this one by, it's an absolute must have. Each and every song contains great melody, beat, a both soothing and pumping sounds that will move you. If you can refrain from tapping your foot, dancing, driving faster, or running harder while listening to this ... you're deaf. I couldn't recommend this CD enough and with over 90+ Trance, House and Progressive CD's in my collection, saying this one is the best means a lot."
5,Best Trance CD I Own,"I am a newcomer to tha trnce scene, and I was on [line] trying to see what CD's were reccomended. This was the most common album found on any Listmania list or Guide. It also was rated very highly by reviewers. So I figured that ALL of these people couldn't be wrong. So I went out and got the CD and havent stopped listening to it since!Let me tell you this, I don't know much about Paul Oakenfold but I'll say that I will continue to support him as much as I can. I got Tranceport last week, and I have gone out and gotten two other CD's already. I'm an unemployed 16 year old on a limited budget, and me spending this much money on CD's in one week is rare. But I do not regret my decision yet. And I doubt that I will."
5,Excellent Trance Music - All Good,"I just have this one CD by Oakenfold, yet my review is 5-star. I will shop for more from this artist. He seems to know how to create good trance music. All songs were good."
5,Excellent for a back in time moment,"Of course some of the pieces in this compilation have been over used,But If you are tired of the new trance coming from Armin's visions Asot series and looking for a less pop sounds,and a back in time moment you will love it.With its dynamic transitions and sophisticated melodic sounds this is truly the top 5 trance mixing/compilation albums in the world.When I bought this album because my old one was tape,I just heard some sounds I haven't heard in a decade and it made me get in a whole different state of mind and atmosphere.To even new comers and pop type non sense vocal ''trance fans'' listen to this album and understand where and how innovations where done to the sound of trance and understand the true trance.Cheers"
4,*yay* i love this CD,i hadnt ever even heard of oakenfold until i bought this cd... it was on one of those listening stations at the cd store.. and i listened to it.. and i just had to have it.. its a tyte cd and i never really listened to trance until i got it :)) now all my friends have bought it and they love it too... its all my best friend listens to now *over and over and over again! * anywayz.. its a good cd... check it out
3,Tranceport,"This CD is good, not his best stuff or should I say, not his ""personalized"" stuff. It's good, don't get me wrong. I was just expecting more from Oakenfold as an artist.Fluro and Perfecto Another World, were, so far, two of the best sets I've gotten of Oakenfold. This is just my opinion. I've enjoyed this CD, as just part of my collection of Oakenfold. I listen to this CD quite a lot while in my car. It's great driving or background music."
5,The Best work,"This was the first CD, I bought of Paul Okenfold. I knew then, that I had found a great musician. Now, I have almost all of his CD's, and I still think, this was one of his best work. In my opinion, if you want to know all about Paul Okenfold, buy this CD. THIS IS THE BEST CD."
5,"REALMENTE, EL MEJOR CD QUE HE ESCUCHADO","DIFICIL DE DESCRIBIR, PERO PAUL OAKENFOLD A MI GUSTO SIN DUDA ES EL MEJOR DJ DEL MUNDO, CON ESTE CD ME DI CUENTA LO QUE ES VIAJAR DENTRO DE LA MÚSICA, SIMPLEMENTE CIERRAS LOS OJOS, TE RELAJAS, PONES ESTE DISCO Y !!!!VAMONOS!!!, OAKENFOLD LLEVA ESTE SONIDO EN SUS VENAS, Y LO COMPARTE CON NOSOTROS.REALMENTE NO HAY NINGUNA CANCIÓN MALA, LA SELECCIÓN DE LAS CANCIONES, EL ORDEN Y EL MIX ES EXCELENTE, COMPRÉ ESTE CD Y AHORA QUE ESCUCHO OTROS UN POCO MÁS COMERCIALES, YA SOY UN POCO MÁS EXIGENTE A LA HORA DE COMPRAR, PORQUE ESTE CD NO TIENE COMPARACIÓN, LAS MEJORES CANCIONES A MI GUSTO DEL DISCO SON : ""GAMEMASTER"", ""THREE DRIVES ON A VINYL"" Y ""SOMEONE"", REALMENTE SI QUIERES COMPRAR UN CD QUE VALGA LA PENA Y NO ENTIENDES MUCHO DE ESTA MÚSICA Y QUIERES ""ENTRAR EN ONDA"", DEFINITIVAMENTE TIENES QUE COMPRARLO."
4,Good Trance,"Tranceport features good, but not great, trance mixes. Most are slow or medium in speed, and generally not to intense. If you're into slow, well constructed techno-trance, this album is excellent. The only truely ambient piece on the CD is <i>Gamemaster</i>, which would be a masterpiece of it weren't for the obtrusive dialogue that appears twice throughout the song."
5,The BEST Oaky CD ever....,I've been listening to trance and techno for the last 3 years and haven't come across better albums than this one....for all oakenfold fans....u gotta check it out.
5,My first experience-TERRIFIC!,"This 61 yr old geezer read about trance music in the New York Times and thought he'd like to hear some. So I ordered ""Tranceport"" on the same Amazon order as Nitty-Gritty Dirt Band's ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."" I love it. Great energy, ever-surprising variations coming out of relentless, driving repetition."
5,The King of DJ Mix CD's,"Absolutely Fabulous! The flow from one track to the next is flawless. Oakenfold's pick of tracks for this CD are tremendous. A must have for trance lovers, dance music lovers and for anyone who wants to get your groove on the dance floor. 73 minutes of pure delight!"
5,A journey into your mind...,"I am a dreamer of sorts who loves great synth and djing and I have a passion for techno. I just got Paul Oakenfold's TRANCEPORT from cdnow and I love it and I have listened to it for only two days. It is a trip honestly. A well blended out cd that moves from low beats that are slow yet inventive to the crazyness of track 10. Purple , and Gamemaster are by far the best tracks. I one day would like to be a dj , and a motion picture director and the way this moves with the ideas I have had they seemed to explode together. I thank mr. Oakenfold for the burst of typing I get when writting my movie scripts and listening to TRANCEPORT, and the way his slow tracks sooth my mind. A great cd. I am definitly gonna look for more."
4,A good read,"If you are interested in biographies from the Romanov family, this is a good one. I found Grand Ducgess Marie Pavlovna's books interesting. Although she did not show much insight into Nicholas or his family, this may have been due to the fact that Alexandra kept her family shielded from any of the family. But I did enjoy Marie's story of her life before and after the revolution. For a collector of Romanov books, hers is a keeper."
4,Wallet,I bought this wallet to hold all of the extra membership cards that stores give me. I am satisfied with it and think it does what it is suppose to do. I have not had any troubles with it.
2,"Book was a bit disappointing, yet there is value.....","I just received this book. I was expecting a ""book / manual"" that covered more than the most basic of information that almost all know. It is a good book, but........If you just want to know ""about"" photovoltaics from the standpoint of say, a high school student for a basic level science project..... this will do well. It gives the basic physics for the solar cell, the way they have been used in society now, and offer projected future uses of the same.If however, you actually wanted serious practical info, possibly building your own system, possibly going into a home Grid-Tie system, or other ideas with a little bit more technical and useful data, this book isn't it even though the name ""Practical Photovoltaics"" sound as if you would."
5,picture light,"Works perfect for us, easy installation, not as easy to adjust as I thought but works fine, I would prefer a darker brass color"
2,devon cream,"the product came part liquid, but a little gentle stirring made it whole again. My main problem was the expiration date it was December 31,2012. I recieved the item on December 3rd. I could not give it as a christmas gift because of this date. Remember also that this product has a long shelf life, so this devon cream may have been standing around quite a long time. I would not take a chance buying food from this company."
1,Very disappointed!,"I love to make homemade scones and serve them with Devon Cream and strawberry preserves. I was excited to receive my shipment of 4 bottles of Double Devon Cream, but upon opening the box I discovered the cream had become liquid in transit. I refrigerated immediately, but the product never regained the correct consistency. I feel like I threw away $27.00! Have ordered the same product from other vendors without this result, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Perhaps better packaging is needed when shipping to warm-weather locations like Southern Alabama..."
4,a useful companion guide,"I take issue with the Book News Review. Every birding guide has strengths and weaknesses, and few (if any) can compete with Sibley on illustrations. This book's main attribute is its standardized format that provides song, behavior, breeding, nesting, fight pattern, nest identification and similar birds for every species, plus a sighting checkoff at the bottom of each page. The comprehensive information makes it a useful companion to other guides. As for field portability, my reliable, dog-eared Peterson's still wins out."
1,Poor quality book,This book was in poor shape not what I would call a good quality book. It is almost falling apart. i had ordered a similar book from another seller and it was in beautiful shape. I realize it is used but I would have labled this in poor shape
5,One of the best,"If I were allowed to buy one record in my life, this would be the one. A bold statement. But this would be the one. Greg Graffin's socially aware lyrics and Hetson/Guerwitz catchy punk rock riffs blend together into perfect punk-pop bliss."
3,Stranger Than Fiction is strange,"In my opinion Suffer is Bad Religion's best cd. This cd is typical of Bad Religion to me in the fact that I skip through most of the songs. Bad Religion is one of my favorite bands but I think you have to ignore a lot of the crappy songs they have. I didn't like 21st Century Digital Boy in the 1st place, I don't see why they re-did it. I like track 12 and there are a few others I feel like hearing once in a while but overall I don't care much for this album. Suffer, No Control, Against The Grain and How Could Hell Be Any Worse are all better albums."
5,Punk Rock's Conscience,One of punk rock's best bands ever. Each album is better than the last and just as angry as the first.
5,The best of the best,I have never heard a band graeter then bad religion their music is sheerly perfect. It is the essence of punk.IT is simple and melodic yet refined. Their lyrics are nothing but intelligent.
4,"Good, but not the greatest","This CD has some good songs, but only a few of them are catchy. I especially like Stranger Than Fiction and 21st Century."
4,The best of Bad Religion is embodied in this album....,"This is the best of the Bad Religion catalog. It contains the high energy meets teenage angst that Gaffin and company thrive on. The songs are catchy and more melodic thadeliver social messages while not being too preachy or obvious that shows up in later albums. From the opening drawl of Incomplete to the final note of 21st Century Boy (their biggest radion hit to date) you get the tight and compact songs that Bad Religion is known for.Bottom Line: mainstream psuedo punk for those of who need melodies and catchy guitar riffs. The must have album for Junior High poseurs, wannabe rebels, and mid life crisis dads with the dillusions of bonding with thier kids."
5,Not the greatest but is a classic in my book!,"Alot of people think that once ""Stranger than Fiction"" was released, Bad Religion soled out because it was the first album they had that was released on Atlantic. In no way did they sell out. This album still stands strong just as any Bad Religion album. This is in every way an awesome cd, I don't care what anybody else says. This is a classic in my book. The album is awesome and contains great tunes such as: ""Incomplete"", ""Leave mine to me"", ""Stranger than Fiction"", ""Tiny Voices"", ""The Handshake"", ""Better off Dead"", ""Infected"", ""Hooray for me"", ""Slumber"", ""Marked"", and the surley a classic ""21st Century(Digital Boy)"". Surley an awesome album, and a Classic in my book."
5,Excellence,"One of the finest punk albums ever. No, one of the finest albums ever, period. This album kicks so much a** that after listening you end up with negative a** because it kicked more a** than you actually had to begin with. (Edited for content guidlines.) If you have ears to hear with you owe it to yourself to buy this album."
1,Actually I give this 5 stars,"I always look at the negative reviews first, so if you are reading this, then I assume that you do the same.I judge a music album by 3 criteria....does it blow my hair back the first few times I listen to it?, do I skip tracks, or listen to the album through?, and can it stand the test of time?The first time I heard this album was 13 years ago. I was 14 at the time. It totally blew my hair back, and I couldnt stop listening to it. No tracks were skipped (ok, maybe just `television`)13 years later, and probably about 80 other ``punk`` albums owned and thouroughly listened to, I have not gotten tired of this album. This is in my top 5 best punk albums I have ever listened to.Bad religion has MANY other great albums and songs, dont get me wrong, but by the criteria I set above, this album satisfies those requirements.I just love this album."
3,not their best,"I got stranger than fiction, but for some reason I can't get into the album as I can with earlier bad religion albums. The bands seems to have lost its edge that it had before when it was epitaph. The music lacks the previous energy and taught that marked previous albums. If you're looking for bad religion, go look at albums like all ages."
3,bad religion,this is not there best cd but the songs aree alwrite but it dos have the hit 21st century digitle boy.
2,I wish this album was only fiction,"As much as I love Bad Religion, I hate this album. Compared to such classics as How could Hell..., Suffer, No Control, and Against the Grain, Stranger than Fiction is pretty weak. While it may appeal to the fans of Rolling Stone and Newsweek, loyal fans who haven't heard this album will be sorely disappointed. Not only is the tempo slowed down considerably, the songwriting is subpar. While their lyrics are normally enhanced by the large words used by Greg Graffin, on Stranger Than Fiction, they're pretty cumbersome (see the song ""Tiny Voices""). There were high points on this album, but even classic cuts such as Marked and Inner Logic couldn't help but be drowned in a sea of dreck like Hooray for me and the album's title track. I'm writing this after they released The Gray Race and No Substance, which were also pretty weak. It seems to me that Bad Religion is merely going through the motion to produce new albums without much enthusiasm."
1,from best to worst,"at one point in their careers Bad Religion was the preeminent rock band of the genre. It is for this reason it is so sad that they have slipped this far. Most true fans of the old Bad Religion cannot even listen to this album, or any of the albums since Against the Grain. One star is not a low enough rating. It is sad to see what major labels do to some bands."
3,"Good music, but................","Lyrics at times seem way too negative and childish. The music in general is good, but I don't care much for the singer thinking he knows everything. He knows nothing, but what he learned in a book in college, which mommy and daddy probably paid his way through. The singer should be deported out of the U.S if he thinks so low of this country along with that one band who singer I swear sounds gay, NOFX. Maybe he'd change his childish brain dead mind if he realized how worse other countries are. If you want real hardcore punk without the winning and complaining that the USA is no good check out Sick Of It All or even H20."
4,could be better,not the best scc album but for true hardcore fans they should get this I prefer random violence.
1,Oily,"Made me breakout because this product contains oil. Love Korres Lip Butters, but did not like this. I recommend Cosmedix Lightening Serum instead."
5,WILD ROSE CREAM,"Delightful smell, I love how it feels on my skin, a very good product!! I recommend this product very highly!!"
3,"Not as ""Natural"" as Advertised","I selected this product because it was paraben free and I believed it was made by a more natural company than most. And I really liked it---it did a good job. But I recently saw that it received a 5 on the environmental working group's skin deep database (0 being the best, 10 being the worst), which for the price is quite terrible. The highest risks were for allergens/immunotoxicity and developmental/reproductive toxicity. ([...])I really felt duped about its ""natural"" claims. However, same database gives the Korres Wild Rose Facial Serum a zero. Since I thought this product did a good job, I am going to try and see if the facial serum has better results."
3,enjoyable,"i enjoyed watching this film, not what i was hoping for, but a great story. i found myself invested in the film about 15 minutes into it"
5,"Excellent acting, great story.","I saw this film several years ago at a screening in New York. I still remember its poignant portrayal of Chicago in the mid 1990s, of unrequited love, and of the absurdity of the lives of its two protagonists. Mr. Rosen and Pritikin are also extraordinary physical comedians. This is a gem you won't want to miss."
3,Revealing,Interesting and revealing. Gave insight into how the Jewish people were not understood and under estimated for their strength in their beliefs. This frightened intruders into their land.
4,The true and bloody story of Hanukkah,"I remember being really taken with this book when I read it as a kid, so I found a used copy to read to my kids. We make a big deal of Hanukkah so that Jewish kids don't feel gypped compared to everyone else, but hardly anyone really knows the story of Hanukkah in all its graphic detail. We should not shrink from telling our kids this story, and Fast's book is the only popular book I know that does it. The kids will not only have a better appreciation of the meaning of this holiday, but will also have a better appreciation of current events."
5,Amazing!,Brune Hogarth was one of the best illustrators to ever draw Tarzan. This book is a MUST HAVE for Hogarth fans.
5,The 80's Live!,Only one other review? Come on people! This album rocks...unfortunately it got lost in the shuffle. Pick up this record and the two ARCADE albums and you will be transported back in time.
4,best britny fox cd to date,"well i have the first two b f cd's & dizzy dean just didnt have the throat my ears were dying to hear. along came tommy paris what a screamer! he completly blows away dizzy dean....my favorite track is ....louder... what a great rock n roll song & the new singer just kicks ass, im surprised this cd didnt set the band on fire by the time it did come out it was too late for britny fox. the worst part of britny fox was the hair. michael kelly smith was that a wig or what? the drummer was never to impressive great guitar work & riffs. pounding bass lines.....guitar solos were screaching, some of the best guitar work ive heard. the cd high point the arrival of a new singer."
3,not as good as the older albums..,"Cant put my ginger on where they were trying to go with this album, think maybe they thought too much and put no emotion in the album.."
1,Because....,I gave this game 1 star beacause THEY DON'T MAKE IT FOR GAMECUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,LOVE IT,THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED....I LOVE HOW IT TAKES THE OLD MONSTER CHARACTERS AND FUSES THEM INTO THE SWEET GAME THAT IS VA HELSING....THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS IT IS A SHORT GAME I REQUEST U RENT IT.
2,Van.....NO,"This game was too easy overall, the puzzles were too easy, and the bosses were too easy to beat. When I had beaten it was like ""is that it?"" At the end I thought I was going to be able to fight Dracula as the werewolf like he did in the movie but I was sadly disappointed. It only took about 3 hours too beat. I don't recommend anyone waste their money on this game."
4,Its all good,"Ok, The Movie Van Helsin was awsome, the game is ok 2, the graphics suck, but its still a good game, u get awsome weapons and fight the dead, what more can u ask for? though the game kicks, i recomend renting it because its a lil short."
3,Not a Great Chose,The game was pretty fun but way to short. At the end you don't even get to fight as a werewolf. I beat the game in 2 days so i would recamend renting it over buying it.
3,It was OK,I bought this game because I loved the movie and I thought it world be like the movie. The game is kinda hard and took me forever to get past the Dracula Wives. I guess it just got boring after a while. I never play it anymore anyway.
1,THE MOST BORING GAME EVER MADE!,This game gets really boring really fast. I mean there's only like 13 levels that aren't that fun and the overall gameplay is just plain stupid and too hard!!!!!!!!!
3,I enjoy the game.,The game works fine. i would have liked it to have come with a memory card but othere than that i'm happy with the game.
4,Bodum Double Wall Thermo-Glass,"Great for summer. Keeps drink cool and doesn't ""sweat"" when the weather's hot and humid. Somewhat fragile."
2,"WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT DELIGHTFUL TO HOLD, BUT IF IT BREAKS...",we don't want to know. These glasses are way to fragile for practical use. There were a number of reviews where they were broken on arrival. Mine arrived alright and seem to be fine for coffee but do not use them with ice. One ice cube will break the inner glass and you will not know it while drinking as the very thin inner glass and the drink fall into the remainder of the glass. You could easily swallow some glass. You do not realize the inner glass is broken until you swallow some glass or finish your drink and see liquid still in the space between the broken part of your glass and the outer wall.I wrote the Bodum Company explaining the situation but got no response. I use other Bodum products and have never had a problem but these glasses and their customer service are unsatisfactory.
4,Great glasses but fragile,"I use these glasses for coffee only. I find them to be just great for preserving heat and also a perfect fit for the Sweet Maria's ""Clever Coffee Dripper"" (can be found here: [...]). No I do not work for Sweet Maria's. The glass is thin however and I would not recommend stirring in milk/cream/sugar with a metal spoon as it may break or crack the interior glass. I drink my coffee black so I have no such issue. So overall these are great glasses but fragile. 4 stars."
4,"Bodum Pavina 15-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (Tall Drink), Set of 2",Great glasses. Just have to be very careful in handling so as not to damage the inner glass.
3,Bodum Pavina,"It looks great and is nice to drink from, but breaks easily, just adding an ice cube broke the inner layer. I think this was stated in the description, I was careful adding the ice cube, but the inner layer is just so thin. I still have one left, and is great as long as I remember not to add any ice."
1,Bodum Pavina 15 oz double wall thermo,The item was received in good condition; however one of the glassesbroke at the base of the thermo wall and liquid leaked into the bottom.
4,Nice Glass!,"Keeps drinks cool- No condensation. Only one complaint: Too wide for small hands. Perfect for my boyfriend, too wide for my small (not tiny) hands."
2,"Really pretty, VERY fragile","I ordered these glasses (two sets) knowing they were fragile from the online reviews here. When they arrived, one glass in each set was broken. The packaging on these things is pretty bad.On the flip side, it was pretty easy to have another sent out, and since it was one glass from each set, they sent me out two new sets for free. Which means I got a free set!I will say that I still get condensation. I see that others don't have a problem with that...but I did. When it happens, it obscures the attractiveness of the glasses.As for dishwasher safe aspects, I wouldn't know. After reading the reviews I just handwash them. Not a big deal."
1,doubled walled trouble,"While the design is beautiful and sufficiently insulated, the glass walled structure is too weak to withstand normal use. Even when I avoided placing ice cubes, spoons, etc. in the glass, my Bodum Double Wall glasses lasted only a week. I don't recall ever having a problem with other Bodum products, so I am concluding from this experience that this is a very flawed glassware design from this company. In terms of quality control, one of the glasses actually had a pin hole leak at the base of the glass which caused water to seep between the walls. In a cautionary note, you need to return this item if you find any small holes in the glass, because the water trapped between the walls of glass will eventually cause the glass to explode."
1,"Great Idea, Horrible product","While I love the idea of insulated glassware, these may be the most fragile glasses I have ever owned. Both broke in less than a week.Try the Tropix or Tervis instead."
4,Don't cook it,Don't dry one of these on the top shelf of your dishwasher. Check closely around the rim when they arrive also. Coolest beermug in the world but a little fragile at the rim.Ed Hopson
4,Muy buen servicio,Una de los vasos llegó roto pero al reportarlo en seguida me enviaron un juego extra.Excelente servicio.Muy buen producto
2,Too fragile for everyday use,"We bought a set of 8 and are down to 1 two months later. If they tip over they will crack, and one broke while handwashing so this borders on a product safety issue. Nice while it lasted, but at $10 a glass it's not worth it."
3,"Beautiful, breakable","I love the concept of these glasses. We bought 4-tall and 4-short about a year ago. We have 1-tall and 3-short left. They are beautiful and coffee stays warm, but be careful. These glasses don't just break...they shatter!! One other thing to note...if they do survive the test of time, the glass gets cloudy."
2,Not Worth It,"A few days ago, as I was putting ice into my thermo glass the interior lining just shattered. believing that the glass was supposed to be stronger than that I looked up the product online to see if there were any warranty details. I didn't find any, but I did find this editor's note:""Editor's Note: Because the glasses are mouth blown, each one may have slight variations in height, thickness, and weight. Bodum recommends using care when placing ice into the glass to avoid fracturing the inner layer. ""I love the glass, I just think they shouldn't advertise strength as one of its strengths."
4,Great glasses for wine,I haven't used my glasses for anything except for wine and beer and they are fantastic. I put them in the dishwasher with no problems.
1,Fragile,"Nice to look at, but extremely fragile. Despite taking extra care after ordering these from Amazon, both glasses broke within 3 days of usage. Even dropping a small ice cube into the glass is sufficient to crack the unusually thin interiror glass wall."
1,Cool but no thanks.,"I saw these in a magazine and thought it was a great idea. My wife gave me 4 for my birthday. Within 1 week the 1st was broken due to someone dropping an ice cube into it. I complained to my wife this was a poor design (they are also expensive), she defended them saying the guest must of ""thrown"" the cubes into the glass.Well my wife has changed her tune. The 2nd one broke about 3 weeks later. She filled the glass with soda, put 2 ice cubes in gently. 5 minutes later, she notices a hole in the bottom, and some loose glass. A glass you cant use with ice cubes? What a crappy design.I wouldnt want to be the one who has a guest over and they drink some glass. Lawsuit?At least if they had some mention of the fragility on the packaging it wouldnt be so bad.2 thumbs down Bodum.I predict these will be withdrawn from the market.Crappy design."
5,Bodum Pavina Dbl Wall Glasses,My wife enjoys these glasses almost as much as she enjoys the Keurig brewer she uses them with. They keep her coffee warm even when she outside on the porch.
2,Disappointed,"I have used Bodum glasses in the past. These, however, these are different as they had a plug on the bottom of the glass which allows moisture between the two pieces of glass. I am not happy with them. Lynn Moore"
1,Bad Product,WE are very unhappy with these glasses. One glass cracked after the 3rd use. I would not buy any more of these over priced no guarantee glasses.
1,Bodum Pavina Double Wall Thermos-Glass,"This product is not worth dealing with. The glass is way too fragile. Two glasses were damaged in shipping, another chipped the first day, and another shattered in the dishwasher without cause. They also did not insulate as well as plastic thermos glasses. Save your money!"
2,"Fragile, Beware","I had read all the warnings about dropping ice cubes into theseglasses prior to purchase. I still purchased and made sure not to use any ice or place anything solid inside. After the thirdday the score is one down one to go. Despite extraordinary caution I still notice the inner glass lining broken. There was very little liklyhood of ingesting the glass , but at 10 buck apiece you expect to use them more than twice."
4,No sweat glasses!,"These glasses ""sweat"" very little compared to a regular iced beverage glass. The only caution is to either be very careful putting ice in, or add ice after filling the glass with beverage. We broke the interior liner without realizing it, and could easily have swallowed the broken glass fragment! The beverage just flowed in between the two walls of the glass, so we didn't realize what had happened until we had been drinking out of the glass for a while! Rather dangerous ~ but worth it if you're careful!"
2,easy to break,"These are use for my lattes. Minor contact with other hard glasses will cause breakage. No warranty, most likely. I will not replace the two I have left after they break.I liked the product very much, the extra careful handling required is tedious."
3,Delicate,"Nice glasses but way too delicate. Man...I have to put these on the upper shelf w/the wine glasses and only take them out on special occasions, e.g. lady friend visiting. Prefer the tervis tumbler line. Plastic, double-walled and performs just the same. Does not look as nice though, but who give a crap if it just you!!"
3,Practical Glasses!,"Great Glasses. No sweating and rings to worry about. A little bit too delicate and a bit over priced. However, they are pratical for use when guests are over. Wouldn't recommend for everyday use."
3,beautiful but delicate,"What to say about these beauties...? I must admit that I find myself staring at them from time to time admiring their beauty, but these glasses are fragile little temptresses.I shattered the inside-bottom of one of them within an hour of receiving them. Learn from my mistake: don't use them with the ice-dispenser in your fridge. Because of this incident, I haven't tried cleaning them in the dishwasher.If you're comfortable with living on the edge a bit, though, these are great glasses. Hot stays hot, cold stays cold. Drinking from them is a pleasure and they look fabulous."
2,"good news, bad news","good:I love the efficient thermal properties of these glasses, and they are quite attractive, especially compared with steel thermal mugs.not-so-good: I bumped one against the side of the sink, lightly, and it shattered. At that price, I cannot replace them easily and would not buy them again, for that reason."
2,fragile glassware,"These glasses are very attractive, insulate beverages well, and I really like handling them. Unfortunately, they break often in shipping and are very easy to break by dropping an ice cube in from the top of the glass. I shudder to think what an ice machine would do to them. Definitely not for use by children!!!"
4,Very comfortable shoe,"I felt that this shoe was very comfortable especially for travel. While waterproof, the shoe breathed enough so that my feet did not get clammy. I wish that I purchased a couple of pairs when they were available."
3,More like a diary.,I was hoping for more detail of St. Therese's life. It reads like personal letters and the reader doesn't know all the references. Good read for developing virtue.
5,The Story of A Soul,"I have read this book five times and have taken different spiritual aid from it each time. She is an awesome nun and her work is so profound. I have read about 20 books on St Therese of the child Jesus and the HOly Face(The little flower) and I pray to her on a daily basis. She is my inspiriation. In Her short life, she did little things with great love. She is cosidered the greatest saint of our times and on the centenary of her death in 1997 Pope John paul II made her the youngest female soctor of the church. She lived her life simply and had a great love of the Blessed Mother and Jesus. Upon her death, she said ""I want to spend my heaven doing good upon the earth."" Also she said, I will send down a shower of roses from heaven. I keep buying new copies of this book and loaning to people and never getting it back."
5,Wonderful book. One of the most important for my life.,"This book did for me what St Therese siad she would do: Continue her work from heaven. This book began my ""reversion"" back to the Catholic faith.Great in its simplicity and deapth."
5,Story of a Soul,"From her own words, we can see how this important and popular Catholic saint dedicated her life to the unconditional love of God. Through a life of simplicity and obedience, she came to be one of the most revered saints in the history of the Church. The book takes us from her childhood to her death and clearly outlines her path to sainthood. An inspiring and uplifting book for someone who already knows Therese of Lisieux, as well as for those interested in learning about her life and her ""little way."""
5,A devotional classic is excellent introduction to this Saint,"This book is a great place to start learning about Therese. Includes the full text of the autobiography, and some supplementary material incl. a introduction to the autobiography and life of Therese and some of her letters and prayers. You can get much of this stuff online, but the book is a delight, with many pictures.Therese is a very special person, and I recommend a familiarity with her beautiful soul."
2,Six Drawer Storage Cart,"It looks nice, but the quality is poor. The drawers will not close properly since it slides out of the tracks when opening."
4,Crystal Galye DVD review,Deliverd on time and I am very pleased with this DVD.Crystal Gayle looks wonderful and still sounds greatconsidering how long she has been performong.The special material is very interesting and informativeregarding her childhood and family.
1,Save your money!,"The women are good-looking, I will admit, but the camera work is uninspired and technically deficient, and the bad transfer from film to video makes everything worse. I'd have loved to have seen these women in a good video."
2,"Legs are good, head is HORRIBLE. Get an El Carmagne instead","I bought this about 2 months ago. The legs are really good and strong, but the head sucks. It's very sticky (no matter how much you loosen the pan handles) so it's useless for panning and tilting. In addition, the head adds a lot of weight to the legs. If you've already bought one (like I did), I suggest dumping the useless head and buying another. The hook for the stone bag has already broken off -- and here's the kicker -- I've NEVER used it! I would buy a Velbon El Carmagne 530, 630 or 640 instead for the price, weight and ease of use."
2,Love - Hate,"I spent over $360 on a Monfrotto Carbon Fiber 190MF3 with a 804RC2 . When I was shopping, I also checked out the Carbon Fiber Velbon El Carmagne 530. The main problem with The El Carmagne tripod is that the head cannot be removed and it has no quick release plate to quickly mount my camera to the tripod. The height of the El Carmagne is also a problem as a substantial portion of the column must be raised above the intersection of the 3 legs to get it eye level . This will decrease the tripod steadiness. I thought after all my checking around I made the right move with by purchasing the Monfrotto 190MF3. It is a nice tripod. My friend bought a Davis & Sanford CarbonliteX10 for under $200 and it is just as good as my Monfrotto! This drove me nuts. I don't like the Davis and Sanford Carbonlite because I did not find in during my tripod search, or else I would of bought it and saved money!!"
1,I might give it to a child,"I was so excited about my ring purchase, until I received it. It looked even cheaper then I was afraid of, the stone was flat, and didnt even appear to be cz it looked like it came from a bubblegum machine. soooo disappointed."
4,One of the better Ultra compilations....,"Usually, these compilations end up having two songs that are really great...and the rest which are just either too cheesy or too heavy. This particular outing finds just the right mix of club/radio hits and bass-pumping techno tracks. Waxman and Latino do a good job of mixing it up....making the music light and fun. This CD set is a great addition to your collection if you are planning a party in the next few days! They pack in the most current club hits....just time for those late nite grill-ins! All we need now is a few strobe lights and a little bit o' the bubbly!"
4,"Not the best, but close","I'm sure that making these compilations must be hard, but Ultra Dance 5 does a rather great job. Many of the songs are really catchy, and playing the whole disc through sounds like listening to Sirius 66 for an hour and a half.PROS include the Tube & Berger track, which is incredible and cinematic in nature, as well as the Sarah McLachlan (her voice is incredible on this song), Kelis, and Tiesto feat. BT songs. The CONS are that the Lucas Prata song is in a remix form (the radio edit is about ten to twenty times better) and that, as is usually the case with the Ultra series, the second disc just sucks.All in all, this is not a CD you'll regret buying."
2,That'll teach me to make impulse buys...,"I saw an ad for this CD compilation on television and was impressed by the songs played. Not normally an impulse buyer, I nevertheless purchased this CD online, thinking that the rest of the CD would be as least close to as good as the songs played during the ad.I was wrong. The CD is a dog. Don't bother. The first CD isn't terrible, but the second one is almost unlistenable. It's just non-stop thumping. If that's where club-beats have gone these days, I'll pass."
4,Just as good as 04,"Ultra Dance 04 was my first cd in the series I heard. I never stopped playing it in my car. To and from work and even while heading out to meet my friends at the bars. I'm very picky with my music and I don't just buy any dance cd. Plus these Ultra Dance cd's rank up high in the popular vote and on the ""dance charts"". This one is just as good as 04 if you keep up with dance at all. Yes it dosen't display as much euro-dance in this one as the last one did (Benni Bannasi, etc) but I'd rather hear what the popular grooves are right now vs. what's fresh from overseas. If Ultra Records were smart they'd start a Ultra~Euro Dance series."
3,"Not for true music heads, but still pretty good","You aren't going to find any groundbreaking material contained in this CD set, but it is still decent and catchy nonetheless.If you are a true house/trance music fan, then you'll want to skip over this one. I'd recommend Danny Tenaglia, Sander Kleinenberg, and Danny Howells since their mixing skills are far superior and their music has much more of an underground feel to it."
2,I paid for this?!,"The first thing I noticed about this album is the fact that it's jam packed with really bad covers. I mean they are just plain boring.You have ""Love Me Right (Oh Sheila)"" which is a really weak sounding semi-different version of Ready for the World's ""Oh Sheila.There's ""Take me to the Clouds Above"" which is really just a weak vocaled U2 cover.There's the almost abominal version of Stevie Nick's ""Stand back"" with yet another weak vocaled female.Then there's the ultra boring cover of ""California Dreamin'"" which just needs to be put to rest.What should have been the gem of the album was ""Fallen (Gabriel and Dresden Anti-Gravity Mix)"" from Sarah Mclachlan. It features her beatiful voice over some beat and synth that make it almost unlistenable.As for the rest, I couldn't get this thing out of my CD player fast enough. You'd might as well throw the money for this CD in the trash because it's garbage."
5,Mary Poppins Eye Candy,"This little book is very PRETTY. Executed in water colors, the theme shows spring and early summer shades of green, gold and pink. Mary Poppins and the children are a little too perfect-looking to be like Julie Andrews and the actors in the film. However I love the images of Bert, and he does look like a caricature of Dick Van Dyke. This little book focuses on the surprise journey into Bert's chalk paintings on the sidewalk. There is a nice friendship going on between Bert and Mary Poppins, revealing a little bit of her human nature. Magical, cheery and soothing - it makes a great bedtime read."
2,Video non-broadcast quality. Informative though.,"Going for a vacation in Utah & Arizona in March, I bought this DVD to get info about Lake Powell. Having seen lots of BBC produced documentaries and working in the film industry, I'm expecting HQ video. This main video on this DVD is below broadcast quality and even has a few dropouts - that is not acceptable!Some of the extra material has better quality video - but seems more like a holiday video presentation than a professional documentary. Apart from that - it still offers some interesting info and history about the lake."
4,"Decent sound quality, USB connection woes","I bought this item because it serves three purposes:- docking my iPod and syncing with iTunes- charging the iPod- speakers on the goThe latter two functions work fine. The sound quality is decent for the size of speaker that is in the casing and for general outdoors use it works fine. The remote is a nice feature for controlling the volume mostly.The problem is with the USB connection. All the connectors (Audio in/out, power and USB) sit in rounded holes in the base of the unit and while the power and audio cables are provided with the unit, the USB mini cable for connecting it to your PC is not and it is extremely difficult to find a cable that fits into the base. That's because almost all USB mini cables default to a square rubber housing for the USB plug that doesn't fit into the round hole in the base of the unit.I'm still looking for the right cable or eventually will have to take a Stanley knife to one of my existing cables to make it fit."
4,My expectations were to high but I still like it!,I have the Bose speakers for my ipod which is big and bulky. I use the bose by the pool and it ROCKS with quality bass sound and volume. I wanted something smaller to travel with so I got this. I was expecting the sound to be as good as the Bose. My expectations were to high but I still like it. It does sound pretty good for the size that it is. It's very small and you can travel with it. I think the price could be better for what it is.
2,No way to adjust the sound quality,"Personally, I don't recommend the JBL on state micro. The sound is tinny and there is no way to adjust for more base, which is needed."
2,Distortion weakens an otherwise nice product,"This speaker system has many nice connection and navigation features but the sound is inferior to even a pair of cheap 20 dollar ipod speakers I have. I am returning them in the morning. Too bad, I had high hopes for them. I would listen to these before I bought them."
3,"Generally good, but no usable Audio Out","The Audio Out feature of this product is NOT for using the device with an external amp/tuner, ie like a regular iPod dock, it is only for connecting the On Stage to another On Stage micro. The Audio Out jack does send out a signal, but at too low a level for an external amp, ie you have to turn your amp up to the max to hear anything at all, also plugging the lead into the Audio Out socket doesn't turn off the built-in speakers like you might expect it to.The remote works fine with an iPod Touch, and the sound quality & volume are great, just beware that it is not an iPod home stereo dock that you can also unplug to take on trips, it is purely a ""use the built-in speakers"" device."
1,Poorly researched and mostly false,"Where to begin. There are so many mistakes and factual errors that it really shows that ANYONE can publish a history book. This book is akin to William Styron's ""Confessions of Nat Turner"" which is a white liberal's distortion of black rebellion during slavery. Hoyt acts as if Paul Robeson could not think for himself or that he was ""duped by the USSR"" and that he was politically naive. That it is a bold faced lie. No matter how you feel about his views , Robeson made his own political choices and was his own man. Intellectuals like Shaw, H.G. Wells and masterminds like Einstein respected Paul Robeson for his intellect. Robeson was a Phi Beta Kappa laureate, and an attorney who spoke over 12 languages. Martin Duberman's biography is far superior to this joke of a ""biography."""
4,All the Classics,"I bought this album solely for the song ""Memphis Tennessee"" because I could not find it anywhere else. Verdict: Worth every penny. Come on now, it's Roy."
5,Magnificent,"What can you say, about this collection. It brings together all his fabulous hits of the 60's, some 70's material and his brilliant late 80's material around the Traveling Wilbury's period whilst writing & producing with the great Jeff Lynne.A super collection of songs from a legend that should be purchased by all music lovers of classic rock & roll & pop music."
3,Not The Best At First,"To the average fan this album is not really what it seems. The majority of the songs are live or different versions of the original. I thought I was getting the greatest of his studio hits. If I knew it was going to be like this I never would have bought it. Although, being a novice fan, I got introduced to a lots of different songs and great recordings of old songs. But, if I were starting my Orbison collection today, this is the last album I would buy."
1,Not Platinum - more like lead!,"What a great idea - all the Big O's hits together in one place. But be warned... if you're a Roy Orbison fan and you know all the original music, stay well clear of this re-recorded collection. There is no mention on the cover of it's authenticity - it should be clearly stated that most tracks are not the original versions. Very disappointed!"
1,Amateurish,"This ""pamphlet"" - it cannot be called a book - is a homemade, amateurish product at best. Three or four pages of useless text in a fabricated ""question and answer"" format, and twenty-five pages of phone numbers. All info. contained in this slim report is freely avaiable on the internet with a few searches. This book is absurdly overpriced for what you get. It's more like a handout one would get at a free lecture somewhere. Try any of the other books on air courier travel listed and get some value for your money."
4,Illinois orchids in a nutshell,"Winterringer's contribution to the Illinois literature on native orchids is fairly useful to those of us who want to learn more about our native orchids. This small volume contains carefully-drawn line drawings for each species listed, brief botanical descriptions of the plants with their scientific and common names, general information about distribution (no specifics), habitat requirements, flowering times, and predominant flower colors. Two indexes, one of common and one of scientific names, makes it easy to find entries. One beautiful color photo as frontispiece and twenty-eight pages of black and white photographs add to the value of this volume, all of them by people significant in Illinois and midwestern native orchid conservation.For a more full accounting of all species present or historic, minus the line drawings and photographs, get Charles Sheviaks' An Introduction to the Ecology of the Illinois Orchidaceae, published by the same."
1,Bottoms falling off,"Having worn Birkenstocks for over 10 years, these are by far the most comfortable with the cushion insole. My problem lies with the fact that the soles of the shoes keep seperating from the microfiber shoe.I had them glued back on after only 6 months. Now they are seperated again after 6 months. There must be a problem with this kind of material not adhuring to the rubber soles. Don't get me wrong, I love these shoes."
4,I love MM,"This is my fave Marky Mark album out of the two, but then again I'm a HUGE MM/MW fan. Play LOUD!! Great for driving and especially for cleaning the house!"
5,Leviton female,Easy to install on 12 guage extension cord. Makes a sound and durable connection.You will receive what you pay for.
4,Great,"Carole King's ""Tapestry"" is an absolute masterpiece! No tribute album will ever come close to matching the brilliance that Carole puts into her own music, but ""Tapestry Revisited"" was a pleasant surprise. I must admit that I was bored through a couple of the versions of the songs (""You've Got a Friend"", ""It's Too Late"".) But there were some outstanding covers. Rod Stewart's, ""So Far Away"" is awesome! Love Rod's voice on the song. The best, however, is the Bee Gees version of ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"". The harmonies at the very beginning of the song are remarkable, and Barry Gibb's non-falsetto lead vocal is amazing. It's the only song on the album that I think is better than the original. This CD will be a wonderful addition to any music lover's collection."
2,Overblown and overproduced,"I'm a huge fan of the original. One of the key reasons is the simplicity, approachability and humanity of the album and King as a performer.The ""tributes"" are a mess, for the most part. I liked the second half of the CD best, but if I had to buy one of the two, I'd spend the money on a fresh copy of the original."
5,Brilliant cover of a brilliant album,"What a wonderful album and tribute to Carole King. Each and every song is given a special treatment starting with Eternal's modern r&b take on ""I feel the Earth move"", and ending with Celine Dion's ""(you make me feel) Like a Natural woman"". The highlight for me though is the wonderful Bee Gees rendition of ""Will you love me tomorrow"". But every artist seems to have a knack of making the song they sing, sound like it was written for them. A truly brilliant album. If you liked the original Tapestries, you will love this one."
4,Carole King a Favorite,"I am a fan of the Manhattan Transfer. When I was searching for them, this CD was shown. Also, I have always enjoyed Carole King's music so I ordered. I am enjoying the CD. Most of the tracks are 5 stars but a few are not so that is why I gave it a 4 star rating. I particularly enjoy the Manhattan Transfer's track."
3,Taprstry Revisited,"It doesn't come close to the real thing. I am a fan of Carole King, so it doesn't appeal to me like the real thing!"
2,Elevator music -- blah versions of King's songs.,"If you buy this-- listen to the songs first. These have to be the worst versions of Carole King's songs ever. It is just like listening to an orchestral version of The Beatles "" Back in the USSR"" in a store and wishing they were playing the original recording instead!I never thought I could hear a bad cover of ""You Make me Feel Like a Natural Woman"" until I heard the one on this CD. I got this used, played it once and tossed it back in the Goodwill bin."
4,The end of an era in group's long history,"This is the last whole album git.Mick Rodgers had been recorded,before re-joiningthem in 90's.It's really look like he is leaving,not interested doing this type of music anymore.Anyway there are the mid-seventies,music like that on albums ""Messin'"" or"" Solar fire"" is not fashionable,artists are looking in new directions.Manfred Mann's receipt for a succes (mixing his own material with others peoples good songs) is good.It will soon pay with huge hit ""Blinded by the lights...""But here we are-not a big hit( ""Spirits in the night""),some good music(instrumental)however not as good as previous album ""Good earth""(one of my favourits)Four stars because MMEB was a kind underrated band then (telling honestly album deserves only 3 stars)"
5,Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street,"""Baker Street"" by Gerry Rafferty has always been a favorite of mine and I was delighted to finally get it in CD format. The sound quality is excellent. Listening to ""Baker Street"" brings so many wonderful memories to light. I highly recommed this CD for anyone...Gerry Rafferty was an absolutely incredible talent!!!"
2,2 stars for 2 good songs on bootleg CD,"I am astounded that Amazon actually wants me to review this item. First, I got a bootleg copy of this CD mailed orginially from Eastern Europe and then from ""Little Odessa"" in NY. The CD case wouldn't even hold the CD right and it was crammed in breaking most of the ""teeth"" that hold the CD in and the case soon fell apart. The CD jacket had bad printing and was only printed on one side. It was obviously an illegal bootleg CD and when the ""seller"" insisted I write some feedback he was not at all thrilled about what I wrote. In all fairness I bought this CD for only one song and actually found another that that I had also really liked (the first 2 songs) and there seems to be nothing wrong with the actual bootleg copy so there ya go, buyer beware."
1,will induce vomit...,"Avoid this album like the plague... it begins with the nauseating ""Baker Street"" and only goes downhill from there. The only use I can imagine for this ""work"" is to drive hostage holders from their confines. Perhaps it should be mass-produced for the FBI for this purpose."
1,Not Pleased,"Camera works okay during the day but at night it just has a round white image in the view screen. I thought I might be getting a glare off of the crome on the back of the truck. I removed the camera and held it, pointing it in different directions, still had the glare. If I hold my hand up close to it, it will focus and display the hand but goes back to the wite spot when hand is taken away. I have a Pyleview backup camera system installed in the truck and it works well. I bought the second camera for a different view. The Pylview has 2 AV input jacks so I can toggle between the cameras. Personally if you want the camera for night vision I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Need a College textbook,Great introduction into strategic management. A lot of topics about global strategic management.
5,"Important classic, worth reading","In this work, Eliade explores the general approaches to initiation found among archaic cultures and how these have survived or not in historical traditions. While the work can in no way claim to be complete, it is a classic in its field, like so much of Eliade's work.Eliade utilizes a comparative methodology in looking for universal or nearly universal patterns in comparative religion. Here he looks at archaic initiation ceremonies in the Americas, Australia, and Africa, and compares these with India, Christianity, and historical Greece. The general parallels in symbolism and patter that he shows are quite meaningful and can help people understand related topics.Highly recommended for anyone studying this topic."
5,A classic on the subject of initiation,Anyone planning a initiation into manhood (or woman hood) or rite of passage should know about this book. It is number one most referenced source of information on initiation in traditional cultures. No one can say they understand the legacy of initiation in primative or traditional cultures without reading this book.Although it is a academic quality work it is very readable. The layman should have no problem understanding it. My only complaint about this book is that I wish it were longer.
4,He gets it,"I have every Back To mine in the series including this one,and this is definitely one of the better ones. In my opinion, the spirit of the series is preserved here in that the compiler is not in a hurry to prove to you how eclectic his listening habits are but rather strives towards a unifying vibe that lets all the selections hang together. There are some truly compelling gems here, and the dark vibe is sustained through the whole trip. Well done. The Richard X Back To Mine is very good, too. You will not be dissapointed in picking this up. It delivers."
4,Lamb fans ... Listen up!,"A solid effort from the DJ half of Lamb. Highly recommended for Lamb fans who also like Tricky, Massive Attack, Alpha, Portishead, etc. Mostly instrumental pieces, but the few tracks with vocals are well done. The tracks flow well and live up to the album's promise of ""a personal collection for after hours grooving""."
3,Okay for the Price,"I bought this knowing I'm only paying 3$ and I got what i paid for: what i received was a decent quality leather case that fits my Motorola V3 which is a pretty old phone that I still use to this day that i got way back in the day when it first came out. The clip that came with the case is very fragile and was indeed hard to install onto the case, I was afraid of breaking the clip while trying to attach it to the the back of the case, but once i got it on everything was okay. Overall I am satisfied with the product as everything came new and on time to me, thanks"
3,Leather case,"The product was okay and in new condition, but it was not all that I thought it would be. It did not come with a belt clip, so I have to purchase one separately.I really do not have a problem with that but I thought it would come with one."
1,Nice Scanner until Uniden quit offering Smartscanner ability,"I purchased my BC245XLT with the idea of being able to take advantage of using Uniden's Smartscanner Technology and downloading my frequencies based on my area code. It seems that Uniden has dropped this feature as of February 2002 and according to one of their tech support people, have no intention of bringing this service back. So, if you can find the list of frequencies and then have the time to set each one, have at it. Personally, I would pick another manufacturer that advertises and stands behind their product's features."
3,Only if you really need trunktracking,"In the handheld scanners with trunktracking possibilities world theres basically two options:... If you really need trunktracking then go with this Uniden because even tough its a ""cheap"" scanner it is still superior... to his counterpart, in most aspects. BUT if you dont care about trunktracking systems, DONT buy this unit. All Uniden handhelds scanners are built cheap and you can feel its cheapness all around. The material is poor and the sound, oh the sound its not good at all. In a scale of 1 to 10, sound is 5. This unit is easy to use, has a computer interface and its scan and search speed is very good. Its sensitivity is above average. But again, if you dont need trunktracking look for professional models (that in fact are not that expensive ..."
4,Great promise in a first album,"I come back to this album often and wish they'd done more. It has a unique sound and energy. There's even chords for people who want to play along printed in the booklet. Totally original concept.Reminds me of 'Sixpence None The Richer', 'The Primitives', 'Dream Academy' and other bands that were in that wistful post 80's groove. Snow Patrol years before Snow Patrol.The 'Dan Loves Patti' title track sounds like the opening to a film. Perhaps they'd have made a better soundtrack than stand alone album, but it's that kind of hook filled haunting sound that keeps me coming back. It's waking up on a saturday morning and remembering something you wish you hadn't said the night before. It's that moment of truth when things are going to fall apart on you, but hope remains.Can't beat paying the penny and shipping it's offered at."
2,Not much to recommend,"At first, this CD sounds promising. It reminded me of the Dream Academy, with lush string arrangements supporting understated, breathy vocals. Then, the next song sounds about the same. And the next. And the next...After a while, the whole thing sounds extremely self-conscious and contrived. The airy vocals start to grate after a few listens, until you want to scream, ""Let's hear some dynamics, already!""This album went nowhere, probably for good reason."
1,YUCK YUCK is more like it,"No wonder this turd didn't sell more 10 and 1/2 copies. This could very well be the worse, most thoughtless and irritating piece of garbage every inflicted on the dumb masses in the history of recorded music. And don't give me none of that ""well, you know it was just a concept album"" crap, holmes was trying to get paid off this turkey straight up and really thought he had something going on with this non-sense. i even heard he sucked up to tiger beat hoping to sell some units. pathetic. stick to the ufo's lame brain, this album SUCKS!!!!!!!"
5,Daughter loves this castle.,My daughter received this castle for her third birthday (although almost certainly not at this price) and LOVES it. Can't get enough of it.
1,very dissappointed because I was told after waiting weeks that the toy is no longer available and I did not even receive it .,I was so looking forward to giving this castle to my 2 beautiful granddaughters who love pincesses and castles and when I was informed that Amazon advertised this products and that it was not even available for sale and distributin I was devestated. Kathleen Smith
3,Not bad but could have been better,"I was excited to own my own copy of this book but upon recieveing it, it didn't contain the plates (images) the original had."
3,Over priced,I though that the hitch plug was over priced for what I received and I was very disappointed with the John Deere Hitch Plug
3,Just OK fit,"The item looks nice and is made of quality materials. The 3 holes provide several options, but none were perfect fits on my hitch. It leaves a little gap between the hitch and the flat part of the cover.Fits both 2"" and 1.25"" receivers. Does not come with pin."
3,A different take on erotica.,"The only issue I had with this book, apart from it being slightly underdeveloped and unbelievable, was that it was too short and left a lot to be desired as far as back story. Still, a nice hot read, very original ideas."
5,Hot & Steamy with lots of action.,Excellent book. This is my first time reading this author and I will be first in line for her next book.The excerpt from the back cover did not do this book justice. At first I was a bit turned off by the idea of exercise and weight loss in a romance book but this author pulled it off.Talk about one hunky guy and a very determined chick. But this book is 100% alpha male with BDSM to boot. It's hot and kinky.You definitely will not be disappointed with this book. If you like a man to be in control then this book is for you.A cover to cover read......
5,Sorry I had to return it,"The camcorder was very good quailty, but I did find it some place cheaper with a bag,and many other asserires. The return was very easy and smooth, I thank you Amazon.com for maken' that happen! I would order from you again. A.M.H."
5,Two Hands Clapping for the Zen Cowboy,"Step By Step is as good an introduction to Chuck Pyle as you will ever get...The album highlights his gifts for great melodies married to descriptive and heartfelt lyrics. The songs feature the strong and complex guitar fingerpicking and the relaxed but focussed singing that are Pyle's trademarks.These are visions of inspiration and resilience, in life and in love, with heroism, humor, and above all, humanity, as seen through a pair of eyes looking out from under a Stetson.To listen to Step By Step is to take a deep breath of a cool wind under big skies. There are songs from this album that you'll hear in your mind long after the CD is over."
4,THE AK IS A NEW BREED OF RAPPER,TIGHT BEATS AND LYRICSA METAPHOR KING WITH STRONG DELIVERYDEFINATELY OVERLOOKED IN THE RAP GAME
3,"3 1/2 stars nothing like ""fly""","this cd is only bad if you expected all the songs to be as mellow as thier single ""fly"". its hardcore in some sences. its got great guitar, and it's very origonal, so one sounds like these tracks. i recomend it just for fun, listen to it, you might like it."
3,Stand and Deliver - Your money or your life...,"I bought this TAPE when it first came out, and listened to it hundreds of times. Yes, it's very hardcore, but that's what Sugar Ray was all about in the beginning. ""Fly"" was basically the only song the populace liked, and so, ""Every Morning"" was born. Personally, I find it humorous that on the ""14:59"" album, the intro is this hardcore-metal thing, pretty much a tribute to their beginnings, yet you can hear them saying things like, ""Be nice to your sister,"" and ""Share your toys,"" that kind of thing, poking fun at themselves, but actually putting out a good message.""Floored"" is definitely not the Sugar Ray of today, but definitely interesting listening if you haven't heard it. I recommend keeping an open mind during most of the songs. For me, it usually takes me a little while, then all the songs on a cd grow on me."
2,"""Mostly crappy speed metal!""","Ofcourse I bought this for ""Fly"". Its a great song. But I was shocked because none of the other songs were that type of style. ""RPM"" is a great song too. I like the groove in it. ""Breathe"" is also good, but to me its not that much different than ""RPM"". The rest of the songs are crap. ""Stand and Deliver"" is a horrible cover of an old Adam Ant song. The rest is all speed/thrash metal, which is a horrible style anyway. There is no skill or beauty on this album. Thats to be expected though when you play speed metal. But the main problem here is that these guys can't even play it good, and when they do, it sounds like someone else. If you are the type of person that just wants something to mosh to and doesn't care about the musical value then this album would be for you. Other than that its nothing but complete CRAP!"
2,Lame except for Fly and one cover song!,"They do a nice cover and Fly is an incredible hit, but you might just want to buy that single. Buy this album only if you enjoy thrash/speed bands with a touch of punk -- otherwise don't!"
4,Floored is a Very Good Album,"Like or not Sugar Ray is a good band and Floored is a great album, that involves many different types of music like punk rock, heavy metal and even hip hop or whatever as featured is Fly, which by the way, is one the greatest songs of the year. You have to listen to this album."
1,I thought this was gonna be good...,"When I first heard Sugar Ray's ""Fly"" And ""Every Morning"" I thought that was what the CD was gonna be like that. But I guess I was wrong. It's just another crappy heavy meatal album. I guess I expected too much."
1,'Fly' not good enough to carry this one,"I thought this album might be decent based on 'Fly,' but it is amazingly garbage. The only song besides 'Fly' that I thought was good was Speedhome California, maybe because it talks about California and I live here. But sadly this album is not worth the $2.99 I paid for it"
5,Don't hurt yourself...,"when you listen to this! Especially if driving. It's pedal-to-the-metal rock-n-roll!! Much better than I expected, considering the only thing that gets airplay is the lightweight ""Fly."""
4,I thought this cd was pretty good,I recommend this cd. It's got good beat and Fly (with super cat) is awesome
1,This is just terrible...,"I've listened to this cd constantly for 23 hours now, and I must say...it's a piece of crap. And it makes me sooo depressed, I just wanna escape this world and go live with the monkeys in the rainforest tree tops...all thanks to Sugar Ray."
4,Floored,"The Sugar Ray Floored cd is a great album. My favorite songs on this album are ""Fly,"" ""RPM,"" and ""INVISIBLE."" This cd is some what related to the Offspring ""AMERICANA"" album. I think people should still buy this cd even though it is a couple years old now. The only reason I gave this album a 4 star review is because I was tricked into using my money to buy a 14:59 album. I thought the music would be like the normal alternative sugar ray. Not all that s club, and 98* pop rock. But its really what count on this cd's music. Now for the content. There's about two songs with dirty lyrics(don't let your parents hear ""CASH""). The rest is all clean. I would review this cd to someone who likes bands who sing all the pop, heavy metal, rock, rap, and alternative. And remember when you buy this album, its not the age of the cd that counts. It is the music."
4,"suprising, but good","This CD is nothing like what most people would expect from Sugar Ray, but it's not bad. Personally, I like 14:59 better, but since I do like some hard rock, I enjoy listening to Floored. My favorite song on the album is RPM. I've always liked the song, and was suprised and happy to find out that Sugar Ray sang it when I purchased the album. Other good songs on the album are Breathe, Fly (of course), Speed Home California, and Cash. Buy this CD if you like 14:59 but want harder rock."
4,What a Multi Talented Group of Young Men!,"Having purchased 14:59 first I had no Idea what to expect when I purchased Floored, I only knew that they did an excellent remake of Abracadabra. Well, I was surprised as to what I was listening to, 5 loud violent agressive guys screaming and swearing and carrying on(mainly Mark), but boy did I love it! I have read the other reviews of this album and found most people to either hate the sappy stuff, or hate the heavy stuff, But I really enjoyed both. One minute you could listen to crashing drums and heavy gutair riffs the next to a sweet harmony. I have to say that these 5 guys have had more then their 15 minutes of fame, and I hope they continue to test their abilities as musicians and try every angle they can. There is no reason to make every album the same."
3,floored is a pretty goods cd.,floored is a pretty good cd but its a little to heavy metalish for my taste. the words are alright though and there are a few songs i realy like.
2,Double the profanity and less originality to last release,"I never knew how horrible this album is besides the smash hits ""RPM"" and ""Fly"". This album is more devilish than the ""Lemonade and Brownies"" release. This is in fact the first Sugar Ray album I listened to and the profanity was so major (especially in ""Cash""). I also hated that each song sounded quite the same except the two smash singles. ""American Pig"" had quite desrespectful lyrics. My advice is to get the edited version of this album if you are going to buy this album because of ""Fly""."
2,Ryan's Review,"This rap/rock band with a dash of punk may not be worth getting. They got exposier from the hit single ""Fly"" (That crashed and burned because of radio stations over playing it) that landed them on top. But they are nothing like ""Fly"" they are a metal band. Their music is good but all will agree that beginings of the songs and lyrics are crappy,and make no sense. BOTTOM LINE- Pointless cursing (cash) and bad songs make this album almost not worth getting. Listen well and think hard before spending your money. Best song(Breathe)"
1,"5 Stars for ""Fly"", -4 Stars for the rest!","Avoid this album like the plague; get the new SR CD ""14:59"" - it is much more listenable. This album is terrible and devoid of any rhythm or songwriting skills. It's like having your head hit with a hammer for 40 minutes (but not in time). However, ""Fly"" IS one of the greatest singles of the '90s; selling this CD on the strength of that song is one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated on the public since Bigfoot and the Kennedy assassination. You have been warned! (BTW, I got a parking ticket while spending 3 minutes running into the record store to buy this CD which means I paid $45 for ""Fly"".)"
4,Real Punk Rock - pre sell-out,"Have you EVER heard a motorbike rev up to a guitar?Sugar Ray did it. I would love to be at a Sugar Ray concert now and watch all the bopper's faces crumple if they started to play anything from this album (except Fly). The album opens with RPM - an amazing, ball-blasting song when it's pumped up - then goes onto Breathe - kind of Nine Inch Nails styles with a live drummer - then Anyone - again, pump it up BAYBEE!! Fly sounds incredibly poppy compared to these 3 opening tracks - even though next to alot of the bubblegum out now it's a bit rougher around the edges. ""Speed Home California"", ""Tap Twist Snap"" and ""Invisible"" are my other favorites on the album - all hard and fast. If you don't want your happy, clappy, boppy illusions of Sugar Ray broken, don't buy this album. If you want something to pump up loud and really get into, this IS for you!!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SUGAR RAY RULE!It's amazing how you can get addicted to a band so quickly!All the guys are really talented (Rodney's guitar playing is the best!) My favourite song on this album is RPM.Then again, they are all great! all I can say is BUY this album if you haven't already.Keep up the good work guys!"
4,an awesome cd,floored is 1 of the coolest cd's i have i went 2 the phoenix feb 6 99 concert with my dad if u like sugar ray youll like everlast & 2 skinee j's who r on tour with sugar ray
4,"Good, hard-driving album","I avoided listening to Sugar Ray like the plague because of the pretentious melody ""Fly."" I could not have been more wrong about this band! Floored is one of the best albums I have heard in the last year. If you like mellow music, you won't like it. If you like to get your adrenaline pumping, this is the one for you. It also has an excellent cover of an Adam Ant tune."
1,This CD gave me a headache,Don't get the CD just for the song FLY. You will be disappointed. It's so much of a head banger I refused to place it in my CD carasel. I could not even listen to any of the other songs completely through.
1,Awfull,This CD is the worst album that i own. I don't know who would like it. I bought it because it had fly on it. Big mistake. It's horrible. Not even music
1,THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL,"When I first heard ""Fly"" on the radio I taped it and listened to it until I could get the CD. Little did I know that the rest of the CD was the hard rock stuff I cannot stand. This is no way to get fans at all, Sugar Ray!!"
2,"Tough guy rock, some good songs though, 2 1/2","Well, who'd of thought? The band who had the soft-pop smash hit 'every morning' had, two years earlier, been some shirtless tough guys going around bashing people to prove their masculinity.But the good points of this disc are a reminder of how good rap-rock could be, the sheer energy making this style so appealing... when it's played right! Like it is about half the time here. The other half is Sugar Ray are trying their hand half-baked joke songs that completely stink, unless you think a band's coolness is measured by how many expletives they can fit into one sentence.By the way, I think Limp Bizkit kind of imitated these guys a fair bit, especially around the time of the 'Break Stuff' period, for what it's worth"
1,An extreme disapointment.,"When I first heard the song fly on the radio, i really liked it. So I begged my dad to get it for me. Now I use that album as a frisbee! I listened to it and it was the worst piece of crapo i had ever listened to. Let me warn you...this stuff is no good. The only good song is fly and Im getting sick off it to. So a word to the wise...dont waste your money on this please!"
2,....,"I got this CD when ""fLY"" was out cause I thought this would be a good CD. But there is nothing else like ""Fly"" on it. The only songs that I like are ""Fly and ""RPM""."
2,Not for the faint hearted.,"If you think this is a collection of cute little ditties like ""Fly"", be warned: this disc is closer in sound to Limp Bizkit and other metal/rap bands. ""Fly"" is the one pop-oriented tune on an otherwise loud, rather juvenile album. Sorry guys, it gets a C-."
4,a great cd,"As the owner of Floored, 14:59 and their self-titled cd, i can easily say this one is the best of those 3 (yes i am aware there are other albums by Sugar Ray). Less pop-ish, but not necessarily ""hard"" rock, this cd is very intense and enjoyable if one doesn't mind curses here and there."
4,Great! Sugar Ray floors it!,"I bought this cd because of ""Fly"". Then I listened to the rest of the album and thought how different it was than ""Fly"", but I liked it. If you don't like hard rock music then I suggest you don't get this cd, but if you do then GET IT NOW!"
1,too bad you can't give 0 stars.,"When I heard FLY on the radio I loved the song so much I just HAD to get the CD. Little did I know the rest of it is hard rock and heavy metal CRAP! And right after I got FLOORED I got sick of the song FLY. Now whenever I hear that song I feel like gagging. And the other songs on the CD are ten times worse! Unless you are one of those people who like this kind of thing (heavy metal blasting into you're ears that some people actually call 'music'), take my advise and save your money."
4,Didn't know what I was getting into,"When I heard ""Fly"", I liked the song. When ""14:59"" came out, I became a fan of Sugar Ray. I decided that I had to have all of their CDs that came before ""14:59"". Much to my surprise, they had two, I only thought they had ""Floored"", but I also found ""Lemonade & Brownies"".This CD was totally not what I was expecting. It was punk rock. At first, I didn't like it. I would listen to ""Fly"", but that was it. When I listened to it all the way through, I found that even though it wasn't anything like ""14:59"" is wasn't a bad CD. In fact, it began to grow on me.I wouldn't say that this is my favorite CD, but I'm not going to get rid of it either. It's just one of those CDs you listen to every once in a while."
4,I JUST WANNA FLY,"If you don't have this, and you like Sugar Ray, get this. There are some other songs by this band I'd like to get an album of, but I cannot find them. What's that all about? Ah, well. Who gives a crap, huh? There are 2 kinds of ""FLY"" on this album. One is just the song, and the other, is with this guy in the song who starts it off and continues as the song goes on. I like that version, but then again, that might just be me. Peace."
1,Maybe I'm too old...,"I heard ""Fly"" on the radio and liked the riffs; but fortunately I was able to listen to the whole album before purchase. Perhaps I'm just too old for this sort of thing, but the rest of the album was pure noise. We call this the old bait 'n' switch: reel 'em in with a catchy tune, make 'em buy the album, and then perpetrate a swindle. If you're a drugged-out headbanger who disdains melody, then this album is for you. If you like Fly, you will hate the rest of the crap on this disc. Not worth spending money on."
5,Haha...,"All you people who are saying that ""Fly"" and ""Every Morning"" are better than All the Hard Stuff...I'm just hoping youre girls, cuz those are two really gay songs."
3,gOOD,"eS BUENO, LAS TABLAS de entrenamiento estan perfectas. Tiene todo lo que yo esperaba de este libro. Me piden 20 palabras...que boludez"
4,Great Introduction,This book certainly gave me a basis to build on and was very influential in my initial weeks of training. Highly recommended for the beginning runner who desires to know more. Easily understood and enjoyable reading. Highly recommended.
4,Delightful,"It's enjoyable if you aren't expecting a typical Hollywood FX or action flick. It's a jewel theif / comedy movie. The story and humor are entertaining by themselves. It's clear that this movie was made with very little money, but Christopher Lloyd, Christopher Lambert, and the production staff pull this movie off. JT Walsh is here too and delivers a flawless performance. But, it's nothing more than what it tries to be, which is a funny story about two dim witted low-lifes. Very Three-Stooges-esk. I give it 4 stars for doing so much with so little!"
2,Looks nice...,"I prefer mechanical clocks... maybe for sentimental reasons... and I bought this one because is looked nice. I like that it has a large face. However, the buttons started jamming intermittently right after I received it... and it sits on a shelf now instead of in my chess bag."
4,Suspenseful Romance,"I saw this movie on TV several years back and the story stuck with me. I'm happy to have the chance to own this movie on DVD. It's filmed in my hometown, Toronto. The main character wakes up from a coma and doesn't know why her family is so against her. She has a mysterious past that haunts her throughout the story. She's very vulnerable and it's nice to watch the love rekindled between her and her husband. The plot keeps you guessing until the very end where there's an exciting and heart-breaking twist."
2,Yes we have Bateman,I'm a man and I just wanted to see Justine bateman because I've always liked her. The movie was a little Pokey at times and they should have dresses our star more scantilly.
1,Another Woman,I never received this product it was cancelled and my money was refundedno explantion to why it was cancelled.
3,A Pleasamt 72 minutes times 4,A great introdution to comic strips come to life in the movies. This series of films (28)give B Movies a good name. They demonstrated the market for continuing series and provide the precurser to television and todays sitcoms. The shows are dated but give agood perspective of post war optimism and prepolitacally correct limitations. 4 episodes down 24 more to collect.
1,Avoid and wait for a studio release,"Don't take a chance on these discs as I did...wait for a studio release of the movies instead.Platinum has done the type of job which could be expected of them...poor.First, the transfer was made, not with the original films, but with the syndicated television versions of later years. Thus, each movie starts with excerpts from the movie to follow, and then with the King Features Syndicate opening credit sequence.The picture on these transfers are muted grays. Never do any of the blacks look black, or whites look white.WORST OF ALL, concerning the video portion....Platinum has elected to place a company logo ""bug"" in the lower right hand corner...just the type of nonsense that one buys DVD's to avoid!!!!The sound is equally poor...a steady stream of background noise appears throughout the movie, and the volume must be turned up to hear the dialogue.All in all, this is a set to avoid, regardless of your feeling toward these movies."
2,5* for the movies but Too much on one DVD: Quality Suffers,"Note: Partially similar review of Vol 1.They should have put 2-3 per DVD instead of five on one. During high motion (Dagwood running out the door late for the bus, or Daisy running to get the newspaper) you'll be sure to notice blocky video. I'm sure the originals didn't have that.Regardless of the above, the movies are still very enjoyable to watch and I appreciate the fact that they're available on DVD.Conclusion: Movies get 5 Stars and DVD production/compression gets 2 stars."
4,Blue hoodie,The hoodie was true to color and seemed to be true to size. It washes well. I would like to order another in a different color.
4,Nice experiment from Takeshi,Pretty interesting film. If you've seen Beat Takeshi's films then you'll want to give this one a try. It's not as mesmerizing as Hana-bi but Beat was trying something new and I believe he did a fairly good job. The sound track gives the movie it's emotion and it's really touching. My only gripe is that the entire soundtrack is composed of slight variations of the same song (theme song).
4,Surprised at Accuracy,"I've really enjoyed using the ""God's Word Translation Bible"". I continually go back to it when I come accross something difficult in the other versions. The latest thing I came accross was in Isaiah 58...kind of difficult to read in other versions, but it was made really clear in God's Word Translation. I'm surprised that this version has not received raving reviews...in it's accuracy and simplicity, it should be rated very highly. But the study version is lacking as far as a study tool is concerned. There are 4 study bibles that are tops ""NASB Study Bible"", ""NASB Life Applications Study Bible"", ""ESV Reformation Study Bible"", and the ""NKJV Thompson's Study Bible"". And it is also good to see the ""ESV Minister's Bible"" out. Using all of these plus the ""God's Word Translation"" I think you will find all the answers you need in understanding the word of God."
2,Did Not Last,"I purchased the HO reversing Christmas Trolley set, the same as the Main Street, except for the Christmas decorations. The trolley was only used for about a month each Christmas season and ran very well. Towards the end of the second Christmas season the trolley started to loose power. I cleaned the track, tested the trolley motor and all seemed okay, but it had very little power. When I attempted to use it this Chirstmas it would not run at all. I e-mailed Bachmann for assistance but got no response.Two months of use is not worth the cost.mavdoc"
2,Glaring errors,"A fairly readable, accessible book that is marred by persistent, glaring errors. The very opening paragraphs state more than once that Henry Tudor landed in Milford Haven in August, 1483 instead of 1485. Later the text tells us that Mary Tudor married in 1334 instead of 1554. There are other, similar errors. The kind of errors that can confuse and frustrate the casual reader who is new to the subject. This kind of mistake, which ought to leap off the page and fairly strangle an editor, calls the credibility of an entire book into question. Every fact you read makes you wonder: Is this, too, a ridiculous typo?I've read several other volumes by Ridley and enjoyed them. It's a shame this one didn't receive better proofing and editing."
4,tasty for a light dressing!,"I love poppy seeds so I picked this up. This dressing is light - it doesn't overpower the salad. I enjoy the slight sweetness from the raspberry. When its done, I'll definitely pick up another one..."
3,ITS OK,"I REALLY BOUGHT IT FOR THE JIMMY CLIFF TRACK""NO JUSTICE""BECAUSE I COULDNT FIND IT ON ANY OF HIS ALBUMS AND I LOVETHAT SONG THEY PLAY IT TWICE IN THE MOVIE IM GLAD THEY DIDIM A JIMMY CLIFF FAN AND STEVEN SEGAL FAN...BUT HE'S NOTGETTING ANY YOUNGER AT LEAST HE KEEPS HIMSELF IN SHAPEFOR ACTION FLICKS I WOULD LOVE TO BE HIS STUDENT FOR 5 YEARS!"
2,Best Parts were in the advertisements.,"While we chose this flick in hopes of finding a quirky independent flick, what we found was not very interesting or creative and unfortunately we'd already seen the best parts of the movie in the previews and advertisements."
3,Might have been better without the dancing,"Somehow, the dancing as therapy scenes were a real distraction for me, especially at the end with the guide onscreen.Otherwise, this is okay as light entertainment with nothing heavy to say."
1,Nauseating,"There may have been a deeper meaning to this movie, but I didn't get it.A female audience may ""get it""...but guys, it is not for you!I found it nauseating, boring, and was happy for it to be over.Mad I wasted $4."
2,Hilarious Screenplay,"Infinitely witty, clear path to the heart of the ideas. The character development seemed somehow incomplete, maybe cluttered is the word; too many characters with too little time to connect their dots. The storyline seemed ill prepared for screen. But the screenplay made it well worth viewing."
2,I guess I didn't get it,"I lasted 30 minutes. I found the characters, situations and dialog so effective at annoying me that I was sure it was intentional, but there was no payoff. It was just an ordeal."
3,Great idea but...,"I have given this toy to my son prematurely before Christmas because we are going on a trip. Anyaway, he likes the skate park very much. However, as an adult I see the faults that the kids don't care about. First of all, the park is very fragile. When you put it together it doesn't stand perfectly straight. As a result, when you launch the skater he will fail to jump high enough becasue the ramp doesn't touch the floor firmly, so there is a gap between the ramp and the floor. You need a very smooth surface for the skater to go straight up. Plus, one side of the structure is higher than the other. I have come up with an idea, however. I am going to use scotch tape when he plays with it to keep it down on the floor. The toy's idea is very attractive, it's a lot of fun, but they didn't think it through when they were designing it. My son loves it, so what can you do? Would I recommend it, maybe, if you are patient and try to figure out how you can accomodate its use."
3,"Good, but....","Although there was a lot of good information re the individual birds, some of the likenesses were unrealistic and didn't look like the bird. Further, there were not enough views of the individual birds to make a good I.D. in some cases."
5,Great Murder Mystery!!,This movie is a great murder mystery when a high priced call girl is murdered with a revealing video tape of her affluent clients.It's a must see!!
5,GOTTA HAVE IT.,"I dont understand why in the world bands like f.o.w are not bigger...Cds like utopia parkway should have a special place in history, listenin to it makes you feel better, just like that, these guys are very talented and I recommend it 100%...Sink to the bottom is a four note masterpice, mellow tunes and lots of feeling are mixed in this incredible album, better buy it. By the way MTV sucks."
4,their second one is better but still a strong cd,"I picked up ""utopia pwky."" after hearing all the buzz about it and I loved it (pick it up) Then I bought their fist one (this one) and it rocks though not as good as their second."
5,excellent power-pop,"that's it. everyone is saying the right stuff, except for that two star. if you like radiation vibe and sink to the bottom, you should like the rest of the album. it's not terribly deep, but it is SO fun. bouncy, happy, great."
3,A pleasant read but not for the serious collector,"This book is a pleasant addition to the world of pipe smoking, but is certainly not for the serious collector of high grade quality pipes. Positive points. 1.Several good plates of celebrities with their pipes 2.A good introduction on the history of tobacco and pipe smoking around the world. 3.A few good colour plates of Peterson pipes. Negative points; 1.No in depth study of the variety of different pipes on the market 2.No in depth study of pipe makers around the world and their specialites 3.No in depth look at pipe tobacco and tobacco blending 4.Very few colour plates of high grade pipes or freehands,-which is the most tragic. A book that equals ""La pipe"" published by Flamirillon has yet to be produced!"
1,dime store quality,"Bought these in amethyst as a gift. Complete JUNK. They looked pretty enough, but as soon as they had been opened, and my giftee went to try them on, the post broke right off! I was embarrassed to say the least! If that wasn't enough, a packaging list wasnt included, so I am unable to even return them. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Don't buy!!!,"This DVD will get 1 star. I should have known this DVD was gonna be trash. Amazon really needs to watch the false advertisement, because this entire DVD is in black and white, but the description says color. The footage is grainy and very low quality. The voices are distorted, someone thought it would be cool to chop and screw the voices. I love documentary's but this is straight trash. PLEASE BE ADVISED FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"
1,a complete disappointment,"This CD came recommended by a pal and I was so disappointed by this. This really isn't what I would call the ""surf"" music - this is more just long, droning hippie jams for older people. ITs not quite oldies but just like old people rock or something - like my parents would listen to. I was thoroughly disappointed by this - save your money if you are looking for surf music - if you want watered down Foghat with no singing go for this."
1,awful stuff here,"I was thoroughly let down by this. This is pretty awful stuff! Its pretty laughable actually - this band fails at merging ""bong"" metal and ""surf"" music - both are 2 genres that should really go away anyway."
4,Add this to your collection,"This band is one of the coolest bands around. If you are a surf rock fan, you NEED this. Even if not a surf rock fan, this album fits nicely into any intelligent music collection."
2,Easton sunglasses,"Purchased three. Way to small for my three 9U players. Too flimsy, all three broke in a week. I figured 20 dollars would be good for 9-year-olds, but I was mistaken. Should of shelled out more for descent pair. I usually give good ratings, but unfortunately 3 out of 3 sunglasses failed. I would not recommend. My players did not contribute to the glasses breaking. All three frames bent."
5,A Must Have for Hockey Fans,"The book is what it is. It's no great literary master piece, but for hockey fans it's the best. I remember checking this (or a version of) this book out of my school library when I was a kid and asking my dad about the ""old-timers"" I saw in the pages. Someone just gave me a copy of this book for my 31st birthday and I was as excited as I was the first time I saw it 25 years ago.It covers the history of the game and pays homage to some of the great founders. So for those of you who love the game, or have a kid who does, it's a must have. I can tell you in twenty years your son will remember going through this book with you asking if you ever saw Gretzky play, more than he will the new X-box game. Certainly worth the $(...) it will set you back."
3,locks not included,"Buyer beware!!!Locks must be purchased separately, of which 2 are required to secure bike to roof rack. Description on here is very misleading as it states ""The Criterium is also high security, with a double locking system for bike and rack""I bought 2 bike racks and discovered the locks were NOT included, contrary to product description. Amazon have undertaken to amend this mistake.Apart from that the product itself is fantastic, very easy to use and install, however do not consider installing with out the locks"
4,fits the Rav4!,"This rack is one of the few from Thule that fits the factory crossbars on the Rav4 and I would bet on a lot of other cars. Avoided the additonal cost and hassle of buying and installing adaptors or Thule crossbars. I got two of them and they were very secure and stable holding an older heavier bike with a child seat. Very easy to install and load/ unload bikes for a roof rack. This does not come with the locks, that will cost you extra if you want them. Also, the packaging is not good, one of mine arrived with a broken clip and I had to return it for an exchange."
4,good quality memory for a reasonable price,I took this memory card for my Canon SD 600 camera and as far now i am very much happy with it.previously i was worried about speed of memory card.but that is also very good and fast.so i dont have any complains.1GB card is more than sufficient for camera.in hign resolution and best quality image it stores 300 pics. and in medium quality it can store upto 1000 pics.
1,Too Small for the Camera,"I cannot adequately rate this product because it did not fit the camera that I purchased it for. I had to send it back to Overstock. My problem now is getting my money back. I did not read the instructions thoroughly and sent the item back without some required information, so not getting the money back yet is really my problem and of fault of Amazon.Com or Overstock."
2,SD Card,"I ordered two sd cards and paid for 2, but only received one. But the ONE I did receive, works well."
5,"Great Company to Order from & Fantastic Item to Order, BEST DEAL AROUND","Why spend more when you get a quality item for a lot less money here. If you're having to watch your money like most of us these days, buy this SD Card from this company, they send it to you fast and packaged very securely and Always check for your best prices on Amazon. I purchase from Amazon ALL the time, I don't shop on the internet anywhere else until I check Amazon out first.Terry"
1,BUYERS BEWARE,"I PURCHASED THE SANDISK 1GB FROM EEK TECHNOLOGY FOR MY CANON POWERSHOT A510. THE PACKAGE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AFTER BEING CHARGED $12.00 FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING WHEN THE ACTUAL COST OF POSTAGE WAS ONLY .67 CENTS. MY COMPLAINT BROUGHT A REFUND OF ONLY 4.00, LEAVING THE COMPANY A WHOPPING $8.00 TO STICK THE ITEM IN A BUBBLE ENVELOPE AND SHIP IT.....A VERY NICE PROFIT.NOW THE REALLY BAD NEWS......THE CARD SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. I FORMATTED IT, TRIED IT IN FRIENDS CAMERAS AND DID EVERY THING IMAGINABLE BUT TO NO AVAIL. WHEN I CONTACTED EEK THEY REPLIED THAT THE 30 DAY RETURN PERIOD HAD EXPIRED ( ONLY BY HOURS DEPENDING ON WHEN THE PERIOD BEGINS ) AND THAT I NOW HAD TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH SANDISK.THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS AND I WOULD CAUTION OTHERS WHO SENSE A ""GOOD BUY"" TO REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING "" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"".GLENN IN NOVA SCOTIA"
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"This is a $2.99(?!!!) item with a $6.95 shipping charge PER ITEM in fine print from some non-Amazon company. If you order 10 you will be charged $98.00, not the $40.00 which you would expect! Misleading pricing?? You be the judge... Personally I would prefer the item be offered for $9.95 shipping included."
2,Watch out for shipping,"I bought three of the bulk package cards for $2.49 each. I did not pay attention to the shipping, but just discovered Handling and Shipping was $24.42, first class in a bubble-wrap envelope from New York to Indiana. So the final cost was about $10 each! It came from Digital Media Outlet."
1,Cheaper than thou,I read reviews here and decided to go off of Amazon (Blasphemy I tell you) to a website called OEMPCworld.com. They offer FREE (in U.S.) first class snail mail shipping and disks at decent price. Paid total of (CA Tax incl) $ 21.78 for qty. 6 1 GB disks !! (my digital 8 track music recorder doesn't work with cards > 1 GB if u r wondering...
5,SD card,The service was fast and the product was packed well. I have used the disk & have not had any problems. I would recommend this product and this company.
1,Never Order from Blue Proton,It has been 17 days since my order was supposedly shipped and it has still not arrived. I will never do business with this company again.
5,AWESOMEEEEEE,This beats swapping out memory cards. 1GB is all that my camera would support or I would have gotten something bigger.
3,$7.49 + Free Shipping,"The product is shown as ""$7.49 + Free Shipping"" but the savings don't show in the cart. The product may not have the clear plastic case as shown."
1,buyer beware,bought 7 and seller didn't combine shipping charges. paid over $50 in shipping and they all came together in a small mailer. most did not work and lost some great photos due to not being able to read the cards after the fact. thougt my camera was broken but it was just bad memory cards. came in little plastic containers rather than blister packs. friend said since they didn't come in the blister packs they were probably used previously though they were represented as new. all i know is most did not work and lost some great irreplaceable photos.
5,Thanks,"This was a hard-to-find item, just what our Bushell binocular camera needed. We appreaciate find this item for our wildlife photography..."
5,Lots to learn...,"These articles are great. They do well in delineating the conceptual and rigorous frameworks of the subjects.Included are exercises (and solutions) culminating from the problem sessions held at Quantum Field Theory program at IAS.Physicists interested in the mathematical aspects of quantum field/string theory would do well to read these volumes as well.Deserving, in my opinion, more than 5 stars -- many more!!"
1,dance / alternative album,"I was hunting for Moth Macabre , the day I saw it on the Grunge List of Amazon. After A Year of search, I found it in a Seattle Store, But Man... was I Dissapointed.I expected a Heavy 90'S Grunge album , with Huge Guitars...but Instead I Got , at the Max can be described as a Alternative album with a Element of POP in it.. Can u believe it..The female in the Band spoils the show, by Wailing along with the Male singer ... in many songs....No Heavy Guitars...though throbbing bass ..my friends....Maybe the hangover of HAIR BANDS was not over for this bandThe Album starts off with some OK Songs..but Towards the end..You are left Wondering... IS THIS A POP BAND...A Huge Dissapointment.....DONT BUY IT....."
3,Not for white dogs (at least not male),I really liked the smell but I have a white dog and it turned him a pinkish color (washed out ok at bath time). If I had a female dog I would have thought it was quite cute.
5,Valid interpretations!,"First off, anyone that is susceptible only to extraverted readings of this music should look elsewhere. Jarvi's approach here is, however, perfectly valid, emphasising detail and nuance over a more superficial effect. He has a vision of these works and a great orchestra to help him realize it and together they succeed very well. Also, music has only a very limited capacity to describe the most literal effects,e.g. Beethoven's depiction of natural events in his ""Pastoral"" symphony, Honeggers ""Pacific 231"", etc. It's greatest purpose is the embodiment of the deepest feelings, the most meaningful experiences, and the most profound concepts that a person may encounter in this world yet not be able to express with words. On this level I find these performances more than satisfying. The sound is great, performances are flawless.As always, it's a wise policy to listen first before buying. Your local library network can help."
2,Nothing special,"Young Mr Jarvi enters a crowded field and shows that he is not really the man to make this music come to life. The performances don't suggest any insight into the lush afternoon af a yearning faun, nor is the sea as portrayed here something to be in awe of. A puddle instead of a sea. There is a distinct lack of personality behind this conducting, it sounds like Jarvi is beating time only. No emotional surges, no real festivities in the ""Nocturnes"". Listen to Karajan, Haitink, to name two, and you enter a different world. The surround sound is very pleasant though."
5,Tremendously detailed yet highly readable prose style.,"This was - excuse the hackneyed phrase but it is apt here - a real ""page turner."" Ketchum gave you the level of detail one would expect in a first rate history. In addition, he wrote the book in such a way that you got to know the principals as people and you cared very much for them and what happened to them. I found myself ""rejoining"" the characters each night and wondering what would happen next. This was both an adventure tale and a work of history all at the same time. Meticulously researched. I even read the endnotes and other material at the back. A truly exciting book. Thank you, Mr. Ketchum!"
3,Very informative,"Here's what I'll say about ""Saratoga"": I learned a great deal from reading the book, but I can't say that it was a fast read. Part of that is because so many of the starring characters in this story were not completely familiar to me, so I had to, at times, recall whom I was reading about. There were times when the book dragged a bit and I wish it could have been written in more of a narrative style. However, I'm very glad I read it because Saratoga is a campaign that tends to be glossed over in classes while the focus is on the respective primary armies. It was an incredibly important part of the war and Ketchum explained what happened and why we should know. I'd recommend it to a history student or buff, but not someone looking for a casual read."
4,A well orchestrated handling of a key revolutionary battle,"A detailed analysis of a battle that may very well represent the turning point of the Revolution. Key participants are brought to life and the inter-relationships of these individuals were particularly interesting. Many of the myths are debunked and the credit for what was a remarkable victory for America and a devastating defeat for the British appropriately apportioned. This, in fact, will surprise even knowledgeable readers."
1,Horrible,"This book describes the battle of saratoga accurately, but thats the only good thing about it. The book goes into way too much detail about irrelevant information and is destracting. It also goes off on many tangents that take away from the main point of the story. It could have been written a lot better. Personally I fell asleep a few times while reading the book"
3,Not As Good As Earlier Ketchum Books,"This is the story of British General Burgoyne's invasion of New York/Vermont in 1777. The maps are barely adequate - too few and don't show military actions fully. Ketchum's strength is his writing style which is fluid and readable. There are lots of interesting period details and interesting military details. Burgoyne was an ambitious braggart but he was also a soldier well in advance of his day, requiring officers to read military-related books and treat their men as human beings. His management of the campaign however was loose. Ketchum portrays Arnold in derogatory fashion, as vain and quarrelsome. Gates' inactivity is explained away. The actual battle is covered rather quickly in the last 100 pages; Ketchum fails to show the tactical picture very well. There is no order of battle or analysis of the battle. This work is not as good as Ketchum's earlier Revolutionary War books."
5,The price of our heritage --- fantastic read!,"In an age when 100,000 or 200,000 troops are needed for battle, when computers and stealth bombers have supplanted the powder, the balls, the cannon, and the sweat, Ketchum brings you to the battlefields where America was born. How quickly we can forget our heritage, how easily we can ignore the sacrifices! Beyond his desciption of the ""big picture"" strategies and the debates in Philadelphia, Ketchum leaves the reader in awe as he describes the American soldiers' battles, the marches, the indian raids, the muck, the oppressive heat, the fear, the motivation. This, and another gem of his, THE WINTER SOLDIERS, should be a must-read for any American. He rekindles the flame of pride in our American story."
4,"modern, but with all the soul of flamenco","When I was studying Spanish in Spain my teacher had us try to translate music every morning. When she put in Noches de Bohemia, I had no idea what they were saying at the time, but was completely taken by the music, modern but with all the soul of flamenco, and bought the album that day after school. As I came to understand Spanish, I only grew more fond of the album. Each word is just as deep and soulfull as the music. Especially Noches de Bohemia and Poeta en Marrakesh."
4,A Fun Read,"This is in interesting book and I enjoyed it a lot! The author tells about being an unlikely professor of Buddhism in Cambodia. His account recalls some amazing experiences, and close calls. He explains some Buddhist doctrines and distinguishes the different forms of Buddhism while still keeping it highly readable. There is much more to it, and I recommend it for a fun read!"
4,very satisfied,I prefer to wear Florsheim shoes above any other. The price you offered was too good to pass up. The shoes were very comfortable from the first time that I put them on.
5,Saw their concert,"Wow! I saw the Corrs' St. Patrick's day concert on TV, and I became a rabid fan immediately! They are one of the few bands that sound just as good live as their CD..."
5,"New, different, and very refreshing.",This band is very popular around the world except in the USA. It will be just a matter of time before they become a household name here. A must to anyone who enjoys music that is off the beaten path.
5,only FIVE stars?,"This C.D.desserves TEN!!!! the corrs are the best band to walk on this side of the galaxy!!!!!!!!!!! my faveorite song is ""Erin Shore"""
2,Shiny bubble--Pretty but empty.,"I was disappointed in this CD. I bought it unheard based on the comments here(my computer isn't set up for audio so I couldn't try out the samples). It's possible my poor opinion of this CD may have been influenced by the string of great CDs I've bought over the past few months. Give me Dervish, Solas, Deanta, Nightnoise, Sinead Lohan, but no more Corrs for me."
2,Corrs Disappoint,"I was hoping to be proven wrong when my husband said, ""You're buying the Corrs? Prepare to be BORED!"" but sadly, it was not to be. It IS boring. If you're looking for something mellow, bland and sleepy, this is your album. If you're looking for dynamic modern Irish music, prepare to be disappointed."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"5 stars! I don't think so. I was expecting the best and it wasn't even close. Vocal harmony was blah, lyrics amaturistic. I believe the group puts more into promoting itself than it does its' music. My Corrs CD is now at the local USED CD Emporiam if anyone insists on still buying this pitiful piece of ....."
5,This Is A Great Album--Period.,"The Corrs' debut album is a wonderful blend of Celtic sounds and pop/rock music. It's good from start to finish and the instrumentals are lovely. This is what confirmed me as a ""Corrs' fan.""If you want to check out the Corrs at their best, I would highly recommend this album."
5,Love the Corr's,"I absolutely love the Corr's on all levels....their music, their lyricstheir voices, their souls, their beauty. I am moved from my depths and know my soul has been touched when I listen to them.I hgihly recommend that you allow the Corr's to touch yourheart and soul as well."
5,My all time favorite,"This CD I have actually bought 3 times for myself (once it got stolen, the other time I gave it away), but I had to have it. I have also given it as a gift, because my friends loved it so much too. I have listened to it now and then for the last 3 years - it stands the test of time!! It's got it all - great vocals, beautiful ballads and up-tempo tunes. This family is talented!! Just buy it!"
5,a great album,"The Corrs really are artists in every sense of the word. They not only make good music, but they write meaningful music and harmonize them with a distinctive Celtic sound. These siblings have incorporated their Irish culture into the pop music world. The local, traditional Irish sound has been recreated into the global, pop sound. Forgiven Not Forgotten is really a must for serious music listeners."
4,Warm but snug,"I couldn't find any information on shoe size vs. Dearfoam slipper size. I finally ordered the Large Dearfoam (I wear a size 7.5-8 shoe). They are a little on the snug side, but acceptable. Only complaint is that when taking off, the inside heel area wants to come out, so I have to push the insides back in after removing."
4,warm,I like these house-shoes because it's like walking on a cloud and are super warm. the only problem with white is keeping them clean.
3,Complexity = deminished retearns realised,"Preliminary review:The system is fairly straite forward in concept but is quite complicated in application.My experiance in spiritual practice has taught me that the more complicated (externaly encumbered) a practice is, the slower the return is in realising its potential or real benifit & I am not one who requires instant gratification.IMHO, the usefull content of this publication can be presented in 4-5 pages - without all of the opinions or retotic. KISS works!Love you Paula dispite an apparent differance in approach...Nathan D. HaysReike IIPSI have not practiced this process to completion yet, ergo; the 'preliminary review,' so this posting could be way out of line on my part.I'll post the realised results upon completion..."
5,Tired of Waiting,"Every few months I check to see if they've come out with a DVD of Season 3. Lo and behold, today I saw a notice for advanced ordering. I put in for it right away, although I wish they would list the price so as not to get too big a sticker shock."
5,in need of a Hill Street fix,"Hill Street Blues - Season 3It's incredible to me that you can buy thousands of episodes of mediocre sitcoms and dramas, but one of the finest shows ever on TV is still largely unavailable. I purchased the first two seasons of Hill Street Blues as pre-orders and plan to the the same with the third. However, I hope that the DVDs are in better shape than the first two seasons. Both packages had discs that would not play in my machine. I think that Fox produced them on the cheap, because I've never had such an experience with other new DVDs."
4,none of these things sank!!,"What an excellent album. I hope theres more coming from them. Having a five year old daughter, everytime I heard ""goodnight daddy"" (from C'mon Daddy), it moved me (ok, a tear came to my eye). Theres some offbeat gems like ""Outdoor Type"",and ""Knoxville Girl"", and some rockers like ""Secular Rockulidge"" as well. My favorite is ""Hospital"". Does anyone know if there is more from these guys?"
2,Perfectly mediocre,"2 1/2Harking back to the days when alt-rock was still a buzz word, Dando never seemed destined to venture far beyond that dated aesthetic according to this '96 release. Between highly derivative, uninspired songwriting and the bland, dumbed-down eclecticism the album does not touch many raw nerves and just sort of coasts by in a time capsule of gen-X apathy."
4,Good value,This product was a good value and works just fine. The parts fit properly and they were easy to replace.
1,Screen failed in 2 weeks of use,After just two weeks of use the foil screen started wearing through and having sections of it fall off. When these arrived they weren't in the usual Remington bubble pack. They came in a small cheap unlabled white card board box. These are not the quality of the original Remington bubble pack items. I'm switching back to the origianl item I've used for years without problem. It's not worth the 2 bucks I saved buying this item.
2,Remington Replacement Screen & Cutter,"Item arrived quickly.All parts were packaged well and were in good shape.Unfortunately, my 4 year old screen and cutter actually cuts closer than does the new one. There seems to be a miss match between the cutter and the screen because the screen gets hot after a few minutes of use."
1,Not Quite Right,"Looks good in the Amazon pic and description, but it just isn't a good fit. The poor fit means it causes the razor to be very noise and the shave isn't as close as it should be. It's a big waste of money to purchase this product. Buy a different razor... that's my next move."
1,Don't waste time ordering this product,Product was NOT in original packaging and does not fit the razor as promised. I recommend that you don't waste time with this product.
3,Remington shaver screen and cutter,"The screen is fine. The cutter head fit my shaver fine but was very rough and noisy, so rather than wear down my new screen, I opted to put back the old cutter even though it was missing one of the end blades."
1,Generic Junk,"The Cutter Wore A Hole In The Screen After About 3 Shaves. So Stick With TheGenuine Remington Parts. They Cost A Little Bit More, But They Last A WholeLot Longer, And They Work Much Better Too ! Check Overstock Or Drugstore.ComFor Genuine Remington Parts. Their Prices Are Good."
1,blade doesn't stay attached,"I bought a replacement blade for my Remington SP 62 shaver. When the new blade was installed, it worked fine for a few days. Then it popped off every time I would remove the cover to clean the head. I have another Remington of the same model and it doesn't stay put on that one either. The old blades that I am trying to replace will still work. The new blade just pops off and is unusable."
1,Cutter-head for Remington El.Shaver (SP62),"Cutterhead did not properly lock on agitator arm. Inv.N0.:102-4685293-6836211In comparison my old cutterhead did lock on.I returned cutterhead for exchange.Did get reply from sender,stating thats all they have.After receiving returned item they will refund.I am still waiting for another e-mail from sender : Buy-it-Now-Store.com9940 Widmer Rd.Lenexa,KS 66215"
1,Wrong cutter makes holes in expensive foil,"There seems to be two different kinds of SP-62 cutters. The newer type (with the SAME ID number) cuts holes in the expensive foil. I bought one of EACH (carefully using the illustration as my guide) but instead of receiving two different ones, I was sent two of the SAME ones, and my razor was ruined. THE SMALL PARTS WERE NOT PACKED! They were just thrown into the box and allowed to rattle around for two weeks in transit."
3,"Good, but not memorable","I ran across this on ****** and downloaded the CD to check it out. It is a very fine set of songs, and the vocals and musicianship is first rate. But Beatles? One of the top albums of all time? No way, that's just silly. I'm not a Beatles fan, though I grew up with them, but I can hum every song off Revolver if you play the first note. I just listened to this and I can't hum anything. Pleasant music, but no hooks, nothing to grab onto. It always feels like they're about to reach one, but they never get there. The distance between good music and something that sticks is only a note or two, but it's a gulf as wide as the universe. The muse simply didn't live here, which is why this is ""undiscovered"". And will remain so."
5,Way Overlooked,"I thought even for Crowded House, it would be hard for them to follow-up 'Woodface', but they did it and then some. It'd be a waste of time to list the great songs on this album. CH usually has one song that doesn't make the mark - and w/this one it would be ""Pineapple Head"".But listening to the arrangement and production of the songs, it certainly showcases Neil Finn's songwriting abilities. It's no wonder that artists like Shawn Colvin cover his material (in concert) on a regular basis.'Together Alone' might be out of print, but I suggest you look for it and purchase it too."
5,Best Band since ... you know,"Best band, best writing, best singing. What else is there to say? From the sonic opening of 'Kare Kare' to the drums and chants of the incredibly beautiful and heartbreaking 'Together Alone' Crowded House provide a final badly needed dash of humanity to 20th century music. No one has done it better."
4,Sadly out of print!,"I 'quite' like Crowded House. Their melodies are great, and it's all very finely crafted. However it all gets a bit bland after a while. However Together Alone is one I can come back to. It seems to be the forgotten Crowded House album, however it is their best. It deserves a great deal more recognition."
5,My all-time favorate album,"Nothing can beat planting yourself between your speakers and listening to this album in one sitting. There is no filler -- each song is perfect with spine-tingling melodies, evocative lyrics and lush arrangements. As you listen to the music, you are taken to a private universe."
3,Its OK,Does what is supposed to but I wished it didn't pick much that much ambient noise. Still is ok for the money paid.
2,"Decent quality,but fragile","The product is moderately comfortable and the quality is about what you would expect from its price, but simply in taking it out of the package one of the pads broke off. Wires were exposed (though not damaged), and it felt like it was going to fall apart whenever I adjusted it."
3,$50? Really?,"This mic is very popular around gamers, espicially if you want to FraGTaLiTy's mic mod. This mic used to cost around $5 dollars. It's a great mic, but why is there a need to increase the price ten fold? I would just go with a Zalman Clip-On. If you have $50 to spend on a mic after $100+ on a headset and $130 on a mixamp go right ahead, but that is something that I will not be doing."
5,Modded into Fragtality headphone mic,I modded this mic into the Fragtality mod. It turned out awesome. I love this mic. The sound quality is good.
1,55 dollars really?,i know you guys have a good boom mic but 55$ really for a boom mic? do you really need to inflate it that much?
