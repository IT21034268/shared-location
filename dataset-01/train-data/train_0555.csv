1,Horrible Boring Movie!,"This movie (which I bought for a ridiculous price of 19.99) is the worst movie ever! It bored everyone in the house to the point where we had to turn it off. It was all dream sequences, and no action. The acting was horrible. Don't but it, don't rent it, stay far far away from it. I should have read the reviews on Amazon before I bought it."
2,The Movie Ends Up Being Long And Boring,"When I decided to see watch The Hulk at the theaters, it was because I had nothing else do to. I realized I could have spent two hours and fifteen minutes doing something else. The movie was unneccsary too long and everytime you thing you are ready for some great action the movie slows down again. It took a full hour to finally see the big green guy as well. The acting of this movie will not exite anybody either. It is fair to say that Nick Nolte does a respectable job as Bruce Banner's father. To my suprise Jennifer Connolly did not have it in this movie. Also, Eric Bana is far from special. The ladies also get see him naked, not completly though. At the end of the film, when we see the hulk walking around the dessert smashing things having some fun, the viewer would want to know what took so long see some action. Thses movie did not have much, it clearly lacked action. The bottom line is that it could hav been terrible but is far from good."
2,The movie doesn't work,"The Hulk is a movie by the great director Ang Lee (who again does an amazing job directing this movie) but due to a bad plot nearly all his efforts are in vain. This movie tries to have more susbtance and drama than action and killing. This seems like a great idea unless the plot you choose is so simple you couldn't even make an issue of a comic book of it. In the end the movie alienates itself from practically everyone because it doesn't have enough action to be classified as an action movie, and not enough substance to carry the movie past the slow parts. The reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the superb directing and formidable acting from Eric Bana (as the Hulk) and Jennifer Connelly."
2,Fell Off And Lost!,"I used this item once. The next time I went to play my guitar, it was gone! I'm not sure when and where it fell off because I never found it. I installed it correctly, but apparently it didn't grip in place well enough. Maybe I received a defective one that didn't grip as well, but for me, the experience was less than satisfactory."
2,Sounds like a good idea,It consistently falls off my instrument and does not hold the pick securely so I have to go looking for both so the dogs don't chew them into shreds. The Wedgie picks I use regularly but they do not fit into the holder. In the end it was a waste of money as I've given up trying to use it.
2,wedgie,"this thing is small. if you place it between the 3rd & 4th strings, d & g, it goes all the way down to the nut. too small. fine for an electric, where all the tuning knobs are on the same side, but too small for guitars with 3 knobs on each side. it will work, but not in the middle. i would not buy this again."
4,Wedgie Pick Holder.,It does exactly what it was designed to do. It stays on me gee-tar and does not affect the tuning or intonation. No complaints from me.Russ
4,It's a wedgie,"Not too much to say, it's made out of foam, made to slip between the strings, made to hold two picks. I have several of these, for acoustics and for electrics. My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged, still, it does stay on majority of the time. I do recommend this. My son's guitar teacher calls this a ""fancy little pick holder"" and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time."
5,Cool item!!,It's a very cool little item that works fantasticly! I've got one on each of my guitars and even leave it on the guitar while I put it in the case and leave picks in it. They stay right where I put them and the holder stays secure.Doesn't affect the intonation or sustain yet is simply made and reliable. Highly recommended.
3,It does what it supposed to,"No bells or whistles, just a rubber piece that holds 2 picks as illustrated near the guitar nut on the headstock. It works."
3,Mediocre product,"I was a bit underwhelmed to pay $5.00 for a little piece of rubber. Additionally, my pick has slipped out more than once. It appears that it works best with two picks, but I only use one."
5,the pick wedge,This item made my guitar playing more comfortable knowing i can retrieve a pick faster the searching around in my pocketor floor when i loose one while playing.
3,Designs of the Nineties,"I've admired Tom Tierney's work for years, so I bought this book to complete my collection of his ""Great Fashion Designs of ..."" series.Unfortunately, it is not among his best works. The dolls are not particularly well drawn (one has a huge forehead). The selection of outfits does not represent the best designs of the decade, nor the best work of the designers included. There are a number of pieces from labels which were not influential during the era (Adolfo, Nina Ricci, Arnold Scaasi, Bob Mackie, etc). Also, some designers are represented by dresses which are not the best examples of their styles (Versace, Gaultier, Alexander McQueen for Givenchy).One of the few highlights is a beaded cloak by Galliano for Dior. The detail and color of this illustration are superb."
5,Info that you need!,"very helpful, just what i needed and recomend any one with a motor that is in this book to get it. The price of the book would only pay for 1 hour of a mechanic that may only be an apprentice on advice, you can do it buy the book and save."
2,No Real Help,"I bought the book in order to make sense of Heidegger's excrutiatingly difficult, BEING AND TIME. After having read the first 40 pages twice, the book wasn't making matters any clearer. I don't know why UCLA's Simon Evnine said ""It will prove most helpful to students struggling to understand Heidegger's difficult work"". The problem I think is that he using H's terms without comprehensively defining H's unique vocabulary (in a way that those who aren't professional philosophers can understand). And furthermore, he doesn't inform the student of the relevent background philosophical ideas that, I think, are necessary to understand H's text. I checked out Gelvan's A COMMENTARY ON H'S BEING AND TIME (quite coincidentally, without having read the previous review!), and found it much, much more illuminating. I have a paper due in a week on H's B & T, and I'm sticking with Gelvan!"
5,Great book!,This was a Christmas gift for my son (a PHD student) to be used as research and Kiel as a reference. He loved it and was pleased with the great condition of the book! Would make another purchase without hesitation! Thanks.
5,A good read about a great cop.,"I don't normally read police procedurals but this one is an exception. ""Wallflower"" is by far the best of the Janek novels. It also has the least amount of sex in it of the three. If Bayer had left the better part of the sex to the reader's imagination in all three novels he would have done even better. This is a great read, especially for those who would profer to avoid Ed McBain and/or Joseph Wambaugh but would still like some balance in their mystery reading. If you enjoy the Janek novels as I have you will also enjoy the seven movies based on these books."
3,Good Police Thriller,"I think this is one of the better police thrilers of the time period. He defiantly has a good one here also. He just produces wonderful character driven stories that when they work (and this one does), they really grab you. The tension is there though out the full book. The story is very developed so much so that you see the crime sceens. Another thing about his books is that they do not play to the lowest common denominator for action books; he gives the reader some respect and expects an IQ over 70. A good book that is worth the time."
2,they ruined it,"A trial version of Links 1999 came with my Win98 SE disk and I really got into it (...this, coming from someone who hates golf!). So, I did some research and found that Links LS Classic is actually just Links LS 2000 bundled with about 15 extra courses...and, since Links LS 2000 is the oldest of the links series that's still supported by Microsoft's online gaming ""Zone"", I thought ""This is a no brainer"" and bought it.Unfortunately, Microsoft decided the way in which the ball is teed off was too easy in the earlier versions and made the proccess wacky, difficult and...not fun. Unless you like slicing the ball into the bushes every time, stick with any version prior to Links LS 2000 (including ""Classic"")."
1,?,You have this game for sale? I assume it is compatible with LS2000? Does it have golf courses to be installed on my computer? This add tells me nothing about the product. I must be missing something! I have Ls 2000 and am looking for add on courses. Is that what this product is? If so I would like to buy it and try it.
1,Did not work for my P15-S470,"I received the adapter and couldn't plug it into my computer (Toshiba P15-S470 from 2004). Figured I might have been sent the wrong item. Received the replacement and it still didn't fit.No troubles with Amazon, the service was great, but this item is not meant for the P15-S470."
1,Doesn't fit!,You will be told over and over this will fit the Gateway M520 or 7510GX which is the same computer.IT DOES NOT FIT!!! the gateway one made by Lite On does not fit either!If i could give it 0 stars i would because it's expensive and a waist of money and time to buy it!
1,*Frowns*,"I was sorely dissappointed in this product. First, it has an attachment, like a pair of headphones would, right at the jack that goes into your computer. It took me only a week to break it. For unlike headphones, there are three small rods that connect the attachment to the cord, and are easily broken. I would recommend just spending the extra 40 dollars and buying one direct from Toshiba."
3,Annoying fan in the adapter,"I purchased this adapter after a dog chewed up the cord on the original adapter. The adapter works fine, but it has a fan in it, which I find really distracting. If you're looking for a cheap adapter, it will do the job, but I liked the original one from Toshiba a lot better."
3,It could be as well Made in China OEM,"I was a little surprised by the above average price even for the brand (Toshiba) AC adapter. But proceed and bought it anyway because my laptop deserves genuine brand.However, nothing says that Toshiba actually participated in the producing of the item. Nothing says who did either. All I can see on the plastic cover is MADE IN CHINA noname nobrand.My laptop is expecting very precise voltage (19.2V I believe). gives it anywhere from 15 to 24 volts.It's about time and a half bigger than standard AC.It has a fan (you can't see it on the picture) which makes some background noise from time to time."
2,not a 100% compliant as listed,I loved teh design however the adapter was not designed to be pushed into the available slot. This was sold as a 100% compliant - IT IS NOT. I returned it the same day I received it.
1,piece of junk,This adapter does not work on the Toshiba A65-S126 AC Adapter. I consider it a piece of junk when they match a product and the item isn't what it is said to be.
2,It hums whenever I plug it into the wall,"I will either send it back or have to buy another one because the transformer hums whenever I plug it in the wall. Since I need my computer to work, I've been dealing with the concern that the product may not last too long."
1,Ugh,"DO NOT BUY........ D O N O T B U Y !!!!!!! Horrible! This CD is a disgrace to compilations, and Cash Money... I LOVE CMM but this CD.... Ok, the songs are good, but how od they fit 30 songs in a Cd? Well you may think it is some new technology, but Ill TELL you how... they take the songs and cut them about 3 minutes short each... yea, 1-3 minutes. This isn't a ompilation, It's a rip-off... burn a CD yourself!"
1,NOT worth your money...cheap piece of junk!,"As this was advertised as a keychain light, I'd expected this to be much smaller than it was. Just the light portion is approximately 3 inches long, not including the keyring part, which has this odd (hard to describe) swiveling action that is awkward and seems like it would break easily. It does not just hang and swing freely...it is beyond me why they would design it this way.As for function, you turn it on and off by twisting the base...but if you twist it a little too far, the battery compartment pops open, all 4 fall out, and the light falls to the ground! (At which point I guess you'd need ANOTHER light to find all the little bits?)VERY poor quality, badly designed item...and if that wasn't enough, it arrived broken! Since it is transparent, it appears as though the batteries corroded inside the item. So I cannot testify as to how well it lights up...but with so many other issues, it wouldn't matter how well it worked -- it's a piece of junk!"
4,Big sturdy Cookie!,"My 2 year old son loves Cookie Mau (my son's pronunciation of Cookie Monster). This plush is big, soft; feels and looks very nice. A minor complaint is that the eyes are hard and it would be nice if they were a soft material. My son was rather startled when the eyes hit on some flooring and 'clanked'. But according to my son this is still ""my favorite animal""."
4,Electronica Meets Drum & Bass...,"Mixmaster Mel's Irresistable Force is surely that! In ""Fish Dances,"" the music resembles a movie score for a film-noir. Unlike many others, however, ""Fish Dances"" is more moving. Powerful, smart, and provocative beats power this mix version of some popular I.F. hits. ""Fish Dances,"" and ""Napalese Bliss"" are intoxicating. The others selections on this CD merely pass the time.Serious music for those who have outgrown Portishead. A must buy for those who haven't."
1,Baby Gandhi A Peaceful Alternative Series,"I bought this dvd and not work for my toddler, she don't watch it, is like home made poor class video, waste of money, better buy Zen Baby or Calm Baby those really capture toddler attention and make them sleep."
3,Its Ok!,"I was too young to see the other Alien films in the theater when they came out, so this was the one that I saw. After buying the Legacy set and seeing it again I have to say that it really is not that bad. It has a completely different feel than the others and takes Ripley to a different level that I never would have imagined. Looking back on it should they have made it? Maybe not. But it was good to see an Alien movie in the theater. I always felt that Aliens was the best one. The android was a bit much in this film and a far cry from the awesome Bishop of the second film."
3,"Not as good, no!","But at least the monsters look good! First time (at the cinema) I was very disappointed - but the movie (as ridicolous as it may be) is entertainig and watchable - and far more ""watertight"" than Alien vs Predator, the so far worst one, this one at least is based on the same characters and origin of story. And the acting is not worse than the sockers overacting as a some-kind-of-space-army in Aliens.The first Alien is still the best!"
3,Half.,"Okay. Here is the problem with ALIEN RESURRECTION- the third act blows. After a solid intro and some great shocks and thrills (the underwater sequence was pretty cool), we stray from what really gave us nightmares in the first three flicks- the alien creature. We are introduced to what looks like the PUMPKINHEAD suit with some backlot water damage. Whatever they were going for in the last act of this movie failed miserably because of the lack of regular aliens. I can't even understand what that thing with the nipplenose is suppose to be. How can a alien give birth to anything but an egg? Bad call guys. And WINONA RYDER? Again, bad call guys. Basically half that it should have and could have been, ALIEN RESURRECTION had all the ingredients to be solid, alas it was merely one of those films that you can either pop in the DVD player or catch on cable for the first half and then tune out."
2,"Of the four, this ranks #4...","I have always been a big fan of the Alien quadrilogy. Actually, make that the trilogy. This 4th installment really seems tacked on to the first three, and should have been left in some writer's mind, not on the movie screen. It really brings none of the originality that the first three enjoyed. I would recommend renting this one only so that you've seen the complete set - otherwise, standing alone, it rates only as a passable alien/sci-fi movie. That they brought Ripley back from blood found on the Alien3 planet is really an insult to the audience - she went out with a bang and proved her character in the first three, this movie just regurgitates a successful idea in the name of making some extra bucks for the studio.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
3,Hilarious!!!,"This movie seems more like a spoof of the Alien films. I did not feel like I was watching a film from the Alien series at all.This is the first Alien flick I've seen that didn't scare me. I had seen ""Aliens"" first and even though it was more of an action movie, it was still scary. Then I saw ""Alien 3"" when I was 10; I came out of the theater trembling, maybe the theater was cold. Soon after that, I saw the first film ""Alien"" and realized old movies can be scary, too.Then I saw ""Resurrection"" and all I did was laugh. ""Resurrection"" is ok, but it just isn't what i would call an alien film. Three stars because it made me laugh."
2,just when you thought it could'nt get any worse,"As i am a major alien fan, i found this film by far the worst in the series[Alien 3 i liked quite alot aswell]. This film has almost nothing good to say about itself, and while i talk to many saying they thought alien 3 was bad, i disagree. Alien 3 is dark, scary and very gory, back to the style of the first film. The alien is also one viceous little [creature]. But in this film the aliens are totally boring, the underwater sequence very uneccessary, and the little addition of the ""half-human, half-alien"" at the end is more than a little bit stupid and will dissapoint fans. You dont care about any of the characters, not even our heroine Ripley or even of the supposed ""likeable"" characters. A real dissapointment, lets hope if they make an Alien 5, it will be alotbetter than this."
2,BORING!,when i rented this movie i expected to [wet] my pants from terror. i expected to watch a freakin horror movie! instead i almost fell asleep from this [bad] hollywood action. this movie is such an insult to all the other alien movies...buy this if you are an action-freak and care about no horror.
2,I guess it would scare 6 year olds...,"But it just isn't scary enough to be an 18 certificate. Also, the movie is confusing and, whilst making you jump a couple of times, is more funny than scary.I guess it's the gore and bad language that makes it an 18, but if you took all that out it would be a 12.The acting is good, but it doesn't really have a proper beginning or end.Rent PHANTOMS instead."
5,"a great sci-fi, horror film","The tendency is to make comparisons to the previous Alien films... But that's the easy way out! By itself, Alien Ressurection is a great sci-fi horror film with great special effects and great acting for this genre.Sigourney Weaver's returning role was expected, but Winona Ryder's induction into the series was totally refreshing and brought a different atmospheric quality to the whole movie.The desolation in space, the morbid emptiness, the alien horror and inevitable destruction... it's all there, and makes for a horrific, yet fascinating trip into the depths of an ominous outer space."
2,"Alien, even to an Alien movie!","This movie was so bad. It went into a totally new direction than the other 3, corny. This was also the Alien film where the supporting cast of humans were more frightening looking than the aliens. The best was the original. It just went downhill from there. I'd say they're at the bottom now!"
2,They really should have stopped at No.3!,"Easily the weakest of the Alien series, this pointless addition has little to recommend it. Neither the claustrophobic terror of the marvelous original, the breathtaking action of 2 or the human interest and devious twists of 3. Alien Ressurection is populated with profoundly unlikeable characters whom the viewer simply couldn't care less about. Even the lovely Sigourney's heart doesn't seem to be in it and she puts in her most lack-lustre performance to date. The only redeeming feature is the gruesome alien/human hybrid, but even that only gets a few minutes coverage. Overall, extremely disappointing."
2,Not an ALIENS movie,"Watch ALIENS. Then compare. Then wonder what the hell happened. Like the comment made earlier, this does no feel like an ALIENS film ( I am by no means an expert on movies, yet by the first few minutes of the movie, I knew it was being directed by some french guy ). The characters were more like caricatures in there one- dimensional acting, and they had a ""cartoonish"" aspect to them. Probably the most ludicrous part of the movie was the ""richochet"" scene where one of the guns-for-hire shoots his pistol in the air to hit the marine below ( totally out of place in the ALIENS universe ). It's saving grace was the way the movie potrays the ALIENS, in that even though a threat to humanity and must be exterminated, they still hold a loathsome beauty and grace that man can only pervert and never perfect. It's only unfortunate that this message is blurred by laudible parodies of evil scientists and equally inept military men."
3,Not too bad,"Like many have said, this movie is better than Alien3.Sadly though it just can't live up to the series' second installment,Aliens.A good watch none the less."
4,I like the alien movies,"I fyou like the alien movies ore anny scifi whit lot of monsters and GREAT effect thene you must se this,, i thinck its a masterpiec great scifi and great action mixed upp just like Rippley :) who is terific!! ,, se it in a movie theater ore in a dark room whit big tv and large speakers,, for a great KICK"
2,Yawn,"The worst thing about this movie was how much of it was predictable. I watched this with my son and long before the final sequence where the Alien confronts the survivors in the escaping vehicle (deja vu) we were both shouting at the TV, ""Kill Ripley! End the Agony!"".We don't even need to get into the ludicrousness of mixing human oxy-breathing DNA and Alien acid-blooded DNA. This is supposed to be a Science Fiction movie. This sort of unscientific crap relegates this flick to Independence Day level, without the action to redeem it. Still, it was better than say, any made-for-TV Sci-fi flick. Or any Sci-Fi Channel 'Original' Production. Though Babylon5 beats Alien4 hands down."
4,Don't set aside time for this one.,"As a fan of the original Alien series, I had high expectations for this movie. I personally believe this was a good movie, but it really wasn't what I had hoped it would be."
2,did they even try?,"now i like the movie, but the blu ray of this doesn't seem to be a massive improvement even in the least. it looks like 20th century fox just slapped the dvd version onto another disc and said ""hey look blu ray"". it's a very shoddily done disc and id be willing to say that this actually looks worse than the dvd version in my honest opinion. if anyone can tell me what's better about it than go ahead, but the picture looked terrible, just completely filled with grain. id say get it if you don't have it, but i'm ultimately dissapointed here"
3,"Interesting and fun, but could have been better","I'm not a huge fan of this film, but I have to give the director some credit in at least trying to fix what the last movie ruined. There was almost nothing to work with as far as characters or plot; the last movie destroyed everything.This movie has many action clichés, relatively boring characters, and an exceptionally weird plot. The new alien/human hybrid Ripley is reasonably interesting. The connection between Newt and Ripley is even connected in this movie, which was a lot more effort as far as character development. In Alien 3, they decided to kill the characters rather than deal with relationships and development.This movie is really entertaining for the first three quarters of it, until it goes really south into utter strangeness with the final alien/human creature whatever it is. As a whole, the movie could have been much better, but it could have been much worse as well."
1,Terrible sequel to ALIEN. I really didn't care for this one.,"I preferred the movie ALIEN to all of the sequels. I thought the second movie in the series was pretty good, but the third movie (set in a ""prison planet"") looked depressing and I passed on it. This one (4th in series) came on TV, so I decided to give it a chance. BIG MISTAKE! I liked the beginning for the most part, interesting characters, Sigourney Weaver playing her part well, etc. The second half of the movie had way too much gore and little story development. Yeah, there were some surprises in the story, but really this turns into a lousy movie. REALLY lousy! The final part with the grotesque, newly-born creature was both unnecessary and totally awful to witness, just an excuse for more killing and nasty special effects. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, maybe just to say I endured watching it? Please, let this be the last spin-off of ALIEN. Please!"
1,This is god-awful,"The story-line is stupid, direction is horrible and is filled to the brim with political correctness. There was no reason at all for the guy in the wheelchair. The guy with dreadlocks suggests that they never went out of style. This is the WORST film that Sigourney Weaver has ever stared in. What was she thinking when she produced and starred in this mega-flop that doesn't deserve to be on the list of Alien films? This make Alien 3 look like an Oscar winner."
3,Popcorn Movie,"Alien Resurection gets a bad name because it isn't Alien or Aliens. The fourth installment of the Alien saga is not that bad of a movie. It is only bad when you compair it to the first two in the series. This is a popcorn movie plain and simple. If you are looking for action and some humor, but wanna see something that isn't going to win best picture then look no further. If you want best picture then go rent Titanic or something. This movie has some major flaws in it, but not enough to ruin the experience."
2,TRY NOT TO REMEMBER THIS MOVIE ONLY REMEMBER THE OTHERS.,"1. This movie is unlike the others the others where great they should get 5 stars.2. When you cloan a person it begiens as a baby that ruins how the other movies where beliweble.3. Sigourney should be THE ONLY LEAD PART4. The aliens where showd to much and behaved difrently (started screaming like T-rex in Jurasic park)5. The white alien was wery wery wery wery bad6. Characters are boaring7. Ripley is now the terminator (Not Weavers folt shes a great actress)8. How can a person breath so long in the water.9. The alien started spitting assit out of its mouth10. Action scenes where boaring.I did not like this movie but i loved the others, allthoug it was okay when the scientist was watching the aliens but still the aliens should not be showd that much. I rate it 1 or 2 stars i guess just 2.(do not write enghliss wery well."
1,"Ick, Yuck",The aliens landing on earth would have been a better storyline rather than this garbage. Who told Ryder that she could act? She got lost in this movie--her presence wasn't needed. What a waste.
3,"This should be titled, ""Hey, it's better than Alien 3!""","A fun romp in space with Ripley and 13 of her closest friends. There's not so much suspense in this one, and it's less taxing to watch than Alien or Aliens. That being said, the payoff isn't as great either. A decent choice for fans of the series, but totally average otherwise."
3,Better then the third but that is about all.,"This movie well better then the third still can not live up to the first 2 Alien movies.The story again does not make much sense because Ripley burned up in the last movie and there wouldn't be and DNA to find.At least none that is mixed with Alien DNA.Another is ,since when can aliens spit acidic slime?They can spit slime to trap people for future hosts but never before could they spit acid.The only good thing about this film is that it has good special effects.Oh another thing is that the mutant alien is just a mean spirited freak.A poor installment to the Alien series."
1,Complete waste,"Contrived and boring film that milks the series pointlessly. Ripley without a soul is boring; Winona Ryder is totally unbelievable and silly. Ditto the new half-human offspring. I'm one of the few who thought Alien 3 was a great, high-gothic, entertaining departure from the established Alien formula. Ripley should have been RIP at the end of that one. This is tripe"
3,A Passable Sequel,"Not as good as the original, but then again: what is? Aliens. Aliens, aliens, aliens. Just can't get enough (text to okay this review, that is)!"
3,Not the worst alien film ever made.,"This film was good, but not great. It had some holes in it and the actors could have been better picked out. The film isn't a complete waste. I didn't like the ending of it, but see the alternet ending and thats pretty. This movie was a hell of alot better then Mars Attacks. Oh and Alien and Predator fans watch both of the seires to get ready for the Alien vs. Predator MOVIEcoming out in theaters Augest 2004"
4,The comic book version of Alien!,"This film is better than Alien3, just the improved cgi effects accomplish that. The practical alien effects are outstanding and very creepy.The hybrid creature birthed during the finale, is no doubt one of the reasons many reviewers do not even consider this to be a part of the Alien series. I agree the strange looking creature is annoying, but the fun moments during the rest of the film make up for that.There are a few cheesy lines and bad acting moments here, but overall, Alien Resurrection is an exciting, original, and fun movie."
4,Sadly Underrated,"I don't understand why this movie gets the bad rap that it sometimes does. I thought that this film had a very good storyline. I do, however, agree that they should have left that alien/human hybrid out of this film, but that being added doesn't make this movie bad.The story of Ripley being half alien is a very interesting thing. She can use their own techniques against them, and does. The Xenomorphs themselves looked fantastic, they look even better than they do in Alien vs. Predator; they are very detailed in this movie.I don't have much to say, but I do have to say that I did like this movie. It had the horror element and a few other ingredients I felt that were missing from Alien 3. I like this flick; it's a ok in my book."
1,Alien Abomination,"I can't believe Sigourney Weaver read this script and said ""Yeah, I'll do it!"". Easily the worst of the Alien films and quite possibly one of the worst films ever made. What is Alien Resurrection suppose to be? A black comedy or an actual sequel to Alien 3? Either way it fails miserably. The acting is atrocious, the story is non-linear and absurd and the direction is abysmal. Believe the hype...this movie sucks!"
1,"YUCK, just awful...1 star is more than it deserves","Stick with the original. I also think the under-rated 3rd Alien is much better than this. Forget the ridiculous ""Resurrection"", I never even got past the silly part where the ""new"" born-again Ripley proves she's a basketball star. Simply stupid. Even the upcoming ""Predator VS Alien"" couldn't possibly be worse than this. They should have stuck with the storyline in some of those Alien comic books that came out years ago. They certainly were better than this tripe. Plus, finally we'll get an Alien film without Ms Weaver. I love her, but we watch these movies for the Alien and her presence in these movies has been unjustifiable to me since at least Alien 3."
1,A Bastardization of the Aliens Saga,"I hate 90's movies, in general really. And the few that are good go pubically and critically unappriciated, but that's another story. I feel that the quality of our films are deteriating rapidly and I offer this movie as proof. Okay the sets and special effects were ""cool"", but they totally changed the character of Ripley and the Alien! Alough I'll admit I didn't much care for Alien3, at least it brought a logical conclusion to the triology. I ask all true Alien fans to boycot this movie before it infects and destroyes an otherwise classic movie saga."
1,"Why, why, why?","The original was great, the second one was pretty cool. The third was a little unnecessary, but this was way beyond pathetic. Same bloody scenes, same acid blood, blah, blah, blah. This is two hours of gore, bore, and snore. Sigourney...the plot is dead...spare us, please!"
2,Cheesy and poorly made.,"Wow, what a disappointment. Almost everything in this movie sucked, from the weak and monotonous set design, the overacted (but underdeveloped) characters, the predictable plot, the almost comically inept abilities of the military characters, the annoying musical score, the dumbed-down symbolism of Ripley as the 'mother' of the aliens (complete with a laughable scene where the alien looks at Ripley with googly eyes and almost says, ""mama...?""), etc.I had a sort of respect for the first two movies in this franchise for their innovative set design, use of special effects, etc. but the third and ESPECIALLY the fourth installments are just cheesy.I guess die-hard Alien fans need to see this, but for all others, be forewarned... this movie is a predictable and poorly made waste of time."
3,Alien Resurrection - Review,"I generally liked this movie, but the story reminds me more of keystone cops type of comedy rather than the movie I had hoped it would be. Slapstick this movie should not have been."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst either.","This movie was OK. It was my least favorite of the four Alien films and of course was not nearly as good as the two Predator films or AVP, but it wasn't all that bad. I mean, there were some fights worth seeing, and a few funny moments. It was cool seeing the whole crew kill all the Aliens and then rocket back to Earth for a happy life there, and I liked the iron determination of all the heroes. Plus, there were some gory parts worth seeing, too. However, there was just not enough of a plot, graphics, or special effects for it to be in my top movies. But it wasn't bad. Or great."
2,POINTLESS GORE,"In Alien Resurrection it just seemed like they ran out of ideas so the made this movie a gorefest instead. Like most other reviewers, I think that the first and second ones were outstanding, the third one just okay. I don't see the point in why they even made this movie- I think people went to see it because they were hoping it was better than the third one. Another case of trying to cash in on the success of the original(s) Instead this time we felt ripped off twice!!"
1,Uneeded and unwatchable.,"I am willing it belive that the only reason that Sigourney Weaver agreed to star in this is because they offered her much more money than she was given in the previous three. This was not needed at all. If they were going to continue the Alien series, they could have at least have done it right. This is not done right at all. I agree with the majority of fans that the series trully ended with Aliens. Unless you are a diehard fan, move on and look at something else."
4,I thought you were dead?,"This movie has such a bad reputation.Generally, I think its a fantastic edition to the Alien series.Sure, the way Ripley came back is cliched, but how else could Ripley possibly come back to life? The 'newborn' alien has an equally bad rep, but I found the only annoying thing was that damn nose thingy on its face.But the rest is could. Jean Pierre Jeunet directed a fantastic underwater scene, and the alien designers made a fantastic alien nest.Alien Resurrection also has my favorite Alien scene.Its where the 8th Ripley clone discovers clones 1-7 and then burns them all with a flamer.Some bad CGI (but lets keep in mind it was only 1997) lets it down in places, but the rest of it is pretty good.4/5"
2,Wait for Alien 5.,"I am bordering on the chances of this film being saved by Alien 5. As it is, it stands alone, as a strange branch that does nothing for the first three, but starts the potential for a future set. At the moment I would say it's worth watching but only as a standard ""blockbuster"" style action film. The only familiar characters (while a bit modified) are the aliens, since Ripley has totally changed. I would have liked to see this film receive a great deal more in the way of improvements however. Why have the guy with superhuman shooting abilities? Why have the aliens so easy to kill? Why have the spaces so open, taking away any sense of suspense? Why not tidy up the science? Why not improve the script, and clean up the acting? Why not have more POINT to the android character being there? I could go on.P>Let's have a new film, please! A sequel to save this! Let's not end it on this potentially sour note!"
2,Good ideas but a disgrace,"As a great fan of the truly awesome Alien series, I was highly disappointed by the 4th installment. There are some good ideas, like the idea of cloning Ripley (first off, how is this possible when she is melted in molten metal in Alien3) as a way to bring back the Alien race to study them for science. That's the only real good idea of this movie, because from that point on it gets really stupid.Sigourney Weaver's acting seems incrediably forced (it was rumored she wanted no part in the 4th installment but was persuaded by a large sum of money-10+ million) as does all the rest of the acting. Character development is poor and the range of characters is weird. If its its own movie its okay, but compared to the other Alien movies its a waste of time and money.This is sad because the director is really talented (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, AMELIE, DELICATESSUN) and so are most of the actors. So I suggest watching the first three, and if you're interested, watch the 4th..."
2,Wouldn't recommend this one,"While this movie contained a reasonable storyline, and its FX were ok, I feel this movie totally wrecked the entire Alien series. Ripley being brought back after 200 years by cloning, coming out as half-alien herself, was just too strange. It was an ok movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who hasn't seen the other three. While the characters are original and the actors did play their parts well, I thought while watching this movie that it put a bad ending on a good series of movies."
2,Remember to close the cargo bay hatch!,"This is as visually impressive as you would expect from the director of The City of Lost Children, but the genius behind the Alien series has been sadly lost. The characters are nearly all stereotypes we've seen before in the first movie and two sequels, and the plot twist about Winona Ryder's character is old, too.The reason the first two Alien films were so brilliant and the last two were so rubbish was that the directors wisely concentrated on quick editing and darkness to hide the aliens from full view. In Alien 3 and this, the special effects are flaunted too much and there is no sense of mystery or menace.By the way, a small tip for any characters in future Alien movies: IT'S IN THE CARGO BAY!!!"
2,By far the worst of the 4,"I was always an Alien fan.The first two are great movies,and the third is my favorite.I went to see this and I was like ""huh?"". I always thought the Alien movies were supposed to be dark and menacing,not comical. Black humor is always welcome in these dark movies,but the silly pop-culture jokes in AR are woefully out of place. That's not the worst of it though. Sometimes the scenes meant to be dramatic/scary are laughable (the piece of brain scene,the death of the nerdy scientist scene,the whole dopey newborn scene). The reason why this doesn't get a 1 star is that I liked a few of the characters. Brad Dourif as Gediman was delightfully weird,and Michael Wincott and Ron Pearlman were cool and likable."
4,great movie,I bought this for my son for Xmas but I enjoyed it also. A nice ending [we hope] to a good series.
2,Alien Resurrection,"Read Matthew Farrell's review to truly be illuminated about this movies shortcomings. I only bought this movie so I now have all the Alien/Predator movies. The fact I bought it last after the last ""Alien vs Predator - Requiem"" doesn't mean it is worse. This movie has one thing going for it, Sigourney Weaver. If it wasn't for her acting this movie would have no draw at all. Mediocre story, mundane acting from the rest the cast, and less than inspiring sets, effects, and music makes it one to slip into the player when you have watched ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Predator"", ""Predator 2"", and ""Alien vs Predator"" many, many times and need a change. If you enjoyed this you really aren't seeing enough good movies but maybe you will enjoy ""Alien vs Predator - Requiem"".CA Luster"
3,A weak film with few shocks,This is a very formulaic movie that has a few enjoyable parts but overall is a letdown to the series. It's a film that gets very silly very quickly and doesn't have the class of the first two by a long shot.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
4,"Part 2 was better, heck should've really ended with 3.","While this movie is nice for just a popcorn flick, this series really should have just ended with 3. While I could enjoy the movie for what it was, which is why I'm giving this a 4 star rating."
1,Let's hope this is the last of the Alien series.,"I would like to warn all of you with weak stomachs, don't even think about watching this movie. This is, perhaps, the most violent movie that I have ever seen. I found it even more violent than Saving Private Ryan. Alien Resurrection is not interested in telling a story, the film seems only interested in grossing you out with unnecessary violence. Resurrection seems to be saying, ""You thought that last scene was gross, this next scene is even more violent and gross."" Hopefully this is the last Alien film."
3,NOT SO GOOD...,"After 3 brilliant movies, i think the ALIEN saga should end...but the greedy industry wants more money and this ALIEN RESSURECTION was born...It's not a bad movie, but it's not even closer to the quality and the story of the first 3...I saw this movie some times and it got good moments, but as i say this is not in the level of ALIEN, ALIENS and ALIEN III."
1,What is the point?,"Ok i dont know bout the rest of you, but the 4th film reallysucked. Winona wasnt made for the part, and the rest of the characterswere cheesy.The story was really stupid as well. Alien 3 was far more original with atmosphere and charaters even the music. This one just didnt have anything really going for it. And the ending is messed up too. wow.In other words, this one isnt really about aliens, its more about weaver and winona. We hardly see any aliens. Im hoping the next alien film will be directed by someone other then this guy. Cause ripley died in the 3rd and it should be left at that. And also that new characters should be introduced, like in the books such as aliens: earth hive.If you are a fan of movies with action, this might work. But hard core alien fans should just skip this one and rent alien 3 instead."
1,What a waste,"I cant understand how anyone could rate this movie higher then 1 star. Everything about this movie su**ed. Bad effects, bad script, bad story, bad acting, and tons of just plain stupid c**p. Next time some studio wants to piss millions down the toilet just right the check to me and ill put it to better use."
4,Could have been so much better,"I so want to give this 5 stars and up the average mark but it COULD have been such a better film. Aliens and Alien are one of my favourite films of all time and even though Alien3 wasn't a patch on either of them, I was expecting a lot from Resurrection. It was a good idea to keep Ripley in it and bring her back along with the brilliant Miss Ryder but the story just didn't cook. Good moments but not really too much suspense. What would now be great is to see an Alien film with them on Earth, as this film had much promise and on its own is a very good film but as the 4th Alien film is a dissopointment on the first 2 but it thankfully makes 3 not seem as bad."
2,It's been done before,"The previous three Alien movies each tried to do something different: the first (and best by far) was a horror flick, the second an action rollercoaster and the third a dark thriller. I enjoyed all three to some degree, by having seen the others there is no need to see this, since it's mostly the same premise and plot line - company wants to keep alien, alien escapes, Ripley leads a bunch of people to freedom whilst they get picked off one by one along the way. On it's own, for me there are too many stereo-typical characters and one-liners, and Wynona doesn't have any screen presence at all."
2,beyond horrible!!!,"I am one of the biggest fans of aliens movies, but I was very disappointed with this one. The whole cast is terrible and so is the plot. The only thing that saves this picture are some solid action scenes but that's about it. If you thinking about buying this one, rent it first!!!"
4,"Come on, guys!","Come ON! This movie is fairly decent, but what I really didn't get, while reviewing all the comments, is all that ""Winona's unbelievable and out of place"" crud. Winona completely stole the show, and her acting was about the only thing that really saved the movie. If you know what she had to go through making this, you'd appreciate her performance a little more. When younger, she almost drowned, and was actually pronounced dead. In this movie, she had to do the underwater scene in the ship's kitchen, which must've been incredibly hard for her. The special effects are good and all, and some of the lines are memorable, but I feel Winona's presence really pulled this movie through, along with some of the other cast members, not nearly as good, mind you, but not too bad."
1,One of the worst films of all time,"I tried watching this again to see if I might like it the second time around....I didn't. In fact, I actually hated it more. This list of bad mistakes and stupid ideas are legendary. For example; one idiot get the little jaw for the alien on the back of his head. The fool just stands there and feels the back of his head. Then he looks at his fingers, crosses his eyes and then dies. This alone is unforgivable. Believe it or not, the film is loaded with even more retarded ideas. One was having some guy in a wheel chair. Who thoughtthis crap up? If you want to waste some of your life, don't buy this, just rent it."
3,what the flying flock of seagulls!,"now, i am not angry at this DVD, rather the boxed set i bought a times before it...you see kids, i bought the ALIEN boxset and started watching it as soon as i opened it, instantly annoyed.the intro included the titles in the series as followsALIENALIENSALIEN 3ALIEN: RESURRECTIONand i'm sitting there looking at the box saying 'flying jesus F&$*' this only has the first three!so, is hunted high and low to find this fourth film in the ALIEN franchise and gave it three stars because of all the trouble i had finding it,and the boxset should not include resurrection in the menu intro!"
1,RIP Ripley,"May the Alien franchise Rest In Peace. With a very thin story line, questionable acting, and marginal special effects, this movie is a little less than entertaining!Of the franchise, Aliens will remain the classic!"
1,What HAPPENED to this series?,"Another one of those situations where they have a great franchise (Aliens), which great people working on it (Ryder, Weaver, Jeunet, et al), but still manage to come up with a bad, bad movie. Aliens3 might not have been great, but it at least had some interesting visual style going for it. This... does not. The nonsensical plot, poor costume/design choices, and silly ending ensure that this one is fit only for watching some neat FX and a few fun scenes."
1,Yelch. This movie [is bad].,"I was a big fan - a BIG fan of the first film, thought the second was great and the third enjoyable more in it's own right. This one though, should be put on the back of a truck and pushed down a sharp slope. Put quite simply - THIS MOVIE [is bad]. The only thing that made me watch it to the end was that it was a part of the Alien series. That's it. It has boring characters (even Ripley has nothing to make her interesting since she does nothing but sniff people and mumble), nothing scary about the aliens, just nothing, forget it. Try looking out of the window instead."
1,Worst Alien ever,"I think the 'Alien' Movie was the best ever, the atmosphere was the best of all four Alien Movies. 2nd was just like an ordinary Action Film. #3 was not that bad, it was mor like 'Alien'. But then the fourth movie was really something different, this is not a classical 'Alien' it's more an ugly Horror Movie with many unnecessary and in my opinion ugly scenes. I think the story itself would not be too bad, but why did the director had to show everything, that has been hidden in older Alien Movies. You know what happens without seeing 'bloody' scene. Conclusion: My ranking of the Alien movies: 'Alien', Alien 3, Alien 4, 'Aliens'"
3,Winona almost ruins a great alien come back.,"I was very relieved, that Alien 4 did not become the second disappointment in the Alien series. The plot itself is acceptable, although creating another story on Lt.Ripley again was unnecessary. I think they should have thought of something else, but okay. The acting of the cast is quite well, but Ireally didn't see the point of having Winona Ryder there. A rough and tough science fiction movie is no place for an adorable little girl. However the movie looks very exciting. The aliens seem to have picked up their scaryness of the second movie again, which was something that was lost in Alien 3.Alien 4 cannot touch Alien nor Aliens, but if you enjoyed those2 movies, you will enjoy this one as well. (SARR)"
1,"Ugh, i'm gonna puke...","what a total pile of crap. worthless. they screwed so much up it wasn't even funny. since when do the laiens spit acid? the newborn alien was so pitifully done (not to mention a bad concept in the first place) that I would have laughed (but I don't laugh at bad effects, that's the only reason)sheesh, cloned Ripley who has no emotion. No thank you. Instead of making Wynona a MORE advanced synthetic, she's LESS advanced. they were synthetic humans for both Alien and Aliens. now they're mechanical robots? that sounds like a step BACKWARD...oh well I'll calm down on my bashing of this rubbish and let you decide for yourself I guess..."
2,Somebody should have said 'enough'.,"This movie plays more like a comic book than anything else.The ONLY redeeming quality is the aliens themselves. So, if you're into special effects, watch it only for that.Poor story, weak acting and lack of direction make this a waste. The only one of the alien series I found to be worse was Alien vs. Predator... they really should be ashamed of themselves. Neither this one nor vs. predator even have 'B' movie quality."
1,The only thing that Aliens 4 should have started with was...,"....Ripley waking up realising that Alien 3 was just a bad dream! Then have a face hugger drop down and infect someone on the space station where they are docked in orbit above earth. She saves the day keeping the aliens from getting to earth, but not before all those company idiots get cocooned and chest bursting justice is served on all of them. Jeez, I should have been a rich executive producer/director, I could have made a ton of money for the studio instead of the lame amount those two flops of movies made."
3,A New Ripley - A New Vision,"This movie is perhaps not as flashy or high budget as the first two, and certainly not as moody as the third, but it is definitely watchable. Signory Weaver as Ripley is terrific as always and Wynona Ryder is wonderful as the android. The rest of the supporting cast is a little over the top with the comedy at times but the vision of a new world even farther into the future than what that last movies offered is enthralling. You're left wondering what kind of twist is going to be offered up next, even if it is a little hard to swallow (a pregnant alien?). But all in all, a fun way to spend an afternoon."
3,Pretty Good,the movie was very interesting but i was disappointed about the ending... i was hoping for more alien action and the end just wasnt that great... other than that pretty good
3,Not that interesting.,"I got this movie just because I needed it to complete my collection of the alien movies. Its not that great. It's just about as boring as Aliens 3, maybe even a little more. I give it a 3 just because its part of the original collection, but I would not buy this movie unless you need it for your collection.This movie was just an attempt to push the alien series into one last film. Compared to Alien and Aliens, this movie is rather dumb. I think it may be the worst film in the collection, even worse then Alien 3.I never liked this movie."
4,Great Movie,"A must own for any collector great special effects,acting,a pleasure to watch more than once...Enjoy."
1,Even Resurrection Cannot Revive The Alien &#65533;Franchise&#65533;,"THE ALIEN FRANCHISE IS DEAD. Why do they keep bringing Ripley back anyway? I mean, didn't they go out of their way to kill her in the last terrible Alien movie? The premise of this movie, standard Aliens vs. poeple stuff, could have been good if the movie had tried to make the situation seem plausable. The cartoony Alien and it's ITCHY AND SCRATCHY death scene was unforgivable."
3,A real stomach-churner.,The first half-hour of this movie is stupid and somewhat borring. It's not until the aliens inevitably break out that the movie shows its rollercoaster action that rejuvinates the series. Be warned though --- this one's the gorriest yet.
3,2.5 stars here. I wasn't buying it this time.,"Hey, I like 3 better than most critics. Did i just get tired, or just get lazy-crazy. I don't know but for me this was a good trilogy. I rented this once and never bought it. That is what i recommend. Rent it. See if you agree with the majority that loved it and gave it 4 or 5 stars. I was disappointed that people we thought had survived, didn't. That notion takes away from the first two movies in my opinion."
3,Additional Trailers,"From the disc's main menu go to the 'Extra Features' section where you will find an entry called 'Trailers'. As you'd expect, it will bring up trailers to all four Alien movies. Although not an explicitely hidden feature, many were excited to find these trailers on the disc."
3,A truly mixed review follows,"This film is difficult to rate. First, the dialog is so poor that it had me groaning. Yet at the same time, the acting was fairly good. Ron Perlman had the absolutely worst lines, yet he managed to create a memorable, convincing character out of such unpromising material. That's a credit both to his acting prowess and to the direction. The latter has a twisted, creepy feel so reminiscent of David Cronenberg that DC and Jeunet must be soul mates. Still, one has to wonder why Jeunet didn't insist on improvements to the screenplay, so my compliments to him have to be somewhat backhanded.If you're expecting the film to hit the heights of the first two, you'll be disappointed. But, since Alien3 was so lifeless and devoid of visual appeal, this one impressed me since my expectations had been so drastically lowered. Hey, look, set design! I remember that!"
3,One more alien myth added to the list,"One more spine-tingaling thriller is added to the tale of gory yet suspensfull action series. Once again Ripley, (Sigourney Weaver), has to fight for her life along with some friends (a couple of misfit space mechanics). One of them has a suprising little secret that i will not reveal. Riply has been reserected from the dead and has been cloned along with the queen alien inside her. The stupid human scientists (as always) have screwed up again in an attemt to study them and are going to pay for what they did. The acting and plot has much improved over the recent Alien 3 wich is just a bad movie and if nothing else will keep you on the edge of your seat the special effects will keep you glued to the screen. he gore in Reserection is a bit stomach churning though. In conclusion to my review this is a movie you woun't want to miss if you are an Alien fan. If your not, well lets just say consider renting it first."
2,Emotional sledgehammer. Ick.,"This could easily be a decent enough movie, except I think one rather serious mistake was made. Jeunet, though I'm not familiar with his previous work, certainly seems to be very good at evoking emotions and imagery. The problem is he does it far too often here. EVERYTHING is emphasized and made to be a highstrung emotional event, no matter what the event or what the emotion. Because of this, the movie ends up like an emotional sledgehammer (""*ANGRY!* *MEAN!* *SAD!* *TRAGIC!* *DRAMATIC!*""), and quickly becomes a real strain to watch, especially since the actors seem to really have to stretch to present the story in this fashion.This *could* have been a very good movie, if a little restraint had been employed. As it is, it takes a lot of effort to watch. (One of my friends is partially autistic, and even he couldn't stomach the sledgehammer.)"
3,Fairly entertaining,"I couldn't get past how chunky Keanu Reeves looked in the movie. The movie was still fairly entertaining. Morgan Freeman, as always, added more dimension to the movie than there really was. Keanu is still nice to look at, chunky or not."
2,"Fun, but scientifically illiterate","The people who put this flick together apparently don't understand the difference between combustion and nuclear fusion. I don't want to sound like a Puritan here, but come on! They shouldn't need a science advisor on the set to know something as simple as this ... all they need is somebody with a high school education.Having said that, the movie wasn't completely worthless. After I got over my initial irritation during the first ten minutes, I sort of got into the movie. Some of the chases were sort of fun, and the special effects were pretty cool. Morgan Freeman is always cool, even if he seems to play pretty much the same character in every movie. Keanu Reeves did a marginal job, which for him is an improvement (we all love the guy, but even he knows that he can't act).Near the end, there is more of the weird hydrogen combustion - nuclear fusion, which brought back initial irritation. Do these people in Hollywood drop out of school after the sixth grade? Duh!"
1,This movie [stinks]!,"I thought, hmm, keanu reeves is cool, morgan freeman is cool, and rachel weisz is damn hot. But it was incredibly disapointing, considering the cast and director. Don't Buy This Film!"
2,Reeves and Freeman keep this at bay,lacks in some horrible acting and story plots but that doesnt change the fact that Reeves and Freeman did a good job in this one...Chain Reaction is just another movie that has some good quality but lacks out in style as it comes out. Rachel Weiz is ok as the physisist. Her and Reeves should of had a love scene I mean come on Andrew Davis..your more focused on your big action scenes then the love connection of the two..god..even after the Chain Reaction accord..GOD!!
2,Predictable,The characters just weren't very interesting although the premise of the film is.Not even worth a rental
3,Fair Action Flick,"Keanu Reeves gives his typical wooden performance -- never laughs, phony smile. But you can always count on Morgan Freeman to carry the weight of any film. Please note Rachel Weisz's make-up and hair: The director deliberately made her look like a clown. Tammy Faye Baker would have been shocked. It is also the director's fault that every time Rachel and Keanu run to escape from the bad guys, Keanu has to reach back and grab her hand to pull her along. She wasn't cripple or retarded -- she didn't need Keanu's macho assistance to run like hell.The plot is based upon the chemistry of water -- extract hydrogen for fuel -- plentiful, clean and super cheap. Now, try and find the chemistry between Keanu and Rachel. That is one guy who can turn a wet woman into the Sahara desert by opening his mouth. He looks pretty, but my god is he boring. He should never be cast as a romantic lead. Unless it is with a piece of duct tape over his mouth.As action flicks go, this one is fair."
4,This Movie is Fun,"To watch this movie and like it as I do, you'll probably need to be ready... not for a totally realistic movie. I enjoy the movie as the story is pretty good and the action is almost nonstop. It is a good movie in my collection from Amazon."
1,A terrible movie,"Morgan Freeman is cool, Keanu is cool, Rachel Weisz is cool. But I was incredibly dissapointed in this movie, espiecially with the cast and director. Take my advice and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Chain Reaction,I have not yet received this DVD. I have written to the seller and have not yet got a response from them.
1,Horrible Movie,"I've never seen a worse movie, The cinematography was horrible, The dialogue was WEAK, and it had a horrible cast. The characters needed better development. Being a writer myself, I feel for whoever wrote this movie. . . It could have been good."
2,Blah Reaction,"I had no recall of this film despite the pedigree of director Andrew Davis and stars Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, and Rachel Weisz. After having seen it I wish it never existed. When this alleged thriller is not formulaic the story line is just plain muddled. At times Davis channels some of the inspiration from his masterwork, ""The Fugitive"", but all for naught because it's wasted in this pointless exercise. The aforementioned actors who can usually be counted on to elevate material are at a loss in this inert enterprise. Forgettable in the extreme."
2,Stretches the Limits of Believability,"If you can believe Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist (as in ""The World is Not Enough""), then you can buy Keannu Reeves as the savior of the world with his scientific knowledge in this film.How Morgan Freeman kept a straight face throughout filming is a compliment to his great acting ability."
3,Passable Action Movie,"This movie has so many flaws that you loose track after fifteen minutes, and the story is unoriginal as you can possibly get, but I have to admit that I liked it. Keanu Reeves makes a good action hero, and Rachel Weisz is adorably feminine and gentle."
2,suspend belief ...BIG TIME... and then some,"I thought this film had promise BUT there are holes in the film that you could drive a semi-trailer thru , and while that is normal in action films, some of the ones in this film really let the film as a whole down, really breaking the tension for me. Particularly the scenes near the end, that were nothing short of ridiculous. I mean what tight security in a top secret lab , really ?? I wouldn't buy this and only watched it because it was in the re-cycled movies at an opt shop. FUN yes, but worth spending REAL money for, NO."
3,Just another Action Flick,"The movie was very formulaic and the escapes performed by the 2 main characters seemed unbelievable. I was also bummed out that there was no romance between the 2 leads. I mean if Keanu is the actor they should have put in a romance, at least thats how I see it. The main thing I liked about the film was the plot surrounding petrol and how it was what the whole world wanted. Wow! This movie reflects alot of what I see now, granted that this is my view I speak of. The scientists have found a way to somehow capture energy from hydrogen, this would solve the problem with pollution and the need to fight over power and control involved with petrol. Well, I hope I am saying this right because I watched the movie a few days ago. So, the movie itself was way to predictable and cliched, but the story line was involving.Lisa Nary"
3,"Great story line, but ....","The story is well done, albeit a little cheezey. Morgan Freeman gives his usual excellent performance. Unfortunately, Reeves also gives his usual performance; its just awful. I don't know where Reeves got his ""training"" (if any) but he's never learned how to deliver a line in a scene. A number of others come to mind who would have given his role some real life. If you can get past that, the movie is ok."
2,I want to talk.,"I found these walkie talkies to be very annoying. They have avoice in them (one of the princesses) that talks every time youpush the button. It was annoying to say the least. There isno way to shut off this feature either. The instructions say,this is the same as saying ""over"". However I would rather say it myself than listen to this same squeaky voices over and over. Plus,you can't talk until the princesses are finished talking. My 4 year old granddaughter didn't like this feature either. She has used our regular walkie talkies and liked them better. This excessive chatting of the princesses is unnecessary."
3,Great Christmas Gift,I bought this for my three year old daughter and she really enjoys it. The reception is surprisingly clear although the tow mile range claim is kind of a stretch.We like the design and different Disney characters that you can display on the screen.Great Toy for s resonable price !!
5,Pine Bark for Endometriosis relief,"I read an article that Pine Bark helps relieve some of the pains associated with endometriosis. I had surgery for endometriosis in October 2006, and started having severe pains again in August 2007. I wanted to take a more natural route, as two surgeries in one year for the same problem seemed extreme for me. I talked to an herbalist and she put me through natural hormone therapy and after that, gave me the ""endo"" tea/tincture. Along with this, I took the Pine Bark Extract, and everything has been great thus far. I definitely recommend it for anyone who has endometriosis, because you know how painful it is and this really helped along with the other herbal supplements."
4,Horary Astrology and the 20th Century,"Yippee! What an marvelous experience to read a book on horary Astrologer that promotes clarity and understanding. I can use the examples of charts in the book for insight on my own personal charting. Marion March and Joan McEvers keep it simple for providing accurate readings. It is a book that makes a reader want to crave more knowledge but thus is the quest for more books. If it is written my Marion March and Joan McEvers, it is sure to be a winner. Namaste!!!!"
5,A good mystery,"Donna Thompson's characters are well developed and interesting. Her plots have wonderful twists and turns along the way that I never saw coming. It is an excellent book and keeps the reader waiting to near the end for the murderer's identity to be revealed and keeps you wondering ""who done it"". I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I am certainly looking forward to more work from this fine author."
4,Very excited!!,"Attended a workshop from Nadira a couple of years ago, but was still relatively new to bellydancing, so of course I didn't take any notes. Some of the moves in the vidoe were repeats from the workshop and some were new, still it just what I was looking for. Really like how broken down, step by step this video is, plus the extra practise segments are an added feature that I haven't seen previously. Really like having them available! Only wish there had been more combos/moves. But over all worth the investment."
4,"Great Teacher, Great instruction, Terrible song","This is an excellent DVD to learn, and practice layers, however I gave it a four stars because I absolutely, absolutely did not like the background music. Do not get me wrong, the method of instruction is excellent, and the instructor is very talented. I just could not get over the one song, and is the same song played throughout the entire DVD (she also does a performance with this song so maybe is just me). I love middle eastern music just not this song. I still use the DVD to learn, and practice layers because there is value in her technique instruction. I do better when the music inspires me so four stars it is. Also, great delivery service, it arrived on time and was well packaged."
3,Mostly pictures,"I bought this book because it was mentioned so highly and often in the last section ofMysteries of the Mexican Pyramids. It seemed like it would have a unique perspective on the Mesoamerican ball game and how it related to the sacred calendar. Unfortunately, everything that was interesting about it was summarized in the other book, and most of this book was illustrations. The information *is* interesting, all the more so because this is one of the earliest books that tries to figure out the meanings of the sacred calendar, even before Tony Shearer, I believe, but again, there was nothing in it except semantics that was different between this book and what I'd read about this book in the other book.In summary, if you want to read some original and old (1960s) interpretations of the Mesoamerican sacred calendar, and you like to look at pictures, and you haven't read Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, you'll enjoy this book. If you can get your hands on a copy of MMP, read that instead."
3,This one did not hit the spot,"I'm a big fan of this author, but this book just didn't cut it for me. There is nothing in the material about the book that indicates it is written for the youth market, but it certainly seems as though that is the case. A rather simple story, quite briefly, but not badly told. It warns about addiction, which I belive the author has had to deal with in his life. In any event, I was disappointed. You will have to make your own judgment."
2,A fair warning...,"I feel it's only fair to warn everyone that this CD is mastered from vinyl albums, not the tape masters! I will admit that they did a decent job of it, and the material itself is great (especially the cha-cha half), but come on -- surely the tape for these songs exists. Capitol should be ashamed..."
3,Sit back and enjoy the Italian music,I am a big Dean Martin fan and I bought this just for the Italian love songs. He sings them great. I have the original on vinyl. Once again Dean Martin is fantastic but the Cha Cha album is not to my liking. How many Cha Cha's can you take back to back. I definitely recommend this CD for the Italian love songs but not the Cha Chas.
1,I agree!!!,I plugged in the handsfree to my c417 and had my ear blown out by a blaring screech. Trash!!
1,Deep Relaxation,"It's a total disappointment! The background music is like the elevator music, I couldn't stand it! It is the common ""stress your muscle then relax"" technique which doesn't work. The instruction was terrible. I returned it!"
3,Nothing new.,"Back Cover description: It was strictly a business arrangement. She'd agree to be his pretend bride-in name only. But she never bargained on her own heart's betrayal.This is an OK historical romance. It takes place in San Francisco in the late 1880's. The characters are the same-beautiful, needy heroine and stalwart hero. No big surprises. How come these guys never help ordinary or plain women?"
5,Insider Secrets Revealed,Amazing insider views and comments on a hidden occupation and also a hidden part of our society. The author is often humorous but has a genuine gifted concern and warmth for his clients. I'm glad I bought this book. It's both provocative and entertaining.
2,The author appears to lack self-awareness.,"This book had all the raw materials to be a ""Great Shamu""-like expose of the telephone psychic industry. Instead, the author piously recited the dogmas of astrology, the tarot, and the like. He must have realized on some level that his ""psychic"" powers were really intuition and knowledge of human nature and that the star signs and tarot cards were merely a peg on which to hang his observations. But no such thoughts made their way into the book.To give just one example, did he really need to deal the eight of cups out of a tarot deck to see the future of one caller's relationship with a married man? If he had used a different deck and dealt the four of diamonds or the ""Get out of jail free"" card, how different would his reading have been?Also, the book has a chapter entitled ""How to Call a Psychic and Not Go Broke."" Given that the book has a copyright date of 1998, the list of scams has some startling omissions."
3,A good book for people who are not too demanding,"This book is perfect for chemist who wants to learn the basis in asymmetric synthesis. Many reactions are well described, and the explanations for the different principles are well done. But don't expect to find everything you need to be an expert in asymmetric synthesis and catalysis."
4,cool slow jam,the team of Tevin Campbell and Babyface were unstoppable back in the day. Tevin vocally was the truth. I hope he can come back because the Brother could Sing. this song complimented his voice and his overall range. i dug all the stuff that Tevin Campbell and Babyface did together back in the day. you always knew the trademark Babyface sound and you knew Tevin Campbell's tone. to me out of the 35 and Under Male Singers out today Tevin could take any of them vocally with ease. He needs to come back.
2,Too small,"These are pretty small and since the color didn' t match, they look pretty stupid in my car. Measure before you buy. Someone else mentioned the staples that hold the package together. Very hard to remove without destroying the product. Whoever designed this should be sentenced to 30 days of just taking these apart. Then there would be new packaging."
4,Nice Carpets - Terrible Packaging - Hard to take apart.,These are well made carpets and I have used them previously. They are hard wearing in the desert and sandy climate in AZ. Have a spiked rubber backing. I use them over new car carpets to protect them as long as possible. I simply trash them when they get dirty enough. Not much more to say.However I am deducting 1 star for the packaging - I should deduct 2. They come stapled together with a THICK wire staple. It took me 15 minutes to remove them with pliers and a screwdriver and they left severe indentations that might never work out. If you are unable to use tools to remove the staples (it has to be bent not to damage the carpet) then make sure you know someone who can before you buy these. They should figure out some other way of attaching them for shipment.
1,You get less than what you anticipated,"These are the worst quality mats you can get. I dont think it will last even 6 months. Utter waste of $ 30, They are small and the carpet is thin, Go to Costco and pick up their mats for $ 15 and they are much better"
1,Rubber Queen Plush Car Matts,"Rubber Queen 70553 Plush Carpeted 4 Piece Mats - BeigeI'm very disappointed in these mats. I was unable to find any nice mats comparable to the OEM GM carpeted mats locally so I took a chance on these. I will admit they are a little better than the cheap ones sold at the auto parts stores, but not by much. These are light weight and the ""plush"" is not very plush at all.Edited to say these mats are awful. I only used them for a few weeks because it was shedding so bad. It was all over my pants every time I got in the car. I washed them, vacuumed them and they still shed..."
3,Medium Quality Headphone Amplifier,"Not much to say, it works fine. But Headphone outputs are noisy. And as usual Behringer does not spend too much money on power supply filtering or noise-arm components.But I am OK for the price I payed."
4,slow down and heal,"This dvd has completely changed the way I do yoga postures and the way I teach them in my classes. Before students of yoga exert themselves into a series of asanas, this dvd teaches yoga students to tune into their own bodies and realize where tension is being held. The breathing techniques, demostrations, and explanations are thorough and educational. This is the foundation of hatha yoga. Before a student learns to challenge one's body in a pose or asana, learn to know your own body and what it needs to do to heal. That's what this dvd teaches and shows. Excellent as a companion practice to prevent injuries for weekend warriors and wonderful by itself for everyone."
2,ok........but what do you expect it's 6 years old,"This game is good for it's day,however i would recomend flight sim. 2002 or 2004.The grafics seem odd.It's just like some 3d buildings on a blob of paint.Fun when you buy it but gets boring after you've had it for 6 years like me."
3,Not That Exciting,"While impressive in features, Flight Simulator 98 is geared toward enthusiasts, not those who want get flying quickly and start diving under bridges, etc.If you've never owned a FlightSim before, I'd recommend buying an older, cheaper version to see if you like this type of program."
2,Couldn't find an issue,I purchased this item to assist me with the wiring of CAT 5 cable throughout my home. Unfortunately however the device wasn't able to determine a crossed wire. I had alot of troubles with the crossed wire port. So I borrowed a more advanced system from work - it was able to determine the issue. I was a little disappointed. I would say however that the device would work really well for just ensure that ports map. But leave it to the advanced equipment for intense troubleshooting.
3,ok butu not sensitive,"I used it to test my cable connection. The tester shows that everything is fine, whilst in real life the connection is not strong enough to pass through data."
5,Great Network Tester.,"The DataShark RJ45 Network Tester (70025) is an incredibly simple but essential tool. You can quickly and easily test everything from short patch cables to long through-the-wall data runs. This tester continuously pulses each of the 8 wires in succession and successively illuminates each of the 8 LEDs one at a time on both the sender end and the remote units. If there is a bad connection, the LED will not illuminate on the remote unit identifying the bad wire. If there is a cross wiring problem, the LEDs on the remote unit will illuminate out of succession so you can tell which wires are crossed. This makes it very easy to identify and fix any wiring problems."
4,So far so good,This wont be an extensive review.There isnt much to say about the product other then it does what it says it does. I've used it in the field without any problems. If there is a non positive about the product then it is the design. I would of liked to see the two seperate parts lock/fit together. That way there is less of a chance of loosing any parts. Now i just have to make sure i keep everything in the carrying case which comes with the product.
5,Nice and cheap,"For the nice low price, this does the job quickly and effectively. Drop your cable in and it will quickly rotate through, checking connectivity on each pin. As I would imagine is the case with all cheaper cable testers, this isn't *entirely* idiot proof, but it's close enough."
2,"More verbs, please!","While initially fun, the fact that the game comes with only four verbs--ate, jumped, climbed and saw--makes it hard to hold even a four-year-old's attention for long."
3,Thought I was buying the same game as what the teacher had.,"My kids have played Silly Sentences with their enrichment teacher & liked it so much that I thought I would buy it for them & we could play at home. A fun way to play & learn at the same time. Anyway this version of Silly Sentences doesn't have the spin wheel or game board according to what my 8 & 6-yo tell me. They said that their teachers game is better. This just has the different word groups & you pick from the different colored piles to form a sentence. I don't think the sentences are as silly compared to the other version where you spin the wheel. But for what I paid for it I guess it's worth it, but certainly wished we had the other version."
4,Fun game,"My six year old grandson had so much fun making silly sentences that his dad who was in another room thought I was tickling him. However, it's not easily transportable because of all the different cards. I'm looking for containers to sort and keep the different card categories. it's a fun game and does encourage reading skills."
4,Speech pathology,"I use this game during language therapy sessions to practice sentence structure and grammar. The pieces don't fit together perfectly, so they slide around on the table and the puzzle doesn't stay together. The game itself is a great teaching tool and the kids enjoy it. Appropriate sentence structure soon becomes automatic."
5,Funny things...,"Our son loves this game, he enjoyes trying to come up with funny things to say with the puzzle pieces."
5,Best reading info on mental cognitave nutrition,This book is a must read for anyone interested in their (or a loved one's) mental function with regards to nutrition and medications that greatly enhance the mental cognitive process. I think it should be a required read for all med students!!!
5,Outstanding and worthwhile!,"This book is so incredibly worthwhile and is a valuable reference resource. I highly recommend it! Any time the subjects of Alzheimer's or MS or Parkinson's etc. come up, I dive into the book. I have frequently been so grateful that I own it! When Dad got Parkinson's, he gave a copy of Dr. Perlmutter's book to his doctor in order to get better, more enlightened medical care. Such a great, great book!"
5,Excellent resource,This book is filled with very practical information about keeping your brain sharp as well as information on how to reverse memory loss. Memory loss is not inevitable.
4,Interesting read.,"This was an interesting read which covered healthy, and unhealthy habits for your brain. It is also a good resource for what supplements are helpful for your brain, and their recommended quantities and uses.I have used many of the suggestions from this book to add supplements and adopt healthy habits for my brain."
1,?,I guess this is a good book. I do not remember ordering it. I wonder if it was sent in place of another book.
3,Dated but still solid,"Still good information from Perlmutter who is well-respected in the field of functional medicine. The five years since this book was published have seen some important new research which, while not conflicting with Perlmutter's recommendations for having a better brain, is a little more encouraging and specific. In general though, having a better brain is not about supplementation, but about your regular diet, daily exercise and physical activity for your body and your brain. This book is worth a read, but check out some newer books and science, too."
2,"Well-written and clear, but I'm skeptical","I thought this book was quite clear and informative about the brain's basic structure and function. It was well-written for the layman. I cannot say that it is accurate; I am not a neurologist. However, when the authors veered into areas that seem to be quite experimental and controversial, I couldn't help but wonder how reliable are their claims to have some sort of useful regimen to stave off (or even treat) Parkinsonism or Alzheimer's. I am interested, but remain somewhat skeptical."
5,The Better Brain Book,I would do anything within reason to avoid having dementia! Dr. Perlmutter is a reliable source of information. I will take his advice and load up on vitamin B supplements!
3,"La,la,la","Frist of all I don't think musicals should hit the big screen, I gave three stars for Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones, Queen Latifah and Rence Zellweger for taking the parts and doing the best they could , good Effort.But the story itself was draining and painful to watch.You may catch yourself fast forwarding this one to see the story , but i guess you have to like Musicals to follow this one , I rather watch The Sound of Music with my sister than watch this .You need to like Musicals for the third time . Enjoy if you can!"
5,Very Cool.,"This movie will have you Razzle Dazziling in 2 seconds it is unbelieveable it is different,jazzy and dazziling. You have got to see it it is Unbelieveable step away from the computer and see it now IT IS SO GOOD. Chicago is rated PG-13 For sexual content and dialouge,violence theamatic elements and some language. The youngest age to see this movie is 12"
4,Very Cinematic,"I find Broadway musicals boring. They are just not my thing. The film versions are almost always yawners for me. ""Chicago"" is one of two exceptions (the other being the terrific ""West Side Story""). ""Chicago"" has been perfectly adapted to the cinematic style and moves with an exciting pace. Not once did I glance at my watch while watching it. Everyone is perfectly cast and enters the spirit of the piece with a great sense of fun and professionalism. If the genre bores you, as it does me, please give this film a chance. I'm certain you won't be bored."
4,Chicago,"This Blue Ray disk is stunning to watch. If you haven't seen this Academy award winner (best picture 2002) it is a must. It answers the question ""can they make em like they used to?"" the answer to that is a resounding yes.If you are not ready for the close quick editing used at the start of the picture you might be left somewhat confused- but stay with it - a second viewing will reveal its importance in getting the audience to make the necessary connections between the characters and plot the course of the story.Well filmed - the sets and costumes are second to none and overall the movie provides a evening of good fun."
1,Oscars Don't Prove Anything,"This movie is plain weird like all movie musicals. I still don't get what its about and I will not ever see it again because I don't want to know what its about. This movie is just plain dumb and terrible if you ask me. And why is it that SO many boring, and strange, movies are nominated for Oscars all the time? It just doesn't make any since! The Lord of the Rings and The Pianist were the ONLY two good movies nominated for Oscars. Chicago got its share of VERY undeserved Oscars. This is the worst movie of 2002! Don't bother wasting your money on buying this garbage. Chicago is a very BAD and BORING movie.GRADE: F- out of an A+"
1,Never Trust The Oscars,"I can't believe the masterpiece ""Gangs of New York"", or the kinda-classic ""The Two Towers"" got passed over for this load of filth. I mean, the songs aren't catchy, and if I hear ""All That Jazz"" (playing it ONCE at the Oscars is enough, not EVERY SINGLE TIME this movie was brought up...not to mention when it shows up in the film) one more time, I'll kill the man that came up with it. These actors (they're actors, not singers) cannot sing to save their lives, and the lyrics sure don't help. Add in direction by someone who can't direct, writing by someone who should have his pen taken away, and snapshot, confusing editing, and you have a witch's brew the weird sisters in ""Macbeth"" wouldn't touch. Junk."
1,BORING,"Who chose the lead roles. I was very excited to see this movie and how it looked on the big screen,I loved the play.What a disappointment. The leads cannot sing. there voices are flat and not appleaing at all. Madonna & Goldie Hawn in the roles would have been more appealing.Dont waste your money with this"
2,about this movie......,"The story of this movie is actually talking about the murder case of the actress but the film maker tried to package the movie with less boring method by adding music, singing and some jokes to it. I find that it is just another ordinary movie if the story of the movie concentrated on the trials of the murder case of the actress. These oridinary movie could be easily found in serial dramas(Cops dramas) in any part of the world."
5,chicago,everything was fine. i purchased a dvd and then i watched it. simple transaction dont have too much to write about outside of that
4,very enjoyable movie,"The movie is a great alternative to a ""live"" stage production-singing and dancing surprisingly good-thoroughly enjoyed it. Would highly recommend."
5,Good Musical,I love musical's. The music is great and the story is cute. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes musicals.
4,Fabulous,It is has rarely been done that a musical had been turned into a movie effectively. This is one of the bet adaptations I have seen.
2,Where's the Dancing?,"While it's great to see that -- with ""Moulin Rouge"" and now ""Chicago"" -- Hollywood is trying to bring back musicals, I wish they would include some dancing. Fred Astaire used to insist that the camera shoot him full length. Most of the other great film dancers did, too. But here, instead of dancing -- instead of Bob Fosse -- we get a lot of actors in various postures, and constant cutting by the director. It's like shooting a Shakespeare soliloqy: (wide shot) ""To be"" (close-up) ""or"" (medium tilt from Hamlet's shoes) ""not to be..."" That wouldn't allow much scope for acting. And ""Chicago"" doesn't display much dancing."
5,The best and most creative musical I've seen,"I didn't expect much from Richard Gere or Renee Zellweger going into this movie, but they really all did such fantastic jobs. It's no wonder that it has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards. This was truly the most classy and fun movie of the year. I didn't see a more unique one at all from 2002. I have never seen a movie done like Chicago before. Musical sequences are intertwined with reality sequences that truly make Chicago a very memorable movie. It is very risque for a PG-13 movie though, and there are a few cuss words, so you might want to think before taking the kids. Other than that though, Chicago was phenominal."
4,Perhaps I'm the Only One,"Haven't read all the reviews from all the 'Amazoners', and I may be the only one...ok my husband and I may be the only ones!! But here goes: Chicago was excellent in every way..except one. The music, the acting, the dancing, the costumes- heck, we're musicians and LOVE musicals! It does our hearts good to see them being made. That said, the only bit of criticism is that this movie's general message was dark and cynical. Do we need more cynicism and sarcasm in a society where there's no shortage! This may sound hokey, but the arts have an opportunity to elevate and inspire massive groups of people in a truly positive way. And we need it! That was the disappointment to us. For that, I wouldn't have given it Best Picture. Otherwise, yes, as so many have said, it was truly a work of art. I sincerly hopethis much effort, money, star-power, creativity etc can be put into many more musicals to come! And may they see the possibility."

2,Overrated,"This film is well done, but lacks 2 fundamental requirements for a good musical:fungood songs...Zeta-Jones is the best thing going for this movie."
1,Undeserved Oscar -- Moulin Rouge was much better,"How could this movie win the Oscar while Moulin Rouge lost last year? It must have been the weak competition. I could have cared less about the fates of any of the characters in this film. The songs were well executed and the cinematography was excellent, but who cares because the storyline was just terrible. There was no character to identify with in this film so it didn't matter what happened to anyone. They probably were gettting what they deserved. I wonder about people who could enjoy watching such an unlikeable group of people for a few hours. That it won the Oscar for best picture makes me wonder..."
2,"peaks immediately, becomes flat","Once something peaks, there is no where to go; a problem being no real depth to the singing voices. They are all good voices, mind you, they just run out of room quickly (QueenL of course rocks).But it is just an overall lack of building as the movie progresses...it all unfolds and is revealed right away (on a sight and sound level), so there is just nowhere to go dynamically.Juxtaposing tragedy, and a song about tragedy, in a wildly entertaining performance is a very cool trippy idea.The story itself just seems too trite and trodden."
1,THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTE JUNK!,At first I was exited to see this movie.But it turned out to be extremely boring! I don't think it had a good storyline at all. It was a total waste of money to see this movie. I just don't understand this movie.
1,A great disappointment,"Chicago is a great disappointment: it is a comedy without humor; a musical without music; a play without a plot; has much offensive material; however, many of the costumes were beautiful."
1,Too much camera movement,"In addition to the fact that this film version had way to much camera movement, I also found that I liked no character other than the poor abused husband. Everybody else had no character to speak of, and if you really can't root for the main characters, then how can you enjoy the film? Had the characters been written as seedy and flawed, yet somehow portrayed by the actors as likeable and human, then that would have been amazing acting. But I found them all to be superficial and sleazy. And I found myself thinking they deserved to go to jail!Maybe the play was better."
3,Eh...,"A bunch of crooks hang around in dark prisons and clubs. A bunch of people dance around half naked, singing about the details of killing their husbands. The cynical manipulators walk away with the happy endings. ""Chicago,"" while beautifully photographed and featuring one or two catchy songs, is a dark, dank film version of a mediocre musical, featuring no appealing characters and not much genuine comedy either."
1,A musical??,"I decided to rent this atrocity only because it received the best picture Oscar and was expecting something better. What the hell all the hype is over is beyond me. I'm a Generation X'er and this must be a nostalgia trip for the Baby Boomers or something. I can't stand musicals and this tried I guess to be a good drama mixed in with singing and dancing? It didn't do anything for me. I turned it off after about 15 minutes. I guess I grew up with too much violence, sex and profanity to stomach something like this."
1,Short and to the point.,"What a terrible movie! It's badly written and the terrible characters don't help. Can't believe I actually watched the whole thing. I did enjoy the razzle dazzle song but the movie is just not worth it. If you're unsure reading these conflicting reviews, rent before you buy. I bought it and it was a waste of my money."
1,hmmm.,"All I've heard about this film was positive, and today I finally went to see it. My friend and I were both disappointed though. Other than John C. Reilly and Richard Gere, I felt the film was poorly casted. It just didn't 'grab' me like other's. I'm a fan of broadway musicals, and film as well, but this just didn't move me at all. Perhaps they should have handed this over to Baz?!"
1,chicaca,"moulin rouge was a good movie, it was well made, used visual effects as way to get the audiences attention...in no way did chicago do that...it couldnt have been more plain and boring...a matter a fact, ive seen old 1930 movies that were more cinamaticly advanced than this one...oh yea, nice tracking shots...my mother can push a dolly as well as they did! but i did like the widescreen.......My review..."
1,Too Awful for Words!,"I had an idea that some things simply do not translate from stage into film well, so I would understand that ""Chicago the Movie"" was going to be only half as good as the ""Chicago the Play"" but this movie wasn't even half! While Renée Zellweger did a good job holding up her role, Catherine Zeta Jones totally tanked, and who in the world cast Richard Gere? He was god-awful in the part of Billy Flynn.There are those who can sing and dance and there are those who can't and this movie proves that. Gere couldn't carry a tune, and for all of the major characters there were ""stunt dancers"" that were way too obvious in the final cut. It's a shame.The lesson of this film is this: if you can't sing the part, if you can't dance the part, don't take the part. Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse are roling in their graves, and I want my money back."
1,SleepToChicago,"I must be from another planet.I've read so many great reviews of ""Chicago"".I LOVED ""Cabaret,""Loved the music from the play I heard over the years,Loved Fosse's work,but HATE THIS FILM.Its HORRIBLE.If your having trouble sleeping at night,buy this DVD."
5,Yea! Someone Can Make A Movie Musical Keep Moving!,"What makes most movie musicals uninteresting to ""average"" movie goers is that they move too slowly, milking emotional moments into eons....Not so here. The original play features nary an emotionally worthy character; they're all some version of a shabbychicago gangland stereotype. Thus, all is fair in developing a fast-moving, mostly lightly sardonic look at three main characters. You're not going to waste any actual feelings for these characters, so you have a lot of space to revel in the brilliant sensuality of the dancing/singing character development. Please pay no attention to anyone who would suggest that there is insufficient substance; apparently we are being given permission to check our musical story expectations at the door and to wallow in craft so crafty that it's hard to miss what's missing."
1,"KATE, IT'S BACK TO THE CELL PHONE ADS!","When are we going to get over Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglas? She can't act. In fact her pathetic finger-snapping in her cell phone commercials beats her performance in CHICAGO dead to rights. After this one, with its nauseating plot and gratuitous sex, I plan to boycott anything having to do with Chicago, including pizza and hotdogs, and flush my communicator!THE HORSEMAN"
1,Noir Spoof,"Its bad, i loved the cast and thought it'd be great but the director must've been high when he made this piece of crap. Same goes for the academy when they gave an oscar to both the cast and the movie. Still thought that Seabiscuit should've won. 2.5/10."
1,"Over-hyped, Overblown, Overrated","This movie narrowly beat out ""About Schmidt"" for the poorest excuse for entertainment I have experienced this year. Cynicism and satire have saturated Hollywood and a sane person can only take so much. The costumes and choreography were not bad, but the acting and singing were sub-par (save for Queen Latifah's sterling performance). Obviously, I am in the minority for disliking this movie, but it was just not my cup of tea. In the future I will use a little more discretion in renting moview that the critics and the Academy rave over."
1,Typical musical - DUMB,Movie musicals are usually dumb anyway but this one takes the cake. The girls are murderers and I didn't like any of them. Watch one of the many classics with Gene Kelly instead.
2,Good as a Musical but Fails as a Story,"Chicago was visually beautiful, well performed, and displayed some top-rate editing and directing. But ultimately, a movie needs to stand on its story.This story is not only cynical, simplistic and unsympathetic--its also flawed. The characters were all very unsympathetic and corrupt--the only two redeemable ones getting shafted or executed. A story doesn't have to be uplifting or happy to be good. But it does have to be complete. The fact that Roxie's devoted husband just sort of meanders and disappears into the night is a violation of story-telling on the highest order.I'm indifferent to musicals--I'll state that upfront. And yet, comparing Chicago to Moulan Rouge, I have to say that I'm shocked at the number of awards Chicago won. Moulan Rouge seemed superior to this movie in every way to the eyes of this layperson.Ultimately, it was a movie I could respect, but not love."
5,"It's Big, It's Beautiful, It's Chicago...Not Moulin Rouge!","This movie pops off the screen. My jaw hurt from smiling so much. The acting is superb, the story is superb, the singing is superb, the art direction is superb.If you loved Moulin Rouge! (as I did) you will love Chicago. If you hated Moulin Rouge! you will Love Chicago.One of the best movies all year (in many years)."
2,Old Hat,"I wish I had seen this film before Moulin Rouge.That innovative musical made this one seem stale and old hat. It should have been made in the 50s. The film seems so delighted at poking fun at Chicago and its corrupt justice system -- jeez, that was fresh when Hecht and MacArthur wrote The Front Page three-quarters of a century ago. Now, after their masterpiece (and Roxy Hart, Some Like It Hot and dozens of other films) its premise is stale, stale stale. And unlike Moulin Rouge, which used an equally stale plot to re-invigorate the way movie musicals were presented, Chicago's staging was an stale as its story line.The musical numbers might have been staged by Vincent Minelli ... I didn't find anything fresh or innovative or even memorable.I was shocked that Renee Zellwegger's blah performance was on Oscar. At least she was better than Richard Gere -- what a disasterous performance.I didn't really hate this movie ... I was merely bored by it."
4,TERRIFIC!,"Stays true to the play while beefing up the story line. All the performances were excellent, especially the supporting cast. Gere and Zellweger will never be mistaken for Fred & Ginger, but the production quality softens their limited vocal and dancing abilities. Worth watching even if you aren't a fan of musicals."
2,It's a well-done film but...,"I am pleased to see the revival of the musical, but I have real problems with ""Chicago"". My problem is very basic - for any show to appeal to me, it has to resonate at some level. Especially with a musical, there should be someone in it you can either identify with or would invite into your home. The only sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, but I'd invite him in just out of pity. All through the ""Razzle Dazzle"" number, all I could think of was Johnny Chochran - and no, I wouldn't invite him in either.A good show about terrible people just isn't enough for me - and I remain totally underwhelmed by Renee Zellwegger."
3,Great Music--Fair Movie,"Great Music. Great Choreography. Great Cinematography. Movie plot is as flimsy as the costumes. Catherine stomps around like a cave-woman. Renee is clearly the better performer. Case in point: Catherine and Renee's dance duet at the end of the film. Renee clearly is more graceful than Catherine. Richard is consistently pathetic as he is in all of his other films. High spots are definitely Renee & The Queen! I wish I would have just bought the soundtrack. I doubt I'll watch the film repeatedly, but will listen to soundtrack repeatedly. Why did this film win all those awards?"
5,Wonderful to own!,"This great film adaptation of the Broadway musical is now preserved on DVD to enjoy over and over. Includes the great number CLASS as well as some other fun DVD features.Latifah and Zeta Jones are dead-on perfect and even Zelwegger with her bony body and funny bee-stung mouth manages to turn in a performance that would have pleased the legendary Gwen Verdon. The direction and choreography are Fosse-esque enough to please Broadway diehards and the art direction, wonderful. Deserving of its Oscar and box office successes!"
4,An affordable trip to the big stage,"Chicago was a breath of fresh Broadway air! Costumes, glamour, and foot tapping tunes. While the plot wasn't rocket science, the stars delivered one heck of a performance. My first trip was with the girls on a night out, but my husband and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Great date movie - steamy with plenty left to the imagination. I'd add another 1/2 star to make it a 4.5. Enjoy!"
5,Love IT...,"Chicago is as good as Mulan Rouge but even better. The performances on that movie are amazing. Everyone seems to know what they are doing and enjoy doing it. Richard, Queen Latifah, Renee and Catherine, and the rest of the cast are wonderful. This movie is a MUST HAVE."
4,love this version,"Now I have seen the original broadway musical in 1997 when BEBE NEwirth(lillith from Cheers) was Velma. yo ucan't compare a movie to broadway.there will always be die hards who don't want Fosse's work tampered with, but it's hollywood. I like the movie it is updated to our tastes not in the 70's. and who knew Richard Gere can sing and dance...I saw this in the movie theatre.And only problem i had (I seen the movie on cable several times this month as well) when Catherine sang all that jazz, she didn't out enough feeling into the song and not in the correct order of stances.But watching the movie, it fit together. Yes, they skipped a few songs from the original musical,but I felt the story made more sense in the movie version,since i seen the musical for me I recommend it to anyone."
4,Better than expected. I hate musicals.,"I do not like musicals. If you like musicals then you will love it. However the musicals where not that bad and certainly you will sit through it unless you DETEST musicals. Okay musicals aside - Chicago is actually very funny and will make you laugh. The premise is simple. Women killers end up in jail and all want the top lawyer in town to represent them because he has never lost a case. Cue the female inmates competing with each other for fame and the lawyer. It is really done quite well, the acting is good and it is very funny. However I hate musicals but I still gave this one 4 stars because it is done well and is very funny at times."
2,It's okay,"I just don't get what the hype is all about. It's a movie that features the biggest stars of our time and I just feel like the media made it into a much bigger deal than it should have been. I didn't really like the characters because their not worth rooting for. One is a manipulator and the other a murderer and they got rewarded for it. Why would I want to root for those kind of people? I dunno, I just didn't like it but that's just me."
3,Why Zellweger?,"Chicago is a great old musical. It has a funny story, and good characters. Unforunately, in my opinion at least, Renee Zellweger has ruined it. She does not have the stage presence or voice to play the lead in even a movie musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere on the other hand are stunning. John Reilly (universally beloved schleppy husband) does a fantastic version of ""Mr. Cellophane"", almost worth the price of admission in itself. These actors play their roles to a ""T"", sleazy but sincere. They pour a lot of love into their characters, while Zellweger's feels cold and impersonal. It's a true shame, because of the other actors and because the production itself is so well done. The costumes, soundtrack, lighting and camera angles are fantastic. Bravos to the cast, boos to Zellweger."
2,Too Much Music,"I saw nothing on the cover to indicate this was mainly a musical. The minimal story line was squeezed in between 110 minutes of singing and dancing..... I would describe as ""interpretive modern jazz"". We finally used ""fast forward"" to speed through this dancing and at the end threw the VHS tape in the rubbish. What a disappointment."
1,BORING!,if it weren't for the beautiful catherine zeta-jonesthere would be no film! a big PASS.............wait for her newfilms to come out. please............no more of the rene films.sjw.
1,NOT Impressed.....,"Granted the dancing in this movie was keeping my attention,(thats it !)...but I didn't care of this movie at all! They made way too much of a BIG deal over nothing. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over with and I couldn't believe THIS was the movie I was waiting to rent & SEE !!!!DIDN""T LIKE IT AT ALL!!!! I DIDN'T EVEN WANTED TO GIVE THIS MOVIE 1 star.: ("
1,Best cure for insomnia I've ever run across,"To be honest, I wish I could give this 0 stars. The special features couldn't keep my attention, & neither could the plot. About the only thing that was of any interest was the scantily-clad women, & that got a little tedious after a while.Bring back the MGM musicals of the 1940s & 1950s. This was awful."
1,BORING,"Okay, I do not get what all the hype was about this movie, I watched like 15 minutes of it and was out like a light- if I need to sleep I can count on this DVD!"
5,Chicago is much much better than Moulin Rouge,"The first review I read said Moulin Rouge was bett than Chicago, I strongly dissagree. Moulin Rouge was a constant parade of costumes and annoying singing although I did find Nicole Kidman enchanting she could not save the movie. I saw Chicago 4 times in the theater and every time it just got more exciting and more true. Even though Chicago takes place in the Jazz Age it still seems true today. It shows that America is a disposable society and still is. It also has more interesting musical intervals I would pick Roxy Hart over The Can Can anyday. Nicole Kidman does have a better singing voice than Renee but Renee is a much more convincing actress. And the voices of Velma and Mamma overpower Satine's (voice). This a five star movie for anybody."
5,Love this movie!!,I adore this musical! The songs are great and the lyrics stick in your head...you'll be singing for days! I'm not a Richard Gere fan at all...but. his performance is amazing! If you are not a big fan of musicals...the story is strong and intetesting enough to enjoy even with the singing!
5,Chicago,Not enough stars for this product--love it love it love it and play it over and over and sing and dance lOLOL
1,Hideous,"To waste the time, talent and treasure on this film was too bad. Katherine Zeta-Jones is a very talented and stunningly beautiful woman, and she was the highlight of the film. Some other reviewer mentioned that various musicals have had cynical edges but the difference is that these classical musicals had a redeeming thread of morality. Though the characters may have had a lapse or some were just ""bad"", there was an accord about what was permissable for human beings in society. There are no ""good guys"" in ""Chicago"" and no one to root for, no underdog whom you can relate to, no reason not to hang the two ladies. And you don't even care. Add to that the freakish surrealism of the filming style and you have a long and unpleasent viewing experience."
1,This Movie was Wretched.,"Wow. I had heard so much about this movie and all I can say is...don't believe the hype. It was terrible. Renee Zellweger is a pasty faced wanna-be, and Richard Gere is just...ick. Good God...who told this man he could sing and dance let alone act?The only saving grace of this movie if Queen Latifah, and that's only because she's mildly humerous.Catherine Zeta Jones was alright, but she didn't deserve and Oscar...and neither did this over rated piece of tripe.The movie is dark, depressing, and lacking any originality. I hated this movie."
1,Chicago: City of weak shoulders,"An amazing achievement: A truly boring musical. All the choreography has been removed, replaced with quick camera cuts and distorted views. Slow and uninteresting."
3,The most unworthy Oscar best,"Granted this movie is very well made, great Jazz, quality acting. But Oscar best film award? Hell no! Shame on the Academy to fall on a ripple effect - Moulin Rouge should be the true worthy winner the previous year, but unfortunately it has to take a whole year for them to realize the success of the musical genre, and as a ""felt guilty"" payback, to give the award to another just so-so musical - ""Chicago"". This makes it the most unworthy Oscar ever. If you want to watch a true masterpiece of musical, go buy Moulin Rouge instead, it beats Chicago hands down in every aspects of movie making - the visual and musical effects are stunning. Remember, it is the pioneer work of Moulin Rouge that reinvented musical genre and reawakened people's interests toward the musical genre. Academy has no way to payback for what Moulin Rouge did for the industry."
1,simply horrendous,"I am halfway the film and it has been painful. Obviously Fosse was a dancer so the lyrics are far from great. The tunes are repetitive and there is NO DANCING. The roles acted by famous stars are lacking... I have seen these people act better in other movies. As you may suspect from the number of ""used and new"" of the DVDs listed here, this is a movie that had a lot of publicity that it did not deserve."
4,Awesome version of the Stage Musical,"In February, 2006 I saw Chicago on Broadway. On April 2, 2006, I saw the movie. I loved the musical, and the movie is a pretty good version of the show. Obviously, the Broadway Musical is better, but the movie was well-done. Other than a few ""uncomfortable"" scenes, I loved it! (It is definitely PG-13, but not PG-16)"
2,An Above Average Musical-Made-Movie,"I really don't understand all the hype and praise surrounding this movie. It is nothing new-- ""Chicago"" has been around in some form or another for 70 years or so. It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average-- Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come. Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic. Rent, don't buy, with low expectations, and you might be entertained. Just don't get sucked in by ""all that jazz."""
1,GUYS BEWARE- -mother of all chick flicks,"GUYS- this movie is to be avoided at all costs, unless you love musicals. Any guy who walks into this unsuspecting, as I did, is in for 2 hours of hell. Only one guy gets shot in this movie, no nudity at all, and lots and lots and lots of singing and dancing. No car chases, no explosions, no shootouts... Definitely not a ""man's"" movie, and nothing you would talk to the guys at work about. You have been warned! Let the woman watch it while you give the lawn a 2 hour mowing."
1,Sleazy,"Although I enjoyed the music in this film, that's about it. My biggest gripe is that there are no characters you can admire or even like in it. Roxie's husband is the only decent character, and he gets dumped on throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are sleazy, deceptive, awful people, and unfortunately that is celebrated throughout the film. Not surprising that the Hollywood cesspool went ga-ga over it. I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit. However, I would recommend that you rent this movie before you buy it. I bought it before seeing it at the recommendation of a friend, and unfortunately wasted my money. It's not a movie I want to watch again."
1,O Star,"Zero Star.Nothing redeemable here. Bad people behaving, singing, and dancing badly and getting away with it on film, in the box-office, and with the Academy.It is slick...but so, too, is a scum-film on an aeration pond in a sewage treatment facility. Regarding this putrescent bio-layer; flush it."
5,All that jazz--and a bag of chips,"I'll make this brief: Yeah, it deserved all the academy awards it won. Catherine Zeta Jones is more brilliant as an actress and dancer than she is sexy in this film. The direction is immaculate. Richard Gere is compassionate and great in a perfect against type role for him. Rene Zellweger is magnificent. And Queen Latifa unexpectedly steals almost every scene she's in.Oh yeah, and the music, dancers and choreography...are out of this world.Welcome back movie musical; welcome home."
2,Buy the CD,"The story line is most non-existant and what little there is is hard to follow. It cuts in and out of reality and musical fantasy, now time and then time to the point where you are never sure just when you are or what's going on. However, the music is hot. My recomendation? Buy the music CD."
3,So So,"I don't care if this movie won an Oscar and everyone else said that it was the bomb. First off, when I wanted to get info about what this movie was all about, I couldn't get it. So finally, I went out and got it on DVD, and watching Renee Zellweiger play this stage struck,glory seeking,adulterous floozy made me want just shake my head. And the part when she sits up and faint talking about her ""baby"" because Lucy Liu was getting all the spotlight upon her arrival at the jail,was just too dang much. Zeta-Jones was classy, Richard Gere was ok.He didn't quite convince me there. Out of all the folk I kind of felt sorry for Zellweiger's husband in the movie Amos cause he worked hard, paid up front to get her out of jail and she didn't give him a backward glance. The songs and all were good, but that's about it for me."
5,~*~*~*~*~Chicago.....The Best Movie Ever~*~*~*~*~*~*~*,"My friend and I went to watch ""Chicago"" together, and we thought it was one of the BEST movies ever. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job!! And seeing Richard Geer tap dance was awsome!! My favorite part was when they were doing the Cell Block Tango! It was great to hear all of them sing!! I highly recommend you to watch this movie!! It is worth all your time!!"
2,Bob Fosse is turning over in his grave!,"I love the show ""Chicago""; however this is horrible! Renee cannot sing or dance! Putting men into the number ""Cell Block Tango""?! - Fosse didn't and he should know! Also SIX (count 'em) SIX songs were left out. The best thing about this movie was that Marc Calamia (hot!) is in it as a dancer (from the Broadway cast) but all too briefly. Buy or rent ""Fosse"" if you want to see more (almost ALL of!) Marc and some REAL dancing!"
3,How did this win Best Picture?,"With all the hype surronding Chicago, I expected a great movie but what I got was a decent music video that just happened to be almost 2 hours long. The songs weren't that great and the story was the same as you would see watching what my grandmother calls her stories on daytime television. It's lone saving grace was Renee Zellweger who was fun to watch and made me laugh several times. This movie is worth seeing but i don't think I would want to own it. The disc itself looks good and the sound is great but for a Best Picture winner I expected more than the single disc version given here, I think we will be seeing a 2 disk Special Edition soon so if you must have this film on dvd go ahead and get this one but don't be surprised when a better version shows up in 4-6 months."
5,Chicago the new movie,"This broadway production made into a movie was fantastic. Seeing Richard Gere tap dance was extraordinary. I loved hearing everyone sing, and i sugest everyone to go and see it."
3,"Rightfully praised, but not ""All That Jazz""","Musicals have been undergoing a resurgence and when ""Chicago"" hit the big screen, critics and musical fans alike went gaga. Well the fanfare's died down a bit and it's time to take a look at the good and bad about the cinematic version of ""Chicago"".First of all, after having seen the DVD's deleted scene I am more convinced than ever that the exclusion of the Zeta-Jones/Latifah duet ""Class"" was a glaring mistake. This highly sarcastic and visceral song was for me the highlight of the Broadway musical and to have taken it out took out some of my joy upon viewing. I equate this to making an ironic omelet and leaving out the satire.Great job by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger. It is a great movie - but as far as greatest musicals of all time, come on. Busby Berkeley is, has been and will always be the cappo di tutto cappos of musicals."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"I had hoped to see a film reminiscent of the colorful, happy musicals of the 40's and 50's, with chorus lines and big productions. But, much of the movie is not colorful, and doesn't approach the happy feelings imparted by earlier musicals.I would give the film one star up to the point when Richard Gere finally appears. From that point on, the movie gets better and better overall. If I could go back in time, knowing what I know now, I would plan to arrive at the theater around 20 minutes after the film started!"
2,Best Picture? Not even close...,"Speaking of Rene Zellweger, that just reminded me that I also recently watched this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either."
4,Some men just can't hold their arsenic,"I saw this movie and I really liked it. I was skeptical at first, especially about Richard Gere and Renee Zelleweger, but I was pleasently surprised. While Renee is no Gwen Verdon, and seemed just a tad miscast, I think she did okay. I was very pleased with Richard Gere, who I think had a great voice, something along the lines of a twenties or thirties radio personality. And he did his own tapping, with no tap track! (I checked.). Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifa kicked .... ""It looked like Queen Latifa stole Renee's bust..."" so says one of my friends about the costumes.Even if you're a purist, this is a pretty good version of Chicago, and if nothing else, go see it for ""Cell Block Tango"". That has become my favorite song of the whole thing.""He ran into my knife ten times!"""
5,ASTOUNDING!,"Having seen the original 1975 production 30+ times, I was rather concerned about it's transition to film.I worried for nothing.Forget this ""best film of the year"" nonsense, we're talking the best film I've seen in my 49 years.Right from the opening notes of the ""Overture,"" I was hooked.It's impossible to single out a performer, or a number in this film, because it's one of two perfect films I've seen in my lifetime, the other being ""Cabaret,"" which shares the same pedigree.Run to your nearest cineplex!"
2,The Queen redeems the show,"There's alot to be said against this movie, the brutality masked alluringly by sex and lilting voices is depressing. But the pearl in the stinky oyster is Queen Latifa. I'd never listened to her before and now I think she's just amazing. She belts out Mama and you are hooked. Its worth getting the movie to see her in action. The rest are quickly forgettable at best."
4,My surprise,"I didn't actually know this was a musical. I thought there was music, not many musical numbers. I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline was great. Catherine-Zeta Jones was phenomenal and gorgeous, while Rene Zelwegger was kind of annoying."
1,Gratuitous and self-serving,"Yes, musicals are really about the music and dancing, and less about the story. Unfortunately, this one seems like the actors were having coffee one day, and all said ""hey, wouldn't it be fun to be in a musical so we could all sing and dance??"". I can't for the life of me understand why or how this piece of ""art"" got any awards, or any repeat views. I like musicals, but not this one."
1,Not as great as people say.,"I really found this movie bland. A girl aspires to be a broad-way baby. Terrific. I don't care about your problems though. She shoots a guy and ends up in prison.The movie is a musical. This musical had me annoyed at every minute. How hard is it to stay down and not break out into a song every minute. Sit down, and stop singing. Give me a three second break.I bet there are a few people getting ready to ""thumbs down"" my review. ""I liked that one song where they sang!"" No. If you hate musicals pass this up. There's no action. Also, the only comedy in the movie is the lack of sitting down for three seconds and not singing. Sit down. One second of not singing please. Get over the songs."
2,Glitz but no gold,"Choppy and jarring best describe the transitions between ""reality"" and the production numbers. Renee Zellweger looked and acted like a concentration camp survivor while Catherine Z-Jones waist (post pregnancy?) was poorly disguised by the hourglass costumes, although her dancing was excellent and her songs solid. Richard Gere is the surprise standout with excellent songs and dance routines.The un-morality tale seemed stilted and bizarre with little emotional depth. It continues jerkly along until the finale that is probably the worst song and dance number of the movie. The DVD is saved from even a worse rating (2 stars) by the solid and entertaining back up given by the supporting characters. Needless to say this title didn't make it in to my collection and unless you are a Broadway Jazz junky it shouldn't be in yours."
1,"Worst ""Best"" Move","The Motion Picture Academy must have been out of their minds to give this film a Best Picture Award. The film is totally miscast (Zellwiger and especially Gere, whose performance is as wooden as Sherwood Forest), and the clumsily-unfolding, simplistic plot is made even worse by second-rate dance numbers which attempt to ""jazz up"" the story. The only thing worth watching is the first-rate song and dance duet performed by Zellwiger and Zeta-Jones, but that occurs in the last ten minutes of an otherwise overrated movie. I would have had a better time dozing off in an easy chair than watching this drivel."
1,Chicago,"This movie is horrible. How did it win any awards? I gave it a 1 star rating, it really should be a 1/2 star, but that was not available."
3,Chicago,The acting was excellent but the movie wasn't what I expected. I can't say I really enjoyed it. I didn't like the idea of Richard Gere being a song and dance man.
2,Unengaging,"The characters in this movie never came alive for me. The dancing and singing was well done, but the actors weren't able to make the jump between ""reality"" and ""fantasy"" convincing. Only one minor scene, by a minor charactor portrayed any depth of emotion (Mr. Cellophane)."
2,"Big, bigger, biggest. I mean, smallest","People may call this the movie of the year.BUT I wouldn't.The music is big and rhythmic and powerful.BUT it does not swing like the 30s band sounds it builds on.The dancing is flashy.BUT is it good?The girls are everywhere and designed to stimulate.BUT Mary Louise Parker and Janel Moloney on ""The West Wing"" are sexier just standing there than the two stars and the chorus babes put together.The acting is on a grand scale.BUT I somehow cared about none of the characters....The cinematography and set design and colors are terrific.BUT ROAD TO PERDITION, QUIET AMERICAN, GOSFORD PARK did that better.The movie is creativity incarnate.BUT at its core, empty.es as duo."
2,Just Ok,"Chicago was just ok. I rented this movie last week and thought that I would be blowed away due to all the hype about this movie. Well, there were a few cute numbers with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, that's about it. The characters were not developed and the story was so simple that it was almost boring. Rent or buy Moulin Rouge if you want to see a great, moving musical."
2,A Stylish Music Video,"Frankly, I still have to discover why is this movie so overrated...Sure, the production values are good, the songs are appropriate, the acting is decent and it has some neat visual moments. Yet, it doesn`t really work as a solid, consistent film, just a bunch of stylish scenes with an almost nonexistent plot. And the characters, where are them?! What I saw was just a collection of cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures that couldn`t get my interest. Since I don`t really like musicals all that much, maybe I`m a bit biased here. Still, it is not a great movie, it brings nothing new and doesn`t deserve all the praise it got. Even as simple entertainment it`s average at best.Pure eye candy, easy on the eyes but vapid and forgettable."
2,NOT A GOOD MOVIE!,I don't know what all the hype is about this movie. The money I spent to rent this movie was by far the WORSE way to use my money! It is NOT even a good musical!Save your money and rent something else!
3,"dark, cynical, ""feel bad"" cinema","It's ironic that this film's tremendous success has been attributed to a craving for ""feel-good"" entertainment: in reality, this is a dark, grim, cynical downer of a movie. Chicago is devoid of a single likable character. The music is catchy, and the acting is solid throughout, but it's all in service of a story that didn't deserve to be sold."
1,not good,When this item arrived the case contained two disc 2 of the special features. Very disappointed with my purchase. Will think twice next time.
3,Seems to be a poor deviation of ...,This was a poor take-off or imitation of ALL THAT JAZZ. The actors and actresses were great but it did not meet the standards and brilliance of ALL THAT JAZZ.
3,How to Fosse in10 easy steps....,"A decent adaptation of the Bob Fosse classic. Zeta-Jones shows off some terrific talent. Zellweger's voice doesn't quite hold the weight that might come with a seasoned Broadway voice, but she holds her own. Vieing for the ""needs improvement"" vote for singing is the male lead Richard Gere, who spends the movie singing through his nose, and underplaying where he should ham it up, and overperforming scenes that don't require it. While I enjoyed the movie, I think it would have been better served if they'd gone with performers who could meet the demanding requirements of most Fosse classics."
3,Cashing in of the success of Moulin Rogue,"I had epected something more to be perfectly honest. Yes, sure, the acting is good, and all the actors are very well cast; not the least Richard Gere.What I lacked was a solid story, and likeable characters. Everyone is just out for themselves, and they let nothing get in their way. Is this how the American Dream should be? The only character that is sympathetic has really only one line and is hanged in the middle of the film.If you want to watch a film about how shroddy the American Dream is, and how unfair its system of justice is, then this might be the film for you. If you want a nice song and dance film I would recommend Moulin Rogue, or Cabaret."
3,Overrated,"Why this movie got such great reviews is a mystery to me. it was okay, but not half as good as all the hype suggested -- and not nearly as creative as ""Moulin Rouge"" was a year or so earlier. And yet that wonderfully imaginitive movie has the bad reputation, while this middle of the road movie had people falling over themselves in search of ever higher praise.Bland movies are popular in ""exciting"" times, I guess..."
4,good but not a classic,"the litmus test of a musical is whether you remember the tunes days after you've seen the movie. 'chicago' doesn't pass the test. i couldn't even recall one song one day after seeing this flic. by coincidence, i'd watched 'my fair lady' the night before, and even now, almost a week later, i can still whistle the tunes in that classic. so 'chicago' is a glitzy, energetic film and worth seeing. but it doesn't stand up against the classics."
4,Good performances,"I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones and she does an amazing job in this film. I was amazed at how good a voice she has not to mention her amazing dancing ability. The same can be said for Gere and Zellweger. John C. Reilly plays the biscuithead husband exceptionally well and Queen Latifah is really good as Big Mama, her solo scene in a gold lame dress brings new definition to the word: decollatage!"
5,"Please, God, no ""Pan and Scan""!","...when this DVD is released in August,[i hope it is]in letterbox format, not in pan-and-scan format. I have seen CHICAGO on the big screen 5 times (so far) and if the DVD screws with the original presentation, and cuts off the sides, I believe I will lose my mind..."
1,This Is Not The Best Movie Of 2002,I have seen plenty of movies in the year 2002 that were better than Chicago. This movie is very puzzling and pointless. I was about to walk out of the theater during the first twenty minutes...
3,Chicago,"""Chicago"" is a good movie. It is dazzling and its a good musical. But why on earth did they choose Renee Zellweger to play in it! She was an actress who played on low budget movies. And come on! This movie has been nominated thirteen Acadamy Awards!? What kind of critics are out there! ""Chicago"" is a good movie that should have been nominated for maybe two or three Academy Awards, not thirteen! This movie is not that great! Its just good. ""Chicago"" did not amaze me that much anyway. I give it three stars. Its not a movie I highly recommend you see. But it is an O.K. movie if you are a young teen."
1,and all the zzzzzzzzzzzz...........,"What is with the American public nowadays!! How can anyone be impressed by this bore! Zeta-Jones has no vocal range (I'll admit she's a fair hoofer), and Gere is okay, but really---what's the big deal. I've seen better in amateur theatre productions. Zeeleger at least can hit a high note. But on the whole, it's like someone decided to film a musical on a broadway stage, and the conceit of having it all in Zellweger's character's head just is insipid."
3,Good but not Great!,"Although Chicago was esteemed by many critics and viewers, my own personal opinion is that it was good but not great. The film is filled with outstanding musical and dance numbers. The acting was better than i thought it would be, and i was very surprised to see the intricate detail that went into the making of this movie. However, i felt that it did not deserve the award for best picture at the Oscars. It has a very cheap plotline that reflects the gradual downfall of our society's moral standards. It says that is ok to kill, lie, cheat, and use anyone to get what you want. It gives the impression that our one true goal in life should be to become rich and famous and that we should do anything we have to to get it. It is a cheap rip off of much better musicals such as: ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" ""Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" etc. In my opinion this movie was not all it was cracked up to be."
5,great movie,"i thought this was a great movie. it is short, so those of you who are like my mum, dont have to get up halfway through the movie. It wasn't my favorite movie, but i would definately watch it over and over again. The dance choreography was great. i definately would recomend this to anyone"
4,Good.....,"When I started watching this movie I was not sure if I was going to like it or not...some of it seemed a bit choppy. It took me a while to get the jist of the whole thing, but once I got into the swing of the film, I enjoyed it. I thought that the songs were great for the most part, and I was impressed with the talent that each actor/actress showed in this film. If you are into musicals, then this is the film for you."
4,Well worth the wait,"It took over 20 years to bring ""Chicago"" to the screen, but it was worth the wait. They actually made the story clearer and easier to believe that characters could move into and out of musical scenes. Bravo.This movie is infinitely better than ""Moulin Rouge"". In ""Moulin Rouge"", after 15 minutes I was bored with the constant camera movement(Luhrmann clearly must have wanted to attract the MTV crowd), and eventually found the whole movie irritating.My only complaint about ""Chicago"" was Richard Gere. I thought that while he was equally charming and smarmy, he just wasn't a strong enough presence to keep up with Zeta-Jones or Zellweger.Too bad it took so long to bring to the screen. It would have been even better with the original Thelma and Roxie, Chita Rivera (who has a cameo in this one) and Gwen Verdon."
5,Razle dazzling crowds,"To compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge is ridiculous both films are exceptional in their own rights. Chicago's direction is superb and the continuity is impressive. The editing is sharp and never misses a beat. The acting is convincing and never gets flat; the ensemble cast worked well together and electrified the screen. Being a fan of both Moulin Rouge and Chicago I can safely say that both of these features are amazing and yet very different which is how it should be, no two films although in the same genre should be alike because if they are then everything will seem routine and old and the audience will ultimately get bored."
1,technicaly the worse movie ever,I went to see this movie and into it for the first 20 min or so then i kept seeing somthing at the top of the screen that had we wondering. and then again i saw it. it was the michophone boom droping into the shot. now i was a little suprised to see that . i thought it would only be in those two scenes but again it kept comminh back. in the coutroom it looksed like richard wwas about to get hit on the head with it. and it was not hidden at all. the shots should have been reshot. i find it funny that not mony other proplr want to admit that it was in the shots. just watch the dvd when it comes out you will agree it shoul not be getting all the press it has been getting. it was like watching a high school film class movie with big names.
1,One of the WORST movies ever!,Don't waste your time. This movie was so bad that I couldn't even finish watching it.
5,ALL THAT JAZZ!,This movie was great!The singing the dancing everything!charactersroxie heart:A girl who really wants to sing and dance on thestage.velma kelly:A girl who already dances and singson stage she kills her sister for um wellnever mind ( in jail with roxie)billy flynn:A lawyer who has never lost A case.amuse:Roxies cheated on husband (and A pushover)This movie is very close to be rated R so thinktwice before getting it for your kid.
1,Keep up the hype on this wonderful movie!,"This movie deserves 5/5 ! for sure , it's funny and has great music and Catheirne Zeta jones is not fat? people in the 30's werent skinny she is perfect as are the whole cast!"
1,"Music good, story bad","The music was pretty good. My favorite, by far, was ""Cellophane Man"". The story left me very dissatisfied. I strongly wantedjustice to prevail in the end, and it didn't. If you like a darkending where bad prevails over good, then this is your movie."
1,Absolute trash....an insult to the city of Chicago,"I watched this movie thinking it would live up to its billing. Instead, it was almost two hours of absolute, boring trash! I still can't believe this garbage won Best Picture. There's no way this film is better than the second installment of Lord of the Rings. Some critics hailed this movie as a wonderful return of the musical. That's hardly the case. If anything, this film is excrement in fancy wrapping. If you must see this movie, save yourself some money and rent it instead. It's too bad the copy I rented didn't have a self-destruct feature."
2,"Distractingly artsy, and that's too bad.","Good and interesting story with absolutely top-notch actors, continually interrupted by obnoxious Broadway-ish musical numbers. Many of the performances were good, but many more were the type of stereotypical NY elitist silliness that I feared when I put this disc into the PS3. This movie has nothing on Dreamgirls, 1776, Hairspray or The Music Man. Heck, I'd force myself to watch High School Musical before watching this thing again. I like musicals. I didn't like Chicago."
3,Chicago,"I have to give it at least 3 stars for the performances of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifa. As a dancer, I found Rene Zellweger's performance painful to watch. Overall, it was sort of a disappointment. A great musical that could have been more entertaining if cast differently."
1,NOT RECEIVED -- ORDERED 8/4/11 -- WAS DUE BY 8/8/11,"THIS ITEM WAS ORDERED VIA JakeC181, bordebook, on 8/4/11; it was estimated to SHIP BY 8/5-8/8/11 and has still NOT BEEN RECEIVED.I AM REQUESTING A REFUND DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE ALREADY STARTED THE CLASS AND HAVE HAD TO PURCHASE THIS TEXT ELSEWHERE.THANK YOU!!!"
1,all his fathers sins,interesting story.. Lt. Ray Biondi seemed so sympathic to the female criminal that I cant help but wonder how he does on an investigation. I get the feelin that if I wer cute and sensual I woul get so much sympathy.Anyone checked his records ??
3,Eye catcher,I love Donald Pliner shoes and most are very comfortable. This one runs narrow in the strap area. I am a 9 medium and would like it better a little wider. The color is beautiful and the heel is very comfortable. I would buy it again.
5,best book ever,Dr. Rende is my theology teacher in high school and i think he is a very good teacher. He has a lot of knowledge and always has answers to our questions. He is very educated especially in theology so i am sure this book is very good and if filled with a lot of good information. So everyone should buy this book and you will learn a lot.
2,TAME TAME WEST,"I just couldn't get used to Will Smith as a cowboy. The whole thing just didn't seem genuine, therefore disconnecting you with the characters. Only a couple kewl parts, like when the man hiding in the portrait comes to life and tries to shoot West. Other than that, yawnfest U.S.A."
1,Don't watch,"When I was in middle school I believe and this movie was a hit, it was one of those things that breaks one's belief and hope in the species they are a part of. Why this movie, or the music from it proved a hit is nothing more than a testament to the idea that the earth might be better off being ran by cockroaches."
5,I LOVED IT!!,"It was a great movie. The only problem is that it was nothing like the show. I have this major crush on Kevin Kline so, of corse I wanted to see it. Dr. Lovless had been cut in half instead of being a midget. James West is between James Bond and John Wayne. Artimis Gorden is like, just cool. He hs all these little gizmos and gadgets that do, just about evrything. Everybody I know says it was a good movie and I agree full hartedly."
2,What in the Heck.....?,...my best compliment to this moovy is that I found the Will Smith video to be more entertaining than this vanity project. And that's saying a lot.
2,The script is virtually brain dead.,"Great wardrobe, cool sunglasses and colorful period costumes. Interesting special effects and authentic sets. Clearly, big budget. It is unfortunate that so much money was spent on such an inane (and occasionally offensive) screenplay. There is some serious cognitive dissonance in combining mass murder and comedy. They must have handed a blank check to Kevin Kline for his involvement. One star for the lavish production and effects and one star for the performances of Smith and Kline. They work well together and seem to have a good chemistry. It would be nice to see them together in a film worthy of their talent."
4,Big Willie Style,Will Smith makes this movie work. The scenes are excellent and the movie is super. The action is great and the soundtrack is awesome. As far DVDs go it is also a superb release with the many amenities it has to offer. It might not be as big a hit as his previous movies but it was definitely entertaining for family viewing. The opening scene was hillarious. Another winner for Big Willie Style.!
3,What a waste of good talent,I was severly disappointed in this movie. When you compare it to the original television show the movie looks like a joke. What happened to good writing? It was defently the Weird weird west.
4,"A good movie, The critics were wrong again.","I enjoyed this movie despite all of the negetivity that it got from the press. While I'm far too young to remember the original T.V. show I still think this movie did a great job. It did however seem a little too far-fetched at times. The whole deal with the mechanical spider was too much. But The whole idea of having the bad guys being a bunch of mad ex-confederates was great. They also made the film historically acurate, Grant was president in 1869 and that was the year the transcontinential railroads were finally joined in Utah. This is a movie anyone can watch. It is not overly or graphically violent, very little swearing, and its just plain fun to watch. I recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies to be entertained by them. Which in my opinion is their number one responsibility."
2,Good Movie? I DON'T THINK SO!,"I was really excited about seeing this movie. Some people said it wasgood and others said it was bad. I listened to the people who said itwas good. When it came out on video, I watched with my brother. Itreally stunk. The plot of the movie was very weak, and just to makethings worse, the bad guy was so stupid I knew at the first time I sawhim that this movie wasn't what I thought it was. It's basically aboutsex, breasts, and women's butts. It's a very dissapointing movie. Theonly reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is prettyfunny.Translation:DON'T BUY THIS....!Use your money onsomething good like The Matrix or Mission:Impossible."
1,My Mom Told me....,"My Mom told me if you can't say anything good about something,...... say nothing at all about it...OK, The acting wasn't horrible, but the talents of everyone involved seemed wasted. What a shame."
1,The worst movie in history period.,"The only thing I, have to say is if your out of sleeping medicine and can't get to sleep at night put this movie in and you'll be sleeping quickly.If there wasn't any laws on vandelism this movie would be burning or used as saturday picnic frizbee disks.A pathetic waste of film and money go spend your money at McDonald's it's better then spending it on this waste of time."
1,I did'nt like this Will Smith movie ever!,I think that it's not a comedy it is a cheezy sci-fi western adventure filmco-starring Kevin Kline. Why Bother not by enjoying it here I don't care really. My favorite has to be Men In Black with Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Now there's some excellent special effects and over the top hilarious laughter in that one!
1,The Worst Movie of All Time,"Wild Wild West was the worst movie I've ever seen(besides old sci-fi-movies, but those are funny). I was going to walk out of the movie but I kept saying to myself, ""It'll get better."" It got worse. The acting was horrid, and none of the jokes even worked. I think the funniest thing was the jokes about the half-man guy, whatever he was. I wouldn't even give this movie 1 star"
1,Not a success,"This movie was crudely done, with only bits and pieces of humor. This was too long, with crude humor and unnessary profanity. If only they cut that unnessary love scene out and made Smith and Kline less competitive and Salma Hayek less of a wimp, this would have been a lot better. Rated PG-13 for profanity, sexuality, and action-related violence."
1,"An example of script-writing gone horribly, horribly wrong!","The script killed this movie beyond redemption. A fine cast squandered. I found it incredibly boring, and I love Kevin Kline and Will Smith!"
1,bad,"This movie was hyped up so much that it just had to fail. The script was predictable, and even the acting was bad from every actor. I hate that wasted money on this movie. Guess it just shows you to: DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
1,Wild Wild Worst,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I saw it at the theater with my wife and at the conclusion she turned to me and said ""well THAT was a DUD"". I was thinking ""pile of manure"" myself. The bad things about the movie are as follows: script, acting, script, direction, script, ""special"" effects, script. Kenneth Branagh may never live this ""performance"" down. This ""movie"" recently won the Razzie for worst film of the year and it DESERVED it. Don't waste your time."
1,Worthless. A waste of carbon,"This is just a worthless movie. That's all there is to it. The only reason this got made is because Will Smith got popular after Men in Black and his stupid song from it. This is basically a really bad remake of Men in Black. While Men in Black was clever and funny in SOME parts, this movie has no redeeming qualities. It shouldn't even be considered a movie, it's just an attempt to cash in on Will Smith's popularity."
5,Why is this film rated so badly?,"Without wanting to insult anyone,I really don't get why this movie is rated so bad.I found it brilliant!The humour was great,the plot was very intersting too,and the special effects were state-of-the-art if you consider that this is a 90's fim.I also found this movie epic,having a friendly relationship growing between two guys that in the beggining hate each other,each of them being the star of the film on his own way."
1,Blows a good movie remake,What irks me most about this sorry film is that it blows the chance for a legitimate film version of the classic 60s TV series. There have been some very good and very bad remakes. This is in the very bad category and blows the chance for someone to do the TV series any justice in the future. Who's going to remake a WWW 2 or even watch it if it were made?
1,If I could only give it minus stars!,"The person who chose Will Smith to be James West ought to be shot! This is one of THE worst cases of miscasting ever to come out of the bowels of Hollywood. Will Smith couldn't hold a candle to Robert Conrad. I'd rather see someone like Jim Belushi or Vern Troyer (Mini Me) play Jim West than the overrated, no-talent Smith. Thankfully, this film was a bomb at the box office."
1,Pathetic,"Gee, I could have spent the seven bucks on something a little more entertaining, like a root canal."
1,Terrible,"If you loved the old TV series with Robert Conrad and Ross Martin, you will HATE this movie. I have always loved the old theme song to the TV show and they didn't even use that. I had looked forward to a remake. This wasn't it."
1,If I was king for a day........,"I would order every copy of this putrid pile of garbage destroyed. It would be no great loss if this ""film"" were lost forever. I simply cannot believe that Sonnenfeld thought this film was good enough to release. From the contrived, stupid, implausible plot to the forced comedy this movie was just about the worst I've ever seen. I only gave it a 1 star rating because I couldn't go lower. There's too much in this film to critique; but trust me, it's bad."
2,A miscast of a movie,"First off, I like Will Smith but he had no business being cast as James West (originally played by Robert Conrad in the 60's series).Now on the other hand Kevin Kline being cast as Artemus Gordon (master of disguise) is a little more accurate and to the mark.What I'm saying is if I was a film director remaking something fromanother's work,I would try to make it as close to their work as possible. However Mr.Sonnenfield mis-directed this movie,it's an ok film but if your expectations were as high as mine don't bother with this . Actually the only redeeming quality of this movie is Salma Hayek. Oh yeah Sonnenfield also missed the mark with the Dr.Loveless character which originally was played by a dwarf in the original series. Hell give me the project, the dollars and the actors of my choosing and I'll make a movie people would enjoyApologies for such a scathing revue. I hope Barry reads this!"
1,This Movie Is A Waste Of Tape,"This has to be the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. If there was an option to take away stars, I would give this movie a negative rating. I am embarassed for all the people that were involved this movie, including the guy that brought the crew donuts in the morning. Please refrain from purchasing this movie. The money saved can be sent to a more meaningful cause like hiring a lawyer to sue the producer of the movie, for making us watch this drivel. You get the idea."
1,Is this supposed to be sophistication?,"If you're an early adolescent (especially male) you may just like this film (No offense intended toward males over the age of fifteen). The rest will probably find it offensive, boring, and even embarrasing (poor Salma in those stupid pajamas). I could not finish watching this film out of sympathy for the actors."
1,Dissapointment,"I sorra, but I thought this was a pretty dumb movie. It was a bore so much that I couldn't follow it well enough. It does have some good music and Will Smith though!"
4,Great effects and IMAGINATION,If you like gadgets and gizmos then you'll like this movie alot. The creative use for the whole movie was greatly developed. I Like WWW because of the Creativity and imagination involved. Yes I was slightly disapointed but not like I was when I saw Starship Troopers. This movie doesn't deserve to be called worst movie of the summer.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"My expectations were not high when I hired this movie (I declined to see it on the big screen), but I was disappointed nevertheless. The beginning was very slow, and had I not paid $5 I would have stopped it then. It improved slightly as the film progressed, I almost enjoyed it at one point, but not for long enough. It was a very poor idea, and even the best of actors could not have made this one great."
2,Novel Potential,"""Nice-try"" remake of the original Wild Wild West TV series from the 1960's. Agents James West and Artemus Gordon are dispatched by President Grant to prevent the evil genius Dr. Loveless from carrying out a threat to fragment the integrity of the United States. The plot is good, but the cast and the scripting doesn't reach the potential of what this film could have been. Will Smith and Kevin Kline a little wacky and stray too far from the original characters portrayed by Robert Conrad and Ross Martin. The casting of Will Smith does not work well for fans who remember the original TV series: he appears too young to be an experienced agent, and his contemporary behavior detracts from the period setting. On the positive side, the machinery and inventions are entertaining with armored tanks, trains, and an 80-foot tall ""spider"" vehicle. Overall, it's an okay adventure movie, but doesn't hit the ""bulls-eye"" as a successful remake."
4,I like it:-P,"If you don't care about realism, don't care about historical accuracy, weren't a fan of the original show, and are obsessed with steam-powered gadgets and machinery that couldn't possibly work in the real world, this movie is awesome. I can understand why most people don't like it, but for me this movie is just fun to watch. I guess it appeals to my inner steampunk:-P"
3,Hmmmmmmm!,"Well, in my severe opinion,I expected this movie to be a little more (let's say) enjoyable. The only reason I'm giving the movie 3 stars is because it made me laugh (the part when Will and Kevin argue about a brest) and the last part of the movie, which is, to say, fun. Despuite that, the movie has a story, that only can be helped by the special effects. If you're a Will Smith fan, then this is your movie. If you're not, by the time the movie is over, you'll be unconscious or maybe even dead .... (kidding).Rent it and judge it first, don't let anyone influence or talk you into buying this movie; then buy it."
1,Unbelievably bad,"There's not much to say, except ""stay far, far away!"" There's so much hokum here, it's very tough to sit through the whole film. I guess one could expect some aberrant film selection from Kevin Kline, Wil Smith, or Salma Hayek, but Kenneth Branaugh.... shame on you!One of the worst films of recent memory."
4,People needed to take this movie more light heartedly,"Wild Wild West should have been taken with all the seriousness of an easy going action flick. Instead most people decided it had to live up to strict standards and expectations. The movie was funny! The jokes weren't laught-a-second in coming but most of them worked. The movie was pretty, even picturesque, to look at. Every set was nicely detailed and furnished, and visually the movie was convincing that it was in in 1800s. The plot was supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. I don't know why some people think its more believable that in Speed Keanu had to tip over a train to stop it, than this movie was. Simply letting the plot ease along is good for you! The acting was finely done. Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and Kenneth Branaugh are all fine actors who did a great job with the simple script and plot and made it all look easy, clever, and real."
2,Like a Throwback to an Earlier Time,"""'The Great Race' of the Nineties"" would best describe this exercise in overkill. Like that film, ""Casino Royale,"" ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and many of the other big-budgeted flicks of the late 1960's, ""Wild West West"" suffers from a poor script, an overemphasis on state-of-the-art special effects, a performance from Branagh that would make a first-year acting student cringe, and a lackluster turn from stars Smith and Kline.The only refreshing aspect of the film is Salma Hayek who tries her best to do much with very little...clothing, as well as dialogue."
3,"Not Enough to be ""Wild Wild"" . . .","As a big fan of the TV series, the movie doesn't destroy much, but as a movie in itself, it isn't as fascinating as it wants to be. The only redeeming thing about this film is Kevin Kline because it's evident on screen that he's just out to have fun with the somewhat mundane material he has. That in itself was enough to let me sit through it. It's too bad that Sonnenfeld was out to make a ""Contraption Comedy"" with ideas that could have been more. A good TV series to make as a movie, but the effort felt half-hearted."
2,Who Wastes Money On This?,"I would recommend this DVD only for the interactive menus and numerous extras, including Making Of.I have never seen the original Wild Wild West, but I can tell this movie doesn't live up to the predesscor. First of all, Will Smith needs to choose roles that will gurantee a box office smash. Last time I heard, this film bombed at the national theaters. The chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin Kline isn't just there. Also, Salma Hayek in the role of an entertainer just isn't perfect. The director should have done a better job, along with the people who wrote the script. The one liners don't carry us through the whole movie, even with Will Smith's slick dialogue and Kevin Kline's wittiness in acting."
1,This makes you angry!,"First,I'd like to say that this movie is terrible. I saw this movie in the theater with my friend. And when we finished seeing the movie, we were discouraged. I could't say anything. I think I don't want increase victims like me.Seeing this movie is waste of time,and makes you angry I guess."
1,the way not to do a movie about a t.v. show,"first they cast a black man as an undercover agent in the wild west where he would never be able to help as they would never let him in most places. remember this was before political correctiness or civil rights. then they turn one of the best villins on t.v. into a racist man missing most of his body. then they add state of the art f/x and think they have a great movie. it's pure trash and gets one star because you can't give no stars. a waste and you should see the t.v. show if you want to see this concept really work well. just not good at all, a mess."
2,Wild Wild Miscasting,"""Wild Wild West"" is not a total fiasco, but it's easy to see why this big-budget revamp of the classic TV show never clicked. Simply put, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are not Robert Conrad and Ross Martin. There's no chemistry or rapport between Fresh Prince and Shakespeare Boy, which seriously damages the film's potential. Kenneth Branagh - for all his talents - doesn't hold a candle to Michael Dunn's original Dr. Loveless. Despite its impressive set design and visual effects, ""Wild Wild West"" falls flat. Here's some helpful advice to producers planning big-screen remakes of 1960s TV shows: If you cannot find the right actors, don't bother."
1,How the West Was Done (In),"If this bloated, unfunny, offensive, ill-conceived dud doesn't spell the end of the Western, I don't know what will. Will Smith's usually winning personality falls completely flat here, and Mr. Kline is equally lousy in the role that calls for him to do little except dress up in drag that makes him look even worse than Kurt Russell did in ""Tango & Cash"". Barry Sonnenfeld displays none of the wit that he used to such great effect in ""Men In Black"" and (especially) ""Get Shorty""."
1,Don't Bother,"This was one of the very few films that I have stopped, rewound and slid back in the case before it was over. I thought this film would be a fun trip into fantasyland with crazy things and zany people, not to be taken seriously, just a lot of crazy zany fun. Well, it didn't even do that, it was bad folks, baaad. And movies have to be pretty bad for me to shut them down. Will Smith was not convincing in his character as he also was not convincing in his roles in ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"". He looks much too young for these characters and shows not an once of maturity in his lines and actions. If he acted more mature, it could help offset his youthful looks. Its like watching a little boy playing grown up characters. Perhaps thats what turned me off ""Wild Wild West"". Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Absolutely the most astoundingly,"lousy movie of the year.Make that the decade. . . do I hear century? Millennium? OK, Will Smith I can believe. . but Kevin Kline is SO FAR above this tripe, I feel sorry for him having his name on it."
1,Disgrace,"The person who wrote this, even the person who THOUGHT of making this movie should be banned from EVER going into Hollywood ever again!I must agree with ""viewer from the moon"". An African-American raised by Native Americans is a Secret Service agent *right* after the civil war? Sounds like something that *should've* happened in the past, but is COMPLETELY ridiculous. Don't give this movie your time."
1,Wild Wild West?! Should have been Wild Wild Waste!!,"I saw the previews for this movie and couldn't wait to see it. I should have saved my money and caught it on cable (since I pay for that service anyway). I like Will Smith and can see he was the only reason for anyone to go see this movie. Although the chemistry between Smith and Kevin Kline was good, it wasn't enough to save this bomb. The only good thing about this movie was the ""Wild Wild West"" video. If the entire movie was half as good as the video, it would be worth buying. At this point, it doesn't look like ""Wild Wild West"" will joining my video library."
1,Worst Movie of the summer,"i USUALLY dont hAVE high excpectations for summer movies,but even compared to other reALLY BAD SUMMer movies this was just plain awful"
3,enjoyable,"good western/science fiction/comedy movie; some parts & language questionable for younger children, but overall a funny family movie"
4,For The Fun Of It,"To enjoy this movie you need to suspend disbelief and go along for the wild ride. It is a fun, fantastical film. Just sit back, relax, and watch for the fun of it."
4,"A thrilling, enjoyable movie.","I thought that wild wild west was an oustanding movie. THough many of my fellow colleagues have seen it, they don't seem to have the same perspective as I do. I love Salma Hayek and I also love Willm Smith. They are two great actors. I found this a thrilling, enjoyably movie."
3,Wild Wild West,"Ilike wild wild west as a kid on tv but like the moive but there was some thing missing, from the moive."
4,WWW,"Came brand new in packaging, works great. Great movie. Had to have it for my collection. Great buy for the money"
3,Review,"The product has a few minor scratches and the box was damaged, but the DVD runs as far as I know. It is a Christmas gift for my hubby, so we haven't been able to watch it yet! :) VERY fast shipping!"
2,.........,what was going through sonnenfelds head when he filmed the third act of this thing? It looks like they cut alot of stuff out of it at for the final.The only thing worth rembering is that glimpse of salma hayeks butt.
3,Warning has almost nothing to do with the TV Series.,"In fact, I think there are exactly 4 similarities between Wild Wild West the movie and the TV-Showthose 4 are:James West's name Artemis Gordon's name Dr Loveless' Name President Grant's name.The Characters themselve are all radically different, and The Story is not a story you would have seen in the TV Series.In short this is the _Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves_ version of Wild Wild West. What do I mean? Just this, that if you can forget everything about the CHaracters this is _supposed_ to be about, you actually have a decent movie.If you never watched _The Wild Wild West_ on TV, or if you can forget that this is supposed to be based on the TV series you can really enjoy this movie."
3,"Dumb, but....","Okay, so maybe Will Smith is not believable as a Cowboy. So what? The secret to watching this movie is to not take it seriously. It's just meant to be fun."
3,Could have been much better,"Big missed opportunity! This movie had so much potential. It seems as if the writers didn't give much thought to the plot. Many parts seem ""thrown in"", as if we have to show this so lets put it in. If they had just worried about telling a good story and not about having to show this character doing X and another character doing Y it could have been a terrific movie. You may enjoy it once, however, you probably wouldn't want to see it again."
4,GREAT MOVIE FOR THE YOUNG ONES!,"IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE THEN YOUR HATING ON WILL SMITH.HE'S DONE IT ALL.I CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE SAY IT WAS HORRIBLE.THEY ONLY SAID THAT CAUSE OF THE NEW AGE INVENTIONS LIKE THE GIANT SPIDER,ALL THE REST OF THE GAGETS THAT WERE USED.BUT THIS MOVIE IS MAINLY FOR THE KIDS AGES 6 AND UP.ADULTS CAN'T WATCH THIS MOVIE AND THEY CAN'T JUDGE IT EITHER.A GOOD MOVIE TO ADULTS IS STIGMATA,SAVING PRIVATE RYAN THOSE ARE ADULT MOVIES.I DON'T THINK THIS MOVIE WAS MADE FOR THE KIDS IT WAS MADE FOR ALL KINDS OF AGES BUT IT SHOULD OF BEEN MADE FOR THE KIDS.BUY IT FOR YOUR KIDS."
2,Sucked!,"Hollywood can be so cruel. They hype up all the bad summer movies, but this one would've been terrible without all the merchandising. Avoid it. Even the ultimate team of Kevin Kline and Will Smith (two exceptional actors) can't save it."
2,"Great DVD, 2 Star Movie!","Wild Wild West as a movie is fair. Not exactly horrible, but not great. As for the DVD, it's great! Enough extras to satisfy me and the DVD transfer is very good. Going back to the movie, I'll have to say this: the acting was good, the special-effects good, the plot bad, the villain: Very Annoying! I forget who played the villain, but I have to say that he didn't act well in this movie, his accent was fake, and you weren't even scared of him. Villains are supposed to be scary OR a villain can be funny and frightening(as in Men In Black), but this villain lacks both qualities. Plus, this movie was supposed to be a comedy-action, but it wasn't funny. But still, the DVD's good and it's good when you just want to sit down and watch a movie."
3,Wild Wild West,"thought there should have been more to a plot, looked like they were just trying to give a lot of action shots..."
2,Wild Wild Waste,"Good talent gone to waste with a dreadful script. It's supposed to be humerous and off the wall, but nothing seems to work, the gags, the clever effects, and expensive production all gone to waste! You'd think someone would have picked this up on the rushes! Anyhow, 2 stars for the expensive sets and game try by the cast!"
2,Wild Wild West Turns Out A Mild Mild Mess,"It has to be the worst movie of the summer. Will Smith has taken home the summer box-office with ID4 and Men in Black. He has now taken home disappointment, and so have I. The bad thing about Wild Wild West is that it's not funny. The humor is not there. Which for this movie was greatly needed. The loud razzle-dazzle special effects weren't needed. The script has more holes than Mr. West himself could shoot. Well, all in all: it needs improvement. Wait for it to be aired on ABC."
2,Wild Wild Wusses!,"This is another one of those summer films that drew in countless numbers of innocent people by way of a huge advertising blitz. This flick was especially disappointing to fans of the old sixties TV show who couldn't help but make comparisons of Will Smith to Robert Conrad. The film is entertaining and funny only to those who either temporarily discard their education and common sense or have no education or common sense at all. The acting isn't really the greatest and the plot is so puerile and senseless; Kenneth Branagh's character Dr. Arliss Loveless certainly could have done better than build a large, awkward, clumsy, spider-like machine to take over the post civil war United States. This is just another one of those big budget sci-fi flicks that will appeal to a Saturday morning television audience in the future (with a little censorship, of course)."
2,Wildly boring,"From what I've heard about it, I thought it was going to be something exceptional. Nothing new. I don't know why it got the hype in the first place. The best thing about it was the jokes. In fact, they're enough reason for you to see the movie."
1,Run far far away,"When I lived in Santa Fe,parts of the movie were being filmed at a ranch outside the city.There was a fire on the set---which sounds prophetic.It foretold a disaster.I've seen the first 20 minutes&last; 20 minutes of this movie,since the rest is unwatchable.In fact,these segments are unwatchable.There's a gross scene involving a head (even Will Smith looks like he's about to vomit).Kenneth Branagh has tons of awful make-up that would put Tammy Faye Bakker to shame&an; unconvincing moustache.The dialogue between Smith&Branagh; is made up of terrible racist&impotence; jokes.Branagh,after all,has a bevy of scantily-clad beauties.The final scenes are one looooong chase scene.Ohh,the agony!Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Not so 'Wild Wild West',"The worst movie before ""Battlefield Earth."" It's truly awful. Based on the 1960's TV show, the movie has nothing to do with the show. Will Smith plays James West, a secret agent man and Kevin Kline is his silly sidekick. The president who is also played by Kline, put the two men together to find a crazy Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Who cares!? This movie is so stupid, I thought it was ""Dumb & Dumber 2."" Pure poo in a bucket. Then take the bucket and put it over a doorway so one of these characters can open the door with a dropping surprise! Oh man, they even threw in Salma Hayek (who is usually good), but smelled everything up in this movie. Insanely disappointing mount of garbage that deserves to be tossed away."
1,A painful movie experience.,"I would rather have a root canal than ever see this movie again. Words cannot describe how bad it was. Will Smith as Jim West??? What lame brain idiotic moron cast this film? What's next, Will Smith as James Bond? Or, how about, Will Smith as Capt. Kirk of the starship Enterprise.Thinking of purchasing this trash? Save time, just burn your money."
3,Not THAT bad.,"Okay, look. This movie isn't going to win any awards or anything, but it was NOT the wreck that everbody says it is. I've seen far worse. Will Smith is amiable as always, Kevin Kline is decent in his supporting role, and Branagh makes a cool villain. The F/X are well done and the DVD has a ton of extras. The down side is that the dialog is cheesy at times and Selma Hyek seems to have no real purpose. But, other than that, its fairly entertaining. Just check your brain before viewing and you'll be fine."
1,return before opening!,i bought it as a christmas gift for my brother. all who viewed it concluded it was a waste of time AND money! a bad will smith movie (if you can believe that! ) i have seen the tv show the movie was based on and it is more believable than this movie! WAIT UNTIL ITS ON THE NETWORKS! one highlight-SALMA HYACK! (the one star is for her!)
4,Cooking leads to romance...,"My husband (the chef) and I saw the movie preview of ""Mostly Martha"" on Wed. If you have any knowledge about the culinary world - you will truly enjoy this movie. A female chef who is independent and sucessful encounters some obstacles and realizes ""life doesn't have a recipe"" which she can follow.The movie has subtitles."
5,My personal Favorite!,"Our German class had to watch this movie which is where I fell in love with in. Being a now 3rd year culinary student minoring in German language, I could watch this beautiful movie constantly!"
5,"Subtle directing, sublime acting and soundrack,","I'd like to add to what others have said about this film that (a) the acting is wonderful (especially Martina Gedeck as Martha and Maxime Foerste as Lina) and (b) the soundtrack is absolutely sublime.In fact, the reason I bought the DVD was that reportedly there was quite a lot of Keith Jarrett on the soundtrack, and there is, to great effect. Material from the Norwegian Quartet, the Bregenz solo concert and the trio albums Tribute and Standards Volume 2 is all used, and it combines with the film quite beautifully.But in the end, it wasn't just the soundtrack that entranced me, but the whole film. And anyone who buys into the absurd stereotype of the lack of German humour should see this to realise how wrong they are.WOnderful!"
4,refreshing german movie,"If you can get over the bad lighting and the horrible saxophone music, this movie will surely touch you. I am looking forward to the english version with Katherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart!"
5,Mostly Marvelous,"Mostly Martha had suberb actors, laughter, tears, and exciting and sumptuous cooking scenes. Keith Jarrett's music had a wonderful beat that worked brilliantly with the story line. Seeing this movie was a special way to spend an evening."
4,"I have to say, I LOVED this movie!","I rented the movie without realizing that it was in German. The minute I put the movie in I thought there would be NO WAY that I would enjoy it. Wrong! I loved it and I plan on adding it to my DVD library. Excellent acting, excellent music, excellent movie."
5,Charming,This story of Martha and her kitchen are a great edition to anyone's film collection. The addition of her deceased sisters child rocks Martha's world in many ways. I do not think enough of the reviews focus on this fragile relationship. Lina and Martha's relationship mirrors the relationship with the talented Italian chef. Both relationships are new and frightening to the lead.This movie has charmed me and captured me. I m sure it will capture every person who see's it.
3,He sees dead people,"Dr. Mitchell Gibson is a retired board-certified forensic psychiatrist and author who has studied the spiritual world, including the afterlife for over 20 years. His passion is teaching people spirituality, and he has ""seen dead people"" and had other paranormal visions since before he was 7 years old. This lecture with slides was filmed live at the Seventh International Conference on Science & Consciousness in 2005. The videograper's skill is rudimentary, but Dr. Gibson is a friendly and easy to follow speaker."
2,lacking professionalism,"Doesn't seem like it would be something on a video, but more in a classroom, very unprofessional, something one would see on power-point; including the information, which could not be challenged."
4,An Easy Read,"Money and fame can't keep former football star and current TV sportscaster, Eric Swift, from falling into the dark trap of drug addiction. In fact, they contribute to it. Can the love of a strong family, and a righteous woman, save him? This contemporoary story is all the most interesting for being told from the male point of view."
4,Survey research,This is a great book to for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of survey research. It is easily understood and contains a lot of valuable information and good references.
3,not what I expected,"I'd been eyeing this book for a few years, the reviews and advertisements suggested it was (well, I interpreted it to mean) a self help medical book. It isn't exactly. I was surprised to see many invasive therapies mentioned although it does include treatments that are readily available and can be used at home. I've found it interesting, I learnt a few things, I found it mostly disappointing, but then again I was expecting 'self help' treatments to dominate. Medical breakthroughs are the emphasis. Forbidden treatments, well, when was this written? maybe not so forbidden now, but then that depends on how informed you are already. The book guides you to a website, password protected, that provides updated information - that's good! But, if you're like me and expecting a book about medical self help, don't buy it. If you're interested in learning about what treatments are available for certain conditions, then by all means buy it."
1,no fit,"this 3 wire replacement does not fit my existing 4 pin socket (for california) 99 subaru legacy (brighton 2.2l engine) as stated by amazon's ""find parts"" system to be 100% correct fit. bummer."
4,What a musical should be!,"I admit I never saw the stage musical so the plot and characters were new to me. Nonetheless, Chicago is a rollicking, foot-tapping, hot musical that doesn't apologize for its direction and content. Roxie Hart is a naive but strong-willed young woman who's determined to be famous. Velma Kelly is a veteran of the stage but is sparsely rewarded despite her dedication and talent. The two eventually collide when Roxie begins winning hearts (and the press) with her story while Velma must face the reality that she's yesterday's news. The slick lawyer not only must juggle Roxie's front page case but also the restless Kelly who is chagrined that even her own attorney begins to turn his back on her. This movie is not for everyone, musicals rarely are, but to those who enjoy a well-developed story with never boring characters this film is a must. A well-deserved best picture nod."
5,Grrrrrreat!,The Incredible Hulk died in this 1990 TV movie that was to be followed by another TV movie called Rebirth of the Hulk or something to that nature. But the excellent Bill Bixby became too ill.Grrrrreat movie
4,Bill Bixby will be missed as David Banner!,The Death of the Incredible Hulk (1990) is Bill Bixby's last movie as David Banner and he directed this made for TV movie! The Death of the Incredible Hulk is Bill Bixby's last film as David Bruce Banner. No one could play David Banner better than he can. Elizabeth Gracen is also good as Jasmine. Lou Ferrigno is the Hulk period. The New Hulk CGI movies don't compare to the original Incredible Hulk TV movies. The Incredible Hulk dies at the end of the movie and David Banner will finally Rest in Peace. Bill Bixby will be remembered.I remember when this TV movie aired on NBC television back in the 1990s. A
5,An Incredible ending ...too bad there wasn't a sequel,Unlike a lot of reviews I think it could have went on without Bill Bixby. Couldn't Banner have plastic surgery to keep the authorities off his trail? I was hoping that Lou Ferrigno would have thought of this idea because as a TV movie it still could have held up. I would have liked to see the screenplay for the sequel. I wonder if it's available on the web. I would have loved to have seen what Bixby had intended for future movies. It's too bad that this didn't go on because the TV movies were better than a lot of the series. It was basically hit or miss for the four and a half years they were on the air. With the TV movies the stakes were higher and the quality was better. The Hulk in the TV movies seemed to be more like the one in the comic and I have to say dispite all the CGI in the world the movie won't match what Bixby did in the series.
2,What a Shame,"I would have to call this a very lackluster finale to what was an otherwise amazing run for the Incredible Hulk. The original TV series seemed to be the standard that none of the later made-for-tv movies could touch. ""Trial of.."" and ""The Return of..."" both seemed to lack the production quality of the series - and this movie was even worse in that regard.The death of such an awe-inspiring character as the Incredible Hulk should have been part of a far better-written and better-developed script. This movie just doesn't do it for me. The acting is below par and the story drags along predictably. Nothing about this will raise your eyebrows...Pick this movie up if you're trying to collect as much Hulk footage as possible - otherwise, don't bother. You will most likely not watch it more than once."
2,"A PRETTY SAD ENDING TO A FUN SERIES!... ""HULK DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS!""","Well I've finally completed the entire Incredible Hulk TV series and the three TV movies and I must say the last film is a pretty lackluster effort.The film is quite boring with way too much ""mumbo jumbo"" to be enjoyed on a fun level. While it's nice to see a cap on the show, the ending is rather unsatisfying and leaves the viewer a little disappointed.The DVD transfer is pretty good, but the only extras are a few Marvel movie trailers.....too bad....Hulk deserve better than this!Hulk Mad! :-("
3,Best of the t.v. movies...but still not that great,"As a fan of the original series, I have to say I was disappointed in the first two reunion movies. Trying to incorporate other Marvel characters into the (reasonably) ""real"" universe of the Bixby series just didn't work. OK, so this movie isn't terribly believable either, but Bixby gives his usual credible performance and the plot doesn't simply rehash the David Banner-on-the-run formula. In fact, as Banner himself comments, he actually gets to SEE his alter-ego for the first time (via videotape). And that's the real appeal of this surprisingly affecting story...not the dumb terrorist subplot.A sad end to a wonderful character, but certainly worth watching."
1,garbage,"After the great overall quality of the entire series and two later movies with thor and daredevil as guest stars, death of the hulk is a complete failure. Hulk dies from a bad fall? whaat?!?! That aside, its low budget unwatchable tripe, very embarrassing. Thought i'd save some coin just watching it on you tube, but I lost an hour of time, so don't make the mistake I made. After watching the series and the thor daredevil movies, I suggest pretending those were the last hulk movies made until the ang lee hulk."
4,OK,"If you are a fan then it is must but be aware it is mono and was not digitally mastered, yo will get the feeling as if you were in the early 80s"
3,Bombastic movie without extras,"Since I also own the complete Incredible Hulk tv series starring Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno and Jack Colvin, I decided to look out for the three movies that followed the series.I don't know if the other two movies (The Return of The Incredible Hulk/The Trial of The Incredible Hulk) have subtitles, so I went for this one.Good things first: The colors of the movie on DVD are vivid and the edges sharp and clear. However one needs a good DVD player software to get the best out of it. The packaging of the DVDis also quite attractive and the DVD can be taken out quite easily.Bad things: There are no extras whatsoever. Hopefully if and when the movies come out on BluRay, there are tons of extras like audio commentary, Making of, etc.For people who are only interested in the movie and nothing else this is certainly a must have, all the others should wait for BluRay, if and when it comes."
4,good but not complete,"Overall a good movie. However, Jack McGee is no where to be found- that subplot was never tied in."
3,"It's not called the Death of, for no reason!","Now, I thought that David Banner was going to cure himself of this metamorphosis. That is what I thought the title of the movie means. Ridding himself of the creature has always been his goal. That was what he had in mind in the movie but the experiment backfired. Overall, the film was good. There are a few surprises. There are some sad moments so be sure to prepare for some drama."
3,rEVIEW OF THE HULK,i THINK that THE dEATH OF THe hULK MOVIE WAS NOT GOOD AS iT COULD HAVE BEEN. tHE TV Series was much better than the movies that are out about the hulk.
4,The Incredible Hulk is back in his biggest adventure yet!,"12 years after his first transformation, Dr.David Banner is now working as a janitor at a top secret research faculty. There is eguipment there that may cure him once and for all.When a woman is forced to work for terroists in order to save her sister, she lights fire to the lab, but as she is not a killer, drags one of David's friends, who is helping him cure his condition, to safety. When the terrorits attack, she finds out that her sister does not care, and she is just a hardened criminal. Then her sister and a pilot try to run her over with their plane. David sees this and jumps aboard as the Hulk. The plane explodes and the Hulk falls to the ground and soon dies,But as David, not the creature . I cried at the end of this one. But I have a few words to say: ""Rest In Peace: David Banner"""
4,Great for planning a hospital VBAC,"Natural Childbirth After Cesarean begins (as most books on the VBAC subject do) by refuting the old wive's tales...ruptured uterus, vaginal breech deliveries dangerous, etc. I am pleased with the fact that both writers are speaking from experience and not just medical or personal opinion (not all authors on this subject can say the same). On a more personal level, this book made me search out my own reasons for wanting a VBAC and emphasized that knowing this reason is crucial to the success of the birth. However, as someone considering home birth I thought that the book was a little too ""pro-hospital"" and mentioned a home birth only for those ""extremists"". This view was not backed up with any research but stemmed from personal opinion,which was a little disappointing. This aside, this book should be included in your ""top ten"" list as you do your VBAC research."
2,Natural Childbirth After Cesarean: A Practical Guide,"Has some nice stories, but this book is about anything BUT natural childbirth VBAC. HEAVILY medicalized, and not very encouraging in a womans ability to birth normally after cesarean. If you want a hospital birth with maximum drugs, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money and time and just read Birthing From Within!"
5,Amazingly Insightful - Excellently Translated & Explained,"The Pillow Book by Sei Shonagon is a very old diary/journal of a woman in court life in ancient Japan. The translation with all the helpful hints by Ivan Morris is excellent - I was never at a loss to what was happening. With Ivan's help Sei brings back to life 1000 years ago in Japan. Her writings are her observations to life around her. Sei talks about court life, people who surround her & simple pleasures (like observing the moon and writing poetry). Often times her writings are no more than pure gossip giving the book a true life as if she was writing just last week. For the casual reader it is well worth the enjoyment of a ""Pillow Book"" - for those interested in Japanese History it is a must!"
5,A Fresh view of an ancient World,"This book opens a window on a vanished world. Yet, because the lady who wrote the book writes what she believes a private volume we get to see her world warts and all.In many ways it shows that while society may change, and people are shaped by their culture, what it comes down to in the end is that we are still human beings.I can't think of a volume from western litrature of this age written by women. This is proof is you ever needed it that Japan truly is a land of ancient cultured people. Thankfully one that has preserved at least some of what they knew."
1,Don't know english to gwell,A very interesting book very ing depth. I thurully enjoy it. English 3 months studying now. It good practice to lerns and complicate it. I go to sleep on pillow now ha ha.. I love this country!
5,Machiavelli never had it so good.,"Sei Shonagon and her contemporary Murasaki Shikibu both led fascinating but restricted lives. But reading the diary of Sei Shonagon gives the outside world a glimpse of the courtly intrigue that thrived in her world. It almost reads like fabulous fiction, but it isn't. Great insight into the world of Heian Japan."
3,"Not enough room for extra mouthpiece, single student book or valve oil","I got this case because it was inexpensive and the reviews were good. It is a good case its just too small inside where you need room for a couple of things the student trupetier carries with his trumpet such as a comic book sized music book, slide grease and valve oil."
4,Dub on the way,"During their panel at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2011 Sentai announed that they are producting a dubb for Princess Ressurrection, don't know the cast and don't know when the billingal version will be out.UPDATEThe Billingal vesrion is set to release on Janurary 17, 2012."
4,"Long, but worthwhile","Surprisingly enough, Brad Pitt didn't compromise this film! I always question the use of big name actors in important movies. Yes, I consider this to be an important movie. Every time I watch it, I am overcome with the beauty and tragedy of Tibet, the wondrous mystery of Tibetan Buddhism and the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. It's a true account, which chronicles the experiences of Heinrich Harrer. His transformation parallels that of the Tibetans who regularly make the pilgrimage to Lhasa for spiritual purification. This DVD has no extras at all, but worth the price for the film alone. The transfer to digital is good. It would've been nice to have some information on the true account of Harrer as well as info on the Chinese occupation of Tibet. You might also wish to check out the soundtrack featuring Yo-Yo Ma."
3,Seven Year Itch,"Seven Years in Tibet can sometimes feel like seven hours at the top of the world. I mean, just how many snow-capped Tibetan peaks can a person take in one sitting. There's a solid heart pumping here, but director Jean-Jacques Annaud wrestles with too many themes and Pitt is strangely distant, maybe even miscast. There is an emotional element missing, and you can't tell whether it's Pitt, the script, or what. And when Heinrich's Seven Years in Tibet are up and the Chinese begin their brutal occupation of this primal and mysterious country, you leave with him but feel nothing. His epic journey to enlightenment seems shallow and uninvolving. Sorry, Brad, no nirvana this time."
4,HEROIC,"I had been avoiding this movie until I finally broke down,bought a DVD player and rented ""Seven Years In Tibet"". Brad Pitt was the reason I had been avoiding it, and I'm here to say right now that was stupid of me. He may only be an adequate actor at best, but this is a fine tale, coupled with mezmerizing cinematography and a noble portrait of the Tibetan people and their spiritual leader, the Dali Lama."
1,The Ruination a Great Story,Read the book. The movie fictionalized and altered a wonderful (and true) story that deserved a better movie representation. The book was excellent. This movie could have been so much better if it followed the book more closely. It's a real shame.Seven Years in Tibet
3,Brad Pitt is impossible.,"If it weren't for Brad Pitt warbling his way through this movie with a bad german accent, it might have actually been enjoyable. The cinematography is gorgeous, with long spans of geographic beauty. The storyline is reasonably gripping as well, recounting Tibetan history, the lines of friendship, and ultimate self enlightenment. But ruining the integrity of Seven Years in Tibet is that rotten Brad Pitt, who stumbles in with a performance that runs the gamut from mildly irritating to gratingly painful.Sad but true: Mr. Pitt makes this movie extremely difficult to watch."
4,A great movie for all to see,"I would give this movie four stars for two reasons. The first is the obvious, the story and the setting are beautiful. The combination of the Dalai Lama and a jerk of a mountain climber make it a contradicting movie. Also, this movie is important because it shows in a very real way the things that China did to Tibet. I had never heard of this story before I saw this movie, and I'm sure that many others hadn't either. It is an important story that needs to be told, and this movie is the perfect way to grab the attention of many people."
3,Semi-interesting.,"I'm pretty sure this a really good movie.For some reason though, I just couldn't get into it. There were times when the dialogue was interesting, but then it would switch to a scene that would totally throw me off.The setting was extremely beautiful, and the acting, from what I saw was very good.I'm not going to bash this movie simply because I alone didn't understand it. It wouldn't be fair. I will concede that maybe I didn't watch it enough (only 1-and-a-half times) to really understand it.With that said, I give ""Seven Years In Tibet"" 3 1/2 stars. Maybe later, if and when I watch it again, it will go up to four or maybe even five stars for me and I will post it then."
2,Not what I'd expect from Brad,"I think Brad should stick to funny, action adventure and love stories....I suppose this was just too dragging for the typical viewer who is looking for some cute boys and breathtaking action scenes. On the other hand for someone looking for something out of the ordinary this is for you."
1,They should have called the movie two guys in Tibet.,The only thing this movie had in common with the book was there were two guys in Tibet. If you want to enjoy this movie don't read the book first. You'll be very disappointed if you know the true story of what really happened. Very poor! Why can't Hollywood seem to ever get a story straight?
3,Movie Shows a Changed Perspective,"A little dragging in parts, overall the movie was fair. I didn't see why everyone raved about Pitt's acting in reviews, but understood the movie was about a change of heart. I wouldn't recommend it for people to run out and rent or buy, but if it's on a station already, it wouldn't be a loss to take a gander."
3,An enjoyable film,"Although I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt, the subject matter of this film was of great interest to me.Harrer's (Pitt) transformation was interesting, but I though his supporting cast was more thoroughly developed by Annaud, and carried the film.Excellent mountaineering scenes at the beginning of the story."
5,"Excellent movie, great quality","I have always been impressed with this movie. Following the life of a man completely absorbed in his own life of conquest and greatness, scared of fatherhood, and lost in his heart, this movie is a classic. The growth of Heinrich as a human being is phenomenal to witness; the simple beauty of his relationship with the Dalai Lama is incredible and inspiring.The quality was excellent (no graining or other effects of poorly rendered Blu-Rays).I always enjoy popping this movie into the player."
1,Did not get to see it.,"The tape popped in my VCR. My VCR is brand new, so i do not know what happened. I must say, i ordered it for a friend, so neither one of us got to see it. i only hate the fact that it broke, and i did pay for it."
3,Could have been great...,"The Dalai Lama is dear to my heart.I wish this great story couldhave been told without Brad Pitt.His acting, accent, and glam shotsdetracted from the experience for me.I do, however, honor Brad for hismany philanthropic endeavors."
4,Don't let the face on the cover fool you!,"I have to admit Seven Years in Tibet will go down in the annals of history as something of a great story, and the movie will become part of that. There are beautiful scenes and wonderful parts to this modification of Harrer's original story. I wish they had somebody who could stay in character better than Pitt, who seemed to want to break back into a Hollywood tough-guy character every other line. All in all, this is very good at portraying another side of the war. Few people could say they didn't learn something new without reading the book or seeing the movie - whether it be just facts or a lesson about life. The child who played the Dalai Lama was brilliant and showed his innocence and strengths at the same time. At times I was reminded of Little Buddha. See the movie or read the book - you will be wiser and happier when done."
2,nice,"nice pictures / scenes of Tibet - very interesting - but the story is kind of boring, so not sure if I would recommend it - a national geographic one maybe better :)"
2,"Mothers, this is a Great film for children at Nap Time~","Come on.... I thought that it would be a good movie, and believe me, I am a Brad Pitt fan, but this movie can put one to sleep. This movie portrays a mountain climber (Pitt) who is assigned to climb the Himalayas for the Nazis in WW2, and ends up becoming a prisoner of war. It shows how Bradd Pitt escapes the P.O.W. Camp and flees to Tibet's Holy City, Lhasa, to end up becoming HH the Dhalai Lhama's Private Tutor, and friend. Yeah right, I'm sure you are jumping to your feet right now. This'll sure keep you busy if you are prepared to watch almost 3 hours of a non-action, unrealistic film, even though the story is true."
4,Tibet.....You Bet,Brad Pitt is most enjoyable to watch as he discovers the wonders of WWII Tibet. The scenery is wonderful and the story is amazing. You will love this movie.
1,I renamed this movie Seven Years in my Seat!,"This movie was so boring. The scenery was okay, but the rest of the movie was horrible. And as for that fake Austrailian accent...what was Brad Pitt thinking?"
1,Ironic issue,"The fact is simple that most of Americans know nothing about Tibet.This country liberated itself from Britain but inherited many colonial scars from Britan as the Tibitan issue.This country fought a civil war for slavery, but unconciously sympathetic to the ghost of the most notorious slavery society: Dalai Lama.What an irony!Pitt seems brighter than the Play Girl icon and religion-lost R. Gear, but his taking of this role appears culturely illiterate."
1,propaganda,"This film is a kind of propaganda. Historycally and oviously, Tibet has been a part of China for a thousand years and Tibetean is one of Chinese group. Now Tibetian redidents create great culture and Chinese people respect them."
4,Pretty good henna for that price,"This package was, as the title says, pretty good for that price. It was hard to apply it because it was pretty thick and the applicator wasn't great, but overall, it was good to use as a first timer before using more expensive henna."
2,Ok for fun...,This kit is ok for if you're just doing henna for fun but its too loose and drains down ruining the art work.
4,Original recordings...,"...no, not by the Artists who made the songs famous (and to be fair...it is not advertised with any names so I do not think it is misleading). The sound quailty is very professional and a lot of the songs are a little edgier than the original recordings (which I liked). Great price for so many songs."
1,Horrible,"This CD is terrible. I thought this would be the type of CD a church worship team might produce. I was so wrong. If you want a techno/hip-hop/rock/pop version of your favorite worship songs, this is it. I felt bad, but after I got over the initial anger at having spent money on this CD, my husband and I sat around and laughed at how ridiculously bad it was. I think Shaggy made an appearance in one of the songs."
5,Why didn't I buy this book sooner ?,"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. Anyone even thinking about entering the garment world should seriously look at investing in this book. It offers some very, open ,frank observations and information about the garment world.This book is not just for novices.It shares some very sage advice for ""seasoned"" veterans too. I am just thinking of ways to get my colleagues to read it, without hurting their feelings. Contains extremely good reference material as well."
5,Mandatory on the desktop of every sewn products manufacturer,"Ms. Fasanella has done a masterful job of tying the critical fundamentals of manufacturing to the unique performance drivers of the sewn products business. It is too bad the manufacturers in every segment don't have a reference like this one. Not only should this book be read by every business owner and manager in the sewn products industry, it should be kept at their fingertips for ongoing reference.It has been a distinct privelege for me to have a chance to read and review this book. Between the book and her web site, Kathleen Fasanella is an extraordinarily valuable resource for those fighting the tough battle of keeping the sewn products industry alive and flourishing in the U.S. in the face of such strong competition from overseas. This book will serve as an indispensable weapon in that fight, and will long be regarded as one of the greatest conributions to American success."
1,I would not buy this book.,"I found this book to be full of a variety of contradictions. For example, in the section entitled ""The Big Dirty Secret"" the author tells a story about how a manufacturer hired her and another team to work out a manufacturing issue. While there is a point to be made about the skills necessary to find out the goal of the manufacturer, the point made by this author seemed to be more along the lines of ""being right"". At one point she states ""Doing things appropriately usually means thinking beyond the obvious and focusing on asking the right questions, instead of getting the right answer."" If this is true, why does the front of her book claim that it is ""...everything you need to know about running a garment industry business, when no one else can (or will) help you...""???"
2,Not without its faults,"Not without its faults. Some occaisionally repeated words and phrases cropped up, and times, some passages in general were a overly wordy."
5,Don't start a business or make patterns without this book!,I wish this book had been available when I started my business. I encountered so many of the problems described in the book and they could have been avoided.
5,You Must Buy This Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are a DE or are planning to be this is the best resource to have. It answered all the questions I had as well as ones I had'nt thought of. I recieved my book a couple of days ago and I've read it cover to cover totally devouring it! Kathleen is so generous in sharing her vast knowledge and inspires you while keeping a clear and rational perspective of the industry. After reading her book, I feel more confident and educated yet humble and level headed. You need to buy this book!!!!"
2,Disappointed in Amazon,"The caps look good but Amazon sent me a used item. The caps have double sided tape to hold them to the pickup and one of the caps they sent had the protecive tape removed, the caps were stuck together, and they were not in the protective plastic sleeve that the manufacturer originaly used (The sleeve was just jammed into the packing box). Obviously someone had returned the item and Amazon did not inspect it before reselling it to me.I did get the caps unstuck and the tape looks sticky enough to work but I expect better from Amazon."
3,Another average war movie,This movie is about to enemies that go to the same aerial gunner school. One as an instructor and the other as a student. They deal with their issues while trying to do the right thing for the war effort.
4,Better Than Average B Movie,"This turned out better than I thought.World War Two.Two enemies,Foxy Pattis(Chester Morrois)a small time hood and SGT Jon Davis(Richard Arlen)a exlawmen are in the same outfit of the US Air Force training to be gunners.Both fall for their pal Sandys(Jimmy Lydon)sister Peggy(Amelia Ward)Soon both see combat and the two must work together.Keep an eye out for Robert Mitchum and William Marshall(Bits)Not a bad War film."
3,They should remaster it !,The video was like in the 40s. They should remaster it !How could you sell movies like that ? You can't watch it !
2,Aerial Gunner,Typical of the war movies of that age. Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice. I enjoyed looking at an America that was. Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life.
4,The end of Pinhead?,This film was clever and entertaining. However it dose'nt relate to the original as the box was supposed to have been made in china where as in this it is a french puzzle box.Doug Bradley is ever good as Pinhead and the climax to BLOODLINE is excellent. I recommend this!
1,worst of the series,"A very ambitious premise that goes absolutely nowhere. Since the movie tries to deal with three different time periods in only 81 minutes, none of them gets fleshed out very well. The part set in the present could have been skipped entirely. The ""twin"" cenobites were extremely lame, especially when they kill a guy by squeezing him between themselves. The only worse cenobite was the girl from part III (she burns people with cigarrettes! Scary!) Good to see Pinhead finally get what's coming to him, though."
1,Hellraiser fans - avoid it.,"First of all I'd like to say that I am a huge fan of Pinhead and I love the Hellraiser mythos. But this film is really poor. The first three films of the series are probably one of the best splatter horror trilogies, and this sequel should never be made. The plot is silly, the actors (except Doug - Pinhead - Bradley) out of place, the make-up of the other cenobites (the twins, the female, the dog) ridiculous. All in all, this movie is to the Hellraiser series exactly what Batman & Robin (1997) is to the Batman series. A poor homage rather than a real sequel. I just hope that Hellraiser V : Inferno will have the dark magic of the first two films, or the excitement of the third. The single star I gave is for the music score which is pretty good (the Hellraiser films had always a good score). The fact that this film was 'directed' by the 'infamous' Mr. Alan Smithee says it all..."
5,Excellent movie,This movie is by far the second best in the series ( the first being the best of course.) it goes back and explains the mysterious history of lemarchand's puzzlebox and finally brings to an end the reign of the horrible cenobites on earth. a must see for any hellraiser fan.
3,"Pinhead in the Future,","Pinhead in the Future, hmmmm.... a little tacked on but it still has some chills, and an Interesting way to close the Story, Sooooo.... Pretty Cool."
4,ya gotta see!,if you like horror movies then this one is not to be missed. pinhead is in top form again. be warned though: the violence is pretty graphic.
4,They saved the best for last!!,"The saved the best Hellraiser movie for last!! I have been a fan of the series since it began, and I must say that this was the best of the bunch! It explains the origin of the evil cube that opens the gates of hell, and explores the depth of human evil at the same time. Some of the best characters yet come to life in the short stories that bind together this all too captivateing tale."
2,Poorly done,"The setting-sometime in the near future. The premise-a family man who is making a space repisintation of the box, only to find out that an ancestor of his made the original box that unleased the hell demons that we know so well. Give it a break, the future and evil demons have been done before. Give it a rest. A poorly thought and unoriginal movie about a man who is trying to close the gates to hell. This sound familiar? If it doesn't don't even consider watching this horrible movie."
1,0 STARS: This is pure nonsense.,"We got Jason in space and we get Pinhead in space. This is pure nonsense. Words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels: when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people, it's time to stop making these movies!!"
1,Alan Smithee,"People,This movie is by definition an embarrasment. You must know that The 'Smithee' moniker is applied when the movie is finished and the real director says ""This sucks out loud! Take my name off of it. NOW!!!!""So movie fans before you start with your Smithee for the Oscars campaign, know this fact.TLCPS: Did I mention that this was unwatchable? They even tried excessive nudity. Come On...."
2,OK,"This movie has became the usual horror sequal where the script is bad and the acting is bad, and everyone is wondering why this movie ever got script approval, this movie has been watered down to a usual horror movie, hardly what the first two films of this series were like."
3,A huge dissapointment!,"Pinhead in spave you say? No...not really. Only 20 minutes of the film is located in space. The rest is a prequel to the Hellraiser series, how the box was made, and how it recieved it's power. So I have to say, I miss Pinhead. John Merchant, whose Bloodline has stood in the way for Hell to be released, is the so called victim in the film. And now Pinhead and his friends are going for revenge. Right now, another sequel is awaiting...but judging by the rumours, it doesn't sound good. It will only include Pinhead for 5-10 minutes. Maybe it would a kinda of film like ""Hellraiser - Bloodline"". If so, it won't be able to compare with the first 3 installments. If you're a fan of the Hellraiser films, it's great to have this one as a collectionfiller, but if you aren't familiar with the series. Watch the first 3 instead!"
3,O.K but not a true Hellraiser film!,"In every way I tried to look at this film to give it a higher rating, but there is just something wrong. This movie doesn't have the feel or atmosphere of a Hellraiser film and it's pretty boring. Don't get me wrong, it does have it's highlights but they are rare. The end space sequence left with saying: "" What the.."" because it was to short and it moved along to fast. Is this a true way to end the Hellraiser series? They better come out with another one so this one is not the final. I would rent it or watch it on t.v."
3,A Relief After the 3rd Installment,"The first two Hellraisers were the best, but this one is better than the third. Don't get me wrong, I liked the third but it was like the 3rd Halloween movie. It had nothing to do with the two before it, or the ones after it. This fourth installment in the Hellraiser series explains the origin of the puzzle box as well as many other tidbits. I'm still waiting for a widescreen/uncut version. (I've seen the uncut version which reveals 4 extra minutes of pure gore and intensity) Keep your fingers crossed."
1,Avoid This DVD,According to the back of the DVD box this movie is supposed to be Widescreen.When i tried to watch this movie on my new HD LCD tv using my Xbox 360 this movie turns out to NOT be Widescreen like it says on the back of the DVD box.
1,A right load of horse's dollop,"This unbelievably cut/edited film is absolutely pathetic.I'm ashamed and embarassed to admit I wasted time and money watching it.A third sequel has always seemed pretty desperate to me,but to some drivel like the Hellraiser series(bar number one)?This film seems to rely on vulgar shock tactics to win audience attention.Never mind how chopped and changed it is,I think the real reason the real director,Kevin Yagher,slapped the humiliating Alan Smithee directorial credit on the film is because of how mind blowingly awful it is.I mean,look at that demon dog.What a mess.Whoever was responsible for the special effects ought to be shot.Pinhead's progression throughout the centurie's is told in an extremely uninvolving fashion.Aside from the Smithee billing,I also think the real reason this went straight to video is because of how poor it is.Please avoid."
1,by far the worst,"even the second one had its moments.but this is just ridiclous! far-fetched as ever, this movie has yet an even more confusing plot than the second and goes nowhere. the ending is lame and somewhat predictable. gives the previous chapters(yes even the second one !) and mr. barkers creativity a bad name."
1,I think Pinhead got his pins taken out in this film!,This film [is bad]!It's the same stuff over and over with the stupid cube and the chains..This film has so much sex and violence I got sick of it.It was very wierd being a Hellraiser fan but if you want a good Pinhead flick watch Hellraiser(the original)or HellBound:Hellraiser2.Hellraiser 3;Hell on Earth isn't that bad but far better than this film!
2,Oh Dear,"There is a reason most stories are written as trilogies; if you want to know why watch this, the 4th of the Hellraiser films. The plot's gone out of steam, they have to resort to rewriting some of the previous films (the box becomes French not Chinese) and inventing a new baddy (some strange imortal woman who lives on Earth not the Cenebite plane).Aside from that, the Pinhead makeup is as good as ever & it's an enjoyable romp. Watch it with an ample supply of a snack food of your choice & you'll be fine."
3,Not as bad as one would expect,"The director was so disappointed with the final version of the film, that he had his named removed and replaced with the notorious Alan Smithee. Considering that and that the film has enough going on in its plot for two Hellraiser sequels, the film didn't come out all that bad. It's story surrounds the origins of the puzzle box and how its creator's bloodline is cursed through the centuries. It hops form the 1800's, to modern times, and finally ends in the future on a space station. The acting ain't all that great, and more plot holes in Peter Atkins script, but fans will find something appealing about this film."
1,A real stinker,"This is an Alan Smithe film for good reason. The movie is pure and utter CRAP! Nothing in it is even remotly entertaining (with the exception of one minor story line). The only thing the movie had going for it was decent gore, which it succeds in, but otherwise a real clunker."
2,Hellraiser 4,"I am a big horror movie fan, I respect all kinds of films. But this one, was alright. The story line was good, the special effects were wonderful but the film needed a huge improvment. There is no features. It's worth seeing, but not buying. Also catch the new sequel that was just released ""Hellraiser 5: Inferno""."
1,Pinhead in Space,"Aboard a low orbit space station, a young man is trying to destroy the gateway to hell, including Pinhead and the rest of his evil sidekicks. As always, shocking plot, shocking acting, the pinhead make up is terrible, special effects are nothing fancy, and even the gore has lost it's touch. Even if you are a Clive Barker fan, this one is not worth grabbing."
2,To Set the Record Straight...,"I just want to be clear that director ""Alan Smithee"" is a pseudonym. For who? Who knows? It is used when a director is ASHAMED of the movie they did. For instance, David Lynch used ""Alan Smithee"" on the TV version of DUNE. If you see a director with this name STAY AWAY! I will only give BLOODLINE a 2, and that is only because it's part of the HELLRAISER series, and is worth watching with the volume down to get a good look at the nasty Cenobites. Buy this if you've got some extra spending money and everything else in the world that you already want. Otherwise, wait until your friend happens to rent it, and watch it in an altered state of consiousness."
4,Highly Underated,"It is the infamous ""Pinhead in Space"" but other than that part the film is interesting. The best scenes involve the 1700s and the creation of the box. There is an awesome demoness named Angelique who plays a pivotal role. She is from Hell (before the cenobites take over) and manipulates each generation of the toymaker's lineage. Later she is turned into a wicked cenobite along with twin security guards (maybe they hooked up with the twins from Inferno)."
2,Fair music,"I bought this because I had heard one of her songs and liked it very much. This album was with a different band, and I didn't like it much."
2,"I love the Cannon Jug Stompers, but this IS NOT COMPLETE","I wish Yazoo had called this something OTHER than ""Complete"". It's not. It's great, don't get me wrong, but this only half of the Cannon Jug Stomper's catalog, and Yazoo does fans a real disservice, being so misleading in their titling of this product."
4,Nice Item,This is perfect for adding Ipod music to your home stereo system. It was easy to hook up with the included instructions. It sounds great.
2,Exactly WHY do you need this??,"This retails at around $99. If you use a remote and you can't view the song tracks on the screen, so you would have to get up and walk across the room to look anyway!The VIDEO iPOD (80gb) supports direct RCA connections thru the headphone jack for VIDEO and AUDIO. You do need to use the Apple cable for $20. Generic 3 way RCA to 8mm cables don't insert deep enough into the iPOD to get the video connection. Using Handbrake on Mac, I can then take my DVD's with me on the road with the master copies safe and sound at home. It is like a TiVo in my pocket.Also, using the Onkyo, you give up your s-Video port. Most TV's only have one. Also, they could have simply used the component video lead (yellow RCA) direct to the AMP, and reduced the complicated wiring.Ah well."
4,Sailing with Uncle Walter,"I've long respected Walter Cronkite, loved history and geography, and been remarkably queasy about being out on a boat. Despite my fear of sailing, I truly enjoyed this book. Cronkite is, no surprise, a wonderful storyteller. As he meanders the upper and lower stretches of the Atlantic Seaboard, followed, more cursorily, by the Gulf and Pacific coasts, he tells stories about the history and geography of our coasts. In many ways, despite our vast interior stretches, America is an ocean country and Cronkite revels in sharing his insights and loves. Particularly poignant now, though unintentionally, are his discourses about Manhattan and the general New York City area. Although he but mentions the World Trade Center in passing, one can only imagine the changed skyline from a small boat and what Mr. Cronkite might say about that. All in all, a delightful tour of our magnificent coastline. And if you actualy enjoy sailing, this would have to be a perfect book!"
4,A nice read,"Walter Cronkite shows that he was a talented writer amid his many journalistic talents. The book is a leisurally read; I'm sure he wrote it as if his readers were aboard his boat with him. The book is filled with history, as well a interesting tidbits of his experiences of his journies to the areas he describes, as well, as self-depricating humor about minor saling mishaps and near mishaps. Mostly, though, it's his tribute to the beautiful coatlines of the US that he seems fortunate enough to have seen firsthand.The book arrived from the seller quickly, and in great condition, even better than described."
2,a rambling travel-history log of our coasts,"There is a reason that you can pick this book up for 1 penny, like new. It is a rambling travel log that mixes in history with walt's sailing cruises along the coast. If you were actually sailing the coast, it would be a fun book to have along so you could get some background on the places you were sailing past."
4,"I Guess What They Say Is True, I'll Read Anything","I never know what is going to catch my eye, and one afternoon at a bookstore, this did. Mr. Cronkite's voyages around the coastline of America, from New England to the Pacific Northwest, present parts of our nation in a whole new way. I loved reading about the towns and cities the Cronkite's visited, and I loved finding out about the natural features and the wildlife that called them all home. Cronkite has not lost the talent of looking at the world thru a reporter's eye, and his descriptions of lighthouses, shipwrecks, flora and fauna and the residents of scores of seaside locales drew me in. This unexpeced read turned out to be one of the books I most enjoyed a couple years ago when I got it. Lovers of the sea, fans of this legendary former network anchorman, or anyone who simply treasures a good book, will find their time spent here well-invested."
4,cannon weight retreiver,"The Cannon retreiver works well.....however you are on your own as to how to assemble them on your down rigger, where to place the cord clamp on your downrigger or how long the retreiver cord should be.....the instructions suck."
5,Cannon Weight Retriever,"Bought 2 for the new downriggers on the new boat, would not run riggers without them on the cables!1 of the 2 was defective from the factory (Very odd for Cannon products), but Amazon sent me out a replacement immediately. Great product and great service from Amazon!"
4,A WHIZ!,"Roy Smeck could play any type of stringed instrument and play it like a man posessed. This CD covers the years 1926-49. He was truly a guitar whiz, and you will be amazed by his dexterity! If you like this type of music, you will probably also enjoy the music of Sol Hoopi and ""King"" Benny Nawahi."
1,Stay away from this monitor,"Just after the warranty was up, the thing comes out of hibernation or sleep mode and enters the ""pong"" mode with a bouncing message advising it is set to the wrong resolution. Mine is not. Samsung offers no help, but will fix it for the cost of a new one. There are fixes involving soldering a resistor to the circuit board. Removing the power cord helps sometimes. At first, I thought it was my computer having standby/hibernate problems."
4,Excellent Movie,Entertaining and educational. Incredible story of artist from childhood to death. Well crafted camera work and production with lots of eye candy and enjoyable music. There were some noticeable pixel distortions a couple of times in the film but nothing too distracting.I do not care for communism and socialist parties but I still enjoyed this movie and watched it three times.
3,Beautiful movie - but a Hollywood spin on the real Frida,"This is a beautifully acted, colorful, exuberant movie. But anyone who wants to learn about the gruff and disturbing real life of Frida, needs to seek out the truth elsewhere. This was just too pretty in every sense."
1,"""incorrect disk""?","Two-disk set, purchased ""new,"" region 1. One disk--the film itself--would not play; was ""incorrect disk"" per region 1 player. The special features disk in this set did NOT have this problem, which seems to rule out DVD player issue."
3,feedback,"aged; needs recast updated; I liked the story a great deal; good insights into her art, marriage & escapades. Her husband an usual and great artist who eventually discovered love of Frida."
5,"Lush drama of Frida Kahlo, muralist Diego Rivera¿s wife","The tempestuous story of the life of Frida Kahlo, Mexican flamboyant and surrealist painter, and Diego Rivera, her brilliant womanizing husband. Salma Hayek is perfectly cast in this sumptuous film that chronicles her own revolutionary behavior, not just politically but also sexually, especially given the era in which she lived. Beautiful cinematography renders a crippling trolley accident vividly real on the screen, while turning a trip to NY into a cartoon-ish sequence.Wonderful."
3,is her art as forgettable as this movie?,"she painted alot of pictures, and she married a famous artist, and she had a mustache, and theres alot of nice music. the film is vastly less important than it thinks it is; i dont know enough about its subject to determine if thats fair ..."
4,"Maybe Not for Kahlo Purists, But...Great Movie","Great direction by Taymor; across the board believable acting, and brilliant visual effects of weaving the paintings of Frida Kahlo into the story line. I understand some of the Kahlo purists' complaints, but for those with a moderate knowledge of her work this will be a very satisfying movie. It's primarily the love story of Rivera and Kahlo and the story of Kahlo's artistic evolution. Of course her life encompassed much more, but how much can you say in one movie? It's vibrant, fun, exciting, emotional, sad, and it made me want to learn more about Kahlo, Mexican art and history. Hey -- that's pretty good for a movie!"
3,Whitewash,"Frida is a cinematic whitewash of the real Frida Kahlo who was both physically beautiful and spiritually ugly. She was regarded by many of her fellow artists as being a ""despicable cur."" This movie presents a sanitized version of Kahlo's life and left out much of what was an oftentimes ugly personal life.Frida Kahlo was a great artist and a horrible person. This movie fails to present the latter part of her personality and it suffers because of that deficiency."
2,As a Mexican I'm mad,"This is an awful movie of the life of one of the best painters of Mexico. This is because Salma is playing Salma not Frida. If you really want to see a really good movie about this painter watch ""Frida, Naturaleza viva"" with Ofelia Medina it's in spanish but you can find it with english subtitles."
1,SAD PORTRAYAL,"IT IS VERY SAD TO SEE A MOVIE THAT DOES NOT BEGIN TO SHOW FRIDA KAHLO'S REAL INTENSITY. IT IS ALSO RIDICULOUS HOW A CREW AND CAST OF ACTOR WHO ARE MOST OF THEM SPANISH SPEAKING, MADE AN ENGLISH MOVIE WITH SPANISH ACCENT. IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. THIS MOVIE IS JUST A SHOWCASE FOR SALMA HAYEK AND HOW SHE LOOKS IN A COLORFUL BACKGROUND."
4,Credible story of an incredible woman,"Bringing art to life is always tricky, but this film frames the artist Frida Kahlo perfectly.Selma Hayek is superb, her heart and sole in every scene and blending with Alfred Molina's portrayal of Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist. Seen through the eyes of others, Rivera's personality comes through but never distracts, only adds to the story of his wife, Frida.I had a few questions at the end, but rather than being frustrated, I wanted to see the film again...Always a good sign."
2,How is a Movie about a Spanish artist not in Spanish Audio?,"I bought this movie for my mami who was looking forward to it coming out in DVD so she could hear it in Spanish. How did she come to this assumption? My fault! I naturally assumed that a movie about Frida, Mexican artist who spoke Spanish, made by Salma Hayek, again a Mexican artist who speaks Spanish, would have Spanish audio.I was very very disappointed and my mami was so upset she didn't even want to watch it. Therefore I was forced to return it, find another present and not have the dvd there to remind my mami of her disappointment.I'm so upset that I would like to find out how to let that person who made the decision to have FRENCH audio instead of Spanish have a piece of my mami's and my mind."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"This is such a GREAT MOVIE! Do not pay attention to Mexican reviewers with bad intentions, It is incredible how envious is the Mexican people; they can't bear the fact that an actress from their own country succeeded in a great project of her own... shame on you Mexico. The movie is just incredible, the visual concept, the costumes, the performances, the music, the whole movie is full with passion! I highly recommend it. I'm not fond of Frida's paintings, but this is a movie, a great one, and I was so amazed when I first saw it. It's the product of so much hard work from Salma and her team. I specially enjoyed the part of the little skeleton doctors, animated by stop-motion at the hospital scene. Those are typical handcrafts in Mexico, and it was a very interesting detail on the movie. By the way, I'm Mexican."
5,FRIDA,"I love this movie, FRIDA. It speaks to my artistic side.I am moved to do more art and put my feelings on cloth."
4,Beautiful Movie!,"This was a beautiful movie, I like it, the story is interesting maybe a bit long. The acting performance is very good and especially Selma Hayek. I love the atmophere of this movie, the colors, it's a wonderful movie if you are a fan of Hayek or Frida you will love this movie."
4,soild film with style,"The performance is convincing and pace of the film is good. I particulaly liked the animated sequence done by the Quay Brothers, it was a nice surprise."
5,"In the end, hopeful","I watched this film with two women who lived through the times portrayed. As they expressed their gratitude for youthful memories authentically brought once again to life, I tried to imagine a time when the Russian and Mexican revolutions were just being betrayed; when young people, like the two mentioned, nevertheless came from around the globe to risk their lives for their vision; and endured personal and political betrayal. Yet, I'm reminded that period pieces are often more about the present than the past. May people listen to Kahlo's words to Trotsky: in life and love, we can endure more pain than we think."
4,gypsy dancer,"Having just read the book, The Lecuna, by Barbara Kingsolver I wanted a quick reference to the life of Frida Kalho. I certainly received a wonderful picture of her, through the fully energetic portrayal by Selma Hayek. Frida's talent, her independent mind, her life time struggle with pain and her personal determination to express herself are all excellently portrayed.Frida's paintings were recreated as ""freeze frames"" which came to life at various pivotal points though out the movie giving a powerful melding of her art and her circumstance. The accurate historic Mexican folkloric costuming was stunning. Even the Casa Le Azul --her Blue House-- was accurately recreated.The director has done a wonderfully artistic job while accurately depicting the times and the struggles Frida and Diego endured. Listening to the interviews on DVD#2 were also fascinating.I'll enjoy this movie again and again."
3,Okay...needs more recipes,I was a bit disappointed by this book. There wasn't a great variety of recipes and most were geared to outdoor cooking. I'll be looking for another cookbook.
4,Largely for camping,"I'm on a quest to find a decent cookbook with more modern recipes that are cooked stove top or in the oven. This book had a decent variety of typical camping recipes, soups/stews, beans, roasts, that you can cook on your campfire using charcoal briquets. I go camping once a year maybe, so it's not quite what I need."
1,Fragmented,"Like his first novel in this series, the book is written with a series of fragments instead of complete sentences.Also, he can't even get the spelling of Conan's clan correct. He continually calls Conan's clan ""Conarch"" but John Maddox Roberts established it as ""Conach."""
5,EGGSEPTIONAL EGG CUPS,Great egg cups beautiful marble and very unusual. Will fit large eggs for best results..Will use frequently. Color very pretty dark green.
4,On Itunes it is only 9 dollars!,"first off, don't pay 100 dollars for it from amazon's used section; it's cheap on itunes.Okay, the soundtrack.this is one of the first soundtracks I remembering recognizing as a kid as real music. It brings back the movie in full force in your memory. Classic American composing."
2,A lesson in how NOT to write a book.,"""Killing Our Own""... the title really says it all: those who wrote this book are completely biased and irrational. This book is one third poor scientific understanding, one-third good journalistic skills (and a whole lot of words), and one-third anti-nuclear propaganda. The result is laughable, and should be avoided by anyone looking to further their understanding of nuclear energy.Wasserman and Alvarez have no formal nuclear training. It is clear after reading this book that they have very limited understanding of they subject matter. One thing is certain though: they really hate nuclear energy. And that's a shame too, since it is the only energy source that can rid us of our dependence on foreign oil, provide emission-free electricity, and produce the mass quantities of hydrogen that will fuel our future economy.This book is good if you're looking for examples of anti-nuclear propaganda, and is the only reason I gave it two stars."
3,15 fun and easy games for young readers,I teach preschool so some of the games are too hard for them but this would be great for Kindergarten and 1st graders that need an easy way for them to review letters and other concepts on their own at a learning center
2,IT'S DEDUCTABLE,"NOTHING TO INDICATE DEDUCTIONS THAT YOU MAY BE OVERLOOKING. NOTHING INDICATING THAT THE PROGRAM CAN ONLY BE USED TO TRACK DEDUCTIONS DURING 2004, AND CANNOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING IN ANY OTHER YEAR. REALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
3,Not made in the USA,"I guess I should have paid closer attention, and should have known at the price offered this tool was made in China. But I bit on the marketing and ended up with a tool that works okay. I was disappointed though, and will read the fine print closer in the future. The tool just feels cheap."
4,Pro Quality Torque Wrench,"Good Torque wrench for your buck, shipping was prompt and packaged very well, and comes with convenient carry case.I used it a few times and seems durable; only issue i have noticed is when you set your inch lbs. on the adjustment knob, it doesn't lock in place, it is held there snug, but no locking mechanism to hold it in case your wrist turns it a little while tightening. For the price it is a very good product, i would reccomend this tool to anyone interested in a good Torque Wrench for a great price."
1,Pieces,"The product, a torque wrench, arrived in pieces, not in one piece as desired. It was not a produce meant to be assembled by the user. I was supposed to come put together. I wrote a letter of complaint and still haven't received a reply. What am I suppose to do with it? How does it go together? Are all the pieces there? Where are the instructions? I've done business with you folks before and I've always been content, but I don't think I'll order anything from you again because you don't back up your products. I'm very, very, very unhappy and now I have a expensive paper weight! Not good! Not good at all!"
2,Uh Oh,looks like they took a junky torque wrench and put Neiko on it. Their older wrenches were good but this is like the wrenches you get for 10$ at harbor freight stores.
3,Z3,Great for light duty items. Somewhat difficult to get confident settings. I ratcheted through the settings prior to using it to get a better feel for operation. Very good price.
3,Decent wrench,"I used these to upgrade from the old needle style torque wrench. I have both the 3/8 and 1/4 size. i use the 1/4 the majority of the time for auto, bicycles and motorcycles. They are not extremely accurate but are close enough for basic maintenance. Not sure if I would truct it for and engine rebuild but great for everything else."
1,Junk,"Cheaply made, the ""click"" action is vague and sloppy, and now it appears to be completely shot, and I only used it once. I would never trust this on any critical fasteners... could do a better job judging by hand.Should have put the 20 bucks towards a better quality item. My mistake."
1,Useless,"As received, the torque wrench was so badly out of calibration that it was totally useless. The torque settings on the wrench produced torques almost twice as high as the indicated values over the entire torque range. In addition, reproducibility was so poor that I was even unable to make a 'correction' table. Fortunately I discovered the problem before using the wrench or I would have surely stripped out the fasteners. The wrench appears to be a knock-off of the high quality 'Snap-On' wrench which is available on-line for ~$135. Don't waste your money on this product - buy the 'Snap-On' tool."
1,don't buy it,mine worked great when new but when I went to use it a year later the torque setting had frozen and I broke a $75 pair of rings over torquing them. you get what you pay for............
1,Don't waste your money,"I just received mine, and it doesn't have ANY markings for inch pounds. It's marked in Newton Meters on one side and Kilogram meters on the other. I guess I could do the conversions, but I'm not incliuned to. It's going back. And the enclosed literature is for a 10-150 Ft-Lb wrench."
4,Great value for the weekend mechanic.,"Works well. Reading the settings requires my reading glasses, but overall, I am very satisfied."
1,Didn't work,"These are small, thin and generally low quality. Most of the cost was shipping, so the company gets to keep my money, even though they sent me a shoddy product. I would not recommend."
5,good product,"I ordered this as a replacement cover for my directors chair. There are different types of chairs using round rods or flat slat rods. The seller should make it clearer that these covers are for chairs accommodating round rod. Given that, I found the product to be perfect and would buy again from this seller. The prices and shipping are lower now than indicated in past reviews."
5,Looks great and comfortable too!,Ordered this chairback to replace a worn out set. It is a beautiful color and fits well. It also appears to have some sort of water resistant finish as it got wet in an unexpected shower and still looks great.
3,Not the usual size,"The color was great as was the quality of the canvas. Unfortunately, the width of the seat was a minimum of two inches narrow. Seller was very good about accepting returns so on the hunt again."
3,Mixed review,"Although the blue canvas seat and back set for a folding director's chair was spot on accurate for color, the back is too loose and the seat is too tight."
5,Perfect for casual office chairs.,Perfect fit for the director chairs we had and the black ones go great for our casual office. Great price. Fast shipping.
1,Me too! They double charged me for shipping,The product itself was just fine. The sticks are round and the cover fit my 30 year old directors chair perfectly. Yet the shipping charges turned out to be DOUBLE what my Amazon confirmation showed. Days have gone by and I haven't heard back on my request for a refund of the shipping charges. This is just very poor customer service.
2,Width is too narrow!,"Rec'd two black chair covers today. It's standard durable canvas, but too narrow, like others have said. They don't fit our chairs from Pier 1. Tried to call the company but they're closed in the evening. Will try to return.They arrived in a heavier cardboard box with a catalog, like someone else said; instead of a lightweight shipping envelope. Who are these people? I won't ever order again from Homedecorators.com!"
5,YES!,"Have been looking high and low for this item. When I found this I bought 2 additional colors. I plan on ordering more! This is such an easy way to change the color and focus of a room. I use in my own home and as staging items for rentals. With a quick change of colors you can really make a statement in a room. Arrived on time, fit is perfect, quality was better than I expected, colors are vibrant!Definitely would recommend and will buy again!"
3,Director's Chair Replacement Covers,"I think the quality and color of these canvas replacement covers is excellent. However the shipping costs were outrageously high. I paid more to ship the items than the actual cost of the product. Though I really like these canvas replacement covers, I would not buy them again given the cost of shipping."
2,Great item but wrong size,"I thought the price for this set was great! However, it did not fit my chair. It was about 2 inches too small in width. I decided to keep it anyways since I would have lost money on shipping it back. I have put it on another directors chair I have and it doesn't fit it quite right either."
2,Wrong color,"The covers arrived promptly, except I had orderd ""wine"" and received red. I'm using them, only because it would be so much effort to ship the incorrect ones back and re-order. I'm using them, but unhappily so."
2,I was mislead by the advertisement of this item,I found the ad to be confusing and thought I was buying a chair and not just the replacement back and seat. I think the ad needs to be more clear that this is a replacement set for a certain model folding chair. Not happy with product and had to return it.
4,Completes bed in bag perfectly!,Received Hadley 18x18 square pillow. The pillow is a must to complete the look for the Dan River Hadley bed in a bag!
4,Jack Benny is just great in this forgotten classic.,"Jack Benny and a host of others will keep you in suspense as they foil the Nazis in this funny and yet tense movie. Set in Poland with Jack Benny as the leading actor in the troupe, this is Benny's best performance in a motion picture."
3,Mel Brooks did it better,"This story wasn't very funny when it was released, and Jack Benny was not ever very successful in films; Adolph Hitler was screaming threats and not amusing ones. Half a century later, with Hitler long dead and the Nazis a nightmare we're trying to forget, the Mel Brooks remake is much funnier."
5,A must. Plan and simple.,"You know very little about Jack Benny? Don't matter. This film has no right to be this funny. No film that deals with Nazis and death has any reason to be this hilarious. And yet, Benny and director Ernst Lubitsch found the perfect balance between wittiness and suspense. The scene near the end where Benny is put in a room with the body of the man he is impersonating? Genius. I actually had been laughing ten seconds early and then my chest tightened up. Great film with classic lines, terrific acting and genuine charm."
5,a true comedy classic,A movie about Hitler invading Poland shouldn't be this funny but Jack Benny and Carol Lombard make this both a comedy classic as well as showing what war was like in Europe. The Mel Brooks remake retains most of the original but expands a bit here and there. Both should be in your film library.
4,"""To be or not to be""","Obviously the title is from ""Hamlet"" It refers to a Polish theater company in Warsaw just prior to and during the 1939 German invasion. Benny plays an insecure ham actor married to Lombard. She appears to be entertaining herself with Robert Stack, a dashing Air Force officer. When the germans invade, the company has to masquerade as Nazis in order to foil a spy plot. Benny is typically himself and is well supported by the rest of the cast. Lombard is beautiful and funny. I have seen this movie many times, and wanted to have it in my collection."
5,a true underrated classic.......,"I am a great fan of one of the rightful kings of comedy, the late, great Jack Benny. He is featured at his wry best, here, along with the stunningly beautiful Carole Lombard--the last film she made before she tragically died in a plane crash. The title is based on the famous ""To Be, Or Not To Be"" soliloquy in William Shakespeare's HAMLET. A troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw must get by on their ability as thespians to elaborately (and effectively) disguise themselves, as well as adapt new identities, in order to fool the occupying troops. Jack Benny is hilarious and Carole Lombard is gorgeous and charismatic. Don't miss out on this."
5,Finding the right PDA,"The ipAQ H3955 is an excellent tool for managing multiple tasks. The color is sharp and the use of the equipment is easy. The negative side of this product also applies to other PDAs, battery life and loss of data if you allow the battery to die. The fact that I can use word, excel, and other programs easily on this PDA makes it easier for me. The expansion slot and memory cards are plentiful. A drawback is getting a manual with the PDA that explains its programs and how to use it. The manual that comes with the PDA is totally useless. They could have saved the time wasted putting it together and placing it in the box. I am still looking for a manual that can help shed light on some of the capabilities."
1,Attractive but abysmally frustrating,"Got this refurbished from Costco. Good screen etc. BUT, the power runs out every time you turn your back on it and there IS NO BACKUP (watch-type) battery. When the power runs out, you LOSE every program you ever installed, and the software walks you through an insultingly stupid nano-tutorial before you can use it again. Stupid design of the decade. Bought a stowaway keyboard for it and whenever the keyboard got near it, the Ipaq got flaky. Tonight the thing died again and I destroyed it (dead, it makes a better work of art than it ever did a PDA). Reason: I had to spend more time and effort reviving it than using it. A great concept with severely crappy reliability."
1,What a piece of icrap,"I have never been so disapointed after using my IPAQ. Do not purchase one of these icraps. They are a porqueria. The OS crashes on a daily basis. Please purchase a handheld that is running the Palm OS. My son is still running my old palm 3x (5 years strong). Out of 30 days out of a month, the icrap would work properly for 25 days. Do not buy one. I am the only person that has had these issues. I work in the IT industry and I have run into many people with the same issues. Buy a real PDA not a self tortured system. If you want to hone in on your troubleshooting skills without resolution, then this is the product for you. May the force be with you..."
1,Stay away from Ipaq's and Jornada's,"Having given Jornada and Ipaq one try each, it is my duty to warn you to stay from them. Both are good for one thing for one year: playing solitaire!! At the end of one year, they conk out like they were on a timing device of some sort."
2,Power issues,"I have had my 3955 for only 16 months of relatively light usage (I do not even use it every day, as I quickly learned how rapidly the unit burns through a charge). Now, for no apparent reason, the internal battery will not hold a charge . . . fully charged off the docking station, the unit is fully discharged (and all my data and settings gone!) less than 24 hours later after the unit has not been used at all! For this kind of money, I would expect better battery life and the ability to self-install a new battery, rather than having to send the unit in for service. I will probably not purchase another iPaq unless these issues are addressed by HP."
5,Fun little Film,"This is a fun little film from the 1960s. Now personally I wouldn't do a human sacrifice on ""the man"" instead I'd turn him into a big bunny, but then this would be Danny Darko and not Simon King of Witches."
5,"Very good quality, nice bag for little things","Same as the reviewer above, I bought this for my Canon SX100 camera. It is too big for the camera, indeed. But over the time I came to appreciate the space - my glasses and some Kleenex fit perfectly, I can store extra batteries, the USB cable or even the charger of the camera.Of course I still wish sometimes I'd find a more suitable bag, but this doesn't make the Lowepro bag a lesser bag.It's resistant (I have had it for more than year now), it's waterproof and pretty light when it's empty. I actually wish I could find a bigger bag with these qualities. And the price is very good, so I highly recommend it."
4,Nice collection,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD when I ordered it as there are no audio clips available. Truth be told, as a newbie pagan the title ""Witches Brew"" amused me enough to take a chance on it. Turns out I needn't have worried as the CD is well done. Each track is enjoyable and often stirring. Don't miss the humor of ""Summerland"" or the simplicity of ""And When I Rise"" for reflection."
4,Great CD,"There are 2 tracks that dont belong. Most of the music is awesome and I find myself singing it through the day, but Summerland is just bad, I suggest you rip it and erase that song from the playlist."
5,Mircea Sandulescu's Review,"""THE LIFE MANAGER AND OTHER STORIES"" (iUniverse, 2004) is wellnigh a perfect first volume of prose in English by an expatriate writer from Romania.Sterling characterizations...perfect pacing, vivid descriptions make for a flawless launching of a new writer in America.Roznoveanu has un uncanny knack for making things both simple and complex. She is a fine connoisseur of the feminine soul, despairs and stratagems to win love or to keep it. Oftentimes her poems describe love gingerly knocking on the door when there isn't anybody inside anymore.""Mircea SandulescuWriter"
4,"Hail, Victoria!","This movie stars one of my favorite actors, Anton Walbrook, who plays a smart, sensitive and determined Prince Albert to Anna Neagle's bossy, little Victoria. The movie is a homage to Victoria. It was made in 1937, probably to cheer up the Brits in a darker decade and remind them of their empire and how it developed under Victoria. The production values are good and the filming took place in the actual palace settings. This is an interesting movie, especially if you're an Anglophile."
5,An Amazing Book,"Raptor is on my list of favorite books, and although it may not be everyone, everyone deserves a bit of a jolt every now and again. The story of Thorn, although difficult to imagine is extremely interesting to follow and although the reader sometimes wonders if this is plain fiction or fantasy, the reader might not care. Of the three Gary Jennings books I've finished (Aztec, and Aztec Autumn were the other two, I never got far into Journeyer) Raptor is by far the best. It may have been the history of the Goths and the decadence of Rome or the far-from-infrequent sex scenes, but regardless of why, Raptor is an astounding book."
4,"Excellent historical information, flawed concept","As a fan of Jennings, I looked forward to Raptor with great anticipation. As in Aztec and Journeyer the historical information and the insight into an historical period was terrific. However, the hermaphroditic nature of the protagonist was unnecessary and the coincidental appearance of two intelligent, powerful hermaphrodites was unbelievable. Worth reading, but could have been better with a more believable protagonist."
2,"Pornography and extreme violence under the guise of a ""Historical Novel""","I, for one, am not at all surprised that this trash is out of print. I am not a squeamish person, but enough is enough. This author seems to relish in detailed descriptions of sexual encounters and perversions as well as nauseating brutalities. Using unusual expressions ""escutcheon"", etc. for various body parts makes it seem as if the writer browsed through a Thesaurus - high-brow porno is still porno. Got as far as mothers raping their sons (mentioned by another reviewer) and called it quits. Don't waste your money and a warning - if you have to read it don't attempt on a full stomach. A ""2"" for some of the historical reseach which is correct - most of it is only the filthy imagination of this (late) writer."
3,mixed thoughts about it...,"I really like books by Gary Jennings, but this one is not as good as all the others (e.g. Aztec). The writing is good, the idea of Thorn being a hermaphrodite is also interesting, but the charcters are not really explicitly defined. What I really thought to be sad is that some historic facts are just wrong: by 400something there were no convents yet, the first convent was foundet in the late 6th century. Also comparing the western roman empire with the eastern roman empire is wrong: while the west was already in its decline the eastern roman empire was still at its hight. However, being German myself, I liked the idea to write a (historic) novel about this period. Overall it is not a bad book, just not comparable to all his other writings."
4,the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars,"is because it is a tad overlong; jennings could've cut a few dozen pages and it would've flowed better. but i don't care! this is still a great and one of my favorite books. i'm finicky with my 5 star ratings and reserve them for only perfect books, which are few and far between.still, you WILL love this book. it's got so much. religion, pagans, sex, blood, politics, history... what is not to like? i recently lost my library due to a tragedy, and on my list of ""books to replace"" this one is at the top. do NOT miss out on this. it's actually pretty accurate, historically, too. if you want to learn about the end of the old empire and the start of the new christian realms, this is a wonderful, and not boring like a stuffy academic history book, experience to learn about that. it's fascinating to recall that the catholic church, embroiled in so much corruption and scandal today, hasn't really changed all that much in ~1500 years."
4,This book has good and bad points...,"To an experienced, and or practicing herbalist this book has a lot of good information as to dosages and other items. I would recommend this book to anymoderate to advanced student of herbology. If you are a beginner, or justcurious, then there are farbetter books out there for that purpose. This book is not a primer, or an introduction. As a side note, I must state that thebook ""Back to Eden"" by Jethro Kloss is a source ofa lot of the material in Santillo's book. Mr.Santillo amplifies a lot ofthe material from Back to Eden and catalogs itbetter, so if you have or plan to get Back to Eden, then this book should be a definite companion to it. And vice versa, Back to Eden fills in alot of the items Mr. Santillo insufficiently covers. I say if you're gonna buy one, get the other. Together, they make a wonderful, reliable foundation of knowledge to draw from regarding herbology and natural living."
4,An Excellent Primary Reference,"I bought my first copy of this book twenty one years ago during my first herbal medicine workshop. It was subsequently highlighted, underlined, dogeared and read countless times and of the many books on herbs I used over a period of years, it remained my favorite. I haven't seen this new edition but, based on the merits of the previous edition, I heartily endorse this as an herb book that helps a person readily learn and understand the actions and indications for a broad range of herbs as well as the specifics of their applications for different types of ailments.The only complaint I had about this book was that the nutrition & diet information in the older edition was not in line with ""traditional diets"" as we find them in preserved cultures (fermented foods, animal fats, etc.) but is more in keeping with the new-fangled ideas that arose during the 1910s and 20s, which have since been proven to be fads."
1,BAD,Spent most of the time watching boring interviews. Not enough film about Richthofen or pictures. A lot of factual errors. The funeral clip is not even that of von Richthofen!
1,"Nothing new, many erroneous facts","I was dissapointed with this video. Many things said in it are known to be wrong. For example, they credit Roy Brown as the one who shot down Richtofen. It is well known that the trajectory of the bullet that killed him came from the ground, probably from an Australian gunner (as is well explained and documented in an excellent Nova documentary).Also, this video repeats many films that have been shown over and over (obviously, there is no new footage of Richtofen). Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting here. There is a long interview of the very polite German Commander of the current Richtofen Squadron, where he gives many facts about his squadron, it's history and origins plus Richtofen information, but unfortunately there is nothing really interesting or new there.Look somewhere else for an interesting documentary on the Red Baron."
5,Cinderella with a twist,"This movie is the best, though I think you have to be a girl to truly appreciate the movie. It is a very modern movie in the subtle context of woman's right and as always the movie ends happily ever after."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!,This was a great movie and I can't wait to see it on video. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I suggest you see it sometime. You don't know what your missing
4,"ultimate date movie, it is so romantic.",i advise everyone to see this. drew goes to all ends of the earth to be with her prince charming. just like i do for mine.
5,This movie rocks!!!!:-),"Incredible! Drew Barrymore at her best! Angelica Houston is perfectly evil. Dougray Scott is wonderful as the not-so-perfect prince.Leonardo Da Vinci is a nice touch.A great family film,10 stars!!!"
5,I Really Like This Movie!,"I really like this movie! When I first saw it, that was when I started to like Drew Barrymore. I like her character a lot. I'm 8 years old and I think that if you haven't seen it, you should see it soon."
5,If you LOOVVEE romantic comedy this is your movie!!!,"I love romantic comedies, they're the greatest. This is a really good one to get and I personally don't know anyone who doesn't like it . It's up there with While You Were Sleeping and Never Been Kissed. Drew Barrymore is really good in this movie too, showing what really might have happened and not all that Fairy Godmother Stuff."
3,Ever After; a very good movie,What can I say? This movie is the perfect romance movie with humor in it. Drew Barrymore gives an outstanding performance as Danielle. Anjelica Huston gives another fabled performance as the Countess. Dougray Scott gives a humorous performance as the Prince of France. Director Andy tennant should be proud of this movie. Rated PG-13 for brief language and mild violence.
5,If you love Cinderella ...,If you loved Cinderella as a girl you will love this. It puts a little twist on the story. Or should I saw sets the story straight. The casting in this movie was great the people seemed to really match the character. It was well written and earned its 5 stars. This movie is one you will watch over and over again.
5,Ever After,"I have liked this movie since it came out! My 7 year old was interested in a period piece and this movie is a good fit. It has Da Vinci, and although fiction, explores slavery, status, etc. It contains no inappropriate language or sex. He really enjoyed it! Great family movie! Recommend!"
3,Ever After,"Yet again another Cinderella story, buthas some zest to it because it was a littledifferent. A tomboy Cinderella who is notafraid to speak her mind-even to a prince.Anjelica Huston keeps the beat moving as theannoying and sly step-mother. I enjoyed it."
3,It Swept Me Off My Feet,"It is rare that i like new release movies, but i fell in love with ""Ever After"" the first time i watched it. The movie is not historically correct, with small unrealistic facts like the british accent in France. It is predictable but who does not know the story of Cinderella? The comstuming is astonishing and i love the fact that Cinderella is strong and independent. I do not give it five stars because i think the little details is what gives a film charcater and i disagreed with some details. It is a comedy/romance/adventure movie that will touch different age groups in many different ways."
4,One of my favorite versions of Cinderella!!,"I remember being 10 when I saw the trailer for this movie. I'm 23 and I love this movie more now than I did then. The characters are superbly cast, the acting is excellent from all the actors, the story is unique even as it tells a timeless story and presents complex themes. The story is pretty similar to the basic Cinderella story we all know, except towards the end. There is no fairy godmother save a scene with Leonardo Da Vinci but it didn't matter. Angelica Huston truly was the evil stepmother, her jealousy towards Danielle was evident in the look on her face as her new husband dies says his last words to Danielle. Drew Barrymore wins everyone's heart as Danielle who remains good hearted even as everything is taken from her. Danielle is vulnerable, yet strong and rescues herself--so refreshing to see!! One of the best movies of the 90s and very highly recommended!! Only thing is the DVD doesn't have any special features besides the trailer."
4,Great family movie,"I just discovery this movie and came to tell the world about this wonderful movie that my whole family jut enjoyed. To my surprise this would the 764th review of this movie, so i guess a few people have discovered it already.Beautifully photographed and acted, the script takes a old story and presents it in a manner that lets the story live anew.The 4 stars is because I save my 5 star grades for something extra, extra special, unique and brilliant such as The Lion King and the Princess Bride."
3,I loved the moovie,I loved the moovie. The bad thing was that it wasn't in the promised shape so I felt dissapointed when I received it :(
5,"An incredibly funny, amazingly touching tale of a brave girl","I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and Drew just shines in the role. Touching, funny but not fairy tale foolish. It's just incredible!"
4,"A very nice, enjoyable movie for the incurable romantic!","I saw this movie when it first came out and it stayed with me until it came out on video tape where, naturally, I had to go buy it. It was good on the big screen and it is just as good the second time around on the smaller screen. I thought that Drew Barrymore (who I feel like I grew up with) put in an excellent performance in the movie. I really recommend this to any die-hard romantic movie watcher (like me)! Enjoy. Why 4 stars instead of 5? I thought there could've been a little better interaction between the prince and Drew. The scene with the gypsies kinda put me off, but that's all."
5,Wonderful love story that will tear at your heart strings!,"I am a huge Drew fan and SHE, only she, could have played the PERFECT Cinderella. No one else could have stolen your heart the way she does. Her eyes draw you into her purity in this film. Dougray is a newcomer that we will see MUCH more of, I hope. They have such chemistry together and the acting/story line/costumes/romance ares PERFECTION! I cannot say enough about this movie except to say, if you are into Pure and Solid romances, this one is for you!!!!!!"
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!,"wonderful movie. Ms.Barrymore is a very tallented actress and has improved over the last decade. The movie was great, and I don't see why it was rated PG-13. If you only buy one movie this year, make it Ever After. It was truly wonderful. I hope there is another one like it soon"
5,The Best Version of Cinderella w/ some good butt kicking,"Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella as never seen before. With a quick wit,brains,looks, and the willingness to kick alittle ""step-sisterly bootie"" , she wins over the heart of a handsome prince, played by Dougrey Scott. The story alters more with the help of a step-sister who in the end makes you love her as much as Cinderella. Also, you have a wonderful cast who brings this to life, altering a ""fairy-godmother"" to a ""fairy-godfather"" with the help of famous artist Leonardo. You will laugh and cheer as you let yourself be pulled into this wonderful story of love, comedy, and ""just rewards""."
5,Soon to be classic,One of the best ver of cinderella imo.Got here on time well package.If u have not seen this movie u should.
5,Ever After,I found this to be an excellent telling of the Cinderella story. I like everything that I have seen Drew Barrymore in.
5,This movie was so.... different!!,"Every other movie usually has a bad ending, or something bad happens!! i love the way that this is a very innocent movie!! go watch it!"
5,Intriguing retelling of a classic.,"My daughter (10) convinced me to buy this movie sight unseen, and I am glad that I did. It was thoroughly entertaining. I liked the way the story was treated like it really could and did happen. Drew Barrymore was enchanting which totally suprised me. Under fives who want to watch dancing mice should stick to Disney, but everyone else would enjoy this version as well."
3,An Okay Cinderella Story,"An okay film, but not one I watch over and over again. But I'm more of a sci - fi action watcher, even though every girl like a little romance once and awhile. If you enjoy long ago fairy tale love storie you'll probably enjoy this movie."
5,AN AWSOME MOVIE!!!!,"I went to the cinima and watched it. It was a great movie!!! I really loved it. I've now seen it at least 7 or 8 times already. And I have bought the movie. That's how much I loved it. It's a romantic, drama, action movie. I highly recomend it to other viewers. I love Drew Barrymore. I've seen just about all of her films. They are also great movies that should be checked out too. I think everyone should see Ever After. I think you would really like it."
5,Wonderful!,"Drew Barrymore does an excellent job portraying ""Cinderella"" as a strong, determined woman who doesn't NEED a fairy godmother, (just a little help from da Vinci!) Angelica Huston is magnificient as the stepmother, extremely realistic and just a great job by all involved with the project."
5,A great mother - daughter movie!!!,"I went to this movie with my neighbor, liked it so much 3 days later I took my 9 year old daughter to it. We will never think of Cinderella in the same way again, the movie made the story believable!! We were thoroughly entertained, and can't wait to buy it, and I don't buy very many videos!!"
1,Have Yet To Receive My Purchase,I purchased this item over a month ago and have yet to receive it. I have sent three e-mails to the seller and have not received a reply. Many others have had this problem with him. I would stay away from this vendor.Roger S.
1,Sad,"This movie was just horrible! I'd rather see the cartoon version by Disney then this. You never get hooked in with a plot, if you can even find out the plot. The acting is done horriblly. The directing is also horrible. There is nothing right with this movie except the fact that Drew Barrymore is in it. Even she's horrible in this movie. Go see a good movie with her in it like The Wedding Singer. Skip this movie, but if you must, rent it first. Trust me, you won't like it."
4,A good story for any crowd.,"I thought that the movie was well very well made. It was full of emotion, one minute you are about to cry and the next you are leaping out of your seat. This movie definitely has something for everyone. Chock full of love, action, and right out happiness."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"I am a HUGE Drew Barrymore fan and I thought her performance in this movie was great! It's a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie no matter age or gender. My brother, a Korn fan and lover of fighting movies, enjoyed this movie very much. My dad, who usually doesn't like 'teen flicks', thought this was one of the greatest movies he's ever seen and that is straight from his mouth! I absolutely loved the plot, costumes, and scenery and the acting was SUPERB! Well, that's all for know."
5,The best I have seen in a LONG time!,I think it is the GREATEST movie I have seen in a long time!!! Enuf said :)
4,"feminist twist, with Leonardo da Vinci as fairy godmother","When my daughter put this on, I was skeptical, to say the least. Oy, I thought, another bad romantic comedy. Well, I am happy to report that I was dead flat wrong: this is a funny, intelligent take on a an old story and it really works. The actors are uniformly excellent and the story is even somewhat believable. Cinderella is a tough smart chick, the prince is rebellious and open-minded, and Leonardo is a wise manipulator. This is a really fun watch, witty and with good values and not stupidly unrealialistic or blankly politically correct.I recommend this for family watching. There is something in it for everyone."
5,A truly great movie,"This movie had great acting, a great story (of course), and great costumes. Plus, it was set in medeival times, like most really cool movies.I watch it over and over."
5,Very Fun!,"Ever After is a great take on the classic Cinderella story. I loved the touch that references to Sir Thomas More's Utopia gave. Drew Barrymore puts in a pretty good performance as Cinderella, but I found her acting a little fake at times. Dougray Scott is wonderful (in looks and acting) as the dashing prince, and Anjelica Huston plays a totally convincing and detestable step mother. The music and scenery and costumes are all very lovely. I found the ending a bit too abrupt-I guess I just want stories like this to go on and on!"
4,I love Drew in this movie,I think this movie is so cute and so good. I love that it is like the original Cinderalla story but in a way it is not. I love Drew in this movie. She is so sweet and it was like the role was made for her. But I do think that it is a chick flick. My finance did not think it was that great but I loved it. So I would suggest women to see it.
5,By K.R-- EVER AFTER IS THE MOST CREATIVE FAIRY TALE YET,"So many movies today are filled with bad language, violence andadult situations. However, Ever After contains none of thefollowing. It's nice to know that there are actually descent movies to watch. Ever After gives a twist to the original story. This is what makes it interesting. The music is really beautiful in the movie.The costumes are authentic and there is beautiful scenary. I found funny parts in the movie too. Unlike the old cinderella where she was weak and feeble, cinderella is actually strong minded. This movie was very creative. It did a good job of turning the original story around. Ever After is sure to be in the classic section years from now.FIVE STARS!"
4,Terrific Modern Version of Cinderella,"Ever After is one of my favorite films. I saw it when it came out and I've just watched the DVD. It tells the Cinderella story in a new way. This Cinderella is gutsier, braver and more believable than the classic story book story would have us think. She knows about equality and independence and she's outspoken. Her Prince Charming is really cute, too! Angelica Huston's Wicked Stepmother is a lot of fun, though the viewer wants to protect Cinderella from her. I highly recommend this movie."
5,The best cinderella version....,"Ever After is the REAL cinderella story, as it would've most likely occured. Not only is the setting beautiful, and the acting superb, but the script in this film is amazing. This film is funny, charming, witty and very romantic. There is drama, comedy, action, romance, betrayal, everything you could ever ask for in a good movie. You'll have no regrets."
5,A Diamond in the Rough,They sure don't make movies like these anymore. It's one of the best I've seen and the best Drew Barrymore is in. This movie is wholesome as well as it's entertaining. I just wish I could see more like this.
5,Just classic,The film has a special meaning to my husband and I as it came out when we were dating in 6th grade and was the first movie we saw together. I purchased it as a date night idea for when he gets back from deployment and I've been watching it with the kids in the meantime. Our 6yr old and 3yr old love it and I'm glad that it's the kind of movie in which they can watch and it doesn't have sex or foul language in it. I'm definitely happy with this purchase.
5,5 Stars Hands Down,This was a superb retelling of the story. Dougray Scott played his part well and a charming prince at that.
5,Great movie!,One of my favorite movie! I've watched it more then five times. It's a good one for anyone who like watch it on a girls' night out.
4,Enjoyable Movie,"My two young girls really enjoy this movie and have seen it many times. What an nice twist on the Cinderella plot. Drew Barrymore is wonderful and her character, Gabrielle, is an inspiration."
4,Surprisingly good: not just another fairy tale.,"This version of an old tale is enlivened by a great cast. Anjelica Huston gave a five star performance as the conniving step mother. Scott's performance as prince charming is very convincing. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is no longer cast in the victimised role but as somebody who can fend for herself. However, the ending is in my opinion rather too tame. It seemed too easy for Danielle to escape the clutches of the landlord to whom she was sold. It appeared as if she was never in any real danger at all. The viewers were not allowed to root for her very much. The wedding scene was a little too over acted. Overall, however, it is very entertaining and out of the ordinary, not just another fairy tale."
4,A New Twist on Cinderella,"This is probably Drew Barrymore's best movie since ET. It is a light hearted twist on the classic fairy tale Cinderella. The movie starts of with the life of Cinderella before the death of her father and developes all the characters in more depth. The movie is great for kids of all ages, especially those who are older. Its humerous and realistic at the same time. Much better than the Disney Cartoon."
4,Utopia!,"Given low expectations, no matter how well-recommended, this film can't help but succeed. It's a competent, well-made redoing of the Cinderella story, marred by a couple of narrative cliches (Cinderella's granddaughter telling the Brothers Grimm how it ""really"" happened, some petty vengeance scenes) and some throwaway lines.Barrymore's luminosity shines through her limitations as an actress; every scene she's in is carried by her heartfelt performance. Angelica Huston is also brilliant as the very arch, evil stepmother. Dougray Scott is adequate as the prince, but one is grateful that he wasn't able to do ""Wolverine"" for the X-Men movie after watching this. The stepsisters were entertaining, though it was nice to see Melanie Lynskey (""Heavenly Creatures"") again.The story kind of lurches, and the throw-away lines and scenes begin to wear on the good will generated by some of the plot innovations. Still, it's a good story, with basically a good heart, and well worth watching."
5,Finally!! A Cinderella story I will let my daughter watch.,This charming story finally fills the void in children's entertainment. A young woman who needs no rescuing and captures the heart of her prince with her intelligence and thoughtfulness is an appropriate heroine for today's girls.
5,I love this video,"This video is wonderful for all ages. Children will love it for the Cinderella Story, and adults will love it for its clear view and subtle undertones. Setting the classic fairy tale in a real time and place has brought it to life for me."
5,AMAZING!!,"drew barrymore is a wonderful actress, my favorite. i thought this movie was the best movie ever, better than anything. i loved it. it showed real strength, and courgae of a woman, and a romantic love story. the cast was wonderful and real. if you have not seen this movie yet, i suggest you go see it, you won't be disapointed."
4,"Very enjoyable, well done. Drew great!","I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was moving, funny and contained unexpected surprises , and not too many of them. I like a good love-theme movie that makes my heart thump and ache. This one did it! Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful and relaxing,"Absolutely wonderful and relaxing movie to watch. My husband, usually an action-movie person, was also won over by the movie as well. My recommendations for people who just want a simple and easy movie to watch, especially during illness and you just want a movie to relax, without having to grill your brains to think about the plot and complexities of it. I would also recommend the soundtrack of the movie, as the music is fabulous and calming."
4,WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT?,"Did the screenwriter make a typo in the script? It says this purportedly ""real"" story took place in the 1600s. Especially, if it involved Leonardo da Vinci, don't ya think it would have involved the correct time frame: the 1500s? Mr. da Vinci died in England in 1519, stupid scriptwriter!"
4,Going back to the olden times. 15th april 2004.,"Danielle de barbarac is a servant, thats the job she does, her cruel mother is like an enemy to her, she can never anything right. [The posh dresses, just like the olden days]."
3,A Cinderalla (more love) Story,This Drew Barrymore movie is a great love story. It is just like Cinderalla but sees him more.
5,LOVE IT!,"This movie was so good. I have seen almost every movie that has come out this year, and this was by far the best romantic one. It was excellent and I recommend it to everyone."
5,BEST DREW MOVIE YET!!!!,"I THOUGHT THAT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT! I'VE SEEN IT THREE TIMES AND LIKED IT BETTER EACH TIME. I WOULD LIKE IT IF A SOUNDTRACK CAME OUT, THE MUSIC WAS WONDERFULL. THE MOVIE WAS A BIT PREDICTABLE."
5,This is such a great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ever After is a great retelling of Cinderella. It is very well done, and the actors and actresses were well chosen. Drew Barrymore does the best job playing Danielle, the Cinderella of the story.You absolutely must see this movie!"
4,"An excellent,clean movie that you and your kids can enjoy","This movie is Drew Barrymore's best role yet. She does a wonderful job of playing ""Cinderella"" and is delightfully cheerful. It has a sad beginning and a happy ending. There is only one naughty word in there,but nothing to be fearful about. I would recommend this movie to anyone!!!!"
5,THE GREATEST CINDERELLA STORY EVER!,"DREW BARRYMORE OUT DOES HERSELF.SHE TAKES THE ROLE OF CINDERELLA AND MAKES IT HER OWN.A SURPRISING TWIST TO AN OLD STORY LINE.A CLEAN FAMILY FILM THAT YOU CAN WATCH WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY.I LOVED THIS MOVIE,AND I CAN'T WAIT UNTL IT COMES OUT ON VIDEO!"
3,It just didn't strike me as all that good,I know a lot of people who love this movie and I thaught is was good but... If I took a movie survey this movie would check out perfectly but I just didn't think it was all that good. (My friends think I am crazy too)
2,"Soppy, silly but Good Acting.","Danielle (Drew Barrymore : The Wedding Singer, Never Been Kissed) is playing sweet and innocent Cinderella who is also very strong. When the love of her life played by Dougray Scott has coem for a few weeks to stay at her evil step mothers (Angelica Huston : The Addams Family, The Addams Family Values) castle things turn from romance to disaster.This movie would probably be preffered by the people who are ""romancy"" but this soppy stuff is not by sort of thing."
5,"In two word ""The Best!""","I saw this movie with all of my friends around Augest nad we are STILL talking about it!!!! It's not your normal Fairy Tale!!!!!! This is funny, Sad, and exciting all in one!!"
5,A stunning version of the Cinderella classic.,I have many versions of this beloved classic and did not think this would meet up to the standards. I was proven to be delightfully wrong. Drew is a most believable Cinderella and the visuals were stunning. My compliments.
5,GRRRRRRRREAT!!!!!!!!!!,I love this movie it has so much character and spirt. The leading lady (Drew Barreymore) plays a much better Cinderella I have ever seen!
5,Favorite romantic movie,This movie is one of the most romantic movies and I love the story and the music through out it.
4,A pleasant tale,"Never really did bother watching this film when it came out...but beholdi finally did, and im sure glad that i did, because after a few films i can now say that Drew Barrimore is one fine actress that wont get on yournerves. She is sourrounded by other wonderfull talent, costumes, castles and great scenery.This Cinderella tale is refreshing movie that will entertain you to thefullest."
5,1 of my all time favorites!,"There are no words to describe this movie. It is 1 of my all time favorites! It is full of interesting story lines, beautiful people and of course your classic romantic fairytale only told in a real life way. I love this movie! I've watched it hundreds of times and I never get sick of it!"
5,This movie is great:-),This movie was spectacular i cried four times during this movie.Drew barrymore was amazing it was as if i were in the movie and i was her.I recommend this to everyone.
5,Very well done!!!!,"This was one of the best moives ever! I went with two friends and it was AWESOME!! We were the only ones in the entire theater who showed emotions to the story. I cried many times, died laughing and sat through the entire movie on edge of my seat. I loved it!!"
5,The Greatest Cinderella Ever !!,"This Movie was wonderful! It had a great plot, not like Disney's Version. Even The Music was better. And Drew ROCKS!!!"
2,Why does everyone say this is great movie?,"Why does everyone put four or five stars for this movie??? Barrymore is completly miss casting as Cinderella. She is not a image of Cinderella at all to me. Only Anjelica Houston is correct at casting as the step mother. I enjoyed the ""Disney Cinderella"" more than this. I shouldn't of bought this video and I wish my money will come back!!!"
1,Entertainment It's Not,"This movie is not even close to the original Cinderella. Being rife with with feminism, Utopianism, class struggle and even some situational ethics, I felt that I was being given a political lecture rather than being entertained. Cinderella, in this version, rescued the prince and herself, certainly a departure from the origninal story. The prince was uncertain if he wanted to marry Cinderella because of her class. The gypsy-robbers were portrayed as being honorable while the prince apologized for his lack of honor.The scenery was pretty at times, but overall it looked low-budget, especially the scenes from the ball.The characters were miscast and boring except for Angelica Huston who played the role of the stepmother well. I don't know how this movie got 5 stars as it has virtually no redeeming features."
5,Fantastic,"This movie is for the ultimate romanctic person! Guys, if your looking for something for your girlfriend or wife...here it is!"
5,I totally loved it.,Drew Barrymore is a great actor. this movie really touched me.I cant wait till it comes out on video.
5,Oh my Gosh!!!!!!!,This movie is soooooooo amazing. I love it. I loved it soooo much that I went to see it one night and saw it again the next night. Anybody who hasen't seen it has to see it!!
5,Niece loved it,"Gave as a gift Received in time, Really annoyed I have to type so many words before you will take my rating! :-/"
5,One of my favorites,A classic remodeling of a classic tale. I love this story -- always have. It's a must for every collection!
3,Great for Drew Barrymore fans,"Another version of a Cinderella story. I enjoyed this one because I am a big fan of Drew Barrymore. I liked this one because it showed how close she was to the other ""servants"" and the lengths to which she would go for them. Anjelica Huston makes a perfect wicked stepmother."
5,Austen + Classic Fairy Tale = Can't Miss!,"This is truly a great movie. Yeah, it's the story of Cinderella, slightly revised. I know that, you know that, enjoy it for what it is. It's really not as trite as it seems. They did a good job expanding a relatively simple, 1-dimensional story line into something more reminiscent of Pride & Prejudice, I daresay! by turning ""Prince Charming"" into a spoiled snob, and ""Cinderella"" into a modern-thinking wit. Dougray and Drew are great in their roles and have wonderful chemistry together. And the addition of Leonardo da Vinci? Perfect!The accents are a nice try, but in their defense, to be ""historically"" accurate they would've had to speak French, so let it go.I have seen this movie dozens of times and I'll watch it a dozen more. It's just good fun. 5 stars!"
5,I am impressed.,"I have never been a big fan of Drew Barrymore before, but I must admit, she did a wonderful job in this movie. Angelica Houston is always a marvel and the reason I decided to watch the movie. This movie is now a favorite of mine and one I can watch over and over again without losing interest in the characters. This Cinderella version is more realistic to recent times in that Danielle (Barrymore) isn't a helpless, weak female that is dependent on a prince to save her life. Instead, Danielle saves him emotionally and spiritually. This love story really tugs at the heart strings and is the dream that the little girl within our hearts hopes to find one day."
4,A Deliciously Romantic Adventure,"This movie is pure cotton candy, and I adore it. Could I be more in love with Dougray Scott? A great story, a bit of adventure and a happy ending! What more do you need? The only thing missing from the DVD is more extras, but at least the trailer is there; I love the music they play on it."
5,One of Drew's best!,"This movie was absolutely spectacular.Wherever this movie was filmed it is absolutely beautiful, the acting is superb, and the costumes are absolutely gorgeous. Drew does such an amazing job as the lead. Her acting just took my breath away and Anjelica Houston did an excellent job playing her evil stepmother and Dougray Scott was perfect for the part as the prince. This movie made me both laugh and cry. I recommend this movie to all ages. I believe that it is a movie for everyone. It has action, romance,drama and a little bit of comedy. Ever After is da bomb!"
4,"Go, Drew!","Possibly the best film I have seen Drew Barrymore in, as of late (""Charlie's Angels"" takes a different turn on the estrogen kick.) She is a completely pro-active heroine, and that is SO appealling and much more interesting to watch over the more traditional self-abnegating Cinderella character we are familiar with. Of course, she has wonderful support- from Anjelica Huston (deliciously evil as the stepmother), Patrick Godfrey as an adorable Leonardo DaVinci, Dougray Scott as the Prince, and veteran actress Jean Moreau, who plays her great-great-great granddaughter, narrating the story for the record to the ""Brothers Grimm."" Beautifully filmed, simple story-telling and fairly accurate costuming make for an enchanting couple of hours."
4,Why did I like this movie?,"I would have to say that I truly did like this movie. But why?, I'm a guy. All I know is that I started watching it with my sisters so I could make fun of it. But I couldn't think of anything to make fun of so I really got into it. Oh and another thing I'm not gay. Watch this movie with your mom or sisters or girlfriend(s) its not that bad."
2,Review of Blu Ray Quality Not Movie,"I love this movie, I would give it 5 stars if I was just rating the movie. However, this review is for the quality of the Blu Ray. It went on sale and I was very happy I was going to be able to replace my DVD copy. As soon as I started watching it I realized the quality was possibly even worse than my DVD. I would have to play them side by side to make an accurate assessment. The picture was grainy and in some spots blurry. The other odd thing was in scenes where Leonardo is wearing a white hat, there is a double halo/shadow effect going on. When there is a scene with bright light (for example any outdoor scene) the entire shot is blown out. When it's dark, the black is grainy with no crispness whatsoever. I literally felt like I was watching an old VCR edition. This movie is so beautifully shot and such a wonderful story I am so disappointed the blu-ray didn't live up to my expectations."
5,Magnificent,"Absolutely wonderful from beginning to end - a masterful and beautifully captured story which will be a favourite for years. I hadn't seen the film when I purchased the DVD, but many of my friends reccommended it, and as soon as the menu appeared on my screen, I knew I would love it. The disc is otherwise fairly bare-bones in terms of features, although the sound and picture quality is perfect, as is the film itself."
5,",1 September 1999,a lovely Cinderella type story",This movie is so romantic and so touching.Drew Barrymore plays this role very well.You watch it you like it!i guarantee!
1,Blu Ray Picture Quality,"I'll just comment on the blu ray picture which is the worst I've seen yet - it even has dirt.There was no care taken with this film, there are no extras it is as bare bones as the original dvd. The movie is quite good and deserved better treatment. Buyers beware."
5,A Truly Magnificent Fairytale,"There are two things I love about this movie. First, it is beautiful. The actors are beautiful (especially Dougray Scott). The costumes are beautiful. The scenery is beautiful. Watching this movie, makes me feel as if I am part of the fairytale. Second, this is a great twist on the Cinderella story. We see a girl who has been beaten down in almost all aspects of her life, but does not allow her spirit to be beaten. Trying to save one of her beloved servants (though she has become a servant herself) she goes to court to free him, also meeting the prince. He is, of course, smitten, and she keeps up a masquerade of a lady, in order to continue seeing him. The story follows the basics of the Cinderella tale (slipper, wicked stepmother), but in this case, we have a Cinderella who doesn't need a prince to save her, just to love her for who she is. In any case, this is a wonderful movie. Problems are resolved quickly, and in the end, everyone gets their just desserts."
5,Forever After,"This is one of my fav films. Drew Barrymore stars as Danielle, a modern 16th century woman. She is no wimp. Faced with the death of her beloved father & then the cruelty of her stepmother and one of two stepsisters, Danielle still has optimism & a sunny view of life. She uses her mind as well as her charm to win the admiration and heart of the dashing Prince Henry (newcomer Dougray Scott).When Danielle is sold to the lecherous Pierre Le Pieu (the deliciously wicked Richard O'Brien), Prince Henry goes to rescue her. But Danielle needs no rescuing. She has the situation well in hand as Henry discovers when he sees her exit Le Pieu's castle, her freedom & virtue intact.As always, Anjelica Huston gives a winning performance as the Baroness, Danielle's cruel stepmother. She & Richard O'Brien give villainy a new name.I think everyone will enjoy this version of the Cinderella story. It is one to treasure forever."
3,Ever After: A Cinderalla Story,"I only gave this movie a three star. It was an ok movie. Drew Barrymore's father in the movie remarrys, dies and she is left with a geedy stepmother who turns her into a servant. But alas, all ends well when she meets and marrys prince charming."
5,My favorite movie! HANDS DOWN!!!!!!,I could watch this movie over and over again I never seem to get tired of it. If you love fairy tales that are not cartoons well you'll definitely love this movie.
5,This is probabley the absolute best movie i have ever seen!!,"This movie is great for all ages! I am thirteen, though I know that most of my elders and youngers would thoroughly enjoy this as well. It's also a great version for a feminist! Drew Barrymoore is so cool, and puts on a great performance! This is definitely worth your money!"
4,Highly recommended,"This is a wonderful retelling of the classic fairy-tale. At first I didn't want to see that movie, but I'm sure glad I did. It does have its flaws, but I loved the score. Anjelica Huston gave an excellent performanceas the wicked stepmother."
5,Ever After,This movie is one of the best movies I ever saw. It is a classic tale of love that has been used since the time of Cinderella. I encourage all people to watch this movie so that they san see what real love is.That is my review!
4,Charming,"A lovely, well made film that re-tells the classic story of Cinderella giving it a dab of 'realism'.Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott are excellent as Danielle and the Prince but their romance isn't too overwhelmingly sweet.Angelica Huston is brilliant as the stepmother without over playing it.One of the best scene's is when Danielle and the Prince are captured by gypsy's and the leader tells Danielle she can leave and take anything she can carry with her - just wait til you see what she picks up!"
3,pretty sweet,"I thought this film was pretty good but I wouldn't rave about it; so the sets were nice and it the sweet ending but that was about it. And Drew Barrymore's accent was appaling. We don't speak like that!! Also, the power thing was slightly annoying, I didn't want her to be pathetic but her 'boldness' wasn't realistic."
4,A wonderful twist...,"Ever After is a wonderful twist on the entire Cinderella fairytale. Drew Barrymore comes across as a strong willed Cinderella that knows what she wants out of life, which isn't what she currently has. Prince Charming desperately needs her, otherwise, he's a weak kneed fool that bends to everyone else's wishes. The battle of wills between the two is amusing and Barrymore shines, as she always does."
5,Great Movie,The movie was great! Almost everything about it was perfect! The acting was really cool! The whole story was great for one thing. And I like that they had a little bit of history in it and I love history!
4,"Absolutely, a very enjoyable movie for all ages.","This movie was not what I had expected. I was expecting this version of the story to be somewhat predictable and mundane. However I was surprised at how much I found myself get into the movie. Even though I guess I generally knew the outcome of the story would be a 'and they lived happily ever after', I still found myself really getting into it, the feeling of anticipation that children feel at full force when watching/reading fairytale type things was brought back to me mildly (age 20). The inqusitive mind of a realist(my father) who can never be bothered watching all of a movie stayed up and watched the whole thing. So you can see the strong affects of this movie. Anyway, a must see for those who want to experience the cinderella story unspoilt."
4,"An entertaining twist to an old fable. Fun, cute, funny.","I found ""Ever After-Cinderella Story"" fun and entertaining. It took an old favorite fable and added a new twist. One without any magic. A must for the romantic. This is one for the home video library."
4,Format discrepency,"By the way, this movie is Double Layer, not single (Check the layer switch at 70:10 or confirm by looking at the disc: it's gold in the back!!"
5,Excellent Movie!!!,"This is a great movie! It has everything to attract everyone, men or women! Action, romance, laughs, everything. Everyone plays there part well and together they make up a great movie! I can watch this over and over, I highly recommend!"
2,Kindle Version,"There is a serious problem with the Kindle version of this book. On many occasions, the difference between dotted and undotted i, [I can't seem to upload a review with the correct letters either], g and yumasak g and even sometimes s with the cedilla is not clear. Those differences are vital in Turkish, especially for beginners (like me). My guess is that this is due to optical character reading problems.I suspect this will be cleared up in the future. Kindle is still a new technology, and in just about every other respect it's been wonderful.When it is cleared up, though, I hope re-downloads are free.Gerry Schulze"
2,Horrible pronunciations,"This book has some useful information about ""daily"" Turkish. Some slangs and corrupted form of expressions which is used by many Turkish people today. However if you're looking for a book teaches Turkish Language ""Literally"", this book is not for you.If you are interested in cassettes included, don't buy this book. Pronunciation in coversations are horrible. No intonations and no rhythm. All men are speaking with a Eastern Turkey accent.Might be useful for teaching eastern accent, and corrupted expressions."
1,discouraging chaos,"I am learning Turkish and bought this -at first sight promising- book. This book is uncomprehensible and right-on discouraging for beginners, one gets stuck into dialogues with some -but not 100 %- explanations and translations, while turning pages after pages from dialogue, to explanation to 'key' and finally to my own dictionairy. After lesson 2 I gave up. There are much, much better courses. This book is really written by teachers ??"
3,A mess. Loved it.,"If the Three Stooges teamed up with Benny Hill and Red Skelton to make a horror movie, this might be it. The performers at this freak show have a great time, the audience in the bleachers not so much. But it's after the audience has left that the real fun begins. That's when the freaks conjure up the power of the darkness. This involves buckets of blood and an abundance of body piercing (made me look away). The story, as far as I could tell, involves a battle between two underground forces, one of which unleashes the dead, who rise up as zombies. As a movie, this thing is a mess, as great fun, it's great fun."
5,Sublime Music and Artistry,I completely agree with the gentleman from South Australia's review. This DVD is extraordinary in every way. The orchestral playing by Rousset's Les Talens Lyrique is superbly recorded and his phrasing of Mozart could not be better.Ms. Piau should consider recording more Mozart with the same forces.Do not hesitate to purchase this DVD. The sound is superb also.
1,Good luck receiving what you order,"My kids love Mac and Cheese. I feel really good about giving it to them when it's loaded with vitamins. I ordered a case of the Spider man Super Mac and Cheese. I did receive Spiderman Mac Cheese, but it isn't the Super Mac Cheese with the whole grain and extra vitamins. I'm very hesitant to order it again."
4,Very Glad to have read this.,"This book is well organized and easily read. Research is outstanding. For me, the great mystery of WW 1, was how and why it started. This book answers those questions. I found the first twenty or so pages about the effects of the war on the people of the warring nations, and the final twenty or so pages on the consequences of the war, particularly interesting and even applicable to today's world.The rest of the book is a well written military history of the campaigns, battles, and behind the scenes activities that impacted the war. After reading this account, I began to understand why my grandparents, born in 1892, never spoke much about it.Read this book to understand much of our modern world."
4,"So the Generals Were Fools, or mad","Keegan makes a persuasive case that the WW I Generals who became household names were fools, or mad . Oddly,Keegan has no new information on the men who ran the war. He looks back at the slaughter and rightly concludes that the leaders made a mess of the entire escapade, besides killing humongous millions for no sensible end . Great stuff. But Keegan now owes us an explanation of military leaders as a group. Are they all con artists, madmen or just incompetents?"
3,Great book for the national war college.,"Mr. Keegan is a great researcher and the detail of order of battle in this book is commendable, but for what audience? This book would be better suited for a national war college. If the author is cartographically-impaired he should have employed someone to have provided maps to go with his prose. If on the other hand, the editors excised them, they should be shot for dereliction of duty.Martin Gilbert's treatment of this horrible conflict, while also map deficient, captures the human element and vividly describes the war fronts with his wonderful anecdotes from common soldiers and nurses to the men who would have the reins during the second major global conflict of the 20th century."
3,Not for Casual Listening,"This is nor for the car, doing laundry, jogging or anything that does not allow for complete attention. You will need a pen and paper and it would be very helpful to have battle reference maps (perhaps by the hardcopy version to accompany the tapes).His points are well constructed, but you would not know that if you took your mind off of the barrage of details, facts, figures and minute geographical references that he peppers into his argument. I would not buy the audio version again, but might be interested in the hardcopy. Then again, I'd probably never take the time to read the hard copy."
3,Can't see the forest.,"Keegan describes military events but confuses them with history. Our century saw Germany achieve European hegemony - in spite of itself - while ""Great"" Britain self destructed and Russia blew its shot at leadership. Moving pins around on maps is kind of fun, but it doesn't tell humanity much about why tens of millions were very cruelly murdered and unimagined wealth was simply blown up. Keegan is undoubtedly very well informed, but his ""explanation"" of the 1914-18 war comes across as rationalization - victor's history. Our world should have learned from WWI and its aftermath that while soldiers ""do or die"" they do not ""reason why."" We need reasons, not battlefied monuments."
2,Detail drowns analysis,"Could not agree less with professional reviewer who said the book does a good job of making technical detail understandable. I thought the detail was excessive when compared to the analysis asserted. May be a good book for historians, but not the general reader."
5,a must for starters,This book is a very well written and comprehensive book about the causes and the battles of World War one on the Western as well as on the Eastern front. It is an excellent book for anyone who wants to start to learn about this war.
3,"Authoritative, comprehensive but few surprises","which may be the point. Keegan is a very reliable historian. He takes a steady, thoughtful, thorough approach to the build up to the first world war and then leads his readers step by long step through the war. While readers will find little to argue with I will venture to guess that they will find little to delight or astound them either. The sections on Serbia and the Eastern front in particular offer interesting reading though the book in general feels like a textbook."
4,A good historical account,"This is a well researched and very inclusive book, but the author is no Stephen Ambrose in that his account is often dry and not that readable. This book is best for those who want an overall narrative about the war that includes every aspect (the section on the Gallipoli campaign is particulary enlightening). Keegan also does a good job in documenting just how much World War I has shaped subsequent historical events. Overall, a good read for history buffs but probably not for the average reader."
5,The Usuaul Superb Keegan Military History,"Simply put, John Keegan is the finest miltary historian in the world. I do not read his works for their action, their depth of character, or their poetic qualities--these are not his strong suit, and I understand why the reviewers who prefer novels to history have been less than overly kind (my advice: read a novel). I read Keegan because he is a master of analysis, of both strategy and tactics, even-handed and thorough, and an engrossing explicator of battlefield situations. I'm never quite sure when he's about to drop a bomb that will make me look at his topic in an utterly new way. So no, Keegan doesn't explain why so much blood and gold went into this war (has anyone? *Can* anyone?), but he does provide a sterling, thoughtful overview of the war, its origins, development, and consequences. If Keegan would do us Yanks the honor of writing a full-length analysis of our Civil War, I'd kiss him on his ruddy English cheek."
2,"The ""British"" First World War","I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?"
3,"Dense History, Map Impaired","Keegan is an academic historian, not a writer of popular history. Consequently this book is heavy on the big picture -- each movement of an army, identified by its commander, is detailed -- but not a lot of information or feeling about the rank and file. Little to nothing about civilians. In other words, this is a book about the men who had the trenches dug, and why they did so, not one about the people who dug the trenches and lived and died in them.And, most disappointing, somebody decided maps weren't important. Whole chapters go by without any way to see what Keegan is talking about. Important battles are fought in cities that can't be found... months of fighting over unlocatable rivers. This is a history of the World of 80 years ago, of Imperial Europe, and it barely shows us where Poland was. If ever there were a book that needs an atlas, this was it. Really, really too bad."
4,Comprehensive but very dense,"There is wonderful detail in this work but for me, as a casual reader, it was a little too dense and academic. As other reviewers have mentioned, the maps provided are too few and somewhat confusing. Additionally, Keegan's accounts of individual fighting units need more context and explanation for the beginning armchair historian. Keegan assumes his reader already has a working knowledge of warfare generally and the Great War in particular. If this is your first book about WWI, perhaps you should chose another one to familiarize yourself with the basics - then choose Keegan to deepen your understanding."
2,World Bore One,Like sominex in a dust jacket. Keegan covers familiar ground in thuddingly dull fashion. Tough sledding even for history buffs.
2,Overrated,"The lack of maps is only one probem. This book is far less a narrative than it is a litany of facts (armies, corps, battles, leaders, etc.). Only rarely does Keegan employ compelling, elegant prose as described on the book's jacket. His paragraphs, at times, ramble beyond an entire page. Keegan also appears fond of changing subjects completely within the same paragraph. An apt question would be, ""Where were his editors?"" I found Keegan's ""The Face of Battle"" to be a wonderful, fascinating read. This book falls far short of its potential."
1,Turning excitement into boredom,"I have heard Mr. Keegan speak in person, read his other books,I have taught World War I and find it a fascinating subject.So I was anxious to read this book. What a disappointment! Is this another case of author burnout? riding the wave of past glory? I am more than 3/4 of a way through the book and I am tempted to stop. He has taken an awesome topic and turned it in to something as dry as sawdust. Historians usually agree that this war was a turning point in so many ways. This is not coming across in this book. The human dimension is missing here-much too technical. His writing style gets in the way. About every 3 or 4 pages he produces a sentence structure that leaves me wondering ""What was that?"" Where was his editor? Missing like most these days? Or once you become THE John Keegan, you don't need an editor? This book is historian/writer burnout at is worst."
4,Portrays titanic size and futility of WW1,"Separated as we are from the Great War by an even greater war, we can lose sight of its enormity. Keegan's opening and closing chapters vividly portray the vast opening battles of maneuver and the awful cost in life. By comparison, its middle chapters seem muddy and bogged down, but this catchphrase would, in a nutshell, describe the First World War."
4,A Very Well-Written History,"John Keegan has managed to write this book, covering the whole of the First World War, and he has done it well. As other reviewers have said, this history is not radical or vastly different but it is very clear. Managing to convey the horror of the war whilst remaining impartial and focused is no easy matter. Here, Keegan has managed to do this.I definately recomend it."
3,Erudite but boring at times,"I love history and history books. I had great hopes for this one since I have read others by the author but the prose seems almost disconnected at time. There is LOTS of background and LOTS of evidence to support various conjectures, but somehow these seem disjointed from the tale. The book was packed full of information but that data seemed almost unrelated to the story. And he committed the worst sin of a writer - he bored. Better luck next time, John."
2,Cries Out for a Rewrite,"I have finally finished the book. In an earlier review, I choked on the poor writing style--you can see this review a few weeks earlier at Amazon. Keegan needs to revise this book, and this time, he must take control of the map making. There are not enough maps (lots of earlier reviewers have complained about this), and the person who made the maps did not read what is written in the text. First, there needs to be five times as many maps. Secondly, the towns that were involved in the battles must be shown on the maps. Thirdly, the maps must show topology--we need to see the mountains, lakes, and bogs (and how about boundaries between the countries?). Can you believe that there is only one major map showing all the Western battle fields from 1914 to 1918 and that appears on about page 125? I am going to the library and search for a better book on WW1."
3,"A Competent, Intelligent Narrative Summary","Keegan's work is a competent, intelligent and well-researched narrative summary of the War to End All Wars. Unfortunatly, it is also very dry reading. Also, even at the relatively superficial level of detail with which the war's great battles are outlined, there is a disappointing paucity of maps. As the author describes the movements of armies, corps and divisions here, there and everywhere relative to cities, rivers, lakes and other topographical features, the reader is left with an incomplete picture of the tactical situation. However, I liked the book enough to finish it, and was left with much greater degree of knowledge about the subject than I had when I started. A marginal ""thumbs up""."
3,"Good Narrative, No Maps","In my mind a comprehensive, factual explanation of the military aspects of The Great War. Keegan does not dwell excessively on the political aspects that contributed to the conflict, but he correctly points out that it need not have happened, and that the combatants were woefully unprepared to prosecute such a war. I would give it more stars, but for the glaring absence of adequate maps."
4,"War of the World, 1914","This is a fine one volume history of the Great War. Yet in spite of the dense factual material, I found myself confused by the repetitive numeration of military units, without enough maps to help. The book is stronger on diplomatic activities that led up to the fighting, but does not provide the rich full description of the personalities leading the fight, which is done better in Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman.Descriptions of the titanic battles on the Eastern Front are helpful, and the explanation of the collapse of Tsarist Russia is an eye-opener for those who prefer to focus on the Western Front. TEN MILLION died for nothing, only to see greater tragedy 20 years later. How foolish were the elite diplomats, generals, and royalty; so much of classical European civilization destroyed. Here are the roots of problems in Eastern Europe and the Middle East."
2,My kingdom for a map...or two....or try lots!,"Well-written and interesting account of the events of the first world war. The text would be better elucidated with the aid of maps indicating troop placements, battle field movements, as well as the geography and topography. Words are fine, but maps would have replaced half the text and saved some trees. Great book for filling in the history gaps, next time try a few maps."
2,Poor Use of English Language for an Important Subject,"You should believe the other reviewers when they say the writing is poor. Let me give you an example from page 27: ""Though A.J.P. Taylor was flippantly wrong to characterize the outbreak of 1914 as 'war by timetable,' since statesmen might have averted it at any time, given goodwill, by ignoring professional military advice, the characterization is accurate in a deeper sense."" Do you get the idea? Every paragraph has sentences like that, making this book difficult to read. On the positive side, his knowledge is deep and wide, but you are going to have to dig.I just finished Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August""--what a difference. I wish I knew of another book on this general subject so I could recommend it. Tuchman's book covers only about the first 30 days of the war."
3,Hit and Miss,"Overall a worthwhile read. One challenge with the book was the emphasis on the logistics of battles. It was difficult to conceptualize much of those descriptions, even with the occasional map included. For someone with a knack for wrapping their mind around the layout of a battlefield and troop movements, etc... much of the content might be welcome, but I certainly struggled to push through some of those portions. Keegan did pepper the book with enough information on the larger picture, however, to keep me interested enough to finish the book and gain some insight into the history of WWI."
3,"Strong on battle strategy, but lacks personal touch","Keegan does an excellent job in this book of explaining the battle strategy of the generals and leaders of the warring countries. For an overview of the war's battles and tactics, it is top notch. I grew frustrated, however, with a missing personal touch. For example, there were was very little coverage of the everyday life of a soldier in the battle, or what it was like to be in a trench. Still, it is worth reading. One other criticism I have is that the maps are poor. While Keegan does an excellent job of detailing battles around small villages and towns, theose same towns are nowhere to be seen on the maps in the book. I found myself using maps from other books to follow along with the reading. I'd reccomend this, but be aware of what you are getting."
3,Expecting More,"I couldn't agree more with the distinguished gentleman cslinks, whose commentary on the physical condition of the book I found to be both insightful and uncannily accurate. I have followed cslinks' reviews of other books with a great deal of interest, and invariably buy and read the books he recommends. I would encourage all users of Amazon.com to do the same, as I suspect cslinks may be a high-level publishing executive whose opinions carry much weight."
4,Pretty deep stuff but enlightening,"I'll readily admit that reading good war novels like War of the Rats or The Triumph & the Glory or Gods and Generals is easier than wading through serious history, but the effort is worth it with John Keegan's books. He has a grasp of the human element in conflict as well as a manner of presenting the political and social aspects of the era in question that render the topic, if not as fascinating as a Grisham thriller, at least interesting enough to pursue. One always learns some lessons from Keegan--lessons that were won at a horrific price by the generation in question."
4,Easy reading with great anecdotes and explanations,Keegan brings out little details relating more to the reasoning than the rationality of why battles were fought and mens lives wasted. His explanations of the courseness of the generals to the fighting man are remarkable for their candidness. The only failure of the book I find to be the maps... in many places they are missing the place names he refers to... and some have no scale...All in all a great read for those who want to understand the WHY and not the HOW.
3,"Readable, insightful","I love John Keegan, but I strongly believe that the most powerful portrayals of warfare are found in great novels like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, THE BRIDGES OF TOKO-RI, or the new novel about the Second World War, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. Historians, even ones as gifted and talented as John Keegan, are hard pressed to hold the reader's interest, and The First World War suffers from the weakness of simply presenting facts. Keegan can make even the dullest facts come to life, stand up, and salute, if he puts his mind to it, but his heart apparently wasn't in this one all the way through."
2,Not Barbara Tuchmann,"This book covers a byzantine topic (origins and conduct of WWI) which is not assisted at all by the convoluted and run-on sentence structure which the author adheres to. The result is very confusing for the reader. In addition, town names are thrown about like one is very familiar with local French/Russian/Polish geography, frequently with no reference to maps. Something is moreover definitely lacking in the time-line presentation, because battles for example are very difficult to follow. I will definitely stay with The Guns of August."
3,Where's the maps?,"This is a history of battles of WWI. The author does a great job of setting the stage for military battles in WWI. However, I found the maps very inadequate. It was maddening trying to understand the battles that were being descibed when key places did not show up on the few maps that were presented. A book such a well written book deserved to have more maps depicting where the action was taking place."
4,The First World War,"Very interesting detailed book. Very readable. I am English so many of the cities, characters and countries are familiar either trhorugh schooling or travel. Would recommend the book to anyone who wants to understand more about 'the war to end all wars'."
4,Great overall history suffers from unapproachable prose,"I bought this book from a largescale bookseller recently. While it seems a very good and complete history of World War One which I had set out to find, it suffers from some very unapprochable prose and a writing style which, especially for non-British readers, means almost every sentence needs to be deciphered. Take for instance the phrase:""The happenings set in motion by a particular scheme of action will rarely be those narrowly intended, are intrinsically unpredictable and will ramify far beyond the anticipation of the instigator.""I can think of at least half a dozen ways this phrase could have been said more simply and without loosing the meaning. Albeight, the loaded literary language does nail down the meaning. There can be no mistaking what is meant by 'instigator.' However, after a dozen or so pages into the book and almost every sentence is as 'loaded' as this one, it starts to seem like purple prose."
4,Great history about the great war,One of the best overall books on The Great War. Keegan is world renown for his military analysis and contributions to research of the World Wars. Must read for any World War One enthusiast.
4,Excellent and Well Written Account of WWI,Once again John Keegan has produced another well written and researched book to add to his growing number of titles. This is an excellent one volume account of the Great War which the novice or experienced reader will enjoy. I found the first few chapters a bit dry but once the author moved into the sections covering the fighting the book moved along smartly.The author covers all theatres of the war and covered those naval and aviation aspects that had bearing on the war as a whole. There were a number of excellent general maps and numerous black & white photographs to assist the reader to follow the narrative.Overall a great book to read and well worth the time to sit down and enjoy.
3,good movie for us baby boomers,Not jack nicholson's best movie but it's OK. If you are not over 40 you probably won't like this flick.
3,A stretch....,"This movie was a stretch - particularly challenging for people who don't work for something they believe in, or just simply exist in this world until they die. Jack Nicholson is spectaculor in his role as the even keeled mundane Warren Schmidt. You keep wanting this movie to have some bizzare exciting twist, but it stays true to form and has a good solid message - do something with your life that you believe in and you will be much better off. Don't just exist to live - live to exist! Good work on this movie. Joseph Dworak"
5,About a sad and lonely man,"That's the way it is for many modern men in Warren Schmidt's position. He has just retired, his wife has died, and he finds himself lonely and not knowing what to do with himself or what his life has meant. Warren has a daughter he dotes on and she's about to marry a nice but goofy guy, so he travels to Denver in a Winnebago, having some adventures along the way. What holds this all together is his frequent letters to Ndugu, a small boy in Africa whom Warren has taken on as a foster child via ChildReach. And it's Ndugu's response which finally gives Warren a reason to go on living, at the very end.Often sad, sometimes funny."
3,It could have been better.,"Wow. I don't even know where to start. Jack is one of my all time favorite actors. He was great in ""As Good As It Gets,"" ""Batman,"" ""One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest,"" and many others...and suddenly, he embarked upon this.A total waste of his acting abilities.""About Schmidt"" fails to please. I was unprepared for the hippie version of Kathy Bates after her dynamic performance as the mastermind killer/lunatic in ""Misery."" However, since she is such a versatile actor and quite good at what she does, I can't say it was all that bad. I think I could have gone without the hot tub scene; it seemed irrelevant to the storyline.The movie is saved by the cynicism that we all love and enjoy about Jack. It's good for a few laughs, but nothing else beyond that."
5,About As Good As It Gets,"This is nothing short of a really great movie, easily the best movie of 2002. It is wise, poignant, funny, memorable. For baby-boomers over age 50, you leave the theater as touched as you were after first seeing ""The Graduate"". Kathy Bates is marvelous. The whole cast shined. And, of course, Jack Nicholson finally realized his ""highest acting self"" here, after years of giving us glimpses.It is a near perfect a movie as one could imagine. It's only imperfection was that, although it was a rather long movie, it was still too short. I didn't want to leave ""About Schmidt""'s wondrous universe so soon.Obviously, I loved it! (And the nation's critics loved it, a group with whom I'm often not in agreement).I'm wondering if there will be a dirctor's cut."
3,Sad comedy,"Much of the problem of this movie could have been solved by getting a good housekeeper.The rest of the decisions was made with the help of Jack Nicholson' check book and he could have simply closed it.I know , I would have......"
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This movie is vastly different from the book. The only part similar is the very beginning, the rest doesn't relate to the novel at all. It's incredibly boring, it starts off sad, ends even worse. Incredibly depressing, would never watch again nor ever recommend."
1,About nothing!,"This movie is the worst Nicholson movie ever. It tries to be a comedy but there are no punch lines. It tries to make a statement about the futility of growing old, but fails there also. The director himself admits he was not sure what he wanted to say in the movie (see extras). He wanted to say something about growing old. He would have been much better off trying to make a comedy or a drama instead of attempting to blend both into one. This movie fails completely on all levels. It is not worth seeing for any reason."
2,Nothing new,"Hearing all the buzz about this movie, I went into it expecting something original. But it seems like they made the movie specifically for Oscar buzz. I know, it's based on a book that I haven't read, so I can't comment on that, but the movie brings forth no interesting points. There's nothing for me to chew on at the end of the movie, because I've seen it all before. Yes, the unexamined life is not worth living. I know this, you can at least present it to me in an interesting way. We just go through the motions of Schmidt's life and what eats at him. He hates that he's old. He doesn't know how to deal with his wife's death, or take care of himself after she's gone. He has a broken relationship with his daughter. All these things were presented with poignant music, expecting me to feel for him. But I don't. He's bland, the story is bland, and nothing was interesting. You might like it if you haven't seen many movies, but I've seen this story done before."
1,The Most Boring Peice of S**t Ever Made,"I will regret wasting those two hours viewing this movie my entire life. Never see this movie, no more said. It has no plot whatsoever and there's nothing funny in it at all."
1,Literally painful to sit through,"Another example of a movie that received praise from elitist ""critics"" (I'm using that term loosely), despite the fact that it is terrible. It's boring. It goes nowhere. Nothing really happens. It's like watching ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" all over again, which was another example of a terrible movie loved by critics."
1,About Schit,"National Treasure, yadda, yadda, yadda - Emotional wallop, blah, blah, blah. I'm one of those movie fans who likes to enjoy a movie. You know, good old-fashioned escapist stuff. I don't need explosions, spaceships, or bare bodies; just a great story. I'm just like most of you out there, not some art-house poser or wanna-be critic, but when this was put on my recommendation list I had to do something. STAY AWAY - FAR, FAR AWAY! This movie will suck the life out of you. When Kathy Bates naked in a hot tub is the best part, you know there is a MAJOR problem. So if you are one of the unwashed masses (like me), leave this one for the ""sophisticates"" and go grab ""Parenthood"" or ""The Quiet Man"" or ""Dan In Real Life"" for some ENTERTAINING grown-up emotional wallop. Remember: Life's too short to waste it on bad movies!"
1,Boring as hell,"I found this movie to be boring. It seemed to drip on an on without much a plot line at all. Follows the life of a dull, depressed man, to whom nothing really interesting ever happens. I would only recommend this to people that enjoy movies that are dull, depressing and where nothing really happens."
1,I Don't Want to Know Schmidt,I went to this movie because I love Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson. It's a slow moving depressing movie. I have NO idea what the academy was thinking when they nominated those two for Oscars for this film. Kathy Bates gets one for going naked and Jack Nicholson gets one for crying? If you have to see this film wait and rent it don't waste your money.
1,Should be skipped,"I purchased this DVD after reading favorible reviews and was very disappointed.I am a big Jack Nicholson fan but this is one movie he should not have made.It began on a low level plane and went downhill. It was depressingly boring and a waste of time.Jack plays a character who retires and goes on an odyssey not worth watching. It is sad to get ripped off by a piece of trash like this, but you open the DVD, no refunds. My only resourse is to warn others not to repeat my mistake."
4,"very good, a good look at how hum drum things can get","not an uplifting film, so rent it when you are ready for a kind of ""grey"" filmnicholson is good at portraying this atmosphere, a couple of good twist and turns, and excellent story line"
4,Not Really a comedy,I would not label this movie as a comedy if you are looking for a good laugh this is not really recomended for you but if you like Jack then go for the movie it is very good It is about a newly retired mand Warren Schmidt and what he is going through in retirement and his daughter who he doesnt have a strong relationship with is about to get married to someone he doesnt think is good enough for her this is really a more touching and sad film more than a comedyI would recomend buying it for only about a buck on amazon instead of renting it which will cost you probably like 6 bucks
1,What A Turkey Of A Movie ...,"Despicable, disgusting, and depressing ... one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. What was Mr. Nicholson smoking when he accepted the title role in this movie?"
1,I CAN PEE ON THE FLOOR!!! ahhhh life...,"Pity party extraordinaire, has his health, money, freedom, and Ngudu... Why writing that big fat $22.00 check and the life tome to a charity is funny reaches escape velocity faster than averting eyes in a jacuzzi scene... Props to at least addressing the New Life issues at 65+ but never touches topics that truly need insight, fake speech at wedding sez it all, flatlined.... Can;t believe there was an Oscar nod for this performance, oh yeah! forgot that hilarity ensues with that topotheline waterbed scene... Thanks Jack for the many pleasurable moments derived from ANY of your other films but had to vent on this choice. Apologies..."
1,Jack Nicholson took this role? What a shame.,"Many of Jack's movies have a little humor, action, and somewhat of a plot. After the first hour of watching this story of a lonely man who corresponds with a mail-order sponsor child, I began falling asleep. I have never seen a movie more boring and plotless. However I gave the movie a chance, dragging for over 2 hours, which ended in bitter sorrow. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. If you like slow and depressing movies, this one is for you. Sorry Mr. Nicholson, stick with action and real comedy movies."
1,Where have you gone Jack Nicholson?,"I am a consumate Nicholson fan, but this offering defies description. It is so slow, so inane, so boring, that it's painful to watch. Neither my wife nor I could finish it. Nicholson was a staple in our household, now we'll wait till his new films show up on the movie channels, and then make a decision regarding purchase."
1,Another Hollywood Bomb!,"The Producers of this movie advertise the most humorous scenes, which MAY total 30 minutes, TOPS, and call it a Comedy??? This, and the Actors were my reason for watching it....and waiting... and hoping for some relief from this agonizingly boring 2+ hours. If you can't depend on Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates to make you laugh, who can you depend on?....What a colossal waste of time! Don't even Bother!"
1,"Very, very bad-not worth anyone's time","This movie is extremely bad-a complete waste of time. I think Jack is great, but this movie is horrible and is not at all related to the book."
2,Was this movie SUPPOSED to be funny?,"This film was not displeasing, but I found it more pathetic than anything else, poor Schmidt! His pitiful attempts at getting on alone, making passes at his his new found acquaintance's wife, etc. are just sad to watch. The daughter is pathetic too, in her choice of a to-be-husband and his oh-so-interesting family, although Bates was really the only funny thing about this movie.I felt for Schmidt, his emptiness, loneliness, wandering and ultimately feeling like a total failure except for his one small but important contribution to the world. Overall, not really a bad movie but passing it off as a comedy as is often done, is totally off...Two stars, one each for Nicholson and Bates. They were, as usual, great."
4,Jack Done Good,"I've never cared much for Jack Nicholson. I thought he played the same character in every movie. Not so this one. This movie is sweet, touching, funny, sad, depressing, and thought-provoking. The movie was filmed mainly in Nebraska and as a resident of Omaha for 26 years, I can tell you Hollywood did a pretty good job of getting it right. I don't think either coast will ever get over the stigma of seeing us Midwesterners as hicks and simpletons, but I can't complain about this movie because I enjoyed it too much. The story is about a man who retires after several years at an insurance company, loses his sense of worth and has no idea what to do with himself. This subject doesn't get talked about much probably because it is mainly a ""male issue"". This phenomenon deserves awareness and understanding and that's why this film is a gift. Sometimes good movies are better than a therapist."
2,For Your Consideration,"I don't like that the movie has the words ""For Your Consideration"" at the bottom of the screen for much of the movie. You should have mentioned this in your description."
2,Like watching paint dry,"I rented this with a friend of mine after hearing positive reviews. I would like to take this opportunity to warn others that, in spite of the positive things you may have heard, this movie is not good. Sure, there are a few minor chuckles here and there, but these don't even come close to making up for the slow pace of this movie and the dreary, dull plot (if you want to call it a plot).This is a movie that meanders on and on. This wouldn't be so bad if it was leading up to something, some kind of climax, but that isn't the case. When this movie ended it was both a disappointment and a relief!The two stars are for Nicholson doing the best he could with this pointless, wearying, slug of a movie."
5,Drama?...About Schmidt Is One Of 2002's Best Comedies!,"Jack Nicholson is one of America's favorite actors, and I can't think of any other role that could have suited him better then Warren Schmidt. It seems that throughout the movie, Jack doesn't even have to try that hard to make his character believable. He is just simply that good. Plus, don't even get me started about how excellent Kathy Bates was in this! These two talents combined made a decent script spirng alive into the realms of greatness.However, the hugest suprise of this movie to me was that it was advertised as a drama. When I actually saw the movie, and thought about it, I think I laughed more during About Schmidt then most any other movie that year. Once the script takes off, it doesn't stop until the finish!I really enjoyed this movie overall. Wonderful acting combined to a nice script gave About Schmidt a big boost. This is a fun, meaningful movie."
4,"Pretty Good Movie, But Kinda Sad","About Schmidt delivers some good messages about life, and is often very funny. Jack Nicholson is a very good actor. He can go from liberator of mental patients in ""One Flew Over the Cuccoo's Nest"" to homicidal maniac attempting to murder his family with an axe in ""The Shining"" to clean freak in ""As Good as It Gets"" to an old retired man who is searching for meaning in life in this movie. Kathy Bates also does a good job in her somewhat minor role and is quite funny (she still scares me a little when I think of her role in ""Misery""). Those are some of the pros. Some cons are that the movie doesn't really flow, story-wise. It doesn't have a real storyline. Jack Nicholson's character kinda goes around aimlessly in a search for the meaning of life, and doesn't quite find it. And, I think something about this movie may have left me feeling a little depressed. Still, it is all in all a good film that I recommend to fans of Jack Nicholson."
4,BEST ENDING OF A FILM EVER,I wont spoil the ending but while many people may say its depressing I think it is one of the most poetic and open endings I have seen since Raging Bull
3,Jack is good but the movie is not,I have always enjoyed the acting of Jack Nicholson however this is the first movie he has done that was not up to his normal mark. I was let down and overall felt this was not a good investment. Jack was back in style with Anger Management and did outstandingly well.
1,"God, what a depressing movie","What a depressing and movie. I kept watching it hoping that at some pivotal point in the movie Schmidt would have some revelation and find some purpose. Well it kind of comes at the very end but is still real lame with the reading of a letter from a Sister at his sponsored childs home. The movie drags on for over 2 hours showing a depressing man leading a boring, depressing life. There is no character development, and at the end of the movie you wondered what the purpose of the whole film was. I can never decide if it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. The few funny moments are overshadowed by the dark and depressing tone of the whole movie."
1,About Sh&t.....,"After watching this all I could think to myself is ""now I'm two hours older""...what a waste of time.Enter ""Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" in the search box if you want a Nicholson movie to laugh, cry and reflect upon."
1,Do NOT WASTE your time,"This has got to be Jack Nicholson's worst movie ever. The story is unbelievably boring, depressing and lifeless. Other than the movie ""She's So Lovely"" this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I only watched it through to the end because I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't!The best scene in the movie involves Kathy Bates naked in a hot tub. That says it all.Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!"
1,commercial for ChildReach,"This movie was very boring and depressing. In the end it turned out to be a 2 hour long commercial for ChildReach, which is like Save the Children. There is even literature for ChildReach in the DVD case. The hottub scene was not as daring or fun as reported. Avoid this at all costs."
3,"More like ""About Speeches""","It seemed like every 5 minutes somebody was making a toast in this movie. I finally realized it was to hammer in the point that ""About Schmidt"" is really about communication, or lack of. Jack's character can't communicate with his wife or daughter, nor can they with him. The only people Jack can communicate with are either people he's never met (Ndugu, the child he is sponsoring overseas) or people he hardly knows (the couple he meets while trekking out to see his daughter). This makes for a few funny moments, but I hardly think this is one of Nicholson's best. If you enjoyed ""As Good as it Gets"" you'll enjoy this. If you didn't, don't waste your time."
1,Waste of their talent and my time,"I guess to just come out and yell THIS MOVIE SUCKED BIG TIME would be rude.Hmmmm.... (She is desperately trying to find something nice to say about this total waste of film.) Ok. At least we have two great actors in Nicholson and Bates who were obviously suckered, blackmailed, or otherwised talked into doing a really boring movie. Nothing was a surprise, you didn't like Nicholson's character, and quite honestly, who cared if he decided to put us and his movie family our of our respective miserys by running the RV over the nearest bridge.The critics loved this movie and I haven't a clue why. BORING BORING BORING is about all I can say about it.Anything Nicholson and Bates have done is better than this stinker. Borrow or rent them instead."
1,A Real Downer,"I think this was one of the most depressing movies ever made. I saw it with my (senior citizen) husband and 23 year old granddaughter and we ALL came away feeling depressed in general and somewhat puzzled as to the meaning of the last sad scene. Jack Nicholson, as usual, gave a great performance, but things just dragged on and on until the bitter end."
5,ABOUT JACK,"Put Warren Schmidt in the upper tier of great Nicholson characters. This is as probing and complex a character study that Jack has taken on in some years and it's a welcomed sight. There are many great moments in this touching and sincere film that others have mistakenly written off as mean spirited. Only Jack can make Schmidt's life contradictions unique... he gawfs at the expense of a housekeeper, makes his wife cash in her stock to pay for half a motor home, yet opens his wallet (and his heart) to an impovershed foster child.From anyone else it would have come off as trivial and forced. Kathy Bates is wonderful in the limited screen time and she has some of the film's best lines. ABOUT SCHMIDT is one of 2003's top films."
5,Wonderful Surprise,"Since other reviews have told the plot, I'm not going to bother...I'm not sure what I was expecting when I sat down to see this movie, but I know I didn't expect it to be quite so good.I had recently lost my father and this movie seemed to hit all the darkly humorous points of losing someone close to you, that most would regard as taboo. At this point in my life, I definitely related, understood, and had seen first-hand some of the outrageous and necessary reactions that come from death (and retirement).Kathy Bates, as always, was phenomenal. Jack Nicholson, great. Dermott Mulroney was grotesquely funny.It's hard to say what exactly makes this movie so wonderful. It's not necessarily a movie based on what is physically going on, but more on emotional reactions and psychological evolution."
2,Below average guy in crisis,"This in't a movie about an average guy who retires and then suffers the loss of his spouse only to find himself grappling with the meaning of his life: it is the story of a very below average guy in that situation. This character was as dull as dirt. Unbelievable, literally. This is for people who are not in touch with average people or who simply want to believe others are dull to feel better about themsleves. Sorry, but is doesn't make it even with the good acting. Just depressing."
2,Jack Nicholson deserves a better script!,"Jack Nicholson is an outstanding actor. His performance in this movie continues to exhibit his great ability. This movie is one of those examples as to how even the best of actors can only do so much with the script he is given.A story should move toward a climax and then finish with a conclusion. This movie just seems to have Jack moving about aimlessly. Although there is the hint of a story line and one might argue a conclusion, the movie just doesn't make the grade. You sit there and keep hoping something will happen to salvage the movie and it doesn't (until the credits are rolling and you get to go home).If you want to see Jack Nicholson then please see ""As good as it gets"" or one of his other great performances in which he had better material to work with.Eight of us saw this movie together and only my wife said that she liked it."
5,Best dark comedy.,"I thought this movie was perfect from the writing to the acting. This dark comedy captured the feeling of loneliness and a life without meaning that you really feel sorry for the character at the last stage of his life. Its not completely dark, the movie has segments where he corresponds with an orphan in Africa which is quite humorous. I think the movie is quite similiar to Bill Murray's character in Lost in Translation. A person lost without direction... seeking understanding and the need to know that they have made a positive difference in someone's life."
5,not a let down by any means,"Worth seeing every timeAlso have it on dvdwatched it twice alreadyJack really pulls out all the punches with his charactermaking us laugh and cry and feel sympathyThe scenes are romantic, touching, interestingand keep you hookedI watched it all the way thruand will watch it over againSuperb actors and actressesgreat roles and cameos tooClever plotReally a touching movieWorth the seeGo rent it :)"
4,Great.,"One of Jack's great movies, this one is a classic. Not focused on fiction this time, the story is very compelling and the comedy is appetizing. This is a must see for satire comedy lovers."
2,Paint your TV and watch it dry instead-it's more interesting,"Okay, repressed guy who missed out on dreams retires into boredom. Wife dies, so guy wants to find meaning of life. May have found it.Took me 20 seconds to summarize the whole plot. Took the movie two hours to do it.Nicely nuanced performance by Nicholson, which is the only reason to even consider this movie. Beyond that, though, this thing is dull, dull, dull. Don't bother unless 1) you're an insatiable wonk about acting techinique, or 2) you're into examining your own navel for any reason other than the discovery of lint.-gvi"
5,A POIGNANT PAINFUL LOOK AT LIFE,"An arrogant, overbearing, crusty, aging man comes to terms with life. He retires, his wife dies, his daughter is getting married, and no- they don't need him to come back as a consultant at the office to help the new ""hotshot"" in charge. Jack Nicholson is superb and we alternately laugh and groan as he comes to grips with all the changes in his existence, and struggles to find his place, his purpose. Kathy Bates is hilarious, and brings new meaning to the concept of ""mischief and the spice of life"". The wedding captures all the emotional lows and highs of the occasion. Most endearing are ""Schmidt's"" letters to his foster child, Ndugo, a continent away. This child, with one little crayon drawing, achieves what no-one else could. Poignant, painful, yet funny. Outstanding cast."
4,"Jack, Jack, Jack!","Will this be an Oscar No. 4 for Mr. Nicholson? He surely deserves it. One of his finest performances to date. For those who expect him to be Jack as in most of his films, this is not one of them. But it definitely showcases his talents and versatility as an actor.This movie is about the transitions during second half of life: regrets, loneliness, uncertainty. Looking back and wondering what if. It revolves around Jack's character.Overall, a great movie. All through the laughter and sadness filmmakers stayed true to the subject. And throughout the emotional rollercoster you still manage to pick up on hints of hope and meaning at the end.Definitely worth watching."
2,Nicholson must be desperate for money to make this film,This movie was so facinatingly boring that I had to watch it to the end to see what would *not* happen! bleh!
2,"Simply put, boring.","Of course, opinions are relative to the persons offering them and unless you're familiar with that person...well, you understand. I'm a Nicholson fan, I'm a guy and I'll never see my twenties again unless in another life. The only reason I would consider for the making of a movie such as this is to entertain those who get excited over watching characters out of touch with reality; people who've gotten close to the end without ever having had a novel thought or who simply never stopped to figure what it might be all about. Personally I view movies for the sake of being entertained, taken from common place events to bigger than life happenings. Honestly, I couldn't wait for this movie to end and only stayed with it because I was so sure Nicholson wouldn't have bothered with such tripe. Yech! Not only didn't I get it but I haven't a clue who would want to."
2,Yow!,"I watched this dvd while wearing ""Pampers"" training pants, just to be safe. They didn't help.However... I'll give ""About Schmidt"" two stars, because anything's better than watching that *sshole Steve Martin.Yes, I am over the age of 13.Thank You"
1,@b0Ut Sh!T,"not funny. had a naked old lady in it. no plot. made me wanna puke. so, this movie definately deserves the title ""worst movie ever"""
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the most boring, pathetic excuse for a movie I've ever seen in my life. It's a total rip-off. How dare they expect people to pay money for this? Do yourself a favor and save your money - you can be more entertained by staring a blank screen."
3,As Glum as it Gets,"Seldom can a poor old stiff have been more savagely skewered than Mr Schmidt in this, to my mind, pointless film. Anyone who thinks it is funny has a funny sense of humour. So far as I could see, Schmidt is a dull, unimaginative, steady sort of type, who lacks vigour, has never done anything wrong, has worked in a tedious job to support his equally dull wife and pasty-faced daughter, and is rewarded by being made an object of mockery and derision. Actually, the story is really rather nasty and supercilious. Let us puncture the bourgeois, and have a good laugh as he disintegrates. The three stars are for Jack Nicholson, who is definitely a very good actor. He is also courageous, but I can't help thinking that here he would have done better to flee this role."
3,Is life really this sad?,"For those who are looking for a comedy along the lines of ""As Good as it Gets"", this movie will be a big disappointment. The advertisements predict a comedy but this is really a pragmatic look at getting old. The audience laughed in a effort to get relief from the sadness the characters were experiencing.Jack Nicholson is, in deed, very good. Kathy Bates' role is very limited. The movie does leave you hoping that your old age will be better than that of the characters."
5,"Dear Ndugu,","I gotta say this has been quite a movie. Very funny and at the same time, sad. You have gotta watch this one."
1,Horrific waste of time,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. And I sat thru AI (Arificial Intelligence). I never thought it could get worse than AI. It was so slow and dumb I was embarassed to be watching it. The ending just all of a sudden happened, thankfully."
1,Horrible,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. After I saw it I looked at my friend and said I want my 2 hours back. This movie is a wast of time. Its about some guy and his pathetic life. DONT BUY IT!!
2,Watch something else,"While it Jack does pull the part of pretty well, the movie was not funny. It was not more than 30 minutes in, when I started checking the time that was left."
1,As Bad As It Gets!,"About Schmidtt is a horrible boring movie about a retired widower who tries to prevent his spoiled brat daughter from marrying a lazy stupid loser with a wacko family and ruining her life but his daughter gets mad at him that's basically the whole movie. One thing I remember in this movie that really sticks out is that before his wife passed she told him that she thought their daughter was too spoiled and he need to stop sending her money and thing but he didn't listen to her so I guess it was kind of his fault that their daughter turned out to be a spoiled brat. What were Jack and Kathy thinking of when they agreed to do this movie? If you want to see good Jack Nicholson movies watch As Good As It Gets, Somethings Gotta Give, The Shining and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and if you want to see some good Kathy Bates movies watch Mysery, Deloris Claibourne, Fried Green Tomatoes and Annie!"
1,"Jack's acting is wonderful, but the movie is not","First of all, let me start by saying that Jack Nicholson gave a wonderful, Oscar-worthy performance in this movie. Unfortunately, I did not like the movie, in spite of his acting. It's a movie about a midlife crisis, which starts with the main character's retirement and the death of his spouse, and ends with him in tears when he realizes that his life has mattered to one person (who he's never met, which is why it doesn't work for me). There's a lot of equally depressing scenes in between. I had expected this movie to be somewhat humorous and uplifting, but it was just depressing. So I'd give five stars to Jack Nicholson for his acting, but only one star to this movie."
1,Hollywood hype out of respect,"I have seen hundreds of movies in my life, and this one is the absolute worst. No disrespect meant to the actors, but I describe it best as a modern day dramatization of Death of a Salesman. I would equate the action level with that of watching grass grow."
3,Another reviewer hit it on the head...,"This is a superb character study of Warren Schmidt, but after that, it kind of flails around a little bit. Nicholson and Bates are excellent here; the others also good, but good performances alone can't hold a film completely together. While there definitely are some comedic moments here (check the extras as well), don't get this expecting a comedy; it's actually a little depressing and not really a ""feel-good"" film. Seems like the screenplay could've gone a little deeper in spots, shallower in others. I'd give it a 7 out of 10, one point for the acting alone."
2,One of the Most Depressing Movies I have Ever seen,Made me want to jump off a bridge 30 mins into it. Had some funny lines by Jack but otherwise was just a depressing movie that wasnt that good.
2,This is not Tipsy the quirky electronica genius,"If you are looking for albums by Tipsy the talented electronica/dance artist, this is not him!"
4,A useful book,This book is probably the most authoritative book I have read on Victorian arcitecture in India.
1,"Item is great, Product description is deceiving!","Ordered this for school the listing shows 12 per box, but you are only getting ONE ROLL, not a whole box, I would not have used the money out of my school budget if I had known. Its a Great Product but they need take out the 12 per box, completely take it out of your listing it is absolutely deceiving."
4,great product,"just what i needed ,been looking for this for a while ,works great for post surgery covering ,doesn't tear up skin even with repeated use."
5,"I loved this. It has a ""How Green Was My Valley"" feeling.","This was Mary's first book set in Wales. I loved it very much. This one has the feeling of ""How Green Was My Valley"". I enjoyed her discuss- ion of Chartism, and early unions in Great Britain"
2,Photos somewhat deceptive,"My 2.5 year old daughter loves magnets and blocks, so I thought this would be a winner. It was a little pricey, but I figured it would be worth it. The toy is advertised as having strong magnets for building, and the photos show vertical constructions. But we found the magnets are not strong enough to build even the simplest vertical structure, such as the cube pictured in the advertisement. The only thing we could get to stay up was a pyramid. Anything else collapses. I tried a couple of different ways to construct the cube, even trying to construct the ""walls"" on the ground and lifting them up (like they do for houses!) but no luck. My kids made shapes flat on the floor and played with them, and rolled the balls around. But there is no way to use this product as it is advertised."
4,Toy good magnet weak,The toy is safe and fun but the magnets need to be a little stronger to make the shapes shown on the box. My child puts them in mouth and they are safe and durable. Over all they are pretty good. I would just recommend they make the magnet stronger.
5,"Patriot Hosta 4"" pot","I just want to take this time say thank you, This is one beautiful plant it's growing excellent thank guys great service specialy shipping . Wish I could post a picture to show how its growing."
5,The best for the price!!,Great fit and great ride. I have purchased several sets of KYB for different vehicles and they never disappoint. If you Autox you know these can't be beat for the performance and quality for the price.
1,misnomer - does not work with nokia 3650,this does not work with nokia 3650 as stated in title. I called Plantronics customer support and they said my 80$ plantronics m1000 does not work with nokia 3650 as they are of different bluetooth preferences.
1,"No funciona con Nokia 3650, demasido tarde para mis US $80","En la publicidad dice que es compatible con Nokia 3650, pero la verdad que luego de mucho averiguar estos no son compatibles...que horror...lo que sucede es que M1000 es compatible con ""headset Bluetooth profile"" y el 3650 tiene ""handsfree Bluetooth profile"" y eso es suficiente para no ser compatibles...luego de luchar 10 meses me encontre con esta sorpresa...y yo que pensaba que algo malo estaba haciendo...Angelretamaleslatrille@hotmail.com"
5,It's hard to find,"This album is a real good one if you like the electronic music including several Dj's of the size of Paul Van Dyk, this electronic music is easy to listen and understand.This soundtrack is a really hard one to find, a lot of stores are going to tell you that doesn't exists.The movie is not a good one, it's very silly and intracendent, but well there are people for everything and I respect them, this is only my opinion."
2,Does not fit Kenwood UBZ-LH14,"The product seems to be well made, but is designed for the Kenwood Freetalk ""e"" and does not fit any of the Kenwood radios sold on Amazon. You can force it onto the UBZ-LH14, but it was made for a radio with a fixed antennae on the right hand side and buttons in different positions. Now that I have it, I may keep it because I need some protection for the radio. If I had known that it didn't fit I would have tried something else. Unfortunately Bodyglove does not make a case for the UBZ-LH14."
2,Menu-less,"This dvd has no scene menu. When player returns to the beginning of the dvd after a lengthy pause, navigating to find your place is worse than old vhs tapes with no counters."
3,"not O'Brien's best, but great nonetheless","A fascinating look at the complex relationship between two brothers, one of whom fought in Vietnam, Northern Lights also examines other issues. I enjoyed this book a lot, but O'Brien's other works are better. After all, this *was* his first published novel. In fact, O'Brien himself has said that he wishes he should have made intense revisions to this book. Regardless, read Northern Lights only after you have read O'Brien's other books. I am a true O'Brien fan who has read ALL of his books, and I DID enjoy this book. But save it for after you have learned to appreciate O'Brien and his literary style."
4,Good debut novel,"Excellent debut novel, but Tim O'Brien only got better. All of his tension and emotion in present in this novel, but he still had yet to develope his style and language that has made him, in my opinion, one of America's best writers today.It's a story about privacy. Private lives at home and secret romances of sorts and the return of a Vietnam vet who has a constant reminder of his time In Country, but he never tells the secret of how he received the injury to his ear.It's an excellent debut novel, but don't be discouraged if this is the first Tim O'Brien novel you read, he only get's better. I give it my highest recommendation.It's adventurous and tense when the brothers are lost in the woods. O'Brien paints an impressive picture of the Minnesota woods when these brothers travel at the feet of these enormous snow covered trees in awe and reverence of nature."
1,Boring,"I selected this book because of the author, however this proved to be a story with no plot. A tedious read."
3,Oh. So that's it?,"Interesting book in that it was both hard to pick up at times and hard to put down at others. I felt it was somewhat long and slow moving while at the same time the writing was, in my opinion, excellent. How can that be? The dialogue was written so well I could hear my spouse, brother or friend saying the same thing. I ""felt"" the blizzard (based years of camping with the scouts), but the problem I had is that the end of the book came and I didn't really understand where it left me."
3,"Historically interesting, but rather boring in style","The Tudor era is one of my special interests, and, with Reginald Pole being a character I find particularly fascinating, I'd hoped to love this book. Though it is historically accurate, and provides points of view which are quite enriching to a broad picture of the time, I found the style of writing and plot to be rather boring."
4,"little small, but comfortable","It's a nice little padded cushion. No complaints, except it's a little on the small side.I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again for the low price, and the size is livable."
4,Replacement,"This was a replacement for the ear cushion on my Plantronics M170 headset. It fit perfectly. The first ear cushion lasted six ears with little use. Hopefully, the replacement will last longer."
3,"For the Plantronics M170, M175, S10, T10, T20, and CT12 headsets","This replacement ear cushion is for the Plantronics M170, M175, S10, T10, T20, and CT12 headsets. I guess the other reviewer didn't think to do a web search on the part number before purchasing it. I submitted a more descriptive product title to Amazon, so maybe by the time you read this review, this page will be updated.I gave this product three stars because the only reason you need to buy it is because the leatherette will flake off after a few years. The rest of the headset and the cushion will be in excellent condition. So you're effectively force to buy a replacement ear cushion every few years only because Plantronics chose to use leatherette instead of cloth.Also, you only get one ear cushion, because these head sets only have one ear piece."
4,Nice replacement for the price!,I bought these to replace the ear cushion on my CT-14. The leatherette ear cushions are better than foam and easier to clean. The quality is good and I would buy them again.
1,miss represented,These ear cusions are shown in a super size and are actually the size of a half dollar. I asked for replacememnt cushions for a full sized headphone set and this is what I got. I don't understand why they are displayed so large. Rip Off!
1,no es bueno,este producto no es bueno es mas pequeño de lo normal no me gusta y no me funciono como quería
3,Nice one but Not sure if it wise to spend that much on these,"These diapers are excellent and provide all the chem-free goodies. They work well, dont leak and feel good.Though, not a complaint about this product, I am not sure if I should be spending this much on diapers. Unless, I can really afford to make everything toxic chemical free in my house and around my baby, I dont think this is any major value."
1,One star for the good idea that almost worked.,"Got one for my 2003 Golf, so it required an additional interface box. The system actually worked as described, for about half an hour. Got the LCD display, too and it is really really cool, because the factory VW head unit doesn't display the artist & song. However, the control simply does not work. Monster sent an ""updated"" interface, which didn't work either. Somebody should be fired. It's like they decided to ship the product without testing it on a car. Poo-poo to Monster, because this product was exciting. A potential problem is getting a refund after taking so much time installing it and trying to get it to work. I've torn my car apart twice and blown three fuses. It's a total bummer, because this is the only product of it's sort with an optional display."
1,Piece of junk,"For reasons too numerous to mention, this is an awful product that's caused me nothing but frustration. The final straw was when the cable started wearing out and cutting out the right speakers 6 months after install. I've had to disconnect my car battery numerous times to 'reset' this thing. Worst of all is that when you shut the car off, it doesn't remember where you were, so forget about podcasts, audio books etc. with this thing."
3,Yamaha SPM Wall Mount Bracket,"The bracket was easy to install, once I purchased the necessary lag bolts. The bolts did not come with the bracket. Definitely short sighted on their part. ALso, the space to run the wires needs to be larger. I had to bend the opening to get the head of my Fiber optic and sub woofer cables through."
5,A perfect tool.,"An exciting journey in the hematology's universe. A sharp, accurate work over an extremely interesting field of pathology. A must have item."
5,Venice Panorama,"If you have ever been to Venice or contemplate going, this panorama of the Grand Canal is a beautiful reminder or a great advanced organizer."
4,Awesome but one upped by the first one,"there is only so far you can go with comics. Spiderman, The Hulk, The Flash all comics. this one however takes the cake. the only better movie i can think of is the first x-men and that is sayin somethin. check out http://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1719175 for more comic stuff"
5,Great Sequel,X2 was excellent. It was great seeing Wolverine remembering his past. It was great to see the complexities of the characters being developed too. I hope Halle can come back as Storm for X3 and explore Storm's claustrophobia. Can't wait to see Pheonix as well. Who will they add next? The Morlocks? Gambit? Will we see Jubilee's powers? How about Firestar?
2,Good if you like comic books,"A new war between humans and mutants begins after a attempted murder in the White House against the president of the United States. Now, all the mutants need to fight together against an enemy in common: General William Stryker, who is planning to destroy them all. He uses radical methods to get some information from Magneto, and plans an attack to Prof. Xavier's mutant school when there is only Wolverine and the young students. By not seeing the first one, I really had no idea what was going on. The CGI was nicely done but that was about it. I'm not a fan of Sci-fi"
5,X-2 Rules,"X-Men 2 is much much better then the original X-Men. If you liked the 1st X-Men, you would love X-Men 2. This movie is worth buying. When I saw it at the movie theatre, I loved it and I wanted to watch it again and again and again...Hope you like the movie if you plan to see it."
5,one word: WOW!,"Excellent, excellent follow-up of the first movie...more action. I loved BOTH films, but X2 was definitely a bit better. I look forward to the next one!"
1,What a waste.....,"This was as convulted a movie as you can have with four or five stories going on at once. It was treated like a comic book movie, not a real movie. If they wanted to do this right, they would have had a better screenplay and better use of the cast. Not all these effects and plot lines that went no where. TREAT IT LIKE A MOVIE GUYS, NOT A BIG SCREEN COMIC BOOK."
2,Ruined Comic,"For the reviewer who stated that fans of the comic book will like this film, i think your wrong, the movie did the comic no justice, especially towards my favorite character, Wolverine. The story in the movies are almost completely changed from the comic book, i was in utter shock with #1 and #2. Not only does the movie drag on about an hour too long it's just a complete disappointment to hardcore X-Men fans atleast to ones i know. I'm in disbelief at how Wolverine's character was distroyed."
2,WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT,"ok i was excited about this film, i bought tickets early, got to the theature early. I was excited to see night crawler who was the best charecter in this lame movie. He is the reason i gave it a 2 becuase i used to use him as a character in an old xmen game for sega genesis. The reason i gave it a bad rating was becuase it was so boring. I sat their in my seat wishing for more action, but it never came, just constant talking. This had less action than star Trek Nemesis did. It was bad becuase there was no action, not alot of fighting scenes. In total, about 5-10min of fighting seens, the rest is either talking, arguing or flying their ship. I thought it would have more action then the first one, but i was wrong. This movie was truely boring and a waste of my money."
3,"This movie's kinda cool, and weird.","Well, the 2nd X-Men Movie: X2: X-Men United is a good movie, but some horrible looks and voices. Im sorry. Well, this is Nightcrawler's first movie apperance, and I didnt hear him introduce himself as Kurt. And I dont remember seeing Rouge eiher. But I did see Cyclops, but I dont remember what he sounded like. Now, I havent seen any of the old X-Men cartoon episodes, but I might. X-Men Evoultion is da coolest thoh. Well, theres these X-Men who like only appear in this movie, like Iceman. I dont know the other one thoh. Well, theres this mean guy who hates mutants and hypnotizes everyone excpt the X-Men. His name's Stryker. Hmm. And, Magneto and Mystique kinda team up with the X-Men. But, Jean Gray dies! Oh no! Still, it is long, but couldve been better, ecpecially with Wolverine.Cute Quote: [by] - WolverineWell, theyre might have been some better quotes than the bad s word, but I dunno."
4,Only a preview,"I have seen the trainler for this movie, sounds like a horribly exiting film. Even though I'm a girl, i like X - men. I saw my favorite in the preview, Shadow Cat. So this movie will have the new ones from evolution. It's gonna be so cool."
4,"Better then the first, but plot seems lacking","I like this movie, but the plot i don't think was as focused on as other things were. They made the characters and action sequences look like they came out of the comics, very well done on that. Acting is better, more character depth, which was highly needed. Great comedy, which is needed, a little humor calms people down after suspense scenes. This is definitely one of Bryan Singers best. The only problem besides plot, was the speed of the movie, even though a very long movie, scenes move way too fast. The movie is almost at race car speed, especially during action scenes. Overall, very good, definitely one of the best marvel movies, but for X3, plot work would be nice, because if they can keep the formula from this and then add a great plot, X3 will definitely be a classic."
4,a good disc,i got it as part of a 2 dvd set somewhere else its a good copy too bad it isn't a single layer movie if they had done it as a single layer it could have had both discs on one dvd.
3,average,average hookum designed to appeal to a more mature audience. it is violent in parts and logan does his fair share of cutting up people with his claws so maybe not for kids under 12. i like the new character night crawler and it was good to see the bad guys helping the good guys for a change.
3,Cold as Iceman....,"The movie is technically absorbing and, as long as Bryan Singer keeps handling the wheel, he proved once again that the franchise is in good hands.Altough the story plot is good enough, the movie is ""cold"". It lacks emotion, it's something I can't explain properly... Hugh Jackman steals the show once again, but the rest of the cast, while giving very good performances, failed to give ""punch"" to his lines and dialogues. Like I said before, it's a ""cold"" movie."
3,mmmm....,"Well...its a good movie. All the special fx are very well done and they build up the characters well. But it doesnt make the connection between the comics. I mean, most of the people taht watch it wouldve been familiar with the tv show or the comics, so why didnt they go with the original storyline that was so popular??? Jean isnt meant to just miraculously turn into pheonix, and now theres no room for the back story with rogue for her to get her flight and super strength. If its counted as a seperate movie from the comics/show then its fine, but if you want to see the 'real' x-men then maybe buy the original dvds or comics or something..."
2,A little better,"I hated the first movie and gave it one star. This movie got two stars because it had more action and the characters branch out a bit. It still has plenty of plot discrepancies and I'm pissed off that Sabretooth didn't make an appearance. They seemed to have given Lady Deathstrike, who was a human and not a mutant, all his powers along with his storyline.If you want to see a good comic book movie, go rent Blade 1 or 2, Daredevil, the Hulk or Spawn."
5,X2 is the rare hollywood sequel that's better than the first,"X2 is one of hollywoods greatest movie sequels that rivals the first movie in every way. Better story, better acting ,better action scenes, better music, better characters, and better suspense. This is what all sequels should be like. Bryan Singer did a great job with continuing the X-men series with a thrilling second chapter that can be called ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of this trilogy. It keeps gettng better and better, and I only hope that X-men 3 can do the same, and continue the series to an explosive conclusion without director Bryan Singer at the helm. Good luck Matthew Vaugn, and do the very best job that you can to pull it off."
1,Juvenile George,"Bought only to see Hugh Jackman in something other than ""Kate and Leopold"" and he was just fine -- the only good thing in the movie. Otherwise, this is a puerile film for violence addicts with little or no entertainment value. Best for folks under 18 with mentality under 9."
4,X-MEN 2 FILM REVIEW. WE WANT DETROIT,"There are a lot of people waiting for this film and it will deliver, I can't wait to see Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler...the one thing most fans wanted though, was to see the film being made in Detroit. Detroit, Michigan played a good part in the Cartoon, as the Sentinel home base. They need to show 313 City in the X-MEN Movies. After ""8 Mile"", Detroit has reinvented itself as a promotable Filming Location. Why was Bobby (Iceman) from Boston? Why can't he be from Detroit?"
4,X-2 is OK,X-2 its a lot better than the first but some parts or borring but the begining was tight with nitecraller was poofing alround the wihte house. Also when wolverine was fighting ladydeath styke.
2,Wolverine takes over!!,"This movie is just as lame as the first one. Has hardly anything to do with the X Men and a whole lot to do with Wolverine. They should have just called this movie Wolverine 2, because that is all this movie is about. People that think these movies are good know nothing about the comics."
5,X2 Rocks!,"The first X-Men set not only set the stage for more movies, it gave the genral public a nice glimpse of Stan Lee's Mutants.X2 pushes the limits when it comes to screenplay, special effects and storyline.Nightcrawler is a VERY welcome character. And they do a wonderful job of using him throughout the entire movie. The opening scene is perhaps one of the coolest in film of late.Can't wait till X3!!!"
3,X 2- X Men United,"In the world of movies there are little sequels that are good, and very few that are better than the originals. X2 X Men United, surpasses the original definately. The action is more stylized and frequent. The characters develop more. The scenery and locations are more dangerous and exciting, and the plot is more suspensful and edgy. The DVD of this film is full of extras including documentaries, trailers, and commentaries. My question is, will X-3 be even better than X-2? I guess we will find out in 2005."
3,Is Fox messing with us again?,"I loved the movie, but I would wait to buy the DVD.With the first X-Men movie, fox released a nice DVD set. Then three months later they released the Delux edition version. A few years later they released the 1.5 version. After seeing Fox milk the fans for money three times, I'm going to wait at least a year or two before I buy X2 on DVD."
5,The Best Sequel of All Time,"X-MEN 2 is definately a movie to rave about this year. Not only did it have the characters of X-MEN, it introduced newer mutants, such as Nightcrawler, whom I think was ferocious and funny at just the right moments. In the beginning, I had no interest to see X-MEN. Now, a couple years later, I see X2 and I'm blown away by its exciting theme and excellent plot. I didn't think I would be able to follow it, since I didn't see the first. But, surprisingly, I had no trouble and enjoyed it to its last scene. (my favorite part was the beginning, when Nightcrawler almost kills the President! That was hilarious)"
4,Awesome,Awesome!! That's all that can really be said! I am an abot x-men freak & I thought this movie was brillant! Better than the first & I cannot wait until the next installment! The battle between good & evil shall enseuth!
4,MAGNETO GOES BALLISTIC,"When NIGHTCRAWLER makes an entrance, he don't bamf around! Well, I mean he DOES bamf around! You have GOT to see this! Anyway, he wipes out the Secret Service, and attacks the President, who responds by sending the Marines to attack Xavier's school.Unfortunately, most of the main heroes are gone from the school, but they left WOLVERINE in charge. Unfortunate for the Marines, you understand.Every X-Men fan knew that pathetic plastic prison would never hold the great and powerful, mighty MAGNETO! You guessed right, but which side is he on?Near the end, you are distracted by a terrible tragedy. Then the movie ends, and you walk away, when you suddenly remember MAGNETO..."
2,Not that great,"I liked the first X-Men, I thought it had great characters, acting, and direction. But X-Men 2 was just boring. In the first X-Men I really liked the villans, I mean who doesn't like Toad, you actually got cool battles and mutant vs. mutant. In X-Men 2 its weak army men vs. mutants. A bit lopsided. I found the battles boring and uninteresting. The Nightcrawler scene was pretty sweet and the invasion of the mutant school, but other than that the fight scenes were lame(I didn't really enjoy the Deathstrike scene) X-Men 3 looks like its returning to the first ones style. Bad mutants vs. Good mutants.HooRah!"
3,NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!,"With a longer length and bigger budget, I knew ""X-Men 2"" would be better than the first. Turns out, I was wrong. With even less of a story (the story that exists is ....) and a horrible human villain, ""X2"" is all bangs and no drama. Action and effects make up for little. The Comics-to-Film formula is draining, as is evident of this mishmash. Grade: C"
1,"BAMF YOUR WAY TO HADES, NIGHTCRAWLER!","I give this movie one star for the sheer, laughable entertainment value of Nightcrawler, the blue catholic demon with a tail. He is by far one of the most ridiculous characters I've ever seen! Do not not waste your money or your time on this DVD."
1,Troma would've done a better job,"I am being generous with this 1 star. That's merely for the special effects and good opening scene.However, after that it all boils down to almost 2 hours of boredom. The action is bland and all has been done before. The acting and script, if you can call it that, is so plain and painfull. The talent that is there is completely wasted on this follow up.Troma studios would've done a better job than this.Not worth buying, only viewable if you are completely and utterly bored and there is nothing left on the shelves of your local video store."
2,"Long and slow, with a few good moments","I thought X-Men #1 was the best of the comic book movies but X2 lacks the pacing, suspense and drama of the first, so it seems to go on forever. Add the...German character and all that's left is the wonderful exchanges between Patrick Stewart and a the truly wonderful Ian McKinnon. I could watch those two play chess for 2 hours but the others are a yawn. Femke does look almost exactly like a young Stephanie Powers which is interesting."
1,steve,"This movie was a joke. Talk about silly. It was way overdone, and if I have to see one more mutant either passing through a wall, or crawling on the floor, I will puke. I'm sorry, I just found myself in a state of boredom, and felt that the only strong part in the film was Wolverine and his ""attitude."" Don't wste your time unless you are a real comic fan."
3,Misleading title,"The title is bit misleading, some people may think the two x-men movies are included in the packet, when only the second movie is available."
2,Special effects cover a bad sermon,"I know it's just a movie, but I am fairly allergic to being preached at. So here's the message: even if the human race is faced with a large and growing population of genetically superior humanoids, it's nasty and bad to think ill of them or be afraid that they might someday erase and replace you, because that would be, well,like, discrimination and bigotry. And they seem really nice, most of them, just misunderstood and feared by mean human people.And why are there no Neanderthals left? As the Great White Father in Washington said to the Indians, ""Trust us, we are your friends."" Even watching Hugh Jackman and Jean-Luc Picard could not disguise the earnest silliness of the sermon. Talk about science fiction!"
5,Excellent condition - Like new!,I was amazed how fast this DVD arrived. I was also in shock at what perfect condition it was in. There were no markings or scratches at all! Thank You!
4,"Very entertaining, but inconsistent with comic","I very much enjoyed this movie. The action and character development was well done, but there were a number of incidents that were not consistent with the comic book characters. But to see your favorite X-men characters come to life, it is terrific. There are some other well-placed, if not hidden, references to characters that may be to come (hopefully Gambit)"
4,Wonderful,"If you loved comic books as a kid, science fiction or action movies, this is a great film. Of course, Hugh Jackman is the best. Highly entertaining!"
4,Better than the first!,"The second time around can be better, and in this case, it was! Just superb all around, and if you liked X-Men, you will like X2! The storyline was strong, the cast remained the same and brought more to their roles this time.One minor complaint: please give Halle something to sink her teeth into! Give a bigger nod to the comic fans with Storm!"
4,Good Movie,"This movie was better than the first one, this had more action, more on the edge of you seat , a ggod movie, i hope another is one the way."
5,One of the first comic films to get it right,"Although I was very hesitant about a Bryan Singer-directed version of X-Men, this series is the first comic adaptation since Batman to be truely faithful to the comics. And the great thing is that it makes for an excellent movie. As with Aliens and Godfather 2, the sequel is just as good, if not better than the original. Wolverine's background is explored and the film endsw with an incredible climatic battle scene.Since I don't own the DVD yet, I can only speak for the quality of the film. But if X-Men 1.5 and the list of extra features is any indication, the DVD looks like an excellent product."
5,Cameos,"Gambit wasn't really a cameo, it was just his name on a list of mutants.Scene: Mystique enters Yuriko's office, looking up Erik (Magneto) on the computer, right above his name on the list she accesses, the name Remy LaBeau (Gambit), is seen.Beast was in his human form on a newscast.Scene: Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) in her natural self, is at the bar. On the TV, you can see after showing the mutant riots, a interview with Hank McCoy (Beast).Then the actual appearences by Colossus, Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat), and Siryn. Jubilee actually had a scene in this one, but it was not added to the final cut, but can be seen on the DVD as a deleted scene."
5,Love the X-Men Series,"Loved watching X-Men movies ever since I saw them when they first came out. I own all of them except the 2nd one, so I rented it off of Amazon, which was cheap and convenient."
5,X2-Xmen united-blue ray,"I love the X-men movies,can they be impoved, you bet-blue ray,wow everything looks better. I just traded up on my X-men movies to blue- ray. I am glad I did. The first three. I bought, the fouth one straight out on blue-ray. The last one X-class kind of disapointed me, but that's another review. For favorite movies stick with blue-ray."
4,X2-review,"A steamroller of a movie that really just doesn't let up. A nice balance of storytelling, special effects, and acting. It keeps you interested from the beginning to the end and it won't disappoint you. A movie I can watch again and again. Picture and sound were excellent."
4,Can't wait until X-men 3!,"I thought that this was a great movie, but I don't want to talk about the movie a whole lot. The visual affects in this movie were great and the acting was awesome. This movie should hopefully throughout the weeks beat the rather dumb Marvel comic Daredevil in the box-office. This classic Marvel comic X-men had a better plot and it had some really cool characters. The best actors in a comic book movie ever so far! Huge Jackman, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Rebecca R. Stamos, Brian Cox, and many more great actors. I don't want to give the ending away or accually any of it away. It was an awesome movie and even Erbert and Roeper both gave it thumbs up! I would say don't even wait until video, go see it in theaters!"
5,X-Men 2: X-Men is the Best,"The new X-Men movie was so awesome! It deserves 5 stars and could almost beat Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in the greatest movies!The movie begins where the last one left off...Magneto in his plastic prison and Professor Xavier at the school of mutants. But this time, a mutant-hater named William Stryker is arranging attacks to prove that we should kill mutants, and this heats both Magneto and Xavier up. So what do they do? They join forces and fight with the other X-Men against Stryker and while doing so escape an exploded dam and fly away from F-16's.If you don't think the movie sounds good, well, the stars of the movie are great, especially Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Are you going to see it? I highly recommend it, and it is defiently worth 5 dollars anyday!"
5,CAN WE PLEASE TONE DOWN THE SPOT LIGHT ON WOLVERINE!?,"Gosh it's all about him from the first movie and now this one. Don't get me wrong or anything he's great and the X-Men wouldn't be the same without him but... this isn't a weekly series and waiting for like the next 3 years just to see more of our most favorite X-men characters is just fustrating. Let's have Rogue and Jubilee explore and develope their powers a little more shall we!?Other then the little issue X2 is bigger, badder, and better than the first one!LADY DEATHSTRIKE, MYSTIQUE and NIGHTCRAWLER RULED IN X2!"
3,"Nowhere near as good as 1 & 3, but still better than Wolverine","2.5 to 3 stars at best. While X-Men 2 was nowhere near as good as 1 & 3, it is still 1000 times better than Wolverine (ugh!). Truth is, much of X-Men 2 was a total mess from a directorial and storyline standpoint, but hey, even a bad X-Men movie is better than none."
1,IT'S TRASS!,NOW I REALLY LIKE HUGH JACKMAN AND ALL BUT EVEN THIS WASN'T HIS BEST PERFORMANCE. NY PROBLEM IS THE COULD HAVE GONE ANY WHERE WITH THE SCRIPT BUT THEY DIDN'T. THEY ALSO TRIED TO BUT SO MANY NEW CHARACTERS IN THAT THEY DIDN'T FOCUS ENOUGH ON THE MAIN CHARACTERS. ALSO THE LEFT IT OPEN FOR A SEQUEL. I HATE THAT! THERE WERE TO MANY GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE THAT THEY WASTED. I THINK THAT IF THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT ANOTHER WAY IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT GOOD. IF YOU ASK MY OPINOIN I WOULD SAY IT DOESN'T MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FIRST ONE. I GUESS THE STUNTS AND CRAP WERE GOOD BUT I DON'T LOOK AT A MOVIE JUST SEEING IF JACKIE CHAN CAN FLIP A GUY WITH ONE PINKY. I DON'T CARE! IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND CARE ABOUT A STORY THIS WILL BE A DISAPOINTMENT AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! DON'T CONSIDER IT FOR A MINUTE! IT'S TRASS!
2,Ummm...,"This movie was OK. The plot was a pretty good. I guess I'm just nto the type for these movies. But if you enjoy these type of movies and you loved the first one, you'll probably like this one. I found it a little boring, but it is really action-packed (as I repeat I'm not liking these movies so you'll probably like it if you do) Hmm.. it was well - played but I didn't like the focus on the wolf-man guy (With the claws) THAT was a tad bit boring. But overall it was OK."
5,Lively look at one Turkish Village's Idealogies,"A hearty read with photos to back up fieldwork. Covers issues of marriage, relationships, authority, bodies, land, food, house, village, life/death, religion in relation to procreation.Interesting, engaging and easily comprehended, it works well in a study of anthropology of one Middle Eastern way of life. Feminist issues, religious idealogies, and an intense study of one village causes the author to question along with the reader such basic tenets as Freud's motivations and the meaning/uses of words such as ""seed.""A timeless vision of a rich society."
1,body by jake,"This was not something to work out with, but an instructional video to gain information from for when you are ready to begin lifting. It did not work at all for me, I want something that I can lift weights to at the same time that I am getting instruction. I want a good workout when I'm done. I have been working with P90X and love the muscle fatigue that comes with it, but would like some diversity."
3,Decent Product in this Series,"I purchased four of this particular model and eventually purchased 15 of the over-the-ear style for the sales reps and CSRs in my company. Obviously, the over-the-ear model is much more popular than this behind-the-neck variety.None of the female employees would use this model, even the ones with short hair.Don't get me wrong, this style will work perfectly for anyone who likes behind-the-neck headsets, but, unless someone specifically requests a behind-the-neck headset, get the over the-ear-headset which works wonderfully."
4,Deliverance,This is a great story. Very full of action and certainly not for everyone as it is very graphic. I have never seen the movie. The characters are very well written and the interaction between them quite interesting. VERY DESCRIPTIVE at times which makes it a little tough to get through but would definately reccomend for a thrill ride.
2,Movie is better; first person narrative does not read well,"Movie is better; first person narrative does not read well. Read ""Catcher in the Rye"" for a superior first person narrative."
2,KINDLE edition is too expensive!,"I bought a Kindle with the idea that I'd get books like this for considerably less than if I bought a bound copy. Wrong. The Kindle edition is $11.99. I can get a used one for a couple of bucks. I know, the publisher sets the price, but I'm not happy at the cost of books for Kindle."
2,Cruel and silly,"But apparently it appeals to the manhood of chickenhawks like Dick Cheney. It's got some mystical stuff from the Lewis character about the rural people being braver men. Well, it's really just being accustomed to your surroundings. I've seen both rural and suburban people nervous in a perfectly safe inner city neighborhood. I've read about battle hardening, where men and women stop jumping at their own shadows in a combat zone.I dislike the book, mainly because of its cruelty. I think this is the sort of book that made the 1970s such a meanspirited era, and was take too seriously by some impressionable people who gained power in the 90s and early 2000s.After further reflection, fairness compels me to add the following to this review:James Dickey knows how to write a suspenseful story, and he probably was sincere in his message; he wasn't just a hack writer."
1,"yes, shockingly a one star","I usually only rate the books I am disapointed in and this is no different. This is a rare case of the movie being better-(and in this case)-much better than the book. I thought this book was so bad after the infamous rape part I had to stop reading. I felt there was a lot of homosexual innuendos like when the main character admired his friend's build, and not some guys on a trip but that there was more beneath the surface. Just as disgusting was the relationship between the main character and his wife and 'lubricant'. It just didnt seem like these people were friends, or had any relationships. The situation was clumsy and unnatural. I just couldnt relate so I am throwing up my review for whats it worth. Watch the movie and forget the book. It takes away from the movie!"
1,Dull from the gitgo,"Typical of a lot of 70's era novels, it takes a good one-quarter of the book to get to the actual action. Today's readers don't have the patience for it. I know I didn't. The movie was memorable, the book was not. Yaaaaawwwwwn."
1,This is not a screenplay.,"This was advertised as the screenplay for the film and it was not. It was the book. With a screenplay the format is structured as so one page usually equates to one minute of screen time. In a ""shooting script"", each scene is numbered, and technical direction may be given. In a ""spec"" or a ""draft"" in various stages of development, the scenes are not numbered, and technical direction is at a minimum. The standard font for a screenplay is 12-point Courier.Fortunately I wasn't shopping for bowling balls. I may have been sent bowling ball pins.I was extremely disappointed to receive something so misleading and to have payed for it."
5,"The book ""Deliverance"" sucks you right in!","I saw the movie when it came out eons ago and it came up in a conversation with my friends which jogged my memory. I knew I had to have the book (books tend to be much better than the movie) and what better way to own a book when it is instantly streamed into my Kindle upon payment online!!!! I applaud author, James Dickey for an incredible story that kept me on the edge of seat throughout the entire book. I recommend this book to everyone who loves suspense and twists and turns of events throughout the story."
5,Galco Shoulder Rig for Glock,"The best holsters made in my opinion. If your gona carry a full size pistol in a shoulder holster, this is the way to go!"
2,NOT A JUDGMENT OF QUALITY,"Certainly my rating should not be taken as any sort of objective judgment of the quality of this work. It only reflects my impatience with the kind of work that reflects upon reflections upon memories that are reflections of limited evidence, and so on and so forth. What I had hoped for was a light entertainment in which a discovered fact led to something more than an infidelity in a distant past and a trouble-making raking over of dead coals. Not, as they say, my cup of tea. My fault, I failed adequately to find out beforehand what I was getting into. Can't remember just why it happened."
3,wish i had spent my time better.....,"i never quit reading a book half-way through, but i REALLY wish i had with this one. it was an ""okay"" book... but nothing SPECIAL about it. the ""major scandal"" of the book is that the husband's dearly departed wife had an affair with her brother-in-law. big whoop!not recommended to anyone."
3,Eh...so so.,"I am an avid reader of many genres, and thought that this book would be a good read while I was studying in Italy, along with some others. It turned out to be boring, and I got annoyed with it. I felt like it was too descriptive and didn't really go anywhere. It didn't grab me as a reader, and didn't really entertain me. I am usually left with some kind of reaction after reading a book, be it remembering the characters and plot long afterward or just given to wanting to re-read it again and again, but this one slipped right out of my mind. I have just sold it on here, and hope that they like it, but am not optimistic. The other books I read on the trip, besides an old Agatha Christie were Love in the Time of Cholera and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, both of which I enjoyed immensely and would never sell."
1,Pointless,"This book has so many decriptive details but they are not part of the build of a bigger story. The premise is so promising, an old photograph revealing the potential of intrigue and betrayal. However, we are completely let down as the story goes absolutely no where. If the journey is the point, it is populated by characters that are bland and uninteresting. The reader could hardly care about any of them. This is very much a completely pointless and plodding book. Any one aspect of the following, if well done could have saved the book, a good plot, interesting characters or descriptive details that point to some coherency. Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. The writer is well equiped as her writing is good and her descriptive style is compelling. Too bad that there is simply not enough of a framework to build on. When the core is so lacking, not much can be done."
3,A Good read,I really enjoyed this book - however was a little disappointed in the end - I expected a bigger surprise for some reason - the only surprise was how she died & then you begin to think about how truly self absorbed Glyn & Elaine really are.
3,This is a book to make you consider your relationships,"The character sketches in this novel are fabulous. Lively draws a picture of each character in such a way that it seems you are reading about people you might know.The plot goes basically like this: Man finds picture of his deceased wife that might mean she had an affair. Man seeks to discover his wife's true character using the approach of the historian he is.The plot is a slow moving one. There are no car chases or real excitement and dialogue is minimal. The approach is an interesting one, as each layer of the story is told through conversations and relationships with people who knew the deceased wife.The moral of the story will certainly make you consider how well you know those around you. Is he capable of this, Did she really go through that, etc etc etc."
1,Maybe I'm missing something ...,"but I found this book rather uninteresting and predictable. After all of the buzz about it, my expectation were pretty high and I was rather let down. I kept waiting for the twist or something dramatic and exciting to happen ... but it didn't. I struggled to finish this book."
3,I don't understand why this book made such a splash,"For all the excellent reviews it got, my expectations were very high. I was very disappointed. The book's plot was not overwhelming interesting, nor were its characters. The ending was predictable, and the main character lacked any real depth. Maybe I missed something but I couldn't wait to finish it. All of the characters in the story seemed bland and unemotional.If you are looking for a quick and interesting summer read, try The Seduction of Water by Carol Goodman."
2,Transparent,"Predictable. Obvious. This book left you with no burning desire to finish, becuase you could determine for yourself the ending. It was clear how Kath died without reading to the end. The author spent more time describing the gardens than Kath. The only reason I finished the book was because it was short."
2,dispassionate account,"I found this book to be a dispassionate account of a pedantic researcher who methodically seeks to fill in the blanks of his wife's relationships. The author failed to convey to me any sense of passion, pain or failed moments. (...)..a book more suited to a short story."
1,AN EXERCISE IN MINUTIAE,"Really, I hardly meet a book I don't enjoy on some level, but this one qualifies as an exception. The adjective used by a previous reviewer - plodding - is simply an understatement. I ""slogged"" through it for about 2 chapters, then skimmed the rest, hoping to be stopped in my tracks with something, ANYTHING, that might capture my interest, but it never happened. And while I do enjoy reading at bedtime, I really began to fear that I had a serious case of narcolepsy until I realized that my symptoms started only after initiating this book. The few positive comments I can muster are these: the author clearly has a good command of the English language, an admirable vocabulary, and an ability to write clearly and intelligently. She merely failed to include a captivating plot. While not always devastating (e.g., where the subject matter is highly entertaining and therefore supports itself), it was definitely a fatal omission in this case."
2,Unremarkable,"This story had great potential, but I think that Lively's storytelling, in trying to be understated, leaves much to be desired as a result. The 2 star rating is for her ""painting"" efforts, in that she does write very descriptively, but the overall big picture is hugely disappointing. Until the last 30 pages, I was hard-pressed to find a reason to pick it up again. The ending was, of course, the most intriguing part of the book (yet still predictable and therefore somewhat anti-climactic), but the preceding 200 pages were an absolute bore."
3,Slow yet Intriguing,"Though the description of this book fit perfectly with the type that I typically love and cannot put down, this title did not deliver such an experience. It starts painfully slow with little to pull you along; however, whatever little there was must have been enough because I did continue and found myself quite attached to the characters. Lively did a wonderful job of exposing multiple quirks in each character making them lovable, hate-able, and known. As the story progressed, I found myself pulled into the story and no longer finishing it simply to have a way to participate at book club. Though I would not recommend this as a late night read; it is worth taking the time if you have space in your reading calendar."
2,What the heck?,"Moon Tiger is one of my all-time favorite books, so I started The Photograph predisposed to love it. Wrong! What a boring book! What happened? Who learned anything -- readers OR characters? I gave this book a second star only because I had to look up a few words and thus improved my vocabulary. Beyond that, the plot was boring and predictable, the characters unappealing and pompous, and the conclusion weak and wanting. Depressing!"
4,"A picture is worth 1,000 words","The Photograph is one of the most satisfying reads i've had in a while. Well, right after Stefan Zweig's The Post Office Girl and Stephen King's 11/22/63! Multiple points of view had me riveted, each chapter building on the previous. What happened to the woman in the photograph? Who was she? And the people surrounding her? What was their role in her life? Excellent prose, the height of suspense. Terrific."
4,The Photograph,"This is a rather slow building novel. The central theme is changing perspective over a period of time seen through the viewing lens of an adulterous relationship. To complicate matters, the woman is involved with the husband of her sister. Or to put it symmetrically the other way, the man is involved with the sister of his wife. The author's use of revolving narrators is skillful, which gives the reader material to ponder."
1,the photograph,"It is meretricious pap like this that threatens the good name of the vaunted Booker prize, once bestowed on its author.This contrived tale of a found photo brings together some of the least likeable caricatures of the contemporary English in print. Aside from the opportunity to show off the Latin names of some very ordinary plants and to riff briefly on the history of landscape, the author has woven a predictable and dreary tale of lovelessness better suited to the Ladies Home Journal (if it still prints short stories) than to hard or soft-cover."
1,Painfully Obnoxious,"This book begins nowhere and continues to go nowhere, slowly. There is really no plot and no action, just the usual self absorbed, convoluted musings of pretentious ""British"" characters who often fill British books. You simply can't care a hoot about any of them and lose interest almost immediately.In short, there is no point to the book. Skip this one."
3,Its an ok collection,The two cd's have a few good songs between them that you just cannot find elsewhere for the price or at all. That is the reason I bought it again but as a whole collection it just ok.
4,This is a MUST-HAVE!,"When I first owned this compilation, I had it in the 2-Cassette version and have since ordered the CD set from Amazon.com. The songs are definitely mood music and for those who speak German, songs like ""Heute ist ein guter Tag zu sterben"" are all the more enjoyable. Incidentally, ""Heute"" has samples of the German dubbed version of the movie ""Flatliners"", which I found to be an exceptionally interesting, although mostly useless bit of trivia. Some of the lyrics are racy, so I wouldn't recommend buying this for anyone under 18, but true techno fans should pick this up for some of the classic tracks. German music fans should definitely grab this purely for the cultural experience."
3,Reprint of Lloyd Hopkins novels,"Unfortunately, this book is not the sequel to American Tabloid. Rather, it is the three Lloyd Hopkins novels in one volume. These are well worth reading, however. They show James Ellroy early in his career. The promise of the great writer Ellroy would become is on display in these earlier works."
1,"Awkward, jerky writing","This is my first and probably last James Ellroy. The hero is not believable in any way and not very interesting in the best of cases. Characterizations don't remind me of any real human, nor ones I can imagine. Plotting is sort of ""make it up as you go."""
3,Cop out!,"Hmm . . . let's see. CancerMan does his evil deeds, Mulder and Scully are in danger, there is sexual tension but it's not followed through. I could watch any old episode of the show and get the same thing. It was okay, I would watch DD in anything, but it didn't really go anywhere."
3,Great movie with lots of action!!,The X-Files movie is almost as good as the show. The action with aliens is pretty kic@$$. Although they should've had some people in it which were not. Like Alex Krycheck. And They only had a 3 minute segment with The Lone Gunmen. The movie makes you feel like its just a 2 and a half hour episode but still its great!!
3,Not much different from the television series.,"If you are a loyal fan of the T.V. series, you'll think this movie is like another X-Files episode to enjoy. But if you're not, you'll probably find a bit difficult to understand what's going on. The movie fails to give the audience crucial information about the characters. Like the relationship between Mulder and Scully, who is the Cigarette-smoking Man, what with the bees, and more. The movie also fails to show why The X-Files became a pop culture hit. As an x-phile, I can follow the movie's storyline very easy and quite enjoyed watching it. But I must admit it felt a bit weird hearing Mulder swear."
4,"Very good, too bad show didn't follow up...","I have to say that I was a fan of The X-files in its earlier series before too many continuing storylines ruined the flow and off-kilter appeal of the television series. The film, however, is very, very good, because it is truly the last of the best episodes of The X-files before they moved into the aforementioned continuing storylines.FIGHT THE FUTURE is very visual, and some of the best sets and buildings ever in modern cinema are incorporated in this film. Many of these great sets are brought to gloomy excellence by the dead-on direction of Rob Bowman (check out his THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS for more great visuals - nice cars/effects, lously story). Anderson and Duchovny are, as always, perfect in their roles and they seem to be having a lot more fun, what with being able to swear and such.This is a very accomplished film and you don't even have to be a fan of The X-files to enjoy it... but it doesn't hurt at all if you are."
5,great,"I think the X Files movie stunk! There was no point of whaching the movie! From a scale of 1-10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest, I would rate this movie a -10 since it was awful. The graphics were awful too. I recomend you Do Not See It. Ajay"
2,FRAGILE,"Disc was fine, but box came cracked and pieces broken off. Maybe a cushion packaging next time. No harm done though!"
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!,"My folks were huge x files fans and i remember my father taking me to see this awesome movie, although there weren't that many people in the theater when my father and i were watching it. i love this movie and being only 10 years old at the time, this was also my very first PG-13 movie."
4,For the Philes and... everyone else!,"Not just for x-philes, Fight the Future is a great movie for even a person who has never heard of it.I find it to be one of thoughs movies that can be watched over and over again. There is always something more to pick up, details you've missed, more pieces of the puzzle to be put together.Being a ""shipper"" (wishes a relationship for Mulder and Scully) myself, I loved ""the hallway scene"", and how Chris Carter crushes the hearts of fans with his twisted sense of humor.I highly recommend this film to all x-philes, and I think any X-Files ignorant person would also enjoy it. But be prepared to think, this movie requires a bit more attention than ""Independence Day""."
4,Makes it for SciFi fans,The movies was excellent. It immediately captures the audience and keeps them engaged throughout. The plot is well developed and sinister enough to satify the most serious of X-file fans.
4,Nice and creepy,"The X-files movie is basically a long, creepier episode. The aliens are nice and freaky (yup we FINALLY got to see them) and there are quite a few major suprises in the film. If you're an X-Files fan you must watch this, if you're not then you might still like it since the story is pretty self contained"
2,The Zzzz-Files.,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Considering the amount of money that was obviously invested in this project wouldn't you think that they could have made the effort to come up with a decent script? Think again!There are more plot holes in this outing than I care to number but here's a couple:1. Why did the Arctic facility implode when Scully got injected with the serum? No reason that I can tell other than they had to draw this hokum to a close somehow.And 2. How did the pair get out of the Arctic alive? They were both wet through, Muldar had no coat and Scully had wet socks and no boots so they can hardly have walked out of there - and where did Scully's trousers come from anyway?! Moreover, nobody knew they were there so what chance was there of being found before they froze to death? I'll tell you - no chance!I sat through this for two hours for what? To have my intelligence insulted? Note to franchise co-ordinator: Must do better."
2,X - tremely disappointing,This was nowhere as good as the TV show. It was overlong and boring. It very nearly put me off the show.
4,Pleasing but could have been better,"The movie was a blessing coming during the months between seasons. Those of us who can't wait until the season premier got a rush when the movie came out. It had some great scenes but they could have added more of the ""Lone Gunmen"". The video will be a great addition to your X-Files library."
2,Necessary for enjoyment of the series,"This movie was uncomfortably long, and was not even among the best storylines that could have been chosen for the movie. I don't think making an extra-long episode is the same as making a movie. Too much of the mystery surrounding the X-Files was revealed-making the movie necessary to understanding the continuing TV show. Forcing the public to pay for the movie just so they can continue enjoying the TV show is not a good practice."
3,The Proof Is Out There - Multi-Million $$ Advertising Works!,"If you bill it - they will come!Unfortunately, as a die-hard X-Files fan, I was disappointed with the film. Somehow, Mulder & Scully just seem to look better off of the big screen. Sure, it had some good special effects, a decent plot, and a good supporting cast, but it will most likely leave X-File fanatics feeling a bit cheated.On the up-side, however, unlike the theatre release, the video contains the deleted footage regarding Mulder's sister (Samantha). Sorry ladies - the alleged Duchovny ""booty-shot"" is just a myth...A good movie to add to your X-Files Series collection, and eerily enjoyable for first time X'ers."
3,Some info on pan and scan vs. widescreen versions...,"Ok, so the movie wasn't as good as the tv show, but it was about what I expected so I wasn't disappointed. I'm sure most people interested in buying this video have some idea of the plot, etc. so I thought I would write something useful for those trying to decided between widescreen vs. pan and scan because I have seen both versions. If you have a big tv, I would definately reccomend the widescreen. But if you have a smaller tv, I would think twice about it because the widescreen is really narrow- much more narrow than the ads, which are midway width-wise between the pan and scan and widescreen versions. It depends on what you are buying the video for. If you are a purist, or are buying it just for the ""bee scene"" I would go with the widescreen (the bee scene is alot better on widescreen), but if you are going for general action flick entertainment, I would get the pan and scan version! Hope this helps!"
3,The X-Files,The DVD stuck in the middle of the movie. Overall it played well. It may just need to be cleaned.
3,Blu Ray Review,This is the first X FILES movie made while the series was still in production. Good movie that carried on the series theme.The blu ray disc is really clear & sharp in most scenes but there are some with a pronounced graininess. Suprisingly in the early outdoor scenes with the federal building & the outdoor Texas scenes. Some of the later antartic scenes with the CGI are much better. Sound quality is excellent.This would be an excellent upgrade to your X FILES/blu ray collection if in the $10 - $12 range.
1,The X FIles: Fight the unbelieveable...,"I cannot believe the poor writing in this movie compared to the series... it only serves to compound an ever more confusing and rediculous alien/government plot to colonize the Earth... gimmee a break! They should drop this whole alien plot arc altogether... it does not make sense, and is getting more incredible with each episode."
4,A must-have for any X-Phile.,"Awesome playback quality-- No noticible artifacting when I used software decoding (PowerDVD) on my Creative 6x DVD drive to view the movie. The movie, while more like a 2-hour TV episode than something that would really rock a movie theater screen, is definitely a keeper for X-Philes... Especially since it took the relationship between Mulder and Scully to new levels. A must-have for any X-Phile."
4,hmmmm X-Files MOVIE???,"well I rented this movie all seemed to be great. the only major problem was that I think it lacked in plot. It seems to be all the other stuff the show covers combined into one movie without the ""To be continued.....""'s so if you want to buy this movie do but I suggest you rent it first or even better, see Star Wars!!!!"
3,Better on DVD than in the theaters,"The X-Files:The Movie is one of those many average, mediocre movies where the DVD experience itself transforms it into something better. The sound and digital transfer are superb, although the story still makes little sense -- but if you're like me, you've stopped trying to understand the ""mythology"" story line several seasons ago and don't care. Average commentary, lame ""documentary"" featurette (as is standard with DVD's), overall ""extras"" are subpar. But nobody buys DVD's for extras anyway. Three stars."
3,There are episodes that are way better,"This movie does deal with a number of ""loose ends"" from the season it followed, but as a movie, it's not that interesting or that exciting."
5,You do not need to be a fan to like it,"This movie is a continue after the final of the 5th season of ""The X Files"", and it is a preparation for the begining of the 6th season. However, you do not need to be a fan of ""The X Files"", you can enjoy this movie for itself."
4,"Definately ""THE"" Sci-fi of the 90's","If you are not an X-FILES mini-series fan, the movie might seem a bit ""choppy."""
5,A boombastic thrill ride of a movie...,"The X-files is one of the ten best movies of the year. It combines all the elements of the series on the big screen. I am a die hard fan of the show and I think that this is a great film. I like that you can not have seen any of the regular series and still understand the movie. Some people say that it is like a two hour episode...but how else would you have done it? I have also heard that people were not pleased with the story line. I thought it was fantastic...great effects, and great job by all the people involved. I went out and bought the widescreen version of the movie and I have seen it several times. Go out and get it..."
3,fits into the show,Nice fit between season 5 and 6. Not really a stand-alone movie better suited to people who watch the TV series.
4,An Engaging Romp Through the X-Files World,"This movie has been around a long time and is still fun to watch; in my book that is a high compliment. I have been a fan of this movie for years and still enjoy watching it from time to time.Fortunately it is worlds better than the sequel, ""X-File, I Want to Believe."" If by chance you've only seen the sequel rest assured this movie is vastly superior. The action never stops and carries the viewer along at a fast pace that brings the movie to a close before you're really ready for it to end.If you're a sci-fi fan or an X-Files fan and haven't watched this movie I think you'll find it worth your time."
1,Played like a medicore tv episode,This film is a prime example on why some cult tv shows should never be mainstreamed for the masses. The magic and and elements that made it unique always end up getting lost in the process. This show no longer has the ability to become a viable franchise until some serious continuity flaws are addressed.
1,"great movie bad dvd, also wont run on my system","Same problem that another spoke of, runs into trouble with chapter 2 and ends at the start of chapter 7. Amazon was great on sending me a replacement, and after finding it was the dvd itself offered to take it back for a full refund. Can't complain there, but fox really messed up on a great film to release such a poor dvd..."
1,What a Bomd,This movie crashed and burned. one of the worst films of 98. Stay Clear. Watch Godzilla intead.
1,Never got shipment,Never got shipment. Amazon was very good at crediting my account. USPS is the worst! They lost three of my packages in one month.
2,The Truth is Where?,"Who cares if aliens exist or not? I don't. Agents Mulder and Scully have stumbled upon a mysterious alien landing. They try to diffuse a bomb at the beginning of the movie, outrun a helicopter through some cornfields, fall in love, escape an alien spaceship and still don't come with anything worthy of note in this long, drawn out movie. Average cinema not to be recognized."
4,"Essential, but not great","Enjoyable, but not edge-of-your-seat.The extra features leave a bit to be desired."
2,Ummm........okay,"I have only seen a few episodes of the tv show, and I have to say it's, well, different. Besides being the only show left on network televisoin with no sex whatsoever, some of the episodes are so complicated, they are almost movies in themselves. I did however enjoy a few episodes. When I saw the movie, I found it extremely complicted, and almost boring. Basically, it was like watching two episodes in one sitting, wich I would only reccomend for the hard core fans. The hallway scene was very lackluster, probably because the two of them have hardly even brushed hands in the tv series. At the end of the movie, I still had no idea what the hell their trying to get at with this whole alien thing, and if you ask me its getting very tired."
2,Did anybody else think it was a rehash of Aliens?,"If the movie had just been the first 30 minutes and the bee scene it might have been ok. But I felt like it was rehash of Aliens. I felt like I had seen this movie before.These are the things that do make it worth it. Gillian's killer suits and their onscreen romance. It works well here because you suspect those kind of feelings exist on the TV series but if ever explored it would ruin it as quickly as in ""Moonlighting""."
5,"Cherish the Past, Enjoy the Present, and FIGHT THE FUTURE","originally i watched this movie about 12 years ago and i don't really understand what this movie was talking about that time, i have watched more than 5 times with the explanation from a friend to realize the story of it, after i knew how the story goes, i was in love with this movie. I bought the blu ray, and after watched , all i can say is the transfer of the picture is a lot better than the DVD, and the sound quality also is great, and its worth to collect."
2,We paid money to see this???,"Well here's a cinematic triumph: Mulder gets to say ""shit"", and wow, there's some real cool special effects. Beyond these two gigantic leaps in the film industry, the movie reels off like a 90 minute episode. At least with commercials we could have stepped out to eat something. Scully, as usual, looks great."
4,"Good stand alone plot, left some issues out though","The X-Files movie is a good stand alone feature. One does not need to be an X-File fanatic, such as myself, to understand the plot. Although the movie left out some important issues that were raised in the season finaly and through-out the whole series, it did do a nice job bridging the gap between seasons to some extent. Unfortunately it did give some concrete evidence to Moulder's theories. theories that being egnimatic helped fuel the plot and concept of the show. Over all I felt it was a good movie that kept your interest."
4,"really good, but a little confusing","I had never seen any of the episodes before watching this movie. I was invited to see it by a friend. When it was over, I understood the plot and the characters almost completely. The only thing that I didn't understand was The Cigarette-Smoking Man, I had no idea who he was and what his purpose was. When I got home, I started to watch the series and I understood it quite well. I recommend this move to anyone who hasn't seen, or has seen some of the recent x-files episodes and doesn't really understand the show very well. END"
3,"Good movie, but doesn't keep the serie's standard","I've seen the movie three times, and I recommend it to everyone who is a fan of the show. I'm a big fan of the show, but in my opinion the movie wasn't made for the big screen. But as they made such big secrets about the movie before it came into the theaters, I was really disappointed when I saw it for the first time. There were parts that were really long and boring and they could have easily made two episodes for the TV out of it."
5,X-Files: Fight The Future,"I remember seeing the theatrical release and thinking, how little it relied on TV continuity. (Which really helped some friends who had come with me, who had only seen Jose Chung's From Outer Space.) Over all, the theatrical version was good, and made GREAT by the appearance of Martin Landau and The Lone Gunmen. The video version, with less than three minutes of added footage, changed it into a spectacular X-Files experience. It tied the movie into the TV series, making the movie that much more important. Instead of being JUST a means to keep Duchovny happy, it had a reason for being the big deal it was. (IMHO, the fate of Samantha scene should never have been cut.)"
4,Good movie,"Good movie but the box was crushed when it reached my house. Fast shipping, but the dvd was almost hanging out of the case. I give it a four, not because of it being a bad movie, but because of the quality of shipping."
5,TRUST NO OTHER FILM !!,"Do you follow the x-files ? Do you enjoy a good action packed movie ? Do you want to know about aliens ? Do you want me to shut up and get on with my review ????If all of these answers are yes then this is the movie for you !! It brings all of the ideas and storys from the T.V show and ties it up in a neat little package !! you have to see this if you are a true X-PHILE , but of coarse if not ...... its still a good thrill ride movie !! 1 u gotta c !!!"
2,"Predictable, lame remake of the series.",This movie is a remake of the series. It is fairly predictable and you almost always know what will happen next. The bee and alien scenes were excellent but effects could have been better. In short the movie is lame most of the time and I would suggest watching the TV series.
3,Nice but could be better,I think it was good having a movie out of the serie because other people could know about the serie. But it's a shame that the film is so BAD ! The serie are MUCH better ! If you havn't seen it I can't tell you not to go but can't tell to go either. I can only recommend the series that I LOVE SO MUCH.
4,Great Movie!,The movie is very faithful to the show but on the DVD it says that it has extra footage. Where is it? Oh well it was very good and even greater if you have DTS. (Awesome sound!)
4,this is a great scifi movie,the show is good but the movie is even better. watch this movie if you like sci fi shows or other sci fi movies.
4,Surprise Surprise,"From a non-viewer of the weekly serious, I found this movie easy to follow and extremely entertaining! The movie kept me on my seat too, and I will have to admit made me jump a few times. This is a get me if I have ever seen one. The only problem, where is the DVD?"
3,GOOD BLU RAY TRANSFER,I bought the Blu Ray version to check if the quality is actually better than dvd and it was. The sound and picture were both above expectations and my X Files DVD looks like VHS print with all the grain. I love the style of direction in this movie as it reminds me of an early Speilberg's work.A few good extra's and not a bad film.
5,A masterpiece of science fiction and fun,"I love the show, I love this movie! Way better than ID4 or any other sci-fi movie."
3,Fair Condition,"Great price for this DVD. Gave it to my nephew as a gift. As a used DVD it was in fair condition. A few minor scratches and fingerprints, but it played and that's what counts. thanks!"
5,awesome!!,wow i'm so awed by how fast this dvd came!! it came before the estimated date!! great seller!!
3,Another X-File Episode,"It is interesting that Writer and Creator Chris Carter decided to go big with such a movie (please don't get me wrong I am a die-hard fan of the X-Files TV series). This movie is just another over-glorified TV episode. If you like the X-Files TV series you would definitely like this movie. If not, it is just another science fiction movie with lots of special effects and no real plot (Muldaur and Scully chasing the same old ""alien"" theme and cigarette man trying to stop them). A disappointment. Paramount has made better Star Trek movies!!!!"
3,Good movie - Video transfer not up to current standards.,The movie is typical X Files and was very entertaining to me.This release benefits from a anamorphic transfer howeverthe video looks a little out of focus on my 47 inch screen.
3,X Filers United....,"I know, I know....what took me so long to rent this? Well, frankly I'm not an X Files person/tv watcher. But I finally saw it. The cinematography is well done and the movie is a fun version of the tv show but definitely not worth the wait. While the characters are put into cool action situations and plenty of secrets were revealed, I feel that unless you are an avid fan of the show.....most of this is pretty average sci-fi fare. Also found out the 'true' title of it today......"
4,Dual-Layer,"first of all, this is a dual layer disc.. you seethe transition about 40 minutes into the disc, after Mulder talks tothe cops in Kurtweil's apt. It doesn't say that up there... anyhow.. I liked the movie a lot so I can stand to watch it a lot. It's got a good digitally mixed soundtrack with, and I found the picture quality and transfer to be great throughout... just wish it were dual sided so you could have a 4X3 format along with the 2.35:1 ratio. The audio commentary is revealing, and I enjoy watching this film. It rocks in 5.1 digital stereo, so for all those who don't have digital decorders, get one and lather in it!"
4,"Suspenseful, eye popping, joy ride of a movie","I never watched the TV show before, but I wondered what all the hype was about, so I saw the movie. I was hooked! I watch the show all the time now. My favorite parts in the movie are the bee dome/cornfield scenes and the arctic escape scene. What an awesome movie!"
5,X-FILES THE MOVIE ROCKS BUY IT NOW,"packed to the brim with atmospher, special effects and a little humor. Gillian Anderson does a great job and David Duchovny also fills the big screen shoes well. Go and rent or buy it i have!!"
3,Good movie.,"Although it was just a continuation of the TV series, it was well done. Must see for fans of the series."
3,DVD version [stinks]!!,I bought two DVD versions of this movie. The picture on both movie was distorted. I got fed up with trying to buy a DVD that wasn't. I loved the movie but was confused as to why this was happening every time I bought the movie on DVD.Anyway I give the DVD version of this movie 3 stars instead of five because of the problems I've been having. Other than that it's an awsome movie.If you have been experiencing problems with DVD version please let me know. Thanks.
1,Can't cancel,Somehow two of the same product was ordered. I never saw anything that showed this during the entire ordering process and yet there are two items ordered and I cannot even cancel due to an error that supposedly would be corrected soon please try again and yet I've still been trying and cannot delete the duplicate order.
3,well it was ok some that i watched,for the first time i watched x-files on videos i hate watching sci-fi or reading but it is ok the ones i watched and for the first time in my life i sat down and saw it through the whole movies
4,very good but not as good as expected,"This movie was very well written for the first X-Files movie. I do belive that it could have been much better. For one at the beginig of the movie they had Mulder and Scully playing pranks on each other? I mean ""no"" they would never do that in the series. Other than the fact that the characters didn't act alot like they did in the series it was a good movie and I recommend it to X-file fans only cause if your not your gonna have no idea whats going on."
3,Not enough info!,"Before the movie came out, I watched the show all the time. That season of the presentation of the movie, I had stopped watching. When I went to see the movie, I had no idea what was going on! People said that they were giving all the secrets away, but what secrets?! They didn't tell you what the background story of the secrets were! And if they did, well, I must have fallen asleep! For those of you that don't watch the show, DON'T rent this movie! If you love it, you've already seen it!"
3,"Confusing, but enjoyable if you're a fan","Please see all episodes that lead up to this to understand, otherwise you will be confused. The show is great! And taken in context, so is the movie. I'm not sure a ""non-fan"" will appreciate it."
2,Chris Carter tried to pull one over on us,"I thought this movie was supposed to answer those questions we had about the show..well I left the theater with even more questions in mind, namely, why did I just pay $7.50 for something I could have watched at home for free? At the end of the fifth season it was widely reported that the show was over, so I went to the movie thinking that it would be a nice wrap-up to one of my favorite shows. Instead, I found out those reports were a ploy to get you to come see this movie. I was disappointed, very disappointed. And for those of you who don't watch the X-Files on a regular basis, don't bother watching this movie. You will be lost."
1,"Convoluted, cheesy, and overwrought/A Total Disappointment",Save your money and purchase tapes of the classic episodes. This film demeans the integrity of the show. The story is thin and the bad editing made it look as if it was cut for TV.This Movie also marked the beginning of downward spiral of the show.
1,Worst disc ever,"My review does not apply to the film itself. The movie I like but the Blu-ray release is the worst Blu-ray/dvd I have ever purchased or tried to watch. The disc is rife with errors and the loading time is aggrivating. The one saving grace to this Blu-ray disc was the sound, which until toward the end of the film, was outstanding. At the end of the film the sound became distorted.The retail price on Fight the Future is only $16.99. I'm beginning to wonder if there is a reason for such a low price. I think this Blu-ray was produced on the cheap. A shame since the film itself is pretty cool."
5,fight the future,I already owned the DVD just wanted to get one of my favorite movies on blu-ray without paying an arm and a leg
1,Whats all the fuss about?,I hated the movie. A bunch of hopeless directors and actors and ESP. music directors. The truth is out there DONT waste your money
1,Bad movie? You're soaking in it.,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The plot goes no where (if there is a plot), the effects are b-movie-esque, and the characters suck. Use your money more wisely, go invest in Apple."
2,Fight the Future!,"I now know what ""Fight the future"" means. Fight the future of this series! Just look at where the show went to after the movie. I still can't believe how stone cold awful it got.As for the movie itself, it's alright, but it's a very Hollywood version of The X-Files. It doesn't hold up to the better episodes of the earlier seasons - they're the real X-Files, and very cinematic."
4,trust no one........................,the conspiracy continues from a cave thousands of years ago to the antarctica. our favorite fbi agents are once again up against the government and aliens. don't worry if you yourself have been living in a cave for the past 7 years and have never seen the t.v. show---the movie has a very clever way of filling you in on the story line. special effects are great---won't be remembered as a classic--but all in all a very enjoyable 2 hours spent. trust me............
5,One of the action/sci-fi/thrillers of 1998,"Fan of the TV series or maybe the hype tempted you to see it, either way The X-Files feature film is a definate must.In this Special X-Philes Collector's Edition, you get The X-Files widescreen, the making of the movie and a script and 3 film cells."
1,E.T makes me laugh every day,"I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and i asked myself : ""what is it about ?, is it a joke ?, why so much fuss about nothing ?"". The movie is very weak, there is neither acting nor plot in it. The alien looks like my old carpet. I think we could make a better alien with computer special effects today. Have you seen aliens in Independance Day ? these look like real aliens ! The movie is very representative of the eighties, that is to say with an american family of the middle class, with a good dog and a great barbecue. The music is often tearful with a lot of tremolos. I don't think honestly that E.T could be appreciated by children nowdays, the poor E.T looks like a fake doll. Poor E.T, if i were him, i would go home immediately."
1,An incredibly overrated movie.,"Being born in the E.T. generation, one might expect me to be more nostalgic about this film. The problem is that E.T. is one of the most boring, emotionally shallow movies of the last 30 years. It's only point is to make the viewer depressed over the terrible treatment of an alien being. The creature E.T. is completely unlovable and unbelievable. Spielburg is very good at pushing the viewers emotional buttons, but little else. This movie lacks substance and direction, and I've never felt more bored than when watching this movie."
1,IF I COULD I WAOULD GIVE IT NO STAR!,"This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this."
1,Dreck!,Take a look at the description and photo on Blu-ray.com. It's an overpriced horribly ugly waste of petrochemicals and your money. I wouldn't buy this for $ 10.[...]
4,Liked is as much the second time around,"I first saw this movie about two years ago in 2007.I just watched it again and like it just as much, if not more.What a very wonderful and very nice movie!Steven Spielberg, a master at this, delivers a heartfelt and joyfully suspenseful film about a boy and an extra terrestrial. The movie works beautifully for all age levels.Everything comes together. The VFX, the music, photography, actors and a sincere and lovely script by Melissa Mathison."
5,"GREAT, GREAT.GREAT.",I has been a long time that I seen E.T. I was hopeing to get the Video of it for my grand kids but I can't.
5,Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid......,"I love this movie. It helped shape my childhood. And now seeing it again after all these years, I can enjoy the humor that I was too young to appreciate before. What an awesome movie"
5,The movie that defined my fate,"My parents will always remember the way this movie made me cry as a kid. The funny thing is, it still does. And when I was applying to film schools for college my parents let me go because they saw how much movies affected me emotionally. But why isn't the video available? Let's all complain to Amazon!"
5,Better Than The First Time,"Just another great movie from Spielberg. It was fun to see it again, Makes you feel like a kid again."
5,Great Family Classic!!!!,I loved this movie as a child and I got it for my 4 year old. He loves this movie too!!! Its a great film for family movie night.
4,I still cry at the end of this movie!,This is the best paranormal family movie of all time! I am 33 and I still cried when the spaceship picked up the et at the end of the movie!
5,Grandson Loved it!,Recieved it really fast. Everything was great.Couldnt' wait for my Grandson to watch itand I was right he loved it. It's now our favoritemovie...again. :)
5,Still a favorite after all these years,"The first time I saw this movie, I was eight years old. Now at twenty-five, it still brings tears to my eyes. While, yes, the special effects may seem dated, the story is what really counts. The acting is the best I've ever seen by children. The direction leaves nothing to be desired. This movie will always be at the top of my favorites list."
5,A Definite Masterpiece,"I first saw this movie when I was eight years old when my mother bought it for me and my sister. I didn't understand it at first but now every time I watch it I cry. This movie really goes to show why Steven Speilberg has got to be one of the best directors of all time. As for you fans out there that don't care for Sci-Fi pictures and are reluctant to see it, rent it, it is Sci-Fi in the very least."
5,Childhood Memories,"This is one of those movies that is timeless. I remember watching it when I was a child over and over again and loving it each and everytime. When the the twenty year anniversery edition came to theaters, I was there opening weekend with my sister. I was so excited to see what new sceens were added and to see it on the ""Big"" screen. I laughed, cried and was on the edge of my seat, just as if I was a little kid again. E.T. is a great family movie that encourages us to remember that everything is living and that just because something or someone is different from you, you need to treat it with the same respect and dignity that you want to be treated with. E.T. allows your imaginiation to run wild with the possiblity that there may be other life forms somewhere out there."
4,"No More Walkie-Talkies, Please!!!!!","If you're a purist like me and insist on owning or watching a film in its original form and format than you have to buy this deluxe E.T. package. It's the only way to get the original, untampered with '82 version of this classic film.Yes, here it is! There are no menancing walkie-talkies being wavered around in the air. This is E.T. as it was meant to be!Shame on you Mr. Spielberg for not making this version available outside the deluxe gift box set."
3,Not my favorite!,This is one of my mom's favorite movies. It isn't mine. The best parts was the reese's peices and ET drinking the beer. IMO not Speliberg's best. Try Hook instead. It just didn't do anything for me!
5,"E.T. Is lovable,magical and heartbreaking","I love this movie! When I was a little girl this scared me, but It changed my life when I watched it on t.v. Last year and I bought the movie and I'm fixing to get the doll like I use to have. This is a classic, clearly no one thought that when making this. I have fallin' in love with E.T. And it's a beautiful made movie and fun and so sweet.WARNING little children my find this scary and there is light cussing."
4,Where is Widescreen?,"I just got the DVD after waiting years and was totally bummed when I opened it and it was in ""Pan & Scan""....If it were not such a great movie we never would have bought it."
2,A corny kids film,"I just saw this movie for the first time. To me, this is purely kids stuff. I find it boring, badly acted, an unimaginative plot, and sappy. Emotionally, it does nothing for me. The crass commercialism of flashing brand names such as Reese's pieces and Reynolds Wrap is offensive to me. Calling one's brother ""penis breath"" hardly rates as family fare, and zillions of kids must have emulated that line. One minute E.T. can't talk and the next minute he's speaking the human language and understanding everything--it's all too silly. I have no empathy for the poor, ugly creature--Sorry! Aside from the language, I guess it's an OK older kids (say ages 8-14 or so) film, but a yawner for adults. But then, I'm rarely impressed with Hollywood."
1,"Where is the REAL ""E.T."", as seen in 1982??","Why on earth is the ORIGINAL version of thi film not on this DVD? I was greatly dismayed by the absurd changes made to this brilliant and unforgettable film for its recent theatrical reissue--I would have hoped that all the negative audience response would have at least ensured a first-class release of the original theatrical cut on this new DVD...WRONG! Bad choice by Universal, and one which I hope will be quickly rectified."
5,I must have movie,"I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it to my most resent viewing with my children, ages 4 and 5. This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies that really makes me feel that there are others out there. My children loved the movie and wanted me to find one to buy. I can't wait to add it to our collection of movies."
5,Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece!!!,"Mr Spielberg hits his stride with this affecting and poignant film. The best thing I can say is to quote an exchange between James Stewart and Johnny Carson during a 1982 appearance by Mr Stewart on the Tonight Show. Johnny asks Jimmy ""What was the last movie you saw in a theater?"" Stewart says E.T. and then tells Carson ""You know Johnny? That kid, Henry Thomas, gives one of the best performances by any actor of any age that I've ever seen!""High praise indeed!!!"
1,Duped! Only plays on European DVD players!,The only thing this DVD plays is a message saying it cannot be played in this region.No where when I purchased this did it say this would not play in the USA...
2,Read the book - it's funnier,I was spoiled for the movie by reading the book first and laughing out load in many spots. The movie is sappy in many spots. I guess the book spoiled the movie for me. That and the Bone Fone that came out at the same time.
5,Friendship With an Alien,This was the first movie I saw in the theater and I liked it then. Why it took them eight years to put it out on video Ill never know. Unfortunally I didnt see it in the theater again when they came out with the twentieth anniversary edition. I should have. Like the extended version of the second remake of King Kong its ten times better. I saw that when I got it on DVD. and as I said its good.
4,not a bad kids movie,"this is a decent film with good effects for its time, a bit dated now but most still say its a classic, get it for the kids"
4,A dated classic,"When I recently viewed this movie for the first time since 1982, I realized that the wonder was lost for me. I think that is because the movie leans so heavily on the culture and technology of the '80s. However, kids will still love it because the story is realistically told from a young boy's point of view and because the theme is one of love and hope. If for no other reason, this DVD is worth having because of the phenomenon that it was when it was first released."
4,"Both versions are in the ""Widescreen Collector's Edition""","Perhaps ... cross-posts customer reviews on different products, but while reading the reviews shown for E.T. Widescreen Collector's Edition, I got annoyed how many people were saying they didn't like the effects in the 2002 version. If that's the case, then just watch the 1982 version that comes with this package. See the ""product details"" -- Disc 2 has the 1982 version..without the CGI, without the bathtub scene, and without the ""terrorist"" comment edited."
1,Horrible idea,"This is a way overpriced piece of plastic. In 2002 I bought the E.T. DVD gift set. The list price was $49. Granted it was some years ago. But the point is, the nice gate fold box included: 3 DVDs (2 versions of the movie. The original and re release) and a bonus features disc. Each of the other DVDs also had special features as well. It also included a CD of the remastered complete score. A hardcover coffee table book on the making of E.T. with incredible images. A COA and a matted 35 mm frame of the move! NOW THAT IS WAS A COLLECTORS EDITION! Not this Toys-R-Us horse shit for $140 bucks! I'm definitely buying E.T. on Bluray but not this version. I know Walmart is doing a gift set that includes a cute plush E.T. with the Bluray / DVD / digital copy for only $19 bucks."
2,"Schlockberg, all rights reserved","This movie intellectual level doesn't surpass the one of a third grader. Characters are all one dimensional. Scripting is higly predictable and filled with clichees. As about all S. movies, this also preaches its number of PC ""valueable lessons"". The most common: accept and sustain difference (aliens vs. humans or humans vs. humans). What a repugnant propagandistic piece of ...."
2,"great movie, good features, flimsy package","E.T is one of the best family films ever made and one of the highest grossing films of all time, Universal really botched this dvd release on many levels, First off there is no audio commentery by anyone, i know speliburg will not do commenteries...Enough complaining let me complaiment on the few things universal got Right the Galleries on disc two are nice photos of memborillia and production photos, drawings of E.T etc, The sound is great and I like the option of Having both versions of the film, The only other dvds I own and am aware of that feature movies on both discs are Sherk and Glory which are only formatted differently on each disc. Bottom Line this Dvd is far from what i would have liked for E.T , but it's better then nothing if your a die hard fan. Please note the two star rating is for the dvd release the movie itself is a five."
5,Classic,Classic and wonderful piece of Sci Fi film. Am glad to have it in mypersonal library of films and recommend to everyone.
5,An Amazing Movie!,"I still remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was young, and completely falling in love with the characters and of course E.T. This was a skillfully done Blu-ray/DVD pack that has so many extras. For a true fan of the movie, you will love all of the bonus features that will bring you behind the scenes and let you see how they really made this movie come alive. It is hard not to be enamored with this movie, as it has a bit of everything from humor, to adventure to drama, really something for all. For me I loved the deleted scenes and the behind the scenes, making of the movie bonus features, as I always learn so much more about the movie but also about what was going through the minds of the creators when I watch these. All-in-all, I am so happy to have seen this great new release, as it not only brought me back to my own childhood, but it also allowed me to share a great movie with my own children, who also loved E.T.!"
4,Both versions??,"From the DVD casing (front and back), you can not make out whether or not the DVD has both the originally released movie, as well as the 'remastered and reworked' version......."
1,Didn't download correctly. Color not clear either.,There is sound distortion.The picture is distored and it is hard here it. Therefore it makes for a bad entertainment
5,Pure Spielberg,"""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is a classic and one of Steven Spielberg's most famous films. It's probably the one movie that defines the name ""Spielberg"" more than any other. The logo on the original movie poster comes from Steven Spielberg's trademark ""Amblin Entertainment"" production sign. One of the many things worth mentioning in this movie is Henry Thomas' performance as Elliot. It is the best performance from a child actor I have ever seen. He has a lot of emotional scenes in the movie, which is what makes child actors better. Whenever I hear or see child actors cry emotionally on-screen in movies, I call that great acting {same can be said with Haley Joel Osment's performance as Cole in The Sixth Sense}. I can't wait till a 20th anniversary edition of this movie comes out to theaters 2 years from now."
2,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, &THE VERY BAD...","The only good thing about this special edition is that the original movie is on the second disk. Granted, I did enjoy some of the added scenes with E.T., but overall the digital removal of weapons in the film is an insult to those of us who know how to raise our kids properly and can teach them the difference between real and fake and right or wrong. And also, the removal of weapons destroys the element of fear and belief in the reality side of the film. I mean come on... making friends with an extra terrestrial is more believeable than feeling threatened by cops weilding walkie talkies!"
5,AMAZING E.T. collectible!!!,"This is a totally AWESOME collectible item and I can't wait to get it!! I wish people would stop ""assuming"" that it is an overpriced piece of plastic when I know for a fact that it's not. It's made of a metal alloy, lights up, opens up, plays the E.T. theme music and even has E.T. on the ship's ramp. It's definitely worth the money if you're a true E.T. fan, and especially now that the price has dropped!"
3,"Unnecessary revionism on Disc 1, original version on Disc 2","I would urge anyone buying this DVD to please watch the original, unaltered version first. The idea of ""updating"" older films by inserting computer graphics at the director's whim 20 years later is laughable...I actually threw out the disc containing the ""2002 version"" (blech), and got this solely for the nicely remastered 1982 version."
2,"Review of ""E.T."" movie",i saw the original screen version. I bought your version for my grandson. I could swear there were some parts/sequences that weremissing from your version.Carol Norsworthy
1,Original movie NOT included,"I bought this item because I read a review saying that it contained the original 1982 version of the film. It does not. If you are a fan of the original version, like I am, and want to see it without a cartoonified makeover, look elsewhere. I will be returning this DVD."
1,Censorship and Revisionism Ruin a Classic,"The fact that they went back into the movie and changed all the guns the officers were carrying (when chasing the kids) to walkie-talkies is bad enough. The fact that they actually edited out the line the mother tells her son ( ""No, you'renot going as a terrorist."" ) just ruins it for me. When I buy a special edition DVD I get it to get the original shots, not something that has been hacked and slashed to approval of censors. Definitely Thumbs Down."
5,DVD,Amazon.com has given me the best customer service EVER!! Amazon is now higher on my list than Nordstrom.... And I live in Seattle which is the HOME TOWN for Nordstrom.. I do not want ANY part of my orders to show my real name and address to ANYONE PERIOD PLEASE!!!!Thankyou
2,"Ehh, Dated.","I guess you could call it a Classic if one wanted to, but it really hasn't held up too well in my estimation. The theme & the CG of the day was alright when it came out, but I could barely watch it with my 4yr old grandson recently. He liked it but wouldn't even sit for it to completion in 1 sitting. I couldn't recommend this movie for anyone's entertainment value past the age of 7.E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Full Screen Edition)"
1,waiting,"i would like to see E.T. on DVD. Maybe the studio is waiting after the 20th anniversary rerelease of the movie, next year."
2,"Boring, But Not So Bad!","This movie has nice special effects. But, it gets kind of boring during the middle of it. I can honestly say I don't want to ever watch it again. Well...maybe in about five years or so. I don't understand why the movie had to be so emotional, though. That's what really gets me. I never cry to these movies. I guess that's what makes me think this movie is boring. I would recommend this movie to die hard cry fans, whom always cry, during the, ""I'm sorry, but I've got to go"" scenes."
2,An all time movie that puts you to sleep!,"Come on, an alien that comes to earth? OUCH! And the lighting finger that can heal any cut or wound? It is boring! CapitalB-o-r-i-n-g!"
4,classic film...,"I don't think they could ever redo this film better. But, it's a great entry to the world of aliens and aliens that don't want to kill us. If you've not seen it, you're missing out!"
5,E.T.,Great movie! Bought the Combo Pack so I could keep a copy for home.....giving the other one to my son who saw it for the first time when he was 7. He will share it with his daughter who I am sure will enjoy is as much as our family did the first time we saw it in the theater!
5,Wonderful Movie,"Im sure by now ET is a classic. The quality of picture was great ! Sound was great! I ordered this movie because my grandchildren had never seen it. They loved it and as usual, I cried at the end."
5,E.T. Widescreen is a must,"I want to start off by saying that this is one of my favorite movies. I'm so glad they remastered it onto DVD. It's a must for my collection that includes Mr. Deeds, Scooby Doo, and American Pie. You can see my DVD collection on my lists titled ""My DVD Collection"" and ""My DVD Collection Part 2"". See ya later! Gotta go buy this - HA! GOTCHA! I've never seen this DVD but I know it's gonna be great! Please, buy it. Name is jarule1992. See ya!"
1,UV...a total waste of time.,"I have a rule...if it comes with a UV digital copy....I WILL NOT BUY IT!!!This is a scam by the movie makers and the quality of the image sucks!!!If I want to watch crappy video...I will watch YouTube...and now it is better then any UV digital movie.This is a note to the entire world: TELL THE MOVIE COMPANIES AND SELLERS (Amazon) to not send movies with UV.If you haven't TRIED to get a UV digital movie yet....are you in for a treat...NOT!You have to register a 2 different places and get all the SPAM email and then for your trouble, you get a very bad copy of the movie.I even have another grip...if you order a BlueRay (HD) version of a movie...it should also come with a HD digital copy.iTunes does a much better job of digital movies....and they belong to you!Joe Martin"
