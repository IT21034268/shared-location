2,Catspell,"Arielle Blaylock appears to be just an average Victorian beauty, but she conceals a secret life that torments her. Her heritage makes her a shapeshifter, one who turns into a great cat. Now, two men, each possessing a ""gift"" or curse like her own want to join her destiny to theirs. One has only evil in mind, the other love. Arielle's choice will either save her and let her mother's wandering soul find peace, or doom them both.** Though fascinating concepts are presented, altering the familiar paradigm somewhat, there is relatively little plot here. This is unusual for Ms. Shannon, who normally spins enchanting, in-depth tales. The secondary romance between Shelley Holmes and the scientist Ethan is much more intriguing than the primary one. **Amanda Killgore"
5,COOL & DELIGHTFUL!,"I got this book for Christmas from my Aunt, she said to share someo f the stories with my sister, and defintily read ""Money Doesn't Grow on Trees."" Well I read the whole book! Very cute & awesome! It had a moral for every story, and now I know Money Doesn't Grown On Trees!"
5,Amazing book for both young and old!,"This is a very quick read but has become one of my very favorite books of all time. I read it with my kids and they loved it too. It's funny and thought provoking, inspiring home in the meantime. I've already purchased about twenty copies and given them to family and friends (and they've wanted to get additional copies to share as well).Can't say enough good things about this book! (I just wish it wasn't out of print; makes it harder to get copies.)"
1,Unhappy product did not come,I ordered my item that I was very excited to receive and to my dissappointment I did not receive the item. I emailed the seller and was not sure why I did not receive it. It sucks that you look forward to buying a good item and then don't even receive it. I would love to try and purchase another one but not sure what the outcome would be.
1,I am very disappointed.,It has been over a month since my credit card was charged and I have sent 2 emails to the seller. I finally filed a claim to Amazon since I did not get my book. I am awaiting a resolution. I cannot recommend this seller. Worst experience I have had on Amazon.
1,Always Wear Clean Underwear,"Our family has enjoyed this book together while driving in the car, at the dinner table, before bed and while sitting around the fire. The conversational tone of the writing assists in bountiful conversations. I have tucked away a copy for each of our three children to own as adults."
1,Not As Advertised,"I bought this ""KIT"" and was shocked to find that it had only 4 pieces of the kit, which are useless on their own. After complaining to Amazon, they sent a new one, but I discovered that it was the same story; the item is not as advertised. if you want to install this kit, you will need to buy (if you can find it) the missing shocks, springs, brackets and more. total cost will be more than the kit."
1,dry and academic,"Jensen takes the difficult subject of systematic theology and makes it unreadable. Jensen uses Latin and German expressions without translation. He makes citations and references without explaining them. I have a bachelors and will have my M.Div within two months, but this book was still tough, tough reading for me.But after much struggle, I think I got most of his points. And I didn't like them. Jensen puts God out there, and to a great extent, unknowable. I think that Augustine had it right when he said that theology was faith seeking understanding. Jensen does not seek to understand God so that we can be closer to him, he puts another barrier between us and God. This is a dry academic discussion about God that is utterly removed from the one who came to Earth to save us all. The only reason I didn't give it a lower rating was because the scale didn't go any lower."
4,"Sizes run a little big, looks like the photo","I wish I had one size smaller, but the swimsuit is as shown. Legs are low cut as shown. The material is not all lycra, so it will withstand a person sitting at the pool's edge multiple times, without becoming see-through in the bottom. I'll just say I have owned over 100 Speedo type suits in my younger says as a career swimmer/diver."
5,Love this,"After this book, this really helps me look at people and my own life differently. I have a lot of trauma from being hurt by others and this book helped me forgive them.... for me!"
2,Take what is useful and leave the rest,I found this book a little murky especially when I got to the earth quake prediction (a date that came and went already). If you are new to channeled material (like I was) I would not recommend this book or its follow up of A New Beginning II.If you are interested in Creative Manifestation try Sanaya Roman.
5,Fits great on 2003 Nissan Maxima,"Fits pretty easy, shop was going to charge $300 to replace,. DIY instructions are on the Maxima forum (search for radiator repair)also there is a youtube video that explains more visually. Make sure you review the box contents, it comes with a oil plug spouts. Also fill it with 50/50 water/coolant after installing it."
4,Awesome!!!,"I love dancing to ""Butterfly"" on Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 3. Me and my friends danced to it all night long!!!"
2,Cannot recommend,"The child-suit was flimsy, and of poor quality, I could not recommend. The suit also arrived with packing slip making any return/exchange difficult.I sent an email asking about the delivery schedule, and it took several days to get a reply."
5,Very helpful,This is a very user-friendly for those who want to find out more about jars and their value -- excellent drawings.
5,Fertile for sampling and breakbeats,"Although this disc is in mono sound, this has the feel of a mixtape by the famed Biz markie. Unlike the Pete Rock on the same series, this dude freestyles perfectly and goes nuts on the tables. Seriously, you could get scared that he scratch up his own record collection into oblivion. The number of tracks here are mind boggling and the shoutouts are sort of interrupting more than enhancing. I would get some of this hot stuff because you can't find a big percentage of this on anything on CD etc. etc."
4,Works well.,"Works really well. Doesn't pick up my bonded (super g) network, but the canary website says that so I knew it wouldn't before I bought it. Would be better if its display were backlite (hence 4 stars verses 5).I went ""wardriving"" with it the other night. I was astounded at how may APs there were in my and surrounding neighborhoods. It was actually hard to find a dead zone. What was even more astounding was that more than half were open."
2,Crossfire model too small,"Nowhere in the ad does it state the size of the model. It is only about 1"" long. Much smaller than I expected. It does look a lot like my 2006 Crossfire Limited Metallic Gray Roadster but its size gets it lost among my other models. Good value for the money only due to fact there are no other Crossfires out there that I know of and it was very cheap.Charles"
1,review of ic tv media center,"This is not a good product. It will not install on Win7 and the computer company (honestech.com) does not offer support for it.The seller Goldenruleguy has promised me a full refund including shipping. This is very nice of him.I have always found the Amazon sellers to be honest, and this is a good example of that.Seller gets 5 stars, product gets 0 stars."
4,Tusk bites off more than it chews.,"Rumours II it isn't,Tusk is both brilliant as well as infuriating.We get more Stevie Nicks(Sisters of the Moon, Angel, Storms and of course the classic yet unfortunatly edited Sara) but too much Lindsey Buckingham(The Ledge,That's All For Everyone,the embarrassing Not That Funny,the hit oddity Tusk,as well as five other songs).The biggest problem within the album is that a majority of Buckingham's songs were one man solo tracks which a)lacks the group magic touch and b)sounds like they were recorded on a cheap four-track(especially when the album reportedly cost within the millions).Bravo for the group for coming up with something different,but unfortunately,Tusk bites off more than it chews."
4,"A creative effort, but average fans should stay away from it","By 1978, Lindsey Buckingham had grown tired of the music he was making on huge albums like ""Rumours."" He swore that Fleetwood Mac would be given a totally different sound: and he delivered. With some drum tracks recorded by Buckingham himself in his garage, this album is an avant garde effort that shows pure genius fitting along with insecurity. Overall: Although for a fan, this will be most certainly be recognized as a favorite album, the common buyer should stay away from this album's unfamiliar sounds and quirky melodies."
4,Don't buy this until they have a full length Sara.,"A great album ruined by the hacked version of the best Fleetwood Mac song ever, Sara. There is no longer any excuse for not rereleasing this with the full length version, which I assume was mastered in the early days of CD when more space had to be used for error correction. If anyone at WB is reading, please do this one right. I'd buy in a second if you did."
2,"Full length ""Sara"" please","Do not purchase until re-released with the full-length version of ""Sara"". Or get the vinyl double album and burn your own CD."
5,Not their best but it's good,"I had to listen to TUSK a few times before I liked it. Just give a chance, you might like it!"
3,"Lindsey at his worse, Stevie at her best","Lindsey's songs are as always boring or just alright, almost never great. he messes the album up by hogging the whole thing by using 1/2 of it for him self no wonder you never here any of his solo junck. Most of Christen's songs are prety good like ""over and over"" ""Honey Hi"" and ""Brown Eyes""but for once I would love to here Christen rock. All of Stevie's songs were terrific like she dose not have a single bad song. I love ""sisters of the moon"" a good rock song ""sara"" the edited version was not that bad. I also like ""storms"" and all the rest she sang. Too bad she was only aloud to have 5 songs out of 20 songs on it. No wonder She did a (a very successful) solo Album right after this album was made."
2,What a waste is right,"The review with the one-line summary ""What a waste"" captured my experience exactly. ""Rumours"" and ""Fleetwood Mac"" are wonderful; what happened?"
2,YAWN!,"This album, simply put, is boring. Boring and indifferent. This music is not rock because it doesn't rock. It is not dance music because it cannot be danced to. Lindsey B. may be a great guitar player but his songs are boring. Christine McVie may be a great vocalist, but her range is limited and she's boring. Stevie can neither sing nor play guitar and her pretensious witchiness is boring. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie keep a rhythm which is consistent, predictable, and boring. This record is also humorless. The charm has worn off. Thank God the '70's are over!"
5,I Finally Realize What a Great Album Tusk Is!!,"I love this CD. I never appreciated Tuske when it came out, but now after getting this CD, I am truly in love with it. It actually has such a fresh sound, and I also love the bonus disk."
1,Unhappy customer,"""Sara,"" the best song on the album, was EDITED!! Presumably there wasn't space for all of the songs, so they edited down the best one. Incredible.Don't buy this CD until they restore the full version of ""Sara."""
3,"So much, you wonder could it have been tighter with less","Fans will say more is better, but as an eval of an album, sometimes less is more and keeps the package offered tighter and flowing better musically."
3,MP3s are not remastered copy?,"Good album, at least half the songs are as good as anything on previous albums. But the link from the remastered deluxe copy to the mp3s do not match. The hint is the new version has 21 tracks, bonus cuts and the full version of ""Sara"". But only the old copy is available for download, as I'm writing this."
5,WHITE ALBUM II,"Just like the Beatles after Sgt Pepper, Fleetwood Mac produced an album of stunning diversity under the direction of Lindsey Buckingham, who was obviously riding on the crest of a creative wave. However, the other band members also show off their songwriting prowess on this album, Chritine Mcvie turning in some achingly beautiful songs.The variety of styles and the way that Buckingham produced this album make this for me one of my all time faves - it's just a shame that the CD doesn't contain all of 'Sara'."
4,a newly won over fan,"This deluxe reissue of this disc has won FM a young new fan. You're listening to some truly inspired musicians, which the liner notes compare to the Beatles White Album with every right. This is four songwriters stretching out a bit and even competing in a sense to see who could come up with the best songs. Each songwriter brings something else to the table which added up to something greater than the sum of its parts."
2,Good songs are hard to find,"Given that this album took nine months to record, with studio costs of $20,000 per week, it's a grave disappointment. Fleetwood Mac's ambitions eventually collapsed in a heap of on-ice extravaganzas and creative bankruptcy. A good sound quality isn't substitute for a serious lack of memorable songs and melodies. Besides ""Sara"" and the densely percussive, experimental title track, there's nothing rewarding here. I once had the chance to buy this album at absolutely low price, and even then I didn't want it. What about all these simple, half-way developed tracks? If any other band had released this album, nobody would have noticed. If I could, I'd give this disc a 1 1/2-star.They would hit ground again with ""Mirage"" and all their solo projects."
3,Tusk,"With bar set so high for Fleetwood Mac after the enormous success of their last studio album ""Rumours"" it was surprising just how different a direction they took musically. It has long been known that most people treated this album as mediocre album however die hard fans and even non fans found this harder edged rock in roll album quite good. ""Tusk"" was the idea of guitar player / singer Lindsey Buckingham who wanted to make an album on a smaller budget and the result is a 2 record set with a varying degree of songs. ""Tusk"", the albums title track recorded with the USC Marching Band is a great rock tune while the ballads ""Storms"" and ""Sara"" are magical songs that prove just how much of an enchanting voice Stevie Nicks has. Christine Mcvie fares best with ""Brown Eyes"" and ""Never Forget"" while Buckingham does a good job with the hit single ""The Ledge"". Overall the album is good, but since allot of the material is radically different then the usual hits it makes it a tough sell."
3,y ep they chopped the best Stevie songs on the album,and left the insane babbling of a coked out Lindsey intactthe album is A TOTAL 5 STAR
5,"FUNNY, FUNNY stuff... Vince Vaughn is the MAN","Loved it! Funny like ""Men with Brooms"". Vince Vaughn is awesome in it!JP"
4,Fun movie!,"If you enjoy Lawn Bowls, this is a fun movie. The American accents were also fun... being they were British bowlers -- but being American, we could forgive them, LOL."
5,I just watched this movie on Hulu.,"When I see National Lampoon in the title I don't expect too much , but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. I think most of the negative reviews of this movie come from those who like the usual junk that National Lampoon puts out, and since this movie is well written, acted and directed it puts them off. If you're someone who enjoys a well written character study over bathroom humor, I think you'll enjoy this film."
1,I feel for your situation...,"I really miss having After Dark on my computer, it was a fun program (I especially miss the cows flying to Wagner's music). Sorry to hear about your situation, I know where you're coming from; When I installed OS Lion on my mac, it immediately made Word, and other programs no longer work ""...Power PC [programs] no longer supported...""."
5,Great Music,I am an Al Jarreau fan and you won't believe how many times I have purchased this cd! I have let folks borrow it and never see it again. I will hold onto it this time. This is just great music!
5,Al Jarreau - All Fly Home,This CD brought back good memories. I love Al Jarreau and wanted to get some of his music. This will be treasured.
2,Another Grisham departure,"This is the second departure from legal/corporate thrillers I have read from John Grisham. Skipping Christmas I loved. Bleachers on the other hand is a realatively good book, but I expect more than just good from John Grisham."
2,A FUMBLE ON THE KICKOFF!,"I have been squawking about writers just phoning in the usual fare, but I won't anymore. When it comes to writing about football Grisham is great author about the law. This book fails to capture the imagination and beyond a proffessional job and a good edit, there isn't much praise I can find for this novella. In fact unknown author Thorne Peters wrote a far better real life version of this story in his novel AROUND ELVIS about the boys at Hillcrest High by Elvis' mansion that is not only a great football book but a societal microcsim with Elvis in the center. Tidbit: Grisham actually played football at a high school a few miles from Graceland Mansion, just over the border from Elvis in Southaven Mississippi."
1,BORING,"Aside from being boring, this story has been done many times before: athletic hero does semi-well, returns home to be confronted by characters from the past, the coach he hates turns out to have good qualitites after all, yada, yada, yada. Reminded me of Pat Conroy's ""real-life experience"" book, but was not nearly as interesting. John, give this up and go back to ""dance with the one that brung ya""."
1,What was he thinking?,"I am a BIG Grisham fan, however what was he thinking? This book drones on and on with no real story. I was VERY dissapointed and since it is so short, I suggest everyone read it AT the bookstore if you want to try it."
3,Good afternoon read but not much more,"I enjoyed this book however, I didn't find much worth noting. The story doesn't invent much when it comes to hard nosed football coaches who drill tough love into their players. I wish that Grisham would have developed more areas to expand the book to be a novel instead of a novella. For example, Rake's friendship with Nat or his relationship with his wife are very rushed as is the ending which is all too predictable. Fans of Grisham should read this book as I did however, people looking for a good and new high school football story may want to give this one a miss."
4,great not just for the sports fan,"I have to admit at first I was a little hesistant to read this book even though I am a football fan. I've never really been a fan of Grisham books, but when my mother(who LOATHES football) told me how great it was I knew I would have to read it. Despite the length of the story (it was short), it was absolutely enjoyable...and definitely brought back alot of memories to an also former high school athlete. But I can respond on my mom's behalf that this book isn't just for the sports fan, it's for anyone who's ever wanted to be young again."
1,A disappointment,"This is not the Grisham I loved to read.Luckily, it was just a few pages .You can skip a word, a few lines or even some pages and you still don`t miss anything.There is no thrill, it is simply boring.I yearn for the old Grisham, will we ever be able to read a similar novel like ""The Firm"" ????I doubt it.What a shame."
3,Good- but not great book,"This is a story about a bunch of ex-football players who gather together and recall memories of their high school careers. The reason they all reunite is because their high school coach just died, and his legacy is one of dominance on the field with a win at all costs attitude off of it. All of the charachters have gone down different paths and their tales are interesting but far from riveting. All in all I was hoping for a little more from John Grisham, but this was a little different realm for him."
1,The worst yet,"Whatever happened to the thrillers Mr. Grisham used to write? The last two books of his have done nothing for me, I guess I am expecting the same kind of excitement as in ""The Firm"" ""Pelican Brief"", etc."
1,Lame!,"I can't even believe that this is a Grisham novel. The story was soo lame. Could've been written by an 8th grader. Totally ""contrived"", ridiculously stereotypical characters. As mentioned by other reviewers, the story went nowhere. Quick read, thankful that I didn't waste more time on this. Other reviews were quite critical as well, but gave it 3 or 4 stars....don't know why?? This novel is pure fluff."
2,SKIPPING BLEACHERS,"I like football and a good football story--I watch PLAYMAKERS--- but I didn't like this book even a little. It was way too JUNCTION BOYS and soooo cliche. The characters were obvious and predictable carcatures that had no dimension. I didn't even like the charater names. I mean did he search the tool shed to come up with ""Coach Rake."" And ""Neely"" is the name of a pill popping prissy girl in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. There was no drama and this plot never unfolded, it just dragged along from the beginning to the end in straight narrow line. But he's Grisham, so I'll give him another chance...BTW--- Thanx for the tip on AROUND ELVIS it was awesome."
2,Bleachers failed to entertain me..,"As much as I love John Grisham, I can honestly say that Bleachers was one of the most boring books that I've struggled through to complete. Rehashing old football games is not my idea of entertaining. Pages and pages of reenactment of some faded out, high school football players was so boring. Mr. Grisham, stick with what you do best. They say, ""if it works, don't fix it.""RL Myers"
2,Not his best,Definitely not Grisham's best effort. I kept waiting for the point. I found the story boring; it went on and on with the same tendency to overstate without saying much of anything. I enjoyed Painted House but would recommend passing on this one.
2,"sadly, not Grisham's best","Though this book was able to hold my interest, it lacked the flair and genius of John Grisham's other works. If you are a fan of his work, as I am, this is one of the only works that may be better picked up at the library for a quick read. Unlike The Testament or A Time to Kill, it won't keep coming back off the shelf to enjoy again and again."
2,YAWN.......,"Having played high school football made this book almost tolerable. The book is just so much pointless repetition that there is really nothing worthwhile to be said about it. I wished I would have read something else as the ""pay off"" I kept hoping for never materialized."
2,"Save Time, Read the Flap","This is basically how I felt about this book. I have enjoyed Grishams many other novels. I did, however, prepare myself that Grisham was attempting an out of character attempt at a sappy reminicient novel. You can read the flap summary and figure out what the outcome of the book will be.I figured out the ""big secret"" of the championship game, in the first few chapters. No twists, no suprises as normally is a Grisham trait.I finished the book quite quickly. I think you can safely say that no movie will be made from this novel!"
2,Not my favorite Book,"I loved A Painted House!! However, this book did not live up to my expectations. I was glad this book was short, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. It had a feeling of its going to get better, however it never really did. Something is just missing! I do not recommend this book at all!"
2,Disappointing,"Well written, but poor story-line. We've heard it before -- young kids who hate their too-driven coach, until they realize upon his death that the coach wanted the best for them. This story-line shows no imagination on Grisham's part.To the thought that this book is about a teacher/adult who inspires kids, if that's what's it's intended to be, it falls miserably short."
5,"Bleachers by John Grisham, Audio CD","I Listened to it on audio CD. It was Read by the author and was very enjoyable. It is Very different from many of John Grisham's other works, but was very well written, moves along quickly and makes a person think about one's own actions in any situation dealing with others. I recommend this book to all who are John Grisham readers. This was One of the best audio books I have listened to and it was more enjoyable having it read by the author, John Grisham. I recommend this book to everyone. John Grisham writes with knowledge of his subjects and also writes so that all, young and old, men and women might enjoy his works."
4,Bleachers,"Could John Grisham ever write a bad book? I think not. This book could be longer but even short and sweet it was still a must read. Larry Hobson Author -""The Day Of The Rose"""
4,The internal strife of a small town former hero...,"Grisham strays far away from his typical legal battle du jour in this tale of the internal struggle of a former small town hero. The main character Neely Crenshaw is a former star quarterback and must battle his own demons to figure out how to pay homage to his former coach. There is a secret that has haunted them both for years, and no one in town ever found out the truth...until now...If you enjoy heart-touching fiction in the style of Mitch Albom (""Tuesdays with Morrie"", ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"") then you very well may enjoy Grisham's latest. However, if you are looking for his usual action-packed legal thrillers, then this is not the book for you. Keep that in mind and this book can be a good read for almost anyone."
3,Nothing special,"I guess that if you are a foot ball fan like me this book is OK, but most of it is similar to listening to a broadcast of a football game over the radio.Apart from the football narration this book has little else, so if you don't like football a lot stay away from it."
3,Grisham Fan,"It was not Grisham as he usually is, for one thing (which we knew ahead of time) it is not a 'lawyer story'. Secondly, it was a story without a major plot. It was more like a guy reminiscing about the past. It did have an ongoing 'thing' that happened in the past that throughout the story you really didn't know exactly what had happened. When revealed, it wasn't really a huge thing, no big secret or twist.Overall it wasn't bad though, just not Grisham as usual. But if you are a Grisham fan, you'll still like it.And, one of the benefits about this audio book, is that the story is read by Grisham himself!"
2,Pretty bad stuff,"Boring plot. Not sure where he wanted to go with this one. Some of the material seems stolen from Friday Night Lights.I'm a huge football fan, and I found myself dying to be done with this book.Poor work."
3,Disappointing...,"Long story short, I expected a bit more. But when it all boiled down, all we get is a short story half borrowed from Friday Night Lights and half from the movie Varsity Blues, with a little Junction Boys thrown in for safety sake. As a Grisham fan who has enjoyed his legal and his non-legal work, I put the book down feeling like I did not get all that was coming to me."
4,Bleachers*,"I recently read a book called Bleachers by John Grisham. The book is 227 pages, although it's a pretty easy read. This book is about a man named Neely Crenshaw. He played for a high school team called the Messina Spartans. Most would've said he was the best quarterback Messina ever had. This book is told from Neely's point of view because his coach, Coach Rake, is dying. He goes back to Messina and starts talking to all of his old high school buddies. They talk for hours about Coach Rake and their memories of him. The thing is that Neely and Coach Rake had some issues in the past and now that he died Neely knows that he needs to forgive Coach Rake. If you love football you will love this book. Although if you aren't a fan of football you probably wouldn't enjoy this book as much."
5,Good Book,"i think this book was very interesting. It was nice to read a book that didn't have a lawyer as the main character. I enjoy football, so this book gets 5 stars from me."
5,Excellent work!,"I am a high school student in NC. I was extremely satisfied by the content of this book. It was very enjoyable to read. I come from a small town like the one he describes in this brilliantly crafted piece that tells a wonderful story. Grisham captures the essance of what it's like to be a god in high high school where people will always remember what you were, but that's the part you'd wish they'd forget. I especially enjoyed the quait ""lost love"" twist. The realism just hits you in the face. I could not put the book down. I read it in about 4 hours. It was such a pleasant and easy read in contrast to Grisham's other works. Reading it is a great way to spend an afternoon in relaxation. It will conjure up old memories so thick, you'll have to brush them away from your faces. It's a very delightful book with good-hearted sentiments. I suggest that anyone who has been through high school read it, and let the memories flow freely."
2,Predictable and Weak,"As I've not read Grisham before, I picked this book up at the library to give him a try. From what I know of him, I sense that this is not him at his best; it is a diversion from his usual thriller/mystery approach.Regardless, this book seemed quite amateur in terms of its plot and outcome. I kept waiting for something 'big' to happen; whatever it was that Neely had to deal with. I kept wondering 'What is the conflict between he and Coach Rake'? I won't give it away, but I was terribly disappointed with what the pages revealed; it wasn't really anything at all. A lot of lead up to a dissapointing climax. I also didn't find the 'emotional' scenes the least bit emotional or riveting.Better luck next time with Grisham. Guess I'll have to try one of his classics."
2,At least it was kinda about football,"I suppose alot of men, like me, really wanted to read this book. It's Grisham. It's football. How could it be bad? Well it is. It's actually rather boring. A story simply doesn't work unless the reader feels some kind of emotion for the main character. Whatever that emotion may be. In this case, I simply didn't care what became of Neely Crenshaw. His story never moved me to sympathy and, as he grew more pathetic throughout the book, by the end I was just glad it was over. Short of one chapter in the middle where a group of former players sit around remembering the big championship game, this book is very dry."
4,good quick read,as a female who loves football i really liked this. great insight into the team/coach relationships and small [Texas?] town mentality
2,High school athletes reminiscing... No thank you.,"I read this quite a while ago, but I'm using previous notes to create this review. First let me say, this is not the genre I generally read. I don't know why I picked this one up. Or why I finished it.There isn't a plot to speak of. Basically it's several high school jocks drinking in the bleachers and reminiscing about their much-despised football coach. They've all returned for his upcoming death and funeral. Their conversations lead the reader through the past and things are learned about the characters, but to what end? I couldn't connect with these people or find any desire to care about their stories. I found this book dull.Again, this is not the type of book I typically read, so it had little chance to score well with me. To be fair, please check other reviews of people who read within this genre. I've read other John Grisham's that were great. This one, not my cup o' joe."
3,Bleachers Review,Not Grisham's usual but a good book to read. Delves into characters as well as morals. I recommend it to Grisham fans.
2,Was this already a movie?,"You will ask yourself if you saw this movie? I have read other John Grisham novels and he will always be one of my favorite storytellers. However, this one didn't do much for me. Good thing I'm a big sports fan and love football. If you don't know football, you should kindly put this book down. Wouldn't put this one into a John Grisham Gift Box Set."
4,Small Town Football,"If you like small towns you'll like this book - if you like small towns and football you'll love this book. It's a quick, engaging read. It's a departure from Grisham's legal drama. Great book!"
4,"Not very deep, but riveting...","I really enjoyed this work of Grisham's. Not as deep as ""The Painted House"", but just as interesting and entertaining. As a 50 something male that grew up in the south, across the river from Mississippi, he brings you home in so many ways..."
3,OK!,"Although I always love when John Grisham wanders away from lawyer tales, I found this book only ""OK!"" It still has some typical Grisham predictability. Recommend? Yeaaaaaah, I guess!"
3,Like Chinese Food,"I have to admit I enjoyed this book but it will be forgotten very quickly. The problem was the lack of character development and plot. I still don't know what the main character did to his ex-girlfriend that was so horrible. However, I really enjoyed the football stories and the speeches given at the end. Overall, a nice light read but don't expect it to stay with you."
3,Nice short read,"I found this book to be a nice read if you want something quick. Someone purchased it for me as a gift, knowing I was a Grisham fan. It didn't have the same level of detail and suspense as his other novels, but it was a good story with some interesting characters.Anthony Wilbon, Author of ""The Enigma of Njama"""
1,will it ever end?,I listened to this on CD while on a road trip and I wouldn't recommend trying this alone. It made the trip seem longer and almost put me asleep at the wheel. It started out slow and never even hinted at picking up. I couldn't have been happier when I was done with this book.
1,Waste of Time,Don't bother with this book. It reads like the script of a bad made-for-television movie. The dialogue is implausible and the story boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
4,If you are not an American...,"Be careful.If you are not an American like me and not familiar with football (I do not mean soccer), you might need a lot of patience to finish this book.I was about to give up reading this book during the middle part where an old football game story was going on and on...The last part of this book was beautiful and enjoyable for everyone, though."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"I AM A DIE HARD GRISHAM FAN, I ALWAYS BUY HIS BOOKS BASED ON NAME ONLY, I NEVER LOOK AT THE BOOK UNTIL I READ IT, AND BOY AM I SORRY I DIDN'T LOOK AT THIS ONE. IF I HAD READ THE FLYLEAF I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT, BUT SINCE I DID, I READ IT AND I WAS EVEN SORRIER. IT WAS SO BORING I HAD TO SKIM THROUGH PARTS JUST TO FINISH IT. IT IS ABOUT AN EX JOCK WHO NEVER GOT OVER THE FACT THAT HIS FOOTBALL CAREER ENDED BEFORE HE WAS READY TO MOVE ON, AND CONSEQUENTLY, HE NEVER DID MOVE ON. GRISHAM NEEDS TO GET BACK THE MAGIC OF HIS FIRST FEW BOOKS OR NOT BOTHER WRITING, BECAUSE AFTER THIS, HE WON'T MAKE IT ON NAME ONLY."
3,It's Okay,"I am a big Grisham fan, and I have read and enjoyed every one of his books. This book however, never seemed to go anywhere. I live in the south and I know how we worship our football and it's players, so I found the book very believable and real. It's just that it seemed a little predictable. Here is the quarterback hero returning home for the first time in a while, and he has issues. Who doesn't? He feels like a failure, has no real direction in his life and made stupid mistakes along the way. What I didn't like was that there weren't any surprises, but on the flip side of that it was very real to life.Read it if you have nothing else pressing to do."
2,Good start but falls far short for a Grisham story.,"Grisham once again goes outside of his normal area but this time he falls far short of meeting his normal standard. The story idea was good. The characters started off interesting but Grisham did not develop them. By the end of the book I did not care about any of them. I wanted to know more about the Coach, the quaterback, the punter etc. Grisham needs to go back to letting us meet his characters."
1,Get a life!,"I wanted to tell each and every character in this book to grow up, quit dwelling on high school memories and to get a life!"
1,This book is so bad...,...it just makes me think of a whole generation of Al Bundy's dreaming of their lost youth.
2,Disappointing Grisham,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham but this book strays from his traditional writing. There are no courtroom dramas. Gone is the suspense that you can usually expect when picking up a Grisham novel. In this book former football players come together in a small town to await the inevitable death of their former coach, a man who was loved and hated. They wait in the bleachers, discussing their triumphs and their sorrows that were shared with every member of the town each time the team hit the field. They console each other in an effort to forgive the past mistakes and move on to the future. Although this book was well written, it would have been more meaningful if I were a sports fan. It was a very short book and for that, I was grateful. Grisham is an excellent author, making it possible for me to even finish the book; but I hope that he returns to the courtroom in his next venture."
1,I wanted to like it.,"I like Grisham and I went into the book with a positive attitude. But, god, it took forever to read. I only finished it because I had invested the money. And then, the ending, was worse than everything that preceded it. These people should get a life."
4,good read,"A personal touching story with deep roots. If football is a part of your life, or any coach has helped mold you, this is an entertaining easy read."
4,great read,"Bleachers took me by surprise, as did the author of the book, John Grisham. His books have often bore me but this was I was highly impressed with this one. Being from a small Texas football based town, I really enjoyed the emotional aspect he captured in his book. It was not just about football but so much more. The past is a hard place, and some people have a hard time moving forward from what was so great so long ago. I think anyone could read this book and enjoy it, not just avid sports lovers."
4,A total surprise!,"This book really surprised me! I did not want to stop reading. And I don't really know anything about American football, and that's what they keep talking and thinking about. Maybe it was the team spirit and the going back and reliving the adolescent years and meeting those people from that time. Not much happens in it, but I really liked it nevertheless. I don't really now what I liked about it, just that I did. And to make me like a book like this, means the author has really succeeded. It's been years since I last read a Grisham book. I really need to read more again."
2,"Rambling, should have been a short story","As described by the editorial review, this is ""physically a narrow book"" akin to a short story. I listed while driving on a long road trip, with nothing else to listen to, so I persisted, thinking the story must get to the point. The exploration of a former highschool athlete who doesn't make the big time could have been well done within the length of a real short story. Instead, very little was dragged out to create a book, that sells on the Grishom name. I've lost faith in what has become the Grishom book mill."
2,bleachers,"In a sentence, Bleachers is about middle-aged, retired high school football players visiting their high school hometown to reminsce about old football stories, good or bad, because their beloved, yet hated, coach is lying on his deathbed.Personally, I thought this was not a very good book. With a bounch of men visiting their past, it is all a buch of what-ifs. I found it annoying and boring. It wasn't a very happy book either. You thought maybe at the end of the book they would resolve their past problems and get on with their lives. Not very likely. Messina, the all-about football town, is somewhat pathetic. I am pretty sure they would do anything if wootball was outranked by nother sport.I would not recommend this book. But, however maybe you have to be older to appreciate this book, because my parents liked it. THat had to count for something. Happy Reading!"
2,"Certainly, Not His Best","I am a Grisham fan. I've read most of his books. Somehow I missed Bleachers till last week. It's OK. Lot's of guy stuff. Lot's of dialogue. The story is very thin, however. I never did really get into the main character. I was especially confused by his old girl friend interest. The book is short ( too short for its $20 hardback price !) .If you like Grisham, it's probably time well spent. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,These Bleachers are HARD!,"I was very disappointed in this selection. Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored! Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!!!"
2,Only jock-sniffers need apply,"As someone who has read all of Grisham's prior work, I was disappointed at this bloated treatise which would have worked better as a novella. Although I am in my 40s, I was not a jock in high school and so I guess I don't understand all the fuss."
2,Boorrrrrriiiiinng,"I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away."
1,Would Not Recommend,I found this book extremely boring - one of John Grisham's worst ever. I skimmed through most of it just to get to the main point of the book.
1,bad book. dont waste your time,"Dont waste your time reading this book. It has nothing....storyline, suspense or even effort.Waste of time and money."
2,Boooorinnnnnng,"Repetitive and unsatisfying. There are too many other books more deserving of my time, so I'm disappointed in myself for finishing it."
2,Dissatisfied with condition of the book,The book arrived. It had an odor to it and the pages were brown as if it was stored somewhere for a long time. It was listed in very good condition. I don't think so. This is the first time this has happened.Lynn J. Schroeder
5,Another great one by Grisham.,There was never the great climax in this one but somehow Grisham keeps you reading. Once you start this one you can not put it down. Thank you Grisham.
2,Bleachers,"I went to my schools library and I asked the librarian what was a good book for me to read. She asked me what I liked and I said sports, or something that will keep my attention the whole time I read. So she introduced me to the book Bleachers. I started to read it in class and I didn't want to put it down. It kept me thinking on what was going to happen. Or what happened. The book has a lot of life's lessons in it. How to deal with issues. Me being an athlete I understood what Neely went through. On how the coach doesn't do things to hurt you but does them to help you. It also says to live life to the fullest and do what you love and you won't have many regrets. That is exactly what coach rake did. He did what he wanted to do. That was coach football. He coached for 34 years and he only had to regrets. That to me puts the book in perspective."
4,Nice portrayal of a small town and its former hero.,"For me, this book was a very quick read.While not a big fan of football, I am a Grisham fan and his writing was as good as ever in this book. I really enjoy stories about small towns and stories that tell the history of a person or a group of people, and this book fit the bill."
2,Highly advertized painful read,This highly advertised book was a painful read. I only finished it because it was short and I was on a plane. The whole journey (or lack of a journey) was painful.
1,just plain bad...,"I love Grisham books, but this one is just plain bad. Boring, little plot and very tough just finishing it..."
4,Bleachers,"This is a very good book which is about the looking back of many football players and there memories of their playing at ""Rake Field."" It shows how one town can be so into football in there town. The book is viewed through the eyes of Neely Crenshaw, an all star quarterback who returns to Rake Field for the first time since his playing days there. Crenshaw remembers his high school life about his football memories on the gridiron, and off the field with his problems with a girl. All who have played for Eddie Rake (the legendary coach) return to Rake Field to remember him while he is in his last couple days. I liked how the story had many views of different guys and their playing days. I didn't really dislike anything about it. This is a very good book that I would recommend to you if you are into football, or just looking for a good book to read."
2,How could it be the same author?,"What ever happened to the John Grisham who kept eveybody on the edge of their seat, reading ""The Client"" and ""The Firm""? I have trouble thinking that the same person wrote ""Bleachers"". H.G."
2,"Starts Like an Undefeated Season, Ends in Disappointment","John Grisham is a great storyteller, and Bleachers started out with a lot of promise. Too bad that the novel faltered and died along with Coach Rake. Grisham had a lot of ways to go where he could have tied up loose ends and even brought in some lessons. Instead, the novel ends in cliche and angst. Perhaps Grisham could have learned from the words of Coach Rake and ""never quit."" What a shame because the first half of the novel was good enough to be among his best writing."
3,Better than I expected,Enjoyable read for a cold afternoon. Finished it in an hour or so. Maybe copying Losing Season by Pat Conroy?
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"What a bore! The story is about a dying football coach and the deathwatch that ensues. The coach was not a likable character - so the reader really didn't care one way or another if he died. In fact - I was hoping he would hurry up and die so that maybe the story would pick -up. It never picked up. Just alot of boring dialog between a bunch of ex football players. As for the main character, Neely Crenshaw - he was a loser. He never made it as a football star because of an injury in college but The author just seemed to make him a pity party. Poor Neely Crenshaw. Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda. Even his ex girlfriend (whom we were led to believe by the dj that there would be a reunion or something happily ever after) had no use for him. There really wasn't one likable character in this story. There was no plot, no action - really no point. The most ridiculous part of the story was when an ex-football player turned Prisoner was allowed to attend the funeral. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,An Interesting Look At High School Football And Role Models,"This is the second Grisham book I ever read, and I know it is out of the ordinary. This one did not leave me at the edge of my seat. Rather, it is an excellent character study.If you don't read this book for any other reason, read it for the excellent segment where a group of former football players are listening to an old game. It is an excellent combination of the radio play by play, commentary from the participants of the game, and some narration. As a sports fan, I consider that to be excellent writing.This is an excellent look in the world where there are no good guys and no bad guys (to use the words of Dave Mason, singer of ""We Just Disagree""). It shows the bonds of friendship and mentoring. I would not consider it my favorite novel, but it may be better writing than what Grisham is better known for."
3,"Okay, enjoyable, and (wisely) rather short given...","...the rather thin material. This is an unusual Grisham novel, not his best by any means, not much happens, just some old high school friends thinking back on their ""glory days"" and Coach Eddie Rake, who taught them all how to play - and win. Unfortunately it seems Grisham didn't consider this manuscript very important and skimmed through it quickly like a reader - the dialogue is often pretty fake but overall if you're out on a beach it'll keep you entertained. I read it in a few hours and I'm glad I did."
3,"good theme, shaky storyline","A realistic fiction novel by John Grisham, Bleachers is a touching story of All American high school football quaterback Neely Crenshaw. Neely's professional career was ruined by a cheap shot to the knees.Now, 15 years later, He has come back to his home town, Messina, to mourn the death of his old coach, Eddie Rake. He sits on the bleachers of Rake Field with old teammates to relive old games, talk about old memories and secrets, waiting for the field lights to dim.This story has a good theme, with many lessons of life, love and regret, although the storyline falls misreably short of Grisham's potential. It is not a page turner, and the scenes seem to drag on longer than needed. Reading this novel did not enspire me to read any other storys of this nature."
1,Nothing to it,I borrowed this as an ebook from the San Diego Public Library - I'm glad it was free because it was worth nothing - kept waiting for something to happen - nothing ever did. Maybe football fans would like it.
1,Surprisingly One-Dimensional,"When I picked up Bleachers, I was startled by how short it is--I've come to expect hundreds of densely packed pages from a Grisham novel. Like many of the reviewers, I think the book reads more like the outline of a novel. The characters are simplistic to the point of banality. The ""mystery"" at the heart of the story is not mysterious or even suspenseful. It was difficult to care about any of the characters, much less bother to keep them straight (half of them seemed to have been in jail at least once between high school and the present day which I guess makes them ""colorful""). I was disappointed in the book and very glad that I borrowed it and didn't buy it. I'm hoping that the next Grisham book I read contains writing of his usual caliber."
4,Solid,"Solid sports book. I enjoyed it. It wasn't my favorite book of the year, but it was closer to the top than to the bottom.Will those not into sports enjoy the read? Possibly. But it's definitely designed for the sports fan.Also recommended:Playing For Pizza: A Novel"
2,Grisham should stick to law....,"I love football & the idea of remembering ""glory days"" as one ages, so I thought I would enjoy this book. Unfortunately, this story did nothing for me. It was filled with dull dialogue that seemed to go nowhere."
2,At least it's short!,"First, read the ""Editorial Reviews"" - you'll get the entire story.Reading it, I felt like Grisham didn't actually write it, but gave the outline to an underling. He even must have used a junior editor, because every instance of the word ""coach"" was capitalized; drove me crazy, since it appeared about foour times a page. I think the same thing occurred with ""south"" (only lowercase}, but I couldn't find it and I certainly wasn't going to re-read the book.Read it if you feel you must; it's not a bad story, just kind of pointless (other than the constant ""Quitters can't be winners"" allusion). I would have given it three stars but for the above-mentioned grammatical errors."
4,For the love of the game,"Bleachers is a gripping tale of love, hate, and reconciliation. Set in Smalltown, America, the story centers around the impending death of Eddie Rake, the much adored and much hated, long-time coach of the Messina Spartans. Told through the eyes of Neely Crenshaw, one of Rake's boys, an All-American, we relive his glory days playing for Rake, the coach he both adored and hated. This is truly a story of broken dreams and missed chances, but fortunately, forgiveness heals old wounds and provides a second chance.Teens and football fans alike will enjoy this side of Grisham. They will feel and share in the excitement as the players relive the infamous 1987 championship game, I recommend this book for high school students (grades 11 and 12) and to anyone who just loves the game."
4,Bleachers,"Bleachers is one of my favorite fiction books. It is a great book that tells about former high-school football games that were plated by the Messina Spartans. This is a book that reminds all of those Messina Spartans how great they really were. After their great coach got fired from his job and got a life taking disease, the players and the fans gave up hope for the team. When all of the players went off when they grew up they always said they would never come back, 15 years since he had played on the field, 15 years since the all-american number 19 had played on the sacred turf, 15 years since all of the great memories. Sitting in the bleachers watching the lights come on, the former players are deciding if they should hate there old coach Eddie Rake that is dieing or if they love him.-Will Strickland"
5,Only some can relate...,"This is a wonderful book for those of you who have played high school sports under a coach like Eddie Rake. After the fact, you realize how meaningless those years were despite the vicious importance placed on them by little people like Rake. However, you do learn lessons that stay with you, although I don't have any burning desire to constantly seek approval from my high school coach, who was no more than a control freak and a loudmouth, like Grisham's characters do. Nonetheless, Grisham writes an enjoyable novella. Not his best work, but still worth the purchase. I understand those that didn't enjoy it, but not many people can truly relate to such an experience.. and if you cannot, you may not like it as much as others. But Grisham continues to be one of our most wonderful authors. I never hesitate to pick up a book of his."
5,for everyone!!!,"Bleachers was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It had everything from flashbacks to comedy to sadness to a love story. For example, with all the flashbacks all the players that played football at the high school would meet up at the bleachers every night and talk about their memories of when they used to play. If I had to recommend this book to a certain type of reader I would recommend it to everyone. That's how good of a book it was."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love John Grisham, however, I wanted my money back on this book. I thought it stunk!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The biggest waste of time and money,This was by far the WORST MOST BORING book Grisham has ever done. Don't waste your time or money.
2,MITCH ALBOM SHOULDN'T WRITE ABOUT THE LAW,"This was a poor attempt to recreate the magic of THE JUNCTION BOYS, which it failed terribly to do. In fact the best book out about a high school football team out right now is AROUND ELVIS by Thorne Peters, about the kids over at Elvis High School in Memphis winning big for the King. Grisham's cover of a high school football squad's melancholy reunion where they flashback, recriminate, and lament, is convoluted and dull. The old, ""We hated the coach but we loved to play for him,"" tale is corny and cliché and was worn out by the Green Bay Packers."
1,Give me a break!,I am not a fan of Grisham. The only reason I read this book was that it was the monthly selection in my book club. What this book did was confirm my belief that Grisham is an over-rated writer who can't develop a character or a story line if the fate of the world depended upon it. Give me a break. Didn't everyone want to shake Neely and tell him to get a life. Don't waste your money or your time.
2,Not so good,"I'm not an avid reader, but I usually enjoy whatever I do read. This one was surprisingly boring, especially from such a well known author. Without playing high school football, or growing up in a small town, it gives some insight, but I found myself uninterested in any of the characters and completely empty and kind of releaved when I finished the book. Hey, at least it was short."
3,Different kind of story for Grisham,Would not really recommend this book. Does not go into enough depth with characters and is too short. The best part was the game commentary. It's like you were there.
1,Not one of his best,"I believe Grisham should stick to his lawyer stories- I always enjoy those, and feel I have learned something.This book was almost painful to read- I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did.No one grew- no one learned, and it was over- before it even started.If you MUST read it, wait for the paperback."
3,what is the point?,"I would call it a ""bad"" book to read, it's just that nothing really happens. I feel if the book were longer, and told the story from the beginning (aka: when Neely was in high school) it would have had more of an impact. The books covers the course of one week, and at the end, i was thinking ""ok...so what was the point?"""
4,A truly enjoyable book,"This book was a quite good look about one man can affect hundreds upon hundreds of people. I really enjoy John Grisham's legal and non-legal books (this one is non-legal, like Skipping Christmas.)This book's main character is Neely Crenshaw, a man in his twenties who is haunted by past demons. Among these demons is his old football coach. When he hears the news that coach is dying, he goes back to his hometown of Messina, FLA. He finds, not to his surprise, that just about everybody who ever played for Coach Eddie Rake is there, waiting for the old man's passing.Eddie Rake is a man not differing too far from General George S. Patton. He loves the game of football like nothing else, and sometimes he makes critical and frightening errors when getting caught in the mood. He is also a great coach, and an inspiring man.I rarely found myself bored with this book, as it is a short read and is quality. Thank you, John Grisham."
3,Grisham not at his best...,"Well, i have read all of Grisham's books and this is definitely not his best. Try reading The Firm or The Pelican Brief. They are much better. But, if you still want to read this book, don't buy it. Just borrow it from the library. Not worth the price of a hard cover book..."
1,A sad waste of time,"Fortunately, it is a short book. About halfway through, you'll find yourself wondering if there was any point at all to this effort, and at the end you will see that there was not. I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to read or might not have bothered finishing it.Were it not for Grisham's fame and past successes, this one never would have seen the light of day."
3,Adequate,"This book was a story that has been told before, there were no surprises, twists or turns. If this was a first time author, I doubt that it would have been published. John Grisham has reached a point, (actually, he reached this point about ten years ago!) where he can write anything and it will be a bestseller. Will there never be another A Time To Kill from this author? Once you get past The Pelican Brief, it is all a downhill slide. That is not to say that this book, as well as his other works, are not enjoyable, they just don't grab you and hold you like his earlier work."
4,Length isn't everything!,"Longtime Coach Eddie Rake of the Messina High School Spartan football team is dying, and his former players are coming home to the bleachers to roost like buzzards. Some of the former players made good and some not so good. This is not vintage Courtroom Drama Grisham but there are a couple of lawyers (including the Judge delivering a eulogy,) a few criminals (including one in an Angola-like Penitentiary,) and an Old School Southern Sheriff.It's a sometimes Faulknerian, nostalgic look at the Religion of Southern Football that you can read during commercials on NCAA College Game Days. Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
2,Not too EXCITING!,"I thought BLEACHERS was an ok book. It showed how important football is in most small towns, which might have been hard for some people to relate to. I think Grisham could have made the book much more exciting. He really didnt draw you into the situation as much as he should have with a book like this. I did think the end was good because he finally let Neely show some emotion.This would be a good book for someone who really likes football and other sports or someone who can relate to the trials that highschool athletes go through. Otherwise I wouldnt reccomend it."
3,Not his best,"John Grisham's books are intriguing and well written, even his venture in other areas of writing besides legal thrillers has been great. But this book wasn't his greatest. It was good in showing broken dreams and it was heaertfelt and inspiring, but it was somewhat boring and could have been written a little better. It's crazy to think Grisham can only write legal thrillers. His other non-courtroom books were great. this one just falls a little short."
3,Pushing the box and outside the envelope,"Obviously readers who thought they were getting the usual Grisham legal thriller were disappointed in the high school vignette they were treated to. However readers should realize that sometimes even bestselling authors want to try something different. I applaud Grisham in that effort. Too many times, I've read a new release by a tried and true mega author and it seems it's the same story hashed over with slightly different characters.Some of the negative reaction is just because Grisham is writing out of his genre. Think what the reaction would be if Stephen King wrote a romance, or Nora Roberts a horror novel. Even if the book was terrific, there would be a roaring backlash from their fans.Dee Power, Co-author OvertimeLost love, found glory and a football game for the ages."
4,true but sad,In bleachers there is a small town that is all about its high school football team. All of the townspeople love the legendary coach but many of the players who come back for the coaches awaited death have mixed feelings about the coach. It focuses on certain players from a certain team in 1987.To start i was a high school football player and this staory almost mirrored my situation. The main character was a quarterback who struggled with his view on his coach. I went through that my whole highschool career. This book made me wonder if this happens at all high school football programs.Another big reason i like this book was because of all of the other related situations and characters to the main story. It showed many different perspectives from many different people. It really shows John Grisham was a high school football player because i know noone else could have written and referred to these situations without having gone through it.
3,Not the best,"This is the first Grisham novel I've read in years. I used to read many of his legal thrillers till I figured out they were all the same. So, I decided to tackle this. Some of the dialogue is trite and unnatural. The story tends to be sappy in places. I felt like I was supposed to be crying, but I never got that emotionally involved with the characters.The basic idea is something that most of us can relate to, but there needed to be more character development."
2,Disappointment,"After reading Grisham's other non-law stories, I anticipated more from this story. Those who have played football can probably relate to the feelings of the players in this book, but those who are not sports fans will have a little more trouble finding enjoyment in the book. Typical of Grisham, the book does read fast and pull you along, but definitely not one of his best. I would recommend this book to sports (especially football) lovers butI hope to see better in the future."
1,Don't waste your time,"I own and have read every book written by this Author. This book is best summed up in one word. BORING. I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. What a complete disappoinment. For all you die hard Grishham fans, save your money and skip this one."
3,Average Football Story,"This is a good story of love, regrets, and football. True, it is not Grisham's best work, but I would prefer Bleachers over any five hundred and some page book. Bleachers offers an interesting story, although the conclusion is a little flimsy. This is a fast read. It is only a hundred and some pages. Not the greatest book ever, but if you have some time on your hands, I would recommend this novella."
2,Save Your Money!,"I, like so many others, have read every one of Grisham's books. Fortunately, I read this one from the public library. If I didn't know better, I would think this book was a first attempt from an aspiring writer. Hard to imagine that the same person who wrote ""A Time to Kill"" could pen this drivel. Read it if you must, but save your money & borrow it from somewhere."
1,A Waste of Time,"I found this book to be trite and predictable. I admit, maybe I am not the target audience for this as a female who grew up in an urban area and went to a high school with no football team. But frankly, I couldn't believe that 30-somethings would still be dwelling on their days playing high school football. I mean, it is really as if nothing happened to these people between the ages of 18 and 32. None of the characters were very interesting, and they were all two-dimensional stereotypes - the ""good girl"", the ""hometown hero"" etc. etc. I skipped through the rather lengthy section that was a play-by-play of a radio announcer describing a high school football game. In total, this was a very dull book."
3,Not what you'd expect,"I suppose I had higher hopes for a Grisham novel about high school football. This was slightly disappointing, though it did remind me of my own hs football days. If you're expecting a gritty Grisham novel, stay away."
3,Bleachers,"Anybody will be able to empathize with the quarterback protagonist who goes back to his hometown to wait out the passing of his former high school football coach. Sitting in the stadium bleachers, former players shared memories about their legendary coach. The players recalled the kind of kids and players they were while coming to terms with the men they are today. Interesting characters, emotional tugs, with a solid ending puts this book on my TOP Three FAVORITES reads ofof Johns Grisham Books, for now."
2,I really tried to like it,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Grisham fan. I think he is a brilliant writer. However, this book was bland. After laboring through it, I had to ask myself what was the plot or even the point of the book. It was like reading the diary of a nun. No drama, barely any conflict. It was absolutely lacking. I am glad that this wasn't my first Grisham book because it would have been the last. Nonetheless, I look forward to more of his offerings."
3,"Not vintage Grisham, but pleasant enough summer read","My review might as well be the PW review above. It's got some great phrasing and memorable imagery, but it falls a little flat. My expectations were much higher with Grisham's name on the front. Without giving it away, my greatest disappointment was with the ""secret"" that builds throughout the story and is teased in the marketing copy on the back of the book. The big secret that Neely (the lead) must confront is a real snoozer. I expected much, much more when it finally comes to light.Nevertheless, it's a good summer read with some fun writing and plenty of pages to admire."
2,Varsity Blues Copy Cat,I thought this book was very similar to the movie Varsity Blues. Grisham is a talented writer and should be able to come up with original material.
4,Bleachers,It was a good book if you played sports in your youth .It will help you look back with fond memories..
3,Childhood Influences,"Grisham points out in his book that sometimes the people that we hated growing up were the ones who had the most influence on us: the ones whose words and deeds we remember the most vividly.The obsessions of small towns with their high school athletes are sincerely described throughout the novel. As seen across America, the high school sports hero does not live up to his full potential as he creeps toward middle age (probably an impossible feat). This read is a reflection of the hero's regrets and loss of opportunities."
2,"If you enjoy reading about ex high school football plays and players this is the book for you. If not, don't buy - rather stupid","If you enjoy reading about ex high school football plays and players this is the book for you. If you enjoy reading about 30yr olds sitting in BLEACHERS remembering former glories, this is the book for you. If you enjoy a good plot and story line, this is not the book for you."
1,Boring!!!,"Thought I would try John Grisham, but unfortunately I picked ""Bleachers"". I AM a football fan, but could not get past the first 25% of this book, it was just so BORING. Should I try another or are his books all this boring?"
3,Suprised,I think it was good but so different from most Grisham books that I kept waiting for something to veer from where it was going.
4,Not your ordinary Grisham novel,If you're an avid Grisham reader this is not what you might be expecting. There isn't any high suspense. The coflict centers around a high school football coach and his glory days. I would equate this to John Grisham's attempt at a Nicholas Sparks type novel. It is a good story and a quick read.
4,MUST READ FOR FORMER ATHLETES,"If you ever played a sport in high school, this is a must read for you. John Grisham captures the feelings of the realization that you can go home but not go back to what once was. I had a high school coach who was one of the strongest influences on my life. The unbearable demands and unreasonable expectations he placed on me motivated me to become more than I ever thought I could be, not as an athlete but as a person. Fast reading and very enjoyable."
4,"Trite, light--but enjoyable just the same","I can't really say I'm a Grisham fan: Up until now, I have only read one of his books. After reading ""Bleachers"" (on the advice of my father), I have to say that I enjoyed it in spite of myself. More aptly termed a ""novella,"" Grisham's novel had all of the cliches and caricatures of every football story you've ever read or heard, but I guess that's what made it so enjoyable. After all, that's the way a story about high school American football is supposed to be. It's what we've come to expect from this genre, and Grisham lives up to that expectation. Nothing earth-shattering here--even when the title character gives in to introspection, it's still rather surface level--but nevertheless as easy to enjoy as a fall afternoon of football."
3,Not his best,"I picked this up as fast food at a bookstore located next to where my kids were playing. When they were done, so was I. A pleasant enough read, but nothing has compelled me to pick this book back up."
2,JG Should Stick to his Law Books,"I bought this book for a quick read in an airport. I have read most of his other books so I thought, ""well can't go wrong"". I was wrong. The boook was a drag from start to finish, I actually read the book as fast as I could to get it over with. At only ~265 pages I was a bit suspicious about getting the book in the first place as most of his books are >400 pages. I am also a former high school football player and although I am not from Texas, where I know high school football is HUGE, this book did nothing for me.The book takes place over a 3 day period and just really DRAGS and DRAGS... I would stick to ANY of his other books, which so far have all been excellent."
1,"Skipping ""Bleachers""",Am a football fan but this had no appeal to me. It just dragged on with lots of play-by-play. Where did vintage Grisham go?
4,Bleachers,"Although this book is not the typical John Grisham book, it is still well worth reading. If you liked the Christmas book that Grisham wrote then you are sure to enjoy this one. This was an enjoyable, relaxing read that takes you back to your highschool days. I hope that every once in a while Grisham will take us out of the courtroom and into our own lives, its a joy to read these type of books, written by such a great author."
4,Solid and great for light reading,"Grisham's latest novel was very easy to read and is much better entertainment than the usual fare of reality TV and daytime talk shows. It's not intense like his legal thrillers and short enough to finish in two or three hours.The book is a vignette on the life of the forgotten local hero and a small town in the South whose lives revolve around high school football. Although the character development is not deep, I felt like I didn't want to delve into their lives anyway. I think the author's intent was not to do that, but to help us sympathize with what they're just feeling during those few days that the plot spans. It's a nostalgic look on how things were and how things could have been. Read it if you're feeling older than you really are. I'm 18 so it just helped me relate to what people my parents' age feel."
1,15 yard penalty,"Heavens is this book bad! Weak plot, uninteresting characters, uninspired setting, and one huge cliche. Thank God it was a library book and only took an hour of my life. You want to know what my version of hell is? To be stranded on a desert island with only ""Bleachers"" and ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven."""
4,Bleachers,"A great book about much more than just playing football. John Grisham has done it again with this one.The moment I picked it up, I could not put it down."
2,Bleachers by John Grisham,"Eeeek! This is the first Grisham book I'm not buying. ""John, Man, I miss your usual strong and wondrous writing voice."""
3,the next chapter,"After reading the Painted House I was curious to read other Grisham books to see what all the fuss was about with this author. I am by no means an intillect but I do enjoy a book with more substance, enough to keep my heart beating. I have read most of Girshams books since reading The Painted House and have thoroughly enjoyed them all, most likely because they had something more thought provoking than a Sheriff eating biscuits and drinking coffee. I perhaps do not look into the meanings of some messages as deeply as I should (maybe thats what I am missing in The Painted House and Bleachers), things like not returning to a football field, I can't find the meaning. I should also mention I did not like reviewing Romeo and Juliet in high school either. Grisham should be writing thought provoking and hold your breath till the next page books. This was not."
1,One to Miss,"In this lurching yarn, Grisham tries out new territory and fails miserably. In A Painted House, he created a deep and satisfying sense of place, memorable characters, a moving story. Here, well, it all just comes up flat and depressed.There are many potential subplots and avenues to explore, but Grisham just plods on toward the inevitable end badly.Yes, it's a quick read. Yes, it resurrects memories of small-town football.But it fails to move, fails to involve, just plain fails."
2,Very Disappointing,"For anyone who has participated in interscholastic athletics at a high level, this work is truly fictional. There's no plot, no message and nothing that relates to high school or collegiate athletics in the real world. It is an easy read so one does not have to spend to much time on Grisham's poorest work to date. Stick to the legal stuff, John, or try something on the order of another Painted House."
3,Bleachers - Book Report,"This was not the greatest book in the world but it was a pretty good read. It keeps you interested and at the end it all comes together. It's only 163 large type pages so you can get through it quickly. If you like books about sports or battling inner demons, you will enjoy Bleachers."
1,Author's should never read there own novels,"Grisham reads the book himself in a monotone, so if you arebuying the audio version of this book, please save your money.Maybe the print version is better?"
2,Disappointing,"I'm not a fan of John Grisham's legal thrillers (Scott Turow is a far superior writer), but I enjoyed ""Skipping Christmas"" so I thought I'd give ""Bleachers"" a try. Thankfully it was a short book, otherwise I may have quit halfway through. It's full of cliches and seems like it could have been written by an English 101 student. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because of a few nice touches (Nat the bookseller was a good character), but otherwise it was a disappointment. I agree with the other reader who wrote that this book is selling on Grisham's name alone; that's definitely true."
4,Better than Grisham,"Grisham does have his hits (books that rock), misses (books that suck), and the occassional bunts (books that promise much, but deliver little in the end). However, I must say that this took me totally by surprise. I found the writing and story to be---I don't know---DEEP. (And no, I'm not some nostalgic, ex-jock.) The story was simple, yet engrossing. Pure, emotional, and (did I say ""deep""?)"
3,Bleachers,This book was fantastic but very short. In the 4 hours it took me to read it I was laughing and crying.
3,Quick and Easy Review for a Quick and Easy Book,"A one sitting book that is okay and tugs at the same heartstrings that movies like the Best of Times and Rudy reach for in guys everywhere. The book is okay. It is not necessarily beneath the author, but it is a departure for Mr. Grisham."
1,The Bleachers - Review by Mario Baldassarrini,This book is very boring - quite a disappointment in respect of the typical books by John Grisham
3,good Grisham...,I am not a big fan of Grisham's lawyer novels..always found the characters rather 2-dimensional and contrived plots but I really enjoyed this book...it's a quick easy read and will take you back to the those high school memories..no great plot or surprises but an enjoyable. warming story...
3,Short--in Length and Plot,"Not a lot happens in this little book. What tale there is is, as always, well told by Grisham, but this is no fast-paced thriller. The best that can be said is that it is a little poignant, little sad, little book about the impact of a Woody Hayes-style high school football coach on the lives of his players."
3,she-wolf hunting,"Brenna Lupe is the sister of Alex Lupe, who has gone missing. She has decided that she needs to find him so she goes looking. While looking she encounters Carson Turner, also hunting Alex, a DEA agent and a man with a mission. Alex was his partner and Carson believes that Alex killed his family and is now involved with a treacherous gang.It's not a bad read but there were times where my usually flexible sense of disbelief failed to suspend sufficiently. I like werewolf stories, and the scenes with the dog and the scene where Carson found out that Brenna was a werewolf are some of the best I've seen but overall it seemed to lack a certain something to bring it out of average."
3,IThermaltake W0117RU ToughPower 750W Black PFC Power Supply with Active PFC Dual Fan,"Lo unico que no me gusto de la fuente son los tantos cables que tiene, ademas trae muchos conectores molex de 4 pin que ya casi no se usan, son un desperdicio. Del resto la fuente esta bien, la compre por error creyendo que era modular."
1,Melted,Ordered the product and a month later when It arrived it was a melted glob with string. I recommend ordering something like this in the cooler months.
1,"LEAK, LEAK, LEAK","About one year after owning this iron it leaked - lots of water!! After ironing three items the iron started leaking so bad that I had to bring it to the sink. If I tipped it sideways (left or right) it was worse! Also - very difficult to clean the sole plate. My sitter ironed her shirt on too high a setting and left a ""burn mark"". I tried everything to get that spot off and couldn't. Take your chances but I know I'm sorry I did."
2,"Indifferently sung, dully conducted.","Except for Margaret Price, and Kurt Moll, the cast is mediocre at best, and Moll has recorded this role in better surroundings (for Solti and Sawallisch, for example). The rest are vocally unattractive, don't compensate with much character, either.Davis' conducting is dull, unimaginative, and entirely lacking in the sort of joie de vivre that is essential to this opera.Unless you like your Mozart featureless, give this one a pass."
3,For Completists Only,"This here is a complitaion of songs from different sessions that for the most part were not good enough for any of his regular releses. Therefore its great for hard core Hugh Cornwell fans but for those looking to buy his best CD. For that, I suggest GUILTY or the US version of Guilty ""Black Hair Black Eyes Black Suit""."
2,Footprints in the Desert - Hugh Cornwell review,"I must agree with all of the negative reviews for this album. Being a Stranglers/Hugh Cornwell fan for just over a year, I have been delighted with their music. I have collected most of the band and solo albums and am severly disappointed with FITD. After being totally satisfied listening to Guilty, Wired, Hi-Fi, or even Wolf (which took me a dozen listens to be able to stand the Cd and now it's a descent filler), this album sounds like a bunch of meaningless(that's putting it politely)songs written by a 12 year old and sung by Hugh. Anyway I won't go on, but thank god for the good albums by both him and the Stranglers. Thank you Hugh."
3,Footprints in the desert,"A collection of songs that were either singles or recordings that were never previously released. As a consequence this is very patchy 'Everybody"" is good so is 'I can't handle it' which was even better live. It's an obvious for the fans album."
2,They hit a sophmore slump,"The Roches' second album ""Nurds"" is a huge slip from the perfection of their debut ""The Roches"" and their return to that same successful Robert Fripp produced formula with ""Keep on Doing"". The songs are decent but this doesn't compare with the Fripp produced works.However, ""One Season"" is among their finest songs and is the highlight of the album. This song takes the three highly discernable singing voices, establishes them in a pretty harmony, seperates them into a difficult to listen to, purposely out of tune chorus and then brings them back together. ""My sick mind"" is also a good song with each sisters' voice establishing their own identity.After all, to listen to the Roches is to be force-fed the completely different voices of Maggy, Terre and Suzzy Roche."
4,Good but not the best,"The first Roches album (""The Roches"") was astonishingly good. This second one (""Nurds"") is preferred by some, and does differ from the first one in some important ways. The songwriting is less Maggie-dominated. The production is a bit warmer and the arrangements a bit more instrumentally varied. And the vocals sound a bit more natural (Fripp put an electronic shimmer on the vocals on the first and third albums that is missing here). And though it has its high points--my faves are ""This Feminine Position,"" ""The Boat Family,"" and ""The Death of Suzzy Roche""--it has its weak points too: the title track is kind of funny but doesn't sound good, the a capella cover of ""It's Bad for Me"" is boring, and the concert favorite ""Factory Girl"" sounds curiously flat.Overall it's a good album but I'd advise newcomers to start with the first one."
3,A little too quirky,"The Roches are unclassifiable. But they do project a self-image of nerdishness, not unlike Weird Al Yankovic. Their songs are not strictly comedic, however.Nurds is a very eclectic album. Factory Girl is like an old folk ballad from the old country. There are quite a few ""relationship"" songs. The instrumentation is generally sparse. The Roches have a distinct style of vocal arranging, which I wish I could adequately describe. They never attempt to sound especially ""pretty,"" let's put it that way. At times they are given to deliberate dissonance (One Season) or just off-the-wall vocal noises (Nurds).I thought the songs on their first, self-titled album were higher quality and easier to take. However, many people might prefer Nurds, with its higher level of experimentation. I don't. Nurds (the song) is a fun self-deprecating romp, though.Listen before you buy, if you can."
2,"Carboard floors, not a good idea!","""Includes colorful wooden columns and cardboard floors.""This version of Villa Paletti has carboard floors instead of wooden ones.I personally own the version with wooden floors, which costs $1 less the last time I checked: http://www.amazon.com/Wiggles-3D-90039-Villa-Paletti/dp/B001KVMDN0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_t_1The difference is significant. The game is all about the stability of the structure you can build. Using cardboard floors between each level is unlikely to facilitate this. And because the shape of the floor will change with the time (along with humidity, kids and simply playing to it), the durability of this version is very questionable."
2,Good toy but board not straight.,"The game is good and fun to play.However the copy I Got has its main board warped by humidity i Ghuess,I can play anyway but I Have to use another homemade base board."
4,Interesting read,"VdC gives a pretty good gloss-over history of dreaming and what certain people thought of them; how certain philosophers and psychologists thought of them. He also recounts several studies and the statistics that were drawn from them - which are quite interesting.One of the studies on lucid dreaming describes the participants methods for inducing lucid dreams, and the method happens to be almost identical to a method I've successfully used before, which I originally got from a book called ""Control Your Dreams""."
5,Perfect Library Resource,"As other reviewers have stated, this book reads like a dissertation given all of the works cited. The author has definitely done his research and is comprehensive in covering all aspects of dreaming. The information presented is interesting and fascinating, but the book is not for those who would rather read a novel than a textbook or term paper. I, alas, am one of those people and donated my copy to our Women's Circle library. This book is a valuable resource and is recommended for those who are taking on serious study."
4,21st Century Easy Listening Music,"I travel internationally alot, so I am always looking for music to play on long flights that is complex yet laid-back yet sophisticated. This one is a winner. There are 40 tunes by various groups, some going back 4 or 5 years, but so what? A great song is a great song no matter how old it is. And the great variety means you can listen over and over and hear something new every time. SPECIAL BONUS: This is probably the best make out music CD set since Avalon by Roxy Music."
2,Disappointing Album More Cheese Than Chill,"I've listened to this album a few times now---I really want to like it but it's just not doing it for me. There are a few good songs, notably ""Romeo"" by Basement Jaxx and a cool track featuring David Byrne, but for what this CD costs, it's not worth it. There are some songs on here that don't make any sense at all--for instance, it has ""Life in Mono"" by Mono--that song came out ages ago; what is it doing on a 2002 compilation? Save your money and go for another compilation. This one is just not very good."
5,Used to set fence posts!,"Bought this to assist in getting fence rows straight. The product worked GREAT! Very pleased with the operation of the unit. We used this product at distances over 500 feet without issue. At 500 feet the instrument is not for precision work, but for setting straight lines it worked fine."
5,Love X Love is a pure listening classic.,"Love X Love is a pure classic song to listen to from the ""GIVE ME TONIGHT"" album. you can sit back and listen to George Benson putting in his best, or you can even dance to its groove. You listen to the words and it just brings you back to that old or new love. I never get tired of listening to it. I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have. check it out!"
5,Simply Awesome,"I only have three albums by George Benson, and while I like them all, Give Me The Night is my favorite. The musicianship is on point, but what else can you expect from the production work of Quincy Jones. My main reason for buying this was the title track, and was surprised to find ""Love X Love"" on here as well. The instrumentals are excellent, namely ""Off Broadway"". This is just plain good music from back in the day, definitely mellow but also romantic and charming. One of the key contributors to this is songwriter Rod Temperton, who wrote five of the album's ten tracks, one of which was ""Star of the Story"", which was first featured on Heatwave's Central Heating album. Not a bad tune on Give Me The Night, and I look forward to listening to more of Benson's library from is 40+ year career."
3,"Good melodrama, mediocre print","The narrative flow of this film is hampered by the device of returning repeatedly to the past, but there are interesting elements, including 4 characters who can't connect with each other. There are campy moments along with more straight-ahead scenes. The dialogue is better than average. Crawford is good, and her dry-mouth effort to talk in the depth of her character's illness foreshadows the way she played the end of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" However, the printed used to prepare the DVD was not in good condition. There are a number of places where you see faded blacks and streaks. At one point, for a couple of minutes, you see little ovals of light all over the screen, almost like reflections from a sparkly bracelet. It's a shame Warner chose not to offer a restored version."
4,A Woman More Obsessed Than Possessed!,"Joan Crawford made a play to become a ""legitimate"" actress with this film. Joan is a woman rejected by a lover played by Van Heflin in a cruel manner. He is simply rejecting of her and isn't caring and tells her so bluntly. Instead of counting him as the jerk he really is, she can't' seem to let go. She marries his wealthy boss after his mentally ill wife dies and becomes more upset when her ex-lover becomes engaged to her step-daughter. Joan's character falls apart allowing her psyche to be explored by numerous doctors. While the movie is intriguing and interesting, I never really enjoyed it. The movie really has no characters to really like. No one is truly bad or good but no one is very likable either. Joan was nominated for an Academy award for this performance but I don't believe she should have won."
4,Djamileh- a forgotten treasure,"This is one of only 2 recordings of this opera. The other - Mercier/Todorovitch/Maurette/Le Roux, is more recent (1999)) but not as good. The piece contains some of Bizets most lyrical music and it is conducted by Gardelli with sensitivity and pace. Popp's creamy soprano gives the title role the warmth required for the opera's only really sympathetic character and Bonisolli tackles the demanding role of Haroun with assurance. LaFont's Splendiano is much better than LeRoux's, which makes too many demands on the latter's baritone. It is really a tenor role. the only pity is that this recording omits much of thte spoken dialogue making the story difficult to follow at times"
3,"Good design, poor protection","This case is designed to fit the camera perfectly. Unfortunately it does not seem to provide protection to the camera aside from scratches.It also features a handy pocket for a spare battery.I would recommend it for style-conscious shoppers but if you are looking to protect your camera from falls or so, this is not the case for you."
2,No good pockets,"I bought this case together with Nikin 5900 digcam. The case looks good and compact. But the main problem is with the pockets. There are two pockets for SD cards in the main pocket and one outer pocket for the battery. The problem is that when you open the case to take the camera, all the pockets are also open and stuff can fall from there. Specially when its on your belt.I won't use this case."
4,Good investment,This is a nice protective case for my Coolpix 5900. I can fit two batteries in the little pouch. The velcro closure is easy to use and the camera fits nicely in the case. It seems to be durable.
3,Quick Review,I got it for my Nikon 5900 but I do have a Canon and I would have to express Canon has better material and make on the camera cases.
4,Great compilation,"There is a variety of sounds - different styles of rapping mixed with different local/tradtional sounds. Several of the artists have socially concious messages, e.g. critique of corrupt institutions."
2,ONLY A FEW KEEPERS HERE,"Much has already been shared about the failings of this album so I won't spend much time on that other than to say that there ARE a 3 or 4 worthwhile songs.The title song, Natalia, Hungry For Your Love and perhaps Kingdom Hall or Santa Fe/Beautiful Obsession, although it's 7 minute length more than wears out it's welcome. (Some of Van's long songs work, others not so much)>Here's an interesting footnote about Santa Fe/Beautiful Obsession that I've never seen anyone point out:BOB SEGER was OBVIOUSLY listening to the song and a few years later swiped the ""Let The Cowboy Ride"" vocal refrain to graft onto the closing moments of ""Against The Wind"". Same phrasing, same song structure on the fade out.......It's a shameless dead ringer.Play 'em back to back sometime!"
3,Uneven album but still has some excellent tracks,"This isn't one of his best albums, but it's still fairly enjoyable. The title track is easily the best thing here - it was a 'hit' single and still gets plenty of FM airplay. The opener, ""Kingdom Hall"" is a rollicking cut, and Van's singing is absolutely euphoric. The sleepers, though, are two low-key but excellent adult love songs: ""Checkin' It Out"" and ""Hungry For You Love.""There are still some enjoyable moments here and there outside of these four songs: even ""Sante Fe"" (which is way too long) has a chorus that does a good job of lifting up the song for about half of its runtime.It's a step up from his previous album, PERIOD OF TRANSITION, but I would check out Van's other albums first before getting this one. The album following this one, INTO THE MUSIC, is one of his best works and a masterpiece; I'd recommend listening to that one first."
5,A Pleasure to Listen to!,"This is a wonderful album.. a pleasure to listen to. No, this is not Moondance nor Astral Weeks, and it wasn't meant to be either. It's Wavelength and very good in it's own right. Give it a listen and you won't be dissapointed. In my opinion, there is only one Van Morrison and this selection is just as much a part of him as any of the other gifts he's left for us to savor. Enjoy."
3,GOOD ALBUM,"""Hungry For your Love"" is the best song on the album. Try to hear the whole album. It is worth buying."
2,mostly horrible,"I agree with the ""Horrible"" review that this album and ""A period of transition"" are the weakest of the early Van recordings, however, I am holding Van to a standard that most artists can't approach. While it is rather light and too pop for my taste I disagree that this album is not worth owning. Like a period..., Wavelength has a couple of tracks that will rock you enough if you really need a Van fix. Buy this album after you have 7 other pre-1980 Van/Them albums."
1,Very poor Van.,"Perhaps Morrison's worst album. It sounds mostly like a rather kitshy, teeniebobber band's effort. No soul, none of the intricacies of his best work. A dud!"
2,Only buy if you have a perverse need to complete collection,".This was recorded before CD's, and times at about 50 minutes (vs. the 74 minutes some artists expanded to with the new format), and it's good it's no longer (kind of like what Johnson said about ""Paradise Lost"": no one ever wished it longer).The songs sound shallow both lyrically (yes, he really wrote ""on a magic night like this, I hunger for your kiss"") and in performance. The band is not his normal band, and comes off sounding like a cold group of session performers, with obligatory this and obligatory that.Many of the songs are padded with nonsense syllable refrains (dum diddy ah diddy ah diddy ah ah... etc).None of these songs make it into greatest hits packages, and I don't recall hearing him do any of them live. (They also haven't made it onto any of his live abums -- at least three since this was recorded.)Morrison does the best he can when singing though, bringing his usual passion, but this is really a forgettable disc."
4,A Soulful Winner,"Released in 1978, ""Wavelength,"" though not amoung Van Morrison's all time best, is still one of his more engaging albums. It takes the basic formula of his classic ""Moondance"" and updates it with longer songs (though admittedly they are one the whole not as strong as ""Moondance""). The album kicks off with the spirited ""Kingdom Hall"" and then moves on to such other excellent tracks as ""Sante Fe/Beautiful Obsession,"" ""Hungry for Your Love,"" ""Venice U.S.A."" and the wonderfully perky title track.Morrison has never sounded better as a vocalist and in retrospect he was just warming up for his late 70s masterpiece ""Into the Music"" that would follow a year later. It should also be noted that the CD booklet includes a full lyrics sheet and a list of backing musicians.Overall, a solid album that stands just a notch or so below Van Morrison's best works."
5,latinodeluxe,"While this album jams and ""Van the Man"" is at his best - he's intense and soulful; you gotta be a chump or on drugs to pay $39 for this CD!!! Do what I did (don't get taken), drive to your nearest Best Buy and pay just $11.99 for a new Remastered copy of Wavelength. Enjoy!!"

Alguien que se respete a sí mismo, y que de vez en cuando piense un poco, buscaría una música que ayude a realizar una vida mas digna y constructiva que ésta, y que ayudara a superar (y no a reforzar) los esteriotipos negativos que tienen de nosotros los latinos.PD: Al fin y al cabo: ¿Que se puede esperar de un disco que se llame ""los anormales""? Bueno, al menos estan concientes de lo que son..."
3,Stunning images encumbered by emotional distance,"As another relative newcomer to Plath/Hughes history, I found myself fascinated by Hughes ability to capture the emotional textures of a relationship. It is fairly obvious there is a self serving quality to these poems, but it is impossible to deny the power within his lines. ""Epiphany"" alone is worth reading this collection, with its stunning imagery of a fox club for sale to an eye opening evaluation of what it takes to be successful in marriage and how he has failed. When it comes to Plath, Hughes is very open in dealing with the two sides of her nature; the beautiful free spirit and the mind that so easily drifted into anger and despair, often in the same poem; but he is far from forthcoming about himself, always keeping an emotional distance from the reader, occasionally allowing a glimpse of his inner being but only enough to move the images along. It is this distance that makes the collection a bit cold despite the heat of Plath's presence."
5,Taking another look,"I have done extensive research on Sylvia Plath. I never saw her as the poor, defenseless victim many feminists portray her as, but reading about her struggles with Ted Hughes did not make him my favorite person. Reading ""Birthday Letters"" was quite a shock for me. The powerful emotions of grief, sorrow, and tenderness cast Mr. Hughes in a new light. I felt almost as if I were intruding on an intimate moment between him and his late wife. I was captivated by this work, but I feel knowledge of his history with Plath is essential for a full understanding of the work."
1,A hoax...,"Yes, there are some great lines - a master like Hughes probably couldn't help himself. But I have to agree with Katha Pollit: the sum of the whole adds up for me as a podium from which to cast self-serving stone after self-serving stone. My most immediate impression is that Hughes has woven the more infamous threads of Plath's poetry with threads of her journals and biographies to create the cloth of a relationship to ""love"" and ""ephiphany"" that is somewhat akin to the emperor's new clothes."
4,Love after death,"I have never really believed that love ends after death and this collection of poems proves my point. With honest emotion, each poem gives the reader a special vantage point into Hughes/Platt's relationship. For anyone who has ever loved with their whole soul...this book is a necessary addition to their collection."
4,the man as poet,"I love Hughes' work, but found the bulk of these poems so obviously personal that I had difficulty finding an 'in' - as opposed to the bulk of Hughes' other work. There are, of course, great exceptions to this, and the one poem 'The Dogs are Eating Your Mother' is worth the entire book. I have never been a Sylvia&Ted'ophile, and couldn't care less for all the chiefly political responses to their relationship - beware particularly of those that require CAPITALS to push their agenda. There are few true men who are poets anymore - poets that are willing to place themselves in the crossfire of manifesto warfare - so Ted's work is also powerful in this regard. The man as poet occupies a strange place in this brave new world, and many will be made uncomfortable."
5,"A moving tribute, although perhaps not great poetry","This volume of poetry, although not ""cutting-edge"" poetic work to which we are accustomed from the UK's poet laureate, is moving, touching, very approachable, and written at a level that a lay-reader can appreciate. I do not believe that Hughes is the ""devil incarnate"" responsible for Sylvia's emotional problems ... some of the other reviewers here are completely hung-up, decades later, on assigning Hughes the responsibility for Plath's suicide (not that she didn't already have some psychological problems going in). How about judging Hughes for his own emotions & literary merit. It's not like he ruined the life of 8 friends, singlehandedly, like Elia Kazan. It's not like he was a rapist, like Arthur Koestler."
2,Not exactly what I wanted.,"I found this DVD to lack motivation. The lack of any background music, combined with the bland voice of the narrarator, affected my perception of this DVD. If a person is wanting a pilates DVD that is fast-paced, and offers multi-leveled workouts, then this is for you. That was what I was seeking when purchasing this, yet I couldn't get past following one student, with no music."
3,What's a Rep and a Set?,This is my first experience with Pilates and the instructions are not clear. I am going to have to email the company to find out what a Set is and how many Reps in a set. Example: Single Leg Stretch 5 - 8 Sets. This doesn't tell you much if you don't know the number of reps in each set. Not worth $20. See [website].
5,Perfect!,"This is perfect! This gave me such a delightful understanding of classical pilates. I recommend this to those seeking good guidance and a realistical goal. Classical Pilates makes it easy to focus with the precise demonstration and consistent narration. It's a peaceful way of combining mental and physical stability. Just after a few days of classical pilates I felt rejuvenated. It's a method that works on your physical being but in the long run, if done correctly, will change your entire persona."
1,Buyer Beware and read the Negative Reviews!,"The positive reviews for this DVD prompted me to buy it. I should have read more of the One Star (or negative) reviews. This is definitely more of an educational tape than a work-out tape. The intructors talk a lot, show you the technique, then perform the technique, but do not do many repetitions or sets. I tried it out once and it is now sitting in it's case."
1,Poor Pilates,"The description says it is for all levels, but it's targeted towards the Advanced Pilates participant. The transitions are fast, as is the workout itself. I am a certified Pilates instructor, and Pilates is supposed to be about performing each excerise with prescision and perfection; the speed of the program does not allow for it. Each workout is only 15 minutes, so if you are looking for a program that you can just pop in and do, this program is not for you."
2,Not really a practice dvd...,"This isn't really a dvd you can practise along to. It's clearly made by real Pilates enthusiasts who know their stuff, but I don't really understand why they produced a dvd; surely most people buy such items to use for home practice? Yet this one doesn't seem to be designed for that at all. It's more like a demonstration or reminder of the sequences. Consequently, I can't help thinking the information contained in it might be better in book form. I appreciate that do do Pilates properly you need to go to a class as the presenters say, but if they don't believe that one can practice at home through dvd, then I really fail to see why this one was made. There is no real instruction and no time is allowed for the viewer to shift position. I have tried to practise along with it, and it's just about possible but not easy or fun, more like a chore. Disappointing. I might check out that 'For Dummies' dvd that some of the other reviewers were talking about."
3,It's nice for what I need it for,"The problem I have with this video is it's not really a ""work out"" video. I purchased this video in the bundle amazon was advertising with the Pilates Circles video (I.E. the pink video to this one) and they both have the exact same exercises. I was a bit disappointed considering if they're sold as a bundle they would consist of different exercises. The problem I had with the actual video is it's more of a narration of what possible pilates moves there are. The exercises are explained in a matter of five or so minutes. On the flip side the exercises do work. However, they are quick to memorize through repition and before long the video isn't even needed."
5,Excellent Pilates workout,"This video gives you straight the classic pilates workout - no dippy super peppy instructors, no irritating music, no adjustments to the already tried and true excellent method of Pilates. The perfect thing for a snowy day when you can't get out of the house!"
4,Is truly classical Pilates but a tad fast (overall excellent),"I had been using these DVD's for a while and then joined a gym where Pilates classes, including reformer, are offered. I ran these recently by my much accomplished Pilates teacher and she was reading the description, etc. and said ""they look like the real thing"". Not the watered down, Mari Winsor version. However, do understand it's really best to learn everything from an accomplished teacher. I never realized all the stuff I was doing ""wrong"" so to speak with the DVD till I took a real class.Having said that, if you don't have access or money to a real class, this is the next best thing."
2,Not for Beginners Who Want to Exercise Along With the DVD,"I was really excited about this DVD, because it earned a communication award, and I thought that meant that it would explain each exercise in detail. But it doesn't AT ALL. It seemed more like a DVD for teachers of pilates, rather than students.I don't even think this DVD is designed to use while you are actually doing the exercises. It shows each exercise once or twice, but there is very little instruction, and they use words like ""powerhouse"" without explaining what that is, or reminding you what it should feel like. AND they go really fast.I don't recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or who hasn't had one-on-one instruction. I've used other instructional DVDs that have been much more helpful."
1,Damaged DVD - Amazon will not accept return or exchange,"We ordered this DVD on the advice of a friend who enjoyed the DVD. Finally, after 3 months, we stopped procrastinating and decided to use the DVD. Upon opening the DVD case and removing the DVD, we noticed a formidable dent on the back of the disc. We were under the impression that the DVD might not even work in a player. Sure enough, our DVD player imeadiately ejected the DVD without even actually starting. We tried to exchange the item, but it was beyond the small return time frame (30 days). Amazon's ""Customer Service"" simply gave us the run-around after a approximately 1 hour conversation. We recommend opening and at least testing items ordered from Amazon or other sellers to avoid this hassle."
2,Boring!,"I wasn't hoping for anything high intensity or overly cheesy, but this is not for me. When I do my DVD's I even turn the sound off on my laptop while I workout and watch my DVR, but even that can't save this one. I have used it once, and it has sat in my DVD pile since. I guess I didn't get too far into it, but I didn't find any unique moves that made me want to come back to it. I prefer the 10 minute solutions pilates workouts so much more. They are basic too, but enough excitement to at least not put me to sleep during my workout. I went right back to those after this one. So much for mixing up my routine."
1,A Mistake to Buy,"I bought this DVD being so excited about continuing my Pilates Path. Dont buy this DVD. The moves are not varied, its boring, and its fast. I am already planning on returing it- and i got it 6 hours ago."
1,"Disappointed. I would have given it 0 stars, but...","the star rater wouldn't let me. I was looking forward to this new DVD and seeing what Pilates was all about. I put the DVD in the player and chose the Basic section just to see what the routines were like. I was TRULY disappointed to find that at least 5 minutes of the section was all this ""talking"" (blab, blab, blab). No pilates routines whatsoever. I got so sick of the yapping that I just took the DVD out and put it back in its case. I'll never buy this series again. What a waste of hard-earned money."
2,I have difficulty in playing the DVD!!!,"I have ordered this DVD a fey days ago, and I recieved it!However, I couldn't play it until now. I had tried some DVD players which could play VOB DVD files, but in vain.I wonder the way to play it on PC, or whether the DVD disc itself has some error!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this DVD and the Shiva Rea yoga Shakti DVD together. This one sucked. If you are looking for a really great workout with almost the same teqnique, buy Shiva Rea yoga Shakti. It has a matrix on the DVD that lets you create your own personlized workout. I saw results from that after two weeks. This Classical pilates DVD is too short, too fast, bad intruction, and boring. I wish I had known. now I'm stuck with it."
5,Just right,"Starts out with a very basic level and moves up. I am not a very coordinated person, but it takes you through the steps without overwhelming you. I've gone through 'Modified Basic' and sticking with 'Basic' for awhile before I move up. The program takes very little time, but I'm seeing progress in my overall body tone."
2,Not for the inexperienced,"I was very excited to order this DVD to further my Pilates Body. I am a bit disappointed. There are little or no instructions on how to do the actual excersize. The whole basis of Pilates Is the the entire positioning of every part of your body including your breathing during each movement. This DVD lacked that. I am fortunate to have taking Pilates before, but for some one just starting out, or has only had a few classes, AVOID THIS DVD. There are some much better DVDs out there for the beginner or even intermediate."
2,Too much hype,"Before I committed to a class, I bought this DVD with the hopes of experiencing true pilates. Unfortunately, the beginner and modified beginner 'routines' were just a few minutes long, with no real workout. The real workout comes with the advanced section, which has no options for the novice. The moves were expertly executed, but there was too much talking. And, the word 'powerhouse' started getting on my nerves."
1,zzzzzzzz,Extremely boring ~ almost sterile ~ basic instructional dvd. I do believe you would get a better workout watching paint dry. But only if you were the one that did the painting.
3,Not what you may think,This is more of an instructional DVD. You can work out to it but it goes a little fast for Pilates.
4,Great for the Initiated,"This is a great video for someone who has had Pilates lessons. The tempo was fast and the details of the positions/postures are not always well explained. It is a great video to work along with if you had at least a few months of private Pilates instructions, preferably from a Guild certified instructor. I have had 7 months of private Pilates instructions (two times a week) and had trouble following the intermediate exercises (I certainly did not venture into the advanced and superadvanced portions). I use this video only to supplement my private lessons and I found it to be a very helpful reminder of certain postures and certain details of some exercises. I would not recommend this to a person who has never had PRIVATE Pilates instruction."
5,quick and to the point,"I don't really have much to compare this dvd to since I have only seen 2 Pilate videos.Although the moves are the same with both videos that I've seen, this one doesn't have alot of talking and wasting of my time. It takes the lady in the other Pilates video I've seen 15-20min to do what it takes the man 5 minutes to do in Classical Pilates.I am still doing the Basic and I am getting better. I still need to work on the breathing techniques before I go onto the Intermediate. I can't see myself ever doing the Super Advanced though! I just don't know if it's natural to be able to bend like that! ha ha"
5,The only Pilates tape I need...,"This is by far the best Pilates technique video on the market, and I have purchased several over the past year. Bob Liekens' instruction is pure gold, and the comments provided by Alycea Ungaro offer great insight into the method. The performances by Peter Fiasca, Junghee Kallander and Jamie Trout clearly illustrate the proper way to do Pilates. All of the exercises are shown from several different angles, and I can easily workout along with the tape. And with all of the levels on one tape, it is the only Pilates tape I need!"
4,Fast and straightforward,"The segments are fast, but easy to follow. It feels a bit short (can you really get a workout in 7-12 minutes???) but the exercises are challenging. Overall an enjoyable and straightforward video with no frills."
4,Good but short,"I really like this video. I have been doing pilaties for about 9 years and it is difficult to find a video that suits me. The only reason this video doesnt get 5 stars is because I would like to at least have the option for a longer workout. Each of the segments I have done are only 15 min. The video does get a lot of work into that 15 min. So you have to be prepared to move quick. But really that is great...and usually one of my biggest complaints about other videos. Having so much time inbetween sets only allows your heart rate to lower. Overall, great video."
1,NOT what I expected,"I just re-sold this dvd and I say good riddance! When I first viewed the dvd, I thought each segment was just a preview and then they were going to go back and go through a class. All of a sudden, they were in a boring discussion group and it was over. So disappointing. No instruction, just coaching with quick, minimal reps. It's also a pain to have to go through the dvd to find the segment that you wanted for just a few minutes of pilates. With a lot of filler in the beginning of useless information and a ... disucssion at the end, the actual pilates time in the middle is minimal. As a pilates and yoga instructor, I was extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money!"
4,Comprehensive,I like this DVD because it goes from beginner to advanced and doesn't require additional purchases. I find the explanation of when you should move on to the next level to be lacking clarity. The main downside of this DVD is that compared to other fitness titles it's just really boring. I don't find that any of the people teaching or being interviewed are very motivating speakers.
2,Disappointing,"I was completely new to Pilates when I tried this DVD. I didn't know what to expect but had read very good reviews of it from other Amazon customers. I was very disappointed that I spent the $25.00. The audio on this DVD is very poor. I had to turn the volume up very high, and there was a good deal of static. The beginner sections are not a very good follow-along workout. They don't go into much detail on how to perform the moves correctly, and the workout is less than five minutes, although they tell you to do it for 10 minutes. I got bored and frustrated before I advanced to the more difficult sections. It sure does work your abs, though!"
1,Bad instructions and very short workouts,"I agree with the reviewer who said this is more like a Documentary than an instructional DVD. The segments are very short, being only around 10 minutes long and minimal instructions are given. I guess this DVD would be good if the user is looking to bring new ideas to the gym but defiantly not for a home workout. I'm highly disappointed."
3,Not for beginners,This dvd moves too fast and does not provide enough instruction to beginners. The narrator does not explain how to do the moves properly and does not speak to the user so that you know when all the transitions are occurring. I find myself having to watch the TV while I am doing the exercises which is not good! I would not recommend this DVD. The guy's voice is really annoying too.
2,Perfect for Advanced Dancing Students,"Excellent for advanced dancing students. It is difficult to do all the exercise with the instructor because it is too fast, but have all the standard pilates exercises. If you prefer to follow the instructor's direction, I would recommend ""The Method Pilates - Precision Toning and Sculpting""."
1,no instruction at all,"this is not a good dvd at all unless you are a professional pilates person, and then why would you need a dvd? it gives absolutely not instruction and goes so quickly, it's unbelievable."
2,Waist constricts and size much different than the cotton,Was a waste of money buying these. I like the cotton version so ordered the same size in the microfiber but they are much smaller and the waist cuts in which is neither attractive or comfortable. Jockey needs to size their products more consistently.
3,Cheap Cushions,"These cushions are OK for the price. They fulfill the Type 4 PFD requirement and last about 2 years.I would like to have better, long lasting ones, but, they get pretty expensive"
5,Bob Mackie's Doll,"Like all Bob Mackie dolls, this one is beautiful. Once my wife saw it, she had to have the Goddess of the Moon Barbie and as always I bought it for her. She loves it!"
5,Midsummer Night'ss Dream,Excellent reissue complete with original line notes. Will look to ArkivMusic in the future for CD reissues.
4,"Good, but not Winters Bone","the author is dead on with his creation of these kind of characters. I live close enough to West Table to recognize the type. the storyline is a little disconnected,but it gets you where he wants you"
3,Great Service...not my favorite Woodrell book,"I appreciated the seller's price and good service in getting the book to me quickly. Once I had it, though, I found it was not my favorite Woodrell book. While it had the Woodrell wacky characters and uncomfortable twists, it lacked the spark and dark humor of others of his works I have enjoyed."
3,"Solid Use of Language, The Story is Lacking","Woodrell's use of language and surreal imagery wasn't enough to sustain my interest. I know the Ozarks very well so I was familiar with the world he creates and populates -- it definitely rings true.However, the problem I had with the book is I wasn't sure where the story was going, and then I wasn't sure that I cared because the language distracted from the characterization and the sense of place."
2,"Witty writing, stupid subject matter, and silly ending","TOMATO RED is a little wittier than WINTER'S BONE, and equally depressing. As a lifelong MO resident I'm sure these characters exist in some form, but they would in any city or state. Poor MO, the left and right coasts probably think there's nothing good in fly-over land. I didn't appreciate the smuttiness, although, I know, that's life, but it could have been handled obliquely. I don't know what the fascination is with a window or microscope into the hopeless lives of people in general. Do we learn anything about the characters? No. It's sinful human nature acting like human nature. We can all imagine or experience it. If writing has a purpose there should be some redeeming quality to it, at least an ending without such a loose end...it was like falling off a cliff. I'm sure there are grand pubas of literature who fawn over this stuff, but it was probably a waste of my time."
3,Extremely disappointing ending,"I'm not often tempted to write reviews, but I was so disappointed with the way this novel ended that I felt compelled to write this. I've read three other novels by Woodrell (Give Us a Kiss, Winter's Bone, and Woe to Live on) and really enjoy his style. The language in Tomato Red is as humorous and original as any of his other works, and the characters are well-drawn, but the ending is just terrible. No real resolution and the protagonist's final act was, to me, out of character. Really strange, almost like Woodrell just wanted to get it over with. On a ten-point scale, I'd give this a 6."
2,"Such a fuss about the author's ""ear""","I was disappointed with this book. The New Yorker gave it a rave review, and yes, Woodrell has a way with dialect. It just wasn't enough. I'll stick with Kaye Gibbons - thanks."
4,An excellent read,"In Tomato Red, Daniel Woodrell knows of where pre-destiny is set. Genetic reception, one's geographical point of entry/nourishment, and the expectations of those who know these things about you: parents, friends, teachers and those who live on the fringe and observe you from their vantage point are all parts of the final resting place of one's existence and soul. Sometimes, one escapes the doldrums of such whitetrash existence and pre-determined endings; but in Jamalee's case, tragedy follows her escape like the dust which follows her bus. A top-knotch read for anyone interested in excellent wordsmithing."
1,Trashy book about trashy people,I thought this short book was terrible. The characters were unattractive and crude. I forced myself to read the whole book because a friend wanted me to read it and because I kept thinking that something was going to happen. Nothing of consequence did. I ordered this book off of Amazon.com. It was a waste of money.
1,Disappointing,"I have extremely enjoyed Mr. Redbone's On the Track and Double Time Albums over the years.I fail to understand why the other reviewers of Champage Charlie find it to be so outstandingTo begin with the Champagne Charlie song is quite lame melodically, likewise the lyrics are marginal ...I just got the Branch to Branch Album and it definitely seems a lot more inspired than Champagne Charlie ..."
4,A Classic western!,"Ross Phillips rode north from Santa Fe at the head of a wagon train carrying a million dollars in gold bullion. He was charged with getting the bullion to Red River and establishing a new trade route through the Comanche-infested wilderness. Ross fought hunger, cold, and thirst. But he came to a dead halt when he came up against Comanche chief Muke-war-rah. The chief held white captives -- all women -- and one of them had saved Ross Phillips's life."
4,Beautiful and moving,"This is a beautiful recording. Although Fischer-Dieskau is past his prime, I found i could still tolerate his vocal flaws (he is a truly great artist) and enjoy the performance thoroughly. Beautifully recorded orchestra, Helen Donath stealing the show, and very thoughtful and intelligent performances from Varaday and the rest. No major problems; it feels like a breath of fresh air. Recommended!"
3,SHUT UP. PETE.,"This CD easily could have been one of my favorite blue note mix tapes, but Pete Rock really messed up here. As other reviewers stated already, Pete Rock gives shout-outs to his record label, and his fans in Japan every 3 minutes. Also, you get to hear Rich Mason and Pete Rock giving props to each other every 5 minutes. It's really ironic that Pete Rock is the one behind the production, but at same time he also ruins the total experience with this so-annoying dumb shout outs. i love pete rock but this time i found myself keep yelling : Shut your mouth, Pete. i'm trying to enjoy music here."" overall, this CD feels more like a free radio station blue note mix. in other words, unless you have to collect everything that's done by pete Rock, (even though he did very little in here) it ain't worth $38 bucks."
5,Safe Coping,"I bought this jig shortly after attempting to Cop without one (Still have 10 fingers). Now, I'd never Cop without the work firmly secured in a Quality jig.This was my first Woodhaven tool. Since then I've become a big Woodhaven fan.Woodhaven tools are always very simple and understated. At the same time the precision and Quality are first rate. The tools always perform perfectly.The aluminum Fence and clamp on the 528 jig holds the work very securly. The 1/2"" black phoenolic base is thick and does not flex at all. The Miter bar is adjustable to eliminate any slop. All the machining is first rate. A very impressive Coping Sled.Don't be caught dead without this sled."
4,Good Quality as Expected,"Quality was as expected. nice housing. Only problem was the 3/8"" bit was missing from the set. Box appeared sealed. I just purchased a replacement instaed of going through the return process."
3,Missing a piece from the picture,The PCV Valve is fine. What they fail to mention is that the Elbow grommet that attaches to it is NOT included. The only reason I ordered this was for the Elbow Grommet yet it wasn't included.
1,Not as advertised!,"This book is totally void of useful details and long on unexplained jargon and the author's personal promotion of the use of marked sticks (which he calls ""story poles"") instead of a tape measure. Also, he dwells almost exclusively upon promoting European cabinet hardware---rather than traditional American hardware, as the title would lead one to expect. I plan to ask for a refund. Save your money folks."
5,Gorgeous,"Emmylou's sweet and twangy voice, Tony Rice, Albert Lee, Ricky Skaggs...how could this be anything but rich and beautiful? It tugs at the heart like good bluegrass should.If in doubt, try Wayfaring Stranger. If that song doesn't do it for you, this album isn't for you. But it should be."
5,Perhaps Emmylou's finest album,"It was a risky move in 1980. To release an album of bluegrass was not exactly the way to go about selling records, and Emmylou's record company knew it. So, they were a bit hesitant to release ""Roses In The Snow."" It is a good thing they relented, as this is probably the best album of Emmylou's career.From the heartbreaking opening fiddle of the title track which kicks off the album, to the sumptuous harmonies and mandolins that close out its final number ""Gold Watch and Chain"" this is an album of unquestionably beautiful music. In between is no different. ""Wayfaring Stranger"" still haunts. ""Green Pastures"" and ""Jordan"" are rousing spirituals. The list goes on. Real, passionate, and unforgettable.Emmylou had the last laugh to. After its release in 1980, it became, much to her record companies surprise, her fastest selling album to date."
4,Better than Fiction,"Friendly provides an excellent, eye level review of this momentus battle that opened the gates of Asia Minor and eventually Europe itself to the conquering hords of Turks. He establishes the scene well, overview of the Byzantine and Seljuk Turkish politics and culture was excellent. Given he is not a professional historian, he does an excellent job and use of key references to expose these topics that are so poorly covered in literature. Historical impact, reaction in Middle East and Europe to this famous battle has been presented well. He has evaluated the tactics and strategy in a lot more detail then the generals on either side almost. Topic is rather narrow but for the history buff full of good stuff."
5,"I happen to like Xena uber, thank you very much.","Xena online fanfic, esp. of the ""uber"" or 'real world' variety featuring incarnations of our heroines (based on the characterizations and physical attributes of the actresses who brought Xena and Gabrielle to life) has totally revitalized lesbian romantic literature and the feminist press publishing business. Thank the goddess for it. This happens to be one of the best of the lot because the author is a superb writer and storyteller. The newsroom milieu, the golf world milieu and the lesbian love story (the guarded, hardass Xena uber newsroom boss falls for her necessarily closeted on air talent, the accident prone, adorable Gab uber tv reporter) all ring very true. I just hope she gets around to finishing the sequel which is also posted online."
5,A good read,"I finished the book over a weekend. It was very entertaining and gave me some interesting insight into the world of news broadcasting and golf. While I tend to question story lines that center around boss and subordinate business relationships turning into romance, Maggie Ryan does a good job of balancing the issues. The story line and character development is very good, I found myself liking Kaz and Chris alot, as well as a few of their friends. I recommend ""The Deal"" to anyone who likes the Xena fan fiction genre."
1,Not for PSP 3000,"Those guys should say before this item doesn't fit with PSP 3000. Sounds great but you have to use the aux only, you can't put your PSP into the sound station.Don't buy it if you have a 3000. Don't make same mistake as me."
3,PSP Psyclone Nodus Sound System,"Well I enjoy playing on the road since I am a Truck Driver. I thought about buying another PS3 and taken my old PS3 with me so when I stop at a truck stop that has a system like IdleAire I would be getting onto the internet.Well I thought it does have a great sound but it didn't mention that the new PSP's like the 2000's. You can only hook it to the AUX, which is great but I am going to keep it cause plugging it in my AC/DC tv makes me have great sound. This is more for the yearly versions of the PSP's. It should have stated that fact. So I will keep looking for a hook up for the PSP Models 2000's."
1,"NOT WORTH A PENNY! I'D GIVE IT A ZERO STAR RATING, IF I COULD!","If I had wanted a book of poetry I would've bought something from Frost, Emerson, or Dickinson, not some unknown author that had a really ""bad"" idea of having people write poems, or ""short stories"" about the Jonestown tragedy! Yeah it was sad, but I wanted the hard facts about who, what, when, where, and why this happened, not some crappy prose. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Sorry if you were one of the contributors of this book, but really it sucked! The title was especially misleading! I thought I was getting some great book about what happened!"
1,Silenced forever,"I was sincerely ready to read a cozy mystery from an author referred to me by several members of my cozy groups. I checked this out of the library on CD and began in ernest to enjoy a cozy mystery, so I thought.That ended with the first disc. Although the author can write and write well ...this is the furthest type of book I would ever choose to read or listen to. Just the thought of a vulnerable child being molested and murdered makes my skin crawl.I am giving this author another chance but only with her other cozy mystery-Dorothy Martin series.I definitely did not recommend this book to either of my cozy readers group.Ellen"
2,A Sorry Disappointment,"Having read the Dorothy Martin series, I was fully prepared to enjoy this book, but I didn't - not at all. Hilda, the protagonist, is impossible to like and, therefore, care much about. She prides herself on her ability as a liar, and her personality is harsh and domineering. Her little brother's an incorrigible brat, making it difficult to maintain any sympathy for him and his plight. The storyline is contrived and confusing. The cast of characters, except for the Irish swain, don't ring true; and the evocation of the historical period is the only saving grace. Back to Dorothy Martin, a heroine it's possible to like!"
1,Thumbs down!,"This is ridiculous! Packaging lame 90's Gang Green with their best release, ""Another Wasted Night"". Just go buy ""Another Wasted Night"" for less money."
1,"This ""Party"" should have been cancelled BEFORE it began!","Mario Van Peebles should be THOROUGHLY ashamed of himself for this scurrilous, misogynistic dreck. I would write a more detailed description, but I figure I shouldn't waste anymore time on writing about it as I did watching it...as I struggled through about 40 minutes before cutting it off. Those looking for a modern take on ""House Party"" should keep right on looking.A VHS version of ""House Party"" is FAR superior to this High-Definition disaster."
4,Answernig God,"A book about how to read the Psalms and about what constitutes prayer.Using the Psalms as a guide to genuine praying.Fresh new ideas, challenging perhaps set styles of praying. Encourages honesty in prayer and not just formulas.Am still only half way through but find it very helpful so far."
3,Disapointing,"This book was just disappointing. I have come to love Eugene Peterson, but this book was not his typical stuff. The sentence structures of a lot of sentences make for a difficult read. some of it is fairly rudimentary. Overall, skip it."
1,Waste your money more profitably on something else.,"Poorly written, poorly reasoned, largely irrelevant to the thesis implied in the title. As a senior thesis it would deserve a passing grade only at the least demanding of colleges (Walden, perhaps). There are a few worthwhile tidbits, but not enough to justify the price. One might use it as an up-to-date illustration of White's ""two cultures"" hypothesis. It is also not large enough to serve as an effective doorstop."
3,Unfocused but decent overview,Reading this book was like listening to a history professor's lecture. The author wants to make a particular point but can't help but go down several different tangents while in the process. Eventually the author comes back on messaage but leaves you a bit confused in the end as to what that message actually was.The author does make some interesting historical points as well as introducing some theories on the black death that most might be unfamiliar with.At times this book is tedious and sloppy while other times it is highly interesting and you want to see where he is trying to take you.I picked this up in an airport bookshop prior to leaving for Thailand. I probably would not have finished reading it had I been in a normal situation but as I was on a flight I had nothing else to do.I would recommend reading other books on the subject but if this is all you have it would not be a complete waste of time and would be somewhat interesting.
1,Dreadful,After 50 pages I decided I was wasting my time. Tossed it. Got tired of aimless digressions and banal allusions to current events.
1,Sloppy and casual,"This seems more like a casual re-hash of some medieval anecdotes than a well organized book. Cantor also spends as almost much time on irrelevant asides about his views on current fashion and politics as on epidemiology. Aside from the introduction (worth reading), there is not much here."
2,Disappointing,"Not up to the standard of Cantor's other books. Lack of focus. Scattered errors. Enough to shake me from my enjoyment of the book and make me doubt many of his statements and conclusions.* Unlikely claims, such as this: French crossbowman at Crecy took half an hour to reload, with an assistant.* Strained connections, such as this: The brutal murder of Edward II ""reflected the general malaise, anger, and pessimism of the new age of global cooling.""* Incomplete thoughts, such as this: ""There was a sharp dividing line between the landholding wealthier peasants, who experienced a cyclic boom and bust in their lifetime -- sometimes eating well on something approaching a gentry diet and at other times struggling to fill their stomachs with just about any cereal or scraps of ... meat they could find.""* Obvious errors, such as labelling an etching as ""fourteenth century,"" when the style, detail, and perspective make it look at least 200 years older."
1,Pretty Thin Gruel!,"This book was a major disappointment. Prof. Cantor has an excellent reputation as a medievalist, and I had long hoped he would turn his energies to the plague. But what we have here is a very disappointing and poorly written book. I could tell within about 5 pages that this book would be sub-standard. Avoid this book as if it were a plague-infected corpse!"
1,This guy should be professor of comedy,"He's really funny. Check this out; ""The biomedical devastation had a strange and complex impact on the Church. It may have reinforced a trend away from optimism to pessimism..."". See what I mean ? That's beautiful. Woody Allen eat your heart out.He educates us with authority and certainty about some ""remarkable mystical text"" as follows: ""A reasonable guess would attribute authorship to some Carthusian monk."" No kidding.Every page has similar hidden delights.Apart from the ""This is Spinal Tap"" appeal, this book should be mandatory reading in History classes to teach kids how to read critically."
1,A Hoosier professor,"The opening part of the book is interesting. The rest of it is inexplicable. On one hand, the attempts at humor are hard to square with the seriousness of the situations that these people faced. On the other hand, the attempts at humor are also primarily at the expense of Christ, Christianity, Christians, and conservatives. (How the author could possibly know Margaret Thatcher's thoughts about the 14th and 15th centuries is hard to figure, for instance.) About midway through, I got tired of the snideness and threw the book away. It was clearly going to be the same tired remarks over and over again, even though there were bits of interesting history buried under them. My recommendation: Do not buy this book."
1,Cheap history,"I have to agree with the other (negative) reviews of this book. I was highly disappointed with the complete and utter lack of scholarship within the book, the numerous factual mistakes, and in particular, Cantor's axe-grinding against the undemocratic actions of 14th century monarchs. This is not the place for Professor Cantor to wax lyrical about our enlightened democracy, or to opine about the British monarchy of today as symptomatic of the degraded, arrogant culture of Europe in general. If he wanted to write a book about such things, publish it as an opinion piece, not falsely wrapped as a historical study."
2,negative reaction from book club,"no one in my book group liked this book. They thought it was rambling, inaccurate, and not well edited. Since the author was quite elderly and passed away a few years later, the group thought this might have been the reason."
1,"Poorly Written, Inaccurate, and Boring","I would strongly recommend against purchasing this book. I am very disappointed in it. Not only does it make an uninteresting and rambling read, the facts are questionable at best, biased and inaccurate at worst. It's neither a factual history nor an interesting fiction."
3,it's not that bad...,"A wonderful, albeit brief, introduction to the world of 14th century Europe. Written in an engaging and imformative style, Norman Cantor manages to paint individual lives effected by the Plague with wonderfully vivid detail. Obviously not for medievalists, as it is certainly short on details but good for anyone interested in history."
1,A question,"Is ther any actual proof that there are more Eurpoean people who are immune to the HIV virus (or the 'AIDS disease' as Cantor puts it), because their ancestors had natural immunity to, or (obviously) survived, the plague? Can plague, which is bacterial, have any baring on peoples' immunity to a virus? I've never heard this before? Presumably it's being posited as a reason Europe is not as badly afflicted as Asia and Africa?"
2,In the Wake of the Plague,"If you are searching for detailed scientific information on the way the disease worked on the body, how it spread from person to person, description of its physical affects on the body, then this is absolutely NOT the book for YOU.The author only mentions this kind of information briefly and he skips around.The book is more about how the world was before and after the plague not about the plague itself."
2,Informative but a little boring.....,"I found this book filled with information about the plague, but it was not precisely what one would expect in a book touted as such. I did not quite get the connection that the author first alludes to in the first few pages. The author claims he will show how bioterrorism may very well be our worst concern by the end of this President's term, yet mentions very little to support the plausability of this statement. Then too, we have the author's underlying (seeming) arrogance, curt remarks on other authors and such. Not a page turner for sure, and the Plague is such an interesting subject that it is a shame this book could not have picked up on that point and elaborated. I found it dry, and I gave it two stars for it's information and it's (thankfully) brevity. I truly did expect more of a connection with today's world and felt cheated."
2,Disappointing,"I must agree with a number of other reviewers: Cantor gives many interesting facts, but it's very poorly written and edited."
1,Snarky,"What more can be said - boring, repetitious, poorly written. Cantor tries to make snarky, ""clever"" comments to appear to be ""contemporary."" Fail!"
1,The most poorly written book I have ever read.,This is the only book I have started and decided I could no longer read. It is the most poorly written book I have ever come across - and I read a lot. Life is too short to waste on writing like this: unless you're a high school teacher grading a junior history essay.
1,Not worth the time nor the money,"This book reads more like a collection of randomly assembled notes than a historical treatise. The narrative wanders over more than a millennium and tries to embrace cultural, religious, and biomedical history within the space of 200 pages. It does not succeed in any aim. I was frankly astounded that the author, who enjoys a good reputation as a historian of the Medieval period, would put his name to such a poorly executed effort.This was not worth the time nor the money."
2,What a disappointment!,"I'm truly sorry to have spent as much as I did on this book. It does contain quite a lot of information, yes, but it's organized so poorly and written in such awkward prose that its impact is severely diminished. I was particularly annoyed that a medievalist of such reputation didn't do a little more research on the ""Ring around a rosy"" rhyme, but confidently states the old myth about its origins as fact. ....In short,I'd say that you're much better off rereading Tuchman than buying this book, unless you collect interesting jacket art."
3,Not meant to be a textbook,"I think what most people don't realise is that this book is designed as a springboard for research. This is meant to be read by those who don't know very much about the plague. Cantor makes a good point of expressing the magnitude of the importance of the black death throughout the book. The book also has quite a number of pages of suggested reading. It is important to note that it is not a bibliography, it is listed as suggested reading. This book will serve you well if you've decided that the plague interests you but you don't know much beyond perhaps what you've learnt in class. For me it has pointed me in the right direction and helped to organize the vast volume of available material that Cantor lists into categories of usefulness."
5,A cultural view.,"If you are looking for scientific fact on the plague, its causative agent, etc., then this is not the book for you. However, if you are interested in history and culture, then this is an excellent book. It shows how the devastation of the plague affected all strata of society, including the rich, poor, clergy, royalty, and so on.I found that I could not put this book down. This is a very large and complicated topic, but this book gives a great overview with some very specific examples. It also gives examples of how the plague shaped society from the 1300s until today."
1,left wing history,"Cantor has a nice prose style and writes here on a fascinating subject, an era whose effects are undoubtedly still being felt.However there is a constant undercurrent of left wing philosophy throughout the entire book, at least to the approximate halfway point which is where I gave up. Cantor actually uses phrases such as ""communist workers' paradise,"" which he apparently hoped the serfs of the middle ages would have attained. He even, strangely, finds time to disparage Margaret Thatcher, which lets you know pretty clearly that the black plague may not be the real point of this book.Quite frankly, I see the ugly little tome as a disguised attempt to push socialism. I am therefore somewhat resentful at having paid money for something other than what I thought I was buying."
3,"Okay, but not great...","This was a decent book, but not at all what I expected. I'm reading another book on the Plague right now, that's flowing a lot better. Like some other people have mentioned, this book is taking on too many ideas at once and not going into enough depth with any of them. The author brings up a number of interesting points, but ends up passing over these points. He also has a tendency to hop back and forth between similar topics, not connecting points clearly."
2,"Interesting Subject, pedantic writing","This was a very interesting and timely subject, unfortunately, the writing didn't hold up to the level of interest. The chapters are repetative and it seems like they just cut and pasted some key phrases -- for example, every time they referred to the ""buboes"" (a tell tale sign of bubonic plague)...they had to include the line buboes - those black welts under the arms and groin that are usually a sign of bubonic plague....this continued well into the end of the book, by then they should have expected the reader to have gotten the explanation. There are numerous examples of this type of thing and it made reading the book a lot like reading a text book and quite boring."
2,Disappointing,"Not up to the standard of Cantor's other books. Lack of focus. Scattered errors. Enough to shake me from my enjoyment of the book and make me doubt many of his statements and conclusions.* Unlikely claims, such as this: French crossbowman at Crecy took half an hour to reload, with an assistant.* Strained connections, such as this: The brutal murder of Edward II ""reflected the general malaise, anger, and pessimism of the new age of global cooling.""* Incomplete thoughts, such as this: ""There was a sharp dividing line between the landholding wealthier peasants, who experienced a cyclic boom and bust in their lifetime -- sometimes eating well on something approaching a gentry diet and at other times struggling to fill their stomachs with just about any cereal or scraps of cheap meat they could find.""* Obvious errors, such as labelling an etching as ""fourteenth century,"" when the style, detail, and perspective make it look at least 200 years older."
1,I had to put it down!,"I bought this book without reading the Amazon reader reviews and I am so sorry that I did. The book is so badly edited that I just could not stand it. In reading the reviews on the inside cover of the book, I wondered if any of these ""Reviewers"" actually read the book! It reads as a first draft rather than a finished product. This was my first book (or should I say half a book) by Mr. Cantor and it will be my last."
1,"Sarcastic, superficial, unscholarly, and inaccurate book","As a lover of Medieval history, I was excited to read this book, especially since my ancestors are included as one of the families mentioned in ""Women and Men of Property."" My anticipation and excitement quickly turned to disappointment and disgust. The sarcastic, cynical, and disturbing writing style is bad enough, but the mocking cruelness, and the numerous inaccuracies involved in trying to portray these families is unforgivable. The anti-nobility stance is monotonous. One wonders where all this hatred is coming from. This book is not scholarly, intelligent or informative. Avoid it like the proverbial plague!!!"
2,Mixed Feelings about this book,"Norman Cantor's ""In the Wake of the Plague"" is rather an interesting read yet my feelings on this were mixed. With only ten chapters and roughly 220 pages, this book can be a useful work for the study of the Black Death due to its use of secondary researches and bibliography. However, it seems to be a bit unreadable and rather a subjective written.While I was intrigued with his use of secondary sources and his discussion in ""Knowing About the Black Death"" section, I was rather put off or confused by his writing style throughout this book, and I was not quite sure what conclusion(s) he was relating to the readers.While the author made some interesting points throughout the book, I was getting the impression that he wrote this book in a hurry."
2,"Ok History, Bad Science","Cantor's book, while an extremely interesting for its historical insights, (for instance, how the Plague may have spured the Renaissance) falls short in the area of science. He seems to have little grasp of vector-borne diseases and cycles of infection. He throws in irrelevant scientific references with little idea of their real value.I would recommend this book to people wanting a greater understanding of the historical and social impact that the Black Death made, but I would not recommend this book to someone wanting to understand infectious disease transmission or the nature of the plague in particular."
2,A disappointment,"I read about this book in the Chronicle of Higher Education and was eager to read it. My anticipation unfortunately made the letdown all the worse.While there is interesting information in the book, I finished it without any clear sense for Cantor's argument; that is, I wasn't sure what his point was. The book seemed more a cobbled-together pile of information than a coherent story.Anyone treading this path has a hard act to follow; Tuchman's A Distant Mirror is still the supreme popular work on the period. I had hoped Cantor would at least come close; to my disappointment, he did not."
1,Good Editor Wanted!,"I had high hopes of an absorbing book as a companion to my Camus, but this one didn't absorb -- in fact I couldn't get through the whole thing. It is disjointed and repetitive."
1,In the Wake of the Plague,"Riddled with errors. His cosmic dust comments--why not an X-Files script instead? It raises questions about the editors named in his acknowledgments. With many excellent publications on the topic and research now probing microbial evidence, it does a disservice to historical research and to the publishing industry that accepted his manuscript."
1,"If this book was edited, somebody needs to be fired.","There are so many more well written books about the Black Plague. This one stinks. Any editor worth his salt would have slashed through Cantor's extraneous, anachronistic, distracting and banal comments. Save your money!"
3,AP World History Review,"In The Wake of the Plague: the Black Death and the World it Made is a facinating book that details the life in Medieval Europe and the scientific aspect of black death. Cantor talks about how not only was the Black Death responsible for the plague, but also how anthrax played a role in it as well.While Cantor weaves a illuminating tale about the plague of the Middle Ages, he jumps between stories and makes the book a little confusing and tangled. Truely, though, a gripping story that makes a lot of sense."
2,Not the Best Medical Historian,"The book itself is not bad when it gets to more of the social history after the plague. However, the medical history part is a little shoddy, with the author misusing terms, referencing some questionable obscure sources to make his point, and making some assumptions that should not be made. As a source of medical history I could never in good conscious recommend this book, as its not a very accurate depiction."
2,Where oh where was the editor?,"The book was a somewhat enjoyable read, but I think the unedited version must have gone to the printers. I thought perhaps that a high school student wrote this so poor was the writing / grammar. NYTimes Bestseller - well, people will buy anything.I found the editorializing comments towards religious people of the time to be condescending and distracting."
3,Some explanations on the Black Plague.,"I didn't think this was a great book but it did give me some knowledge of how terrible the Black Plague and the terrible effects on Europe and Asia. It really decimated the populations of Western Europe, almost to the point where civilization was at stake. Cantor describes it as the modern day example of the atom bomb. Cantor does some theorizing about the origin and the fact that the plague may have also been anthrax, and not the plague spread by rats. He also theorizes what might have happened if the plague had not been. Society and civilization may have developed faster, rather than recover from the population loss.This is an OK read, and I learned something from Cantor's writings. I am surprised others have rated this book so low, because it did give a side of the Black Plague that is rarely written about."
2,Not at all what I expected,"This was quite a disappointing book. The one positive aspect of the book: there is plenty of information on the social, cultural, economic, religious, and intellectual climate of the 14th century. Unfortunately, the information is hopelessly scattered throughout the book without much organizing principle at all. It's a sloppy stream-of-conscious collection. 1) his conclusions are scattered pell-mell thoughout the text, 2) there is no logical procession of his argument, 3) his bias is very apparent in certain passages (especially when discussing the nobility), 4) in his infinte pedantry, he sticks in random pieces of information that have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the argument he is making (that is, to the degree he is making a clear argument at all), and 5) details of the plague are often mentioned in passing. The book is a decent collection of random facts - not much else."
2,"Disappointing, Misleading","Cantor's discussion of the origins and impact of the plague is, at best, cursory. This book reads more like a series of case studies of medieval persons - an archbishop, a wealthy family, a princess. The case studies have the common thread of persons dying of the plague. However, Cantor uses this as a pretext to discuss - in colorful detail - the lives, achievements and ideologies of these persons. For example, I found the discussion about Aristotlean and Thomist logic distracting and irrelevant to the plague. This is a readable introduction to medieval England (the case studies are predominantly English), but certainly not an enlightening discussion of the plague phenomenon."
2,Medieval-like writing,"Dr. Cantor is a medievalist, and writes in the style of his subjects: very rambling, with a tendency to ramify tediously so he can talk at length about what he finds interesting, whether or not it is relevant. Some good information, some mistakes even a non-scholar reader like me could spot. Not a lot about the plague. Some peculiar theories. What seems to me a misapplication of 20th-century terminology to 14th-century groups (for instance, what sounds like raiders or harriers, he calls terrorists)."
5,History=MyStory,"As a history teacher, one of the most confusing units for students of history and students forced to study history is Medieval Europe.Cantor does an excellent job presenting Europe in a narrative fashion that is easy for the reader to understand and to relate to, while at the same time discussing the effects the plague had on European population.This book is a must read for those who want to know more about... Medieval Europe or the Plague.Happy Reading!!!"
1,One cent books don't happen,"This is the second time I have ordered a one cent book form a seller on Amazon and the second time they have said they shipped the book and it never arrived. To be fair, my cent and the postage were refunded both times. But I have to start all over again looking for my book and it just isn't worth the aggravation. I am disappointed as all my other dealings with Amazon have been exemplary and I have been very satisfied. By the way, the actual book is great. You will be surprised how the black plague affected the following centuries. Get it somewhere."
3,"Easy read, if somewhat jumbled","I bought this book at the airport in Boston and found it appropriate as an ""airport book."" On a late night flight, it was entertaining but not intense. Nor was it well organized. The end of the book abruptly stops with comments about Chaucer rather than a summing up of the main thesis. One gets the impression of an erudite academician, late in life, with lots to say but very little energy to say it in an organized way. Some of the errors are obvious, even to someone with only surface knowledge of the period. For example, he states somewhere in the book that Constantinople fell in the 14th century rather than in 1453. But for all that .. it is a quick read and can be considered as something like a ""bathroom reader"" -- full of interesting tid bits but without much of a unifying thread. His earlier books were much better organized. Maybe he just needs to take a vacation. I'd recommend it as a airplane or beach book (aka ""history lite"")."
2,Not really about the Plague,"The author spends very little time discussing the actual plague, but instead focuses on life before, during and after the plague in Northern Europe. This is ok, but not what I expected. He also has the nasty habit of presenting his opinions as facts and not even backing them up with relevant references. It gets old fast."
4,Fascinating book,I enjoyed this book immensely. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an interesting introduction to the Black Plague and the effect it had on the people of the Middle Ages. I have read the other reviews that are not favorable. I think this is because they have a much broader knowledge on this period of time. This book tells the beginner just what they need to know to get a sense of life in these times. I found it intriging to the extent that I now want to read other books on the Middle Ages. So I would say Norman Cantor did his job in getting me interested in reading more.
2,Disappointment,I was very disappointed by this book. I had high hopes based on some reviews I read elsewhere. What some describe as a readable style I found to be very annoying. There are constant tangents and digressions along with weirdly out of place references and descriptions (He describes Princess Joan as a 'top-drawer white girl). There are many anecdotes in the work that I found interesting but the constant bouncing around killed it. Reading sections of this book is like driving over literary speed bumps.I would recommend instead of this book Barbara Tuchman's 'A distant Mirror'
1,"Make Up Your Facts as You Go Along, Why Don't You?","Yes. This is strewn with errors like a mine-field is with mines. Fortunately, the errors are easier to spot and less lethal.Yes. The prose style is rambling, chatty and almost unreadable. Did he derive his style from instant messenger postings?I contribute nothing by hammering the poor man when he is down, even if deservedly so.I just wanted to second the motion, which is a few screens back if you use the default ""newest first"" sort, by Andrea Loughry that anyone interested in this topic would be well served to read The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis. That suggested itself to me while reading (I mean ""slogging through"") Norman's little book and what to my wondering eyes should appear but Ms. Loughry's review making the same point. Among other treasured ideas I derived from Ms. Willis' book was that the Plague contributed to The Reformation. Please go buy it now."
2,Weak,"This is not a very good book.Rather than being about the `wake of the plague', most of the book rambles all over the place and in particular addresses the period before the plague struck Europe. Only the last, smallest, chapter specifically deals with events after the 1348-50 plague.The author makes frequent personal judgements on events and persons of the period and injects his own views, some of which are unpleasant, into the narrative.One would do better to read McNeill, Horrox, Cohn, Kelly, or Oldstone."
2,Not really about the Plague,"This book portends to be a history of 'the black death,' but reads more like a general history of mid 14th century England. It does offer some interesting arguments about the causes of the plague, but glosses over primary sources for those arguments. Overall I found myself racing to get through the book and move on to my next title."
2,Some interesting info,"There is interesting info in this book. Some well-told stories. But it seems like the first or second of what should have been four or five drafts. The ending is bizarre. He does not seem to have had an editor. He says things more than once, sometimes on the same page. Not a well-constructed book. Curiously, he says this about other authors in his useful bibliography. I have no desire to read another book by this author. If I was using this book for research, it would not be very easy to find info in this book, although it does have an index."
1,A very unprofessional piece of work!,"I was excited to start in on this book, as it was a gift from my son and I love history. About a chapter into to it I realized the author was definitely not subjective in his writing. There are strong anti-royalty, anti-wealthy, anti-organized religion (ie.very anti-Catholic) rantings and sarcastic remarks, which I found extremely unacademic, and the content was repetitous and jumbled. Because of this unprofessionalism I seriously began to doubt the author's information and theories which otherwise would have been extremely thought provoking. A ""D"" grade at best!"
1,"""Ring Around the Rosie"" Is Not History","I've been surprised by the good reviews this book has received. I picked it up on impulse, but once I began reading, I was almost immediately disappointed. On page 5, the reader is treated to the old chestnut about ""Ring Around the Rosie"" being some sort of race-memory of the Black Death. The silliness reaches a peak when Cantor brings on Fred Hoyle's fruitcake hypothesis that pandemics are caused by viruses from outer space. And in between-- If Margaret Thatcher were not a public figure, that ""joke"" of Cantor's about her would probably be actionable.One last thing: If you're going to read this more than once, keep a pencil by your side on the first read-through. Cantor doesn't seem to know what commas are for, but there's no reason for you to suffer through his undifferentiated writing more than once."
5,Share a mother's naming insights,"You may not find the traditional, overused Biblical names here, but you will find the latest, up-and-coming ones - especially some you've never heard or thought of before. Each name is followed by meanings and insights, including stereotypes of the name. The book isn't comprehensive, but for those of us who'd rather not wallow through pages and pages and pages of names, these are the best Biblical choices out there...and everyone of them researched. Not only a good name book, but a fun read! What other name book can you say that about???"
1,Misleading,This book leads you to believe that it has all the bible names available or at least a good portion of them. But it was missing some on the most basic names such as Joseph. My Husband and I were very disappointed with this book after waiting for it for several days to arrive by mail.
5,Another good one,"I did not look at many name books, but this one is a definite one to look at! Very insightful and well written!"
2,Version 2.0 is bad - a real Rip-off,"I totally agree with Drummin' Joe and his review. Stimulant X version 2.0 is really watered down. I orange pill of version 2 gives me a little bit of energy, but nothing very noticeable.Compared to the red/white pill (version 1) - this is snake oil. Version 1 was really something - really incredible. One pill of version 1 would keep me energized well throughout the entire day and into the night. Version 1 feels amazing. I really wish they would bring it back. If anybody knows of something out that that is still being sold that is similar to Stimulant X version 1, let me know. This stuff is too ""mainstream"" for the average soccer mom."
4,Good Stuff!!,"This stuff is amazing, it makes you feel good with no type of downage. You have to force yourself to eat."
4,Excellent legal mystery,"What I liked is the meticulous attention to detail characteristic of Barbara Holloway's investigation. Some may say the book is too long with too little action, but it illustrates how an attorney must function. Pursuing each detail, many of which lead nowhere. The story isn't perfect. While some discrepancies of evidence are discussed in great detail, there were quite a few revealed in the finale that had not been previously mentioned. But an obvious puzzle is not even mentioned let alone resolved until the end, even though it is a dead giveaway. And the conclusion is a little too neat.I don't agree with comments that the book carries an anti-Christian bias or a political message."
5,leaves you wanting more!,"Barbara Holloway takes on yet another difficult, unusual case. But this time her father is on the same case. Different suspect. Can they sort out their relationship enough to remain father and daughter? Or will the lawyer in them both make life unbearable as each tries to make their case for their client?Fantastic character development and descriptions."
5,Two master melodists,"Bill Evans had fur tipped fingers. Somehow, his playing was always softer and more mellow and melodic than any other jazz pianists of his time. Add to that the master of melody that Toots was, and you have a beautiful CD. It's not all soft and sweet, though. Both musicians could swing, too, and they swing a bit on this CD, too. A really nice jazz CD, with some really fine jazz musicians."
2,a tough read,"at times the book seems as if it was taken directly from a german to english translator program and published. there are sections that are nearly impossible to read without a couple of passes. i had hoped to use this as a text for abap training, but it is somewhat confusing to follow, and offers very little detail beyond what can be taken from abap on-line help. there are bright points, such as some of the dialog programming discussion, but overall, i think there are better development books available."
3,Not great for petite people,"For the most part, this is a great backpack. It looks nice, and seems to be very well made. However, the straps of the backpack are set too widely apart for my frame (I'm 5'1"", 115 lbs) so the edges of the straps scrape against the skin of my inner arms when I walk, which is very uncomfortable. I had to return the bag."
5,Baby Bjorn backpack,Not like to previous BabyBjorn bag I purchased (3 years ago) this is a great bag.1. It has a firm construction which makes it very convenient2. The compartments are very functionalMy only problem is that the bottle compartments are small and do not hold a 1 liter water bottle. I would rather like to have a small bottle holder for feeding and another external holder for larger bottles just like in outdoor backpacks
3,Thought it would be roomier,I got this as a gift from my mother in law because I was expecting my 2nd and knew a back pack diaper bag would be more user friendly with 2. The compartments are not very big. The front one is good for food and stuff for my toddler but the back one seems packed with just the diapers and bare necessities. I would prefer deeper and wider pockets and might just look for a regular back pack on sale at back to school time.
2,not enough pockets!,"This backpack has a lot of great things - lots of space, etc - but there is no small pocket on the outside for keys, etc and its really annoying! Also, the side insulated pockets for bottles are really small and don't fit sippy cups for older kids very well. I probably wouldn't buy this again."
2,Don't get sucked in,"After using this bag I truly believe that the people that designed it have never actually cared for a baby! The entire bag is too small. The main section does not open enough to allow easy access to things inside. There are not enough pockets. The pockets that it does have don't make sense for a diaper bag/pack. Where, exactly, do they expect the diapers to go? The side insulated pockets are neat for bottles, but not neat enough to warrent purchasing this item. For the amount of money I paid for this I could have gone to REI and gotten a fantastic backpack that had everything I needed. As a matter of fact, I am going to return this and go to REI. I was sucked in by the name and the fact that it ""matched"" the Baby Bjorn sling. Don't make the same mistake."
5,Great Backpack for Baby/Kid,I have purchased 2 of these baby backpacks for grandchildren. This product is wonderful and can be used for years as children grow. It is very durable and sporty looking which makes dads really like this product.
1,I thought..,"we where going to cast our ""archetypal wheels"" with the workshop participants, but not the case. The first three CD's are informative, but mostly filled with Caroline's stories, many of which I had already heard. In the last CD Caroline talks about the first two positions on the wheel, then asks the audience something to the effect, do I have to go any further with you people, and then stops. She is assuming that everyone has the book Sacred Contracts, which I do. The reason I got the CD was because I found that casting the wheel on my own was confusing. So I thought that casting it with the workshop and hearing Caroline helping the participants with their wheels would shed some light on mine.Very disappointing."
3,A little disappointing,"I have listened to most of the Myss CDs and read all of her books. I found her attitude on this set of CDs at times off-putting. Myss is always opinionated and self-assured; in this CD she at times borders on bigotry about the practices/beliefs of others (and I say this even as I can sympathize with her lack of patience) and she definitely crosses over to obnoxiously cocky. I like my seekers to be still seeking, not know-it-alls.Still, I give this set three stars because the new insights I got were worth it, in the end."
1,Attitude and language created a barrier,This was my first experience with Caroline's work and I was very disapointed in the way she talked about and to other people. I tried to get past the first CD but finally I just decided that I wasn't going to listen to it. I expect someone who wants to be a spiritual leader to at least be kind enough not to verbally attack their audience.
5,High Voltage stuff!,"I always knew that arquetypes are a tool for understanding my enviroment.Caroline Myss organizes my bits and pieces and shows me how to work with this magnificent tool in order to find my sacred contract.I recomend strongly this material to the ""responsible"",""self esteemed"",to ""the seeker"" that wants to FIND and works on himself with the wise guidence of this blessed soul and teacher,Caroline Myss."
1,disappointed,This is NOT THE BOOK ON CD. I was so very disappointed that the CD set I ordered is not the book Sacred Contracts. I don't think Myss likes audio books. I found the same situation with Anatomy of the Spirit. The CD is more of a lecture in front of an audience. I expected the Book and got something totally different. Buyer Beware.
3,Finding Your Sacred Contract,"I think Caroline Myss is a fantastic person and writer. But trying to find my ""sacred contract"" has been a bust. She tells us in this book that we all came on earth to accomplish a ""sacred contract."" And that may be true for her but I have yet to find mine and now that I am 84 years old, it is too late."
1,Nervous,"This Jojoba oil came in a different package than what is shown. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but the oil has a terrible smell to it. I have used Jojoba oil before, Dessert Essence to be exact, and it has never smelled like this!?! I really am concerned that it may not be Jojoba oil or not all of it anyway, and having extremely sensitive skin i guess i'll just be throwing it away. I would certainly reccommend this oil but i would not buy from this vendor again!"
5,Great Results.,"I have been fighting breakouts for decades. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo, thick skin. I would never dream of putting oil on my face regularly. I am very happy with the results. 2 drops after cleansing has been the best for my face. It doesn't clog my pores at all. It is supposed to be the closest oil match to our natural skin oil. It seems to clears out the existing acne. The oil works on my hair to get rid of fly aways and frizz. I use it on my daughter's hair and skin (and she has sensitive normal to dry skin). I use for baby massages also. It so is lightweight."
5,came quickly and did not leak,"I am using this oil as part of my nightly cleansing routine. I actually use this in conjuction with castor oil as my cleanser. It is very lightweight. It does not smell bad. It absorbs into the skin and moisturizes, but I do not break out. Very pleased with the packaging, too, as it did not leak in transit. The only improvement would be if it came with a dropper."
5,A good substitute for moisturizer and good with use with Acne medication,This product is very good on the skin and helps lotion or any other cream pierce into the skin. It good for hair or on the skin. I just use my on the face to help the cream I used sink in to get all the minerals from it. Very good product and will last a while.
3,Garden Application,My application is preventing bugs from eating up my garden. I've just started applying it and don't know how effective it is yet.
2,Is It Actually Organic?,I haven't used this product yet but the real product labeling says 100% pure. It does not say organic or USDA organic. Someone has slapped a inventory & bar code label on the product that says it is organic but the actual product labeling does not say organic. Beware: you may not be getting an organic product.
2,Jojoba oil,never really noticed much of a difference using it at all. I did not feel that it really helped at all.
2,Not organic anymore.,"I have been ordering this product for the past couple of years, and this last shipment noticed that the smell has become very oily. It is obviously not organic anymore. I order non-organic jojoba oil as well, and it smells exactly like it. I have filed a formal complaint with Amazon to investigate this matter. DO NOT buy this product if you think you'll be getting organic jojoba oil."
5,So many uses!,"This product is fantastic! I use it for shaving, washing my face, hair, bath oil, and a moisturizing lotion.Shaving: I usePhilips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black. It can go wet/dry. I simply wet my face, apply jojoba oil to my face, massage it in, and begin shaving. Never had a closer shave in my life.Face wash: My acne issues have pretty much faded completely using this product. Oil dissolves oil, so it actually cleans the face very well. It doesn't clog pores and, since it mimics the skin's own natural oil, helps prevent future clogged pores.Hair: My hair can look a little dull, so a drop or two of jojoba oil adds just a little natural shine, manageability, and softness.Bath Oil: Extremely moisturizing.Moisturizing Lotion: I wear cologne daily. Since I have dry skin, it would never stick. Rubbing jojoba oil on beforehand makes my cologne last at least twice as long!"
2,it might work...,I wish I could have smelled this before I bought it. It smelled a little nutty or coffee. It might have worked well but I couldn't get past the smell
1,"This brand is not expeller pressed, i.e. not cold pressed)","I love, love, LOVE jojoba oil and was excited to see the low price of the Desert Essence brand. But it's not expeller pressed, i.e. not cold pressed, so chemicals are used to extract the oil. I returned this one and bought the NOW brand."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to try this oil because of all the rave reviews. However, the disappointment began from the moment I opened the packaging- the bottle was damaged and wasn't sealed properly. I tried smoothing some oil into my hands, and noticed a repugnant smell- I had no idea it had an odor. For something that is supposed to be organic and plant based, I expected something a little more natural-smelling; this oil smells.. like cooking grease or something.I'm rather disappointed. Guess the search for the perfect essential oil continues!"
5,It works!,"I have suffered for decades from what I thought was dandruff. Dandruff shampoos of all kinds did not do anything. Then one day, when, browsing through the shampoo, et cetera, section of a grocery store, looking for something else, I came upon a 2 oz bottle of this stuff. I can't remember why I examined the label, but I had become convinced that my problem was my scalp was too dry (so the shampoos were probably making things worse), and this stuff supposedly would moisturize it.Well, it worked! If you have the same problem, by all means try this stuff."
3,It was ok.,This product was ok. It sort of smelled like burnt cooking oil which was troublesome. I'm not sure if it's supposed to smell like that. Other than that the product was fine.
4,Works,"Boyfriend used Head & Shoulders and some other Seisun Blue all in an effort to get rid of dandruff but to no avail until this product, which I found rave reviews in MakeUpAlley and it works but must be used daily."
4,Great,"I like how the oil does not sting my eyes and that it has many uses.I have combination skin, so I use it as moisturizer and eye cream.This is what do, rub the oil into your hand before putting it on your face.It also doubles as cuticle oil."
1,Fraud,"This is Not Organic and was suppose to be removed by Amazon as false advertising. This oil is awesome but lets face it, if you really want organic you have to pay for it...if it's too good to be true it probably isn't, and in this case it is not."
4,"really, some great stuff - perfect for dandruff and more","I now live by this stuff. I use it to fix my severe dandruff. Just a couple drops after showering and it's all good. Seriously, dandruff shampoo didn't help much, but this fixed it!The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because it leaves a shine on basically whatever you use it for. I'm not fusing about it as it is just the nature of oil, and I really don't think they could improve as far as that."
5,A Beauty Must,"I you love bathing in oil like I do, you'll love this one. This one leaves you with a very luxurious, silky feel. I massage it onto my scalp, my hair... unlike Castor Oil, coconut oil, olive oil or almond oil or any other one I've used, this one's lighter. You can easily remove it with shampoo.I massage it all throughout my face (never clogged pores), my body (unlike coconut oil, I hope this one doesn't grow hair. Yes, if you like your hair on your scalp or anywhere else to thicken or to grow, use coconut oil)This acts as a wonderful conditioner for the hair. It's natural, it's organic, it's inexpensive, I love this oil."
3,Hate the smell!! :(,"Description says that it has no smell, but to me it has a pretty distinctive oil smell. Similar to sunflower oil, not as intense though. I love using oil after the shower and my skin does feels nice, but at the end of the day all my clothes smell like i have been cooking fish all day :("
5,Love It!,"This product is really amazing.. It works as an amazing moisturizer I applied it to my face and it looks oily at first but in 5 minutes this oil absorbs in your skin.. leaving your skin moisturized and soft. To me, this oil smelled like grinded coffee beans.. but that was my first observation.. I'll have to smell it again to be sure."
4,Happy to receive it afterall!,"I ordered this item about 3 weeks back. When it didn't arrive on the date expected, I started e-mailing the seller. The seller explained what happened. But it was actually the call I made, that the seller took immediate action and send me the item overnight, with an extra 4oz bottle in the package. I was delighted to see that! I have no complains with them any more, they know how to help their customers. Can't wait to try it on, and to see the wonders of this product! This particular brand is also featured on many beauty sites that I came across when searching for the uses of this oil."
5,Incredible Product,This is one of those life-saving type products you cannot live without. I use it as a facial moisturizer. I also use it on my hands which are sometimes dry from chemicals at work. The only problem is you really cant use this product on your face in the day because you'll look to shiny. But apply it every night for sure. It keeps the skin moisturized and it also really cures acne and blemishes.Don't be alarmed by the seemingly high price. All you need is a few drops per application. The stuff lasts forever.
1,THEY WILL SELL YOUR NAME/ADDRESS,"This magazine will sell your name and address to every magazine under the sun, so you will receive a lot of offers in the mail.I subscribed under a nickname that I only used for this magazine, so I know when my name is being sold."
1,automatic renewal:,"THis is a BAD idea for comsumer but GREAT for magazine company.If I like this magazine I will renew on my own. At one timemagazine companys did this for comsumer, myself included, butI did not realize this was a policy of the magazine company;therefore, I wondered why I was being billed for annual magazines.After researching the situation, I realized what the NEW GAME was.Again, automatic renewal a bad idea."
3,Bleak look magazine with OK food,"At first glance this magazine looks very boring - no color pictures, dull newsprint-like paper. I have always found it challenging to make a recipe that doesn't show what your end product should look like. In that respect, this magazine isn't very helpful. What it is good for is learning some new cooking techniques. It explains processes in understandable terms.I recommend purchasing one issue of this magazine first from a bookstore before deciding on a subscription."
5,Fabulous Magazine,"I just love this magazine. I read it cover to cover and find myself going back to it constantly. They explain everything wonderfully - I have never read a better cooking mag. I also just got my mother in law, who is an amazing cook, a subscription for mother's day. Absolutely recommend it."
3,Needs to be in color,The recipes and information is great in Cook's Illustrated. The only really bad thing is that it's not in color. When they're comparing the a burnt bread to a well cooked bread it would be easier to see it if the photo was in color.
2,eh. not that great.,"sorry, but I don't feel like their experiments are very well done. They just don't seem to have thought things through, or researched at all, before trying stuff out. Issues are short and fail to innovate."
2,Complicated Gourmet Food!,"If you have all the time in the world to cook, then this black and white magazine is for you. The recipes are definately NOT something you can do in an hour or less. Plus, many of the ingredients the recipes call for are hard to find. I've been receiving the magazine for 6 months now and haven't made anything from it yet. Don't waste your time unless you are a gourmet chef."
5,The Best,"My cooking has improved tenfold since I started receiving this magazine (and watching the show, America's Test Kitchen, on PBS). I can't seem to stop making their recipes.I can't recommend it enough!"
1,be very careful.....,"This is a great magazine - buy it anywhere but from the source. If you do go ahead and get a subscription, be prepared to receive books and 'specials' you haven't ordered as 'previews'. Of course they offer a preview period, which is usually over by the time you actually get whatever it is they sent you. Also be wary of ordering books or DVD's from them. I ordered a DVD and kept getting unsolicited books from CI for a year. The material is pretty good, although not particularly healthy - usually high in fat and calories. It's the company and it's sales approach that is aggravating."
1,"Great magazine, terrible delivery on first issue","I gave a subscription as a gift to a friend back in April. I was told that the first delivery would be sometime between July 11 and August 8 which I thought was unreasonable, but I let it go. It is now August 12 and I am being told that delivery would be 'by September 8' -- for the July/August issue! From now on I will be going directly to the publisher."
5,"If cooking is a hobby, then this is a must!","I am a culinary student at Johnson & Wales University. I absolutely love this magazine. I also subscribe to Bon Apetite and Gourmet but this particular magazine stands above them all. It is filled with lots of information. They test different products to let you know which is your best buy. As a future chef, I will always be reading this magazine just to further my knowledge on cooking techniques, methods, and just ""did you know?"" information. These recipes will surely show you the best way to cook and give you all the reasons as to why things are done in a certain matter. This makes a great gift for the cook at home!! Enjoy!"
5,Brava Baltsa,"Recorded in 1981, this is Baltsa at her heart stopping best and is an absolute must-have for anyone who loves great music. Von Karajan famously called her the most important mezzo of our time, I think no one ever argued the point."
4,Great Father Son Project,"Though my son was about to turn 6 this XMAS I suspected this toy would be a good one for teaching him how to follow instructions, how to visualize the pieces coming together as a whole, and for building dexterity. Warning: I do have some facility for building things, and the patience of Job, but I think anyone would find such a project a positive bonding experience. We spent a couple of hours on two different occasions putting it together, and he and his buddies have spent many hours enjoying it."
2,Will not stay together,I bought this for my 8 year old son. We spend about 2 hours putting it together. Easy to assemble but near impossible to stay together for play. we returned the toy as it frustrated my boys.
3,Buy some Superglue!!,"Some of the reviewers stated that the blocks do not stay or snap together well. We experienced the same problem. It is very frustrating for my son to spend time following the directions and making some some progress, only to have everything fall apart underneath. We finally just resorted to using superglue to glue the blocks together. Definately not LEGO quality in that department. We also have the Vorgan Ice Fang that we had to glue together also. They both have very good detail and they do like playing with them though."
4,Dragon Mountain,My 9 year old son loves Dragon Mountain. He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys. It took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together.
5,More great music!,"I bought this CD cuz I loved the songs from the DDR soundtracks. All of the songs are just as good/catchy/dancey as the ones I bought it for! If you've heard Bambee's music and you like it and you're thinking about getting this but not sure, buy it! You won't be sorry!"
3,Don't try to listen to this one in the car!,"Great content, but they should have someone else other than the author read it. He speaks painfully slow, and quietly. I mainly buy audio books so I can listen to them while driving. However this book isn't going to work for that. It has to be so loud in the car to hear it over the car it's not worth it. You'll have to listen to this one in the house!"
5,Soulful and Powerful talk,"Ramana Maharshi one of the greatest spiritual teachers of last century, when asked about the number of spirtual teachers teaching various paths, Whom should one take for one's Guru (teacher)? He said to choose the one where you find you get shanti (Peace). Well Eckhart Tolle is the one that brings me the greatest Peace. Eckhart comes across as a gentle humble man with great insight and an extraordinary skill in bringing profound wisdom in an easy to digest format.This is a great talk with much warmth, humour, wisdom and insight.If you have enjoyed Eckhart's previous work, I'd highly recommend this one :)"
4,Bear Review,The Plush is nice. My son enjoied it very much.The only problem was that in the first days itloose some hair.
5,Superb pictures,"This is another winner! One of most beautiful book on frogs I've found, and these books are hard to find. The pictures are awesome. Excellent work Mr. Badger! For more information on frogs check out ""Frogs a chorus of colors"" by Behler. Less pics but more info."
5,Absolutely Spectacular Photography!!!,"A terrific book about the 2600 mile Pacific Crest Trail. The text is well written and easily read. As one who has contemplated the journey, I was thrilled with the detailed descriptions of the authors' trek. But for me, it is the pictures that make this a winning book. Over 100 stunning shots of everything from lakes, flowers, and trees to mountains, wildlife, and even one unbelievable photo of lightning! I can daydream for an hour over each picture. Composition and lighting are superb. I can't imagine anyone not saying ""Wow!"" again and again as they page through this book. An excellent book...absolutely spectacular photography!"
5,West Texas Soul Food,"Both More Calf Fries to Cavier and it predecessor Calf Fries to Cavier could have just as aptly been titled ""West Texas Soul Food I and II"". The books contain an abundance of recipes for hearty, comfort-food dishes which many West Texans, as well as Southerners and those from the Southwestern United States, grew up eating. Both Calf Fries and More Calf Fries to Cavier should be essential in recipe collections of folks wanting to discover a special niche in home cooking. My wife, who is originally a New Yorker, swears by these books and has used them as her basis to a discovery of Texas home cooking."
3,HP workhorse,This was a workhorse of a printer. I had a few compatibilty issues with windows 7 64bit. Nonetheless that was a 64 bit issue.
2,Good mag,"I had a trial subscription to Truckin and really liked all of the articles and how-to pieces in the magazine. But if you get around to cancelling, beware: their subscriptions department conveniently seems to ""forget"" if you try cancelling and are quick to call in a collection agency. Other than that, I enjoyed the publication very much."
2,Too bad,"This cart is NOT worth the money. Too bad too because it is a good arrangement & size of drawers for scrapbook materials. Cannot find anything comparable in arrangement of drawers.Mine arrived with a broken drawer. Then the drawer inserts didn't fit together or fit into the drawers correctly...had to sand the ends down to make them fit properly.Then after using it for a month, the wheels started to break...very cheap wheels. Had to go to HD and improvise to put some new wheels on it.The only thing sturdy about the cart is the metal frame."
3,Hobby Cart,"The cart, which I am using for scrapbook accessories, arrived in excellent condition and was easily assembled in less than 1 1/2 hours. We had the cart loaded in no time and it fit perfectly in the closet as planned. We are pleased with this purchase."
2,Wait for the movie(s),"Lots of speculation and innuendo; very short on facts.This book offered nothing new on any of the cases featured. In fact, most of the information appeared to come from old newspaper clippings. If you're looking for ""who-dun-it-and -why,"" this is not the book for you.For anyone who knows absolutely nothing about ""old"" Hollywood and its stars, you might find it interesting."
3,Hollywood Book,"I requested More Hollywood Unsolved Mysteries and I was sent the wrong book. ( Hollywood Unsolved Mysteries ) The bookstore was kind enough to send me a full refund plus they told me to keep the wrong book, I guess because it would cost more in postage than what I had paid for the book. It was an honest mistake."
3,Good light,"This is (currently) the only BLUE LED flashlight that is out there - others are UV lights for CSI. I use it for doing backstage work during theatrical shows. The blue light is bright enough to clearly see everything, and not too bright to bounce all over the place.The housing is a nice metal, however, the overall quality is lacking. The internal battery compartment is cheap (but still works), the placement of the switch is stupid for this size of light (on the butt of the light would have been smarter), and the overall design could have been better. - Aside from quality, the product works as needed and I haven't had any issues yet."
1,If it weren't for the drips....,"I was very impressed with this iron for the first few shirts, but then it started to leave wet spots. The problem was persistent and serious enough that I ended up sending the iron back. I was very disappointed to find what may be just a quality control problem in such an expensive product. Others of course may be more lucky."
1,"Decent voice, horrible cover","Although Joss Stone does have an intriguing voice, her cover of ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" isn't worth buying or even listening to on TV. She took a great song and made it into a waste of time. If she's going to continue messing up songs, she should at least wait until she builds a somewhat decent fanbase so there will be people who don't want to smack her upside the head."
1,Not good at all,"this cd sucks this girl is just a wanna beshe had to cover a white stripes hit so she can get noticed and she changed the lyrics! come on that song was popular 2 years ago, that is a big mistake she made the song sound like crap blues or whatever this cd is crap. I bought it and returned it the same day not worth it at all she is a not talented hippy trying to make it big by covering soungs that were popular 2 years ago! im not a big hilary or avril lavigne fan but man @ least they didnt go this low to cover songs that were popular 2 years ago stay way from this cd and artist its crap"
4,Fell in love with Joss.,"I'm shocked at the reviews of this single. This song has really caught on to me. I think Joss has an unusual sounding voice that makes her special, new talent. Who cares if she remakes songs? A lot of artists do that, some of them being very reputable artists. I wish Joss the best, I think she has some real talent."
1,Craptacular Cover,"Her cover of the White Stripes ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" is unnecessary and awful, to be kind. Rather than listen to a cover of this ""classic,"" go buy the real thing and forget about Joss Stone."
1,Blatant rip off artist,"Until Joss Stone comes up with her own songs, she will forever be a hack. I would much rather listen to artists with original material than her crap."
3,Justice Hall,"There is much to like in ""Justice Hall""--evocative descriptions of English landscape and English architecture, domestic and grand; an education on the country house shooting party; the curious overlay of transportation, ancient and contemporary, which marked the post WWI years; the brutal circumstances of trench warfare. But, as with all the Mary Russell novels, a willingness to suspend disbelief is essential--especially if you are a dyed-in-the-wool Sherlock Holmes fan. The plot and characters will otherwise spoil what is in many ways an enjoyable romp (except when King is on the ""Shot at Dawn"" soapbox, or the overabundant symbolism of the Hall and its beautifully painted dome). Ms. King does her best to instruct readers new to the series on past relationships, but this leads to rather too much backstory. Nevertheless, there is a lot of atmospheric fun to be had keeping Holmes and Russell company."
1,Is it just me?,"I pose just 3 questions:1. Has the author ever read a Sherlock Holmes novel?2. Has the author ever spent any time in the UK?3. Has the author ever studied plot as a function of story telling?I don't get it, in spite of all the great reviews (with all due respect). I keep getting the sense that the empress wears no clothes.Frankly if I were Sherlock Holmes (or A. Conan Doyle, I would be offended."
4,A good story... if you've been following the series,"This is a detailed story, anchored with real-world political details which do fold into the plot, but if you havent been following the series, you probably wont get caught up in the characters. Ali and Mamoud, characters from Oh Jeruselem, are central... with such a surprising past that it almost seems hokey. Holmes is much more distant and peripheral, to my disappointment; I enjoyed the Mary/Holmes interplay in the first novel.In some ways, this is just another English Country House novel, but I find it saved by the references to real-world events. Also, King has made sure that all character's motives are consistent and believable- there's no random actions just to get the plot moving. (Except I do wish she didnt have Ali show up on the doorstep injured- I suspect this was done to get an exciting and extractable first chapture!)"
4,Good to the almost-last drop,"Laurie King is too good a writer to have given us such a perfunctory ending. This is--to my thinking--the best book of the series, with wonderfully developed characters and a carefully researched context that engages the reader from beginning to almost-end. It felt as if Ms. King was herself deeply involved in her own story until she suddenly gave it all up to a quick, formulaic tying together of loose ends. Zip. Done, and done quickly with little artistry."
3,what happened to Russell/Holmes?,"I love this series, but I missed some things in Justice Hall I had been hoping for: Holmes and Russell don't seem as connected as they were, and Holmes himself doesn't seem as sharp, as witty, as insufferable. The flame has been turned down. Darn."
3,"Good Mystery, Bad Interplay","Like others, I think this book ultimately is less than satisfying because there is not enough Holmes/Russell interplay. King made a conscious decision to marry these two, rather than simply make them partners ala Holmes and Watson. Since she did that, I at least think she ought to have them act like they are married. They seem to have far less affection between them than Sherlock and the Doc did. I always thought, when reading all of the canon, that Holmes really had a great deal of fire and passion beneath his veneer, as demonstrated by his feelings for Irene Adler. I think King owes it to her fascinating Russell character to start writing some of that into the series. I will say, however, that, otherwise, the mystery in this book was very good, as were the secondary characters."
3,A disappointment,"As a fan of the Mary Russell series I found this latest one a disappointment. Sherlock is aging and has lost his caustic edge; Mary's prickly outlook has been smoothed; their relationship seems more like brother and sister than a married couple; the story is simply ""The List of Adrian Messenger"" with Sherlock Holmes and WWI.It is saved by Laurie King's writing -- always compelling -- and by the story of the horror of the executions."
4,Well Worth the Read Even if Not the Best in the Series,"While there isn't much of a mystery here - and there are no plot twists - the writing is amazing. King's phrasing is beautifully done and a delight to read. More than once, she made me smile and even laugh at loud so perfect is her cadence.If you haven't read the rest of the series, don't start with this outing rather start with ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice,"" the first in this series. You'll be hooked and will soon find yourself searching for a copy of ""Justice Hall."""
4,Married Mary,"I enjoyed Ms. King's latest Mary Russell book, although I think Mary herself is becoming boring. Where is the independent thinker of the first two books? Where is the snappy dialogue between Mary and Holmes? Since Ms. King married them off, Mary's personality seems to have become subdued. What happened?"
5,Who are these people?,"I just read the reviews below from those that didn't like Justice Hall, and I wonder what book they read? This latest Mary Russell book was terrific, veddy British, multiple characters, nice bit of Holmes but not too much as Mary comes to the fore. The end was a little predictable, but still a page turner. Mary Russell is terrific, and this is one of the best books of the series."
3,for fans,I'm a fan of Laurie King - Beekeeper's Apprentice was really great. I enjoyed reading this book - read it straight through in one sitting - but I think that she is running out of room in this series.
3,Disappointing,"When this title was first released I wrote a review about how disappointed I was. I felt the Russell-Holmes relationship was trivialized to the point of almost brother/sister; the insertion of all the history was tedious; and the most disappointing was that it was a thinly veiled retelling of the classic, ""The List of Adrian Messenger.""I just reread it. I haven't changed my mind. This is the least promising and entertaining of all the Russell series."
3,Justice Hall,"I enjoyed this book. While not the best in the series, it provided a welcome leisurely read during my lunch hours. Some plot points were evident in advance, but the depictions of country life and post WWI England were still worth the read, and there were some genuinely moving passages to provide reward. Was it great? No. Was it very good? Yes. If you, like me, want to read through the series in order, it is worth the time and money to read this one. In my experience, Laurie King is not really capable of writing a bad book."
5,My favorite Russell,"I am a big fan of this series of books and the author. I think 'Justice Hall' is my favorite. I enjoy the imagery and can visualize the setting fairly easily. I like the characters; they evoke empathy. My guesses were wrong, so it wasn't predictable. I think one could pick this book and not have to know about the rest of the series; it could stand alone. If one is familliar with the series - this is a must!"
5,love it!,"the Mary Russell, Sherlock Holmes stories are great! would recommend starting at the beginning of the series the story and characters are phenomenal!"
5,Another hard-to-stop listening mystery!,"Justice Hall was the first Mary Russell novel I had listened to in awhile, and now I am hooked again. The writing is first class, the mystery intriguing, and the setting so British! I like the humor and outspokenness of Mary Russell, and her relationship with Holmes is quite believable. It is more fun when they are together more in the story, but this one still was enjoyable and great listening!"
5,Holmes and Russell on a Splendid Jaunt,"""Justice Hall"" is the sixth in Laurie R. King's wonderful series about the incomparable detective duo of Mary Russell and her partner Sherlock Holmes. I strongly recommend reading the whole series in order (the first is ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice""), and re-reading ""O Jerusalem"" (if it's been a while) before you read this one, since the plot lines of the two are closely intertwined.While Holmes' and Russell's exploits are always a delight, this installment has the snappiest mystery plot of any in the series since ""Beekeeper's Apprentice."" The revelations of history add a new dimension to the characters of our old friends Ali and Mahmoud (now revealed to be Alistair and Marsh). Also, Russell is in her element in this seemingly placid country manor that nonetheless teems with dangerous undercurrents of greed and jealousy."
5,Simply Glorius!,"Being about the only teenager in the world who is proud to be a Chopin fanatic, I look at this as being the greatest of my collection. Rubinstein takes on these moving pieces as no one else can. Some move you to tears, other to ballroom dance and yet others to an incredible sense of freedom.Every song is a masterpiece, the writing is spectacular and the performance breathaking. Perfect for the person on your birthday/holiday list with taste that's a little more mature than pop or adult contemporary."
3,Definitive Chopin? I think not,"Initially, I was suckered into buying this CD from a classical music guide that touted this CD as one of Rubinstein's greatest. Fortunately, His Ballade in G minor lives up to the hype. I love how Rubinstein is able to perfectly and naturally balance his phrasings and rubatos without resorting to cheap sentimentality. Unfortunately, its the scherzi that Rubinstein goes downhill. To me, this rendition sounds much too bland and labored. In addition, the third and fourth scherzo has lost much of the impetuosity from his earlier recordings. I know for certain that he was holding back, considering his 1964 chopin recital was much more volatile and exciting than this lethargic recording. If you really want definitive scherzi's, try Richters or Yundi Li's recordings. For the Ballades, try Moravec's or Zimerman's. And by the way, RCA's sonics don't sound that great compared to the Digital CD's of today. Get the improved (and cheaper) SACD version."
1,can i give half a star?,ok im a bit bitter i spent a lot of money on these rubinstein volumes before hearing them(and theyre all DEPRESSING) but this review is sort of a warning to all genuine people out there:forget about it!bad sound/bad playing.just not definitive chopin..not to mention the pricethis fellow is overrated.
5,Simply Amazing....,"This is a must get CD of the Scherzi and Ballades of Chopin. Except for the Scherzo no. 1, which I rate this as second only to Horowitz's recording , there is no comparison to Rubinstein's technically brilliant and musically profound interpretations."
5,Taste Great Less Filling,You would think it taste like mud but as long as your not expecting some decadent stuff it's pretty good. I recommend to anyone who's looking for a before and after gym shake or looking for a meal supplement.
1,Not What I Hoped For,"I bought these when I started Body for Life. Unfortunately I made a mistake and didn't buy a smaller pack to try out first. I don't like the shakes, they are chalky and don't taste very good. I am afraid to mix them with other things because they are supposed to be the perfect ""meal"" for my program and adding other elements changes the content (obviously). I also didn't like the ready packaged verison that I bought at Walgreens last weekend. Not worth it, not filling, not good tasting. Buy the Myoplex lite bars instead, they are MUCH better and much more delicious!"
5,Great Resource!,"Kimball provides a great resource for any wanting to explore Postmodern worship and Gen-X, but NOT wanting to stereotype according to age. Kimball provides helpful tools and models without limiting them to chronology or geography.John JacksonPASTORPRENEURwww.pastorpreneur.com"
4,four stars---good read,"This is an excellent read...if you know someone who doesn't understand POMO this is the book you need to point them too.There's another book (and author) that is yet to be discovered... the book is ""A Mobile Church For E.P.I.C. Times: Crossing Faith Community Borders"" by Fred Peatross. Leonard Sweet wrote the Foreword and Brian McLaren and Sally Morgenthaler wrote back cover blurbs. Pick the book up here at amazon.com."
2,Cultural Christianity,"Until I read this book I was very interested in the ""Emerging Church"" but after reading this book I realized that the ""Emerging Church"" is not a movement in Christianity but just a movement in American culture. Unfortunately the author doesn't realize this and makes a lot of assumptions and only shares his perspective.The author is Gen X with a skewed view of the Millenial generation. These two generations are very different with very different cultural identities and attitudes. Of course, Christianity is going to have a slightly different culture, but to be honest Christianity tends to react to culture instead of paving a new culture.The emerging movement is a non-movement, in that emergents do not agree to on one set of definitions or have a leader to represent them. So how do you write a book about a non-movement? You really can't."
5,Rick Warren and Brian McLaren?!,"i was rather stunned to see the names of rick warren and brian mclaren on the same book cover. however, after reading the book it made perfect sense. this book does not point fingers or bash modernity or postmodernity - but allows a healthy discussion from both perspectives of what direction the emerging church is moving. i love that this book FINALLY goes beyond all the chatter about culture and postmodern theory and gives some helpful examples (but not a model) of what we in church leadership should try to do. i own virtually every book out there on postmodernism and the church, and this by far has been the most practical in giving helpful direction of stimuating ideas for our local context. i will be giving a copy to my staff as well as key volunteers."
2,A Book for the Cool Kids.,"Offers some important foundations to outreach to the postmodern generation and gives a helpful insight into exploring models of ministry beyond traditional Sunday mornings. BUT the focus was largely on reaching those who are simply a tad counter-cultural. ""If you are an artist and have a tattoo, you're in."" But what about ministry for the real world hard-living young adults who take real effort to spend time with?I got tired of Kimball boasting about his open-minded interactions with young adults and upholding his own pious routines for us all to admire."
4,Very good book,This book is well written and very informative. I had read it before but decided to read it again and glad I did. Material is very relevant and usable for those in the ministry or interested in learning more about ministry
3,"Several Problems, but better the 2nd time through","I read this book for the first time 8 years ago. I came to it with great enthusiasm only to be disappointed in reading what appeared to be another book on church growth - but this time to ""emerging generations.""For a side project, I decided to read this book again, with very little to look forward to. Yet this time while reading, and maybe it's because I've been a pastor for the past 4 years, it didn't sound nearly as bad. I still disagree quite heavily with many of Kimball's conclusions, but he came across as more truthful this time around. Did the book change? No, I did.The major problem I have is that the assumption is the church that is reading this already has a good size group of people (100+). This is tough to swallow when the surveys that I have read say that less than 10% of the local churches in the US have more than 100 people.Overall I give it 2.5 stars, but it is definitely better that my original .5 stars."
5,Songbird,"This rock-infused country album elevated EH to a new plane. Even though she covers other songwriters' music as before, she sings on this album in a way as though she wrote every track. It's less an interpretation and more personal."
4,An Excellent example of Emmylou's talent,"Featuring wonderful ballads such as ""To Daddy"", ""Easy From Now On"", and ""My Songbird"", this album is an essential part to any Emmylou Harris collection. Also featured are upbeat numbers that set your foot to tapping such as ""Two More Bottles Of Wine"", ""I Ain't Living Long Like This"", and ""Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight"". A great collection by a wonderful artist!"
3,quarter moon in a 10cent town,"Other than the fact that it took 6 weeks to receive the cd, I have no complaints. They must of had to record it in the studio before they could ship it out."
1,Emmylou Harris fan!!!,"Warning: The two bonus tracks are live. The songs are great, but it seems deceptive to me when they are not listed as such. It is industry practice to list on the cover when songs are live. With Emmylous' re-issues so far ( I have two more of the re-issued CD's to open and listen to ) they have been unissued studio recordings."
5,Good book,"This book helped me get an A on my research paper, it was on time and in good condition. I had a great experience with the purchase of this book."
5,Smart - Simple design!,This is a great product. Good quality hardwood and every piece is cleanly sanded and precisely made. Went together in an afternoon using my micropin nailer and turned out very sturdy! Loved that by purchasing two sets I could create the perfect dimensions for my space. Keep in mind that this works best with standard sized wine bottles; wider bottles - like some champagnes and larger wine bottles won't fit.
3,Poor sizing,"Not bad for the price, however several of the drill holes were poorly aligned in some of the rods. Four were totally unusable because they fit together at awkward angles so the layer didn't come out anywhere close to flat. Another four were too misaligned for use on a bottom row (it wobbled a bit) but I was able to use them on the top. All in all that means only half of the provided rods (in the 12 bottle kit) were drilled perfectly level. Additionally they claim that the support rods are made to be a little bit bigger then the holes so they fit together without glue, however I found that was only true for about half of them. At least with the support rods they provided extra though so it wasn't too big of deal.What I have left though is sturdy, looks good and wasn't too expensive. I'd suggest buying a little more then you think you need unless you're fine with a little wobble in your rack."
3,wine rack,"It does its job, but I really just bought it because it was the cheapest one that I knew would fit. It looks better than not having a wine rack, but it was a pain to put together, and I wouldn't ever want to try reassembling it if I decided I should change it. Other than that, no problems since I bought it two years ago."
4,Perfect for my pantry,"I wanted to find a wine rack that I could build into my pantry closet. I like this one because I was able to build it into a straight line to fit above a shelf. It's nice to be able to make it whatever shape you want. We came across the problem others had where some of the pins were too loose, so I took off one star for that, but there were enough pins that fit and when we got it all together, it held together fine. It looks great."
3,Total PITA to assemble!,"I seem to have had the opposite problem of the previous reviewer who received pegs that fell out of the holes in his kit. The pegs in my kit seem to be much too large for the holes. Pounding away with a mallet with all of my strength, I still have problems getting the pegs to seat fully in the holes. The oak pieces are nice, though crudely ""finished"", but the assembly with the pegs is driving me nuts! Unless you have many hours of free time and big muscles, I would avoid this wine rack kit.J.K. Adams MWR-40-OK Hardwood 40-Bottle Wine Rack, Oak"
1,Have to be an engineer,"This seems to be a perfect wine rack. It is put together like games we played with in grammar school, however it was also built by engineers that are still in grammar school. There is no possible way to get this rack to be level or sit straight on a flat surface."
5,This is the best.....for me.,"This system is very flexible and very easy to assemble. If you buy two or three when they are on sale, you can assemble them the way you want, for the space you have, for the number of bottles you have. DON'T buy the cheap Chinese clones...... I love it!"
4,Nice Product,"After much research looking for a wine rack that was affordable and versatile, I settled on this product. I knew there would be some assemble, but I was surprised at how long it took me to put it together (think tinker toys). Having said that, once I got the hang of it it went a lot faster. The nice thing is that if you have an odd shaped space you will be using you can mold this to probably fit it. Also, don't worry too much about it not being level as you put it together, once you fill it with wine bottles it will level out."
4,Wine rack,This wine rack was very easy to put together. It seems fairly sturdy and I've not had a problem with it. It was also very reasonable in price. I'd buy it again.
5,Excellent product,"This wine rack is well designed and very well crafted. It came well packaged, in good condition, and with complete instructions for assembly. It looks and functions great!"
4,Good value - lot of work,I bought 9 cases of this product. Putting it together is not difficult but when you have 9 / 40 bottles racks it takes time! Also I bought them natural and stained them myself. That was time consuming as well. But a good value and the 360 bottles are sitting pretty
5,Versatle and sturdy,"My wife loves the way this is assembled, as we were able to shape it uniquely to fit our space. We bought two of these and are storing 27 bottles on them, with no problem."
5,"During dining, studying and before sleeping","I bought two sets of 12-bottle wine rack, and built them up to three small sets. One for dining room, second for my study-room, then the last for our bed-room. No other comments than wonderful. SamOkada"
4,Good product,"It is very strong and sturdy once assembled but the assembly was a little more difficult and certainly more time consuming than I was expecting. Once together however, I am very satisfied with it."
5,Great product that is simple to use,I have 4 of these kits that I have used to construct the racking system in my wine closet. They are fairly easy to assemble and all of the parts are made to specification so everything fits together well.
5,Just what it looks like,"I didn't need anything except a rubber mallet to put this together. I didn't glue it, since I wasn't sure of the configuration I would prefer. I gave it a ""step down"" effect, which turned out just right. It's sturdy and unobtrusive. I bet I add more to it later on."
5,"Nice Wine Rack, Assembly Required","It took me about 1 hour to complete the assembly with a rubber mallet. I built it in my garage since you need a hard enough floor for all the pounding. It's not too fancy, but is a beautiful wine rack. Another great product purchased from Amazon!"
4,Great expandable wine rack!,"I purchased two of these sets in order to get the capacity I wanted. It went together easily, had plenty of extra dowels to connect between the two sets and it looks great. I definitely think the hard wood is worth the extra couple of bucks over the softer wood versions given the amount of hammering it does take to put it together."
4,"Fun project, not super fancy but happy with it.","We just moved to France and wanted something for our basement, so my 6 yr old daughter designed the wine rack and we built a big triangle shaped wine rack. It was a good father daughter project and she shows it all of our house guests.I am very happy with it but it is not something I'd put in my kitchen or dining room. It is just naked wood and will eventually get dirty. It is very robust and sturdy."
2,wooden wine rack,"I got this to add to a wooden wine rack I already have by the same complany I ordered many years ago. I expected it to be the same, however, it has no clear varnish but is bare wood so it does not match and seems unfinished."
2,Tolerances are unacceptable,"Pros:- Great idea, modular is the way to go, as it can expand and fit any space.Cons:- Just visually looking at the hole positions on the flat sides, I could see positional variance. Tapping the pegs into the holes, there was obvious size variance. Not surprisingly, when I laid it out, it wobbled, as the bottom was not flat, and no amount of adjustment or swapped pieces would resolve it. Considering how simple this system is, that it's US manufactured, and the relatively high price, I expected it to fit together better.That said, I'm not sending it back, as I have a specific space to fill, and this fits. Once I load the bottles in, for the most part, it doesn't wobble."
5,Perfect for closet cellar,"I was looking for a sturdy support system for our wine. This kit allowed me to fit the rack exactly to the width of my closet. Easy to install, but time consuming. End result is very nice."
4,Good Fit,"I just finished putting together my second rack and found that the fit between the pegs and holes was much improved over the first one I assembled over a year ago. They provide plenty of extra pegs, so it wasn't a big problem anyway, but it was nice not to have to try multiple pegs before getting the right fit this time. I am keeping my sparkling wines in this rack and find that most of them fit well (and the ones with very large punts that don't fit in one of the squares can be put on top). They also feel much more secure in this style of rack than in other racks I have where I worry that the big difference between the wide bottom and narrow neck of the bottle will allow it to slip off. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it took well over an hour of pounding with a mallet to get it put together and it's more expensive than some racks I have which required much less assembly."
3,Would be great on a counter; fell off my wall,"This is a great solution for storing wine bottles on a counter or shelf. Storing wine horizontally rather than vertically ensures that denser elements don't sink to the bottom of the bottle.I fashioned a mount so that I could stick this rack to the wall, however. After about two years, the thing collapsed. Fortunately, none of my wine bottles broke."
2,No longer a good value,"This used to be a decent value when it was selling for $29, but at $43 it's tough to justify. I tried to place a couple 1.5L magnum bottles on the top row but with the additional weight, the wood connectors weren't strong enough to hold the lattice together. I had also hoped to continue expanding my set as my wine storage needs grew, but again, the price is now too steep."
2,Doesn't hold the bigger bottles!,"I have no quibbles with the quality of the construction, how it's assembled or the price, or anything except what size bottles it will hold.There are several sizes of wine bottles. The size that I need to store are the larger bottles - champagne, Martini & Rossi, etc. - not the very big bottles but the bottles that are about 1/2"" too big to fit. So I found it useless, and if you have of that size bottle - DON'T BUY THIS RACK! I wrote the company and told them if their dowels were all 1/2"" longer then this might work, and then I tried to take it apart so I could make longer dowels and found that you end up breaking the dowels off to get them out so if I do use longer dowels, I'm going to have to redrill the holes into which I had already put the dowels. Not worth the aggravation."
1,what a waste of money,"Impossible to put together. After trying for several hours to assemble just a few pieces, I gave up. If anybody out there wants to try their turn, it is free but for the shipping."
3,Disappointing,It is disappointing that the company does not offer any models that use longer dowels that would allow the storage of the 1.5 size bottles.
5,Good value,We have two of these now good for 24 bottles of wine. It is easy to assemble and inexpensive. The best feature is shaping it to fit your space at home.
4,"Works well, fun to put together.","Overall it works well, does what it's supposed to. Nice that you can buy several sets and expand or make custom shaped wine racks.Took about 30 minutes to put together, only required a hammer. If you're handy then it's fine but if you don't own a set of tools then buy something that you don't have to put together.My only complaint is that the wood could have been sanded a bit better. There were a bunch of small fragments sticking out."
5,Wonderful product,This versatile wine rack was like putting together Tinker Toys. It was very sturdy and did exactly the job I needed. I've had many compliments and am thrilled with the function and attractiveness.
1,Bummer,Ordered this for a friend of mine. He says it's thee worse quality recorded dvd he'd seen in a long time. I agreeed...
4,Splendid effort.,"Not as kitchy as their first offering, but still right on target. Both Bob Mayo and Allen Meece offer some of their best work here. Certainly worth a read."
5,Go Get It!!!!,"'Journey' is definitely on point! John Gray has brought a fresh new sound to music in 2004. You MUST get this in your collection. This CD will take you to another level in your relationships and in your life. MannaGod is doing Big Things! Buy the CD, you will not be disappointed!!"
5,Journey - Pre-Release CD by John Gray,"The CD has awesome music on it. It has substance, deep messages, tremendous styling and it leaves you with hope and a sense that God is in control. Most music does not do that. This does! Plus, John Gray has a fabulous voice. What else can there be?"
5,Dragon's Harvest By Upton Sinclair,"The entire series is now available for the first time in 60 plus years in hardbound, single book copy, except for the second book, Between Two Worlds. They are published in beautiful crimson color with added text from the first book World's End. Contact us at uptonsinclairinstitute.com for more informatiuon."
2,not what you expect,"Definitely did not meet my expectations. Barrettes don't clip easily, only can use a small amount of hair. the nails change colors but quickly change back, same with eyes and mouth. My little one (7) was disappointed. So was I...thank goodness I had gotten $5 off, but I still paid too much for what this product promised."
3,disappointed,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas morning. We opened it up and she enjoyed styling the hair and putting in the earrings and accessories. However when it came to changing the hair, nails, and make up different colors we had difficulty. The hair was already mostly pink so the cold water did nothing, the toe nails came already painted and the finger nails were half painted so again the cold water did nothing to them. All she can do is use warm water to make the color go away but it only lasts for a few seconds before it goes back to being painted pink. I am not sure if this was just a malfunction or if it's the way all of them are. Unfortunately in all the chaos of Christmas morning the box was thrown away so returning seems unlikely."
4,Fun! Use a hair dryer to get the color out!,My daughter loves playing with her Polly Pocket Stylin' Pose BUT she can't play with it without parental help. The only way to get all the color out of Polly's hair is to use a hair dryer on a high heat setting. The heat takes away all the color very quickly. Then the child needs icy water to put the color back on. My daughter will do this over and over again- she loves it.
4,Better than expected.,"When my daughter asked for this I was skeptical.But it does work and is lots of fun. I was concerned about the mess, but this is not a problem. It has also been a durable toy. We have had Polly for a year now."
2,stylin polly pocket,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old neice. The drawers where you store the stuff kept falling off. Also the accessorys were very small & difficulty to manipulate for a grown up. Wouldn't purchase again.
2,Beware!!!,"I love San Francisco, so I bought this DVD...Beware!!! It is a series of still photographs with narration! Why didn't they shoot a movie? $14.95 is pretty expensive for still photographs, no matter how pretty!"
5,"superb text, not for beginners","Before you purchase this or any other OCT, consider carefully whether you expect to need commentary or a teacher's assistance. For Vergil, if either of these is the case, Pharr's reasonably priced Aeneid 1-6 may be ideal--or at least more appropriate than the bare Latin text with notes on the manuscript tradition, which is all you will find in oxford's edition. Pharr's ample gloss and commentary make his Aeneid the best text for beginning/intermediate students of latin. For other Virgil texts, there are innumerable student editions of varying quality. Instead of wading through these, find a professor of the classics or a teacher of classical languages who will wouldn't mind offering his/her guidance."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!,"What is here stated to be the paperback of the Oxford Text of Vergil is, in fact, the work of a grammarian named Vergil. I will alert amazon.com to this mistake. Hopefully they will correct it. Until then, BE WARNED."
3,Galileo,"This telescope is good for beginners. It needs a larger eye piece for easier viewing. You REALLY need a dark night and little cloud cover to get optimum viewing with this. Once you find constellations, it's a great scope."
3,difficult to set up,"I dont think its very easy to set it up...however, once set up - its heavenly!!!definitely worth it"
3,"Bad gift for a child, fun for the parent","I purchased this as a gift for my 7 year old who is all about space. I figured I would need to get the telescope aligned with whatever we were looking for first, then let her use the eyepiece. Unfortunately, this telescope just requires too much time and attention to get the objects of interest in place, in focus, and then by the time I put her eye to the eyepiece, the earth's rotation has the object well on its way out of the field of view. So with my daughter, I ended up using the lowest magnification almost exclusively. There are easier telescopes for kids available at the lowest magnification.All that said, after she goes to bed, I've had a lot of fun with this telescope. The tripod is not as stable as I would have liked, so there is a lot of movement in the image, but otherwise its been fun!"
1,"no yoga benefits, low production quality",This DVD did not leave me feeling energized and refreshed. It is very fast paced; therefore not allowing for proper stretching. I have Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Vol. 1-3 tapes and they are great. But this video does not stand up to the others. The music and look of the video aren't very enjoyable either.
2,not bad,"I liked this program for the most part. My wife and I tried it and it was pretty good, but I gotta say, that once we were used to Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga, this was just average in comparison. I think Bryan has a decent style and invigorating practice...good for a sweat, but for the core workout and the mental space that I am used to going to, I did not find this to be the best ticket to the experience. He kept taking my attention away from the workout and that felt annoying. My wife did not have that experience, but she can even tune me out when she wants to...and she has been doing yoga much longer than I have."
5,Timetables for different processes of development,"This book contains timetables which purport to show the development of physical, biological historical processes. It contains explanations of the processes, maps and charts. It is filled with information and contains a glossary at the end which provides useful definitions of various terms.An excellent tool.But the book made me feel uneasy in one way. How does one measure within oneself the meaning of these various times and timescales? What do the numbers say to us? Are they simply meaningless ciphers, figures we learn? In other words there is some disassociation felt on my part here between the ' scientific information' presented and the human meaning it can be given. Perhaps that is not really relevant to what the book was meant to be. But this is one of the reasons I had that Whitman like feeling given in the poem "" When I heard the learned Astronomer"" the famous ' turned in silence and looked at the stars'."
5,Alias - the best show out there,"This is going to be an awesome collection when it comes out in September later this year. With all the twist and turns that the show offers, I dare you to watch it only once."
5,The Best Show...no longer on television,"Season 1 of Alias hooks you. The story of how Sidney gets entangled into living double-lives is immediately intriguing. The characters are talented and work extremely well together. This show has everything...kick-butt action, suspense, drama, and romance. This was hands-down the best show on television, and since it's no longer on tv, the only way to see it is purchase the dvds. You won't get bored from watching it over & over again."
4,Very Entertaining!,"I bought the first season and so far have found it very entertaining. Some things I find a bit ridiculous like going to recover a nuclear bomb, only having to deal with two guards, and then having sufficient time in a wide open warehouse to take the core out. Anyway, it's still fun to watch."
4,Alias Again,"This is a very well done series. I'm enjoying watching it again. I would recommend it to others. I guess considered the first ""Borne"""
3,Not a bad series for its time,"I'm sure this show would have been much better to watch in its day. But its still a pretty good show. Jenny Garner looks super hot, and before this show I didn't think she was that cute, probably cause she's with the douche Ben Assflex!"
3,Formulaic; predictable; and somewhat corny.,"Get an assignment; go here (and here always looks the same); do something sneaky; get caught-kind of; have a fight; and get back home in time for dinner with your friends without a scratch. Not sure if I can hang through the whole season... Nonetheless, I seem to be sucked into the series. Arugh!"
2,Alias the series,"This is a great series, somewhat difficult to pick up the pace at times, but in the end it works. I decided to watch it a second time. I think it makes the viewing much better. Having an understanding of where it is going makes it much more enjoyable. Great acting, not all episodes stellar, but how many series are? If you like it, watch it a second time. All the pieces come together."
2,Made it 6 episodes and removed from watchlist,"6 episodes seems like a fair trial. I can like over the top cliff hanging tv series with a little extra cheese on top, but I actually found myself gritting my teeth or fast forwarding through dragging reflective pop emo song montages that occur more than once in each episode. I learned after 3 or so episodes that the formulaic script writing is akin to law and order's 4th spin off. (normal grad student life scenes>extreme double secret agent missions>near capture> too love or not to love my dad; repeat. There are too many gaping holes in the story for me to overlook and I have no problem suspending disbelief when artistically led that way. Sure each show ends with ""oh no! what's going to happen?"", alas JG's character never gelled for me. I quit."
4,Must Watch!,"If you're not watching this show, start watching it immediately. JJ Abrahms is utterly brilliant in his ability to bring a show together. There is much intrique, drama, romance, and action. Why more people are not watching this show is beyond me."
5,I love this show,Being able to watch it via Amazon prime is excellent. Think a female James Bond and you're there. Highly recommended.
5,Alias,This was a very good show. I Missed the first season so this was a nice way to watch it and catch up on it.
2,huh?,"She always gets caught and then gets away. She travels the world but still has time for graduate school. She gets in fights and gets tortured but arrives home without a scratch,bruise or even jet lag. Nice action even if predictable but the only real mystery is how this show continued for five seasons."
5,ALIAS SEASON 1,Thank you for sending the DVD package so quickly. It's in good condition and we are getting caught up on what we missed. Great job!
5,Worth the price but WHERE ARE THE SPECIAL FEATURES?,"This is a great boxset. I became a fan of Alias mid-way through the first season and never saw the first 2 episodes until I got the dvds. I really appreciate seeing them in chronological order. The brilliant casting is so apparent and the character development is wonderful to watch, particularly the relationship between Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber.BUT--I have two complaints. Some of the scenes that take place at night or in shadowy basements (and that's a lot of them) seem very dark. I don't remember the shows looking this way when I originally watched them on television.Number 2--the Amazon review mentions many special features including Marshall's gadget gallery and auditions. I don't find those two at all. Are they hidden Easter eggs? Will someone please help me?"
4,Pretty good,this is a pretty good series even tho its a ripp off of la femme nikita series but what series isint lol
2,In short,"A painful cross between a videogame and a soap opera, supervised by an anime robot. Watch it to find out why you don't watch TV."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I tried watching this show but lost interest in it pretty fast. It reminds me a bit of Dark Angel and The X-Files, but the elements it has in common with those shows are handled in a much drier, less engaging way. And am I the only one who thinks Jennifer Garner was terribly miscast? She CANNOT play ""tough chick"". She's much more suited to comedy."
1,What's with the lame formatting?,"It is a cool show, and the emotional tension between Sidney and Vaugh along with Sidney's countermissions made season 1 the best so far. It does have a pretty cool style of its own (obviously borrowing from La Femme Nikita--film and TV, Run Lola Run--ok maybe just the red hair used in the first [Alias] episode, Buffy, etc.) which would grant it 3 to 4 stars, but, having watched it in HD most of the time, I must say to not even doing a widescreen transfer is rather pathetic (even Smallville will have that, and 24, which is not broadcast in HD gives the full widescreen picture too), you've got to hope they at least include the Dolby Digital soundtrack. A rental, but, certianly not to buy."
1,Oh no..after all this wait!,Online announcements of this long-awaited and eagerly anticipated set seem to be in agreement that we are going to get a full screen only transfer.I believe the series was filmed in HD and here in the UK terrestrial showings have been in widescreen which adds so much to the SKY satellite showings. It's a great improvement to see them W/S and there's no excuse for a lazy 4:3 transfer.I will NOT be purchasing this set if it does indeed appear fullscreen. I'll wait and see if there's enough fan anger so that they change their plans and produce it W/S or if the R2 (UK) release is W/S.What a disappointment after all this wait :)
1,no hi-def transfer...boo!,"I read that this won't be formatted for widescreen, and will be put into a full frame mode, despite being broadcast in widescreen on ABC. Disney, time to join the 21st Century! Until then count me out on purchasing what should have been the best TV series to hit DVD ever! Very disappointed :-("
4,Good show,Never watched it on TV. Decided to view it now. Good acting. Different types of scripts. Have enjoyed it greatly.
4,Change of Heart,"Ok, so I previously gave Alias Season One a two-star rating. The plots were horrible.However, I wrote the review before watching the 6th episode. Starting with this episode, the show improves dramatically. Perhaps they got a new writer?.......Now my husband and I, who almost gave up on the series, watch 2 to 3 episodes every night. Each episode is well plotted, and the ending just leaves you hanging....I have not given the show the full 5 stars because some plot details should be perfected. For example, what company keeps the same security code for 8 years? or how can you only dig 4 feet and find an underground cave which was built 500 years before?But it is good entertainment, and the characters are well drawn.Conclusion: 5 bad episodes in a series lasting now 3 years, can be overlooked. I'm glad I stuck it out.A new Alias fan."
5,One of the most consistent seasons I've seen,I started watching the show regularly during the 3rd season. By then the show was more inconsistent but it still was good enough for me to go back and watch past seasons. The 1st season is the best by far. There is a sense of fun even among the tragedy that Syndey faces. The character of Will worked better when he was an outsider on the verge of finding out the truth. Too bad they couldn't sustain that intensity and Will was forced out of the show. Anyway there aren't many shows like Alias now so the dvd set will keep you entertained.
2,"Good potential, but wasted","The show is certainly exciting, but there are so many inconsistencies in it (plot, characters, etc), so many mistakes, etc. that it really spoils the enjoyment. Some of the plots only work because they assume total stupidity on the parts of people (that otherwise are supposed to be smart) that watching becomes frustrating and annoying. The series would have worked much better if someone had taken the trouble of doing some reality-testing on it (nothing too complex, but would a security-conscious company keep its security codes the same for more than 8 years?!) - such things keep happening. Good raw material, but wasted because of a lack of attention to detail. There are many far better shows available."
5,Alias,"Fast, affordable and easy to order. I couldn't find this in any stores and already having all of the other seasons, it was nice to be able to complete the set. I never saw any of the original shows and now I'm very happy that I can watch it without commercials or the waiting for the next episode. Great show!"
2,"Ok, but lacks something","I started watching this show since it was on latenight TV and I've been trying to appreciate it - but with no luck. Something about this show is not quite right. The ""feel"" of the show is too disjointed and the characters are incredibly bland and lacking in any personality. The lead (Jennifer Garner) has no real redeeming features and lacks any believability in her role. I also feel that the direction of this show is poor - the haphazard away the camera moves to the time shifting of scenes is ludicrous and creates a sense of frustration for the viewer. I know many viewers here enjoy this show but I feel it's nowhere near as good as quality shows like Millennium and certain X-files seasons (3 & 4 mainly)."
1,Complete rip-off of LFN,"I watched the pilot of this show anticpating something wonderful, what I got, however, was a wannabee LFN show with fluff. Jennifer Garner, while attractive, has the emotional depth of a cabbage and the interaction between characters was non-existent. Where LFN was dark, edgy and full of questions, Alias was warm and fluffy, concerning itself with making Sydney look good every episode. If you want to see a good spy show, with great characters and plot, watch the series that inspired this brightly packaged knock-off, watch La Femme Nikita."
1,Boo!,"Alias ia horrible, it's for old 30 year old guys who live with in their parents'basements and fantasize about Jennifer Garner in the bathroom. I'm extremely tired of over-done action dramas and this is a classic example of pure, overcooked shiot. Watch comedy and escape this mess of a genre!"
1,ASTOUNDINGLY AWFUL!!!,"This has got to be one of the most cliche shows I've ever seen. The plot has been done before and Alias makes a mockery of this once extraordinary plot. Jennifer Garner is a very blase actress. She speaks in a monotone and her acting techniques seem very forced. Not to mention the fact that she's too plain-looking to even be starring as a lead in any show. She belongs in character roles, or better yet off the acting stage completely. Her movements are very robotic, forced, and unprofessional. This was once an interesting and provocative plot, but has now been butchered and virtually destroyed by the Alias cast and crew. I wouldn't use these DVD's as a coaster!"
5,Cannot stop watching!!!,"Sure, I am already a fan of Alias, so this review is a bit biased. I bought the season one DVD of Alias for my husband for Christmas and he hasn't been able to watch it. I have been transfixed. The commentary is by far very fun. If you're a fan and want to pick up little tidbits, turn it on. For instance, the writers acknowledge that they never really revealed who was telling Will all the info about SD-6, but do have a backstory planned for a later season. Oooh. I cannot wait. The gag reel is too much fun. I wish it was longer than the four minutes it plays. Seeing the actors laughing, tripping, etc is just really fun."
4,Well done!,"My first experience with TV serials (after long break) was with '24', which I loved. This experince led me to rent dvd with 'Alias' and although this serial is a very good quality entertainment, it's one level below '24'. But, on the other hand, maybe the level was set too high. What makes 'Alias' worth watching is that its creators don't take what they are doing very seriously. It's just pure entertainment. I thought it started a little slow but it picked the tempo later. It is filled with action. Jennifer Garner is great. She is so natural in any surroundings. Other actors are good as well. I was especially impressed by Ron Rifkin: very convincing. All in all it is not a movie where you cannot wait to see the next episode, but still when you watch it you enjoy it."
4,Action packed.,"My husband and I are enjoying Alias. Somehow, we missed it when it originally aired. Alias reminds us of 24 with a female Jack."
5,Great explanation of Tapestry,"Tapestry in Action is another great In Action book. It does a great job of explaining Tapestry with lots of examples. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to develop J2EE applications and needs an alternative to Struts, non-existent JSF, and standard Servlets."
2,Lack details,"this book is not well written. Tapestry is a new way of developing web applications and the author glance through way too many concepts that are essential to understand tapestry web development. For instance, OGNL is havily used by tapestry, but the author does not even bother to spend a little time explaining how it's been used by tapestry. I was left with a lot more questions on tapestry after reading this book. This book only serves as an introduction to tapestry and lacks full coverage. If you buy this book, you will have to spend a lot of time researching the net to find answers to basic question that (I think) should have been addressed by the book. Especially since the author is also the lead developer of Tapestry.Also be aware that this book only covers Tapestry 3.0 and not 4.0"
1,Outdated,"This is a well written book, but it only addresses Tapestry 3. Tapestry 4 and 5 were each complete re-writes. The examples in this book will not work on later versions. I found it slightly useful in understanding some concepts when creating a Tapestry 4 project. Tapestry 5 is much improved, but this book will not help you with it at all."
5,The fundamental book,"This book describes Tapestry 3, while Tapestry 4 will be hopefully released soon, in some aspects quite different from it's predecessor. But still, I would recommend this book to everyone who is going to use Tapestry and who wants to understand the framework. Because Howard, being the creator of Tapestry, shows the main ideas and principles around which the framework was built, and the most important of them do not change with a next release. They only become more efficiently expressed.Having said that, I should warn that this isn't the best book for the complete Tapestry beginners. In a number of cases the author tries to speak at a beginner's level, but he obviously knows too much :) and cares too much for this.However, there is a number of Tapestry tutorials available in the Web, and having started with them, you will definitely want to read this book."
2,great if using this exact version of tapestry because there is no other documentation,"This book is fine if you are using this exact version of tapestry because there is no other documentation. The author does a great job of hiding most documentation from the website so that the only realistic way to use his open source framework is to buy his book. He keeps the forums from being useful by changing the api with each release of tapestry. Even minor version changes aren't always compatible. Its the same with the books. I tried following along with this book using the ""stable"" 4.xx release of tapestry and I had to give up the book. I think this book was written for version 3, and version 5 is totally different."
5,Very dense and clear,"I am learning Tapestry to use it in a project. True the learning curve is high, but with this book you not only learned how to use Tapestry but also the why's and how's behind its design. Chapter 7 (under the hood) and 10 (Implementing a sample application) are particularly good. In all a very dense and clear book suitable for intermediate to advanced readers."
2,Stunning grasp of the obvious,"This book displays a stunning grasp of the obvious. Beyond its plans for some not very interesting do-it-yourself projects, it offers little--trite advice like ""Spending time alone with yourself is an important feature of reflection"" accompanied by an unsatisfying collection of photos. Books like The Japanese House, Simply Zen, and Japanese Style do a much better job of presenting the Zen aesthetic."
4,"Easy, relaxing read","This is a great introductory book to the art of Zen living. Although it seems that the word ""Zen"" has become more and more of a catch phrase, I still must say I enjoy the concepts and ideas that have branched off of it.This book has great pictures and illustrations of very interesting and different spaces. As well, my favourite part, it has helpful ""how-to's"" ... tables, pillows, curtains.. and my personal favourite.. the wall stripe!Give it a try. I borrowed mine from the library and I'm planning to order it online tonite!"
2,Okay but not great,"The book seems marginal and the photos are very disappointing as far as samples and examples of how to incorporate a more zen design in ones home. This will be a book I'll keep but refer to rarely. A bit of a disappointment but not to worry, there are several others to try."
1,Waste of money+effort,"This product is like an online catolog downloaded onto a simple disc. You can have the same catolog on any pocket pc download site (...) and you still get the same games and utilities free that you get in the CD. If you buy a CD with programs on it for 20 dollars, you should not have to pay more for each of the individual 500 things it come with.They give you a [promotional offer] for a reason - it isnt worth anything"
5,An espionage reader,"Enjoyed it immensely. A hard to put down, revealing look at this historical, military, political event of the 1960's. Covering some of Power's CIA training, U2 overflights, downing & capture, Russian trial(farse), imprisonment, possible Oswald & other defectors connection to the U2 shoot down, repatriation through a trade of a pro Russian, US held spy and some of Power's life afterwards."
2,Interesting but...,It is an interesting story and especially coming from the pilot himself but I just could not stay with it - took too long to get anywhere
4,Great Read!,"If you're either interested in history, aviation, or both, you will love this book. Powers goes into details about his U-2 experience that are fascinating, as well as his imprisonment in Russia -- something rarely mentioned anywhere else. A must read for anyone who enjoys military history!"
4,"Great Read, possible signature?","Great book! I bought this for a school project, but got really interested with the story and memoir, and ended up reading it on my own. I had a question, perhaps for the seller? The copy I received was used, and on the title page there is a signature, ""Francis Gary Powers J."" I was wondering if this is an actual signature of FGP Jr., or if it is just a sort of identifier. I think it would be cool if it was an actual signature! If anyone has any idea whether his could be an authentic signature or whether FGP Jr. ever signed these books, I would be very interested to know! Great book, once again!"
3,Great piece of history... not exactly what I expected.,"This book started out very good with some exciting flying stories.. but the whole pace of the book changed once Powers was captured (ok, obviously), but I wasn't expecting the majority of the book to be devoted to his time in captivity. Although interesting to hear the excellent detailed recollection of his time in captivity, I would have loved to hear more about the missions and intricacies of flying the U-2..."
5,"Product review on ""Operation Overflight""",When I ordered this paper back I thought it would a used copy of this book. When it arrived it was a brand new book. So now I have a very nice copy for my Library. Amazon was a pleasure to do business with.
3,FCC License Required!,"I cannot speak to the quality of the device, but only that we are unable to use ours because nowhere on this product's page here is there an indication that the device requires an FCC license. YOU MUST GET AN FCC LICENSE! Go to the FCC website and locate one of the ""Frequency Coordinators"" to complete the application process if you decide that a license is worth the effort and added cost (over $400 half of which is the fee for a 10-year license). Do a web search for the CLS-1110 manual to get detailed specs for easing the application process. I wouldn't have bought this radio if I knew a license was required."
4,A little spendy but worth the price.,"We've had these radios about 2 weeks now, they work great. In buildings they will work easily a half a mile or more (and that is through buildings) Overall, good product, somewhat rugged pretty strait forward. Nice radio."
2,Problems with our Motorola Walkie Talkie Motorola Professional CLS1110 5-Mile 1-Channel UHF Two-Way Radio,"We have had problems with this product. The chargers do not connect well to the walkie talkie. After months of use it is hard to get a good connection when we put the walkie in the charger. We either get a blinking red light, orange light or green light instead of a solid red light which causes the machine to discharge. We also have found that they wear out with less then six months of usage. Two years ago we purchased 7 of them and in February of this year we purchased 4 more. Now we only have six that operate out of the 12 and we are starting to have trouble with some of the remaining ones. We also find that some of them do not last for more then an eight hour period after six months and they are suppose to last 12 hours. We wish we knew what to do since we need them for our staff."
4,"Nice drills, Handy case","13 drill bits in a handy storage case. I'm quite happy with the quality for my home repair uses (primarily drilling in wood).In large part, that happiness is due to my purchase price of ~$6 during an Amazon tool sale."
2,Not great,"VERY dissapointing. Absolutely nothing new here. The same rehash of memory techniques seen before. More than half of the first CD is about brain functions, aging, and Alzheimer's. While I see the rational for understanding how the brain works before working to improve memory, this discussion goes on and on (and on and on and on...) and is extremely redundant. In fact the narrator repeats several basic points and phrases numerous times. Sounds more like someone giving an off-the-cuff talk than a lecture or reading. Very little depth to the info. I have other complaints about this audio book but I think I've said enough."
5,Glorious!,"I have always loved Marc Almond's albums Enchanted and The Stars We Are, which are very lively and mesmerizing. This album is more mature, quieter and deeper. It took me a few weeks to get used to it and now I cherish it as one of the finest albums ever. The song Glorious changed my life. I was an atheist and that song made me a believer! So many good songs on this album. I also love When It's Your Time about death. There is not one bad song on this album. It's almost a meditative album, so serene, relaxing and moving. I love it!"
5,Great movie,"This movie was very good, and very sad.I cannot imagine loosing a child in this was, but had a good outcomeand would recommend."
3,movie rating,"this was a pretty good movie,the actingwasn't so good.overall i would rate itok.wasn't any nasty words to content with"
2,"Very much like Catch-22, but without any fun","At least Catch-22 had some guys you rooted for. Maybe it's me, but I just don't enjoy unrelenting war, stupidity, and greed. There's a tiny bit of wry humor, but nothing I find all that funny. And I just don't like books without any characters that have any redeeming qualities at all."
5,Traditional Psalms,"Do not be fooled by the title, ""A New Translation"". This is the Grail translation that is used by priests and religious throughout the English speaking world. It was done in 1963. There is no playing down of masculine imagery or cutting off of masculine pronouns. The introduction is very helpful in understanding the way in which each psalm is divided. A must own for those who pray the Divine Office."
4,Great for morning and evening prayers!,This book of psalms is a great addition to any prayer time. Music is also easy and understandable!It's definitely worth it...
5,Singing Psalms,"I dearly love this version of the Psalter. Even if you don't follow the chant lines (they're there if you want to use them, but you don't have to of course), the accent marks make it easy to to place the emphasis on the proper words and enjoy the pace of the chant. A truly wonderful addition to your private or communal prayers."
3,More Pilates for Golf,"The exercizes using the ring are good and specific to golf moves.However, the DVD doesn't have segments to tailor the workout, or to skip sections including the instructor's introduction which is way too long to repeat for each use."
1,Needs special ring,"I was personally disappointed with the book, mainly because it requires a special ring to perform most exercises. It didn't mention where you may purchase one either."
5,Highly Recommended!,"M&A tycoon Bruce Wasserstein has not just studied the high-stakes world of corporate mergers & acquisitions, he's lived it. As head of M&A at First Boston and then as leader of his own firm, Wasserstein has played a role in many pivotal corporate marriages. In these pages, Wasserstein comprehensively examines the hows and whys of history's largest deals. While skirting the fundamental question of whether mergers & acquisitions enhance or depress shareholder value over the long term, Wasserstein conveys an overwhelming amount of information about the dynamics and tactics that define M&A. The book is enormous and encyclopedic, so it might serve better as a reference text than a straight-through read. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book for both its compelling historic accounts of Wall Street's most important deals and deal makers and its detailed breakdown of how the game actually works."
2,Classroom lecture,"In reading Big Deal by Bruce Wasserstein, I was hoping to get true inside information from someone who professes to be a big player in the merger and acquisitions market. The first two parts of the book, however, felt more like I was reading a text on the history of mergers in corporate America.Mr. Wasserstein does get around to discussing the strategy involved in doing a deal and also in defending against one in the third part. The impact of this is diluted though due to Mr. Wasserstein's use of glossary definitions to define the terms that he uses.The profiles throughout the book are a nice touch. Big Deal would have been more of a good read if it had focused more on these profile cases and people as opposed to the classroom lecture attitude that was adopted."

1,waste of time,"One insight, one idea, one well written story would have made this book worthwhile. Instead it was the biggest stinker I have ever read. Why did he write this? If you live in the world of business this book is a rehashing of ancient history. If you don't, this book isn't clear enough to explain anything.Skip this book. watch Traders on the lifetime network. You'll learn something there.MP!!!"
3,Items used in the video are the not same ones that came in the kit,"The workout video is great. Unfortunately, the items you need to work out are not in this kit they are in the Gaiam Crosstraining kit. Luckily I bought both. Although they both come with a resistance band the one in the cross train kit is the one from the video and the only one you will be able to use to do some of the exercises. I recommend buying the crosstraining kit and purchasing the video from this workout separately. If I had not bought the other kit this would have been absolutely useless."
3,Good workout...shoddy equipment ball,"I purchased this kit and found it to be a great work out. The equipment ball was not useable though and I ended up going out to purchase another ball. When you recieve your kit you are instructed to fill this ball with air and water. The problem is that it does not seal well and no matter how hard I tried to seal it, I had water leaking out as I worked out."
1,"Very slow, very english, very bad","Yes this may be one of the really bad movies I have ever see.The trailer has everything of any importance that happens in the movie. The reason that the trailer might indeed be far better than the movie is that there are no fake ear piercing screams.Yes scream after scream after SCREAM, I stopped counting after 345 screams.Oh and by the way the cover has nothing to do with the movie nor does the name.Don't even rent this thing......just let it sink into oblivion all by itself."
5,Don't let the small size Scaer you.,"The best little book on James I've read, I liked it so much I got Dr. Scaer's ""Discourses in Matthew"". Don't let the R.C.'s tell you James is a book on works and not faith unless you have first read this book to refute them :) I had his book on Christology but only made it 1/3 in and have not been able to find it since and I'm going to have to put it back on my wish list."
4,"Well written and organized, quite useful","This sourcebook manages to contain not only a timeline of important events in history your players can screw up beyond recognizable states, but a list of various phenomena that can help them muddle in time, various ships, organizations, and other things. Plot hooks are sprinkled throught in a refreshing manner. Some minor quables about repetition, but mostly a good book"
1,Poor Quality,"I cut 17 pieces of 20"" floor tile. Cutting the last few pieces I had to force the tile throught the saw and the last piece took 12 minutes to cut! The replacement blade was of a poor quality."
4,Great,"Took about 45 min to put on, but fits very well and looks and feels high quality. Would buy again."
2,funny!,"We just saw them on an old SNL rerun, and they're really funny! One of them kept dancing and wagging her arms! They can't really sing, though.... Too bad. They have a great stage presence!"
5,warping the lines of expectation...,"Memorable sounds and songs. With subject matter ranging from begging for one's job back,(""Mr. Sellack"" to the relationship patterns we live out(""Runs in the Family"")to everyday hassle we all put up with(""Commuter Train""), the Roche sisters' music runs a nice gamut from nutty to haunting to resigned back to wacko. Their harmonies stand firm against pressure from changing chords beneath, and the result is unforgettable. Their voices, while not necesarily ""beautiful"" in a traditional sense, are so expressive and, well, *real*. This trio can set you up for a heart-wrenching ballad, then skew off on a tangent of silliness. I have seen them perform live, and would probably sacrifice a kidney to do so again. You? Well,... you just give them an ear. :)"
1,Bottle not full!,"I was really excited to get this conditioner, but when it came and I tried to use it for the first time, I had to really squeeze the bottle to get anything out. I stuck my finger in the bottle and only touched the conditioner with the very tip of my finger. It's ridiculous to pay for 33.8 oz and get a bottle that's missing 1/5!! Will never order again."
2,Another Disappointment,"I purchased this video and the Power Yoga for Weight Loss video and am disappointed with both. The Tone and Sweat videos are far more challenging and much better workout.Again, both the new tapes are too short--Weight Loss is only 40 minutes and this is 50 minutes.I would really like to see Bryan make a video of the 90 CD of his class.Sorry Bryan, I really love your style and your Tone and Sweat videos--just not the two new ones.Namaste"
5,Fabulous,"To be honest, I wasn't sure about this DVD to begin with. I already work out regularly to the Energise, Tone and Sweat series and have got used to Bryan Kest strong accent..(I am English) but he just doesn't stop talking all the way through this routine. It grated on me initially but you learn to tune it out. The workout itself is fantastic, a real hip opener! I love his obvious passion and honesty for yoga."
2,No sweat here!,"Well, after being absolutely stiff and sore for days after I started doing BK's original power yoga series, I couldn't wait to try out the new tapes.Bummer. Not very good, I'm sorry to say. The pace is tooooo slow, the moves are fairly basic (although options are given), and it just feels uninspired.If you are just starting, these would probably suffice, but I would recommend that you quickly purchase the entire series from 1995. The only downside is the format--no DVD option on those."
5,great workout,love the original power yoga series with Bryan. This is a great addition and a fun challenge.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This has got to be the worst workout ever, if you even get a workout. I kid you not this video is only forty minutes long, and he talks for the first 20. Not that he ever stops talking throughout. His insipid, trite, uninsightful commentary throughout his ""workout"" made it impossible to concentrate. And it it is neither intense nor advanced. Advanced should require little commentary on basics, like the fact that you need to breathe. I almost couldn't even finish it. I've had better more advanced yoga in my sleep."
1,"An ""Info-Mercial"" of Yoga",This is the goofiest yoga dvd I've seen so far. Borrowed from my Sister and it will go back to her. I really wouldn't consider this a serious yoga practice. It's more of a gym-style workout you'd find in LA ;o)Try Shiva Rea's DVD. It is much better. Check my other yoga reviews on amazon for more.
1,Totally disappointing,"I have been practicing power yoga for two years and I found Brian Kert's dvd totally disappointing. Power yoga isn't a simple physical exercise- and this is the way Brian sees it, or at least this is what his video presents. It's not all about building muscles in every single part of our body; if this is what yoga is then why don't we all work out at our local gym instead. Yoga is all about physical and above all spiritual equininity. In order to get in touch with our inner part and feelings yoga should be practiced in a relaxing place with an instructor who can make his students relax and LET GO, not tense throughout the practice! Brian Kert isn't a professional yogee, he is instead a common trainer for body building and working out with the only difference that he uses some yoga poses instead!!!! So sorry Brian, but if you can't teach yoga stick to the things YOU are good at!"
4,"Good workout, Irritating listening","I love the workout, but really have to try to tune the commentary out (I have to skip that lengthy introduction altogether). I think much of the talking is used as a distraction while you are holding poses; however, his occasional grammar lapses and attacks on gyms are a bit irritating. I do listen intently to his pose instructions and feel each time I play the DVD, I improve. Picture quality leaves a lot to be desired, but that's not such a big deal (who's watching anyway). I have not used the tape long and feel a great deal more limber and improved."
1,This guy talks too much..I wish he'd just get to the workout,"I've bought a lot of yoga videos and this ranks among the worst. Normally you can select a chapter to avoid all the talk...well not with this DVD. You get a talking chapter and you get a chapter that's supposed to start the workout, only it actually just starts more talk. Then when the workout really starts it's hard to follow because his verbal directions are so poor. This DVD has the potential to be good if he would stop talking and give better directions. With all the DVDs out there you can do a whole lot better than this one!"
4,Good Challenge for Beginners,"This DVD is a good investment for a home collection. All of the poses are attainable, nothing too fancy, but the workout is great. It is an especially strong leg workout. I have been doing this DVD for a year now, and have not tired of it. It was my first DVD and has proved a good foundation to get into other types of yoga. I highly recommend it!"
3,The First of the modern Pilates books,Very interesting read. It shows Pilates at a time where it wasn't yet on everyone's mouth so it is closer to the work of Joe. Whether you like that or not is a different matter.
4,Thoroughly Satisfied,This book is an old print (before I was born actually) but it is exteremely easy to follow along with and contains all the information you need to understand the basics of Pilates.
5,Six for the deep freeze,"Robert Service is great reading at any temperature but this selection of his best known works from the Yukon are perfect to be stashed in your duffel for that snowy camp, brought out late at night while the moon is rising, the campfire is dying down, the cold is filtering into your mukluks and the night sounds creep into camp. Then whip out an enthusiastic rendition of The Cremation of Sam McGee- Service's work is meant to be read aloud- and you'll create memories that can't be duplicated in the warm confines of the living room!"
2,Toaster is poorly designed with cheap features.,"First of all, thanks to Amazon's return process - This could be shipped back with little hassle. The Toaster has a door that falls open until the handle hits the counter. Just seems like the first of what could be many design flaws. To toast - a dial is turned which then clicks its way back to the start position. It makes a cheap ticking noise as the dial is ""un-winding"" back to the off position. If you stop the toast part way through - the unwinding keeps going, or you can force the cheap plastic knob to the off position.I was not ready to keep assessing for design flaws - I returned DeLonghi to order the cuisinart classic broiler/toaster oven as it is a simpler and better built unit."
2,Power Station Glacier GBA,It's okay as long as you have an electrical out let right next to you not good for long road trip's though so be for warned. Good luck and Buy this product if you like playing your Original GBA inside a lot.
5,Oh YES ! Hayden !,Franz Joseph Haydn is right up there with the MOZART and BACH Composers. Haydn has that special touch and his music grows on one self. I have started collecting his works and It really is quite good and enjoyable makes a person want the whole collection of Haydn.
4,"Fast, convenient tool with unpredictable results","All my life I've been using regular glass thermometers. Therefore, I developed that feeling of what it's gonna display when I feel like this or like that. This new digital one is an excellent piece, it comes back fast and I like that it flashes red when it feel the fever. I also like that I can switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit, because I am used to Celsius while doctors here just don't get anything but Fahrenheit.What puzzles me is that sometimes what it shows is not what I feel like. What concerns me is that I can't really trust what I read when I use it on my infant.Other than that - terrific product. I like the idea of changing the probes, a very convenient drawer for the probes.A little bit too big to carry around (light, but bulky for a diaper bag full of stuff),unlike the glass one or other digitals), but it's the price of multiprobs, I guess.Came in fast too."
1,Find something else. . .,"Calling all entrepreneurs - you could make a lot of money if you came up with a decent kids' thermometer: if this model is one of the highest rated thermometers here - that's a sad statement. We've been using this for 2.5 years now with my daughter and I'm finally fed up.Yes, it's nice that it has 3 attachments for taking temps. And. . .it would great if it took temperature accurately. Problem: it doesn't.What's Bad: 98% of the time we have to take temperature multiple times to get near any sense of accuracy.So you might think - oh it's your child wiggling around. Nope, I finally just took my temperature using the oral gauge and my temperature came out to be 97.3. And no, I don't have the flu right now and, no, I wasn't dancing around when I took it."
1,only worked two days; waste of money,"I bought this to finally have something that I could use for both my children, especially my two year old when he was sleeping. It worked for two days, was kept in its protective bag and used correctly. Now it will only read ""hi"" for body temperature. It is useless and a terrible waste of money. since I cannot return it, I will think twice before ever ordering from Amazon again."
1,"Junk, Avoid this item","I have yet to find a decent quality baby thermometer on Amazon.com. This looked like the best of the worst to replace our simple $7 basal thermometer. We were excited to receive the item only to open it and find an incredibly cheap looking item. The plastic is thin, the plastic cord is cheap, the entire unit does not look like a $45 thermometer. Many reviews on Amazon note that the temperature readings are low, we noticed on an average male adult the average temperature readings were 96.8 degrees. This item went back in the box and is being returned to Amazon when we hear back from the outside seller. Very dissatisfied with this item, we're thinking about checking out the some IR thermometers that are well rated."
1,VERY inaccurate,I have bought two of these and they read very low. They both say something different even when taking the temps seconds apart...and they are both way low.
5,Great Product,"It looks great, works well. The compartment to hold the extra pieces is really handy, they don't get lost! Definitely worth the money."
3,Its ok,"I Purchased this thinking it was pretty close to what they had our preemie use at the hospital, and for the most part this is pretty close.It doesnt seem to be much more accurate then the cheapo thermometers, and is more or less just as quick. The only reall difference is that it gives you the color code when it returns the result for ok or fever.The back end where it stores the other parts is not the beset quality, if you are fairly strong you will pull it out too far each time as I do and that gets fairly annoying sometimes.Also its not terribly easy to switch the ends/leads out or to even put one on in the first place, you need to have light and they only fit in one way."
1,Looks and feels like a toy,"This unit looks and feels like a toy, the underarm sensor is hard to use and too big for a newborn - it was impossible to get a good reading (which also takes ages). Ultimately, just don't trust this product, feels like something you'd get from a joke shop."
2,wstephens,"I give this product 2 stars for the variety of thermometers within one product, but the temperature always seems to be very low. I will need to purchase another thermometer, which is a disappointment."
4,Great thermometer,Very easy to use. I'm a new mom and it provides great ease of mind to know I can check my baby's temp whenever I want and it works every time. I love the three different attachments. The only issue I have had is the armpit attachment sometimes reads error.
3,"Works decently, but not as advertised","First, let me say that this thermometer has a handy design, and it is very nice to have three separate attachments for oral, underarm, and anal readings. I have a couple of problems with it, though. First, it is supposed to give a reading in 5 seconds. It takes much longer than that, and often turns off before getting a reading. Second, the underarm measurements are consistently low, though the probes are supposed to lead to pre-calibrated readings. Third, about half the time, the green/red lights don't light up. Perhaps I simply got a ""lemon""? In spite of these drawbacks, though, it is a nice thermometer kit. If you buy it, just test yours first with normal body temperature so you can calibrate and know if the readings are consistently high or low, and by how much. Then you can simply add or subtract when it comes time to make a judgement about fever."
4,The workshop book of knitting,"I've gotten this from the library a number of times. It is a well explained and sophisticated knitting book for children. It has great projects, which build upon each other in difficulty, including socks with heels and raglan sweaters, but also pom-poms and doll beds. I'm sorry it is out of print also."
5,This is where it all began,I tried to read Lovecraft when I was 12 and hated it. I got this book (in it's first edition) when I was about 17 and absolutely loved it. The good guys always die or go crazy in the end - I can't think of a better way for a horror story to end.Now I'm 29 and Lovecraft is tied with Tanith Lee and Anne Rice for my favorite author. The story didn't end but I'm already crazy (probably from reading these twisted tales).
2,Buy the Black and decker Home improvement book instead,"I was expecting this book to ""speak"" to dummies. But unfortunately through out the book they kept bringing up stuff that had not been explained before. There is too much verbage and not enough step by steps or pictures. As for humor, all you have are the cartoons.The Black and decker book starts from the basics, shows each and every tool that is required to do the job, shows plenty of pictures that give the best idea as to what is involved and what is requried."
2,Better than nothing...,"I was hoping that this book would give me a solid introduction to home improvement but it really didn't deliver. The information presented tended to be either too brief or assumed a lot of proir knowledge, which is inappropriate in a book with ""for Dummies!"" in the title. There were some good tips but I never had enough info to embark on a project with only this book as a reference. One exception was the info on painting, which was helpful and detailed. Also, a lot of the material seemed a little dated - there was tons of info about wallpapering and installing laminate countertops (I think these options are not as popular as they once were) but not much on installing granite counters or laminate flooring. So, in short, having this book is better than nothing but if you really want to be well versed in home improvement, look elsewhere."
3,Item Not As Pictured,"I ordered this thinking I would be getting the full set. However, it is just the extra heavy picks all in a light translucent yellow. I am fine with the product, the brand is my favorite. However, I don't think I needed extra heavy- just a novice ordering job."
2,Easy to read but why bother?,"Even though I read this really quickly and I enjoyed reading it. Allison Penny doesn't seem like a real character to me. Yes, she made me laugh, and I could empathize with her feelings. However, her character did things that didn't seem believable for someone who has felt ugly her whole life. She wakes up beautiful and suddenly has confidence to spare? I think there would still be vestiges of her former hermit-like self there.Granted this was a modern sort of fairytale but the characters were too caricature like. They didn't have much depth and their behaviors, except for Allison, were too predictable.It is a quick, easy read but there is something missing."
1,One of the worst I've read...,"This book was awful. The plot, the characters, the writing ... the author was exceptionally lazy. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The premise is intriguing, but the author completely avoids any and all opportunity to take the plot and the characters anywhere. I bought this book in an airport and had a hard time forcing myself to read it on the plane--SkyMall was more appealing!!!"
4,Entertaining,"This is the story about an overweight, exceptionally homely woman who wakes up one morning with the body and face of a supermodel.The story doesn't try to explain how this happened, and for me this wasn't a problem. Once you accept the premise, I felt the author did have some interesting things to say about Beauty, and how powerful a force it is in our culture.I give this book 4 stars because I thought it was a quick, fun, entertaining read. It's not simply a Revenge book, although it's that. It's also a mirror on how our society works."
3,"I laughed, I cried","I enjoyed this book (except for a few of the sex words--but I think that's because I'm in my 40's). As an overweight woman, I could really relate to some of the painful experiences Allison had. I would have liked to know the secret behind the change in her appearance but there's probably nothing that would have made any sense, so you just suspend disbelief. No matter how often we hear that it's inside beauty that counts, we all know that's never enough. But if Allison had not been a bright, funny, and good person, she would not have found happiness either."
3,pretty book but weird story,Illustrations are nice but the story itself is weird that the train breaks down...I find this a little bit odd that the Dinotrain broke down:)
4,fun and giggles,"This book is full of bright and colorful illustrations and a rhyming dino-themed story that is sure to please a younger audience. I thought the adventures these dinos had aboard the dino-train were every bit as fun as the other books in this series. There is one thing about these books though, parents be warned: the kids never want you to read them just once. If you have ever had a song stuck in your head for days, this is what this book is like. After the third time or so, the dino-train is a dino-pain! great book!"
2,SOO disappointing,"I heavily rely on reviews when I purchase any item, and I wish I had taken another reviewer seriously when they said this book was a downer. It really is! The illustrations are great, but the story line is negative from almost the first page. In summary, this train has problems running from the very beginning, crashes and the dinosaurs get off wondering why they took a trip. It doesn't exactly inspire children to try new things! My son is crazy about dinosaurs and trains and he wasn't into this book as much as I tried to make it interesting. My husband read this to our son on a different night, without any input from me, and told me afterward that he felt the same way.....boring and negative. Every child is different and again, the illustrations really are fantastic, but it's just not enough to make this something we'll read again. Sorry to be a downer myself, but I wanted to share with others who might be considering..."
2,Boring,"Kids like trains. Kids like Dinosaurs. What could go wrong? Well, for one, the writing is pretty bad. Every third line sacrifices meaning for rhyme (nice, hu?). At the end all the dinosaurs hug for no other reason than it rhymes with chug and trains move like ""slugs"" (guess why!). Tunnels have funnels now? Really? And every time the syllables don't line up, the author picks a work and slaps ""dino"" infront of it (dinotime, dinoshouts, etc). The illustration is okay and my son likes it well enough. It probably all doesn't matter, but even if it's totally irrational, you want your kid exposed to quality art, right? Besides, you're not going to want to read this thing out loud. It's just awkward."
1,Left Me With Too Many Answers,"Despite the fascinating data in this book or because of it, I now have more questions than the book provided answers for. Now I will have to read more of L Ron Hubbard's books and hope I can find the answers to the questions this book raised. I would have preferred more depth to this book, but that's just me. Inquiring minds and all that..."
3,Too Brief,"Good book, fascinating concepts. I thought that I was getting the ""unabridged"" version, but that seems not to be the case. Although this version describes briefly what Mr. Hubbard's science is and how it came to be, I was disappointed in it's cursory nature."
4,Bell quality at a great price,I paid $8 for this seat bag. Nothing special... it does what it is supposed to do. Sits securely under seat.Bell is one of the best names in biking accessories so it will last.
5,Stowaway,"Very useful product, easily installed. We'll see how the velcro straps hold up under ""pressure"""
1,I haven't even gotten it yet and dissapointment can't cover it,"I just now got notified it was being sent to me, 9 days after I ordered it, omg I swear if I need something that important I will either get something that comes from amazon warehouses directly, go get it in person or just go without. The timeframe in which this company sends out things they charge you for the minute you order it but you wont get it for a longer period and that is after they finally mail it. If I could have given it no stars I would have, customer service truly is pathetic with this company or maybe the fact I only bought a lower priced item so they figure my order can sit around and gather dust, even though the product I order they had plenty and were instock of it."
3,It works but,"This bag works well but I expected a Bell bag to fit perfectly on a Bell seat. NOT SO. If the velcro seat straps were 2 inches longer it would attach better and more securely. I carry a spare tube, a multi tool and a small bottle of White Lightning (gear lube that is) in mine. There is a tiny bit of room left but with any more weight in there I think the short velcro straps would lose their grip and the bag would be daggling by only the seat post strap.(This strap does seem adequate) I am planning to remedy the weak straps with medium duty nylon tie wraps. Then, spoken like Groundskeeper Willie, I will say in a scotish brogue, ""There, that should doo it""."
3,"Great for smooth trails, Not so great for bumpy rides.","I have had this same basic bag about ten years. Most of that time I was only riding paved surfaces, and just wanted a place to put my cell phone and garage door opener. Here recently I took it on its first mountain biking experience and wanted it to hold a tube, tire levers, and a bike tool. The bag has no problems holding the tool, tire levers, and tube when you ride a fairly smooth surface, but when I started bumping on the rougher surfaces of the mountain bike trails, the hook and loop closures on the top did not hold the weight. In all fairness I was only able to use a smaller portion of the hook and loop to hold it due to the way the seat is on my bike. If you are able to use all of it, you may have better luck, however if your going to go bouncing down a mountain bike trail, I would look for an option that uses more than a hook and loop closure. If your riding smooth paved trails, this bag will be fine."
2,Poor zipper,"I used this bag for 100 miles before the zipper pried open during a ride. Part of the problem was that my bicycle pump (6 5/8"" long) was putting some pressure on the bag, but it wasn't severe pressure, so I don't think this should have caused the zipper to become un-toothed (I made up a word, so what?). Finishing a long ride worrying about your stuff falling out unnoticed is no fun, but I did bang the ends of the zipper down to prevent it from happening again. It now seems to function, but it's not a smooth zippering and I have to test it out -- all the while wondering if it'll open up again. I wouldn't recommend this bag. I mean, bike bags have to do two things: stay closed and stay on. This bag does a poor job of staying closed. The velcro straps have worked fine for me, so it has stayed on just fine."
2,Spend a few more bucks!!,"This was a great low price and high reviews. This is not a good choice for longer rides. I went on a 36 mile ride and had to stop about 9 times to fix due to the velcro straps under the seat getting loose. I had a patch kit, tube, cell, and keys in the bag. There is a lot of room and I could have fit more but I do not recommend unless you are doing very short ride with very light weight. Spend the few extra dollars for a better system."
1,rotted out,Had this bag for about two years. seams on the bottom are rotting out. Zipper design is poor as it opened a little bit while riding and lost a set of keys. $75.00 to replace the car key. Spend a few bucks more and get a better bag.
3,Not so tough,"Bought this same bag at Walmart. Pleased with the mounting and the space; but the bag only lasted about a month. Majority of rides were through metro at lunch (roads and curbs) plus a couple trails. It has ripped out the stitching along the bottom side and along the top. It was carrying spare tube, patch kit, multi tool, tire levers, keys and c-card/cash."
3,Fine for lightweight objects,"I bought this bag because it looked like the right size to stow our medium-duty bike lock when my family and I go biking. Unfortunately, the velcro straps could not support that much weight when going over bumpy terrain.My wife was testing it out and rode over a wooden bridge. On the way off the bridge, one of the straps came loose and the pack came in contact with the rear tire and got abraded pretty badly. She had to re-secure the straps and then ride very carefully for the rest of the trip.This bag is probably fine for carrying light objects on paved roads, but it wasn't quite up to the task for our needs."
2,Wrong picture on this item,I actually bought this bike bag because the one I bought at Walmart didn't seem to fit very well. The top strap was too far toward the zipper opening for it to be threaded under the seat springs and the result is that these straps disengage very easily. The picture of this bike bag indicated that the straps were set back toward the seat and that the zippered opening was actually a bit more functional. Surprise!!! No such luck. Exactly the same bag as is carried at Walmart with exactly the same problem. Teaches you not to trust the pictures.
1,crappy product,would not buy this again and will not use what I purchased. will take it to the goodwill and get rid of it
1,stuck riding,I can't figure the thing out. How does it mount to anything. I must be stupid or something. I bought a $50 thing from an expensive company that is a rack/bag combo just to get relief. The thing drags on my wheel and the straps don't match up and down or sidewayssigneddummy
2,Didnt fit my bike seat,I was hoping to put this on my Trek mountain bike but the straps that fasten it into place are in a spot that wont fit on my bike. I just have the stock seat so its not a one bag fits all
3,Poor quality,"The bag is fine, but it did not last long. The fabric has frayed through. It's cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"functional, but disappointing","I bought two of the Bell STowAways. One at a local retailer for my husband, and one from Amazon. The StowAway from the retailer attaches to the seat with a screwed on connector. Very nice and secure. The Amazon one has velco and has come loose on SEVERAL rides."
1,Lousy zipper,"I bought this at walmart. I put a 15mm wrench, 2 tubes, a patch kit and extra patches in it. I also put in print-out maps, gels, and shot-bloks in it as needed. After only a couple of months the zipper failed, and just won't work anymore."
2,Zipper broke very quickly,"Had the zipper not broken very soon after I started using it, I'd think a lot more of this bag. It holds plenty. I used a plastic cable tie to better fasten it to the seat. I agree with other reviewers that the velcro straps aren't the most secure.I don't believe I abused the zipper in one or two of the first uses. I was able to keep it jury-rigged enough to use it for a season, but I'll be replacing it in the spring. If you buy this bag (and I don't recommend you do), I recommend you baby it."
1,straps are stupid and useless,"the straps that go under the seat dont make sense, its like the velcro is in the wrong spots... i got it attached as tight as i could and it would sag down and drag on the wheel, i had to zip tie it to the seat to work. Horrible design."
1,broke the first day,"Bought this at WalMart, but I thought it would be a decent bag because Bell is a good brand. The zipper broke within the day of buying it. Pay a little extra and get a better one."
1,It keeps falling down,The velcro straps on top don't hold it in place. Every ride I've had with it (2 separate bags) has seen it fall down and rub against the back tire. Not recommended.
3,not all that meets the eye,"the main problem with this product is that the picture is not the same as the real product. the zipper is not a side to side deal as shown but more of an arch , this really isnt a problem in that it hurts the functionality of the bag. there is also not as much reflective tape on the bag as shown. the bag is good for carrying a wallet cell phone and a bag of snacks, but if you want more space than that look for something else."
2,"Nice capacity, but poorly fastened","I have used this bag while riding single-track trails. It is constantly coming unfastened from the bottom of the saddle. Fortunately, it has never disconnected from the seat post, so I have not lost it completely. It is still a hastle that could have been avoided with better design.Like I said in the title, it has plenty of capacity for a spare tube, tire levers, keys, etc... If you're just riding on pavement, it's probably fine."
2,"Decent bag, but poor construction","I thought this bag was fine until I loaded it up. I had my lube bottle pressed against its top slightly, and overnite it ripped a hole in the bag. This bag ripped far too easily. I'm really done with cheap products-this includes Schwinn and Bell. Better to pay a few bucks more and get a quality product that you can depend on."
1,Bad Zipper,"I had this bag attached to my bicycle all year. I use it to stash emergency tools (i.e. spare tube, 10 in 1 tool, flashlight...). The zipper broke after about 6 months of lite use. A bag with a bad zipper is unreliable. Spend the extra $$$ and pass on this item."
3,"Holds a lot, but the zipper is cheap","I bought this at K-Mart for around $8. Sometimes you get what you pay for. I should have checked the zipper before i took it out of the store. The zipper can easily run off the tracks if you're not careful, however the more i use it the less it runs off the tracks so its possible that it just needs breaking in. We'll see.On the other hand, it does hold quite a bit.For long rides mine holds:WalletKeysTire IronsMulti-use Tool (Hex Bits / Philips / Flathead)Spare InnertubeFor short neighborhood rides:Multi-use ToolPear or AppleSandwichBag of CrackersYou can't beat it for the price, just mind the zipper."
2,Velcro Does Not Work,"The bag is good... but the velcro straps used to attached it to the bike frame are not strong enough. I've had to use zip ties to get it to hang on (and that looks sloppy), otherwise it falls off the moment you hit a bump in the road."
3,Unstable,"This is a perfect size saddle bag for fitting personal items such as phone (Blackberry) money, keys, bike lock and a little snack bar. However, the top velcro that is suppose to hold on the bottom of the saddle doesn't fit and it wont' stay put. Eventually, somewhere in the middle of my rides it disconnect from the top and only hangs from the saddle bar, so I get worried that it might fall off and I lose all my important objects."
2,bicycle seat bag,"I didn't like this item, because the strap won't stay fastened, and, it's too small."
2,Horrible Bag,"This was a horrible bag. It only lasted me about 3 rides on the trail. The zipper wouldn't zip anymore because it wouldn't stay in the groove when zipping it up. The fabric kept getting caught on the zipper when zipping. After a couple times opening it, the zipper already started to break where it wouldn't close anymore. If you want something that will last you, then I suggest you get something else cause even though Bell = Big Company........they have some products that are just below par."
4,Good seat bag...,"This is a strong seat bag. The velcro straps work fine to hold it firmly to the seat, and the zipper is good quality."
2,bad quality,"This product, in my opinion is bad quality. the zipper has already busted after a few mild rides. For that one reason i'm giving this 2 stars. other than that it is great, but without a zipper, i can't use it."
5,Perfect,"I was looking for a nice little bag to fit under the seat of my wife's bike so that she could carry misc. items like keys, money and camera. This bag works great, and it even has a little loop to hold the rear flashing light."
2,Poor storage,"Poor storage and not flexible in terms of mounting. If you already have other things mounted on the rod, it will be really hard to mount it and attach it to the chair."
5,useful purchase,"bought this product for my boyfriend who bikes to work everyday. This compact stow away pouch fits his house keys, work badge, glasses with its bulky case, wallet, and cell phone. It fits securely on the bike, but he likes to strap it on the front of the bike just in case the velcro straps were not strapped on properly."
3,Small and only velcro fasteners,"It only has velcro fasteners. It is very small. You cannot put much of anything required to fix a flat; or even put a chain in it, because it only has those velcro fasteners."
5,A pure masterpiece,"'Sultans of Swing', of course, is a classic but this self titled album by Dire Straits is possibly one of the best debuts in classic rock history. Mark Knopfler is (simply put)a guitar genius that belongs in the company of classic rock masters like Hendrix, Clapton, Page, Santana, Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, etc. Polished to the hilt, this first album by Dire Straits is a must own for lovers of any rock guitar virtuoso like Knopfler."
4,Great Debut!,"First off, Im not really a Dire Straits fan. This is because I basically only like their first two albums.Later on they would get to MTV for my tastes.This Dire straits debut is a fine album. All the songs rock, and they sound anything but commercial. except maybe for ""Sultans of swing"" but then only because the airplay, the song itself rocks.It starts off great with ""Down on the Waterline"", and ""Water of Life"" is beautiful. So are all the songs here. Because both Knopflers where playing here, you can hear TWO guitars !(the sound I miss in all the albums after Communique]."
4,The only good decent Dire Straits album,"Dire Straits was in my opinion an overrated band.I only liked their debut album as it contained two great songs in Sultans of swing and Down to the waterline.I have found their remaining albums dull and dreary.I would recommend you to get this along with albums from the Rolling Stones,The Who and Led Zeppelin and avoid all their other albums."
2,Still dull,"Bought it when I was 10 because I liked Sultans of Swing. Hated the rest of it. Well, I was 10; it was adult music. Got rid of it.Bought it again at 38 in a bargain bin. It hasn't improved for me. Dire Straits recorded half a dozen great songs over 7-8 years, but 'Sultans' is the only one on show here. There's nothing exactly wrong with the others - they're just not especially good songs when you measure them against thousands of others recorded over the last 50 years or so. They deserve a certain degree of respect; the rest is a question of taste."
4,Dire Straits Debut From 1978 Not Immediately Striking.,"I understand that when this one came out few fans or music critics in the the UK or elsewhere gave it much attention.At the time punk rock had followed on from glam rock, on the way to the new wave genre. None of these were ever my favourites.Then some European radio stations started to play Sultans Of Swing and the single took off all over the world, bringing the album in it's wake.Apart from Sultans Of Swing, I had very little knowledge of the remainder, although Down To The Waterline is excellent.The rest have taken time to grow on me, but there is much to enjoy at a time when the band played without excessive keyboards and horns.Bob Dylan was certainly listerning as he quickly enlisted Mark Knopfler on guitar and Pick Withers on drums for his 1979 album, Slow Train Coming."
4,"I, too, think their first album was their best","And, pretty much, they go downhill with each album thereafter. Making Movies and Love Over Gold are well worth the money. Anything after that ... well ... probably not. Borrow an MP3 from a friend..."
5,Their first album is also the best,"Dire Straits's debut album gets the nod for also being their best-ever recording; and not just because it includes the classic ""Sultans of Swing."" Great songs abound and leader Mark Knopfler guitar stylings, almost blues-like at times, have never been better. Hard to decide which songs are the best, though ""Down to the Waterline,"" ""Water of Love,"" and ""Wild West End"" could certainly fit the bill. Overall, not a bad song in the mix. Few rock bands have ever had debut albums as accomplished and polished as this."
3,OVERPLAYED ROCK SONG,"First of all, I like this one better than Brothers in arms. Butstill all I hear on the radio is Sultans of Swing, and Money forNothing. Dosen't that kind of get sick of you??They're OVERPLAYED...I still love that song anyway, and it is one ofthe band's best songs. Listen to this....."
1,an overrated Dire Straits album.,"I've thought last night that this is one of the Dire Straits worst albums in my music guide. Some of the worst songs I have ever heard from this great band seem to appear in Water Of Love, In The Gallery, and Wild West End. I mean the vocals are crappy, so as the music. The only good song is Sultans Of Swing. This is a bit overrated Dire Straits along with Making Movies, Communique, and Alchemy. The 3 that I recommend such as Brothers in Arms, Love Over Gold, and On Every Street are actully listenable. Go buy those 3 insted!!! Don't listen to the 5 star reviewers too. SUCKS!!!!"
1,How come this cd is so popular???,"This is probably the worst Dire Straits album of all theirs. Every of their other albums are fine. This is the only bad 1 which contains several of the worst songs they ever recorded.I will have to say that Sultans of Swing is the only decent song on this terrible album. Listen to that, the other songs are terrible. And one more thing, Why is it so popular??????????"
5,masters from the beginning,"Dire Straits first album is a winner. Right from the beginning these guys had something special going on, and they knew it. They were really good at the whole ""soothing rock with incredible guitar playing"" style they distinctly had. Nobody had a sound or style like these guys back in the late 70's, though many have tried to copy what Dire Straits were masters at.Of course, if there's one negative with the band it's that most of their songs sound the same. You either like the style or you don't. If you like ""Sultans of Swing"" you will like the rest of the album. That's almost a guarantee. ""In the Gallery"" is very similar to that song in every way, and ""Wild West End"" is just a slightly softer track with light country influences. If you like one song, you will like the entire album."
5,An amazing debut,"I still love listening to Knopfler's guitar. He reminds me a lot of David Gilmour, who never played fast or flashy but still managed to add his signature sound in all the right places at all the right times.This is not the MTV, hit-after-hit, music that came later with Brothers In Arms. Instead, this is a nice intro to a band that would stick around to give us a lot of great music. And Mark still makes great music."
4,Let's Go Down To The Waterline!,"I love this song, Down to the Waterline, and it is one of myfavorite DS songs!! I play it 3 times in a row! Others great would be Six Blade Knife, the single, Sultans of Swing, and Lions."
4,The Quintessential Dire Straits Album,"If you want one Dire Straits cd, this is it. Sure, everybody loves ""Sultans of Swing,"" but the real strength of this album is the first side. In fact, for Best Album Side, I'll nominate this right along with Rush's A-side on ""Moving Pictures.""""Down to the Waterline"" is vintage Knopfler, ""Water of Love"" and ""Six Blade Knife"" are pure, solid grooves, accented by excellent drum work by Pick Withers. ""Setting Me Up"" is irresistible. Avoid the overrated ""Best Of"" albums by Dire Straits. THIS album is their ""Best Of."""
3,Fantastic album arrived slightly warped,A 1978 album in audiophile finish remastered - producing amazing quality sound and doing justice to the band - after having survived a rather tight packing that warped the album a bit. Quite fitting - Dire Straits - Dire Straits!
5,Excellent album classic Dire Straits,If you're a die-hard Dire Straits fan you'll love this album. Great to listen to & dance to. A real pleasure.
5,Dire Straits SHM-SACD,This SHM-SACD has a high quality song. Everything is clear and detailed. The album brings the song from 1978 and not a modern song. Very audiophile quality. Deserve a chance!
4,Great Debut from Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler,"Dire Straits Debut, released 1978.This was the original album from Dire Straits containing one of the biggest and earliest well known song, 'Sultans of Swing', and more such as 'Down to the Waterline', 'Six Blade Knife', and 'Lions'. You get great metal in 'Setting Me Up' and 'Southbound Again', quite good. This album is quite goodso buy it, the only bad songs are In The gallery, Water of Love's just a joke, and Wild West End.Thank you and I hope you read my review."
2,Dire Sound Quality,"I usually look forward to and love buying re-mastered CDs as the technology of today is so much better than when CDs were first released in the 80s. I never owned this on CD until now but must say that there is something very wrong in the sound of this remastered version. The mid-range is skewed, burying the vocals, almost like you are listening to it through glass. Very surprising for a such a great Dire Straits recording."
2,Is not what was in the picture,"The Zebra in the picture is one that we have had for a couple years and my daughter takes it everywhere with us. I tried purchasing a new one and doing a ""swap"" with the one that was starting to fall apart. Well the one sent was close but not exactly like the one pictured. If you are looking to replace a well loved toy then I would suggest trying to find another way to purchase it."
2,"Great reading, lousy story","Like all of the Fonolibro audio books that I've listened to, 'La Dama de Las Camelias' has top notch narration and voice acting, and great production values. Unfortunately, unlike some of their other CD's, the story this is based on is excruciatingly boring. If you want to practice your Spanish and listen to a decent story in the process, I'd recommend 'Harry Potter Y La Piedra Filosofal' or Fonolibro's 'Viaje Al Centro de la Tierra,' and 'El Conde de Monte Cristo.'"
3,Hindemith: A brilliant composer leading a mediocre orchestra,"Hindemith, a brilliant musical master mind is unjustly represented in this CD. The quality of the orchestra is subpar, this can be heard by the several missed notes, poor intonation and unbalanced technique. The musical phrasing however is superb, thanks to Hindemith's genious of conducting."
3,Lyrics poorly articulated,"Although EMH is a favorite artist, this album may be good, but, I don't like to have to work to understand the lyrics. In this CD, she seems to mumble the words. I suppose that is an artistic style. I just don't like it."
5,"I am not really a big country music fan,but...","Emmylou Harris has one of the greatest voices I have ever heard.This early work is fantastic.The title cut rocks!""Pancho And Lefty""is an all-time classic.As usual on her albums there is an excellent cover of a song from a great rock/rock and roll artist;in this case her rendition of Chuck Berry's ""C'Est La Vie"" is delightful.Solid or better than the rest of the way,too.And the band is brilliant!"
5,Stunning Recording from a singing legend.,"Simply one of the finest ""new"" country albums ever recorded. Even years later, the musicianship and notes still thrill and entertain. A ""must have"" CD."
5,Husband fun,"My husband is the one who really listens to music a lot, most of the time while he excersizes. He has a walking problem so focusing on music helps him while he walks on a treadmill"
2,Weak Trek,"When I first popped this tape into the 'ol VCR I thought this might be pretty good. But then I saw the UGLY side of Picard. I would think that Ira Steven Behr (the writer) would know his character, but wrote Picard as an ediot and a big meanie in this episode. I hate to say it, but this was a very weak episode. I love TNG, but everybody has to make an episode at 5:00 on Friday I suppose."
5,A diesel essential,These are good quality fuel filters that work perfectly on the GM 6.5l diesels. Just make sure you get the gasket on right and don't forget about the screen which will sometimes get stuck in the filter and you should have no problems with these.
1,Do not buy Copy protect,After recieving this item I found out it is copy protect. I did not open the schrink wrap so I could return this. I only listen to music now from my Ipod. Thi smeans that I cannot purchased copy protect CD's. It would be nice if Amazon could give us a warning about this before we order an item.
1,"Highly irritating. Interesting premise, but poorly executed.","The scenario of the film, while interesting, was handled very poorly. I was frequently annoyed by this film. It does have some redeeming aspects; however, I cannot recommend it."
4,REFRESHING AND DIFFERENT FROM THE TYPICAL ROMANTIC COMEDY,"A romantic comedy that takes a totally different approach and actually pulls it off. Mostly. Christopher Eigeman, who I remember fondly from BARCELONA, plays a contemporary Woody Allen type character who suffers insecurities even though he knows what he needs to do and even though he studies philosophy when he isn't teaching English Lit to his private school students. Ian Holm plays a serious psychologist to the main character forcing him forward and then haunting his subconscious after he has long left his therapist. Look for the closet scene. Good chemistry between the two lovers. Oh, and guys, the next time you have to watch a romantic comedy with your woman you may want to try this one out instead of the diluted overdone fairy tale love stories. MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 09/18/2010."
2,so-so info...not too deep,This book could have been a little deeper...precanned scripts...nothing special
3,Cookbook of scripts,"I am mildly disappointed in this book. When I read the title and description, I thought it would be a discussion on the various topics presente. This instead turns out to be pre-cooked scripts that you can use out-of-the-book, or modify to suit your environment. I was looking for a meatier book that would help uncover the secrets of ADSI and the WinNT provider, explicity, without going thru the 100lbs of Windows 2000 Resource Kit. For example, the WinNT provider is covered in 75% of a single page.I would recommend this for beginner admins who need quick answers to common problems. I would not consider this the first-line of answers for advanced admins who need to deal with customized solutions in a multi-domain or international environment."
3,"Good book, but no soft copies of code","The book is well written, but to practically try the script codes you have to type it manually from the book.The online code dump, as advertised by the author, does not exist."
2,Update: Scripts no longer available for download,"Originally this book had all the scripts available for download from the author's website. The website is no longer available and the author says the scripts were lost. This is not a big deal for some of the smaller scripts but it is a deal breaker for some of the larger scripts. Since the book doesn't fully explain what the scripts do, it can be disheartening to try and type out a two page script and get error messages back with no explanation.If the scripts were still available this would be a four star review for reference. As it stands now I can't recommended the book."
5,AN UKNOWN GEM,This is one of those hidden gems that comes along rarely. Edo DeWaart is not a house hold name and should be. Not since Toscanini and Reiner has there been a terrific performance of the Pines. Careful detail is expertly realized by Mr. DeWaart. And the forte's are not to be believed. Wow! The San Fransico Orchestra is up to the task. The final movement will knock your socks off. The tympanist has a field day. DeWaart get's it right. I own 20 recordings of the Pines and this is at the top. The Philips sound is surperb. Get this. Play this!
5,An Italian Delight,"In case you missed it, ""Mid-August Lunch"" (Pranzo di Ferragosto) is a delight - a slice of life film that celebrates eating and Italian-ness. You'll smile a lot watching this film and you'll laugh too as you ""help"" Gianni di Gregorio prepare lunch for his mother and an irresistible collection of characters. This is a heart-felt story from the director's own life.The only way to feel more more immersed in the sweet life of Rome is to hop on the next plane to Fiumicino."
5,You will watch it over and over again,"Charming, funny, wonderful movie. A movie that you will watch over and over again, and tell your friends to watch. The middle age son, Gianni, has to spend a weekend entertaining his mother and three ladies and the result is heartwarming. Highly recommend this movie."
3,"Sweet, charming film","A sweet, charming film with marvelous little (in a good way) performances. Feels like you just dropped in for a visit and happened to catch Gianni in the midst of patiently placating his family and neighbors and working out a series of mini-crises."
5,Una referencia total,"Conocí a Michael Franks a través de la radio con este álbum hace ya más de 25 años. Compré una cassette que, con el tiempo, perdí. Un día, milagrosamente, encontré en una tienda de discos este LP, que pude comprar justo con todo el dinero que llevaba en los bolsillos. No me sobró nada y tuve que regresar a casa a pie. Desde ese comienzo, Tiger in the rain, y, por extensión Michael Franks, forman parte de mi vida, de mi esencia como persona. He comprado todos los discos suyos aparecidos hasta ahora, y la edición de uno nuevo es siempre para mí motivo de alegría. Nunca me decepciona. Pero en los momentos claves de mi vida vuelvo al Tiger in the rain, disco que entronca directamente con lo más íntimo de mis sentimientos y con lo más dulce y agradable de mis recuerdos del pasado. Es un disco excepcional, una referencia absoluta en cuanto a CALIDAD, la de una música hecha con gusto, con delicadeza y con un estilo irrepetible."
4,'Tuneful' Ra from the 70's,"Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of space chords throughout this concert, but more than many other live shows from this period this disc features Ra's melodic side during the early 70's which (to me) produced some of his heaviest compositions. Space chants, afro grooves, it's all here in spades. The only thing missing is an extended Gilmore feature, but the band sounds so good, you hardly notice. Lots of Ra solos, though!"
1,Sam George is intolerable!!!,This movie is terrible....If you are a surfer...DO NOT BUY THIS...This is about Sam Georges' personal conquest to surf with a young african boy and thinks that it will somehow fulfill all his hopes and dreams...If the crappy surfing (except Joe Curren which is limited due to Georges' ego I'm sure) isn't enough to keep you away then just imagine listening to Sam George narrating for about 50 minutes or so...they should play the narrative to this in the mountains of Afghanistan to drive out Bin Laden out!!!
2,they just wont let up,"The idea of a film/document about surf culture in coastal African countries is a great one and a necessary one....too bad this particular document was made by ignorant over privileged white people whom couldnt stop saying f***ed up things.......like.......""i tried everything to contact him--from the internet to jungle drums"".....wtf?a new millennium martin and osa johnson safari film."
2,"Sloppily written, badly researched","A quite awful novel, sloppily written and very badly researched. In 1886, a young man has to go from London to Burma, and engage there into a long river voyage to the deep jungle (a la Apocalypse Now) in order to fine tune the piano of a warlord. Anybody who has some familiarity with the Victorian era can see how badly researched this book was, the dialogue sounds instantly phony, people during that era didn't talk (or think) at all like characters of this book do. After reading very favorable reviews, I felt after finishing this novel that I have lost precious hours of my life and whatever money it costs me to buy this book."
4,Sensitive and Elegantly Crafted Historical Fiction,"""The Piano Tuner"" is historical fiction written in the style of Somerset Maughm and E. M. Forster, so carefully and elegantly wrought that the reader is immediately placed in the life, locale and period of the central character, a British piano tuner whose mission is to tune the piano of an eccentric, but seemingly important officer of the British crown, who is stationed in a strategic part of Burma that is not securely controlled by Britain. There are no false or hesitant words by this accomplished and gifted writer, who at 26, has great promise. The only reason that I did not give this novel 5 stars is that the ending is surprisingly abrupt and ill conceived. Overall, a must read, however."
2,Decent...,"There's a noticable lack of polish to the writing in The Piano Tuner that distracts from what is actually a pretty good story. In parts, it reads like something from a college creative writing class, which is disappointing for a published book.Sometimes the author tends toward melodrama, and this is where the writing is weakest. The exotic backdrop of the story was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages, though I wish the dramatic tension had been turned up a notch. Also, I felt the ending was a bit of a letdown. (It almost had the same sort of ambiguity as the frequently anthologized story ""An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" but not quite.)There are definite highlights in both the story and the writing, but it's a mixed bag overall. Mr. Mason is a gifted writer for his age, and he's sure to improve. I'd definitely give a look to his next book, but I was only lukewarm on this one."
3,if i don't think of the word 'pretentious',"I did enjoy this book, though i prefered the second half to the first. The prose are beautiful and it's done with a lot of respect to a very lush culture. I'm half-thai, half-european and was honestly put to shame by the practicing of a language so close to what should be, literally, my mother tongue. The premis was a lil weak, a piano tuner sent to an officer of her majesty's army in a remote area of south-east asia -to tune a piano?! Heh, right, ok. Then again, the King of Siam (now Thailand) offered to send Abraham Lincoln elephants to help his war effort *shrug* so stranger things have happened.I'll look forward to more disease in your next book Daniel. *grin* A nice job for a first work.Oh, and i love the coverart."
2,"Predictable, stereotypical","Lacked originality in depiction of characters and description of the geography/region. A boring, forgettable book."
1,Sophomoric Underachiever,"The sad thing about this book is the obvious poor quality of writing and how opposite it reads to the hype it has received. I am shocked that the blatant errors throughout (a long and tedious read for me) were not corrected by an editor. I am afraid that this book is another in the long line of 'who knows who' books and if this keeps up we will all become illiterate eventually. The author has written something very common and done before, and all the other things that the agents usually reject from writers. I read it to try to find a reason for its big pedigree and found that it is the writer who has that, and a good solid list of family connections. As an English major, and a lover of literature and quality writing, I seriously think he should stick to biology!"
1,Failure,"Great idea ruined by bad writing, weak characters and narrative that doesn't cast a spell over the readers (or at least one of them).It will be up to the others to judge, my impression though is that the author didn't do enough research while working on this book.The language is supposed to be 19th-century British English. The characters, however, seem to be speaking the pompous version of modern American (""Good to see you, Mr. Drake"").The characters are not believable, their presentation lacks observation and those little details that make them come alive.Several story elements (The Man of One Story), while potentially crucial and intriguing, seem to be too sketchy and under-developed.All in all, a disappointment. This could have been one of those epic stories that one wants to read over and over. Thankfully, the author seems to have enough imagination and talent to be able to overcome a lack of skill in his future endeavours."
2,A Disappointing Read,"The title and synopsis promised so much more than was delivered by the text. Essentially, the author's knowledge of Burma and its colonial past is so shallow and his ability to weave personalities into a story-line with credibility is so weak that you become more annoyed with each chapter. The opportunities to insert historical fact are too contrived and out of place. It is a wonder that this book made it through the editorial process of a major publishing house. I give it two stars: one for the author's determination to see his project reach print and the other because it elicited such a reaction from me."
1,This book and all the publicity around it is a SHAM,"I just finished THE PIANO TUNER and honestly, I wish I could have that time back. Oh that I had spent it with a book worthy of reading! I kept plugging away because of all the good publicity around it, but really, this book is a cheap copy of HEART OF DARKNESS with thin cardboard characters, a love story that doesn't work, and a premise ripped off from a famous book that pretty much everyone who would read this book has already read. Don't waste your time with this sham of a novel."
3,Nonsense Ending,"I'd heard good things about this book. Unfortunately, the writing made it annoying to read in places. Things like switching from present tense to the past tense in the same paragraphs. Yes, the setting in Burma was wonderful. But it couldn't make up for the ridiculous ending. It felt like perhaps the author faced a deadline, panicked, and threw something in for the finale. I won't give anything away, but the entire premise of the ending made absolutely no sense."
1,Amazingly Dull,"If you enjoy reading hundreds of pages of dull description of Burma then this is your novel. Honestly, it's just tidbits snipped from general histories jammed into a weakly-plotted novel. Thinly disguised digressions, silly anecdotes (in particular I'm thinking of the sailor). How can the character finally arrive and go on a flower expedition instead of seeing the piano? How ridiculous! A tiger hunt? A tiger hunt? That's satirical, right? They'll send him a piano, but not vaccines?"
4,great book-delivers what it promises except the ending,"I listened to the abridged audio version, which is a pleasure in itself. I really liked the story and the many tales that were told by characters in that story. I was truly taken the time and places described. Somehow, like many works, somehow, the ending seemed quite rushed. I have no idea why authors do this, create a great work but somehow the ending just seems a tired effort.Overall, it was a great pleasure to listen to.--"
3,Dull at Times,"I had a tough time getting into this one. Edgar Drake is a British piano tuner in 1886. He gets an assignment from the military to go to Burma and tune a piano for a British doctor. So he leaves his wife behind and travels to the other side of the world. To make a long story short, he gets mesmerized by the beauty of Burma and its tribal peoples and cultures, he gets Malaria, he becomes infatuated and fascinated with Dr. Carroll's girlfriend, and you start wondering whether or not the piano tuner is ever going to go home to his wife.The piano tuner also has a great appreciation for the music that he hears.You learn a lot about the British efforts to maintain control of its interests in Asia and how explosive things could get. Daniel Mason does a great job of setting the scene and describing the story's surroundings.But for the most part, I found the book to be fairly dry. I give it three stars."
5,Thoroughly engaging.,"I didn't know this was Mason's first novel until I tried to find others he has written. Anyone who understands the discipline and magic of music, who has an appreciation for history and culture, who remembers the sexual tension between a man and a woman, and who has the patience to let this story unfold will find this book seductive and engaging. I found myself idenfying with the characters in this book as I had when I first read The Catcher in the Rye, The Child Buyer and To Kill a Mockingbird, vastly different books from The Piano Tuner and each other, but similar with respect to the exploration of inner motivation, purpose and understanding of self in a world too big and dynamic to ever truly know. Mason's ability to step back and allow dialog and letters tell the story in thier full detail was like eavesdropping on a secret conversation while reading a diary -- a delightful, if guilty, pleasure."
1,A good book for PR...,I'm amazed about all the hype on this book. It was a painful read. His tempo is much too slow. His writing is rough and choppy. I read the back cover and they were talking of his lyrical prose. What lyrical prose? He is no better of a writer than most people out there. And by that I mean non-published authors. Seems to be just hyped up because of his pedigree background.
3,"Mesmorizing, poetic, yet flawed","A piano tuner is summoned from London to go to the jungles in Colonial Burma to tune an Erard grand piano for an enigmatic doctor in the jungles where the mysterious Shan tribes reside. In the slow journey through Europe, the Middle East, India and finally Burma (where the story finally starts), the book is already half way over. There is the requisite arrogant British military officer, enticing, but faceless locals, the beautiful oriental seductress, and the all knowing warlord/poet/doctor, and intrigue in the final pages. The research is good and the author writes well. But the pacing needs some work and the book can't decide whether it wants to be a thriller or a story of a journey."
4,the piano tuner,"I had to sit in my chair after turning the final page and say to myself, ""It's only fiction; it's only fiction."" I care little for the historiocity of the book. I did skip pages of description of journeys in the first half of the book. Nevertheless, the last forty pages of the book made my heart pound and my lungs gasp for breath. An amalgamation of ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Passage to India,"" with a little of ""Henderson, the Rain King"" thrown in. How can anyone not enjoy this book?"
3,Akin to Heart of Darkness,"Mason clearly did a lot of research but his decision to mimic Heart of Darkness had seriously clouded my enjoyment of this book. I HATE passionately Heart of Darkness. While I can follow Mason's story far better than Conrad's, I honestly didn't care enough about the mystery of the owner of the piano to care how the book ended."
2,Badly out of tune,"Daniel Mason has his moments as a writer and and works well with description, but his characters and plot are preposterous. The entire linchpin of ""Piano Tuner"" never rings true, and when the action turns to Burma, it's an exercise in second-rate Maugham with Cliff Notes Conrad thrown in. But the worst is the portrayal of an entire nation as populated by heroic white men and ""inscrutable"" ciphers, capable only of seduction or betrayal. I thought the fashion for novels by ""junior orientalists"" had run its course with Mark Saltzman; sadly, I was mistaken."
5,Well-done...,"My purchase represented an extra copy of the book, ""The Piano Tuner"" for a friend, as I'd already read the novel & have an autographed copy gained when I met the author a few years ago.Timely service and the book arrived in the condition listed."
5,For travelers to Burma. . . a must read.,"This beautiful, evocative book has remained with me long after I returned from Burma/Myanmar. Daniel Mason's first novel is stunning."
3,Beautiful Writing,I agree the story at time was a little slow moving. I enjoyed the writing style and appreciated all the research that went into to this book. I would recommend reading this.
2,Just not very exciting,"It has the exotic historical setting, the intriguing setup, even a map of a country we rarely think about... but the plot just doesn't add up to much. Nor did I learn much about Burma. Oh well."
5,Intriguing,"I find it intriguing that so many people are willing to write free reviews for Amazon. In other words, to do their marketing for them, unpaid. I've worked as a writer and book editor most of my life, and review books frequently - mainly for arts publications. I wouldn't dream of giving my services away, as it degrades the value people place on what is a skilled analysis (and, hopefully, a well-written piece of work). If Amazon want to give credits toward purchase of other products in return for reviews, fine. Otherwise, they can get stuffed. I'm sure there are loads of sad people out there only too happy to give up their time in order to see their opinions and names on a screen. But I'm not one of them."
4,Good tour of India in the 1800's,Daniel Mason's descriptions of the Piano Tuner's travels from London to India were facinating. The complexities of inner country politics of India and the English government were confusing at times. I found this first book to be a very interesting study of first impressions. I probably learned more about the actual turning of a piano than I wanted to know.
1,Waste of time,I wanted to love this book. It was pretty stale and passionless. I hope Mr. Mason's second book is much better.
2,When will I ever learn not to...,"fall for the hype on paperback covers! This book was SO slow and boring, but I kept thinking ""It just has to get better!"" (My sentiments about ""Atonement"" also.) How wrong I was! I never ""connected"" with any of the main characters, and I found all the historical stuff about Burma tedious and confusing. Why the piano tuner felt so impacted by the place just never came through to me. Be sure to read ""The Life of Pi""--now that is a book!"
4,A wonderful journey,"I must say that this is the first book I've ever bought based solely on the reviews. At times, the plot can be a little arduous and slow to develop, but you'd hardly notice because of the beautiful story. Mr. Mason's writing is wonderfully descriptive and seductively transports you back to 19th century Burma."
2,Disappointing historical realism,"Daniel Mason's The Piano Tuner turned out to be a disappointment. Impressive as the it was as a first novel, the lack of editorial skill applied to its pages was overwhelming. A few pages into the novel, two facts are obvious: one, that the writer was American while his subject was the British, and two, that the author inappropriately projected his twentieth century values on a different time and place. Most dialogs were difficult if not impossible to imagine taking place between the English because of language use, sentence structure, diction, etc. Certain scenarios were so American in their construct that transferring it to British Burma (or to British anywhere - even today) was ludicrous. The outcome is unfortunate: stilted and contrived.For those readers who are interested only in plot, you will probably enjoy this book. However, if you are concerned with historical realism or style, you will be disappointed before you hit the second chapter."
1,the piano tuner,"Dear sirs,I am sorry to say that the book, ""The Piano Tuner"", was not one of my favorite books. The only reason that I read it to the end is, because it was chosen for our monthly Book Club. It was not my choice. I love to read and I usually feel all books offer some bit of information. That was the case, because the part of the world and history of it was a bit informative, but not enough to recommend it."
1,"Not beautiful writing, but writing trying to be beautiful","The close of chapter 2 sums up the pretentious emptiness of Mason's prose: ""White. Like a clean piece of paper, like uncarved ivory, all is white when the story begins."" This vapid, wannabe elegance should send readers back to Anthony Trollope or Henry James for lessons in the craft. Add to that the besetting vice of much contemporary fiction, the endless so-what descriptions of nothing in particular (""Mist beads on his glasses and he removes them to wipe them on his waistcoat""-- also at the end of chapter 2). This novel is eye-candy for a culture that has lost touch with literature."
4,"Dense, but worth it","Beautiful writing. This is one multi-talented young man. And humble (in person), too, so what's not to like?Well, the beginning was long-ish, and the end seemed to come on too quickly. The middle was perfect.Interesting way of writing dialogue that I've never seen employed before, all in a single paragraph with only commas separating what one speaker says from another. In Mason's capable hands, it works well.Give it a try, pass it on to a friend, and look forward to his next book - after he graduates from medical school in 2 years!"
1,waste of time,dont even waste your time to see such terrible movie.its dark no dialogue and the actors are people grabed on the streets.
2,Not the Definitive Work,"Followers of the career of Newt Gingrich will be disappointed by this biography. The book is at its best in describing the ins and outs of the local elections Newt fought and won in Georgia, with a lot of background information on each election. But the sections on Newt's Washington career are culled mostly from newspaper articles and interviews with some of the players in the Gingrich era that--surprisingly--add few insights into the nature and character of Gingrich. Steely's prose is often wooden and the numerous changes of tense are jarring. The text in fact at times reads more like a first draft manuscript than a polished biography. Gingrich is clearly the most influential Republican figure of the 1990's and political history demands a sweeping documentation of his career. We'll just have to wait for one."
2,Much left out of Newt's Bio.,"Let us face the facts. Mr. Gingrich is a hypocrite. While talking about how awful President Clinton was, Mr. Gingrich was fooling around behind his wife's back. None of this is included in this book so I am left to wonder what else is missing. A white wash of a book. I give it 2 stars for effort."
3,Too much DX7,"Maybe I'm alone in this, but I hate the sound of the Yamaha DX-7. Unfortunately, Larry Fast apparently got a DX-7 circa 1983, and used it all over this album. So while I would wholeheartedly recommend his timeless earlier work, to my ear this album hasn't aged well at all--it sounds like Miami Vice soundtrack outtakes.Of course, if you like DX sounds and mid-80s flavor synth drums, you might love this album. It's an aesthetic judgement, and your mileage may vary."
2,Elevator Music of the 1980s,"I owned the LP of ""Metropolitan Suite"" back in the mid '80s and thought it was pretty cool. Not having heard it for many years, I bought the recent CD re-issue. After playing it, I realized that New Age music is dated and best-forgotten sonic wallpaper of a musically beige period. Nothing more than drivel for Yuppies who think John Tesh and Kenny G are jazz musicians."
5,Metropolitan Suite is SWEET!,"As a fan of Larry Fast from his ""Sequencer"" album, I was even more delighted to hear this album. His arrangements are expanded beyond the mere emulation of symphony orchestration through the use of analog and digital synthesis, which offers seemingly boundless sonic possibilities. The musical pieces that are covered under the umbrella of ""Metropolitan Suite"" are truly tone poems that paint vivid mental pictures of city life during the early 20th century. The remaining pieces on the album are more upbeat, and yet still produce the excitement of mental imagery through Fast's creative use of electronic instrumentation. Only track eight, ""West Side Nights,"" seems to lack a bit on the production end as it is not as tight as the rest of the album. On the whole a thoroughly enjoyable album that I will play over and over."
4,It IS necessarily so...,"Larry Fast's magnum opus was saved for last--""Metropolitan Suite"". I'm not going to deny its Copland and Gershwin influences, and probably neither would he. For all of its derivative nature, we have a great 5-movement work here--the Gershwin comes in the form of its recurring theme that sounds like something out of ""Porgy and Bess"". Other notable pieces are ""Prairie Light"", which has a Richard Burmer style melodic New Age feel, and ""Redstone"", whose Fender Telecaster guitar timbres not only serve as a nostalgia trip through '60s surf rock, but suggest that Fast may well have written the synth patch on his handmade synths that I take for granted on my Yamaha TX module."
5,Fantastic,"This song, Possession, is one of the very few songs that has NOTHING bad to say about it. This is the most beautiful song I have ever heard and I listen to it every day! My favourite all time song. Definately."
5,A Review of Software Testing Book By Jerry Gao,"I learned many new concepts about Software Testing from this book. I learned how to do the manual testing, automation testing of the component software using this book. White Box Testing, which involves Control Flow Graph is documented well in this book anyone who wants to learn about the White Box Testing can easily learn through it. This book is very user friendly in terms of doing Software Manual Testing.Automation Testing is described well too. I recommend anyone from Software Engineering planning to go into Software Testing should read this book atleast once."
5,A look at the other side of the War,"This is a story of a very brave Erika who survived the worse nightmare and came to tell it all; Erika puts the horror behind her and brightens the world with her sweet smile and a charming face everyday! A book I would recommend to read, so that to get into the other side of the holocaust; not only did the Jews suffered, but the Germans themselves endured a lot of pain from their own leader, Hitler. The author, Erika, has written many books that are educative to kids with sense of humor in them; check out ""Mean Chicks, Cliques, And Dirty Tricks.."" ""Crushes, Flirts, And Friends.."""
1,"Instead, read Walker's ""Prompt & Utter Destruction""","Instead of wasting your time reading this mess, I highly recommend reading J. Samuel Walker's cogent, insightful, and objective ""Prompt & Utter Destruction."""
4,Brief and Touching,"This is a series of very short letters between a Jewish art dealer and his one-time best friend who has emigrated to Germany. It shows the decline of their friendshihp until it is consumed by Nazism. This is a work of fiction that was written in 1932 and recently rediscovered. Now that we know more than they did in 1932, it is a bit anti-climatic; but it shows the heartache of a lost friendship."
5,"Please , don't lose it!","I discovered this book in France and I read the french version.I satayed one week completly disturbed by the book.First I started to read and I couldn't stop until the end.The story is so simple,so emovement, so tragic and it is so well written!I tried to convince a portuguese editor to translate it and to publish a portuguese version.Unfournatelly until now he did not. If you have a chance, please don't lose it, read it!"
5,WHAT? YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS YET?,"Look, who cares how historically accurate this story is, because it is first and foremost that--a story. The letters in the story, however, are based on REAL letters. Basically, it tells the tale of a Jew and a German. The German goes to Germany during the war and the two friends start writing back and forth. I won't spoil the end for you, but the plot twist is wonderful. Considering that this was written in the late 1930's, it reads really well. When this story was published in STORY magazine, that issue sold like fountain drinks in the desert. This is one of the few stories ever written that brings home the nuclear power of words."
4,Address Unknown,"A very compelling book. It is very short and written in the form of letters between two Germans, set during the rise of Hitler. I first bought this book in a hardback edition but recently only the paperback was available. Although this was dearer then the hardback I was very disappointed with the format. The pages were badly cut and not of a standard size. I would not recommend buying the paperback edition. It looks as if it has been assembled by chimps."
5,Impressive Evocation of the Times,"As a teacher of English Composition, I have used this story for decades in my English 102 course. It always provokes stimulating discussions and satisfying writing, especially comparison-contrast between Max and Martin. Yes, some of the details are not historically accurate, and the title is incorrect (it should be Addressee Unknown), but those are not important matters. This is a fine work."
2,O. Henry she ain't.,"Based on the positive hype, I ordered four copies of this lovely little book. I should have read the reviews more carefully, but I did not want to risk finding out the surprise ending. Unfortunately, I can't send this book to anyone on my list: it's a quick read and well crafted, but it's unflattering to Jews (though perhaps it wouldn't have been perceived this way 65 years ago?); and the ultimate message is a great disappointment to anyone who believes that vengeance is not laudable, however cleverly it is accomplished."
4,ATOMICO,"This age documentary collection is a lot interesting, much spectacular one but is not spoken about things that normally are not found in turn. Recommended"
4,An impressive story!,Very educational and easy to read. What a world! I wish the government of North Korea would follow Russia and East Germany and make the choices that would ease the suffering of their people. Makes its point without being preachy.
4,Horrific but true.....,"The Aquariums of Pyongyang was one of the most difficult books I've ever read. Difficult in the way that it describes, first hand, the conditions of daily life in the North, not to mention the gulag.This book should be MANDATORY reading for all Americans, and for that matter for all residents of the western hemisphere who are unaware of the realities of North Korea. The human rights crisis taking place there demands that we all understand what is happening in this part of the world. This book does a great job of furthering that understanding."
5,Very powerful story,"This account provides a chilling & insightful view of the lives of the forgotten political prisoners of the N. Korean gulag system , and how these unfortunate prisoners were systematically viewed and treated as little more than ""tailless animals"". Powerful study of survival. I could not put the book down."
4,Insightful,I have never read a biography about North Korea before. This book was really eye opening and shows the courage of these people have in just living day to day lives.Worth a read.
4,Peek into a nightmarish dystopia,"I thoroughly enjoyed this gripping, personal account of survival and escape from DPRK- a regime whose continued existence is a stain on the worlds conscience. As refugees continue to flee this pitiful land, there are bound to be several more such books in the pipeline. This is one of the first of a niche, and is very readable and nicely written."
5,Stays with you,"This book started slow. The introduction is not the story and the first chapter is just a set-up. When you get into the story, it pulls you in and you are constantly hoping that the protagonist gets out, but also realizing that thousands of people are still in that situation. The book still comes to my thoughts weeks later."
5,Required Reading,"In my opinion this book is on par with Alan Patton's ""Cry the Beloved Country."" It powerfully conveys the plight of foreign oppression with both empathy and clarity.Every US military officer, all federal politicians, diplomats, bureaucrats and personnel stationed in South Korea NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.The author's family willingly emigrated to North Korea. They had been quite wealthy, but felt ideologically drawn to seek North Korean citizenship. Ultimately they were imprisoned.Their experiences as related make it clear that the government of North Korea is by no means a true Marxist state, but has devolved into a cult of personality revolving around the ruling Kim family. No imperial government in history has been more repressive, exploitative or murderous of its people. North Korea's leader is truly evil. Its brainwashed citizens are at once victims and enablers that evil. Their plight is tragic.I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
4,Pretty Good DJ Turntable,"I bought one of these stanton T.60 and I think their a really good kit for listening to music or even scratching music. Had no problems with it, you just need to buy a better cartridge and your set, but overall is good turntable for anybody."
1,Thoroughly unlikable characters,"It is not often that I have such a negative reaction to a book. I love a good story, no matter when it was written...and I don't need a lot of gratuitous sex...but what really frustrated me was how incredibly unlikable her characters were. There was instant antagonism and anger with NO character development. What reason do they have for falling in love short of the fact that they are both good looking. How TRITE is that? If the rest of her books are this bad, then I have no desire to find any more of her work."
5,The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook,"I am so glad that I purchased ""The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook"". After years of wishing to be able to see my abs this book helped me to make it a reality. At 38 yrs old and having had children, I was afraid it would not be a possibility for me. This diet works and is very easy to follow. There is so much enlightening information about nutrition, metabolic slowdown, and how to use free meals, and refeeds, to ensure success on the diet. There is also a wonderful recipe section with delicious meals that fit the diet. I am a very happy customer and highly recommend this book.Mary Ellen"
5,Delivers the goods,"Lyle's title says it all. I lost the weight I wanted, and gained new insight into weight maintenance (having been an Atkins guys for several years now). The caveats I would have are first that the price is high, which I presume reflects small volumes or self-publishing. It was worth every penny for me, though. Second, I suspect you will get best results with the caffeine/ephedrine supplementation suggested."
5,Rapid Fat Loss <3,"I'm a twenty four year old female and I've lost one hundred pounds in the last seven months, half of it thanks to the rapid fat loss diet. I lost thirty pounds the first thirty days of this particular diet, WITHOUT exercise, and I just keep shedding. The weight doesn't just come back as I have taken some low-carb breaks in between. I absolutely love it and I recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind eating only chicken, fish, and egg whites. Not only am I losing weight, I'm learning a lot of discipline from sticking to it due to eating my food very plain since I'm too busy to spend more time preparing it. Furthermore, I find myself having to force feed myself due to lack of appetite. Lyle McDonald is a genius!"
5,Lyle knows,Lyle knows his stuff very very well and he teaches you to! Get this book if you need to lean out really fast and are of higher bodyfat (above 10%) although it is the atkins diet for bodybuilders it produces very very real results!
1,This book is not adequate for AP review,"Besides the many errors in this book, the material does not reflect what is covered on the AP exam. Two examples, the inclusion of Lagrangian mechanics and differential forms of Maxwell's equations. Several multiple choice questions appear in the wrong section."
1,Awful,"This book is horribly counterproductive. The review section isn't worth the paper it's written on, as it doesn't reflect at all the Physics C material. It appears that they just cut-and-pasted the review for the Physics GRE (given to advanced undergraduates), which is absurd. Avoid this book."
5,good resource for adopting families or those who've been adopted,"This book has applications for any Christian in understanding his/her own adoption as God's child. I plan to recommend this book to my friends, especially those that are adopting children into their family or who have been adopted into a family themselves. My favorite aspect of the book is the author's honesty about her own faith struggles in waiting on the Lord throughout the adoption process."
4,the Man Can Spin JAMS!!!,I have always dug GrandMaster Flash He is One of the Baddest Cats on a Turn-Table Ever.He blends so Many Jams together&never misses a Beat.I have most of these Songs already.they all work in this Flow.
1,"If I'd been able to preview it first, I never would've bought it.","This CD is terrible. I love the classic G Master Flash, and was hoping for some good hip hop....thought it would be like mashups, GMF's rap over classic tracks. Nope. I listened to it once, and will never listen to it again. By farm my worst music purchase, and worst amazon purchase. I should've known better, I never buy music w/o a prvw, but I'd heard good things about it. Wish I could return it."
5,Biggest time saver ever!,I've just finished all of my X-Mas shopping in one night and did it all from this book. I herd of stores I didn't know. Thank you from a very busy working mom.
5,"No matter what you call this, it's great music","Is this post-rock? Instru-rock? Ensemble-classical? Who cares what it's called? GYBE make moving, operatic music that is grand in scale and scope, and let's just leave it at that.From the opening moments on the opening track, I knew I was in for ride. The ebb and flow are amazing. GYBE slowly lift you up to an anthemic summit rife with soaring guitars and strings, and then they bring you back down to the depths with throbbing bass lines and trecherous, pounding guitar.This album would be worth the price of admission based on the first song alone, but GYBE grace us with four more majestic pieces that twist emotions with cinematic flourishes. Any band (perhaps they prefer the term ""collective"") that can manipulate your thought processes so effortlessly must be doing something right. I'm not sure exactly how they do what they do to me, but I'm always more than happy to go along for the ride."
4,Beauty,"This is Godspeed and their predictable best. So amazing, so powerful. In my humble opinion, they don't need to waste all the time they waste getting to the climaxes which are the only reason I listen, and I'm sure everyone agrees. But they are to inept to go from climax to climax with out crescendos, and some of the crescendos are pretty amazing anyway, so good job GYBE!"
3,"Quality, but spread too thin...","While I was hoping for another great effort from GYBE!, this just isn't it. The material is spread too thin, and the work is, in general, inconsistent. After picking up f#a# infinity symbol a while back, I was looking forward to hearing some new material from the band. Sure, the album is good, maybe even very good, but it's not the masterpiece for those looking for something to praise as the album of the year. Comparisons to Radiohead are poorly founded... the bands don't sound anything alike, and gladly so. Both bands are making unique, quality music. That said, this album could have used a bit more work, and some consolidating. If you're looking for something to praise as the album of the year, and aren't interested in the Kid A bandwagon, which still tops my list, try Sigur Ros' new work, Agaetis Byrjun... Sigur Ros' music, while occasionally similar to GBYE!, is more beautiful, and at times, more lonely."
4,Sprawling and dramatic,"""Lift yr. skinny fists like antennas to heaven!"" is a truly remarkable record. Radio airplay couldn't be further from this band's mind given that the tracks are well over 20 minutes each. Musically, the only artists that remotely resemble GYBE are Sonic Youth and Philip Glass (who do not remotely resemble each other). Imagine the melodic and harmonic beauty of Glass' operas (sans vocals) coupled with the great droning, clanging electric guitars of ""Daydream Nation."" Wonderful, engrossing listening. And no, it's not pretensious (unless you think anything but verse-chorus-verse-4-minutes-later-and-I-hope-it-was-good-for-you is pretensious). BwO"
3,Really Average,"Let me start out by saying that I am a fan of many different genres of music, and after hearing so many great things about this band thought, I'd give them a try.I knew from the get go it was going to be long and repetitious, I have no problem with that (I'm a huge Philip Glass fan).The bottom line here is that the music is simply not that interesting. It has none of the seminal qualities of minmalism and none of the hooks of popular music. It's not that it's unpleasant to listen to, it's just not the sort of thing that will make you want to hear more.In a word, bland."
2,Oh come on...,I bought their CD and saw them live. Everything about them is boring. Take a lesson from Mogwai or Windy and Carl.
2,Very let down,"I good comments about this CD, then I bought it. Ouch. This music is so long and drawn out that it gave me gas."
2,pop trash,"if you want a cd with a bunch of meaningless bubblegum lyrics set to dull generic techno beats and radio friendly hooks, then this is the album for you! the lead singer is nothing more than another britney spears clone, and i was not impressed with the guest appearances by 98 degrees and leean rimes. if you want to hear some real music, i suggest you run (not walk) to the record store and pick up creed's human clay."
5,nowhere to fall from,"The music is symphonic, although only a few members of the orchestra showed up today... The theme is solemn perhaps even tragic but so is our present state of earthly affairs, so we find ourselves quite comfortably on this ground. The lyrics come to us straight from the soldiers of their battle fronts. Their voices might not be the purest but... their thoughts and feelings seem to be. The overall atmosphere this music spreads upon us, although quite somber, brings us comfort of levels with nowhere to fall from. We are walking the walk with Godspeed You Black Emperor and more we do more we want to stay there in this... strange place. It seems hard to believe the place did not exist before this great Canadian band created it."
4,Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven,"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven being GYBE's second studio album and 2000 release reminds me of many experimental bans that I have heard before,i.e., Laibach, Yes, Kraftwerk, Einsturzende Neubauten, Pink Floyd and Grateful Dead. The use of samples also reminds me of Skinny Puppy. The booklet is very strange. With basically no information inside and a strange letter written by the band. Allmusic (4/5) and Pitchfork Media (9/10) both gave it high marks and I agree with this assessment. The album is not easy listening and is very challenging but also extremely rewarding and definitely cutting edge without sounding pretentious. 4/5."
5,Darkness and air,If Stars of the lid represent light and water then Godspeed represent Darkness and air.This is music that can be intense and almost claustrophobic and then majestic and uplifting.Imagine the sort of music they would play in a Tibetan shopping mall in the year 2042.
4,Okaaaaaaay...,"Alright, I got this CD on impulse because it thad an intriguing title. The music was decent; long classicalish pieces interspersed with bizzare snippets of randomness - I d give it three stars; it was a bit slow in some places, and I didn't notice too much that was truly spectacular. I'll give them another half-star for the two pictures on the CD container; which were truly insane: One seemed to be a masked Ben Franklin snipping off some guy's hands with some scissors. The other had the masked Ben Franklin and a masked, 3-armed George Washington trying to make some slacker wear a suit as the no-handed guy protrudes from a cloud with an odd expression on his face. That makes 3.5, and they can have another half-star for giving the impression that there's some deep political statement embedded in the album that as of yet I have failed to grasp. Pick it up if you need to replenish your supply of randomness."
3,Its good but stop listening to it!,"I've had this album for a year now and can honestly say the only track i still listen to is the one about coney island. This is a very good introduction to ambient music depending on how much you like the calm and minimal sections of the songs. If you do you should stop listening to the GYBE and pick up the Lustmord/Rich Compilation, ""Stalker"", or and Lustmord for that matter. A little Bill Laswell wouldnt hurt either."
4,...so...,Shut up and just listen. It might not be the best but what the Hell is 'the best' these days?! It's certainly much more beautiful and adventurous than a lot of junk out there. You're allowed to enjoy music just for the sake of it. You're allowed to detach yourself from the world and float in magical melodies. So why the Hell not just do it without all the 'ifs and buts'. I think the key to truly enjoying music like this is to just succumb to it.

3,"Looks good, but Seller has been slow",I have other Coolaroo market umbrellas which I enjoy. Since it's not canvass it dries easily and is less prone to mold. This one arrived damaged though. I notified the Seller two days ago - I have yet to receive a response. My only negative comment is about the customer service so far - not about the product itself.
2,10 Years on...,"Previous experience: I've got a decent enough working knowledge of HTTP, I've had a good read of RFC2616, etcI bought the book looking to fill gaps in knowledge. Others have reviewed the book relatively recently and said the protocol hasn't changed. This is certainly true, but a number of the sections have aged very badly, or cover topics less important in the modern world of high bandwidth links. (Proxy servers, for example, are now a lot less about bandwidth and a lot more about virus scanning and content filtering)The is also a fair amount of coverage of HTTP/1.0 and 0.9, rarely seen these days.That said, the base concepts are still valid and there are things I've learned. So its a bit of a mixed bag really."
4,A journey into the HTTP world,"Definitely a very good book, useful for both learning topics and use as a reference after the first read. It will bring you into a 360 degree view of the HTTP protocol and everything that is strictly related with it. It's well written, easy to be read and full of images and samples. I was a bit concerned as was written back into 2002, but is still very actual.Recommended to anyone who wants to know ""a bit more"" about HTTP, it will bring you to the next level."
5,Magnifica Narracion y Dramatización / Magnificent Novel,"El Conde de Montecristo es una novela de Alejandro Dumas que maneja amor, pasión y venganza en una forma magistral.Estoy seguro que le conmoverá y lo hara reir y llorar. No debe dejar de leerla/escucharla. Esta presentación trae 3 CDs en una versión abreviada que es estupenda con una calidad de sonido excelente.La novela es apta para jóvenes, además es una buena forma de practicar español.The Count of Monte Cristo is a superb novel by Alexander Dumas. Its main team is love and revenge done in a masterly novel.I am sure it will make you laugh and cry. Don't doubt it, it is amazing. This one has 3 Cds in abridged presentation with a magnificent sound quality.This is also a nice novel for young people and it is good for spanish practice.Enjoy it big."
5,Impecable........,"The story itself by Dumas is passionate and inspiring.the best book I''ve ever read, has been Montecristo. you feel like you are Edmond himself.......by how this tale takes you to surrender your good soul into what I call the great vengeance.at the end you can judge what god has to say as a lesson of our own lives."
3,Electric Knife Works Better,"I tried this and the ""Deluxe Corn Cutter - Stainless Steel"". This one worked better, because the blade bent on the other one after 15 minutes of use. I wasn't very impressed though, because this tool didn't remove all of the corn in one pass. It worked best on ears with very thick cobs, but in many cases I had to make 3 or 4 passes. After a few dozon ears it gets tiring to use, since you are using force to push down. A better investment would be and electric knife."
1,DO NOT BUY,Broke the first time it was used. Sodder came off one side. Flimsy and poorly made for the use it was designed.
2,Love This Corn Cutter but. . .,"I'm now on my third corn cutter. I LOVE how it easily and smoothly cuts off all the kernels of corn with the gentle rocking motion described by another reviewer. You have to get the knack of using it to fully appreciate it. You also have to cut off the bottom of the ear of corn so it sits flat on the work surface or the corn can easily slip on the work surface while using the cutter making the cut kernels fly everywhere. However, it still eventually breaks at the rivets, thus, the low rating. I've tried different brands of this type of cutter and they all break at the rivets, some lasting longer than others. When (not if) this one breaks I'm going to try the Pampered Chef corn cutter. Although not as efficient, it has great reviews and no reports of breaking or injuring the user."
1,mmmm,"It only works with thick corn, this ist'n as seen on youtube, at least using manually, may be with a drill most be better."
1,DO your homework before you buy this,Does not work well with Windows XP. Do your homework and check review sites before you buy this.
3,Can't get pictures to comuter,"The camera seems alright, but everytime I try to transfer pictures from the camera to the computer, XP crashes. It works on other people's computers, but that does me no good."
3,Don't go into this looking for Blade or Rising Sun,"This is not a fast paced movie. It does have an interesting story of a cop tracking down the murderer of his partner. Well paced and good performances by Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Viggo Mortenesen, Seymour Cassel, and the rest the cast. The settings are good and the music is decent. I hadn't seen this in years but I bought it thinking it was a murder mystery. I wasn't quite right but it was certainly worth seeing."
3,"Movie is not really what you expect from Mr. Snipes, but...",..... does anybody know something about the Music in this Movie?? The BigBand sounds are incredible but I've now idea where to get a soundtrack ( nothing seems available )or at least who's performing the music !!??
2,Slow moving!!,"This film is much like a 1940's film noir. This is not one of Wesley Snipes best. I found the dialogue to be unbelievable. The story is slow moving, which does the film no favors. It winds up to be a disappointing venture for Snipes & Dennis Hopper, who was wasted in his role."
1,"[Poor] ""action-drama"" with horrid acting...","This long-forgotten chapter for respectable actors Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, and Viggo Mortensen is surprisingly very predictable with little to no action and very bad acting, even on the leads' parts. The plot concerns a heist and a cop out for revenge. The movie tries to advertise the fact that Snipes' character gets real ticked off, but it's more like slightly annoyed or frustrated. Not much of a ""Boiling Point"" here, just a little chip on the shoulder. Hopper, better in everything else, even ""Waterworld"", is completely unconvincing as the bumbling villain and Snipes, usually awesome, is reduced to saying cliche lines in a plot that's so boring it's a wonder it's based on a true story. Don't see this one at all. It's [not good], there's little action, and it lessens the respect of everyone involved."
2,"Boiling Point lukewarm, at best","'Boiling Point' has the right ingredients. Its dueling leads Wesley Snipes and Dennis Hopper both have reputations for cinematic intensity. And Lolita Davidovitch is sultry enough as Snipes's shady-lady love interest. But for some reason, the ingredients don't blend well enough to 'boil', and Boiling Point instead barely rises to tepid entertainment. Perhaps it is because Boiling Point really lacks enough overall script development to elevate it to big screen status. For one thing, it takes too long for Snipes to catch the villians, thus hampering the pace with needless sting operations, backroom deals, informants, and the like. Secondly, as the heavy Dennis Hopper isn't nearly as ruthless as his thug partner Viggo Mortensen. In fact, Hopper comes off as misguided at worst! Nevertheless, the L.A. scenery is a plus, as is the costuming. Both manage to keep Boiling Point watchable. But when it all boils down, Boiling Point is lukewarm, at best."
1,Even with Snipes and Hopper Boiling Point is a flop!,Even Wesley Snipes and Dennis Hopper can't save a movie with a weak script and storyline. Boiling Point offers viewers the worst performances of these two fine actors careers. This movies absolutely stinks. And thats putting it mildly. I give this movie one star only because zero stars wasn't given as an option.
3,Does not apply to U.S.,"This book was published in Great Britain and deals with British standards and laws. While it is interesting to compare with US standards, and some things are essentially the same in both countries, it is not a good LARE review book !"
5,this is simple-,Do yourself a favor. Make this essential purchase. Without a doubt the best CD of 2002. You'll be nostalgic about this one in ten years.
2,the good the bad and the what the heck was he thinking,"i really enjoyed the upbeat ""Destroy She Said"" single, but that new version of ""Sunglasses at Night"" is terrible. the singer mucks up the words, misses the bridge completely, and then sings the chorus over a repeat of the verse music, avoiding the chords and melody of the original. he must have been really high when he recorded that, and it's obvious that he doesn't know his way around a studio. when you don't even respect the material enough to reference the original music and words, it's a sign you're full of baloney."
3,An enjoyable CD that covers part of the scene,"This is Tech Pop 21st Century Electro & New Wave is both a mouth full and a cd full of synthpop bands that are giving the US music press something to write about. Its got the names and music you should hear if you are new to electro/synthpop (Fischerspooner, Miss Kitten & Ladytron) and lots of new bands, but it lacks the big hits from other bands in the scene such as Spray (""I am Gothic""), Ganymede (""Neon Rain""), Fr/action (""Inner Being""), Nukleon (""Lucky""), Iris (""Lose in Wanting""), Mesh and Simulator. My criticism is that Tech Pop 21st Century is a little bit heavy on the ""art"" and less balanced with good pop tunes.I recommend this cd if you want to see what everyone is talking about when they say Electroclash. Its quirky, interesting and good music for the moment. However, if your taste is art AND catchy tunes, I recommend another compilation such as Electricity or Evolution."
5,A Worth To Hear Album,"This single is also a good single. It has only six songs , three songs and three instruments , but the songs and instruments are nice.Especially the song breaking out of the morning.Buy it , it's a thums up single!"
4,hydration station,it does what it says it does. only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week.
3,"It is what it is, a sponge in a plastic holder","As the title of my review says the Planet Waves Acoustice Guitar Humidifier is what it is, a sponge in a plastic container. I have made one similr with a sponge and a travel soap bar box.I prefer the humidifier packs that yo ucan get as they seem to have provided my Taylor GS Mini with much better tone over time. The humidifier packs can go both ways, sucking in humidity if the air is too wet and releasing moisture if the air is too dry, which is great for the climate I live in.Not sure I would recommend spending money on this but if you want to buy it is delivers as described. Also not sure I would recommend this for folks who are serious about tone and maintiaing the proper humidity in their guitars/ukes/etc."
3,"does the job, but could be better","My guitar has stayed humified and that is the goal. However, I was hoping this would have been a little easier to maintain. The cap is a bit awkward to remove and, in the past, I've had humidifiers that I could 'inject' water into using a needleless syringe. I was also hoping for a longer lasting sponge so I wouldn't need to refill so often. Anyhow, it does the trick."
3,I don't understand this ...,I just got my first acoustic guitar and the guy at the store sold me one of these. I guess it would be good....if I could figure out where to put it. I thought he said it goes between the strings but when I do that it stretches the strings that hold it to be wide apart and it just doesn't look right. I might rate it higher if it had come with any instructions for those of us who have never used one before.
2,Dries out too fast,"This guitar humidifier dries out fast and you'll need to fill it up about every 2-3 days, spend the extra money and get the Oasis. I live in a moderately dry climate and this humidifier requires more attention and time than I want to spend worrying about my precious guitars.Planet Waves Acoustic Guitar Humidifier"
1,"Easy to use, but doesn't work","I live in the mountains in colorado, so you should take into account the dry climate. Having said that, this product doesn't work. I was told it is incredibly easy to use. This is true. The underlying problem is that it doesn't give off much humidity. I re-fill every night, and my guitar began to crack. The same thing happened to my friend with the same product. I took my guitar to a pro repair show, and the man said he has fixed countless guitars using this humidifier. He kindly pointed me to a functioning one."
4,Decent Humidifier.,"This thing works fine, as long as you are a patient person. It takes some time to fill the sponge with water from the syringe a few drops at a time. Also the fact that it is in between the strings makes the strings go out of tune a bit because its bending them. The sponge also becomes discolored. The good thing is that the humidity will reach the neck since it is not enclosed in the body like other humidifiers. All in all its not too bad."
1,New ones worse,The old ones were better. I have two and they work fine. The new one I bought is cheaply made. It doesn't hold as much water and dries out quickly. Planet Waves should go back to the old model. -Alastair L-C
3,Better than nothing,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
4,Voodoo in New Orleans?,"Folk tales of a famous witch or voodoo queen in Louisiana. She was from Haiti, so there is conflict with the Christian environment.1956, 96pp, with a bibiliography in back and several page on how to read palms. Hard to find."
4,Minnetonka Moosehide Boat Moccasin,"These moccasins are well made of high-quality materials. Construction is excellent, and the shoes are extremely comfortable. The only negative is that the sizing seems to be slightly off. I ordered size 12 and they seem to be about 1/2 size smaller."
4,Great writing tool!,Very helpful for teaching young kids how to compose well written paragraphs and reports. Recommended!
3,Good book but swarm with typos,"I am totally amazed from what a great technology JSF is. I have worked for so many years with Struts - JSF beats it definitely. And this book is quite good at teaching it. I would give it 5 stars for the content if there were no typos. There are swarms of them. I am currently on page 212 and I see them at least every 3 pages. What's bad about these typos is that they are all in important areas - not just misspelt words but messed up names of classes and objects. I am getting tired from them.But again, the content of the book is great."
1,hate the excerpt that show incomplete example,this book is close to useless with code excerpt that show incomplete example. you cant learn anything this way.for example describing data model event. he included the excerpt that create datatable and datamodel. added datamodellistener and blabla. anyone with java event programming knows the drill. but this code is done in context what? where is the *.jsp page and corresponding html component?he mentione faces-config.xml? but where to place this file in your web application? in web.xml? where?these r-e-t-a-r-d authors need their head checked. so they can write a decent book. throw away or burn this book. just learn JSF online by yourself...also seriously lacking back-bean example. this is ridiculous
3,A potentially good book let down by poor editing,"I agree with some of the reviewers that this book has too many typo errors. Some of the errors are so obvious that they make me wonder whether the book has been proof read before it goes into printing. There are also obvious discrepancies between the code listing and the accompanying explanation. For example, in a few examples, the code listed one thing and the accompanying text just after it refers to something that is not found in the code listing or contradicts the code listing.The upside about these typos errors is it kept me alert when I come across something that doesn't make sense. It also helped me in my understanding of JSF as I identify and correct the errors.Nevertheless, it could have been a much better book if it has been professionally proof read and edited."
2,Poor code examples,"This book does not compare to ""Core Java Server Faces"" first edition by Geary and Horstman. The book provides fery few and not very useful code examples. The content is not very organized. Also, it does not address more advanced topics such as displaying very large result sets."
5,Only book you need on JSF,"This book is great if you read all of it. It has a project similar to what you might encounter in the ""real world"". It gently leads you through the project development.You should not use this book as a ""quick and dirty"" way to get up to speed on JSF. If you try, you'll miss a lot of the fundamentals of JSF which could hold you back fromcustomizing your own pieces of JSF components. JSF was meant to be pluggable and highly customizable.The book offers an additional 4 chapters online which is a nice bonus. The additional chapters are not needed to fully understand JSF but could save you time if you needed tocode something similar to the chapter's example projects.With JSF In Action, I found everything I would need to program in JSF. I do not feel any need to go out and buy another book on JSF."
4,A good read,"A good read. Congrats to the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press for bringing this one out. It would also be great to one day see Ukrainian authors like Yevhen PAshkovsky and Ihor Klekh in english translation for our American readership. Later dudes, Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, June 1999"
3,Just for Heath,"Four Feathers has had many incarnations in literature and film. Despite a first rate cast and some lush cinematography I found some glaring problems that really disputed the film for me. On the eve of being shipped out to war int he Sudan Heath(very good) resigns his commission in the army and his friends and fiancee send him 4 white feathers which is the sign of cowardice and they abandon him. Heath resigns because he is scared, but then all of a sudden he goes off to the Sudan on his own not to rejoin the army, but to save his friends which I guess he knew would need saving. The battle and retreat will throw off anyone familiar with military tactics and reason. I also disliked the ending with Kate Hudson, but I won't spoil it for those who have not seen the film."
1,more than disappointed,"I purchased this product to hold my collection of sculptures in place on display shelf. Most of the sculptures were ceramic or stone. One piece is about 1100 years old, it was a gift to me. I was horrified to find that the putty leached something into the sculpture and has discolored it. On another piece, it actually removed some of the fired clay. It has damaged my sculptures and doesn't work any better than the common old sticky tack that I purchased to hang flyers. No I would not recommend to anyone, sticky tack is cheaper and works better. Heart broken over damage to sculptures."
2,Disappointing,"Not very sticky and not effective for small pieces of china/glass at all. I had to put a whole handful almost of it on the bottom of my Royal Albert teapot to get it to hold. Also, not sure that after awhile that it will just dehydrate and give way. There has got to be something better than this!"
4,Vinyl is better,Nice collection. I have vinyl's of Jo Stafford as well. No doubt that digital recordings are of lesser tone quality.
1,Bad CD,The CD I received has spaces with no music in the middle of a song (breaks in music). What are my options?
2,Just Okay,"I was a disappointed with this movie. I purchased it for my 5 year old grandaughter and it didn't even keep her attention. IMHO, it was too hokey for a Disney film. Definitely not worth the money.Snow Buddies"
3,"""Iron Will - Lite""","This movie is what I call ""Iron Will - Lite."" But my kids are absolutely crazy about these ""Buddies"" movies. I speculate that this series is hugely successful, as a film franchise."
2,good,disk did skip some had to clean it good and was missing the disney points but my kids loved the movie so that is what counts to me
5,Snow Buddies,"This is a great movies for children. I watched it with my 5 and 7 year old grandchildren. The movie has several wonderful messages: cooperate by sticking together with family and friends through thick and thin, help the ones who need help, (even if they are the competitors) pay attention to wise advise, try hard to do your best and always remember that parents are usually on your side. Awesome. Great for a Sunday afternoon with grandkids and popcorn.Maria Russell"
5,Simply wonderful!,Great movie for young and old alike. The computer animation is really good and the pups are soooooo cute. We will definitely watch this again and again.
1,cruelty to puppies for fun,"I wont see this movie is against my love for good family movies. 30,8weeks golden retriever puppies,the Snow Buddies set in Vancouver, British Columbia on Feb. 19, 2007 . 6 weeks old when they were separated from their mothers and brought by the trainer. American Humane has recommended that Snow Buddies only import puppies that are older than 14 weeks. All vaccinations have to be done by a veterinarian, along with thorough check-ups. American Humane was unaware that the puppies were underage when they were transported by the trainer from the breeders. American Humane report this.The American Humane Association is the only national organization dedicated to protecting both children and animals"
1,If You Buy This DVD You Are Supporting Killing Animals to Make Movies,"The puppies used to make Snow Buddies were taken from their mother too early, illegally imported from the US to Canada, and caught parvo. Many puppies died or were removed from the set before replacement puppies were brought in. They also became sick.Please do not support Disney for allowing animals to die in order to make their movie. Tell your children why you believe it is wrong to buy a product that caused innocent deaths!Please do NOT BUY Snow Buddies."
1,Animal Cruelty!!!!,"I will NOT buy this cruel, incompetant, and mismade film and I encourage you and your friends do the same.Google the following for a report by the American Humane Socielty:American Humane Association Statement on Snow BuddiesThanks to reviewer ""For Entertainment Purposes Only"" for setting me straight. Please see his review for additional info."
5,Great movie,Great movie for kids. Hope they keep making more. The grandsons loved it. Made a great gift. Didn't worry about them watching it.
5,Great Film for Folks of All Ages,This is a great film for all ages. Parents and grandparents can enjoy with children as it shows positive values.
4,Great movie for kids,"My children (2 and 5) LOVE this movie. I agree with another reviewer: if I could split my review adult/child, I would give it 3 for adults and 5 for kids. It is difficult to find a movie both children like with just the right amount of ""suspense"" and this one hits the mark perfectly. The children stay interested in the story line without ever being concerned (no hands over eyes during the film!). We are excited to now check out Air Buddies. Glad to have another family movie to watch."
4,Adorable Puppies and Beautiful Scenery,SNOW BUDDIES is a fun film for kids and adults. The story is simple and predictable--a group of 5 Golden Retriever puppies accidentally end up in Alaska and become part of a dog race. The joy in this film is watching the adorable puppies and the gorgeous Alaskan scenery. I wish the film had been in the theaters to enhance the beautiful visuals. I see a few reviews are commenting on possible animal cruelty but I feel strongly that Disney would take all precautions for the puppies' safety and well-being during the film. I love animals and this delightful film brought a smile to my face.
5,Great family movie!,"This is a great movie for the entire family. After renting this movie I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy. We have a puppy with the same markings & color as Shasta, except she is an Alaska husky mix with brown eyes."
4,Children Captivated,My six-year old grandson and his friends were captivated by the story and the sensitive way it was developed. We highly recommend this lovely DVD.
2,Very Poor,"This is terrible. As previously noted, the book will fall to pieces within a month, so it doesn't even matter much if your copy is one of many which were printed with the spine on the left, as at least one batch has been. The vocabulary in the text is sometimes repeated at the chapter summaries, sometimes absent. The book contains a Hebrew-English glossary that contains about 70% of the vocabulary used, and there is no English-Hebrew glossary. Grammer rules are explained poorly, and there are virtually no redeeming characteristics that warrent a ""real"" edition. This textbook is wracked with typographical and conceptual errors, and the ""pilot"" edition should be a testament to its failure."
4,beataholic matures,"Some tracks are more stunning then others, though they all hold their own - a solid album... Especially worth it for tracks 1+2. Black Thought + Krush might as well just do a whole album together while they're in the same studio. Then you'd see magic.(Roots fans, this is one of Black Thought's tightest tracks thanks to Krush's production)Side note: Kakusei is his most innovative album to date, I have yet to hear anything like it. Nobody's even had the insight to bite it yet. If you haven't heard it you should."
3,Decent Sound Not Great Quality,"After about a year the player starting skipping DVD's. Another month or so and it started freezing DVD's. I had to hook my old player up and just use the this as a sound option. The sound is OK, dialogue is much quieter than effects. Would recommend spending extra $50-$100 to get better system."
3,DVD player,"I love the quality of sound and clarity. The problem I had is the DVD player crashed only 6 months after purchase. I've read that many people have had the same problem, how about a recall? All the equipment I have is Samsung, TVs DVDs. DVDR roms, no problem with anthing else."
1,DVD went bad and the service on this is worse,Works ok with some DVDs. The only reason I bought was for the radio included in but it was not worth the trouble. In 12 months it has spent atleast 2 months getting fixed. The DVD doesnt open and they dont know whats the fix for it. Said they added some lubricant to open but it failed again. Then they changed the laser head dont know why but even that doesnt seem to help
3,Like everything but the voice,"Everything seems ok about this, but I cant hear the voice channel very well. I pretty much have to turn it up to 35-40 to be able to hear much voice durring a movie... If I could fix that I'd be plenty happy."
1,DVD part went bust after just 11 months.,"Bought it Nov. 2003, broke 9/30/04 and the warranty covers labor for only 90 days. It never worked that well to begin with, some DVD wouldn't work on it, although they worked fine on other players."
2,Okay while it worked,"I got this television as a birthday gift. The picture seemed to be pretty good when I got it home and hooked it up. Keep in mind I was going up from a 27' tube TV lol. I had this TV for less then 24 hours and suddenly it wouldn't turn on anymore. Had no clue what the problem was. tried calling their customer support number and could never get through to anyone. Sat on hold forever then just gave up and took it back. Ended up spending a few extra hundred dollars and upgrading to a 32' Samsung, and I'm not disappointed.When it worked it was a decent picture, but the service was horrible and their website was pretty bogus too."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!,"It worked for less than three hours then the screen froze. I powered it off then back on it worked for another 15 minutes then the screen froze again. Now when powered on it freezes on one of two screens an all blue screen or the ""Olevia"" logo screen. This is just in less than three hurs of initial use."
4,Happy with it,"I purchased SD-3950 from Amazon.com about 5 months ago and I used it with a new Sony HD TV set. It was very easy to setup and operate. So far no problem at all. It can read minor damaged DVDs that my other DVD player can't read. The picture quality is good but I have no chance to compare with other progressive scan DVD player yet. The olny thing I don't like is when you use fast forward, it doesn't show you a smooth fast forward, but it jumps forward. Overall, it is a cheap DVD player (I paid for under $40 after rebate) with pretty good quality for me."
1,45 Minutes and it doesn't work!,"I just picked this up from Future shop (Van, BC). Anyways, took it home. I was impressed in regards to the features, and the menu. I popped in Matrix Reloaded, and 45 mins through, the machine stopped playing. I couldn't get it to respond, nothing nadda. So I opened the dvd bay and popped in another disc, wouldn't even recognize it.Went and found a review someone mentioned having to turn it off for 5 minutes to get it to work again, what a load! I tried that, and then put in another dvd, got 13 seconds in and it stopped again.Won't read CD's, DVD's anymore, just stopped. And I just bought the thing two hours ago new!All I can say is that, if you're lucky, you'll get a good working product, but we shouldn't have to be 'lucky' just to get a WORKING product!I am pretty irritated, and will take it back tommorow."
2,Beware!,"I bought this unit for the mp3 and jpeg capability. I have a 2 year old Pioneer that played all my home made dvd's and vcd's but didn't have the mp3 or jpeg features. To my dismay this unit will not play my vcd's. The owner's manual says it plays vcd's but it won't. I haven't tried mp3 cd's yet and some photos on a disc were skipped over, I'm not sure why. Dvd's played well- picture and sound were fine. Home made Dvd's were fine too. If you are not interested in vcd then add another star."
1,You may want to avoid Toshiba DVD players ENTIRELY,"I originally purchased a Toshiba SD-1200 back in 2000. It had excellent playback and audio, but it finally died in 2003. It still plays cds, but it is unable to read DVDs. I chalked this up to 3 years of heavy use. Satisfied with the performance of the first Toshiba, I bought an SD-3900 to replace it. Now, a little after a year(and out of warranty), the second Toshiba is struggling in the same manner to start DVDs and access certain menu items. I have also experienced ""trapped"" DVDs that lock out the controls and force me to unplug the player. Some cds malfunction on the player as well. The cd begins to play, the index numbers start to jumble, and the sound stops. Very strange. I have kept the player more or less dust free and regularly used a lens cleaner, so it has been reasonably maintained. I am just going to avoid Toshiba DVD players from now on."
1,Toshiba DVD Players- DO NOT BUY,"I have had 3 Toshiba players,including this one and 2 were DOA and after replacement from Toshiba, none have lasted for 2 years. Even at this price it isn't worth having a player that works one day and is garbage the next day."
2,DO NOT BUY! Terrible,"I have had this player for a little over a year. I thought it was a great buy due to some good reviews and that it played many different ""types"" of movies. Well, low and behold, what I paid for is what I received. It pauses on many of my movies and shuts down. Right now, its not playing ANY of my movies. Not a good sign. I'm going to complain to amazon and the company who sold it through them. Buyer beware"
4,"Good player, but misleading technical data","I agree this is a good player for the price. Setup is quick and easy. My biggest complaint is that it lacks a digital optical output even though the technical description lists it as available. I contacted Amazon about this error in 11/03, and still no correction has been made to the description."
2,Could be Great!?,"The Toshiba SD3950 has all the add-ons a basic DVD player owner could want. A very nice remote control, Auto-play for both DVD's and audio cd's (also autoplays Mp3's), very easy set-up...just plug in and let'er rip. That is where the niceties end.The Toshiba SD3950 has terrible audio, primarily on Mp3 and CD playback. The sound is distorted, it's as though the outputs are overdriven. Audio on DVD's is not all that great either. You can set up the audio to hear dialogue using the audio settings, but you sacrifice overall audio quality, this because the player raises mid-range and nearly ignores other frequencies. Thus overall audio quality is sacrificed so you can hear dialogue you may not be able to hear otherwise.Bottom line: NICE features, NICE Remote, VERY,VERY POOR audio!!!"
1,Would not turn on after 1 day,I purchased this DVD player at Best Buy and was thoroughly impressed with the quality. Loved the remote control. The next day I went to watch another movie and the player would not even turn on. No power at all. I had only watched ONE movie on it before it broke. I took it back to Best Buy and they refunded my money and tried to get me to upgrade to the SD-3960 for $10 more!! Needless to say I was disappointed.
4,Loved it !,It was in perfect condition and I now have it sitting on a stand on my mantel. It complements my collection of tea cups.
4,built to spill,"Fawkin a' this is a good band...""If you want to rock out and cry, this is your chance."" Can you do both?...""Yes, crying comes natural and easy when you listen to this band...I'm listening to it right now, and I can barely see any more, my eyes are all puffy and red.""Pick up any recording of this band!"
3,Good but not Overwhelming,"This album is a lukewarm remix at best, with all the interest in Chomsky's point of view post 9-11 the concepts and ideas presented here have become repetitious.If you own "" American Addiction"" and ""New War an Terror"" you really have covered everything discussed here.I can't totally dismiss ""Emerging Framework"" though; the always-brilliant Chomsky Q&A at the end of the disc is well worth the price of admission."
3,Not Aquarium Safe!!,"This may be a fine product, but I am responding to the earlier comment that it is aquarium safe. No sealants that have anti-mildew agents are aquarium safe. These agents kill important bacteria necessary to the health of fresh and saltwater aquariums. NOT FOR USE WITH AQUARIUMS!!"
5,Amazing!,"I must say, this stuff is amazing. It dries very quickly and has a very nice feel and look. The smell during application wasn't as bad as I figured it'd be, and it was gone within minutes (it was very weak). It feels completely dry about 24 hours later, although the surface felt dry within about 30 minutes (but it was still easy to rub off with the soft part of your finger; obviously because the adhesion hadn't completely dried).Caulking can be extremely fun, but if you're new, do your research, get a good caulking gun, and absorb all you can before starting your project. This product will not let you down, though!"
3,Problematic,The buttons on the clock intermitently function. It takes many attempts to set it. After you set it and you press a button to read date it resets to 12:00 and you need to start all over again.
3,Very cheap but works,"This clock is nothing fancy at all. All plastic and the buttons don't have a good feel when pressed. $5 is a lot to pay for it, but I wanted a cheap way to see the time on my motorcycle and a nice metal clock would be $40 or so. I doubt it will last in the rain but I wouldn't blame the clock if I get caught in the rain.I've been using the clock for a month or so now, it did reset itself once for some reason but it wasn't hard to set again."
1,Battlefield 2 Logitech Headset,"Since I did not receive the game, this is not a review of the game but rather an observation of AMAZON's Process.I too am a Victim of receiving a headset with no game. The odd thing is that I don't remember any warnings when I ordered the game that stated I needed to order both the headset and the game. One would think that function would be automated. Especially since I got the headset today!!! I could understand if I got the headset weeks ago, but since they go together wouldn't you think they would be shipped together? This is truly an asinine way to run a business. Granted I have never had problems so far, but there isn't even any good recourse to ensure that I will get the game other than writing an e-mail and waiting for a response. AMAZON.....In the future, you should tie dependant items together so that when you order one you get the other as well automatically. You will have a much more satisfied customer in the end.Thanks for Nothing.....Literally"
1,What a bunch of crap.,"These fools couldn't figure out that they had ""made an error""? I was told ""we have millions of items on our website and this doesn't happen often."" Newsflash: IT DOES! So now I get a 10 dollar gift certificate meaning I'll have to spend more money with them to try to make up for them not giving me the game on the date the game was released...what a nice ploy.Congrats on realizing this error the DAY THE GAME CAME OUT."
1,Another case of not receiving the game,Really pathetic. Will never attempt to preorder anything from Amazon again.
1,I have been crushed,These three letters barely represent my angry at a P.O.S. headset and no game W-T-F?!! There are no words to describe the stupidity here.
1,How stupid can you be.,"I wish I could review the game, but since you only sent the headset, I would not know how. I have sent e-mail after e-mail trying to get the game sent, and never receive any reply. While I do like the headset, it's not worth $44.00. Hopefully someday common sense will return to the world and you will send me the bloody game (which I paid for.)"
1,Amazon....not anymore,"I Love Amazon.......but not anymore Thx......This game meant alot too me i've been waiting for it since i saw a video of it last year....Like somone else said, i loved the game so much i preorderd to get it ASAP and to make sure i get one....but no thanks to amazon...here i am waiting agian...and in teh E-mail it sais a total certifacate ammount of $58.00,right so why did it only come out as $57's off?? and the 2 days shipping u promised me didn't seem to be included eihtur..considering it said it costed an extra $7...WOW thanks amazon...You suck"
2,Nice quality - Not Convenient - Sorry I bought it,"Very good quality, but not very convenient. Too big for the storage provided (for a small camera, it's pretty thick - lots of wasted space). Belt clip is not secure enough - a belt loop would have been better. Magnetic latch not strong enough - velcro or snap would have been better (magnets around memory cards make me nervous anyway!). I'm going to find a different case - this one just doesn't cut it."
2,Looks nice but too big,"A well made, nice looking case but far too large for an R507. Putting the camera in this case practically doubles the size of the camera and defeats the purpose of having a small camera. I suspect this is a consequence of the fact that this case is designed to fit so many different cameras. I returned it almost as soon as I received it and purchased a small, leather non-HP case which is exactly the size of the camera."
4,Nice If you don't mind bulky.,"This case is very well made. It has alot of room for extras like battteries and memory cards. It's just larger than I expected, hoped for a slimmer case than this. Its made with a puffy leather, not really needed since case is so large. Great case otherwise."
5,Great Level,"This is a great level. The size is perfect.... not too small and not too big. It easily fits in a tool pouch or tool box, so there is no excuse to not have a good level with you. It has the usual Stabila quality, so it's accurate and rugged."
4,Cute!,"I bought this for my daughter for her panda-themed nursery. It's plush, soft, and very cute! Feet have some additional weight to them with bean-bag type fill."
5,Do you reccommend?,"This bear looks just adorable and i want to ask for it for Christmas. But i would like to know if it's even worth asking for. I would like to know if it is a)as cute as the pic makes it seem. b) durable, because I'm ten and my brother is 4, so it needs to be able to stand the wear and tear. C)soft, cuddly, and brush able because I love to brush my dolls. And D) are there any better 12"" panda bears on the market. Feel free to respond and i will be checking back every week :)"
3,average,These towels where very thin. Would not recommend using them to wash or dry a clear coated vehicle surface. Best used to clean windows and the interior.
3,Too Expensive but nice balloon,"My husband bought this for our 18 month old daughter when she had eye surgery. The only reason why it seemed like a good purchase is because she had surgery and not because any balloon is worth eight to ten bucks. The balloon itself is good, lasted a long time and my daughter loved it but still the price tag on this thing is annoying.If you do buy it save it after it deflates and ask a party store near you to inflate it again, most will do it for free."
5,How to paint murals and Trompe L'oeil,what makes this book special is the clear instructions on 1) color it shows you the colors on a pallete so there easy to match with any brand they even have a paint directory 2) the list of supplies are put clearly in a grey box in the corner of the page makes an easy shopping list 3) excellent pictures of tools in action 4) lots and lots of templates. History Instruction and Inspiration it's all there!
3,not what I was looking for,"I purchased this book hoping to get some good pointers on how to move from landscape painting into the mural stage, but I found the book quite simplistic. It would be a great guide if you are wanting a fast, simple, stencil-look, but not for the serious artist."
4,"How to Paint Murals, etc. by V. Ellerton","This book has lovely pictures - it definitely is helpful in determining how to paint certain types of simplistic murals, but is not detailed enough for intense scenes, skies, landscapes, etc. A good book to start out with if you are interested in how to paint murals."
2,How to Paint Murals if you are expierienced!!!,"I purchaced this book to get another perspective on painting murals. I am a beginner and I found that only the mid to advanced artist, would enhance their ability to do murals. This book is not for beginners!!! I have since purchaced other books that deal with all levels from the beginner to the advanced and felt I could follow and learn more as I gain confidence and expierience. I have not opened the book since, Maybe in 5 years I may relate more to it. Sorry. JR"
5,one of the greatest disco Album from salsoulII,"This CD is remastered from original master tape,not vinyl!!"
2,"suena muy bien pero...tiene una voz "" peculiar ""","Impulsado por el comentario del Sr. Guzman ha caido entre mis manos este CD. Bueno, lo que realmente me ha impulsado a comprarlo es que esta grabado en SIGMA SOUND STUDIOS en el año 76 y que esta producido y arreglado por Vincent Montana teniendo detrás a la MFSB y las Sweatheart of Sigma,(Carla Benson, Evette Benton y Barbara Ingram ). Este coktail debería ser explosivo pero...esta artista tiene una voz muy ""peculiar"", especial, demasiado ""profunda"" ( ¿Lou Rawls en femenino? ). No sé, tiene algo que repele un poco.A pesar de todo me quedo con el tema "" This Time May Be The Last Time "", ya me le he pasado a mi Ipod a la lista "" Philly Sound ""."
1,Slipping Straps,"I admit I bought one of these because it came in a good bag. But that was it. First, it took me more than a half hour just to figure out how to tie the straps. The D-rings connectors and instructions were a little confusing. When I finally tightened it on my car and put my boards in it, it just never really tightened down. There's a long bumpy road to my break...and the straps over the boards kept getting loose from the road vibration. Also, the front rack lifted in the wind and the back rack dented the roof of my car. I ended up tossing the rack in the back of my garage...but the bag it came in is great for keeping wax and other stuff."
2,Straps slip,"On our former car (may it rest in peace) the rack worked well. However, on our current vehicle the straps slip, particularly in the front where the boards (in cases) are pushed upwards from the wind. The straps are designed to be cinched and held in place by the door. On our latest trip, I had to pull the straps from the inside to ensure it didn't loosen during transit. How annoying."
3,"Nice book, but sloppy editing","I found this book to be a useful addition to the Matlab user-manual. Editing, however, could have been better. There are simply too many little annoying writing and spelling errors, and the coverage of certain Matlab commands sometimes lacks a logical structure. Having said that, I still would recommend the book for Matlab users who want to explore advanced graphics or GUI-design."
2,Mostly trivial recipes,May be a good source of reference for a beginner in .NET but most of the recipes don't tackle any tough problems. A lot of what is in this book can be easily obtained from free sources such as MSDN online ...
5,Me rogers rocks,"Still the best there ever was! If everyone in the world cared for children the way Fred Rogers did, and the children of the world paid attention to that care, there might not be any war or crime."
1,What a wasted opportunity,"I never saw ELP live but I remember seeing the movie of Pictures (along with 'Woodstock' and 'Grave New World' - a fantastic triple bill) back in the early 70's. That was a good version. This version, with all the needless psychedelic add-ons is dreadful. There is a place for cartoons and psychedelia - for example, they were an integral, and I think valuable, part of The Old Grey Whistle Test - but here, they are totally distracting and disruptive. I cannot bear to watch this movie. (Of course, the music is good.)As with many other commenters, I hope that at some time the real video is released."
1,Do Not Buy,"DO NOT BUY! This is the worst video I have ever seen. Most of the best bits are COVERED over with someone showing off their immature psychedelic color washing or comic book pictures. If you want to SEE the musicians play, DO NOT GET this video. I should have listened to the one star comments! It seems that who ever added the junk to this concert hated ELP and didn't want you to see them. I wish my one star could be a negative 5."
2,Great performance overshadowed by special effects,"For a collector its worth it. The music and live performance is ELP historic. The special effects layered over the live performance takes away from your imagination. Thats the sole purpose of a live DVD performance, no distractions. The music is great. Greg Lake sounds perfect. Its my opinion, that it was a distraction using multi-colored special effects... Its worth having, tough to watch."
2,"Good Bonus Material, Crappy Main Feature","The psychedelic stuff did not look good and there was way to much of it in the main part of the feature. It gave me the impression that somebody might have been on a bad acid trip when the originally put the film together? The psychedelic stuff was terrible and way to much of it was shown, The sound quality was better than what I was expecting. I suggest just putting it in your player and doing chores around your home and just listenning to the sound. However, I really enjoyed the bonus material and it is worth watching. I thought it was far better than the main feature."
4,cultural studies...an introduction,"This book offers an excellent introduction into the world of cultural studies. Written by some of the most renowned scholars in the field, it discusses the key issues raised in the explorations of contemporary culture: identity and communication, cultural production and consumption, postmodernism. An important book for anyone seeking a multiparadigmatic representation of current social science debates on the ""old"" notion of CULTURE.Ozren Pupovac, University of Zagreb, Croatia"
1,Somebody smoked their breakfast!,"A tire comes to life and kills people?Oh yeah, it could happen. Right.People buy this trash? Right.Go back to a sitcom and enjoy the laugh track.Mindless, fetid excrement. Right.To think a camera was destroyed, just filming this sewage.A mind is a terrible thing to waste on this film - unless you are really baked!I guess you could turn it into a drinking game of some sort -you have to take a shoot of liquor for every stupid scene...Better buy a half gallon!"
3,ROFL,"This movie had me laughing at the sheer absuridity of a tire that's alive, and blowing things up. LOL I figure this movie is at least a one time see. Just go into it with stupid fun in mind."
2,Does not live up to the trailer,"This movie definitely failed to live up to the trailer which piqued my curiosity. Thought it would be a cross between Reno 911 and Tremors. Honestly not enough humor, suspense, or story to keep this movie interesting. The side plot of the audience watching the filming also fell flat and was very distracting. Much rather would have seen a campy horror movie than this."
5,Easily the best movie I have ever seen.,"This movie illustrates several important and compelling issues in our society.Principally, the importance of tire safety. Secondly, the very real threat of a tire uprising. We must always consider the small things.A true masterpiece."
3,Rubber coming,"Rather psychotic story of a car tire becoming a destructive force and sharing this out-of-this-world ability with other rubber rubbish around.It is hard to catch a meaning of this delusive tale if even on fashionable save-the-planet merit.Nice music, good cinematographic skills-nothing to watch and remember afterwards but an brain-rich tire."
2,Meet Robert,"this was an odd movie, it was okay not one of the best films i've seen magnet did better with Black Death. when i saw the trailer to this i thought what the hell i'll try it. and it was horrible. i did not understand the motive to this film at all. except that there is a killer tire. it was weird i'll give you that if the director was aiming for that he did a good job. but all in all i won't see it again. if you have not seen this movie i recommend that you don't"
2,It was a waste of my money....but,"Its like in the 70's when short movies by unknown homedirectors started to come out... all associated with the films think their movieis great caused its so different but i always saw them as wanna be home movies.this is a quality wanna be ....some will love it cause its different and more willlike it cause it does'nt follow the same protocol as most movies today.The only good thing about the version i bought is the 3d cover on the dvd.Instead of CGI to give the Tire better life, all we get is good angles at rollingaround and the tire shakes when it gets mad...and...Bottom Line...Boring. Eventhe exploding heads cant save this DVD.Use as coaster after view."
1,This is the Gigli of Satirical Movies,"I felt compelled to watch this movie after seeing glowing reviews from other people and Total Film. And after I watched it I asked 'Why would someone make a movie like this?"" The answer: 'No reason'. I also ask 'Why should you watch it?' again, no reason. Annoying, huh? So is this movie. It thinks it's much funnier than it is. I couldn't muster up even a chuckle.So you say, I don't get it. Maybe. But I'm not an average viewer who needs to be spoon fed the plot. But I do expect in a dark comedy to smile, laugh or chuckle. Nothing.Imagine if someone combined Castaway with Special Dead, stir in a dead pan delivery and you have this movie. It's slow, with no climax and the ending, while not abrupt, does cop out (pun intended). I won't comment on the acting because apparently, that was intentional.Do not buy this without renting it first. And for God's sake no need to buy the blu-ray version."
1,I was looking forward to this movie...,"but seriously? Rented the pre-theatrical on-demand release and eagerly watched it last night! Failed to live up to my expectations though. Pretentious satirical commentary about the state of modern film industry. I get it. Everything happens in a movie for ""no reason"". I get that too. So what? The acting appears uninspired, there are long drawn out scenes with minimal action or dialogue, and no real plot advancement to maintain one's interest. I've seen some dreadful movies over the years, and enjoyed a good number of them more than any rational viewer ought to admit, but this gimmicky non-sense shouldn't endure for the hour and twenty minutes that it does. Just awful. Can I have my $10 back?"
2,Lets be honest.,"Im just going to throw this out here. You will be extremely bored at points. But the film does have a few laughs, all of which are from the officer at the beginning of the film making the intro, or the later half of his dialogue. Guy was awesome.My only plea is that people quit reviewing movies over idea/originality, rather then entertainment. This could of been a great 10 minute short film, but dragged into a full length bore. I get it, you think different... but this isnt high school. You Rebel, you...I wont say steer clear of this, but just know what your getting yourself into. Its Napoleon Dynamite with a Tire that rolls around making heads explode. Maybe 4 or 5... FX were great atleast. Almost above par. The story line is almost funny if it were like I said, 10 minutes long.In the end, its Hit or Miss. If you have Netflix, watch it instantly online like I did. Or rent this. Maybe grab a alcoholic beverage and some pizza. Dont buy the film. Just dont."
1,Rubber,This movie was worse than Killer Tomatoes. What food or inanimate object will kill next.I'm afraid to find out.
4,"An homage to ""No reason""","After I watched this I thought it was the sort of movie that would do well at the Philly Film Fest. Apparently I missed it last year. It's a little slow, but I couldn't turn it off, wondering what would happen and sort of riveted by WTF?It's pretty out there, but well-acted and well-written."
3,Not for Everyone,"My husband, son and I (ages range from 38 to 67) watched this movie together, we decided it's not for everyone. But if you like weird, strange, little movies, this one is for you. I can't say I really liked it, but I can't say I didn't. It's interesting how they made this tire seem alive, you could almost sense it thinking. I'm not sure what they were trying to get across, but what can I say, we watched it ""for no reason"".....see the movie."
1,Worst movie ever! (but worth seeing once),Words cannot express how bad this movie is. I enjoy quirky movies now and then but this is just plain dumb. It actually starts off okay but quickly rolls down hill (pun intended) from there. The only bright spot with this movie is the fact that after watching you can truly say you have seen the worst movie of all time.
5,Quirky and Funny,"I'm not much of a movie connoisseur, so I found Rubber to be hilarious. I've actually watched it twice now. It's so weird that I found it enjoyable and funny."
4,Strange fun,"Great movie for the warped of mind , got it for a gift, go' n to put gift giver on my Christmas card list for life :)"
4,Very Good Flick,"I purchased this movie as a fan of Mr. Oizo's music, having not seen any of his film work outside of the ""Flat Beat"" music video. I watched it with my Dad, and told him ""I can promise this movie will be weird, and hopefully good."" He loves B movies and old horror movies, and he loved it. It definitely lived up to the expectation of being bizarre, but was also a very quality film beyond that. I would recommend it. If you are familiar with Mr. Oizo's other works it really shows just how capable of an artist he is."
1,Not usable; defective construction.,"I bought the item this past November, ahead of time for a trip this year. It looked fine from the outside but I did not inspect it more closely since I did not need it right away. Well, I just tried to fill it out and to my big disappointment, neither lid (the inner one with the holes and the outer one to close)hold on to the dispenser. I hope they are not all like this, but I cannot use it, since it will not hold close. Too late to return... :-("
5,My pill dispenser,"I love my Progressive Vitamin dispenser. I have looked for it for close to a year because I already have one and wanted another. I even called the company. Where did I find it? Amazon! I love it because it is so easy to use. It has six bins and you fill each one with a LOT of pills. No weekly refilling. It is great! When I go on a trip, I just fill the bins that are low and go. It's so easy. I have two of them. One for my morning pills and one for my evening ones. I highly recommend this product to those on medication. It has an A+ from me."
4,Good one,Best design of it's type; no flexing lid to come loose.Very convenient way of storing and dispensing pills.Done.
5,Vitmin container,Very handy container. I had a container just like this one and it last for about14 years before I drop it and crack the plastic container.
1,Worthless dispenser,"This is an insanely stupid design. Nothing bigger than an aspirin can fall thru the hole! And all vitamins are much bigger than aspirins. Maybe it's a drug dispenser, but NOT a vitamin dispenser. Plus, I bought two of them, returned them and received credit for only one. Go figure."
5,Great for Memorizing Scripture!,"This comes with perforated cards with Bible verses. I can easily tuck a card or two into my wallet and work on memorizing Scripture when I am waiting in traffic or have a couple spare minutes. You can choose which ""version"" you want to use---NIV, KJ, NKJ,or NASB---all four are included. Well worth the $$"
1,No Insight Here,"I don't know what the publisher was thinking when they published this book. The things learned like be a team player and go after your goals, etc are so commonplace and have been said a billion times before. What stricks me as rather funny is that the author is a grown woman and she should have learned these things long ago--not from Bill Porter. Someone thinks that either readers are a little naive or the author must be naive to have learned such commonsense at such a mature age. This book is all about sales and marketing and trying to put a square peg into a round hole. The book does not work and it is not worth the money!"
1,A Very Negative Book,"The narrative here just comes to a standstill right about on page 15 and is filled with too many details for an inspirational book. I was not inspired at all. The writing for the most part is dull, plain and flat. The pictures inserted into the text look homespun and in need of a professional photographer. I am sorry I bought this book."
3,Shelly get out of the way,"I think the book suffered a great deal, because Shelly was trying so hard to steal Bill's thunder. There was way too much Shelly and not enough Bill. I would like to have known more about Bill and less about Shelly."
2,Where is Bill???,"After reading this book I felt I really did not know Bill Porter. I got to know the author pretty well, but Bill remained a mystery to me. Not sure if I got my money's worth, but there were some parts that were okay."
1,Shelly Brady: I want to tell my own story,"I desperately wanted to learn something about the human spirit from Bill Porter. I wanted to learn about courage, strength and the ability of the human will to go beyond what most of us encounter in our daily lives. Instead, I was treated to the life story of shelly brady. Atleat Mrs. Brady admits in the book that she is a ""Ham"" for the spotlight. I admit that I have not finished the book and probably will not because of my frustration with Mrs. Brady. She has taken a wonderful story and made it all about herself."
2,"Great person, flawed book","""Ten Things I Learned from Bill Porter"" is ideal for someone who has seen the TV movie ""Door to Door"" or is otherwise ALREADY familiar with, and inspired by, the story of Bill Porter.The book, unfortunately, is poorly written. Each chapter comes across as if it were conceived independently of the others. Biographical information about Bill Porter is repeated numerous times, and a fair amount of time is spent talking about the author's own life issues. Halfway through the book I found myself skimming paragraphs and whole pages, looking to get back to the thrust of the story about Bill Porter.If you are looking for a biography of Bill Porter, this is not it. If you are very hungry for any additional information about Porter, this book may be worth your time."
1,A Major Disappointment,"The TNT special about Bill Porter's life was wonderful, but this book has much to be desired. There is too much Shelly in the book and not enoough Bill. Bill seems to play second fiddle in a book about himself, which is just silly. The tone of the book is so self-serving that it pains the reader and what looks like a biography is nothing more than positive PR. I wish I could have learned more about Bill, his life, his thoughts instead of having to wade through the writing of an self-serving, ego loving author."
5,Inspirational,"I am amazed not only by the incredible journey that Bill Porter has embarked upon throughout this life, but also the amazing journey that his mother and father anxiously and fearlessly chose to take. In a day and age that would have preferred and accepted a much easier way out than to confront Bill's disability, his parents were determined for Bill to see that his greatest obstacle could become his greatest strength. It is evident in the life of the author Shelly Brady that Bill Porter's story has impacted the lives of many, and it is certain that his example will continue to have a great influence on generations yet to come. This story truly exemplifies the phrase ""Each life that touches ours for good, reflects thine own great mercy Lord."" Some people come into our lives and go as quickly as they came, others leave footprints, and we are never the same. Bill is one of those people!!!! Shelly Brady--You are Bills angel here upon this earth!!!"
4,A bit of rambling,"This is a great story and a quick read. I didn't think that it was that well written, Shelley seems to repeat herself and ramble on and on. It had a great message though"
4,First Dorothy Garlock Book,"This is my first Dorothy Garlock book and I will be looking for her other books to read. I got a little tired of the bad language in the book and the end was a little disappointing. I would have liked for her to have gotten them married and for the other brother to have come home. However, it kept my attention all the way through and I read it in two days. She is a good writer and I am looking forward to her other books."
1,Severely Dissapointed,"This book disgusted me so much. Unlike other romances I have read, this one had no plot at all. A girl finds her sisters being mistreated, she runs away to the west, and meets a guy, they fall in love, and she helps him get better after an injury intended for his brother. It was very very ""corny"" (for lack of a better word). I'm sorry, but I'm an avid historian, and 99.9% of men didn't, and still don't, get all ""mushy"" over a woman. The ending was very dissapointing, where the brothers finally got to ""get it on"" with their new wives that they were so much ""in love with"". I found it nauseating how the two couples said the exact same words while making love, at the exact same time, in two different places. Dissapointing, and a waste of my money."
3,A bit too hard,"These paintballs were too hard to reliably pop when used with a .40 caliber blowgun. (Fewer than 1 in 10 popped on the first shot when fired at a 4x4 wood target from 10 ft. away.) On the plus side, there were no popped paintballs in the bag when it arrived via usps."
3,A well crafted thriller,"""This tongue-in-cheek thriller involves the abduction of a woman, an insidious threat of sexual violation, and an impending murder, and gives a powerful portrait of two mutilated lives -- the victim and the criminal who are psychologically dependent on each other: Gladys Hebe D'Onofrio, a 35-year-old sculptor of little achievement, now frightfully alone, tormented by sexual fantasies and perpetually in search of the ideal lover; and Leo Druscovich, an outwardly confident and successful art critic and editor, deeply troubled by a terrible guilt that surfaces in his repeated sexual failures.""As usual, Manuel Puig uses many devices in telling the story. Each chapter has a different structure and style. It is interesting to see how the seemingly disjointed stories all come together to make sense in the end. It is an interesting read. That's all I have to say about this book."
1,"Disturbing, saturated with vivid sexual images","I used to think that movies were the most vivid forms of media available until I read this book. Being a required book for my Spanish literature class in detective novels, I bought it with the naivity to think that college courses would be at least somewhat screened. But I was apalled to find EXTREMELY graphic sexual descriptions that excited the emotions far more profoundly than the most vivid R-rated movie one could find. Never mind the ""brilliance"" of the story line. I could not agree with the first reviewer more. One with any conscience of God's law at all would not be able to even begin to enjoy the story line because of the dominant theme of sexuality, immorality, violence, and the like that pervades the entire story. If this book is a class requirement for you, I would suggest you talk with the professor to see if he/she can make other arrangements for your reading."
5,Another Genera On The Horizon?,"This album exceeded my expectations. It is a slight departure from Rhapsody and Luca's debut solo album. It contains the mainstay instruments of the genera such as chorus, symphony, heavy guitars, and blazingly fast meter. However, it adds a significant amount of electronica. At first listen, I was a tad 'put off' by this but upon listening further I decided that this enhanced the music considerably. It gives the music a dark, theatrical, John Carpenter like undertone.I believe this unique combination of instruments and composition hints of something that can be extended upon much further perhase even into yet another metal sub-genera. At any rate, this shows that Luca's talent is far from stagnation and he'll likely be surprising us for sometime to come.I would highly recommend this album to any symphonic metal fan."
4,Like Rhapsody? You'll like this.,"Luca Turilli is the songwriter and guitarist for the power metal band Rhapsody, and ""Prophet of the Last Eclipse"" would not be too out of place in Rhapsody's catalogue. There are really only a few differences. Turilli incorporates some electronic elements in this album, which give it more of a sci-fi feel. And the vocalist is different. He's good, though I prefer Fabio Lione. One good thing is that there's no narration. The cheese level is still pretty high, but not so high as it gets in Rhapsody.The bottom line is that if you like Rhapsody, you will almost certainly enjoy Luca Turilli's solo efforts, and if you don't like Rhapsody, you should probably stay away. This brand of power metal is for those of us who like things over-the-top every once in awhile, and don't mind cheesy lyrics as long as the music is strong."
4,CD-RW,I had 1 c/d that recorded awful. I should have erased it and tried copying a different c/d with it. I didn't do that. All & all good product. Just burns to slow.
1,It can not work at all,"When I try the disc in my DVD-RW, it could not be written at all. And when I go back to my old discs, they could still work. SO VERY VERY BAD DISC. BE CAREFUL."
3,Chinese Intellectuals and the West,"Chinese intellectuals and the West, 1872-1949,I have taken a class from Professor Wang.I can say that Dr Wang has a very strict scholarship and his personal standards are extremely high. I cannot fault his scholarship. It is my personal feeling that Dr Wang regreted teaching in the West at my school at Queens College, City University of New York, and literally could not wait to return to Taiwan. My impression as a student of Dr Wang is that he has strong prejudice against the West and a preference for Chinese culture."
5,What a great sound!,"I just finished listening to the CD and it's great! The singer has just an amazing voice! This isn't one of those '2 good song' cd's, every song on here is really great. I highly recomend this CD for anyone into this style of music."
3,NOT a John Candy Movie,"This really should be considered false advertising. John Candy plays a VERY small part in this movie, although he does have a couple of very funny lines and one hilarious scene. That being said, the plot of the movie is not high brow in any sense, and it's sort of dated, but it is amusing and fun.The main characters are actually Stefanie Powers, Anthony Newly, and Isaac Hayes, all of whom play roles with which they are not usually associated, which made their characters interesting for me. It was also fun to see Yvonne DeCarlo and few other familiar TV faces.If you are a John Candy fan, and you are looking to buy this movie primarily to see him, you will likely be disappointed. If you are looking for a bit of mindless entertainment, this movie just might do it."
2,disappointed,I gave this movie to my husband because he is a big John Candy fan. I did not know that John Candy was barely in the video almost like a cameo. I was disappointed and so was my husband
4,Very Nice Unit,"I've had alot of Palms and Palm-like units in my day. Tungsten T is the best so far. I'm still a bit nervous that I'm going to pull it open some day and it's gonna break in two, but otherwise it's fast, and has a great screen. Bluetooth is nice for syncing with your computer (laptop) or another Palm user. All-tolled a very nice Palm unit...I wish it had more memory but you can always buy a card for that so it's not a huge problem. Fits great in a shirt pocket."
3,OK but Battery was NG,"I realize that the sale was ""as is"". But said it worked the last time it was used which was April of 2008 (from the ROM memory. I had to buy a new replacement Battery and it worked great after it was installed. Not like a calculator, it takes a bit of skill to replace battery without destroying unit."
1,"Worst Product, Worst Company!","Had nothing but problems with this thing. Constant freezes, bugs and data loss. This was my 3rd and last Palm device. Swore off PDAs until picking up a BlackBerry 8700g years later. Customer services was ok when in Canada, but the Indian based employees were atrocious (nothing against India - the India based customer services for Dell Computers is excellent). The Palm customer service employees there at the time would answer out of a text and if there was no answer would promise calls by tech support engineers (I never received one that had been promised) or they would pass off the problem or try to blame the customer.Palms are simply no longer relevant. Go with an iPhone or BlackBerry. This company should be out of business!"
2,Skip it/Dont buy,"The autotype feature does NOT work. It behaves erratically. Palm conduit for Mac does NOT sync with Entourage notes, a huge shortcoming.The system crashes every 2 or 3 days, requiring a reboot at usually inopportune times.Blue tooth connectivity using your phone as a modem is very UNRELIABLE. support ""punted"" and directed me to Sony Ericsson, who ""punted"" and sent me back to Palm, who said basically: ""too bad""Battery life is also an issue. The cradle and the car charger do not firmly connect to the Palm, wiggle your desk or slightly budge your palm going over a speed bump, no more connection.While the battery lasts a long while, recharging it is a neat trick ESPECIALLY if you are on the move. Isnt being on the move the whole point behind a PALM?Dont buy it. It is another example of a promising product crippled by shortcomings and poor execution. Dont let the sleek external design fool you. It is a time burner and not a time saver."
2,Annoying digitization problem,"Although I was happy initially with my Tungsten T, I am no longer happy because it needs to be redigitized several times a day. I am a teacher and use it for a lot of data entry, calculation, and organizing and it is time consuming and aggravating to have to double-check all the time to ensure that the correct item is going in the correct field. I was dismayed to discover within these reviews that this is a glitch that is endemic to all model T's. I am even more upset to discover that it eventually just breaks! At the price I paid, I expected to get several years of use out of it. I am hesitant to replace a defective product with a product from the same company, especially if Palm is not backing up their product with a meaningful solution (as is reported elsewhere in these reviews)."
2,Its not good!!,"I hardly like mine at all!! When I put the memory card in, it deletes all the stored data on it.It keeps freezing up when I end up having to hard reset it, which is really annoying.I also think the RAM memory could be better."
3,"Good evolution, but difficult to use","The screen is great, and the processor is fast, but you have to question whether its worth the extra width, extra weight and the inconvenience of having to open a slider every time you want to write something. Also, many of the applications for Palm have not been upgraded yet to run under Palm OS 5.Its schizophrenic: it really does compete well with the Ipaq for multimedia, etc., but how many really need that stuff (or haven't already moved to a Pocket PC, if thats what they want)I returned it after a few weeks, and went back to my 515, which is simply (to me) more convenient both to carry and to use."
3,"This is an ""OEM"" product !","I received a PDA Tungten T that is in a repackaged box, no manuals and software CD. I wrote an e-mail to the seller, they replied to me: ""If you read the ad specific to KM Electronics, you will see that our item is sold OEM (meaning without manual, software, CD or box)...., and You are quoting from Amazon's site which is different from ours and different from where you purchased. We are a ""sub-store"" of Amazon with our own product description. We do not offer the software, etc. However, feel free to return your item according to our policy below.......,As stated in our Amazon return policy, if you must return a product we charge a $15 restocking fee...."""
1,Recalibration problem,RECALIBRATION ! For me that's the main problem of Palm products. I had a Palm V and after a while I could not use it anymore because of calibration problem. No warranty ! Lost money. That's not fair. It's like having a wonderful girlfriend for a year and suddenly she broke up with me. I still love her but doesn't work ...
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE FROM DAY ONE. MANY, MANY HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH TECH SUPPORT. AFTER SENDING IT IN FOR HARDWARW REPAIRS IT CAME BACK TOTALLY NON-FUNCTIONAL. THEY WANT [MONEY] TO REPLACE THE JUNK. IT STILL IS UNDER WARRANTY AND EXTENDED TECH SUPPORT WAS ALSO PURCHASED.DO,T BUY THIS!"
3,Quality questionable,"When these earrings arrived, I was a little disappointed. Mine were barely pushing 6.5mm, and were much smaller than I was expecting. The color and luster was beautiful, perhaps even more shiny than the picture and the backs seemed sturdy enough. If that was the only issue, I gladly would have kept the earrings, however as I was scanning the ""appraisal certificate"" I noticed some typos (which you can clearly see if you look at the picture of the certificate!). Example: ""...sat water pearls..."" rather than SALT water pearls. I find it hard to believe any reputable company would have typos on a certificate, and because of this, I question their quality/authenticity. If you are looking for pretty black pearl earrings, these get the job done, but I decided to get my $100 back and put it towards a pair I KNEW was good quality. I guess that is the risk you run ordering jewelry online!"
5,A must for any golfer,"An excellent foundation book for the beginner to low handicap golfer. Ernest Jones through David Eisenberg provides a simple straightforward approach to the basic foundations of golf technique. If you can incorporate the fundamentals explained in this book into your golf game, you will have an excellent foundation to improve your game."
1,Very Technical Very Labourous,"This course was not for me. Instead of a course that would guide one into a state to receive or project out this is a hard nose fast pace exercise. The exercises are difficult and have a series of indepth info sheets that must be filled out and then all combined to come up with your target. Also, the homework you must do requires an outside person picking targets for you putting them in envelopes and numbering them. This is not a relaxed technique but like taking an entrance exam or those tedious Iowa tests we had in school.All in all from what I did I found it stressful, overwhelming with the amount of work needed to do all the different levels of identifying a target and the inability to get the homework done. Needless to say I did not identify any targets so I may have been frustrated with that too. I only viewed the first two DVD's. JB"
4,osmond 50th DVD,"enjoyed the video, a little dark for the background and would have liked to see the brothers in a dance routine. Their voices are still well worth listening to."
5,Great Memories,"I saw this on PBS and had to have a copy. It's a great ride down memory lane. The only part I didn't like was Donnie and Marie's segment singing their old songs, they did it as a medley so only a short piece of each song was sung. But overall, it was great!"
3,Not Highlights,"This is the concert aired on PBS. While it is probably not the full concert it is not hightlights of songs, rather some songs they do as a medley. Meaning they sing some of the song then do some of another. They do that for 5 songs in a row. It is clear that it is a medley when you see it."
2,Very American!,"The Osmanods in Concert In Las Vegas is a good collection of songs from the group. It has an emphasis on Donny and Marie, which I guess is okay.The real bugbear for this D.V.D. is the ridiculous cost of shipping for such a relatively cheap D.V.D. - that is totally unnecessary - it could have been shipped alot cheaper than I was charged."
2,ok,It is only highlights of the conert.None of the songs are performed in full.I was very disappointed I was expecting a concert.
2,False advertising ...this is not a Concert..it's a hodge podge,"So many of the song performances are mere samples of their work..no complete version of ""yo-yo"" or ""one bad apple""..Donny and Marie go through an all too brisk ""medley"" of songs they sang together.Why does Marie sing ""The Sound Of Music"" in its entirety then feature a mere clip of her midway through her monster hit ""Paper Roses"". A great Osmonds performance of ""Let Me In'' is also painfully short.It's a good DVD that could have been so much better ..and at the risk of sounding cold, why did they feature time with those two brothers who never performed in the group??? I expected a complete Osmonds Concert show with hit songs played in their 3 minute glory and not a ""Cliff Notes"" presentation of some the most important songs."
1,Get A Life!,"If you SERIOUSLY watch this and like it, you really need to get a life. I saw this on PBS and hoped it was a Saturday Night Live skit; it was SO bad. Watching paint dry would be more pleasing."
5,Osmond Family Reunion review,"I purchased this for my wife, who is a big Osmond family fan. She enjoyed it immensely! Seeing the brothers together brought back many happy memories for her. Amazon did a great job seeing that it came in time for Christmas."
5,over the moon,I am so happy with this dvd i was really bummed out that they did not come to New Zealand so this was really great to watch.
1,Ugh! Glorified Music-Box Music,"My husband and I are fans of classical music with a substantial CD collection. When we found out we were pregnant, I picked up the Baby Beethoven CD from my local library to see what it was like.It's glorified music box music... some of the pieces are almost impossible to distinguish without checking the jewel case for the name.If you really want to expose your child to Beethoven, don't waste your time with this CD. For soothing sleepy-time music, try ""Beethoven at Bedtime."""
2,Not for babies,"Nothing but synthesizers in the music instead of hearing real instruments. Not enriching for a child, but just to be fair, I had my baby listen to it. He hated it. It's too loud and the music doesn't flow right with the sounds chosen to represent it. My baby kept getting startled. I would not recommend this product; however, I WOULD recommend Baby Mozart, that put my baby to sleep as the music flowed nicely."
2,synthetizer music,"I thought it was just a selection of the most soft and tender or happy melodies but I was very dissapointed when I discovered that it's a synthetizer music!!! Why do that? babyies are able to listen to ""real"" music!! And this caracteristic was not expalined when I bought it!"
3,ok,"This CD is just ok. I like the ""Baby Needs..."" collection much better. The music in this CD is nice, but some of it is fast paced and does not work well to listen to during nap time. My son seems to enjoy it, though. It is nice for playtime."
5,The most scintillating of all that I have read,This is a must read for all who wish to know about the Islamic tradition. And its excellent reading
1,Terrible In-Sole,"All of the other reviews must have been after they recently bought these boots. They are comfortable. The outsoles and leather are durable, but the insole has completely deteriorated in 6 months. I wear these boots on a regular basis for work, so they get good wear. I had a pair of red wings that I had for 10 years. These did not make the cut. Also the stiching is starting to come apart on the boot straps and upper trim."
2,Horrid!,"I've been a really big Erasure fan for quite a number of years now but this cd is just awful. Only three songs (freedon, here in my heart, alien) are worth listening to. The rest sound like a very tired and bored Erasure who just put any old track onto this album. Very poor indeed, Andy & Vince are finished......"
3,Great addition to Erasure's growing library of albums.,"I'd rank most of these songs in the 7's, 8's, 9's, and 10's when it comes to Erasure's greatest hits ever. The only thing I noticed is that this CD needed more engineering. (It could've been my copy only) There was tape hiss, and high pitched noises on the CD.....CD were invented to remedy these problems that plagued audio tapes so it's annoying, at best, to have this on a professionally done CD. Other than the quality of the recording, this is a must buy for Erasure fans."
1,THE BASS IS BAD,It actually is a great album if only you could hear it (the bass is too loud-Flood better get a grip!)
3,"Kind of mellow, but not too bad","I was expecting to hate this CD based on some of the reviews, but it's not that bad at all. Not all the songs hit, but some are quite good. It's got mostly quiet and slow songs, but it makes for some nice back-ground tunes.""Freedom"" kicks off the CD in fine upbeat fashion; ""Where in the World"" is slow, ""Crying in the rain"" is discordant and slow, as is ""Perchance to Dream""; ""Alien"" is more layered in sound (still slow); ""Mad.."" is another slow song (cosmic sounds); ""Here in my heart"" finally moves the pace a little more up-tempo and positive (my favorite on the album), only to follow with ""Love is the Rage"" another slow and minor song; ""Catch-22"" not as slow; ""Moon & Sky"" attempts to be a techno-dance tune, but doesn't quite pull it off, and finally ""Surreal"" ends with another slow tune.I think it's a reflection of the maturing of the duo that the songs are more graceful and not as high energy as previous albums."
3,Turn that boat around,"I've been a completist Erasure fan forever. They've always had a knack for writing sweet, lovable pop tunes which beg to be sung along to. Loveboat still has the pop tunes, but Flood's production is constantly trying to sink the effort in a myriad of ways. First of all, there is no consistency on the sound levels from song to song. One track will have so much bass, the treble is completely drowned. Then the next song will be so soft and muffled one can barely discern a song.The word is that Madonna's Maverick label, who released Cowboy a few years back, have requested that Erasure re-record some of the tracks, record some new ones and re-edit the overall sound before they will release Loveboat stateside. So, hopefully, if there is ever a domestic release, this album will shine for its great songs and not be sunk by unfortunate production."
3,"Love the music, hate the mix.","I know others have said the same, but this CD was almost ruined for me by the terrible mix. I am not a booming bass sort of person, and have never found the mix of previous Erasure tracks to be slanted toward bass, but this CD is so off balance that you can't ignore it. When I bought Loveboat I popped it right in my car CD player for the ride home. After the first track I turned the bass control on my stereo all the way down. It didn't help. After the third track I had to turn it off because the bass was actually making me nauseous. I finally was able to listen to it without getting a headache from the bass, but only by ripping the CD to my Windows Media Player and turning the bass way down. Once I could listen to the songs, I loved them. I listened to the whole CD over and over again. The music (when you can actually hear it over the bass) is great. I hope and pray that the rumors about a re-engineered US release are true."
2,Not very comfortable,"These are not very comfortable because your feet become warm. Due to the plastic foot bed, my feet become sweaty if I don't walk. I should've got ones w/ leather foot bed which doesn't make your feet warm. And these also make your feet look dirty due to the black foot bed, showing that its material is not so good."
5,The Best no-nonsense book on Herbals,"So much bullshit about the use and effectiveness of herbal remedies exists that it's wonderhow any sane person can use herbs as self-medication. This is probably the only book thatoffers a researched summary on the scientific studies into herbs and their effects. Wellreferenced, easy to read (even to a layman like myself) and debunks so many myths thatmost herb fans will be surprised. If you buy this, be sure to get the updated 1995"
3,"Great Seller, not impressed with product",There was a sticker attached to LCD Screen that I could not remove. I would not purchase this product again but would buy from the seller again. They shipped product very quickly!
4,Going My Way_the Complete Series-30 Episodes,Love adding this particular series to my video collection -rare series that's not likely to come one's way anytime in the near future.Continues the adventures of Father O'Malley & Father/monsignor Fitzgibbons.
1,makes me wanna throw up,"cant stand the scent of it but it really does last long, so for those that like it may consider it a good thing."
3,cologne was ok but the shipping was bad,the product is good but the shipping was very slow and the bottle was scratched because it was not packaged properly.
5,The Mind that Rivals Aquinas,"This is not a book for the philosopher timid of heart. Blessed John Duns Scotus is one of the greatest minds that the Franciscan school of thought has produced. He has inspired so much of the work of the Franciscan philosophers and theologians; although it must be said that the Franciscans are very free thinkers. The book contains both selections from the metaphysical texts of Scotus and a commentary by William Frank and Allan Wolter, who have brilliantly unwoven the tightly knit thought of this logical mastermind. Scotus can prove a great challenge for the sheer depth of his work and also because of the modern mind's distance from the time, place, and style within which Scotus wrote. These two commentators provide the avid philosopher ample tools for the successful comprehension of the Scotistic vision of metaphysics, including his highly contraversial theory of univocity (Thomists, please read this with an open mind)."
1,A Disappointment,"West Side Story is one of my favorite Broadway musical scores, and I was looking forward to listening to this recording. What a disappointment! The Prologue starts off wrong by omitting the signature whistle signal of the Jets that is so captivating. The Jet Song is horrid, with an insertion by the Jets gang that sounds like chorus boys from The Producers doing a gig in Las Vegas. The two principals have fine voices, but the casting is totally mixed up. Hayley Westenra as Maria has a lovely American accent, while Vittorio Grigolo as Tony has an operatic Italian accent. So in listening to the recording, you basically have to pretend that Maria (or should I say Mary) is the native-born, and Tony (short for Anton, or should I say Antonio) is the immigrant. Thankfully Anita and the Sharks gang carry themselves well enough. If you want to enjoy a recording of West Side Story, I guess you need to stick to the original cast. Listening to this makes me want to move to the East Side!"
2,Don't believe the hype!,"What a disappointment! I recently purchased this much-vaunted anniversary album and I'm sorry to say it will go into my archive after one play, never to see the light of day again. Talk about a dead performance - from everyone concerned. There is no life in the orchestra : sure, they are note-perfect, but you can practically hear them counting their beats. Not what is needed for one of Braodway's greatest shows. Hayley Westenra as Maria has a nice voice and is well able for the range, but without any show experience delivers a bland, uninteresting performance. Vittorio Grigolo as Tony should not have crossed over from opera. His accent would be more suited to one of the Sharks! Melanie Marshall as Anita is the recording's only saving grace - but not enough to save the show!!Caveat emptor..........."
5,Very good experience!,"I purchased 2 CD's - West Side Story and Vittorio - I have discovered the wonderful tenor Vittorio Grigolo. West Side Story is the new recording of the musical where Toni is sung by Vittorio Grigolo. The CD's came after a few days, and I am enjoying them very much."
5,New dimensions for a timeless score,"As a Hayley Westenra fan, I didn't exactly come into this unbiased. She is indeed in top form, and for one trying this kind of performance for the first time, genuinely amazing. I was expecting to be put off by the international cast and the ""wrong"" accents, but let's face it - opera has been doing this as far back as any of us can remember and no one complains. West Side Story is timeless and every bit as much of a classic in every sense as Carmen or La Boheme. These are classic, though not purist, performances, and they are very, very good. I especially appreciate the orchestra's adherence to the score. Too often in revivals the perpetrators seem to think they can improve on the score/orchestration and end up butchering it instead. Not so here. This is a thoroughly enjoyable recording, but I certainly don't intend to toss out the others."
3,Was Tony from Italy??,"I was really looking forward to this cd, but once I heard Vittorio sing Tony's part it kind of seemed cheap. I am a fan of Vittorio's, but why did he sing a classic piece of music and sound like he just got off the boat?This completely took me out of the production. Who's idea was it anyway??"
5,You won't want to read this at night alone in the house,"On the cover, John Grisham gives this book a quote most authors would die for, while Kirkus Reviews says the ""whole book rushes over you like a jolt of adrenalin,"" and the Los Angeles Times says it is ""quite an achievement.""--it is better than all this, and more. Most unusual, Wilson is an author who's books not only don't sound alike, but he writes in such distinctively separate genres--e.g. this mystery, while also turning out the scientific thrillers Direct Descendant, about DNA being used to bring back a child(s) from the past, and Extinct, about the emergence of the ancestor of the great white shark from the depths of the Marianas Trench. (Don't read this one until AFTER you get back from the beach--if you do.) Extinct is the best for techno/thriller readers, Nightwatcher for mystery fans. They were both best for me"
2,Not impressed,"Not impressed at all. The title is at best a stretch, so don't expect to actually turn 3 in to 2. I underline noteworthy key points in all my books. That is to say information not found in other books thus making the book worth buying. This book had very few things underlined. It is basically the same tired and worn material repeated over and over with a page here and there inserted about a famous player making a great shot. If you buy it used for $4.00 who can complain but I doubt I will ever refer to it again to refresh nuggets of wisdom."
