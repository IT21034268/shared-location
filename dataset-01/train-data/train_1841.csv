3,This Reader is Disappointed,"Having throughly enjoyed the Jake Lassiter series, I was disappointed with Solomon vs. Lord. I felt the author tried too hard to throw in quips and banter which detracted from the plot and from the characters themselves. The plot and characters are appealing, but the rhythm is interrupted too often."
2,Not interesting enough to finish.....,"I couldn't make my way through this one. The Tracy/Hepburn set up turned out to be a one trick pony without Spencer and Kate. If it were a film, I'd say that it lacked chemistry. And mystery.But my biggest problem was the prevalent air of smugness. This wasn't an especially clever book, just one stereotype after another."
5,Heart Tugging Mystery,"Solomon Vs. Lord by Paul LevinePaul Levine crafts irreverent attorneys with delightful mayhem. Steve Solomon is an attorney who strives for justice not necessarily in a legally acceptable manner. Victoria Lord is a by the book, cross the t and dot the i attorney. Their clashes and madcap antics fuel the plot of this delightful mystery.I am a big fan of Lassister, Levine's other attorney protagonist. Now I am a fan of Solomon and Lord. Levine carefully develops the characters and then pits their foibles and strengths against each other to develop an entertaining story line. This book made me laugh out loud more than once.The sidebar characters add richness and flavor to create a colorful montage for setting the story. I suspect I will never look at an avocado in the same way. This is a good mystery with lots of twists and turns as well as plenty of action. It also plucks a pretty good tune on the heart strings.I highly recommend the book."
4,NICE READ,"If you're tired of the usual legal thrillers, give Levine a chance. He puts fun back into the staid courtroom drama.Victoria Lord is struggling to succeed in her career with the DA's office. Steve Solomon is struggling to stay afloat as a--somewhat underhanded--defense attorney. Naturally, they collide. In fact, Steve's indirectly responsible for killing Victoria's dreams by getting her fired!Not satisfied, he connives to force her into a touchy partnership. The defendant in a big-name murder case trusts Victoria enough to hire her, but Steve is the one who knows all the defense tricks.One case, Victoria tells herself. She can handle one case working with him.Sure she can.This is a fun read. The characters are quirky and likable, really easy to bond with.If you're stuck on Grisham and Baldacci, this probably isn't for you. But if you like off-beat entertainment, you'll like Levine."
3,A good read even though it was predictable from the start,"Well, you kind of knew from the start how this was going to end. It was predictable. However, the journey toward that end was enjoyable, the writer writes well and there were a few interestting (though not compelling) twists and turns.If you like an easy to read and follow courtroom drama, then I would recommend this one."
4,Fun,"Fun read, great characters. Will read the others in this series. Light, easy book. Good beach reading. Fun and funny."
5,Levine Keeps Getting Better,"I have one gripe with ""Solomon vs. Lord"" -- at 544 pages, it's too short! I wanted more. Mr. Levine created two wonderful new literary heroes in Steve Solomon and Victoria Lord; they make Spencer and Hepburn look like Ozzie and Harriet. The legal wrangling, quirky courtroom personalities, plot twists, Florida ambience and compelling relationships (note the one between Solomon and his, shall we say, unusually gifted nephew) kept me turning pages late into the night. I got the feeling the author was taking me on a journey through territory that was as familiar to him as it was fascinating to me.I understand Mr. Levine is putting out an S vs. L sequel soon, or number of sequels. All I can say is, hurry up, please.Larry Moskowitz"
4,solomon lord,Reading it now and am enjoying and finding it distracting while I sit with my cat recovering from an injury.
4,Interesting Characters,"There are a lot of justice related stories with male and female lead characters who work together to solve murders, work the legal system, and do their part to help good win over evil. The male and female leads, who are always unlikely matches, find that there are romantic sparks between them. Examples are the TV shows Castle, In Plain Sight, and Bones. I was afraid that this book would follow the same formula. I got a nice surprise. Solomon and Lord are lawyers who see the law from different viewpoints. Ms. Lord is at her first position as a lawyer and feels that justice can be served only by following the laws as written. Mr. Solomon, more experienced in law and the ways of the world, believes in bending the law to see justice be done. Both characters are well developed and the multiple story lines are varied and colorful. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series."
4,Entertaining Read,This book was recommended by a friend who described it as an entertaining read. This is exactly what I found it to be. This book depends on the interaction of the two main characters. The storyline is somewhat simple and a little predictable. Proabably good for a first book in that it helps develop the main characters. Defintitely a nice read that will make you smile a time or two. Will definitely read more in the series.
4,Screwball Comedy at its Best,"This is the first book I've read from Mr. Levine and afterwards, I had to run out and purchase more. I won't reiterate plot details other reviewers have provided but I will recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh.One reviewer remarked that the book is Moonlighting (the old Cybil Shepherd/Bruce Willis TV show) in the courtroom and I couldn't agree more. You do need to suspend disbelief as some of the antics are over-the-top, but once you do, just sick back and enjoy the ride. Solomon vs Lord has it all: romance, a little mystery, family drama, as well as an insider's look into the so-called ""halls of justice"". You'll find yourself laughing out loud and rooting for these quirky characters and the crazy world in which they thrive."
3,Very funny fluff,"I wasn't sure that I was going to finish this book. I bought it because it was FREE; and no risk in that. What keeps me going is the very funny dialogue. It's a beach reading book; but little substance. If you want something light and amusing, good choice; otherwise, find something else."
5,This was a great book.,"As trial mysteries go, I think this was a very good book. I just got back to reading, am downloading a lot of different books, and I'm glad I gave this one a try."
4,Solomon vs Lord,I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters. The story was well-edited. The conclusion was obvious. Bobby is described well and we like him and want his life to improve. The humor helps the story.Beth Bender
4,Down and dirty humor in the lawyer profession,"Struggling, free-wheeling defense lawyer Solomon who flagrantly disregards court protocol, locks horns with Lord, beautiful female lawyer newcomer dedicated to rules of law. Their love/hate relationship had me laughing through a hilarious and completely different kind of murder mystery."
3,Too much,"There is too much description or filler.A good story, hurt by extreme detail of what everyone is wearing or eating."
4,Taste Good-Makes Me Fart,"I do love the taste of this product, always have. But if you eat this and anything else later on, it seems to have some unpleasant chemical reaction.Most protein powders and the like have had this effect on myself and others. Just... make sure you're alone the rest of the day to be safe."
3,stylish but.....,These sneakers are very cute - but not really very comfortable. Not good for long walks - minimal arch support ...
4,It's great!!,"This video, have a GREAT Back Choir and a lot of gospel's artist: Phill Driscol, First Call, 2th Chapter of Acts, The Catedrals, and, in the final part, in the Aleluia, everybody sing in a one great choir... Is wonderful."
5,Fantastic Sountrack to a great movie,"In Yentl Barbra returns to her roots to record songs with a more traditional broadway sound and the results are astounding. It is clear barbra feels passionate about the story she is singing/narrating and one can't help getting caught up in that emotion. Admittedly the material isnt all first rate, the lyrics on some of the songs(Piece of Sky, One of Those Moments etc..) are just rediculous, but Barbra's delivery is so fantastic it's easy to ignore it. On this album you also see Barbra incorporating her ability to belt as well as her ability to sing soft tender music, it's just one of those albums a Streisand fan lives for. get it!"
1,Yentl,I did not get the movie Yentl nor did I get the refund of $9.00 for the CD that I returned. I would still like to get the movie but you said you didn't have it.I would like the refund.Dione Smith
5,talented and inspiring,"Such quality! This represents some of her best efforts and their is a mystical quality as if she is singing of her own experience. It is hard to believe that she masters her voice in intensity, poignancy and sincerity. Great listening"
5,Can't wait for the movie DVD,"One of the few movie I took my mom to see, she really liked it and I LOVED it, cried most of the way thru it. I lost my father too about the same time Yentl did in the movie. All this music stays with me always. Like a lot of Sam Harris music, Barbra and I go way back and her music, Yentl especially is pointent to my life, always striving for the better life the more perfect mate, I LOVE YOU BARBRA!!!!!!! I have an electric sunroof and during a Piece of Sky I open it at the last line of the song and reach my hand up for the sky........"
3,just ok,"Tent is made of quality material and does its job as a 4 season tent. However due to 2 challenges after using for almost two years Ive moved to another tent. One, the doors are hinged on the bottom causing you to tuck it in every time you come or go so you dont step on it, and in bad weather I always tend to get more snow or wet in the tent. Not from leaking but from above, the vestuble is not big enough to close behind me before opening the door. Last, between the tiangle on top there is a spot that collects snow and water causing a person to constantly push it off from inside. Im still tru to Eureka though. Moved into a Equinox,too old to do snow trips anymore,HaHa"
4,Good tent overall,"We bought this tent since we have a little one now and needed more space. This tent lives up to Eureka's good reputation. My only complaint was that one of the pole straps was sewed on upsidedown. Otherwise we have been very happy with this tent. It has kept us warm in subfreezing temps in the Colorado mountains and has plenty of room for three people. This thing is also a beast in bad weather, but that has been true of all my Eureka tents."
2,amazons return policy is great,bent one pole first time setting it up. the floor of tent feels very thin. very expensive for what it is and it is a piece of crap. i bought the kingdom 4 and i like it.
3,50/50,"This movie interestingly does the same the right that it does wrong. What was right? The overall darkness of the movie. When I say darkness I mean pitch black. There are times when you really can't see what is going on and this adds to the overall creepiness. Hasn't it been stated time and time again that the scariest things are the things we can't see, or at least see well? What does this movie do wrong? The overall darkness. Sometimes too much of a good thing isn't good. The entire movie is filmed in the dark. There were several times where I really had no idea what was going on. All I could see was a black screen and all I heard was screaming. Overall, the movie was okay. Better than a lot of other movies I've seen, but for all it does well, it does wrong."
2,BAD MOVIE & was able to get credit from store for renting it:),Yes the scariest thing was the cover & I was COMPLETELY lost when the dark scenes came on. I will try to give it another chance but doubt it.
1,Too Dark and filmed by a person with Parkinsons,I could not finish this movie as it was too dark and camera shook so much I couldn't tell what the heck was going on.
1,Rubbish,Attack of the Killer Tomatoes beats this Rubbish !! The camera work and plot totally lost it!! Sorry I tried being fair I watched until the end (painfully)and still didn't understand why I didn't switch it off earlier Durr !! Hey Horror buff save yer money on this one
1,zombie reject,I love zombie/ undead movies but this movie is bad. the undead souls look to clownish for my liking. this movie put me to sleep. I know GHU are not movie theater releases but come on people you still need to make a worth while film.
3,"Not bad, but not good either !","This movie started off rather good, but then quickly loses itself in an unbelievable story. There's simply no explanation as to why these strange creatures attack the couple. And the whole story seems far too contrived to be believable. The suspense was there at times, but even it couldn't save the movie from falling flat on its face. With all the horror flicks out there, you don't have to get or see this one."
1,LOUSY,"Potentially could have been a great film, but the shaky hand-held camera work made it difficult to watch. The second major problem was that most of the action in the film was in almost complete darkness. It was so dark that you could barely make out anything. What a waste of film. You would have thought after they shot a roll or so of film, they would have realized it was just too dark and would have re-shot that portion and used more light in future shooting. Nope. It never gets any lighter. Could have been a great horror film if you could have seen what was happening. Also the ending was so ambiguous that it was impossible to figure out what actually happened. A complete and total waste of time. Not even as good as Blair Witch Project, which I hated. The costumes, the actors and the locale were all great, but totally wasted."
5,One of the best songs I've heard.,"Not only is Jonathan a great actor, but he's a great singer. I really love this song. It's one of my fav. I haven't gottin his CD, Clash or God Candy yet, but I've heard samplies of the song off Clash which I say are great and I plan to buy it soon. He is Defentilly one of my fav singers."
1,This song bites,I really love Jonathan and I think he's a really great actor but this song is worse than words can express. He sounded as if someone was poking him with a cattle prod while he was recording.
3,Dissapointed,"First of all, my fault was not to see the larger picture and get the detail of what toys were in the set. I received this as a gift and what a surprise, the toys were different from the pics i reviewed after. Besides, my 5month old boy is not very interested in most of them, also, they are heavier considering the set says from birth and plus."
5,A GREAT GIFT FOR A NEW MOM/BABY,"I recieved this box of toys from a friend of mine. The toys were awesome and our daughter used them from the very first toys (rattles) right up to the stacking and linking toys. In fact, her first ""favorite"" toy was part of this set. (spinning rattle) It is a great gift that just goes on giving. They all are very sturdy and durable and I have put them all right back into the sturdy box they came in for the next baby. Recommend it as a great shower gift."
5,Get it all in one box...,"This set is great - it has everything. I received it at my baby shower and really like it, however I now realize that I didn't need it right away. My baby is nearly two months old and is just now starting to focus on objects and follow them with her eyes; she's not even close to being able to really enjoy any of the toys, even though they are simple. If you're on a tight budget, I would say this is not a ""have to have"" before your baby arrives."
4,"Not what's pictured, but still nice","The toys are not all the same as the ones in the above picture, but this still is a very nice assortment. It's great for a shower gift! Some toys are in packages besides the box, and some are just loosely in the box. I wish someone would've gotten me this for my kids when they were infants since we seemed to leave toys everywhere we went and there's plenty in the box!"
3,warning for the babies who are theething,"the toys are cute and great for the baby to play with. the only drawback are the colorful teether toys. when the baby gets few teeth and bites the teether toys, the paint comes off!!!!!!!!!!!! unfortunately, all the teether toys had to be thrown away. babie's safety is more important!!!!"
1,"Injured my baby, paint comes off","My baby was chewing on the buttferfly teether and it cut her gums. She bled and cried for hrs. It was very traumatic for her and I. Also, I noticed the paint easily comes off. I am going to use wash clothes and soft gel teethers only."
3,"Good set, but too many similar toys for infants...","Seems like all the toys are so similar - my children didn't really seem to get much out of them - kind a ""seen one, seen 'em all"" situation. The keys that came in our set were nice as wase the jingle ball. The teething toys were ok, but basic teethers are simpler and seem to fit in our kids mouths better. It costs quite a bit and gives you lots of quantity - but not sure if infants really care all that much. Investing in a few (different) sensory toys seemed to work better for us..."
1,A disappointed Holmes fan,"This can not be a true review as I have not yet been able to finish the book. I loved the 1st 3 books of this series and highly recommend them. In those books, Mr. Millett captured the ""real"" voice of Dr. Watson (as created by Doyle.) This book is all over the place with different points of view -- a street person who catches rats, Shadwell Rafferty, an axiliary character, the author and when we hear about Holmes it's in the awful form of journal entries with initials and ampersands that slow the reading. I intent to try again to finish the book, but think I'll find the next one at the library rather than buying it as I did the first 4, just in case Millett has truly abandoned Holmes in favor of Raffety and is tired of writing in that beloved voice that he was clever enough to re-create when he chose to."
5,Another Winner,"Larry Millett has developed a character who not only rivals Sherlock Holmes, but exceeds him. Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Alliance is the best of an excellent series."
3,"Mildly amusing, well researched but too long winded.","And why does everything in Minnesota have to be so left-wing political?What are the odds of not one, but two, prominent homosexuals in the Twin Cities in the 1890's? Only about 1,000,000 to one.And why the unnecessary jab at the Jesuits?The author obviously projects himself into the role of the protaganist.The book also goes to great lengths to puff up the golden days of newspapers; the author's day job.And here's a question: Does the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle get royalities for the use of Sherlock Holmes character or is it in the public domain? I'm sure the author is a law-abiding citizen who wants to protect property rights of the creative class. No anarchist he.I suppose it will sell in the People's Republic of Minnesota but not much elsewhere."
2,A disapointing book,"I really have to say that I was disapointed with this book. The writing became longwinded and boring, and the story just seemed to drag on and on. Of Millett's four stories, this plot was by far the worst--the whole thing was based on the sexual preferences of two men.The other big problem I have with the Secret Alliance is that it doesn't really involve Holmes at all. The main character is clearly Shadwell Rafferty, which is not exactly what I was expecting. The long portions taken from Watson's diary were added so Millett could call it a Holmes story. The writing from Watson's diary is extremly boring and hard to read, since little of it actually involves the story."
2,Not Millett's Best,"Disappointing. Sherlock Holmes basically disappears from the book - except for the stupid diary form that is practically unreadable - and Shadwell Rafferty does not take the stage. The narration might as well be from a newspaper - no humor, no real way to identify with the characters. He has no alternate narrator to take the place of Watson, and that reduces his usually wonderful book plots to dust."
1,Millett is getting worse and worse,"I enjoyed ""The Red Demon;"" I enjoyed ""The Ice Palace Murders"" much less. I didn't enjoy ""The Secret Alliance."" I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan, not Shadwell Rafferty, and Millett seems to have become infatuated with his own character to the detriment of involving Holmes. If one is going to write Sherlock Holmes stories, then he needs to write Holmes stories, not give him a secondary role to one's own creation. Millett also seems to be increasingly enamoured with his own knowledge of Twin Cities history, and this sometimes gets in the way. We want Holmes, Mr. Millett, not Rafferty, and if you are going to give a leading role to your own creation, then don't try to allure a readership with mostly false claims about a Sherlock Holmes mystery."
2,Sherlock Holmes and the missing character,"How Sherlock Holmes' name can be used in the title with good faith is outside my understanding. I've read all of Millett's ""Holmes"" books, and this story is not only the most tedious, the most uninspiring and the least exciting, it is also the most non-Holmes mystery. We really only experience his presence toward the end of the novel, and then it is still only a shell of the Holmes we've seen from Millett in the past.Shadwell Rafferty is a respectable character, but he is no Holmes. Please, next time just give us a real title like ""Shadwell Rafferty and the Englishmen."" At least that would be fair warning."
2,Secret Alliance Revealed,"The true secret alliance is between the publisher and the author, as they attempt to con and bamboozle the innocent public into thinking that this is a ""Sherlock Holmes"" story. It is not. Not even close. Oh, sure, we're given some badly written ""diary entries"" by Watson, but those are filled with Holmes and Watson pining for Minnesota. Funny how Conan Doyle missed Holmes' deep love for the Midwest.The bulk of the novel is taken up with Millet's own creation, Shadwell Rafferty. Tragically, if this were a ""Shadwell Rafferty"" book, it wouldn't be all that bad. Rafferty is an interesting enough fellow, and the narrative voice used for him is light, but gets the job done. But, then, ""Shadwell Rafferty and the Secret Alliance"" wouldn't sell books, would it?"
2,Disappointing Sequel,"Larry Millett's fourth book is easily the weakest in the series. Holmes and Watson barely make cameo appearances, it's all the annoyingly stereotyped Shadwell Rafferty. The far-left politics don't help either. Millett needs to either research other settings for Holmes and Watson or just give Rafferty his own series so those who can't stand him can avoid him. Having Holmes visit Minnesota once was a stretch, four times is ridiculous."
1,Misleading Title... Shadwhatever whoever and the who cares...,"My sis turned me on to the author, unfortunately this is the first of his books that I've read (only halfway so far, and will probably not finish it.) Now, I'm not sure if I will try any of his others... can I give this zero stars?Obviously my biggest complaint is the same as most other reviewers, the utter lack of Holmes and the horrible way that the diary pages are written. Utterly disappointing."
5,Greatest treat around,"Last year I had coronary bypass surgery and my daughter came to stay with me. She went food shopping and ran across these little gems. She remembered me eating them from when she was a child. Well, now she is hooked on them too. I love the milk and honey the best, and the older the better. I love it when the hard part of the candy becomes soft and the whole thing is chewy. I purchased a box, but the expiration date is 2014. They will be long gone before they get chewy.I can always count on Amazon to have whatever product I am looking for."
3,"Interesting, but nothing great",I am a long time fan of both War of the Worlds and Superman. I have grown up with both. When I saw this book on the shelf (had heard of it before) I bought it thinking it could be an interesting story. What if Superman had been on Earth when it was invaded by H.G's classic Martian tripods.It has some great art drawn in a classic nostalgic style and features some cool Superman moments such as flying a canon up to the hood of a tripod and letting it go off.It even contains a drawing of superman smashing a tipods leg with a car which is a tilt of the hat to the Action Comics cover he first appeared on.All things considered this is a giggle and a mildly interesting read for a fan of either story but nothing amazing.
1,EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY,"I ordered this product because I am a single parent and needed a new full size violin for my daughter that would not break the bank. While the customer service from this company was excellent, the violin was extremely poor quality. It has a very tinny, hollow sound more like nails scratching a chalkboard. It is completely unacceptable for school concert use. It was, in my opinion, a waste of $50.00. It will most likely sit and gather dust in my daughter's closet as I had to go out and spend $550 for a ""real"" violin."
1,Not so solid...,This violin is not really worth what I paid for it. It is made of very cheap material. Didn't even give it to my daughter to play because I thought it would break. Kids instruments should be durable. This is not. I returned the product.
1,Violin sent unfinished!,"My daughter fell in love with the color and the price was right so we purchased it. When it arrived, we realized the bridge was unfinished (no notches for strings, nothing! ) Took it to a musician shop to find out how much it would cost and what else may be wrong with it. There were a number of issues and the cost with new strings was over $100.00 to make it play worthy. A real disappointment, we are returning for refund immediately!"
1,ViolinSmart,A peice of junk. It wasn't made right. The the strings are touching the neck.some of the syrings can not be tuned.
3,It was okay,"Got delivered extremely fast, brilliant timing, but a few of the strings on the bow were broken and its a little difficult to tune because the peg won't turn the strings, sometimes it just turns the peg. I was able to tune it but it took a while. Still, its absolutely gorgeous and great for the price."
1,Garbage,Do not disappoint yourself with this absolute crap. Very cheaply made feels likely to breakdoes not sound right at all.
5,"""Stunning Performance""","Never heard of Kylie until it appeared in my recommendations on Amazon. My musical interests are all over the board but this production was ""over the top"" when it comes to live performances. It is truly ""Vegas"" style and the performance is stunning. The DTS mix is very good considering the venue. The video is excellent. There is an extreme amount of pure energy from beginning to end....the dancers are obviously professional performers and they are amazing to watch...if you like POP music just a little (a bit of disco too)then this is a must have DVD."
3,Kylie Minogue - Live in Sydney,"This is a pretty good concert, but not in the same league as Fever 2002.Well worth owning though, especially to see how much Kylie grew as a performer between this tour and the Fever tour.Very Good."
2,Kylies Girly Show,"Cabaret extraveganza that takes much of it que from Madonna's Girly Show way back in 1993, not a bad effort but i prefer the Girly Show, ironically filmed in Kylies homeland!!"
1,STRANGE AND SHORT,Strange movie and very short in length. I bought it because it had Walton Goggins in it. Strange and violent.
5,Great Diaper Bag,"This backpack diaperbag is great. I got it for my brother as his first daddy gift for his upcoming baby. It is very large. Probable too large as an everyday bag. It would work great for overnight or an all day trip to hold everything. Large enough to hold mom's stuff(wallet, keys, phone,_)There is a handy cell phone pocket on the strap and a place to keep the keys and or some cash. It has plenty of pockets, nice sized changing pad. I havent used it but it appears to be made of very heavy duty material............I was very pleased with the purchase."
3,Nice idea,"It is great that the bag is big, huge in fact. I have enough room for the baby stuff and probably a couple of changes of clothes for me as well. Sometimes I put groceries in it when I run out of room in the basket on my son's stroller.However, the strap on this bag is horrid. Much too long, even a bit long for my husband who is over six feet tall. He isn't skinny either. The adjustments on this bag just leave a lot to be desired.Over all though, it has been helpful, it is a very sturdy bag. And roomy."
1,"5 Months and still no product, but my check was cashed !","I am really upset, because I ordered this product in June and still have not received it after 5 months. I also have emailed this person on 3 separate occasions and have yet to receive an explanation of any kind. They certainly cashed my check immediately and left me holding nothing. I am out $40.00 bucks and definitely mad about it."
5,The Best of both company's cameras,"I bought the Olympus digital for the capability of digital photos and to then have the ability to push a button and have an instant picture develop before my eyes. The 500 film is great, sometimes I wish the printable surface was bigger but. People flock beside me when using the camera and 500 film. Excellent product as I said - the best of 2 camera manufactures!"
3,JA,"The cd arrived in good condition, the cd is nice but I was a bit disappointed with the songs couse i love their 1st cd so much and I thought this one wasnt as good as the first one."
5,Mi amigo bueno! Ahora es mas facil aprender espanol!,"This easy to use dictionary has over 70,000 words and phrases; most dictionaries just give you the definition, this one gives you the common use of the word in a particular phrase. I love the fact that there are examples of idioms and sentences, as well as specialized vocabularies, to include computer/Internet vocab.For the price you just can't beat this handy resource. Truly a guide that will greatly help me learn Spanish for the 21st Century."
3,"Not the best movie, but Anna May Wong is in it.","It boasts a 3 disc special edition, but it's exactly special features. It's 3 movies. It has ""Chu Chin Chow"" and the American cut down version (with less singing) called ""Ali Baba Nights"" and the last disc is a Fritz Kortner movie called ""Abdul the Damned."" I had really hoped it was just ""Chu Chin Chow"" (with maybe the Americanized version) and a lot of fun extras on the production or on Anna May Wong. Like many Wong movies, she's not the main character, but she still does enough to make it a fun movie. Fritz Kortner's performances are rather hammy and silly and he talks very slowly (Capra would have fired him). All in all, you could do worse. I should have gotten the ""Bombs Over Burma""/""Lady from Chungking"" combo pack instead. What I'm really waiting for is an American DVD of ""Shanghai Express."""
1,"Interesting period piece, godawful DVD release","Although this DVD says it's ""digitally remastered,"" that only means that it was transferred from film to the digital medium of DVD. The releasing company missed a golden opportunity to clean it up -- the film is grainy, flickering and shows signs of deterioration that could and should have been corrected before releasing the film on DVD. The soundtrack, as well, is perfectly awful, with shattered, screeching highs and inaudible lows. I have recordings made from wax cylinders recorded before 1910 that have been restored to sound much better than this 1934 release. It's very discouraging that so little care and attention should have been paid to finally making this film available after so many years. Anna May Wong, and the people who buy this DVD, deserve better."
5,Andis Ceramic Edged Blade,This ceramic blade has performed excelently in cutting hair. Andis has taken the use of ceramics as a cutingsurface that much further in technology.
1,Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D,"Older title, not worth installing. Dated grafixs, objective orientated, poor flight controls... Also wouldn't load on my PC with win XP, had to load it on an older PC running win 98SE."
5,Anyone remeber how cool this was?,I sure as heck can't be the only one. The gameplay is not much compared to some of the newer games like Jedi Outcast or KOTOR but it was a wonderful attempt and a lot better than some Lucas Arts games even produced today.
1,Horrible Game.,"What a letdown , I enjoyed the other Rainbow Six games. But Lockdown is Horrible! The enemies are completly stupid . I could stand right in front of them and they would miss me. Graphics are choppy and blurry and muddy .Everything about this game really suxx. I highly recommend never playing this game. The Rainbow Six series was such a solid series , but Lockdown was more of a Letdown for me. Lockdown renamed to ThumbsDown. UBISOFT?? What the hell happened?"
2,Idiotic,"Here is why Rainbow 6 LOCKDOWN is not worth the money; quick and simple1. Its too easy - even on ""Elite"" level, you can push through it, stand in front of people firing at you and nothing happens.2. To unlock levels in multi-player you have to beat them first on single player.3. The guns look like cartoons.Ghost Recon 2 Summit Strike was much much better."
1,They destroyed the series!,"I don't know hwat happened to ubisoft with this game, but it is no a rainbow six game, there are no tactics involved, it isn't realistic at all and has lost its appeal completly. buy it only if you are looking for another underaverage FPS"
1,This game really sucks,"I disagree with the critics. This game sucks. For one, every single time you tell your team to move out to a position, they never regroup no matter how many commands you ordered for them to regroup. Second, there are very few weapons, unlike Rainbow Six Black Arrow. Third, your men can't do anything! They die with a few shots and they hide behind a corner every time you are near a terrorist/mercenary. I highly recommend for you to not buy this game, and go out and buy a great game like Socom 3: U.S. Navy Seals."
1,you can judge a game by it's cover,"The game's cover says it all. Ugly. The worst cover art I've ever seen for a game. Worst of any of the Tom Clancy series for the xbox. An extreme letdown. It should be noted that, if memory serves, Ubisoft Canada team did this one, not the French (but don't quote me on that). Ubisoft promoted this game by claiming ""stunning graphics and ultra-realistic"" which is utter nonsense. A huge step downward in visual quality. Also, this is a minor gripe, but the Rainbow Six team is supposed to be a counter-terror unit I thought, and they seem to be fighting in more warlike theaters and army-like battle grounds. Leave that to the Ghost Recon team folks."
1,Love Willie but Poor quality DVD,"Poor quality, and poor sound DVD. High School students could put together a better quality production. Buy all the Willie stuff you can but stay away from this one."
1,VERY BAD QUALITY,Me and my husband love WILLIE. But this DVD is not worth buying. The sound is very bad. Very poor quality for a DVD. I was very disappointed. Save your money and wait for a better DVD to come along.
3,Beautiful selections...,"The songs on this CD are beautiful when arranged correctly, so it has a wonderful selection. But, the vocals sound strained, flat, especially on the piece ""Noel Nouvelvet"". The instrumentation on ""O' Christmas Tree"" is a little too loud and does not blend well. ""The Seven Joys of Mary"", ""Away in a Manger"", ""O Come Emmanuel"", though, and ""Morning Has Broken"" are gorgeous. This most likely would be a good one to use on the computer, if you edit the playlist. The price is well worth these songs themselves."
4,nice smell and feel,"the trick is to use as little as needed at first, it is rather powerful with a slight tingly sensation. fun for anal"
5,Nice,"I like these connected eye protectors much better than the separate ones. Plus, these came with a nice bag. Quality."
3,Mixed Review,"I found this book somewhat uneven, alternately very interesting and engrossing, yet sometimes boring. I think Haynes does an excellent job of writing about blacks in service and the changing nature of that job over time. He does so without judgment and yet manages to convey how other blacks might look at service positions. I found myself more involved in the passages where successive male relatives discover, are irritated by and ultimately come to love and revere Matilda, than by the passages where Matilda talks herself. All in all however I'm glad that I discovered this author and would be willing to read more of his work."
2,Not Good Enough,Does the job but not good enough. Faults. (1) The bracket that holds it isnot strong enough relative to the weight of the unit. You can fasten it securely but it still wobbles because the steel is not strong enough. Handle it carefully and it works OK. I would not have bought it had I realized that it was so weak. (2) The hose end came off. I had to purchase a hose clamp to hold the hose end on again. Now I have a hose end with an inconvenient clamp around the end of it. This interferes with using the hose and attaching tools to the end of the hose with the quick connect that I use.
3,Love Will Follow - but the rest stayed behind,Agree with previous posts that this album is a commercial overkill. Generally bland except for Love Will Follow which I consider one of the best contemporary jazz songs of all time - considering that it has been remade several times by different jazz artists already. Dave Sanborn contributes with an awesome sax riff while Nathan East thumps his bass straight into your heart! I'm buying this CD here just for this song!
3,The first sign in Kenny's decline through the 80's,"Vox Humana marks a point where it appears as if he was being torn in two. One half of this CD is Five Star while the other half is one. ""Forever"" will go down as one of Kenny's top ten, but the title track is hardly note-worthy. This one is worth the cash, However there are better Loggins CD's out there."
2,Nice Re-Release.... BUT,"... It's a shame that it was not REMASTERED. The whole CD is still at the same levels as the 1985 release.That being said, it's nice to have the two previously unreleased tracks from the Caddyshack S/T on CD for the first time. The production on this album clearly reflects that it is a product from the eighties, but songs like ""Loraine"" ""I'll Be There"" ""Forever"" & ""Love Will Follow"" are really strong.Guess I'll have to buy the album AGAIN when they finally get around to remastering Loggins' catalog."
4,Excellent reference book,"This classic book on superconductivity is excellent for an experienced reader who has already some background in superconductivity. However, for a student trying to learn superconductivity, it says too many things in too brief which may be difficult to follow. While teaching a course I would prefer to follow a book like Superconductivity by Ketterson and Song and refer to this book for selected (special) topics."
4,Size matters,"This bag is great for warmth and room, so if your camping with a car its fantastic...for hiking though its massive, about the same size as youd hope your rucksack might be.....so too big and cumbersome for hiking but a great product other than that"
1,History of California,"I downloaded this book thinking it was a true history of the state. It must have been written by someone from the chamber of commerce or a tourist bureau. It's written for kids in a style that portrays the state as some marvelous fantasy place. I live in California and love it here but I couldn't get past the first chapter. Don't waste you time on this mushy, gushing, piece of trite."
2,It's an OK book to start with....but that's all...,"I bought this book because I had such good luck with Sybex. I got my A+ and Network+ with the Sybex books. But this one fell short....WAY short. I took the test after reading the book and taking the practice exams; and I also took 2 Linux classes (which is a year of Linux) at my school...and FAILED! I got a 570 (you need a 675 to pass). So I studied again for 3 more weeks and took the test for the second time...FAILED AGAIN! None of the questions on the test were covered in this book; this book is a great starter book. But, if you want to pass I recommend that you buy at LEAST one more book. Also I recommend that you download a Linux distrobution and use it everyday for at least 6 months. I'm going to buy another book, and possibly another one after that. Don't underestimate this test...It's WAY harder than the A+ and Network+ put together. Good Luck!"
4,Linux+ Guru,Thank you for your speedy and timely delivery of the book. I have been going through the book and I have been applying what I've been studying. I may not be a Guru now but I will be soon.Ronald
3,Too much profanity.,"I like the program but I think Gordon Ramsay goes overboard with the profanity. To use the ""F"" word from time to time is okay but to use it as much as he does isn't really necessary."
2,not odorless,"The packaging says this shower curtain is odorless, which it is definitely not. I hung it up and immediately heard complaints about the smell. I washed it which improved this problem. Besides that, it is a nice design."
4,Nice shower curtain,"I'm satisfied with this shower curtain, and have received some compliments on it. I followed the other user's comment and added a white liner behind it. I think it looks better that way. Otherwise it's a bit see-through."
4,"Not Bad, but not as good as usual.","Don't mistake with the title. I really enjoy reading this book, but it isn't as good as others Greenwood novels. The plot is great, and it keep you reading the book. It plays with an ancient race that is no longer on Faerun, but in other ""dimension"", and that gives more interest on the book. The treath that they made is very dangerous to Fareun, but Elminster could easilly kill all of them. Thus, Greenwood keep him busy, with the Times of Troubles, the Zentharim, Mystra and all of that. Then, the responsability to save Faerun from the Maulagrym lies in others foes, that make it good :). I enjoy really this book, and it's worth to buy it."
1,Elminster makes this book too annoying to read,"Usually I'm unwholesomely addicted to pulp fantasy novels, but I couldn't stand to read this one. Elminster has to be one of the genre's most annoying characters. It took me more than 1000 pages before I started to hate Drizzit, but only a few dozen for Elminster. In Greenwood's world the most powerful person on Faerun is always cracking bad jokes, winking at his companions, and observing how funny he is. The people around ""El"" are continually groaning and sighing. The novel ends up reading like an unfunny episode of Cheers (the sitcom): cloying atmosphere combined with the impossibility of character development.If you enjoy reading about world-changing events, check out some of the Cyric stories, like _Crucible_ by Troy Denning. Otherwise check out some good FR books by Elaine Cunningham and Paul Kemp."
4,underrated,"Primitive is one of those albums ruined by record company interference.When Neil gave in the original Primitive,Sony didnt hear the middle of the road pop ballads that they think sells Neil Diamond albums.But those added ballads(Turn Around,Sleep With Me Tonight and You Make Me Feel Like Chritmas)completely feel out of place here.Skip the ballads,and you will hear a good (if dated) collection of funky songs about primitive love,space love,Brooklyn street gangs and fire on the tracks."
2,Almost a great album,"This is one of those albums that sits on a fine line between great and terrible. Sadly, it falls on the terrible side. Almost every song on the album is an almost great song that comes up shallow on lyrics. The best examples are ""One By One"" this simple tune almost makes you feel good when you sing along. ""Fire on the Tracks"" lets you down due to a steady fall into Vegas. ""Loves Own Song"" takes on ""Cherry Cherry"" and is thrown for a loss. The albums one saving grace is the title tract ""Primitive."" This could have been a nice single in the late 70's. Too bad the song was released in 1984. ""Turn Around"" is just another failed ballad that Diamond released as a single in that decade. It sounds just like the later ""The Man You Need"" (not a radio single) and ""Turn Around"" from Best Years of Our Lives. The Christmas song? Don't even go there.Neil gets an A for effort with Primitive but, it simply doesn't work."
4,a diamond in the rough,"This album contains the great song ""You Make it Feel Like Christmas""which is the most underated recording by ND. Other tracks are fair to very good, but the aforementioned tune ranks up in the Top 10 of all of Neil's hit singles."
2,Uneven,"Using a variety of producers and studio musicians, this 1984 effort probably represents the low point in the downward spiral Neil Diamond's artistic acreer took after the late 1970's.The problems begin right there with the cover! Again using a ten-year old picture (as on its even weaker predecessor ""Heartlight"") Neil Diamond at the time seemed to have no idea where to go with this album. Some tunes that are quite OK musically (like ""One by One"") suffer from incredibly poor lyrics and vise-versa. The use of different producers doesn't help in giving this effort any profile whatsoever. ""Turn Around"" could've been a great later-day Diamond power ballad but never catches on, ""Fire on the Tracks"" loses steam after the first chorus, and ""Go for the Moon"" or the awkward title track should've been erased from the tapes completely.I saw Neil Diamond on stage a few days after ""Primitive"" was originally released and was incredibly relieved to find that the man had not lost it completely."
1,Not What You Want in a Black Light,"Disappointing all the way around. If you think you will get the white or bright glow from flourescent colors...think again. Illumination is very weak. If you are looking for pet stains...forget it. Not really sure what it's good for, but it might work as a night time heat source in a terrarium...it should do that for you."
3,"Great idea, not enough power","The blacklight bulb is a great idea, but when I put it in a socket it doesn't illuminate much. It's alright if you want to use it in a very small area."
1,Didn't even WORK!,"I bought these for my art classes to display their 'glow in the dark' drawings, but when I put them into the socket they wouldn't even work! I had to rush around trying to find them in the stores I had already looked in... it was a super pain to send them back and start from scratch. Would not recommend this to anyone."
1,stinks,"i was hoping for a black light that filled the whole room or maybe even slightly be able to see a stain or something but no, i wasted my money on this piece of junk. i am not satisfied and DO NOT recommend this"
1,Waste of money,"Thought this would be a decent bulb so i took one in the garage, lights off, and would not give any type of reflection against the brightest white items I have.. Gave off a faint purple color and that was it.. Invest in a pro black light!!"
1,WIMPY!,"Simply put, it does not have anything close to enough power. I purchased two of these 75 watt bulbs for Halloween; to replace the two 60 Watt bulbs I use the rest of the year. A cigarette lighter puts out as much as the two combined."
1,horrible,"don't buy it, it lightens up nothing and barely makes my poster glow.really bad save your money and buy something that will light your room."
3,Fragile item,"Let me say that i don't blame the seller, but the bulb didn't work right when i got it. i should have known better than to order a light bulb through the mail. it lit up, but so dimly that it didn't affect whites even a foot away. it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth following up to get a replacement. like i say, it was most likely rough handling in the delivery process that messed it up."
5,Black light bulb,"This company shipped the product super-well packed and very fast. Glad I didn't pay extra for expedited shipping! It's only good for a small area, but that's what I wanted."
5,Excellent motivation for the soul,"Every CD in the Maranatha Praise Series, regardless of the language, brings inner peace and awakens true love for God. Quiero Alabarte 5 is no exception. And besides bringing such lovely songs, it includes musical tracks that can be used to sing these praises with our own voice to Our Lord."
5,Any college-level holding strong in American or rural history must have this.,"The second updated edition of BORN IN THE COUNTRY: A HISTORY OF RURAL AMERICA remains the only general history of rural America in print, covering changes from pre-Columbian to modern times and blending both agricultural, technological and economic themes with ethnic, cultural and social analysis. This second edition expands the coverage on the late 20th and early 21st centuries and traces changes in country living: any college-level holding strong in American or rural history must have this."
4,A great send-off to a great series!,"This was, I think, the most touching book of the Cazalet series. After the war their situations are not automatically better, but slowly things begin to improve for some of the Cazalets. Clary and Polly fall in love, Rupert and Zoe try to rediscover each other, and Louise makes peace with her past and takes control of her life.For those in the United States who are having a hard time finding this book (as I did) I suggest you try W. H. Smith On-line. I ordered it from them and it took about a month to arrive from England (cost was about 10 pounds)."
4,frustrated reader can't believe vol. 4 is out of stock!,I can't believe this book is out of stock! The end of volume 3 of the Cazalet chronicles leaves you yearning for the final volume (Howard has slowing been increasing the emotional tension with each volume)--and now I'm left in limbo indefinitely! Can't you get some word from the publisher?
4,The Present Emerging,"The Second World War has ended, but ""normal"" eludes most of England and, in particular, the Cazalet family and assorted family retainers, servants, etc. Communication between family members reaches a new low, families break apart and regroup, and faith appears as a real issue. Teddy acquires an American bride of the worst type, Louise sheds a famous husband, Villy becomes the odd one out, Polly does not seek but still finds, Angela travels to the U.S. to marry, Christopher becomes his own man, and Neville is utterly charming in his hideously truthful way. Crawling into the covers of this book gives the reader a real sense of the present emerging. The recorded version sounds magnificent, the dialogue is so skillful that I'd love to listen to the books too. And, having read all four books, must we end it here?"
4,Please don't let this be the last of the saga!,This book had me hoping that this wasn't the end of the line. I wanted the series to go on and on as the Jalna series did.
2,It's an O.K. DVD,It has a lot of info on system of a down but it gets very boring because it doesn't even have system of a down in it and it is only a boring DVD with information and no system of a down music!!!
3,it would be nice to see the people behind the music,good dvd but no inerviews with the bands itself strange its unauthorized so i would suggest getting an autorized verion instead one where they actually talk to the band memebers and no music common we need that to there must be a better dvd out there i tried to give it 2 starts btw but it wouldnt let me
1,Unauthorized,"2002Since forming in 1995, Los Angeles foursome System of a Down have built a massive following for their hybrid of explosive rap-matal, punk, funk and incendiary lyrics. Having cut their teeth supporting the likes of Slayer, Sepultura, Korn, Metallica and Kid Rock, they now habitually pack stadiums with their own headlining shows! System of a Down: Psycho Messiahs is the first-ever biographical film about this uniquely innovative band. With a running time in excess of 60 minutes, it uses extensive band interviews and in-depth discussions with those closest to them, to tell the complete & unauthorized story behind the music.This is NOT what you think your buying......"
1,Entertaining? . . .ummm . . .,"If you are an EXTREME SYSTEM fan and you MUST own EVERYTHING that has the words ""SYSTEM OF A DOWN"" on it. . . then buy this just to add your collection. This isn't the greatest DVD ever, but it has some awesome pictures on it. This is the kind of thing you have playing on the TV (with it muted of course, system never once speaks , it's just some english lady who can't even pronounce their names) and just basically a background filler.So to make a long story short if you are not a PYSCHO system fan, don't bother."
1,Yawn...,"This is absolutely the worst $25.99 I have EVER spent on something about one of my favorite bands. As one user stated, Don't buy it if it says ""Unauthorized."" There are no interviews with the band, No performances, and overall, it's just a ripoff. AVOID."
4,Fantastic,This was a sweet Dvd that was loaded with tons of info that not a lot of people would know but it had no interviews with the band themselves
5,Great book,"Most books worth reading are no longer in print and this certainly can be said here.Harold L. Peterson establishes himself as the great historian of the times with this work in which he details how the fighting men who are responcible for this country's founding were: armed, equipped,clothed, organized and supplied.He details everything, from the cloths they wore to the packs on their backs and the canteens on their sides.This book is one that should be put back into print and made more available for reading.A great refurence to the soldiers of the period."
1,It is oh so so British ....,One of the first books I have read by this author in the Black Lace series and I have to admit that she spent so much time in trying to make the story tie together that the eroticism and sex actually suffers ....Our heroine is hard to figure and as the reader I felt rather ambivalent as miss daddy rich bucks tries to fit into the London media scene. The fact that her daddy bought out the publishing empire where Annabelle was working practivcally wanted to make me vomit ....Sorry just doen't cut it for me ....
3,Have not received this item yet,"Pastor Hick, as I have written before, is excellent. But, I haven't receive this book yet to measure it up to what the grat pastor has written before"
1,PLEASE....Pull up your ANCHOR!,"While the book is filled with its ""cute"" moments, I can't get past the author to enjoy the book. All I have to say to you is learn about the author before you read the book. The ""H"" for H. Beecher Hicks does not stand for HUMILITY or HONESTY. Besides, Maya Angelou did not co-author this book as the presentaiton would suggest. She merely contributed the foreward."
3,Like the plug-and-play feature; functional but basic,"I'm so glad that this player is about as un-like the all-too-popular iPod in the sense that it takes a regular battery (no need to charge using a computer), it is a plug-and-play USB (no cable to lose), and can be synced using Windows Media Player, so there's no need to download iTunes.However, I wish that there was a way to order the tracks on this player. There isn't, so the songs go on in random places. That is friggin' annoying when you just want to listen to a particular song. I don't recommend using this as your primary mp3 player if you want an iPod-type player, but if you just need music in the background, this will work. Also, this player only holds about 125 songs, so you will find yourself deleting a song every time you add one.Edit: I feel obligated to add that my brother got two of these for his kids and claimed that they stopped working after a few months; however, I have had mine for a year and it still works the same."
3,colby player,This is a good product. I bought three of them but one would not work. Amazon was great about replacing it when I called. Does not hold a ton of songs but works fine for my purposes
2,You get what you pay for.,"Loading songs onto the player was hit and miss. After using my player for two weeks, it developed a short of sorts, where turning it on and off was time-consuming. Also, what I thought was a short in my earphones turned out to be a problem with the player. Now, it won't load songs at all.I gotta check the warranty on this thing."
4,gave this to a friend and my kid,both of them love it. it's simple so not much to go wrong. good deal for the money.
3,Alright,"This is pretty good for the price. I like the variety of options, but the clear cover doesn't exactly match up with the click wheel, which is a bit frustrating."
5,Dragons & Dreams by Tom Fuller,I highly recommend this CD by new artist Tom Fuller. His lyrics are soft and touching. I felt like he was singing to me alone. What a sweet experience.
3,Too Hot,"I like Shannon McKennas books on the whole, although they can get a bit bogged down with the very explicit sex scenes. Her books are now starting to become set in the way that they are written so you know before hand what is going to happen. Tend to skip parts of the sex scenes as there are too many. I like hot sauce in my books but too much......"
2,Did not really like this one...,"First, let me say I read another story in ""Bad Boys Next Exit"" book from her called ""Meltdown"" and that was a great story...I really enjoyed everything about that one..and I thought this book would be as good as that one but it started off ok but it was so boring and Simon was so whiny and Ellen was so desperate to keep him. I was very disappointed with this book. Of course, as usual, the sex scenes were steamy and it started off with a good plot..and some other scenes were good.but overall, Ellen was portrayed as so needy for Simon, and Simon was so annoying...I just wanted to smack him..Every time he would be with Ellen for too long, it was like, ""oh, i am not good enough for you"" and then Ellen would have to beg him, sleep with him, yell at him...ugh! I was so frustrated with that...It was like, get over yourself already! I was not impressed with this book at all...i hope the other ones are definitely better."
2,Not a fan,"I purchased this book to try out a new author, but I must say I am not a fan if this is a typical example of her work.What a whiney, pathetic, emotional wreck this ""Alpha male hero"" is. Why would anyone put up with being treated like that!The heroine is not much better - she is successful, independant, knows what she wants and yet keeps coming back for more. I am sorry I ordered more of this authors books before I had sampled this one. In my opinion there was not much substance to the story, the plot was flakey, the characters were entirely unbeliveable and the whole book did not make much sense."
1,Total Waste of Money and Time,"I was very disappointed in this book, it read like it was agraphic sex novel instead of mystery/romance. Totally unseemlyin my opinion. Crude language and there was a little suspencein the story line, however, it was overshadowed by explicitsex descriptions.Actually, I felt the mystery was a weak one,and felt like 100 pages of this book was just crap. Nothingread smoothly, and the characters lacked depth, although we didn't really get to read much about them, so maybe that isn'tan adequate characterization.In my opinion, I'm seething, because I wasted my money.!I have read other books by McKenna, but didn't expect this."
5,vent free heater,"Bought a home with an OLD wall unit. tore it out and replaced it with this kozy world heater...LOVE IT..easy to install, can turn on one grate or all..works wells. Shipped and packaged well..."
5,Great Heater!!,Really GREAT Heater !!! Came as stated brand new in box only bad thing wish I would have bought one with the blower but I put a fan by it (I have a huge house ) This heater heats my whole house !!! Great Buy !!!!
1,does not work,"Not only is heater made chintzy, it does not work. I'll be sending this back for a refund. Replaced already with a store brand.I wish I could have given this zero stars."
3,Warn cover,"The cover is nice, but I wish it was made out of something more durable... like nylon. I have had it about 6-8 months now and its starting to show its wear already. It works like it should but I have a feeling by the end of next summer it will be finished and i'll be picking another one up. I would say its needed for people who picked up a Warn winch with the synthetic rope. If I had the steel cable I dont think I would bother."
3,"Nice Video, but Audio?","Product reviewed well in PC magazine, and installed easily on my IBM laptop - very nice display of 16 channels (still shots) at a pop, video really pretty good after tuning each one...but you thought perhaps you'd get AUDIO piped along with it? Well, think again. I suppose somewhere in the specs it says your laptop needs to have a line input (3.5 mm stereo jack in) but I missed it. Line input means relatively high voltage (up to volts) while the microphone input (usually mono) wants millivolts so be careful. If I were using a desktop with a sound card (which have line inputs generally) I'd give this thing 4 stars. There is no, NO online support - the product manual is not on the CD and the link to it on the website is dead. So I can see fine, and I can hear fine if I bring headphones. You can record video but in my case, not audio."
1,horrible support - they unkown your own products,I have talked with support guy if ULTRATV USB 300 TV Tuner works with PAL-M systems and the answer was YES. Then because this information I purchase the device. BUT when I receive it doesn't work... ;) and they dont want do nothing about this... unbelievable!!! Is not a serious company...
5,Who loves Gitans and Flamenco should listen to this CD,"This music is a mixture of Flamenco, Arab and indian rythmes. It is extremely beautiful."
2,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,I bought this item and used it 2 or 3 times before it started developing small pin size holes in the corner of the seams. We have used all of the patches the bed came with and it seem everytime we patch one hole you inflate the bed and find 2 more! This was not worth the $189 Target charged me for the bed. I have a $25 mattres from Walmart we have used many times that still works great! Please don't waste your money!
2,"Great start, sad finish","When I first purchased this bed and began to use it, I loved it. However, after only about a month of use it began to develop holes and became useless, even after several repair attempts. Don't waste your money."
3,worst R6 of the series,"plagued by crappy enemy AND teammate AI, some terrorists dont go down even after littering their bodies with bullets. this rainbow six isnt nearly as realistic as the previous titles. even if you're a fan of the series like myself, you will be disapointed with this. a $30 pricetag isn't all that bad however so buy at your discretion. it is a fun action game however but too easy."
2,Lockdown should be a word to describe the errors,"Rainbow 6 Lockdown is a big upset from the previous, more realistic version 3. The errors will anger you greatly, especially your team mates shooting you in the back. Rainbow team is supposed to be the most skilled operators on the planet and yet the gameplay lacks the simplest qualities of controlling negligent fire. Also be sure to run quickly through areas to stop the bad guys from constantly engaging. Multiplayer is not as good as the previous 3 and again the game is rife with errors like bad guys shooting you through solid metal hulls and having to take ten rounds in the chest to drop. Your team mates will also fail to follow commands and fail to kill enemies two feet away! Overall a poor follow up in the Rainbow Six series. It's obvious the tech's at Ubisoft threw this one together to make a fast buck."
1,Rainbow sucks,if we compare it to the previous this game sucks...your team only helps you to fail..its not like Ghost Recon or Rainbow 6.... rent it first and if you like it then buy it ....
4,Good PS2 Shooter,"Overall this is a good game. The multiplayer is very fun and I enjoyed the sniper missions. It had a creative plot and the graphics are not mind blowing, but they are decent for the PS2."
1,not very good...,"i liked the last rainbow six for the ps2, but i rented this one and i would suggest you do the same. right from the beginning it's average at best and not a lot of fun. the controls are especially wack and will mess you up constantly.avoid"
1,A huge sell out - I'd rather die than play this game again,"Ubisoft need their heads examined. Everything that was great about previous versions of Rainbow Six got thrown out the window when they did this game. Everything is dumbed down to make this about as realistic as Sonic the Hedgehog. If you don't already own it, spend your cash on the previous title (""Black Arrow"") instead.Buying this game is actually morally wrong - it supports the dumbing down of entertainment in pursuit of profit. In fact you might say that buying this game is a lot like giving into terrorism."
3,Lousy Product,Product fails to deliver expected service. Used exclusively for egg work and sauteing the blade warps and blisters. I do not recommend the product.
3,A bit deceiving...,"Just received it and it is small and too flexible. I will try it later and see how it holds up.It should be more rigid. It gives the impression that I won't be able to turn a pancake or even an egg.When I try it, I will update the review but so far, that's my first impression."
2,"Misleading, disappointed","The description clearly states that the product is heat resistant to 450 degrees F, but on the back of the handle it reads ""heat resistant to 410 degrees F. As other reviewers have said, it is flexible and small, which is fine. So, it would be very nice if I weren't looking for something more heat-resistant."
1,Save your money...,"The material used to make this spatula seems of good quality, but the design is poor.The blade is floppy and flimsy - ok for shuttling frozen french fries off a baking pan, but it's no match for anything that's sticking. It sags under heavier foods, and tends to drop its load just before you reach the plate. Fewer holes/more material would solve the problem.The handle is rigid enough, but it's molded in a hollow ""u"" shape that is a bit uncomfortable to use.I would return this item, but it's not worth the hassle."
1,"""High Heat"" is a matter of opinion","We have used Berndes pans in our kitchen for nearly a decade. When our Berndes flat spatula finally gave out, we ordered this one, thinking that it was a direct replacement. It ain't. Not even close. The first time we grilled cheese on bread, the tip of the spatula started melting and curling. Again, we're not talking a lot of heat here. Each time after that, we found ourselves peeling away layers after layers from the tip and shortly higher up, we gave up and threw it out.Norpro is a cool brand name. Cheapro would be closer to ""truth in advertising."""
1,Disappointed...flimsy,"I ordered two of these because I like small spatulas. It's the size I like, but it is very flimsy and it has melted some. It's hard to pick up some foods with it. Added this July 18, 2011: One spatula is now totally broken in half."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I thought I had found a steal - a car adapter, case and earbuds all in one box for $15. I figured it was a good deal, so I bought the same thing for my friend (for her i730).What a rip...the case won't allow my phone to close fully and the car adapter won't even connect to my phone. It's the right 'fit' and all...but it won't attach on one end. It's obviously cheaply made and...well...I got what I paid for...a piece of junk."
4,FUN that grows on you . . .,"This was the first Avett Brothers CD that I heard. I have never seen them live (although I will - in 2 weeks! can't wait!) I admit, there are times on this recording when they are pretty out of tune, and they are more yelling instead of singing. And the sound quality of the last couple songs is pretty bad. BUT, the sheer joy of playing for their fans came across so powerfully, and their raw energy just burst out of my speakers - and I was totally struck down with Avett Brothers fever. I have played this one ALOT. It's not for everyone, but if you want to take a chance on a ""punk band with banjoes"" give it a listen."
5,Excellent CD/terrific band,"This album is a terrific way to get a taste of a high energy live Avett Brothers performance (the best way to enjoy them). These guys put together rock, bluegrass, balads and punk - delightful."
3,Not the best set of headphones,"The Koss TD60 headphones are not the best ever made. The main reason is that they're heavy and after you wear them for a couple of hours, your ears will be sore around the edges because of the way they're padded and the weight of them. The sound is pretty good, but if you like listening to music like me, don't wear the TD60 more than a couple of hours at the most or you might not be able to use headphones for a few days. Then again, there are a set of ear plugs included. I haven't used them yet and I'm not crazy about ear plugs but with these headphones, I might have to.The sound quality isn't the best but it's good enough with the Koss TD60, but the headphones are not comfortable after you wear them awhile. That's the bottom line. There are better sets of headphones out there that you can buy."
2,Small Sound for Heavy headphones,"The Koss TD-60 Headphones are heavy, and uncomfortable to wear, which detracts from the enjoyment of listening to music. The padded earpieces cause your ears to sweat and they become very uncomfortable, plus the sound is quite Small and Tiny. Not top quality headphones, even for the price. There are much better products out there in this price range."
5,Myst IV,"This game is extremely well adapted to xbox. Beside the nice possibilities to move it has a help-function where it is possible to chose between ""hints"" and a full solution. The help-function also contains maps of all the ages of Myst IV helping to move around. Myst IV is not an easy to play game, I would only recommend that game for people being fond of solving puzzles (difficult and extremely difficult ones). Also some puzzles contain to bring codes, others are not straight foreward. Therefore just for the really really fond of puzzle gamers. Besides that, wonderfull environments are always a great joy in Myst (I never encountered such nice environments in other games), and the movement possibilities of 360 degree and up and down viewing is adding to this joy."
4,Great Continuation,"I had only played the original trilogy, but I've enjoyed this one. My only criticism is that it's a bit limited on environments compared to Riven and Exile. There's only four major areas here, but they seem very small."
3,NOT Compatible with Xbox 360-80s Gamer is wrong,"From the dialogs in the prior reviews, I had come to the conclusion that if I had a Microsoft HDD in my Xbox 360 S Kinect, then this game would work. Turns out that it still does not work. 80s Gamer must be confused. Myst III works after some frustrating moments reformatting things but Myst IV is a no go on the Xbox 360 so if you are buying this with play on an Xbox 360 in mind you are wasting your money. You have been warned. I gave the game 3 stars because I have no idea if I like it or not and that is middle of the road."
3,Fair,"The game seems difficult for the Xbox to process. While the game is new, I get dirty disk error messages and other games work in the console with no incidents. I have read other reviews about this, but when the game works it is very fun to play."
2,Not compatible with Xbox 360 UNLESS....,"Very disappointed! I'm sure the game is a blast, but it IS NOT compatible with the new Xbox 360 unless you have a hard drive attached to it. I read one review that said it was compatible, I thought I was in the clear. My Xbox is the version that came boxed with Kinect. Now that it is open it is un-returnable AND un-playable. Totally bummed. Anyone want to buy this off me??"
4,Classic Wayne,Who can't use more John Wayne. I grew up watching Rio Grande and the Fighting Kentuckian as a child. It's great to have these movies together
2,OK i guess... NOT,if you have know idea about medicine dont buy this game. Even if you know some dont buy it only buy this if you are a doctor or studying to be a doctor. One of the bad things is that even if u figure out how to use the instruments the game ends in 20 minutes i returned it right after and got a new game DONT BUY THIS GAME
1,Do not waste your money!,"O.k. This is another one of those deceptive DVD's. You think that there will be interaction between the ""Sorority Girls"" but in reality what you get are 6 single ten minute nude portfolios of average looking women. The DVD could have been called ""Tepid, desperate women looking for employment."" No relation to sororities at all. The women are o.k. looking - some with tattoos, some with piercings, and the photography is fine - more explicit than Playboy, less explicit than Penthouse. Bottom line = very, very boring. You've been warned. Don't make the mistake I did. Save your $15.00 on something else."
1,Bought it for my kids,"The music was lame and the video had different images flashing in front of you. It made you a little sea sick. My kids were disappointed by it too. We expected more. There were some neat tricks and not a lot of profanity, but overall I recommend Revelation 199 or The X games."
3,expected more,"I bought this for my husband as a gift and watched it with him. I really thought there would be more to it. Its all watching people ride with background music... The only cool thing about it was the interview with Travis pastrana, James Stewart and Ricky Carmichael."
3,"Great tool, but FULL of errors!","Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying this book, but the overwhelming number of errors in this book is staggering and inexcusable, especially since all of the formulas and most of the problems should just be cut-n-paste from various respected sources. It's frustrating not knowing if your getting a practice problem wrong because you're doing it wrong or because the book has the wrong formulas, problem wording, problem answers, etc.Even the online errata list only covers a portion of the errors."
3,"Wry, Witty, Entertaining","Gwen Zepeda's collection of short stories in ""To The Last Man I Slept With and All The Jerks Just Like Him"" was interesting, wry, witty and entertaining...just like Gwen. I first heard Gwen perform a reading of her stories at a Nuestra Palabra showcase in Houston, TX and immediately appreciated her sense of humor. If you want to get a feel for her work, visit her website at http://www.gwenworld.com. Her website is just as funny if not funnier than her book! I hope she reads for Nuestra Palabra again! (www.nuestrapalabra.org)"
5,Amazing!,"wow, i really loved this DVD. i cant wait for the second one to come out! ryoko is a great fighter and i cant wait to see what happens to her. i definetly recommend it"
3,Overdone,"Although I think that the story behind it is a good idea, I also think they could have done it better. At times (which is almost everytime they show Ryoko) the whole ""I'm a samurai"" thing can be overdone, and, most times, irritatingly annoying. The series has great potential but they just barely missed pulling it off."
2,Low quality...,"This is exactly the type of album that gives progressive rock a bad name; it's trite, over-bearing and dull. There's no doubt that these are skilled musicians, but the songwriting is painfully dreary and uninspired. On top of it all, the production is just awful, turning the band's already insipid music into a somber mass of sound that simply fails to move.It's a shame that bands like Cast or Iconoclasta have become Mexico's main exports in progressive rock, and I'd discourage anyone but a true fan of rare and relatively unknown prog from buying anything by this less than stellar band."
3,In the 1930s con-men who hold fake seances to ...,"[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]... rip off grieving rich people uncover a bizarre plot involving eugenics. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
4,An excellent story full of great characters set in a wonderfully constructed world (my endorsement)...,"Girl in the Glass drew me in from the first paragraph and kept me engrossed till the end. Few novels of late can boast of doing the same with me. Jeffrey Ford not only creates/recreates a time period and a very distinctive subculture, he tells one heck of a story utilizing this setting.Every character in this book comes to life. Antony in particular is a character that will live for a long time in my memory. I sometimes find myself in situations where I would not mind having an Antony handy.The butterfly motif here would shame even Nabakov.All in all, I find myself not wanting to say too much to ruin this book for you. I will say this--you should read Girl in the Glass. You will not be disappointed.I give this book a full recommendation."
2,"Addictive one day, forgettable the next ..........","She has a very sweet voice, but despite being in the biz for a while now, the voice still lacks strength. With movie roles taking over, maybe that won't matter."
4,ok,I would have liked to know that there was highlighter marks in the book. I would've bought one that didn't. This should be disclosed in the description of the condition of the books in the future. Otherwise book was fine.
5,amazon review,The book arrived sooner than expected abd was given as a gift. the receipient was very pleased. I have been very pleased with every order I have received from Amazon.
3,Whatever works...,This is good material. A 90's artist with a 70's feel. But isn't it a little egomaniacal to think that no one else is qualified to play it with him on the recording? Check your ego at the door and maybe someone will listen.
4,Internationally loose connection,"This device works. But not too well. The connector seems to easily wiggle out of place, losing contact with the Palm. So you need to make sure the little PalmOS light is ON after you connected the plug and set the Palm on the table.After that, the Palm charges fast and this 'kit' comes with a bag and all the plugs to work in Asia or Europe."
3,"Good, but misjudged usage criteria.","I bought this to use as a continual charger because I use my Palm for long periods of time. It worked for awhile, then the wire seemed to get bent and I have to tape it on and bend the wire and tape somemore. A big bummer when I need to HotSync and then want to use it away from the cradle. My misjudgement, but I expected it to be tougher. Otherwise I really like the convenience and am buying another ... will use it more wisely this time!!"
3,Is this item compatible with the Tungsten E?,Before I order this item I would like to confirm that this item is compatible with the Tungsten E? Thanks!
1,Lousy,It quit charging after several weeks usage. Amazon will allow returns only for 30 days. Don't waste your money.
3,Mothers Little helper,"Victoria is spending time in a beach house,having scored a job as a mothers-helper.Between taking care of two lively kids,she is chasing after a major jerk and trying not to laugh when another boy insists that he loves her and they belong together.Warning;This isn't for pre-teens as it includes one piece of risque content.(and I don't mean the nudey beach.)"
4,I know what this girl is going through!!,This book was really a good book. It describes what can go through the mind of a teenage girl in love with a boy. Something i can relate too. It also can open your mind with the out comes that may happen and warn you to be careful!! Maybe who liked isnt who you really want to be with.
1,Don&#65533;t Disappoint Your Kids,"My 7-year-old son and his friends were anxiously waiting for my husband to set up the slide. My husband said that it was very easy to set up, but as soon as he hooked up the hose to the nozzle so the water could shoot out, the liner popped. This all happened before anyone had a chance to slide down it.He then had to take it all down and get it ready to take it back. My son sat there on the ground staring at the box with tears in his eyes. It was very heart breaking. My husband brought it back to get a replacement, but they were all sold out. We did get a full refund.We searched all the stores that carry this slide and found they too were out of stock. Now I know why. Everyone else is having the same problems.Great concept - very poor quality."
2,Too much to pay for a toy that lasts a year,"This slide was great fun for one season. When we got it out a couple of weeks ago, it wouldn't hold air...seems to be leaking at all the seams. Buy this with caution, as long as you know this will last for one year!"
5,HAD TO RETURN IT,"We all loved playing with this toy, but after only 3 hours of play, the hose was the first to split, then the seems started tearing one after the other. I was going to return and get another but after reading the reviews, my story is common. I think I will buy something else (...). My children are now devastated. Great fun , lousy durability. What a shame!"
1,Great while it lasts......,"I bought one of these last summer. The kids (ages 3 and 6) LOVED it! But...you will only get one summer of use out of it. The material deteriorates/dry rots pretty quickly. It's now going to the garbage can....unfortunately, I can't afford to buy one of these every summer, no matter how much the kids like it.Incidentally, two other families on my street bought the same product, and had the exact same problem we did.So....it's a lot of fun while it lasts, but it's a real shame the manufacturer can't construct it of more durable material."
2,banzai falls,My kids and the neighborhood kids all loved the slide however the seams blew out after 1 season and now it is going in the trash. This product is not made to last!!
4,An Expensive Bust,We enjoyed this toy for the total of 5 hours that it lasted - then the hose seam burst. When we returned it to the store we were told that ours was the 5th or 6th one to be returned with that particular defect. With that bit of information we saw no need to replace it. My daughter was heartbroken but it's just too much money to gamble.
5,What a disappointment,"I searched for days for this item. When I finally did bring it home i set it up and as with everyone else it ripped at the seams. I have been trying to contact the company for about two weeks with no response. Very disappointing. The children just want to play and I can't even get an answer from the company. Very poor customer service. You would think that with the cost of this item and the fact that it was poorly made, they would at least take the time to contact people regarding what they will do to replace the item."
1,Talk about SUCKS!!!,Same old story. I bought the basic slide on 6/12/08 for almost $300. We used it probably 7-10 times last summer. I went to put it up today (7/11/09) and it was way too soft to use. I finally found where it was losing air. When I held that area up to the light I could see a 14 X 2 inch strip where the inner lining came apart from the outer. Now I find out that the warranty is only 60 days. Shame on me for not knowing but a big shame on this company for selling this crap.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,MADE IN CHINA MADE IT CHEAP,"This is a fun toy for about 10 minutes, while the seems started ripping off. My daughter almos suffocated on it. The slide tear up and my daughter got cut in the middle of the of it. It is a danger to the children. When you call customer service it takes them abot 45 minutes to answer and the the way to fix the problem is sending you a replacement of another slide. They won't refund your money. If you purchase one and you open it TOY R US will not refund your money they will send you through the distributer in Nebraska. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS ITEM TO NO KIDS, it will cause a lot of headaches trying to get your money back. I write this because I tried with a replacement they WILL send and same thing as the first one. PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN.I GOT TWO and both were the same problem."
4,Kids LOVE it.,"My kids adore this water slide. We have had it for the past two summers. When it gets blown up, the neighborhood kids flock to it. Our rules are:1. One person on the slide at a time.2. Wait until the person in front of you has slide to the bottom before climbing to the top to take your turn.3. No pushing or shoving. No jumping from the top.It has provided a tremendous amount of fun for the children for the past two summers, but is now showing a large amount of wear and tear. The bottom/slide is squishy. The seams are gapping. The place where you climb has gone soft. I think after this summer is over, it will be retired to the dumpster.Even so, it is cheaper than a water park pass (with parking, food, etc) for the entire family for one day and the kids use it over and over. Knowing what I know now, we would still have purchased it.It is almost the end of July 2008, and I am looking now for end of season sales on an upgraded, newer, bigger, better version for next year."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!,"I bought 3 that is right 3 because i had to return the first one when the water line that connects to the hose broke, then the second one because the blower did not turn on - and finnally the last return was after 45 minutes when the seams in the steps going up the back torn out & caused it to no thold air - not a good thing!!! THIS WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY & THEY ARE ALL OVER EBAY for a LOT MORE THEN $300.00 but you have to be very careful with them!!!!!! don't turn the water up and do NOT let more then one person on the slide at ANY TIME!!! then maybe it will last!"
1,Slide of Broken Bones !!!!!!!!!!!,"On Sunday, June 4, 2006 in the evening my [...] niece and her friend were sliding down the Banzai Falls Slide when the bumper stop at the end of the pool area snapped loosed and she went flying in the air and landed on the ground so hard that it shattered her left forearm. Today Thursday, June 8, 2006 she has to have surgery to have a plate put in her arm. This is NOT FAIR for an [...] child or any child to go through just for a NO GOOD PIECE OF JUNK SLIDE."
1,a bum deal,i bought the six flag banzai fall mega racer in april and today the slide now after only about 2 months it will not hold air enough to enjoy it. my grandchildren only use it when they come to visit. when they do come back over they will be devastated.they only visit weekends it is a shame. it seems like some parts have wore very thin and the middle will not even inflate watch out consumers
2,Great fun...but doesn't last long.,"We got this slide from a neighbor who only used it one time. It was in perfect condition when she gave it to me. I used it for my children's birthday parties in May & in June. After using it about 10 times it is about on it's last leg. The stitching is pulling out on the sides of the slide and are getting so large I'm sure it won't be holding air for much longer.My kids and their friends had a great time playing on this slide. No doubt about it - it is fun! But way too expensive for a toy that only lasts one summer. Glad I didn't actually pay for it!Also, I did get someone on the helpline (after waiting almost 45 minutes on hold). I was told I could just use a needle and thread and sew any seams that appear to be coming apart, or I could use the repair kit that came with the slide. Obviously not very helpful.Great fun if you have extra money laying around and don't mind throwing it away."
1,Fun for a day...,"Due to the number of reviews on this product, I'll spare you the long version and give you the readers digest version.This water slide is loads of fun, easy to set up, and is an instant hit with the kids. The problem is...the seams rip within a short period of time and then it won't hold enough air for anyone to climb up on the thing. The joy of the thing leaves just as quickly as it came. Count yourself lucky if you can get it to last one summer. We were only able to get a week out of our before the seams ripped."
1,Combine complaints into a Class Action Lawsuit against mfr.,I too have been dupped! We purchased & used our slide for one summer & took very good care of it. This summer it won't hold enough air to slide down. This is such a scam. Tried to contact mfg about problem also - no answer.I have read all of the reviews - I wish I could have read them before I purchased the item.HAS ANYONE HAD ANY LUCK GETTING A HOLD OF THE MANUFACTURER? HAS ANYONE HAD ANY LUCK REPAIRING THEIR SLIDE OR HAVING IT REPAIRED BY A STORE?I can't believe that the company has not recalled these units - just because there are hundred of complaints & all for the same problem!I bet if your local newspaper or television news reporters would cover a story of this magnitude. I'm going to call mine & I will print out these reviews to show that there are others that have also been DUPPED!
2,great slide but doesn't hold up!!,"I loved the idea about this ""waterslide"" I set it up and the kids ages 9 and 4 used it for about 15 mins and the seam on the side broke open? So i taped it so they could use it but for $299. i was going to get more than 15 mins of use. I brought it back traded it for another one and when i was unrolling it there was a small hole in the side. So i taped that the kids went down it once and the same thing happened with the seams. I brought that one back and the mangager at the store said he had about 10 brought back because of this problem. I hope they can reinforce the seams because i will but another one!!!TinaLittleton, NH"
2,Fun while it lasted,"My husband and I bought this for my girl's 7 year old birthday party. The first day, same problem as the others, the water hose seam ruptured. We then returned it for another one and now the seams from the foot steps have ripped, allowing the air to come out. We are very disappointed on the quality and durability of this product. I hope your new re-designed slide will be worth buying. Also, I would like to mention to the manufacturer, that the pool area, in which the children fall into, should be made a little more longer (3 or 4 ft.)because when my two kids come down the slide they sometimes would fall over which can be dangerous. If these complaints are perfected I would consider buying another slide."
1,Was it worth the money!?,It was great.....or at least we thought.Within 30 min. it popped!!!!As it popped it fell over while me and my brother were on it.I fell off and landed on my arm and my brother landed on his back.We went to the hospital and I broke my arm and my brother almost died from landing on his back!!!We tryed to return the slide but they would not take it back because it broke!I spent a year saving that money and lost it all.This was the worst toy I ever bought.It broke my leag and wasted $300!!!!What a waste!
4,SOOOOOOOOOOO much fun,i just got this slide yeastarday for my 4year old son we had tons of people at our house ranging from 4-34 everybody had a blast the only bad thing is where the water hose connects got twisted and poped so the water will not spray like it should but i plan to get another one (if i can find one since everybody is soldout) easy to put up and take down ever comes with a bag to store it in. it was great and e-z
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"We bought this slide, thinking it would be really cool and fun. Well we got it and we set it up, it broke. The piece where you put the hose in broke, as soon as we turned on the water it sliced open. So I called the manufacturer and they said they know a lot of people are having the same problem. They will not have anymore until August. Hopefully they will be fixed by then. Anyway don't waste your money."
5,DONT DISSAPOINT YOUR KIDS,"Today my husband and I bought the banzi slide. Just like all the other review we thought it was great. When we set the slide up and put the hose, in the nozzle part so the water could shoot out, the liner poped, but we deceided to keep it anyways. After a couple hours of playing on it, My kids who are 6 & 9, the seams at the bottom of the pool part popped. My kids were very dissapointed, about this. This product is alot of fun, but the quality of it is very poorly. Dont dissapoint your kids and buy this product. Waste of time trying to find it and waste of time taking it back."
1,will only last for one summer.,"This water slide was fun for my children, but before the hot days of Georgia heat was over I had problems. Where the water hose go to the slide, that would not hold any more and I had to patch a hold where the children get off the slide. When using the patchs that came with the slide, it would only last for two or three days.If you think this item is going to last for 2 or 3 summers, think twice."
3,its okay,Did not last that long. First one lasted 4 years or more this one lasted maybe 2 years. just ok
2,lasted only one season,"GREAT SLIDE KIDS HAD A GREAT TIME ON IT. USED IT A FEW TIMES, TOOK IT OUT AGAIN AND THE SLIDE WOULD NOT HOLD AIR. TOO EXPENSIVE OF A SLIDE TO ONLY LAST ONE SEASON. MOST OF THE SLIDE IS MADE OF DURABLE MATERIAL. TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE IS A THIN MATERIAL, I BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THE AIR IS LEAKING."
3,only good for one year tops!,this toy was the rage in our neighborhood last June when we purchased it. easy to set up and lots of fun. we followed the instructions and let it dry than folded it away for a long winters nap- well it came out in april and it seemed like even with a little water in it the bottom would sink down. finally we figured out why- all the plastic underneath had dry rotted out. its unsafe now for even one kid to climb up. Im so disappointed with the quality of this slide. its not worth the money.
3,Banzai Fall Down,"First of all when I got this item, it was damaged. It had a couple of gashes like someone had opened it previously with a blade. It obviously had been repackaged. I would have sent it back, except it was way too heavy and big to get it neatly tucked back into its container and box.I decided to patch it up. The patches provided did the job, but the glue ran out quick. After that it was Banzai away. The slide is a lot of fun and my son had a blast. Because it arrived damaged I rated it a 3. If it had arrived in tip top shape, it would have been a 5."
3,"""New & Improved"" still falls apart","I also bought one of these slides in the summer of 2006, and yes, the box was marked ""new and improved"". It lasted for 2006 and then fell apart about half way through the summer last year (2007). Same problem as everyone, with the sides, footholes and handgrips ripping apart at the seams. I thoroughly dried my slide before putting it away for the season and hung it up in a dry shed for storage. I agree that it should be more durable for the price, and was disappointed that it only lasted 1 1/2 seasons, but I also bought it instead of renting one for my kid's birthday party, so I ended up saving money overall anyway."
1,Terrible,We attempted to purchase 2 bonzai slides. Neither had inflatable padding at the bottom of the slide. These are a saftey hazard - our children cried and were hurt going down the slide. We returned them both. Terrible.
1,"DON""T BUY THIS ONE!",It is super small. The pool is tiny. It was a huge disappointment. You think you are getting something much larger then this really is. Way too much money for this tiny tot toy.
1,not worth not money invested,"the kids loved this,the kids have such a blast but it only lasted a summer and 1/2 but we gave it another chance since the kids had so much fun with it and got a different one bigger and better (we thought) but same old story only this time it did'nt even last one whole summer and for the money i don't think its a good value i would rather spend my money on something that would last alot longer and the kids could enjoy it longer"
1,bad seams,"Well, the reviews didn't lie. We got this out of the box on a Monday night at 6pm. I had 2 boy's, 5&8 yrs old on it for 3 hours. The following day, they went on it for 1 hour, and it tore at 1 of the seams. 4 hours worth of fun and a bad tear. However, I had NO PROBLEM getting ahold of a customer rep at Banzai. They had it replaced within 2 weeks. It was not the same slide, b/c we were told they do not make this particular slide anymore, but they still replaced the defective product with no problems and got it to us promptly, no questions asked. I was pleased with their customer service, though my boys do not enjoy the new slide as much b/c the slide itself isn't as steep as the original banzai falls slide. So far, new slide is holding up, but we baby it only letting 2 kids at a time on it. I will not purchase another Banzai product. Too expensive for the type of material's used to make the slide's."
1,not very well made,"After only two weeks and one five year-old, 40 lb. girl, we have several rips in the seams. Don't waste you time or your money."
2,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!,"My Grandma bouhgt me this for my 10th b-day, and so I had me and my friends over my mom had me invite a girl that is the daughter of her friends. The thing is she was WAY overn the weight limit I tried to tell my Mom. ""Ethal"" the girl popped it after only ten minutes of playing on it. But after reading the other reviewsI think it popped not only because she was fat but that it was not made well. I want another one but I just will try and be more careful I hope my mom will let me only invite who I want."
2,it sucks,"I just got one for my kids. They went on one at a time. The first day we had it, it poped. My children got very mad and we returned the toy. They wouldnt let us get our money back. So it was a waste of money. Whoever gets this letter, and reads it, do not even think of getting it. Im very dissapointed in whoever made this crazy dissaster. Please no one buy it, its just a trick for people to get your money, and 300.00 dollors is to much for nothing. I think people should know this because this is the most suckiest thing weve got. Halo 2, i bet will not be a rip off, but banzai falls really sucks! Im anonymous sender beacause my name is freddy Tuddy Rihjust. HAHAHAHAHA. this toy really sucks by all names!......"
1,BETTER JUST RENT ONE...,I OWN A PARTY RENTAL COMPANY AND YOU SEE THE ONES THAT RENT FOR $150 ALL DAY COST $3000 AND IS MADE OF REAL MATERIAL. STICK WITH A RENTAL AND YOUR KIDS WILL ENJOY IT SAFELY. THEY SHOULD BE TAKING THESE OFF THE MARKET IF THEY ARE SO BAD.
1,Poor Quality,Slide was bought June 2005. Was great for the kids for last season. Set slide up yesterday and it would not hold air. Similar complaint noted at various web sites. This is a very expensive product to be used approx. 10 times before it is unuseable. Unable to reach manufacturer at number listed on the box. Line is busy. I would NEVER buy a product from this company again. Six Flag Corporation should be embarrassed to have their name associated with such poor quality and customer service.
2,Fun for one season,The kids had lots of fun on it for the first season. Took it out this season and it will not hold air and is coming apart at the seams. I reported this to toyquest.com and am waiting for them to respond.
5,Lots O' FUN!,"I bought this for a get together this past weekend and we had no problems whatsoever (except that our three year old started crying at 8AM this morning because I wouldn't ""blow up her slide"" b4 breakfast). Setup is easy, blows up in about a minute and gave our kids and friends (2-12) a full day of fun. We even had a few 180 lb. adults joining in. I don't know if it will last until next year, but it seems very durable, a lot like a commercial moon walk you'd find at a fairgrounds. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people who do not understand that the blower needs to be on for the whole time you use it. The seams are supposed to leak or it would pop pretty quickly. As for storage, it is probably a good idea to let it dry out for a few days or I would imagine that mold and mildew would eat away at the seams. Based on our experience, I think it will last at least for this season."
1,"Fun, but doesn't last","We bought this slide last year ('06) for our two kids, ages six and four. It lasted one summer. The kids loved it while it lasted, but through the summer, the mesh material underneath started deteriorating and it got periodic rips in it, which we patched. By the end of the summer, the entire center part between the slides ripped into a gaping hole (about two and a half feet in length). The slide's material was paper thin.When I called the manufacturer, I received no satisfaction. Those customer service representatives are clearly trained to admit nothing and give no concessions. I would strongly recommend against buying this slide, unless you want to throw your money away. It is fun, but over $400 for just one season is not worth it. By the end of the summer, the kids were so frustrated at having to wait to use the slide until the patches dried, they barely used it."
5,DID NOT LAST EVEN ONE DAY!!,"I am so disappoinnted in this product. It looked great and my grandkids were so excited. I had to look all over to find one and bought the last one the Toysrus had in my area, yeah for grandpa! The very first hour the seam burst just above where the water hose connects!! No way to repair at this spot. What a shame. This company must not have tested this product very well, or they knew about this and it was too late to do anything about it. I think they should recall this product!"
4,Don't Last long!,"I bought this for my son and the kids next door. They each went down it three times maybe, then the seam popped. I am just glad no one was hurt. (...)"
3,Good for kids 50# or less,"We purchased this slide for our grandchildren. Oldest was 9 and 50#. It is very easy to set up. It is important to allow air to escape through the 2 relief points, which also allows for sudden pressure during jumping on the slide. Ours ripped the second day but I believe it was because of the larger kids playing during the family reunion.I've looked into more expensive slides +$1,000. Maybe for the price I shouldn't expect too much, considering the alternative price for a more durable slide. With the pleasure my grandkids had that first day ..... I think it was worth it. I didn't pursue a return ... my fault."
1,Slide Review,"We bought this product for the July 4th weekend. One word of caution, the slide that was shown on the website was not the slide that was delivered. The manufacturer has changed the slide design since the Original Banzai was introduced 4 -5 years ago. The new design is much smaller, less durable, and has a pool where the kids splash into at the bottom. Unfortunately, after one use, the slide started to show signs of weakness and the seams started to come apart. We were not happy with the product and returned it to Amazon with no problems."
1,VERY DECEIVING,"The item over all was fun for smaller kids ages 2-5, but biggers kids can not enjoy it at all!! For the size of it, it is not worth the money put in to it. We thought this was much bigger because of the photo; however, that photo is deceiving, the children are photo cropped in to the inage!"
2,won't last more than 1 summer,"we had the same problem as many customers. slide worked great for one summer but after the winter we aired it up and the mesh had separated from the slide at the very bottom. Slide won't hold air but there are no tears or holes. Another problem, the company can't be reached. Too much money spent for only lasting one summer. Plus, since we spent alot of money on the slide, we took very good care of it. It should have lasted longer."
1,Cradle did not work,"Unfortunately, I did not comment on this product before. I found this palm cradle did not work. The palm does not get charged when in the cradle, nor does it sync with the computer !! First disappointing buy from Amazon !"
1,So I plugged it in and put my Tungsten T-3 into it and ....,and my Tungsten froze up. I knew the cradle looked smaller than my old one I use downstairs to hotsync to my Laptop. When I went down and tried my existing cradle? It works fine. -sigh-So despite the fact it us supposed to work with Tungsten T3? fuggetaboutit.Too much of a hassle to ship it back so looks like I'm SOL.jccampb
5,Palm HotSync Cradle for Tungsten,Excellent product and in NEW sealed original plastic wrapped boxes. I woudl highly recommend this product from Amazon. Excellent service and fast shipment.
2,Rug Hooking for the First Time,"Although this book is very thorough in directions and has some charming projects to work on, the cover was faded and it was stamped as a discarded book from a library in Pennsylvania. Although I understand this is no longer in print, I'm not sure about the ethics of selling a discarded public library book."
3,A little too country for me.,"I have tried hooking rugs many years ago and wanted a refresher. This paperback book was fairly thin and the designs are all primitive~country. The book is devoted to many of the basics: wool fabrics, and cutters and hooks. Mostly a beginner's manual (thus the title, which I should have realzed) with delightful colored pictures of the projects. The designs are really beautiful classics in the world of hooked rugs. I rated it a 3 because 1. I hoped for more varied, modern, geometric designs. 2. The feel of the book was not substantial. 3. I found the book at another store for much less money."
2,seemed impressive but didn't prove it,"this little camera seemed really great when I bought it - lots of features, powerful zoom, and a bargain. However it didn't perform.The battery compartment door was very flimsy and often wouldn't close properly. It got splashed with water and stopped working entirely - for good - and I couldn't get the roll of film out, had to take it to a camera repair place to extract it but it was also ruined. They remarked on the flimsiness of the camera's construction.I wouldn't recommend it - spend a little more and get something sturdier."
5,An extremely decent camera for the money,"This camera is a great deal for the price. It features the APS film system and a great zoom lens [80mm] at a price that is less than many other manufacturers' non-zoom APS cameras.The zoom is controlled and as powerful as one can reasonably expect. Generally speaking, the camera is both extremely easy to use and reliable. Used properly, it takes very good pictures. It is every bit as small as many much more expensive APS cameras, though it is a tad heavier than some. Overall, the Impax 300ix is a great bargain and an even better camera."
1,Save your money...get a camera from a real camera company,"I bought this camera with high expectations about two years ago...and have been riddled with problems ever since. I was hesistant to buy a Samsung camera, as this company is not very established in photography...but the features offered for the money seemed too good to pass up. When the camera does take pictures, they are of pretty good quality (except that the red-eye reduction frequently gets shut off by the brush of an unknowing fingertip)...but this happens rarely. From a month old the shutter would not open completely which ruined many shots...then a few weeks later, the drop-in loading became very tempermental. After a year of fighting with film...the camera decided to reject film altogether...leaving me stranded in Italy purchasing zillion-dollar disposables. ..."
1,PRETTY PICTURES-- HORRIBLE MISINFORMATION,"I have worked for many years in greyhound rescue so I naturally turned to the greyhound entry of this book first. I was absolutely struck dumb to find the book claiming that retired racers need frequent 13 MILE runs next to a horse or bike! This is total insanity. In truth, there is not a racer alive who is able or who desires to walk more than 1 or 2 miles a couple of times a week at most. These guys are SPRINTERS NOT MARATHONERS. Where on earth did the authors get this information? A quick check into any greyhound book or a call to any adoption agency would have set them straight instantly regarding greyhounds' very low exercise requirements-- they are truly couch potatoes. What is most upsetting is that these ""facts"" could scare off potential adopters. If the rest of the entires are as accurate as this one then this entire book is worse than useless."
4,"Excellent Dog Book, Though Incomplete for U.S. Readers","Very useful book for learning about the personality traits of different dogs. Includes easy to use tables showing grooming needs, exercise requirements, and suitability for apartment life. Also notes whether the breed is suitable for first time owners or is better for experienced owners.Prospective buyers should be aware that the book is a translation of a text originally published in Germany. Many of the breeds profiled are German breeds, presumably popular in their country of origin, but little known in the U.S. (And because so many German breeds are covered, many AKC breeds are omitted.)"
2,Something's missing...,"This book has a major omission. It claims to include ""all important breeds available to dog lovers..."" but, alas, the Pomeranian is not included. Why not??? Poms are the 10th most popular breed in the U.S. If the Entlebucher Sennenhund rates a page, then surely Pomeranians deserve a write-up."
1,Leaks!!!!!!!,We bought the Great Big Mable and it started to leak air on the second time out. It is a blast to rice but we have patched this thing time and time again. I would think twice before spending this mush money on the Big Mable!
2,Super Mabel... poor quality... leaks... leaks... leaks,"We had a Big Mabel for three years. The kids would rock on it, play king of the hill, and down right abuse it....etc. etc.... It sat on the dock, fully inflated during the summers. The zipper broke, but it never, ever leaked. Unfortunately, one day it floated away from our dock during a storm.The next year we bought a Super Mabel. EVERY SINGLE TIME we take it out, it gets a hole. The holes are always on the seams, and are always in one of two locations where the back curves to the bottom. I have now patched ten holes. I am over it.The problem I am having is that we love the curved design of the Mabels, but the quality of the product has declined so badly from 2006 until 2009, I am wondering what it is like in 2011???Having been an owner of two different Mabels, I can definitely confirm inflation is not the issue. It is manufacturing quality."
3,Fun but be prepared for leaking bladder,Fun stable tube but the bladders leak like crazy. Have had 4-5 replacement bladders myself and several other families have the same issue. They will tell you it is due to improper inflation but that is not true. They have now redesigned the entire tube because of this.[...]
3,"Great Tube, Weak Bladder","Bought my Big Mable over 1 year ago. The first summer it worked great, held up well. Second season has been one tube leak after another. Currently putting my 6th or 7th patch on tube. As soon as I fix one hole another opens up. Also the zipper on the outer cover broke the second time we used it, but it has not affected performance."
2,not strong enough for tennis,"I have used wrist braces for tendinitis while playing tennis in high school, college, and even post-college. The old-fashioned, simple braces always worked well, but they don't seem to make them anymore, so I recently switched to this. I used it for a few months, but my wrist got worse and worse and I finally had to stop. It feels very comfortable, but it just didn't provide enough support. I recently switched to a new kind where you wrap the support around once, then wrap a second, narrower strap, on top of that. I was wary about it, but it seems to work really well--much stronger support. The one I now use is: Futuro Sport Wrap Around Wrist Support, also from Amazon.The one I'm reviewing here may be good if you only need a small amount of support."
1,The wrist support dies a little each time you take it off.,The velcro closures distorts and warps the elastic every time it is taken off - very limited product lifespan. Support is adequate but creates a constricting effect on the forearm. The heat crimp on the ends of wrap is uncomfortable on the skin.
1,Wrist band,"I ordered this wrist band for my husband..... he is completely disatisfied with this product, it doesn't offer any support for his wrist.... we are in search for a better wrist band."
1,unpleasant fragrance and skin irritation,"I've been using this product daily for almost two months and will return it due to intense skin irritaion. In the beginning, I received compliments on how I looked, but suddenly my face is burning after application. And it is recommended to apply several times a day!"
5,Laughing and going aaah,"I loved this fairy tale! There was a lot of laughter, a whole lot of romance, cute kids, a villain, a wicked witch, a crusty old judge and of course - the cast of Mayberry (small town people). The hero and the heroine get their HEA in the court room while the judge is banging his gavel. (the sex was pretty good, too) This is worth reading just for the Times the heroine spent driving a stick shift and later learning how to drive one! I think Disney should make this into a movie (lol) Enjoy.."
4,Quite Good,"Reinhard Seifried is a veteran German conductor who has recorded from time to time for Naxos. This reading of Ma Vlast is well worth the asking price. It is clearly recorded, and generally well played. The Kosice orchestra is somewhat smaller than ususal, but their ensemble is excellent and they really bring the flavor of a Bohemian orchestra to their performance. Seifried's interpretation is fairly standard, although you will have a tough time differentiating him from the many Czech conductors who have recorded the score. If you can afford one of the Kubelik recordings of Ma Vlast, they are quite special and well worth the extra outlay. Otherwise, Seifried's performance would be a nice addition to anybody's collection."
1,Great idea but breaks easily.,"Have been looking all over for a good bubbler. Several years ago bought a plastic one for a couple dollars and found it was the greatest thing for watering container plants and spot watering beds. Since I have added more plants, had need another for a second and third line. Bought one of these and loved it, but the head broke off. So when I saw someone had was selling them at close out price of $3.00, I bought three. Regretfully, have broken two more in less than a season. The problem is the head is very thin aluminum and if you drop it when you finish using it, the head can break of where it screws onto the hose. Or if you try to screw the bubbler on by twisting its head, it comes right off. All in all, a very poor execution of product that can be of great use.And yes, the old cheap plastic bubbler just keeps working. Drops concrete, no problem. Twist the head to tighten, no problem. My only problem is I can't find more of them."
2,Hard water eats these fragile things like popcorn,"I like the idea and have used various bubblers for over 40 years. I bought 3 GILMOUR 315MTL's which have a lifetime replacement policy. I don't know what alloy of aluninum GILMOUR uses but my hard well water made short work of the 1st one.Aside from the hard water problem, and probably of more interest to the normal purchaser, is the hose adaptor is simply crimped into the bubbler head. Each of mine came apart at one time or another but can be reinstalled only to come off again with less effort. I would think these bubblers, with Chinese labor, could have all parts and pieces rivited or tac welded together. I have parts of 2 bubblers to return to be replaced but to what end?I'm using a heavy work sock until I can find a better value."
3,Funky Disco,"This is not the pure unadulterated kind of funk you might be expecting having only heard Parliament/Funkadelic's earlier work, or only having seen the P.Funk All-Stars live. Rather, it is more of a funky strain of disco, slightly cheesy at times (was that a drum machine I just heard?) But as we all know George Clinton and his crew have more funk in their little toes then most funk bands could ever hope to have. U.D.G. is a good addition to any collection, especially if like G.C.'s Greatest Funkin' Hits. If you want ""da bomb"", invest in the live 4 CD set: Parliament-Funkadelic Live 1976-1993, and be blown away..."
2,"If you love the novel, avoid the film","Having been a reader of the novel The Horse's Mouth for the past fifty= years, I came to the file with high expectations of seeinga version of what I had been imagining over the years. Guinness' work had always been first class and I expected him to do a decent job of Gulley Jimson and Cary's story. Disappointment! The film is a travesty of the story and I was unable to sit through the whole film.Two stars for the photography, none for the acting."
4,hard to find gem,"This movie is different from others of the same time period starring Alec Guinness (Lavendar Hill Mob, Lady Killers, Kind Hearts and Coronets). The Horse's Mouth is funny and outrageous, but has a serious side that comes through beautifully. Fascinating liner notes shed light on the whole production, which was very controversial at the time. You will never find this one at a chain video store!"
3,Decent movie but easily forgetable.,"Guinness's character is a bit ""mad"", perhaps like many talented artists. Besides painting he is an eccentric a hustler, a con, in short a rouge. Im a bit biased, I always enjoy Alec Guinness but this movie may not appeal to those who don't. In this not only starring but he also wrote and directed it. One thing I found interesting in the story is the amount of sexual tension in it. Watch it if you like comedy movies that arent run of the mill."
3,The picture quality of the Bunuel DVDs from Cinemateca,"Woman Without Love (Ws Sub B&W;)As a couple of the movies of Bunuel from Mexico have got a bad treatment referring to the transfer to DVD+, I would like to know about the picture quality of the Cinemateca's DVD version of A Woman Without Love. Of course this is also very important to know because of the upcoming Cinemateca-DVDs of Bunuels The Brute and Susana.+ VCI Entertainments 50th Anniversary Edition of Adventures of Robinson Crusoe was a great disappointment to me, because of the poor picture quality (I have seen a much better version of this movie on televison (on ARTE Canal in Germany/France) and also WCL/Yume Pictures' transfer to DVD of Ascent to Heaven was a great disappointment also referring to the poor picture quality (this movie I have also seen in a much better version on the televisoon canal ARTE)"
5,GREAT FOR YOUR BACK!,"IF YOU HAVE BACK PROLEMS, DO YOUR STREATCHING WITH THIS FOAM ROLLER BECAUSE IT HELP ME WITH MY BACK'S INFLAMMATION. GOOD LUCK!"
4,It's a good book.,"Interesting and well written. Very easy to follow the story line. If you liked Cormac McCarthy's ""All the Pretty Horses"" series, this is one book that you will appreciate."
1,I suggest Cormac McCarthy first,"For a better version of this book, read ""Blood Meridian"" by Cormac McCarthy. The content of ""Rogue Blood"" was a large disappoint to me as I had enjoyed Blakes earlier books. Read them both and decide for yourself."
2,Disappointing,"Having read Blake's ""The Pistoleer"" and ""Friends of Pancho Villa"", I was looking forward to this one. While I agree that Blake is a marvelous craftsman, the two protagonists in this story, as well as pretty much every other character in the book, are total dirt-bags without a single redeeming quality. There is so much gratuitous blood and gore that the printer should have just used red ink. If you want to know more about the San Patricios, check outJames Alexander Thom's ""Saint Patrick's Battalion"". A great read without all the gore."
5,One of the Most Underated Forgotten Gems,"Do you like the single ""The Warrior""? Of course you do! And the rest of this album is just great. This is not one of those one-good-song albums. You won't believe this group only recorded one and a half albums(Patty Smyth did go on to record two OK solo albums)! The songs are filled with guitar hooks. ""All I Want"", ""Beat of a Heart"", ""Hands Tied"": they're all great. A real gem from the mid-eighties of guitar chord pop-rock. Only 3 tracks from here are on the Patty Smyth greatest hits CD, the other 7 are not."
1,Contractor grade hose - NOT,"This hose doesn't deserve any stars at all. I made the mistake of buying four at once believing they would actually live up to the advertising. Well, in cold weather they mold to the shape you store them and kink like crazy when you try to unwind them. Terrible hoses!"
3,Don't buy from Deerso,"I ordered this hose based on the manufacturer's description and specs on their web site. Sorry to go a little off-topic, but this rating is for the seller, Deerso, not the hose. Deerso shipped me the wrong item, albeit same size and length. When I contacted them about it, I was told the hose I received was an equal value, same cost and durability. But it was a typical green ""homeowner"" garden hose. It was not the heavier-duty hose in the seller's description.I eventually found the correct hose locally because the so-called equivalent hose from Deerso kinked easily and eventually failed at one of its usual kink spots. The seller was not willing to exchange the correct item, due to the shipping cost no doubt."
4,Great for the price!,"I purchased 4 of these for my son and his friends. I thought they would make great birthday gifts, especially at such a great price! The only thing I was disappointed with was that in the description it said it wasn't suitable for children under 3 and when I got it home it was for ages 8 and up. The kids I bought it for are 5 and 6 years old. However, my son loved building it and he had some great father son bonding since he needed a lot of help. It was fun for him to build his own robot!"
3,Not so impressed.,"This robot is difficult to construct for a kids and after construction, there is little what it does."
5,Extremely comfortable!,"These are more durable than any of my hiking boots or combat boots ever were, and far more comfortable than any of my other shoes - including my fuzzy slippers (though I must admit that the fuzzy slippers were a bit of a disappointment).I wear these for just about everything that doesn't require dress shoes now. If I had been smart enough to order them in black, I wouldn't need the dress shoes, either."
4,Good boots at a great price,"I tried these boots at boot barn and they didn't have my size, now I am glad they didn't! Amazon had them for nearly $30 cheaper!! The only downside to these boots is that they are made in china. Good luck finding a boot made in the us for less than $400 . Just plain sad."
5,Comfortable Classic,"I have such a hard time finding footwear that fits because my feet are 4E wide. I gave up trying to find comfortable cowboy boots many years ago. Quite by accident I found these boots and even though they are 2E wide they fit as well as running shoes. The leather is not stiff and the soles are good looking black rubber.It's nice to be able to wear good looking boots again for every day footwear instead of some ugly lace up cross trainers. I'm buying this pair as a backup for the first pair that I bought at a boot store last year. Those boots are still good, but they've been abused a bit and I want a nice pair that is not all scratched and beat from working outside.I especially like the low heel. I just can't pull off the pointy toe, high heel boot look anymore. These boots are just right."
3,"Product appears good; however, sizing is way off.","I indicated ""item NOT described by the seller"" because the sizing seems to be off. I've worn a 10 1/2 narrow for over 40 years. I've never had a ""fit"" problem until now. The Ariat's seemed to be about two sizes too small. I could not even begin to get my foot into the boot.HOWEVER, the quality seemed fine; delivery was on time. It took only slightly over a week to get the refund to my credit card after shipping back the boots. I'm leery of trying to order another pair online since I am out the cost of the return shipment."
4,Comfortable sole,"Overall I'm pleased. Got the 2EE which is really only 1E. Fit all of my foot well except the heel area is not as snug as the rest. The shank is very large and I have big calves. Made a lot of noice walking because the open area would slap the inside of my jeans. The sole is very comfortable. Could wear for 14-16 hrs without having the ""can't wait to take off"" urge. No blistering at all either. The side pipeing didn't dig into my ankles either."
5,boots,"I purchased these along with a brown and brushed letter, The boots are as described. I was a little worried about the fit but had done my homework. The size was right and the boots are very comfortable. In fact, I have not not worn my regular dress shoes much since I purchased these. The more I wear them, the more comfortable they are."
3,XS was still too big for my 4lb chihuahua,"I was really excited to order this, but hugely dissapointed once I got it. I ordered the xs, as I have a relatively small chihuahua, and it was still too large. Plus, it is shaped oddly, like it was sewn for a doll, but not for dogs, as we all know that dogs arms face downwards, not out to the sides. So, I have to get it taken in (the things I do for this dog!), so that it may fit him a bit better. Even so, he will probably only wear it for the ceremony. This does not contain a tiny top hat, though how adorable would that be! Also, not the best quality, as it is already fraying around the collar."
3,Button missing,"It's a really cute costume but when I received the package there was a button missing on the back and it was nowhere to be found in the package. It wasn't worth returning for $5 something so I will just sew a new one on, but pretty disappointed given the price of the costume plus s/h.My dog is a 6 lb chihuahua and the XS fits him perfectly."
5,Love it!,"I used this for my teacup Chihuahua for our wedding, he was our ring barrer. Perfect wedding attire for our special day. :) I didn't use the hat though, it wouldn't form right and I worked on it for a week. He still looked great without it though."
3,"Cute costume, slightly small","My long-haired chihuahua was a bit snug in the XS, but that's likely because of his thick coat. Cute costume :)"
3,XS is too small for pomeranians,"I have a rather small pom, and according to the chart, XS should fit him. It didn't. So I exchanged it with a small."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I don't know if I was wrong in expecting this sleep cap to be breathable enough for me to put my hair in rollers when it is wet, and put this cap over it to keep everything in place, and still have my hair dry overnight. My hair is long-ish (a little past my shoulders) but it is not thick. I used it once and probably won't use it again unless for some reason I need to hold a dry hair style in place, which is not something I ever do. This might be helpful for braided hair (cornrows) to not mess it up, but even then I would prefer to use something thinner on my head. This is rather bulky and is foam texture, and that little poof that they show on top is weird and has a solid plastic ring gathering the fabric loosely, so you can't tighten it. It's just weird. Maybe I didn't understand the purpose of this thing."
4,Baby's Book: The First Five Years (Personal Organizers),This is a well designed traditional baby's journal. I liked the layout and the presentation.
5,This is the best baby book!!,I found this baby book after having my first son. I was sitting at home filling out a baby book I had got at his shower answering questions like how much does a gallon of milk cost. It was so silly!!! So in the trash it went as soon as I found this baby book. I LOVED it!! It is perfect... tons of spots for photos and information on the baby with out all the silly stuff that so many of the baby books have in them. Plus there are tons of pockets for little things like artwork and whatever. My son's is packed full of all sorts of things and can still hold more! I bought this same baby book when I was pregnant with my daughter and have been enjoying it all over again. Now I am thinking about picking up one more just incase I have another baby one day. : ) This baby book is great... you can't go wrong with it.
5,Great Baby Book,I was delighted with all the different pages. Seems to have a place for almost everything. The monthly photo section is my favorite I think. The book is made very well and should hold up for years and years. My only complaint is that I wish it had more envelopes to tuck small keepsakes in. But it shouldn't be a problems for me to add more in. This is still the best Baby's book you can get for this price. And I spent long hours hunting for the perfect one.
4,ok,"This book is great only wish the pages was bigger than it is. If you have a 8.5"" times 11"" pages it wont fit u have to cut it or fold it."
4,Love this book,I did alot of research to find a good baby book to follow up with my maternity journal that I started when I got pregnant. I love where you can put so many picures including each month up to a year. I am going to buy another one to give as a shower gift for a friend of mine. I wish it had more places to write after 1 year but the first year pages are wonderful. Anyone that wants to keep track of milestones this is a great book.
4,Great 5 year coverage,"Great book. Covers 5 years beautifully. I would only not have a month by month for the first year, as there is too much to fill in."
4,nice little book,"well..I like the book overall,but it I wish it had more pages about doc visits, and also firsts...my baby book from when i was a baby had pages of firsts. I wish this had the same..im just going to make my own and put em in i guess. Anyways, overall, it is worth the money, especially compared to others i have seen"
3,ok book but not the best,"from reading several reviews and doing Tons of research I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. There aren't many spots for pictures, there's no chart for teeth, and no chart for growth. I will be looking for a different book. It's very plain on the inside and doesn't have many pictures or designs compared to what I had for a baby book years ago. Sure there are pockets for storing things and one small clear envelope to put something in, though I'm afraid it'll fall off. What disappointed me the most was the time it took to get here. I purchased other items and they were all supposed to get here at the same time, but they didn't. The book didn't arrive until 4 days after my other purchases, and I requested it all be shipped at once. Spend the extra time and money to purchase a baby book that has everything you want and that is of good quality. Both you and later your child will appreciate it."
3,Based on my wifes responses this is alright,"My wife likes it, she uses it. It holds pictures and whatnot. We have an older book from my first boy that she likes better but wasn't able to find again. I don't know what the differences are...I think she just doesn't like change but don't tell her I said that, thanks."
5,Wonderful product,"This baby book was so much more than I expected. The colors and pictures are beautiful, and it would be great for a boy or a girl. There is plenty of space to record all of your precious memories."
5,Soitenly Is A Lot Of Fun!,"The Three Stooges have always been my favorite comedy team. So when I heard that they were coming out with a new Three Stooges Game Boy Advance game, I was thrilled! So I bought the game, and believe me, I was so happy that I got this game! This game features many of my favorite things that I see while watching the Stooges. There is the oyster contest, which is seen in the short ""Dutiful But Dumb"". There is also the boxing match, where Larry breaks his violin while trying to play ""Pop Goes The Weasel"", and he has run to the radio store to get a radio playing Curly's fighting song before the six rounds of boxing are up. There is also pie fighting, hospital chasing, and many more things to do. I recommend this to people who love the Three Stooges and who also love playing video games. This is the best!"
4,Good game,"This is a very fun game. I had this game for the original nes and i still play it sometimes. It is 2 players and has lots of many games you play. The object of the game is to save the orphanage. Some of the games are: soup eating, pie throwing, boxing, doctor, trivia, etc. I might buy this game, but I'm not sure, since it is a direct port, although upgraded in graphics, of the game i already have."
3,A must for Stoogies only,"I'm a Knucklehead/Stoogie, so I bought the game. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else though. It gets boring REAL Fast, and the mini games that you have to play are pretty easy. Of course, this is a re-issue of an old game. If you liked the old game, you're sure to like this. But if you're not after nostalgia for that old game, or a die hard knucklehead, you should SOITENLY skip it."
1,Very disapointing and not fun.,"I bought this a year or so ago at Costco because I love the Three Stooges (and I'm female!) and I love cartoons (John K creator of Ren & Stimpy is a huge fan of the Stooges as well) and I needed some more games for my fairly new GBA. It isn't fun. You have to play several different mini games a bunch of times, and they are very difficult and not even fun, hardly even mildly entertaining. You have to raise $5000 in a month for the orphans, I was lucky if I ever got up to $500 after a frustrating 20 minutes till the game was already over. I'll be trading mine in at Gamestop next week."
3,LIKE THE SHOWS,"THE GAME IS GOOD (IT REALLY IS).BUT THEY MADE TO...STRANGE.WAY TOO PREDICTABLE WITH MINI GAMES.BUT IF YOU WANT TO SOMETHING DIFFERNT AND FUN,THIS IS YOUR PICK(EVEN STOOGE FANS WILL ONLY PLAY OCCASIONLY)."
2,"A stooge fan says ""YUK""","I love the Stooges. I have 30-odd of their movies, I have their picture framed on my wall. I bought this game as a matter of course but took it back the next day because it was so bad.The mini-games are very repetitive. The grocery store and the hospital are essentially the same games in different trim. I never could figure out the soup game and switching between stooges in the pie throwing was a real pain.The only good points were the trivia (which was almost fun) and hearing the clips from the movies (though they got old because there are not vary many).This game had a place back in the 80's when it came out. Compared with the games coming out today, it doesn't measure up."
2,IT'S NOT VERY GOOD...IT KIND OF SUCKS,"ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. ""on again tonight"" is the reason i bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say ""don't listen to him"". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on ""beer man"" and ""on again to night"" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.don't waste your money on it...i did"
5,Palm Portable Keyboard,"I have been looking for a reasonable priced keyboard for my Palm M500. This is perfect, fullsize keys are so much better than my previous keyboard which had small rubbery keys. I can work quicker using this keyboard. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for Palm Keyboards."
4,"The delivery was fast, grat product.","The product(PalmOne Portable Keyboard)is what I was looking for. The ordering process wes grate,and it was delivered in a timely fashion."
4,A great tool,"It solves the problem of the slow process of inputing data using the stylus in a nice small and portable package.I have tried the compact keyboards that attach to the bottom, and they just dont compare. A full size keyboard is the way to go.The only problem is its fragility, but if you have a palm you already know about its fragility and how to care for it."
2,Limited Usability,"This is the first review I have ever written on a product. I am writing it because, I am frustrated. I am apparently missing something or this keyboard is unusable. Sure you can type text fine. However, what keyboards are also useful for is navigation. In other words, the Palm Stylus is to a mouse as what I expected this keyboard to be to a computer keyboard. In short, this keyboard provides no method to any of the following without the stylus, as an example.CAN'T DO:Select an appointment in the datebook to edit it.Select a memo in the Memo List to edit it.Select any record in any 3rd party applications to edit it.Scroll the date viewTab to controls (e.g., buttons, dropdowns)So on ...The Cancel or Done key combination rarely works, even for the default applications.In short, you can't use the keyboard independently of the stylus the way you can use a computer keyboard independently of a mouse -- which was a BIG disappointment."
2,Disappointing software,"I'm a re-entry nurse and bought several books and videos to refresh my memory of nursing procedures and skills. This software contained a lot of good information, but nothing that wasn't covered, almost verbatim, in other clinical skills books. I'm not sure what they meant by interative, but the only thing you can do is click on the index to bring up a particular subject and then bookmark it. There are very few photos--most things are illustrated with drawings, and some procedures don't have any illustrations which I found disturbing. For example, the section on arteriovenous shunts and how to care and change the dressings, has no photos or drawings at all. The video clips were especially disappointing--very, very few and they are only about 5 seconds long, making them, in my opinion, useless. If you like to use the computer, then this is an OK software package, but for the same type of information, I prefer a book that I can access easily and take with me."
3,"The Ancient Adam has always been a ""Black Man.""","For whatever its worth; at least C. McGhee Livers knows that the Hebrew-English transliteration Ahdahm which has been translated into the English tongue as Adam, does not literally mean ""Red-Man"" as many unlearned ministers, and theologians may teach."
2,Stretched Too Far!,"I am currently working on a degree in Hebrew Studies, and Ancient History. I found the material stretched to the extreme, and the author's premise was weak from either lack of evidence, or the wrong evidence. I also think, she tried to make the material or scriptures fit her theory."
3,Good but...,Good information but she goes a little too far in the analysis and application of the information.
1,Not the correct understanding of the bible...,The Holy Bible clearly states that the Israelites (so-called Blacks and Latinos) are the chosen people of God Deut 7:6. How can we be Canaanites when the Lord specifically told the Israelites to destrory the Canaanites and other nations Deut 7:1-5. Also in the book of Deut 28:15-68 tells you about the curses that would befall the Blackman woman and child for breaking the laws of the Most High God. Check it out today in your unrevised version of the KJV of the Holy Bible.
5,"Astounding Book Revives Souls,Breaks Low Self-Esteem Forever","This is one of the best written and most informative books that I have ever read. The author is a Greek and Hebrew Language scholar. She has translated selected text from a copy of the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts of the Old and New Testament Bible. As she translated these languages into English she found details concerning the origin of Mankind. This book includes details concerning the following: Blacks' Great Biblical Heritage, Origin of Blacks Revealed, Black Skin: A Sign of Prosperity, Origin of Whites and Jews Revealed. These details are not made known in the English translations of our present Bibles. Every household should have a copy of this revolutionary work. The author notes on the back of her book that she believes she was predestined to write this book, ""For such a time as this."" Although a copy of this book is now hard to find, it can be found at [...]."
3,Some of us enjoyed this,"The wife loved it. I enjoy Hoskins in small doses, so I will not watch it on three consecutive nights (two episodes per night) as she did. I feel some series have to be digested more slowly."
5,Best of Comedy,"Discovering that Flickers is available on DVD was the high point of the day. Just the day before my friends were lamenting that this wonderful series had never been made available to the public. It was my first introduction to that wonderful actor Bob Hoskins, although the entire cast was wonderful.This is one of the best blends of sheer comedy combined with touching romance as two totally mismatched people forced together by circumstances learn to cherish each other. Don't miss this one."
5,Surprising Value,"I have over 50 years of camping experience and have owned many bags in my life. Not wanting to spend a lot of money at present I bought this bag taking a chance (How good could it be for $40.00?) I am flabbergasted at the excellent quality and features. It fits into the stuff sack without too much trouble and its size and weight when packed is what you would expect of a 0 degree non-down bag. It is far superior to the previous $120 lb bag my daughter absconded with last year. Highly recommended! Very well made. While I see the price has risen since I bought mine, it is still a good deal"
4,Good bag for the price,"I bought this bag for my son.It is good quality and kept him more than warm. My only complaint is getting it back in the bag for storage. In my limited experience, every bag I've had has had this problem and this isnt any different. I only used this once. I dont know how it will last."
3,great but very bulky,I bought this for my daughter for a 4 day comping trip. She said it kept her warm but it was very large. A good value.
4,Great price for what you get,"I selected this sleeping bag, so that I don't have to carry extra blankets for chilly nights in the mountain. Unfortunately, I bought it too late for my car camping season, so I haven't tried it out yet. But here are what I see so far:Pros:- Very nice design. When I got in there, I was snuggled up nicely. Shoulder straps ad a nice touch for extra warmth.- Great price for what you get.Cons:- Very heavy. The outer fabric and filling are not those high-end, hardcore expensive materials (like Marmot).- It came with a stuff sack, but the dimention is unpractical. Too wide around and short. If you really want to take the bag to backpacking, you might want to consider making/getting a different dimention stuff sack, so that you can carry it better."
4,Pretty Good Bag For a Hiking Trip,This bag has a comfort zone of 15 degrees and i have gotten it down to 10 degrees with ease of not a chill in my body.Pros:1. Built well with good sticthing.2. Nice zipper with non-catch object.3. Inner pad for you neck with a pulley to keep you air around your head fresh but your body warm.Cons:1. Slippery material
4,Coleman North Rim Zero Degree Mummy Bag,I bought this for a neice that wanted it for a camping trip and specified zero degree. I read quite a few reviews of the zero degree sleeping bags online and this one had the best reviews and included that the design helped keep feet warm and that the way the top is constructed helps keep the head and especially neck warm. We will find out soon - she is going to hike into the mountains next week (first week of January) and spend the night sleeping out there with friends in her new sleeping bag. All the reviews said she will stay warm and toasty!
4,Very warm... don't like the zippers,Hard to get into and zipped all the way up... my head doesn't really fit in the head part so I have to wear a hat when I sleep... no biggie... it's warm.
4,warm,"so far so good for the cost, allitle tight, but it is a sleeping bag not a queen bed. doesnt compress very well ,"
1,zipper busted,Did the zipper break on anybody else's sleeping bag? The zipper is totally shot when the bag is less than 3 months old. Is there any warranty on such a problem?
2,manufacturer's defect,"Got this sleeping bag for a camping trip and the first time I went to use it the zipper broke. I tried re-zipping it and it continued to break over and over. It may be a manufacturer's defect, I'm not sure. I would not recommend this product to anyone and will not buy from this company again."
2,Definitely not for 0 degree weather.,"I bought this sleeping bag and camped out in a friend's backyard when the low was 37 degrees fahrenheit. It wasn't too cold at first, although I had to zip up the bag and tighten the hood as much as I could even before the temperature was below 50.However, at about 4 or 5 am I woke up because I was too cold to sleep. I now use it when I sleep indoors and the temperature gets down to 60 degrees and it's just fine for that. There's nothing particularly bad about this product except for the fact that it does not provide nearly enough insulation to back up its ""0 degree"" claim. I'm returning it."
3,Warm but extremely hard to roll up!,I used it in the outback of Australia. You can't really sleep in that bag just on the floor but that is the case of most sleeping bags. We all had to sleep in our sleeping bags over a mattress. The very down side is rolling it up and put it into the bag that it comes with. I had to roll it 3 times before succeeding!
3,Warm and good quality,Great for camping. Kept me warm and my son didn't complain about his either.The only compliant is ti it almost impossible to compress and fit into the sack. It actually took us a while to get the bag out of the sack.For that reason I would not recommend it for a young Scout starting to become more independent. Also a no go for Hiking.
3,Its thinner than it looks,Maybe it is suppose to be tight or I'm just wider than I should be but it's hard to zip up. Very warm though and think it will work out well on my camping trip next week.
4,Good Bag,This is a good bag for cold weather. It is easy to rip and doesn't work for warm campouts but it is otherwise great.
2,is the bag the same as the picture?,I read reviews that this bag comes in a different color when ordering.So when you ordered yours was it the same or was it different.I hope its not the cheaper ones.
2,bulky bag,I bought this bag for my son's back packing trip in the sierras. I have another Coleman bag that is not to big for a pack. This took up over half the pack. Way to bulky and heavy. It is probably a great car camping bag.
3,Coleman 0-Degree Mummy Bag,"I'm in the military and we are not provided with sleeping bags so I purchased this and use it 15-20 days out of each month. I've used this bag in field conditions down to about 20 degrees and I was cold. I lived, but had to layer up with some fleece. Its very durable, Ive slept in it approximatly 180 days and put it through hell and so far no rips or significant signs of wear. It is a pain in the neck to get back into its carrier even though I do it weekly."
1,Should replace the F with a C,"As soon as I opened this bag I had a feeling it wouldn't perform as advertized. I often sleep in my backyard so I tried it three times and was chilled enough to come back into the house when the temps hit just the mid to high thirties. It doesn't work nearly as well as my last zero degree bag which could take me, comfortably, down to 15-20 degrees. Very disappointing. I'm returning it."
2,Stay warm by trying to re-pack?,"Great bag that keeps you warm but when you wake up in the morning it is not fun to try to re-pack. They should have given it a bigger bag. What is more important? Stay warm, or struggle packing? I would rather stay warm...better yet, there are other bags out there to choose from..."
4,Warm but big,This sleeping bag is definitely too large for backpacking unless you strap it to the outside but it is very warm.
1,Boring!,"Bruce Campbell has really let his work slide. Not once was there mention of the dead, evil or not. The guy makes a few cult films and suddenly he's also a ""Children's Author"", like he's some sort of Jack of All Trades. What's next? Co-authoring a pop-up book with Ted Raimi? Nothing short of a Herculean effort can save him from where his career's headed.(just kidding, love you Bruce)"
1,"Confusing, Tricky and Frustrating","This is by far one of the worst textbooks I have ever used in my life. It made my life EXTREMELY difficult, the problems are tricky and at times they will be give you information that will completely throw you off until you are too frustrated to try to figure it out. The text is of little help when it comes to answering some of the questions. I definately would not recommend it to anyone who has not had experience with accounting."
5,You'll love them all,"I bought the anthology because of the Inspector Terry Novella, ""The Pangs of Prophecy"" by Christine Spindler (one of my favorite authors), and ended up becoming a fan of the other three authors as well. Iles' Sheriff Okie Bliss and his hilarious sidekick Walker Whitlow have a chilling case to solve. Dearl's wonderful Taylor Madison outwits a ghost. Dan Sontup has created a brilliant new serial character with his unique Matt Ridley, chief of mall security. Spindler shows a lighter side of her gay gentleman Inspector. All in all, an excellent collection with intelligent plots, surprising twists and charming characters."
2,Might be worth $30 but unfit for the Professional,"I have always been a fan of American DJ products as I have several lights by them. I just ordered this item and when I got it, it left me with a bad thought about American DJ. Yea, this product is very compact and lightweight which was my intention, but the light does not move unless linked to lighting controllers. It powers on fine and shines fine but don't ""rotate to the beat of the music"". The other thing that was a major setback is the gazer does not have a built-in fan like most of the lights do and this light gets VERY VERY hot within a couple of seconds. Betime you turn on the light, you will need to turn it off. I am very unhappy that American DJ made such a doll effect."
3,Barbie Diaries - Barbie Doll,"Any little girl or little boy(interested in Barbie too), that is has a PASSION for MUSIC will be inspired by this Rockin' in Pink Barbie doll!The GOOD THINGS about this doll is that there's 3 rockin' songs, the doll is pretty, lots of items inside the package, and her outfit is very new generation=)The BAD THINGS about this doll is that her other arm is forever bent, which is sad because MATTEL could have had it straight & bended at the same time. Another thing is that, this doll looks like it can only be for performing...You can't do much with this Barbie doll. She can only be like a statue, it's because of her bent arm..."
5,Wonderful!,"This doll is dazzling! Not only does she capture the modern teen look, Barbie has taken it once more to the extreme with a new movie. The doll's guitar plays several hip musical tunes. This year, Barbie is capturing young ones with Mermaidia, teens and pre-teens, such as myself, with the Barbie Diaries. What is even more amazing is that Mattel has obtained original Barbie. I recommend this doll and collection of dolls and accessories for ages 8-16. Those are most likely the ages that will enjoy her the most. Whereas I do not currently own her, I have seen Barbie Diaries Barbie in stores. I marveled at her beauty.Chelsea Churro(My Scene/Bratz fan;Peacekeeper)over, & OUT!!!!!P.S.-END THE WAR!!!!!!!-Hannah(Texas)12 YEAR OLD MY SCENE, BRATZ, BARBIE, POLLY, AND LITTLEST PET SHOP FAN"
4,Kinda Cool,"I don`t like Barbie,but this one is nice I think.It`s 10000000000000%times more beautiful then princess Annika.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LIKER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*I AM NOT A BARBIE FAN BUT I STILL LIKE THIS ONE."
2,Its okay,The only really good part of this film is when they arrive in NYC. It's cool to see all the lights and buildings of NYC in a Jason movie. It's really nice at the end when it's morning.
3,An interesting undertaking,"Adding as much humor as it did is quite refreshing for this series. Although part 7 is still the best of the series, part 8 has proven itself comical with a couple chills. The scenes on the huge boat are the best. Part 7 and 8 are worth a rental. One thing that this one is missing that part 7 had was character development. GRADE: B-"
4,Would Jason have coffee with the locals....,"...If he killed all the people that he followed to NYC? Here's why I say, he could have gone on a virtual killing spree while he was in the subway car, and in the restaurant. So if he killed the last 2 kids from Crystal lake, I believe he'd get coffee at the diner and pay for the damage he did to that nice mirror. Only 12 seniors in the entire school? Wow. Sorry so critized, but its fun and 4 stars"
5,Best of the Series!,"Personally, I thought that Friday the 13th Part VIII - Jason Takes Manhattan was the best of the entire series. I couldn't believe that so many people thought that it was terrible, I heard it was the least liked of all of them, but I thought otherwise.First of all, it stars Kane Hodder, the best Jason ever, and has a good plot unlike the others. A pleasant school trip to Manhattan aboard a cruise ship changes into terror when Jason comes aboard. Members of the ship safely get on a lifeboat and land in Manhattan, not knowing Jason conveniently followed them there.In this sequel, Jason not only does his usual slaughtering but also toys with them a bit and uses new techniques in his killings. This is the first where I thought that Jason looked like he was really trying hard and giving a 110 percent attempt to get the victims. Plus what isn't cooler than seeing Jason just walking the streets of Manhattan. I definitely recommend this film to everybody."
1,the worst of the series,"Being a big fan of the series I was shocked to see how this movie played out. What you have here is probably the worst movie ever made. The acting is terrible, most of the movie takes place on a ship instead of New York, and the writers of the next movie in the series (jason goes to hell) don't acknowledge this movie's existence. I watched this in the theatres and I knew we were in for a long one cause there was about 300 seats and only five people showed up. I'm not going to elaborate too much, just do yourself a favor and steer clear."
3,"Sort of disappointing, unfortunately...","I bought this video a couple of months back on a total whim; Jason X was on its way to the cinema and I thought I'd better catch up with the saga so far. Big mistake! It certainly does feature a lot of Mr Vorhees (which is always good) but the murders are goreless and boring, and the acting is tedious. Only one bit really sticks in my mind (**POTENTIAL SPOILER**) and thats when Jason reaches New York (actually Toronto) and comes face-to-face with a giant poster of the hockey team with his masked face on it! Pretty groovy, but only for, like, three seconds.If you want gore from a Friday the 13th film, try Jason Lives or The Final Friday (but only the Unrated version) and if you want good plotting and suspense, just stick with the original. If you want all out fun, just go for the newest one, Jason X, which is out to buy from 8 October. That's pretty much all I can say about this one - but give it a go if you want, just don't expect great things."
5,Eight is Great!,"Definately the best fo the series. I don't know about other people but I think it's cool to see the slasher more. This one has the most Jason scenes. Jason walking the streets of new york. The best, go buy it, renting would be a waste of time."
4,3rd Best of the Friday Series,This was the 3rd best. Right behind the original and part 3. This is a good Jason flick. It had alot of funny scenes. 4th best; Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter. Check this out
3,"not too bad, but pretty cheesy","the big killer is still slashing teens, this time new york style. although this movie'splot follows the traditional slasher movie plot, teens go into dark places, have sex, then get sliced, there is something about Kane Hodder who plays Jason, which gives the movie its touch. not too great, but good for starters."
1,"where is the button for ""-5""","Oh no, not an other Friday the Thirteenth movie. How many are there now, I think the number is innumerable.-Sometin' Kool"
2,Degrades the name of Jason Voorhees,"This film was terrible! The plot was completely horrible (if there even was one.) With the title ""Jason in MANHATTAN"", you would think some of the movie would be in NY. Only about 20 minutes is in NY, the rest is on a boat. The only good things about the movie was the fact of seeing future stars like Kelly Hu(The Scorpion King),and Ken Kirzinger who is the stunt coordinater of the film and was thrown through a mirror or window by Jason. Interesting enough he is playing Jason this summer in Freddy vs. Jason. Don't buy this movie! buy any other movie from the Jason Voorhees line."
1,"JASON TAKES MANHATTAN....,THEY SHOULD'VE JUST CALLED IT FRIDAY THE 13th: TITANIC","This has got to be the most S*~^est Movie ever. It completeley ruined the Friday the 13th Series!Jason did not have Hair and was deformed as a ChildHe was on a Boat for most of the Movie, and appeared in New York at the End!Why the Hell did Jason turn back into a Boy at the End, when he Melted in the Toxic WasteJason's Face is just F$""#ing Stupid at the End. I mean Seriously. He looks like Zippy from F$""#ing Rainbow. Why did they even make it?"
1,TERRIBLE like them all,"At least there was a new change of scenery in this F13 installment. You don't have the 80s campy feeling, but there is still teh same old terrible acting, horrible plot, but this time JASON CAN TELEPORT to different places!i give it a surprisingly good 1.4/10"
3,It's so bad it's good!,This film is so friggin bad that I found myself enjoying it. I reccomend this if you want to watch something to laugh at.
4,"Jason Leaves Crystal Lake, and Heads Toward New York!!!","It's cool how Jason Voorhees comes back and climbs aboard a huge ship full of graduate students heading to New York and has a massacre on the ship. At least it's different from the teens staying at an abandoned house and having sex, then Jason shows up. The main star named Rennie, her boyfriend, some teachers, and a boxer survive the boat trip from hell, but now they must survive New York...and Jason. It turns out that Rennie had been to Camp Crystal Lake and and was almost killed by Jason when she was a child. I always thought it was funny when Jason breaks the boombox and gets the punks angry and Jason shows them his real face and they all run away...that's hilarious! If you love Jason and New York, you'll love FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN!!!"
2,CANT BELIVE THEY WASTED MONEY ON MAKING THIS MOVIE,Iv seen all of the Friday the 13th videos. And I have to say that this one is the absolute worst one they have ever made. I cant believe they wasted time and money and making this film. So if your looking for a movie to sleep through than this would be one. If not please dont even waste your time.
4,"Stands out beyond any ""Friday"" movie!!","This is the only Friday the 13th movie most people remember. It's not the same old thing over and over again like the previous 7. The action is much more exciting and obviously more expensive. This is one of the classic horror movies of the 80's. If your going to buy any of the Friday the 13th movies, I recommend this one first."
1,Run from this movie like Jason's talling you...,"Ok, it's hard to keep a series going up to number 8, but sometimes you gotta know when to quit. Jason in New York city??? What is this??? SUCH a deception! DO NOT see this. PLEASE!! END"
2,Could have been better,"First off,they said Jason Takes Manhattan,did they?I liked the movie but should've been more time in NY/Vancouver then on the ship.One of the weakest of the series."
2,Jason Takes Manhattan?,"Wow lets take a breath for a second. Now the thought of Jason in Manhattan sound quite interesting, but until you see it, now thats a whole new story. First of all this movie mostly takes place in a ship where most of the characters die off, then you got some the worst acting out of the series, but nothings as worse as Jason x in the acting category. The story is as simple as the title names it. A group of teens are set sailing to The Big Apple along with a deadly passenger unknown to the teens , and well you get the picture. Now I must give some credit to the writers on account that theres a girl that relates to jason in a way, the deaths in this film are pretty good, and the gore is also quite good. This isnt very bad, i mean ive seen bad and ive seen worse but definitly is one of the worst in the trilogy."
2,The worst Jason movie,"I give it a 2.5 out of 5, the title is misleading, most of the movie took place in a boat, only a small amount was spent on Manhattan, some scenes were good, but overall it failed as a Jason movie, don't waste your money on this, you will regret it, it doesn't even feel like a Jason movie"
3,"""Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"" (1989)","""Friday the 13th, Part VIII"" is in fact one of the better films of the series. There is a complex plot, with some reasonably good acting and a dash of suspense here and there. Could have been better if Jason and co. spent more time in New York City (only 20 minutes of film), as this is the best part of the movie by far. Much better than ""Part V"", ""Part VI"" and ""Part VII"", but can't live up to the brilliance of the first four films. ""Part VIII"" brings a shine to the series that should have ended in 1984, but I think Jason should have been laid to rest before ""The Final Friday"" came into production in 1993."
2,"A movie that if you miss, don't worry!",A complete waste of film.It seems that Jason will never die.If they make a part 9 I will shoot myself. The plot of the story is so blown way off track.Die Jason Die!
5,the series could've gone with dignity...,had it ended with this conclusion when the series was at its peak the series could've gone out with some dignity rather than have part 9 made which just ruined the whole setup...this was a dark film made in 1989 which was the perfect setting. parts 7 and 8 had the series at its peak and should've been the perfect conclusion.
1,Absolute rubbish!,"So far I have been able to ""stomach"" the prequels and sequels that Friday the 13th has produced. The slasher flick is now at it's lowest peak. The plotline is of course routine....after drowning in Crystal Lake once and for all, Jason is accidentally resurrected by an anchor thrown down by a loveboat! The producers wanted to make a change in this film, they wanted to change the scenery. Camp Crystal, the original setting of all the killings has now become quiet because Jason is on his way to Manhattan! He makes his way onto a ship from the boat he travels on and so slaughters the teenagers on the boat one by one. it is up to those remaining in Manhattan to stop him once and for all. Terrible plot, poor acting, and a boring film overall. Do not invest your money in renting or buying this video whatsoever!"
1,Argh!,"I am a big Friday fan, but this film was, quite simply, awful. Definitely not in the mold of the best Fridays. And WHERE is the gore! The MPAA were so damn harsh with the Friday series after Number 1, and it's a shame. I have to give credit for that boxing match with Jason though, and that guy's head flying off with one punch. Nice. Other than that, this is a pile of bunk. Go and rent Part 4, or Part 6."
1,Friday the 13th part 8- Jason takes the bomb,I am a fan of Friday the 13th. I realy am. This movie ranks among one of the worst movies I have ever seen.- The acting is pretty bad- Jason teleports- Bad directing- Dumb kills- Bad movie
4,i don't know why this movie gets so much bad thoughts,"i think this is a very good movie. the acting is very good,shocking huh. this is not the worst entry. i think jason goes to hell is. the killing scenes are very good. like the hot rock in the stomach, drowning the teacher in toxic waste, and knocking the boxers head off into the garbage. this is not as bad as people say it is. it is one of the better ones in the series."
1,JASON TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORST,"Im a huge friday the 13th fan and i love the first 7 instalements, which is the only reason i got this dvd cause i wanted to whole series with no holes, but i definitly didnt get it for the film, it stinks, jasons make-up is the worst of all the films he looks like a scooby doo version of jason, the ending of the film is ridiculous and makes no sense , where part 9 jason goes to hell couldnt even pick up on where this one leaves off which was the first time that happend in the franchise, The kills are unoriginal and not very bloody at all, and since when did crystal lake join up with the ocean its terrible, the only reason to buy this dvd is the special features. I give it one star for improving on the packaging."
1,"This Is The Worst Friday The 13th Film, Ever!","I can't stand this one at all. It's just so boring, and the death count is too high. Usually, when there are less people, the movie is longer and scarier, too. But this one just fails, to be good. The effects are terrible, and the film is worse than Part VII. I wouldn't suggest somebody to rent this if they're bored. This one should have never been made at all.The acting is bad, and Charles McCulloch is boring to listen to. That would be Rennie's uncle.The thing I don't understand at all is, how did Jason's clothes get replaced, after being ripped to shreds in Part VII? Because the directors, and film workers didn't know what they were doing.All I can tell you is, ""do not rent this one!"" Trust me. It sucks."
1,"Only question left is which is worse, this one or Part 5?","Absolutely horrendous, I can't pick which was worse, this one or five...the only thing about this flick that was semi-good is Kane Hodder's performance as Jason Voorhees...(It's surprising how tough it is to act as the killer in a slasher flick)...But even the stuntman extraordinaire Hodder's performance wasn't enough to salvage this flick...Don't see it; the next movie in line, Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday doesn't even acknowledge this one,it completely disregards ""Manhattan""s ending...again, don't see this one. Take my word for it. Don't waste two hours of your life watching it. You'll be sorry if you do. Your time would be better spent cleaning your bathroom."
1,Should have been titled: Jason Goes On A Trip,"Following the particular trend of mediocrity, this film is that and more. Praise them for letting him out of Crystal Lake after 7 films but...in Freddy vs Jason they made him out to be scared of the water, but in here he swims. He swims from the boat to Manhattan, which is contradictory in that if he was drowned then he should be scared not being an olympic swimmer all of the sudden. The killings were laughable and like I said, it don't make sense in that you make the title him in Manhattan and he spends more time in the sewer than the landscapes of N.YAlso, the scene where the boxer punches him like 10 times is possible the worst killing in the Jason franchise."
3,"Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, READ ON!!","If you have made it to this film, hopefully you have watched the others. Not going to write a whole lot, I liked the film. The big part for me that gave it a hard turn was the ending.Pros+Kane returns as jason!+Good Kills+Good Story+Fun filmCons-Terrible ending (spoiler**I mean the very very ending where jason dies. Not the toxic in the sewers but when he turns back into a child??!! I hated that)Again, this is still a good/fun film and glad to own it."
4,a pretty good sequel,"I liked this film in some ways and hated it in many ways too. The first part that bothered me was that it didn't take place at Camp Crystal Lake. It mostly took place on a boat to Manhatten.(they didn't spend too much time in Manhatten.) The second part that bothered me was that when Jason came back as a kid, he had hair. Isn't that wrong? He didn't have hair as a kid, I remember! I also didn't like the characters in the film. When they got to Manhatten, the movie just seemed to have no end. Jason kept coming back and then comiong back which is cool, but it got boring. I liked the movie only cuz Jason was in it and I like his style!"
4,"Different, but...","They cut down on the gore in this installment, but still the body count is high. The movie works fine as a nightmarish chiller. Jason continues his rampage, but this time the story is not set in 'Crystal Lake' (Thank God for that!) but on a cruise ship named ""Lazarus"" (Hmmm...). 1/2 hour later everyone is running about in New York's dark alleys & sewers.The cinematography is well done, unfortunately the plot starts losing it's way in the end & leaves you stupified...."
2,Jason takes Manhattan and the look of the muppets.,"I don't like the whole ""away from Crystal Lake' concept. I want my backwoods psychopath back! Part 8 is descent but it clearly lacks the things that made the originals good and the slasher formula, set by the earliest in the series, is gone. Still Kane's back as Jason and there is a pretty good number of kills. Oh, i almost forgot. Jason has the worst makeup job in this film. He looks like he's crying for the Muppets, but they were on Broadway while he was chasing this girl for no apparent reason."
3,Decent,Decent sequel has a weird title because the movie takes place on a boat where Jason kills teens and then arrives on the streets of New York. The plot is well written but the boat plot dosen't make the movie convincing since fans wanted to see Jason in New York.The Storyline/Plot:A bunch of teens aboard a boat and travel to New York and then Jason kills them and then some arrive to New York.This is a decent movie but the reason this gets 3 stars is because the MPAA cuts the bloody murders and leaves the movie looking mostly bloodless.
3,This show is getting too modern,"Do you remember the original 4 Friday the 13th movies? They each had a new plot, with no background music, acceptable suspense for the time period, and a Jason that could the directors could actually use. Don't get me wrong; Kane Hodder is THE BEST except for the fact that the new director doesn't know how to use him. He is shown with music that is out of its culture, and because of that, as well as the bright color in the scenes, Jason isn't scary.Adding to the movie's bad scenes are the beginning and the time when they're on the boat, which is for way too long, judging from the fact that the title states that Jason goes to Manhattan, which is so poorly illustrated as the star setting. I also think the transition from Crystal Lake (which didn't even seem like it was the camp) to New York's gangs, subways and such are just dumb.Go ahead and watch it, but be prepared for disappointments following the killing scenes."
1,Tied between the 5th one as the worst Friday Film Yet!,Don't watch it!It looks like the budget was $0.10!Don't buy it!
3,Not bad,Perhaps one of the most hated movies of all-time has Jason Voorhees who secretly sneeks on to a boat on its way to Manhattan for some kind of high school thing. The janiter on the ship is like Crazy Ralph from the first 2! When the survivors get of the ship in to a life boat they sail to the Big Apple! Then you see drug addicts in the streets and tons of stuff from the 80's. Then Jason tracks them down...
2,Bad Title For This Film,"Dont bother thinking the title ""Jason Takes Manhatten"" will make you think this film is about Jason in New York! The title should have been ""Jason Goes To Manhatten...Eventually""!Jason is yet again back and boards a run down cruise ship with a bunch of teenagers heading on a feild trip to New York...why Jason boarded the ship is anyone's guess? But he does, he does his typical stalking and slashing aboard the ship! Most of the movie takes place on the ship! Then for about the final 10 minutes of the movie a few of the members on the ship have managed to make it to New York alive. And Jason has followed. Its over the top, unbeleivable, the story is stupid and ending will leave you thinking ""what a load of ****""!If your intrested in seeing it, Rent it first if you can? I'd only buy it if it was cheap as chips or wanting the whole F13th collection and needed it for the set! Other wise its just not worth while!"
4,Another Excellent Sequel,"Part 8 along with Part 6 is another sequel that tops the series in my opinion. In this movie you have a new idea that ends up making a successful sequel unlike Part 7. Jason Takes Manhattan is a good twist to the series. Even though Part 8 doesn't take place in Manhattan until the 2nd half of the movie the plot still holds up. Just as you saw Jason get chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake in Part 6, Part 8 starts off with Jason chained down to the bottom of Cystal Lake which is part of why Jason Takes Manhattan should have been the next sequel after Jason Lives in the series. As in Part 6, there are some characters that you care about and some that you don't. Plus, there is something about Jason that you don't get to see in the previous sequels but I won't spoil that for anyone. As of Part 5 and 7, do yourself a favor by skipping Part 9: Jason Goes to Hell and watch Jason X."
2,BRIEFLY THAT IS...,"First of all, the title is misleading. Due to budget restrictions, Paramount wouldn't let them film a lot in the Big Apple, so Jason's only in Manhattan for about twenty minutes of the movie.The rest of the time he takes to slaughtering students on a graduation trip on one of the student's father's ship. It's all more of the same formula which was definitely getting tired by this 8th installment. There's little suspense and veteran character actor Peter Mark Richman looks embarrassed to be involved. The least entertaining of the eleven films to be sure."
1,Its so bad its laughable!,"By far the worst Friday ever. What is this piece of trash. This movie looks like it was made for TV and the acting is down right embarrassing. Who picked these people. Why is Jason away from Crystal Lake. And whats up wiyh him turning as a boy again. Simply atrocious. I have this one in forsake that I am a huge Friday Fan,but this was completely unneccasary. Part 8 makes Parts 6 and 7 look like masterpieces. Don't reccommend it stick with the first 5. Jason goes to Hell was an improvement but not much. This is a comedy. 1/2 a star."
1,Friday the 13th Part VIII(8):Jason takes Manhattan(Or is it Vancouver?),"If you thought Part 7 was a NEW LOW for the Friday the 13th Franchise,you thought wrong. Here Jason is the Skipper taking a Cruise(That's one Huge Lake!)somehow he forgot to pay his way so he kills everyone in sight(Although He doesn't kill anybody on the Streets of nyc Unless you count the part where he becomes a Hero!) So Jason also Boxes in this movie and apparently morphs into a child and back,count the bad acting and editing and you have one of the lousiest Jason Films along w/part 7 and Of Course Jason X!"
1,"The Worst in the ""Friday the 13th"" Series of the series","If not for the travesty that is Jason X, this would be the worst movie in the series. I tend to not give movies 1 star ratings because there's usually something redeemable in every movie. No, not this time. Everything in this movie is bad, the acting, the plot, the script, the ""fauz"" location, even though I know why more of the movie didn't take place in New York. Even the ending was terrible.I can't say that I recommend this movie to anyone. The Friday the 13th buffs may even want to pass on this one."
1,Another weak sequel,"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan is my least favorite one in the series. Not because there's a lack of gore(the deicapation of the boxer on the roof is hilarous), not because we don't see any boobies( Jensen Dagget is very hot) but because the film is barely set in New York. I think the film should have stayed on the cruise ship the entire time because we only spend maybe 20 min in NY which in acutal fact is Canada."
4,Is Manhattan Ready Jason?,I think this is one of the best Friday's yet. jason's back and this time he's taking on the big apple.if there any place that can handle Jason its manhattan. As he stroll through the streets of New York doing his thing.you'll love this movie.
5,"Decent, and highly underrated!","THE STORY: Two teens in a loveboat set the anchor to make love. But the achor scrapes on a giant cable, witch is next to the defeated Jason. He gets revived, kills the teens, and boards a boat heading to New York.MY THOUHTS: Although a bit cheesy, this is one of the better Friday flicks. Some nice gore, cool kills, and the fact that Jason goes to NY makes this work watching.SIDE NOTE: **SPOILERS**A lot of people are wondering how the hell toxic waste could turn Jason into a little boy again. Well, it didn't. The boy was another of Rennie's hallucinations. Jason washed out to sea, along with his slightly melted mask."
2,How is Jason Taking Manhatten?,"This movie is a continuation of the Friday the 13th series, and I must say on that could be left out. In the begining you get excited by the title Jason takes Manhatten, this is an interesting idea, how could it not be, well I think they found a way. JAson is brought back to life after an underwater power line electrically rechares him and he re-awakens. This is where the movie gets bad, instead of having Jason terrorize Manhatten, they deciede to let him terrrorize a cruise ship of students that are graduating from high school who are embarking on their senior trip. At no point in time does Jason even attempt to take Manhatten. The only reason I give this movie two stars is because Jason at least seems to keep up to his old tricks of maiming and killing teenagers who are doing things that they should'nt. Only see this movie to keep up with the Friday the 13th series. Out. END"
4,Not that bad,This film is pretty good except Jason spends more time on a ship than in NY. Outstanding preformance by Kane Hodder
3,NYC cliche,"Continuing the myth that NYC is nothing but a den of seedy drug dealers, gang bangers and nasty natives, this film does inject a little humor into the typical slasher fare. I love the scene on the rooftop between Jason and the boxer. ""Take your best shot,"" and BAM Jason knocks his block right off and into a garbage can! Keep an eye out for future X-Men Kelly Hu (Lady Deathstrike) as a coke-snorting high school snob! Too funny."
3,Jason takes NY!,"Tired of being stuck at Camp Crystal Lake, Jason decides that its time to go on vacation as he hitches a ride on a cruise ship and heads for New York.Despite its title, Jason only spends about 20 minutes in the Big Apple (well, it's actually Canada). The scenes in New York are actually real good but the wait gets sort of tired as you get to watch him go through a bunch of victims including a geek with a movie camera, a slutty teenager (surprise!), and the boat's own staff. V.C. Durpee as the class boxing champion and token black character is real good and makes for some pretty memorable scenes. Also look for a young Kelly Hu (The Scorpion King) in a small role."
3,GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST,"I have seen this movie a year ago and i like it because it was gory enough.but the story [is bad].The best friday's are 3,4,6,7.If you are real fun of the series dont miss this movie."
2,Manhattan??????????????,"Who knew that Crystal Lake in Ohio, drained into the Atlantic Ocean? I sure didn't! Too bad the writing is bad and the gore is missing thanks to the Motion Picture Association of America. At least its not Urban Scream Last Summer."
2,Worst one in the series!,"Whoever thinks this film is the best in the series probably hasnt seen the rest of the films. This subtitle for this movie was""Jason Takes Manhatton"" but they are only in manhatton for about the last 15 min and most of that takes place in the sewer. The first 80 mins of this piece of garbage takes place in a ship where jason takes out the crew one by one leaving a small amount of survivors that he stalks once in manhatton. Very little blood and gore in this one folks. Rated R for mild violence and partial nudity"
3,"Less bloodiest of the ""Friday The 13th"" series","The violence in this one is not dipicted in graphic detail like in part 9, and deffanantly not like in part 1 and 4."
2,"Not really bad, but the worst one.","Also this Friday the 13th-sequel ain't really bad, but it's doubtlessly the worst one. The beginning is great: When Jason stalks and slashes another bunch of teenies on a cruise ship you think that this is gonna be another exciting sequel. But then the ship thinks and the rest of the story takes place in New York City. Well, in fact that was what I was looking forward to, but there the whole thing gets rather boring. Still, it would be pretty good, if it were not for the totally ridiculous ending. Anyway, as a Friday the 13th fan you should watch it, just because of the well-done beginning. And because of Jason, though he is less scary in this flick."
1,0 STARS: Friday the 13th Part VIII- Jason and his movie becomes GARBAGE!!,"The idea of Jason going to New York City is just stupid. This movie does not even resemble the previous Friday the 13th movies because it does not take place near Camp Blood or Camp Crystal Lake.Therefore, any Friday the 13th theme left in this series is extinguished and the curse of Camp Crystal Lake, which provided somewhat of a creepy atmosphere, is not even utilized rendering this flick meaningless and just plain stupid. Of course, this is a masterpiece compared to ""Jason X"", just to let you know how bad that one is.Friday the 13th part 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the most entertaining of the series with part 2 and 3 being the absolute best of the lot."
2,crap,boy does this movie ever stink. What a sad chapter to this series. Its only slightly better than jason X...
5,Sheds light on many common family problems,"Are you a parent having trouble understanding your kids? Are you having trouble understanding your parents? This book may not reflect your unique problems, but will shed light on problems encountered in many families from which you can draw conclusions about your own problems. Best of all it does it in an easy-to-read, almost novel-like approach without all the big word, professional type verbage found in many psychology texts. You'll see how each player in the family, even the one who seems most innocent, is working to manipulate things to their liking -- sometimes consciously, sometimes not."
4,therapist recommended,"I read this book because I am going through therapy to help me deal with a lot of issues related to my divorce and work. My therapist recommended it. It generated several things for us to talk about in therapy. There is value in it even for those not going through therapy as it helps you look at issues that may come up in your family from a different point of view. It can help you dig a little deeper to figure out what is going on in your own family when there is a problem that seems to be caused by one thing, but might really be caused by something else."
5,Rocked my World!,This book literally rocked my world. It was recommded by my psychotherapist and proved to be so incredibly helpful in understanding the multi-generational shaming process passed down through my family. I now have the courage to ask my family to stop spapegoating and judging me! And to simply accept responsibility for their own issues.
5,Family in Therapy,"Awesome book about family therapy. Am studying for Masters in Family Therapy so this is perfect vicarious way to look behind the scenes (inside the therapists heads) as they enter disjointed world of the subject family. They share what they are feeling, thinking and why they do what they do. An excellent example of whatworking with a co-counselor is supposed to be like. Dynamics of all the Relationships exposed in easy to follow honest terms."
3,"Old book, still valid in many areas","We used this book in a MFT class recently at UCCS and I found it to be quite insightful in understanding the dynamics of family systems. The book covers one family through a long therapuetic process. Even though this book was written in the early 1970's and has a few outdated techniques, the scope of therapy, witnessing the impact of illuminating family-of-origin issues and having an intimate view of the personal agony therapy forces people to work through was very educational from a student counselor perspective."
3,Rodelinda CD order,"Received the CDs and found a problem on the third CD and returned the set. My replacement came within two days.Service was great, the CDs didn't live up to the live performance I attended in San Francisco."
1,Quotes,The book was just a bunch of quotes either said or about Queen Victoria. I sent it back without even reading it.
5,A Great Introduction to Pizzicato 5.,"Sweet Pizzicato Five was released as an import and not an American release. In some of my other reviews, I said that new listeners should check out the American releases first over some other works. This album is quirky and fun like most P5 works and definitely Car-Worthy. Lots of fresh meat. The repeated tracks are kept to a minimum on this album which is welcome and it clocks at 55 minutes. To me, anything under 60 minutes is worth disclosing in a review. Generally speaking, a good album for the collectors and the casual listeners as well."
2,Somebody please kill Axel!,"I absolutely hate this movie. I was hoping that Tom would butcher Axel. Axel is kind of an annoying jack a$$! From the start of the film, he was being a jerk about Tom for no reason. What a stupid and borish plot!"
2,Yet another holiday horror movie,"It's all John Carpenter's fault. Following the success of ""Halloween"", everyone wanted to jump on the band wagon and as a result, the horrors fans of this world were offered a horror movie for every occasion: ""Friday the 13th"", ""April Fool's Day"", ""Graduation Day"", ""Happy Birthday to Me"" etc. ""My Bloody Valentine"" is the Valentine's Day horror movie. In this film, someone is killing the residents of a small mining town because they want to hold a Valentine's Day dance on the anniversary of a mining accident and a massacre that occurred around 20 years earlier. If you've seen any of the ""Friday the 13th"" films, then there's not much new here, but if that's the sort of thing that you like, then this film isn't too bad, although there aren't any real scares in it. The ending is left open for a sequel, but presumably this film wasn't all that successful at the time it was made, because as far as I am aware there wasn't a ""My Bloody Valentine 2""."
2,"""HOOSIERS"" slasher style...","this movie is part Canadian soap opera and part effective slasher movie. The plot is a ripoff of THE PROWLER, or vice versa (either way, the prowler is a MUCH better movie, go see that instead). It deals with a vengeful wraith promising to spree if a valentine's party is ever held after a tragic holiday party-to-blame accident in a coal mine left one survivor to resort to cannibalism and unemployment. Of coarse you know them crazy kids go and party anyways. Basically, anything to do with the killer miner or the mine itself is great, but everything else is just plain tacky. John Stanley of the Creature Features guide gave it 4 stars...I've decided that anything he says is good is automatically bad. I can't believe that a Band actually decided to ripoff this particular piece of pop culture to sell records. Its not because they were on drugs but because they were in the imagination-less state of NOT doing drugs."
2,"""Coal Miners Daughter"" meets ""The Prowler""","Overall, ""My Bloody Valentine"" is one of the early 80's horror movies that just doesn't deliver the goods. You've got a killer running around who the audience doesn't really care about because your not supposed to know who it is, a bunch of ugly, fat, older 20's somethings with bad accents that as characters are neither appealing or worth caring about, and some cheap special effects that just don't do the trick.The movie plays as a ""who-dun-it"" which is probably it's biggest setback. It's not worth trying to figure out who the killer is when all of the possibilities are badly acted and characters without much development. This would have played much better as a straight ""rampant psycho kills horny teenagers"" film.The special effects arent all that great either. Gimme some hot babes running around the forest any day over these hillbillies trudging through the coal mines.Disappointing."
3,A good waste of time....,This movie is a filler in between your horror movie marathon. The movie is about some crazy guy who is killing all the old people that work at the mine and in the town. What got me about this movie was the intensity of the last 20 minutes. It's great fun and you get all your stupid characters that are not developed at all. One of the major downfalls on this movie is the acting. there were two good actors in the film. The survior and the old guy with glasses. So if you are having a marathon put in toward the end of it but not before Slumber Party Masacre:)
2,Deleted scenes can't be watched as part of the film as it states on the back cover,"I am glad to see the deleted scenes after hearing about them for years,BUT I am mad as hell because you can't watch the deleted footage as part of the film as it states on the back cover of the dvd!! If anyone knows how you can PLEASE let me know!!"
4,works better than it should,"ok i like horror movies and i like slashers movies and even if this is a low-buget slasher it works very well. the cast is unknowens so it gives you the feeling that any of them could die at anytime,and that helps. plus the guy in the mine suit with the pix-ax is very scarey. give it a try."
4,Bloody,"My Bloody Valentine is another movie where a group of young people are at the mercy of a maniac. The movie starts in a mining town, where twenty years earlier, a sole survivor of a cave-in kills a couple of men responsible for the accident. In the present day a group of miners throw a Valentine Day party (it has been &#65533;canceled&#65533; for many years) and one by one partygoers are killed. As the movie climax&#65533;s we discover who the murder is!My Bloody Valentine was another one of those slasher movies made in the wake of Halloween and Friday the 13th but with the atmospheric portrayal of the mining town and some of the gruesome acts &#65533; its is a good movie!"
2,IT'S CUT!,"Great slasher from the 80s, but since the narrow-minded suits at Paramount refuse to release the uncut version on VHS or DVD, I'd stay away from it, quite frankly."
5,"roses red, violets blue, one is dead, here's my review","i had no idea how bloody this film was intended to be. even harder to believe is how long it took to see it. paramount, who seems to be more corporate and tame than disney, didnt want to take on the responsibility of putting this gem together so thank god they licensed it to lionsgate. if MBV had been distributed independently in 1981 it definitely would have been more succesful. this uncut version compares to ""the prowler"" in brutality and makes friday the 13th look edited for telivision. and to think i liked MBV when it didnt have a single drop of blood in it...a must see."
5,"A Very Good Edition, and Now A Tradition For Valentine's Day!!!","If you are looking at this product, you most likely know about the film's plot. So, I am not going to bore you with a long synopsis. Here's what I will say. This blu-ray release was amazing. The picture was great, one of the best I have ever seen. The special features are really good too, you have a couple of really interesting featurettes. I personally got this used at FYE for $5, for that price, it was great. First time seeing the film, I am now making it a Valentine's Day tradition. If you want a horror classic, that will thrill you to the core, watch this film, and most definitely buy this Blu-ray release!"
5,My It's A Bloody Good Time!,"Man, My Bloody Valentine is a bloody good time. They have a lot of blood in the movie, so if you a fan of bloody films then this is the bloody one for you. It's like they just keep pouring on the blood. Man, and it looks so real too. I have heard a rumor that the bloody blood, was real blood. That bloody heart .. yuck man ... The bloody axe, whoo.. And the bloody chicks are soo hot in this movie. So, see this movie before I slash you with my pick axe."
2,Halloween and Friday the 13th spin off...,"These horrific events began 20 years ago in the small mining town, Valentine's Bluff, when some miners got trapped in the mines and their rescue got delayed due to a Valentine's day party. The only survivor sought his revenge a year later by killing everyone who was celebrating Valentine's day. Now the curse is about to be brought back as the people of Valentine's Bluff are preparing for their first Valentine's day party in 20 years. My Bloody Valentine is a poor slasher film that seems to be a spin off from Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980), which offers an awkward cinematic experience."
2,Rehashed slasher trash!,Yet another (groan) early 80's slasher flick about a guy in a gas mask chopping his way through many a stupid victim on Valentine's day! Hallfay through this film I had already lost complete interest in it!!! Dont waste your time or money!
2,mbv old school.,i owned this movie for a month when it was first released. it kept making a clicking sound in my dvd player so i had to take it back for a refund. this dvd is too thick for some dvd players.
2,Happy holiday!,"20 years ago, there was a terrible accident in the mine on Valentine's Day. The following year one of the miners, Harry Warden, takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident. Since that day, there is no celebration of Valentine's Day in the little town Valentine's Buff. Until now (that is 1981). But Harry Warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration.The music as music is quite good, but it doesn't lead the film in any direction, so it's not helping. The story is recycled, which is good, but could have been much more minimalistic. Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids? And trying to put a twist to the story by ""explaining"" things is seldom very helpful. The murderar places human hearts in Valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary.A variation on the holiday theme, that could have been a bit more focused."
3,BLEEDING HEARTS,"One of the many slasher films that followed in the footsteps of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH, MY BLOODY VALENTINE is an effective little thriller, filled with impending doom and a dark sense of humor. Buoyed by a relatively unknown cast, the movie follows the denizens of Valentines Bluff, a sleepy little town that lives in the shadow of a demented killer. The town hasn't had their annual Valentine's Party in 20 years and now that they've planned to restart, seems like there's a killer out there who isn't too keen on the idea. The movie has some surprising moments and considering the deluge of slasher films of this time period, it's a little bit above average."
3,Watchable,"A small town is planning to hold its first ever Valentine's Day dance after so many years. A man in a miner's outfit tries to prevent the town from holding the dance at all costs--even if it means murder. As a result, the town cancels the dance; however, several teens plan to hold a dance of their own near a local mine.The acting is average, and so is the dialogue. The special effects during the murder scenes are good though. This is an average film that is good for passing time; some people might enjoy this film. I think this could've been a better film if there weren't so many cuts made to it."
5,A classis 80's slasher flick...,"Let me start by saying (in case anyone is listening) that, I WANT THIS FLICK on DVD (Unrelated: It blows my mind that so much trash is on DVD today, and ""more important"" - read: for nostaglia purposes -flicks remain unreleased)!. That said, this flick scared the pants off me in the theatre in the 80's, and it's just as much ""fun"" to watch as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Cahinsaw, and Elm Street. Some reviewers have really thrown 'Bloody Valentine' out with the trash, but I completely disagree, and stress that it's a true slasher flick that deserves its' place in with the other, more famous, flicks listed above. Come on... How can you argue with: human hearts in candy boxes, a creepy coal mine setting (hats off to the infamous scooby doo mysteries), and a serial killer dressed in his mining best - complete with head lamp and pick axe! A truly recommended 80's gem! I loved this flim!!"
4,Hope Lionsgate does it right...,"By special edition, I hope that means more than just the trailer tacked on. Paramount dropped the ball when they released theirs (as usual i.e. Friday the 13th). The famous six minutes of MPAA cut footage was discovered years ago and for some reason, no one wants to show it.This isn't a bad film for early 80's slasher kind. And boy, those decorations in that town were really into it. Ever find a town where decorations were even put on dryers in the local laundromat?? I can rate the film as it is for what we've seen previously but let's find out what Lionsgate means by special edition. If they're smart, they'll do it justice."
1,WORST DVD I'VE EVER PURCHASED,"I just purchased this DVD because the store was partically giving it away (9.99) and let me say I still feel cheated. This movie is your typical clone,lets make a movie about a holiday(Valentines Day) and cash in on it. First its got your typical crazy man just like crazy Ralph in Friday The 13th and also has a guy wearing a mask(a miners mask to be exact)and it uses the same theme as the prowler(another ... film,but I won't go there),its about a guy Harry Walden who has been decieved on Valentines Day left in a mine and later returns. Not to mention this movie was so cut and edited I would show it to my parents at dinner. Parmount has done another horrible job with another DVD,no extras,not even a trailer. ... ... MOVIE WITH NO PLOT,NO GORE,AND NO EXTRAS,NOT EVEN THE ORIGINAL COVER ART JUST LIKE THE FRIDAY THE 13th FILMS ON DVD,THIS IS AS HORRID AS SCREAM SERIES,I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.,AND VALENTINE(THE [re-make] OF THIS ... MOVIE)"
4,TACKY SLASHER,"This is a very cheesy, yet entertaining slasher. Thank you Paramount for keeping the gore shots out. The movie has some seriously gory and disturbing deaths, but they were edited shorter and Paramount didn't bother with a DIRECTOR'S CUT. The transfer and sound quality were A grade and very much worth the $... price tag. For fans of the Friday the 13th series, you will love this cheesy slash fest which is actually a pretty creepy and original 80's flick."
2,Do not buy!,"The transfer is great, however, the film on blu ray is missing the scene where the girl gets thrown up on the water post after the clothes start falling down. I wonder if all copies miss this scene."
1,"i liked this when young, but boy did it age badly","i liked this one when growing up so when i found it for less than 5 dollars i got it. man did this movie age badly!!!! not scarey not even so bad it's funny , just bad and not one scare to be had. maybe i was drinking when i saw it, or a least i hope i was man what a mess."
5,Even better,"I watched this movie and I must say the remake was not necessary. Even though I enjoyed parts of the remake, this uncut version is the ultimate and only version you need. The added gore has a sort of grindhouse look, as they are grainy but still viewable. The new gore is great and probably the goriest slasher film ever made. I love the movie and it goes in my top ten of best horror films of all time. Must own"
4,Creepy,"My Bloody Valentine is a step, albeit small, above some of the other slasher movies at the time. Sure you have the typical story of the lunatic bent on revenge, but since most of the movie takes place in a mineshaft, well wouldn't you be scared by a psychominer in a gas mask with a pick axe?? I think so. Great movie."
3,A Classic Valentines Month Movie,Someone had to ruin Valentines Day for people who actually have fun dates and enjoy the people their with at parties.
5,Must have for the serious double bassist.,"Audrey Bush, former principal bassist of the Utah Symphony for over 35 years and one of the greatest bassists and teachers ever, has developed this great book of key scale, 3rds, and arpegio fingerings for all twelve keys in both major and minor. Her fingering best practices and recommendations facilitate optimum playing performance and leverage the tonal qualities of the double bass. One of the great things about this book is that it gets students comfortable at a very early stage playing the full range of the bass. Because it follows the circle of fifths, it is also helpful in building a basis for music theory. This book is a must have for every student and professional and a critical part of every practice session. Ultimately, the goal should be to memorize all the fingerings for the scales leverage the fingerings in solos and orchestral works. Thanks, Audrey, for a wonderful tool for great bass playing and for your legacy as a teacher."
5,Quality Ladder,I was looking for a good quality ladder to attach to my dock that was sturdy and would not shake when an adult climbed it. This ladder is exactly what I was looking for.
3,Dont forget to bring in the fenders!,"These are a nice and inexpensive alternative to the velour covers that sell for $50+ each. Problem is, if you let them contact the water under way, they slip right off. Lost 3 of them 1st time my first mate forgot to bring them in."
4,Waste of time,"This game might be the worst game I have ever played. The instruction manual is pathetic at describing controls. The graphics are sub par, and the game truly is boring."
3,Must Have,"This game is great for those who love drag racing, especially the nostalgia cars like the 68 Nova. However the pro style cars in top fuel and funny car are hard to tune to get them down the track. So far my first motor is a 6000 Hp beast that powers my Nova in to the very low 6's (6.236) at 245 MPH."
2,Hmmmm....,"Buy this game if you have alot of patience, because load times are long and this game has a habit of freezing up. You can pick from a number of cars and then totally customize them and build your own engine. You can also make a custom engine and then throw a turbo or supercharger on it. But as far as gameplay goes, well brand new it is [not much money]. That says it all. Any good game will not sell for [that amount] when it is newly released. Would I purchase for [that amount] knowing how the game is? Probally not, I would recommend renting this game, if you can find it for rent. Replay value on this game is pretty low."
5,endless bummer?,"not if you pick up this album. classic bones brigade top notch stuff from what seem's like honest dudes, never saw them i missed out. plus i thought the cover and back art was so cool i got tat's of them! get into it!!!!!"
2,Misleading...,"Don't be deceived by the term ""Rubberized"". The title and pics represented by Boxwave, via the Amazon website, indicate the case for the ipod touch 3rd generation is ""Rubberized"". When in fact it's merely a Jet Black hard plastic shell casing for the ipod touch. It affords no protection in the event the ipod it dropped because it's encased in plastic which would not absorb any impact, as apposed to an rubberized casing which would absorb the impact. The term ""Rubberized"" indicates there is a rubber component to the casing, which is not true, it's simply plastic. Wish I'd known this prior to my purchase !Florida"
5,Best Morgan Heritage concert dvd I've seen so far....,"This is a good one; true reggae collectors should absolutely add this to their collection. Excellent sound and video quality, and an amazing performance by Morgan Heritage. I've seen 2 other Morgan Heritage dvd's (why is it that we can't get some of these OTHER incredible reggae groups to make more of them???), but this is by far the best of the bunch."
1,worked for a short time,"this wall charger worked fine for 3 days. but after the third day, it inexplicably did not work any longer."
1,doesn't work,"Seems like a charger would be a simple device. You wouldn't think that the technology could really be so complicated. Nevertheless, this one does not work. Can't beat the price, yet it is going straight to the trash heap."
5,A great charger for the money,"I bought this charger for my wife's phone and was amazed at how well it performs compared to the OEM charger that came with the phone. IF you are looking for a replacement or an additional charger, definitely give this one a try.I have no issues with the charger, it was delivered on time and the customer service was excellent."
4,Great Price Great Product!,"You can't beat the price on these. I went to the Cingular/AT&T store and they were still charging $30 for these chargers. I am happy overall with the product, they work and that is the most important thing."
1,Poor Materials,"I had one of these for several years, but when I bought the new version the wheels were made of a cheaper material. They wheels were defective and the bag unusable by the end of my first trip. Amazon replaced the bag, but the same exact thing happened again. The bag was unusable after my first trip."
2,Disappointed,"I bought and installed this ""Professional Grade"" valve in June 2011 as a replacement for a similar, but no longer available Rainbird valve. The solenoid/flow control lasted a year and began to leak badly. The old units lasted 3-4 years each (have 5 zones). I just (today) installed a Toro replacement valve (Toro 53763 3/4-Inch Anti-Siphon Jar Top Underground Sprinkler System Valve with Flow Control). So far, I'm impressed by quality & features; although it is only day 1."
1,Leaks,I probably got a defected one. After installing got leaks from three different sources. Tried to fix them but I am afraid that need to replace it. This time from local home depot that way I can exchange it easier.
4,Works well as an advanced AV kit with some free cables.,"It seems that it doesn't work so well as a High def pack and that you should just by the microsoft version. However, I do not have an HD TV and just wanted the S-Video and Digital Optical Audio for Dolby Surround Sound. For this purpose it works great and includes some free cables. 1x S-Video, 1x Standard AV cable, and 1x High Def cable. It does not include an Digital Optical cable but they are easy to find, and it includes more cables than the Microsoft one did.So I would recommend this if you need the dolby sound and better picture, but not if you are looking for HDTV."
4,dont believe the previous posts about this not working,"This product does work, see the problem with people is they dont take time to read directions. What you need to do is hook up these cords correctly and then go into your setting on your xbox and enable it to work on HD for 420,720,1080 it just doesnt automatically work, you need to set it to read HD. Please dont these other posters as complaints, i have a logictech AV pak which the same as this, and at first i got purple a green lines when playing a game in HD, then i read some intructions and fixed the problem, end of issue."
1,Worthless,"This unit is worthless!I connected everything according to the instructions and the XBox will not display properly on my lcd tv. No matter what settings that I use it will not work. My problem is that I have widescreen enabled and it shows up on the tv as a 4:3 image, and it looks horrible.Yes, I did read and follow the instructions... buy the Microsoft version if you need one of these. I found them in CompUSA and Best Buy at a very reasonable price."
1,High Definition DOES NOT WORK!,This product is bogus. It does not enable High Definition use with your XBOX.
2,Horrible router,I have similar problems as described by someone here. I have to disconnect the router often to get on the internet. It would stop working suddenly. Also Netgears' customer service is pathetic. I have been using this router for 2 years now.
4,Netgear RP114 router,"Great router !! But I had a bear of a time getting my Wii to get through this router's firewall. So, four stars for being the fort knox of routers."
2,DNS problem like everyone else,"I bought mine exactly 1 year ago, and I have the same DNS complaints as everyone else. And it seemed to have cropped up after upgrading FIRMware to 1.5 from 1.2 or 1.3 half a year ago. If I am downloading or sharing something large at my max ADSL downspeed/upload, 96/640kbps, DNS failures are very common. And I frequently download from newsgroups, so this is a real issue. I imagine users realtime videa and audio will have the same problem.It is easy to setup and use, and seems to work fine as a LAN router and print server, though I haven't used it much as one. It works fine if I am not maxing my net connection.From the other reports of terrible customer service, I advise anyone to avoid this company if you have a similiarly priced alternative.It is still much than using PPPoeT dialer software that the telco gives you to access DSL without a ADSL router."
5,LOVED IT!,i thought this was pretty funny. i rented it and saw it with my cousins. now whenever i visit them we watch this. i dont know why one of the other reviewers gave this a bad review but trust me....BUY THIS!!
2,Could have been so much better.,"First of all, a list of the XX best/worst of anything is always subjective, but the fact of the matter is, the films on this seem to have been chosen strictly on the basis of the film's public domain status and/or the availability of a trailer from which to pull royalty free clips. Frankly, if this was just a trailer reel, I'd highly recommend it, but it's edited together like any one of the endless VH1 shows of similar title. The only thing missing is the ""funny"" pundits waxing poetically on the subject at hand. (Just try not to get tired of the cheesy linking scene of the crowd throwing stuff at a move screen that is repeated after every movie.)On the plus side, I discovered a few movies I'm going to have to look for now. There was some trivia in there I didn't know. I only paid $3 but I'll probably never watch it again."
3,The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made.,"Very funny and very short 50 worst movies countdown. A Quick overview of movies. I find it a bit comical but short, and certainly there are way more than 50 worst movies.and why is Plan 9 number 4?"
3,Good for a rental,"When I first saw this show up on my netflix queue, I figured hey- bad movies are awesome. Why not check it out? It'd be worth a few laughs.I have to say that while I was certainly entertained, I was sort of disappointed by some of the films included in the list. I'm sure that these might be very bad for the people who made the list, but I have to question some of the films that made the list. Howard the Duck is a bad movie but is it really worse than The Final Sacrifice, which wasn't included on the list? My point is that this list seems to be more based on (as another reviewer stated) box office gross & personal preference than actual badness.This is still good but I recommend this as a rental only. Get it via Netflix before you buy it because this doesn't have a lot of rewatch value."
4,Fantastic CD,"I played in several contemporary gospel groups in the 80's, two of them were sort of Imperials ""cover"" bands with the lead singer, Steve Munds, being a very close friend of Russ Taff (Russ produced Steve's solo album).This CD has some of their truly greatest hits, the disco stuff, some old-time gospel, and great harmonies. It is a joy to slip it into the CD player, crank up the amp and let it rip again for old times' sake.This is a 2 disc set, which covers lots of Imperials years. You will not regret it, and will in fact really enjoy the music."
4,Great cassette... cassettes beat MP3,"Cassettes yes, CD;s with GOOD algorhythms... goodMP3... noFirst of all... this is a great tape and collection of a great group. The sound quality was done right in the recording studio. This includes all the Imperials that you remember as their hits. Nuff said."
3,Good for short flights,"The headphones do reduce the noise level on flights. When using the headphones quite an amount of engine noise can still be heard, but it is enough to reduce the ""pressure"" of the amount of sound. However, the headphones are not comfortable for longer periods of time, so I wouldn't recommend them for long flights. I tried using the headphones recently on a flight from LAX to Sydney (about 15 hours), and they were not comfortable enough for using all the time, especially when trying to snooze! On shorter flights they are perfect, reducing the volume of the engines, allowing clear listening to music."
3,A flight without the noise,"I am a very frequent flyer mostly long international flights. I purchased the noise reduction earphones to try and reduce the constant roar of the engines during the flight and to perhaps feel more relaxed when I arrive at my destination. It works, they actually reduce the noise signifantly. I am quite happy with the results. The only negative comments why I did not rate it a 5 star is the method of attachment of the earphone to the head gear is quite fragile and can be broken off easily, but of course they are warranted. I also think the coverage of the earphone over the ear should be more similar to the other brands on the market.."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Somewhat disappointed in the sound quality for this headphone as it didn't do a very good job of filtering out the noise from the aircraft engines on my recent plane trip. As I was sitting away from the engines, I expected better. They are very comfortable, though."
2,Not Satisfied,The headphones came with only one side working.The one side that works made a fairly loudhissing sound when turned on.
3,the work but are not durable or for the big heads,"i bought a pair at a local store in late 2001 for use at work and on occasional airplane flights. they work well. but they press on the earlobe too much to be comfortable without pain for more than 3-4 hours at a time. maybe its my large head or maybe its just these phones.they fold up nicely and include a good travel bag. a pair of rechargable AA batteries in these lasts seemingly forever.regardless, the foam cover on them has completely deteriorated and i can't find anywhere that sells a replacement. bad!pick other headphones with a vynil or velvet liner rather than foam if you'll be using these a lot."
3,On the ground use-driiving a convertible,"As a MIATA (sports car convertible)owner, I find the Koss 2000 unit quite effective in cutting down noise from wind, engine and highway sounds. While they do not eliminate 100% of the noise, the improvement is very noticible and worthwhile.Also, my car radio sounds better than ever. California State law prohibits the use by driver of ""radio"" headphones, but these are not radio."
2,uncomfortable metal bands,"This unit supposedly has a higher db of cancellation so I figured I'd give it a shot.It seemed about the same as the Aiwa and Sony unit. However, what I really did not like about this unit is the metal band that goes over the head. What happens to me is that my hair gets caught in the metal band whenever I slide the headphones over my neck (say when I want to talk to the flight attendants).This unit also seemed more prone to feedback than the other units. This was pretty annoying when you'd try to rest the side of your head against a pillow."
1,Disappointed,I've been disappointed with these:* for the lack of comfort when using on long plane trips* for the not as great sound reduction as expected* because the headphones produce a loud hum when the battery is turned on - which means that it only does its job when the audio range being played is enough to cover the sound of the hum!Don't waste your money... look elsewhere...
1,"Cheap looking, cheap feel.","It's hard to tell by the photos, but it's clear plastic on the sides.The ""brushed aluminum"" looks super cheap.The texture feels cheap as well.It does not complement the iphone 5 at all."
4,Fits. You get what you pay for.,"This case fits the iPhone 5 well and has good fit and finish. However, the material is stiff plastic. It bulks up the edges of the phone and feels plasticky, you immediately notice the difference from the naked phone. If you are used to the more soft-touch cases out there then this one will take some getting used to. If you are a case snob, then spend more money.That said, it works exactly as advertised and I can't fault BoxWave for providing a snug fitting, cost effective case."
5,Gets The Job Done,Its not fancy with a lot of controls and that is what I like about it. Works great for expanding or adding low z inputs for a band.
2,good idea with a bad outcome,"Alot of people refer to Part 7 as ""Jason vs. Carrie"". I can see that. After all, the heroine in this movie has telopathic abliities. Still, as creative as ""Jason vs. Carrie"" could have been, which is why I'm giving it a second star just to be nice, Part 7 proved to be another sequel that went down the tubes especially when compared to the success of Part 6. You get to see the dead version of Jason without the mask at the end of the movie but it's really no big deal. I tried to like Part 7, I really did, but the movie was just somewhat dull. Along with Part 5, I suggest skipping this one and moving on to Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan"
4,Cut classic,"I was 8 years old when my dad worked on this film (Don Cely: Best Boy Electric), but I didn't get to see it until a year later on HBO. My dad was warning me of all the gore that was in it and how they created a couple of the effects (the head squeeze was filled with fake blood and that marshmallow stuff you get in a jar). Then, to our surprise, none of the gore was in it. We were both disappointed, especially since my dad had talked it up so much (mainly so I wouldn't get scared).Anyway, at some point maybe they'll actually release the uncut version. It's well worth the wait."
3,5th best Jason movie.,"When Tina killed her father in Camp Crystal Lake.She is now a teen and travels with her mom and seedy doctor.She fells bad so she tries to bring her father back,instead she brings Jason back.When Jason rises to kill teens that live next door.Tina must battle Jason.This Jason movie is decent but the lack of blood messes up this movie.there is blood here and there.Here's the Pros and ConsPros:Kane Hodder takes the role as JasonJason looks creepier than part 6Cons:Lacks bloodBest Deaths:Jason's hand throw Dan's back.Jason takes Judy's sleeping bag with her in it and bashes her on a tree.Jason crushes Ben's head."
1,Superbly Awful,"The plot is weak at best, let me say more, it's plain awful. A girl with psychic ability against a supernatural force in Jason. Please, I like though how they made Jason into a decayed monster with it's bones being shown but the story line is pathetic. This one should have been axed from production."
3,Great but unedited version would be 100% better,"Watching the movie was good, probably the best ending in the whole series. The death scences make me mad, because they are cut beyond belief and I havent even seen the orignal version! Movie companys are releasing uncut versions of movies left and right these days, so why not release this movie or the whole series uncut for that matter? Until I see this movie uncensored and in full glory, it'll only get 3 stars. Mostly for the last 20 minutes of the film."
3,Begins slowly but has strong ending,"This seventh entry in the Friday the 13th saga finds everyone's favorite unhappy camper Jason Voorhees doing his usual camp business, until he meets his match up against a girl named Tina who has some powerful telekinetic gifts. Yes sir, the story is pretty much Carrie meets Jason, but The New Blood delivers most of the goods that have come to be expected by fans of the series. Also, this installment marks Kane Hodder's debut as Jason, who is arguably the best man to ever don the hockey mask. The kills are nicely done (despite the toned down gore count, you can just tell that there was many a edit here) as many garden tools are implemented, and the girls are nice looking; both of which are staples of the franchise. The climatic showdown between Jason and Tina more than makes up for the slow and predictable first half of the film, and while The New Blood isn't the best in the series, it's still a fun ride nonetheless."
3,"Not the best, Not the worst","I have seen better Fridays in my time, but sure of all this one beats the worst ones. The New Blood is something different in the jason saga, although it reminds me of the Final Chapter a plethora amount,but this one is different. A psychic child kills her dad using mind powers by drowning him in Crystal Lake when she is a teenager all of her guilt rises with her power she ressurects jason from under Crystal Lake by accident and well like always he starts killing a bunch of teens. The story was a little strange and unfamiliar to me, but it rates highly decent in the saga of Friday the 13th. Well in other words i expected a plethora amount worse but it turned out to be pretty good."
4,Jason Lives!....Again!,"Meet Jason Voorhees, a murderous, undead fiend from beyond the grave. Meet Tina Sheperd, a telekenetic, young girl who killed her father. Pit the two against each other in Camp Crystal Lake and you have a GREAT movie! This is a good movie to watch with your friends late at night.....on Friday the 13th, Jason will meet his match."
3,Jason rules in this one,"Jason looks more evil than ever. One of the best entries in the FRIDAY saga since JASON LIVES. Part VII was the first FRIDAY I ever actually owned and the next I plan on owning are parts One, Four and Six. Jason Voorhees is the 2nd best slasher movie anti-hero ever, Michael Meyers obviously being the best. Remember kids.. If you plan on making a slasher movie, remember not to make the killer a wise-cracking one liner wise guy with a cornball sense of humor (ie. Freddy).. silent masked death is always better. that is all."
3,Jason VII (I thought 7 was supposed to be a lucky number),"Friday the 13th Part VII. While this movie joins the many of an already great series, I'd have to say that the only thing The New Blood has going for it is Kane Hodder finally taking the reins as the indestructible Jason Voorhees. He truly breathes malevolence into an already immortal character, but the rest of the movie has very little going for it, except some good-looking girls, and some great death scenes, though I don't quite understand what exactly happened when Jason was defeated in this movie. The makeup for Jason in this movie was exceptional, for it looked as if Jason had been down in the lake for a really long time, with the fish taking bites out of his supposedly dead body. But why didn't he ever seem to dry off in this movie, or in Part VIII? That's why I gave this one such a low rating. If you just love Jason, and are willing to see him at any price, check this one out."
4,definately has a comic book feel 2 it,"this installment of the friday series is one of the better ones since its better than others except 8 and maybe 4 or 6. the story is pretty weak but then again it is a jason movie so what should viewers expect? for a decent jason movie, check this one out only if part 8 is unavailable"
1,THE WORST ONE OF THE ENTIRE SERIES,"IT'S AMAZING HOW ONE SEQUEL CAN BE SO GOOD, BUT THE NEXT ONE IS SO BAD. IN THIS ONE, JASON IS ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT BACK TO LIFE BY A GIRL WITH TELEKINETHIC POWERS, WHICH SPELLS MORE TROUBLE FOR CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. NOW, YA GOTTA ADMIT, THIS WHOLE MOVIE IS BORING, THE ENDING IS REALLY WEAK, AND IT'S JUST BEEN DONE WAY TOO MANY TIMES NOW. I REALLY THINK ALL THE MOVIES THAT CAME AFTER PART 1 WERE DONE STRICTLY FOR MONEY. TO HORROR FANS, I'D ADVISE YOU TO AVOID THIS ONE. AND PEOPLE GOT THE NERVE TO SAY PART 8 WAS WORSE THAN THIS BS, I SERIOUSLY BEG TO DIFFER!"
3,not a great movie,"Kane Hodder plays Jason really well. In my opinion he was the best actor ever to play Jason. It was pretty cool how it showed the insides of different parts of Jason's body and how part of his mask was broken off. Still, this movie could've had a better story. I mean, a girl having powers? It was just kinda cheesy. Although it was pretty funny watching her use them to kick Jason's ass! Anyway, I only enjoyed this movie the first two times I watched it. You won't be able to watch it very many times before getting tired of it."
3,Decent film with the best Jason actor in the series,Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood is by no means a great but it's decent. The producers tie the film to the last sequel pretty good and the whole Jason v.s. Carrie plot is also cool. The film had one really funny death where Jason picks up a lady in a sleeping bag and slams her into a tree.
3,the last watchable friday,wes craven never had anything to do with this series| anyways part VII is the last watchable in the series
3,missing inside mini poster,"it arrive in the mail open it up everything was good, but the mini poster that is in the inside wasn't included i was sad.it was suppose to be new i guess.big dissapointment"
1,Friday The 13th Part VII(7) The New Blood,"Think Ghost Whisperer and the little girl who starts fire Takes on Friday The 13th, Lame Story and acting,one of the worst Friday The 13th Movies(You should see Part 8!) Jason here is not the same scary Jason From Part 3, The movie is utterly boring as well."
3,newbloodreview,"As we all know this movie was something new in the friday the 13th series. The audience was introduced to a girl with telekenetic powers, which in my opinion was not a bad idea. The movie was slow at times, and was not the most exciting of the movie series, but for the most part it was still fun too watch. One thing I also liked about this movie is that there are a couple of characters who the audience can really feel bad for. One of them was Tina's mom, while the other was a sweet, innocent, nerdy girl named Maddy. When I first saw this movie I actually felt bad for this poor girl even if it was just a movie."
4,New blood. Same camp.,This is the first time Kane Hodder played Jason and he somehow gave Jason a kind of personality.This 7th installment was fairly good and this time we have a girl with supernatural powers taking on Jason. (Which was interesting)Most of the teens were normal but this time a girl (Tina) has the ability to move things with her mind. Jason's face is once again revealed and looks worse than ever. Overall a good film.
3,The most erie Jason yet...,"The slasher is back, but this film made the scenario a little different. Starting with a creepy introduction to our hero, Jason, he is brought back by a teenager's telekinetic powers. His ressurection and new appearance makes him scarier than ever. This film has lots of original killing ideas for Jason's victims, and some of them are bloodier than ever. The girl who brought him back must find him and put him away; and she does a pretty good job trying to do so. Jason hasn't met his match, but he has found something to think about. Three stars."
1,"It should have stopped at ""The Final Chapter""","Being the FT13th enthusiast that I am, I can tell a load of crap when I'm faced with it. I give props to Kane Hodder for bringing new depth and dimension as well as undeniable character to Jason, who after being previously portrayed by mediocre actors, just did not have the scariness that he did when he emerged from the water to drag Alice down to his ""resting"" place at the end of the original. The storyline reeked. The whole idea of ""Carrie vs. Jason"" holds about as much water as the long awaited, in the making, yet totally impossible ""Jason vs. Freddy"". Thanks Kane for your effort, but more effort should have been put into the overall story."
1,Enough already!,"As is to be expected, by the time the infamous Jason embarked on his sixth foray into mass murder (remember that the madman’s mother was our murderess in part 1), the concept had grown quite stale. In this episode, a telepathic, telekinetic girl named Tina, who at an early age caused the death of her father by collapsing a pier on which he was standing, moves to Camp Crystal Lake with her mother to try and escape the horrible memories. However, when she arrives, her powers accidentally rise Jason from the watery grave into which he fell in #6. Add in a group of (...)teenagers (staying at the house next door to Tina’s) and you’ve got the classic (read tiresome) “Friday The 13th” formula. The scares don’t work, the dialogue is stupefyingly inane, even for this type of film, and a dumb subplot involving an evil psychiatrist out to exploit Tina is so ridiculous it defies words."
1,PARAMOUNT/BUECHLER SHAFT US AGAIN.,"Once again Paramount has released this severely cut version on home video.THE SLEEPING BAG MURDER IS STILL CENSORED.I saw this movie in the theater in May of 1988.I saw the complete uncut sleeping bag scene.Everyone in the theater screamed like maniacs.It was shocking.It was horrifying.It was THE greatest moment in the Friday series.It was in every release print that played, therefore, It must still exist.By the time the VHS came out, the sleeping bag kill was gone forever.Paramount Pictures. You guys are cowards."
3,The movie that i grew up with,"Hey everyone my name is Ryan Schreiber, i'm 14 and when i was about the age of 6-7 i would go to my grandfathers house and we would watch scary movies, one being my favorites was Jason movies, Micheal Myers, and other ones like Gohls or how ever you spell it. but this one is the one that i grew up with, it has a saucy story line about a girl (Tina) who has telekenisis or however you spell it. And when she was very young she got mad at her father and she killed him using her powers then her mother discovered her powers so she decied to commit her to a mental hostpital, about 13 years later she goes back to vist the place where she killed him. one night she tried to raise him using her powers and she waked the dead and she started a whole lot of stuff. But over all i think it is a good movie. Every kid should be able to watch Jason movies.."
3,JASON VORHEES Meets CARRY WHITE.,"Part VIII, I don't know how this series still lives on. Well, they sure tried something different this time around.Plot: When Jason returns from where he left off in the previous part (which I can't remember), he finds an unexpected guest awaiting him... this young guest happens to have Telekinetic powers (what else!)It's like ""King Kong Vs Godzilla"", but here we have more blood and chaos..."
3,Heavily edited,"As this movie is I'd only give it 2 stars but it has the basis of a good movie and could have been really good if every death scene had not been edited to death so that theres hardly and vioelnce or gore. The death scenes were creative and had the potential to be very good if they were shown in the full.At least the movie tries to be origional by having a psychic character fighting Jason, and the last half hour is good. Overall an average horror movie, that could be great if it was cut to death (no pun intended). Release an un-cut version and i give it 4 or 5 stars."
3,The funniest movie in the series.,"You know, at this point the franchise just couldn't have gotten any worse.No we have a psychic going up against Jason.What is unintentionally the most hilarious movie in the series, we get to see Jason get smacked around by a telekinetic teenage girl.The fights between her and Jason are some of the funniest in Hollywood history.The acting is absurdly bad, the directing is even worse.The music stinks.This movie falls into the category of ""It's sooooo bad, it's good""I recommend part one and two for their masterful presentation.This one, believe or not I'm giving it three stars just because it's so ridiculous, it's fun to watch.Expect to lose a few IQ point by the time it's finished though.A psychic brings Jason back from the dead.GIMME A BREAK!!!!!!!Still........... recommended.Just get ready to laugh and not jump."
5,It was really gory and I was scared the first time I saw it.,"This movie is one of the best FRIDAY films, my fave bit, personally, is where Jason puts the Bushmaster 2000 through Dr Crews's stomach (he deserved it, the bastard)."
1,Rather boring installment...(* 1/2),"Am I the only one who enjoys slasher flicks AND hates this film? Part 7 is just boring. None of the ""Friday..."" movies are actually GOOD, but most of them are at least entertaining! The only good thing I can say about this installment was that Tina was a nice charector, and is one of my favorite ""main girl""s in the series."
2,I can't stomach the sleeping bag scene...,OK. If you want to see a girl get bashed against a tree while in her sleeping bag so that her bones poke through - fine. I'm usually okay with gore - but that was too much. MUCH TOO DISGUSTING...
3,average entry in the franchise..,"first, I am a big fan of the F13 series.in this installment, Jason is resurrected by the mental powers of a gifted teen girl, rising out of Crystal Lake to once again terrorize (and shred) the new crop of campers there.Only this time, he has to do battle with the telekenetic powers of the teen girl, as she fights to survive. She has the ability to move objects, which comes in handy to throw large things at Jason to slow him down.I found that this entry started really slowly, but finally the action picks up in the middle of the film and the ending was better than expected. Jason is un-masked which was a surprise."
4,Horror Movies,"love these movies.i'm a big jason fan(espeacially parts 7,8,9,and 10).kane hodder as jason is awesome."
4,Good Fun out of critical eye.,"Part VII is a good entry in the series. To be honest the first time I saw it, I started watching around 9:30, so by 11:00 when it was over I was a LITTLE tired of it, and would have rated it at roughly 1 star. It deserves a higher rating than that. The F13 sequels always have a little something extra in them that most horror sequels lack. I think it's called creativity. Yes this is a creative sequel. I am a rather jaded critic, and under a critical eye,this movie is not that great.But then again it was not made for a critical eye. It is a terrific summer flick for a rainy night."
2,2 star movie!,Like the rest of the series this movie could of been so much better than it actually was. The storyline is a good one however. But everything else seems to fall far short including the directing.
2,Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood,"Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood~ Terry Kiser is a terrible sequel in the seemingly endless Friday the 13th franchise. The script is terrible and wastes the psychic spin completely. The spin with the psychic girl could have been done well but it is so poorly executed that one wonders if this movie was done as a high-school project. The acting is downright awful and the actors sound like they had like been to Hollywood upstairs acting school. The music though is the worst schlock I have heard in a long time and is absolutely atrocious. I love the tacky and cheap looking 80's clothes, the even worst hair does and the cheap special effects that even looked cheap back when this movie was done. Then again this is the seventh movie in a series and to think that it would have a huge budget is delusional. Still it gets like 2 out of 5 stars. Recommended only for die hard Friday the 13th fans otherwise avoid this less then stellar movie."
1,"Cut or uncut, this is a BAD movie","It all boils down to Jason vs. Carrie. Puh-leeze. The ""Friday"" films were never known for their originality or great scripts, but this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. John Carl Buechler is even worse at directing than he is at creating make-up effects. And that, my friends, is saying something!The series ended with ""Jason Lives"", as far as I'm concerned."
4,Hammerfall Rocks,"Well to be quite honest, I have seen higher quality Concert/Documentary DVDs then this one, but Hammerfall still takes home Four stars from me. Personally I found the DVDs set list to be quite well rounded (songs from 'Glory to the Brave' to 'Renegade' are played) and even the Hammerfall versions of 'I Want out' (sung with Kai Hansen) and 'Breaking the Law' (with a special line up) make an appearance on the DVD. Whats more 'Heeding the Call' has been redone in an acoustic format (which sounds pretty cool i think)I must say that the guys at Hammerfall are not only great musicians, but are quite funny too (demonstrated by their antics and even more so in the outtakes). The DVD has something for everyone and will certainly at some points make you laugh."
3,Lack of dvd technical expertise;,"The dvd has a good material, but it seems hammerfall and producers didn't wanted to keep the METAL in a good shape, but to express it through a low fidelity dvd. The dvd doesn't even have a Stereo Dolby sorround but a poor LCM Stereo, and a excesively beginer video style, with a sony handycam cuality, and a single camera shooting the set.Its fun to see them play and the concerts and the shows they manage to set. great material but a clear bad organization, and budget."
3,Enough Fluff,"This article, though pretty well written, was not a hard hitting or deeply informative piece. I was dissapointed overall, but I did manage to pull a couple of valuable pieces of information out of the article. If you're in the industry, then don't waste your time, but a layman, or a first timer might find this article interesting as foundation work."
2,Never Could Believe the Story,"Denzel was very good and the state of health care in the U.S. is atrocious as is the red tape and costs but, ignorance of the law or laws intitles you to nothing! If everyone who needed emergency surgery started taking hostages, hospitals would be guarded like Fort Knox. Then stick in Anne Heche as a totally unbelievable, ""underdressed"", hospital administrater, Duval and Liotta as two guys they grabbed at the water cooler and said get in the movie and play cops and a gaggle of Chicago cops all pointing their loaded guns at an emergency room full of sick, innocent people, not to leave out the ""heart transplant"" surgery that has to be done by a team of several physicians and technicians. You'll like how they toss the heart right in the hole, slam dunk. Then after all this Denzel is given a trial scripted by Frank Capra. The car crash scene was really cool. Well meaning movie, terrible waste of talent."
4,A Father's Love,"John Q starring Denzel Washington is a very touching story about a man who would sacrifice his own life to save the life of his son. His young boy has a heart that is about to explode and he is in severe need of a transplant. After getting the run around due to a lack of adequate healthcare, he does what any normal and loving parent would do. Denzel's character goes to the extreme in his attempt to save his little boy's life. It is a riveting story about a man who risks everything to challenge the healthcare system that aimed to push him aside. The movie touches on the growing problem that our country is facing in regards to proper healthcare. I was personally moved, however, by the ""spiritual"" typology displayed through Denzel's character. John Q was prepared to die so that his son could live... It only shows the deep love that a parent has for a child who is facing certain death. John Q was a terrific film and I recommend that everyone view this piece. Kudos!"
4,Tragedy of being poor...,"John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a factory worker who is struggling financially due to low demand of work force at his work and his has lost his wife's car to the bank. However, like all other families they try to get by and enjoy life whenever possible such as going to see their son play baseball. This time it is not pleasurable, because their son passes out and later at the hospital they find out that he has a heart condition, which requires a heart transplant. Their insurance will not cover the transplant, and there is not much time left for their son in this world if he does not get the heart transplant. The viewers will experience a tragic story in this film by feeling and viewing the desperate measures of John Q."
1,How to make an advertisment look like a movie,This is a ridiculous movie length advertisment for national health care disguised as a movie. Stick a good actor in it and it looks even more like a move. Steal a plot from another movie (i.e. Dog Day Afternoon) and it gets even closer to looking like a movie.But the smart ones know better.
1,A shameless commercial for HillaryCare,"I can only say that the first thirty minutes of this movie blows...that's when we turned it off. An impossibly contrived nice, good looking black family; thrown into an impossibly contrived tragic circumstance, confronted by impossibly contrived evil, uncaring healthcare bean-counters who are all conspicuously Caucasian. I'm sure in the following ninety minutes our hero would single handedly reform the US healthcare system into an impossibly contrived, well-oiled machine where nobody dies and everything is ""free"" down to the last cough-drop."
1,"The DNC wrote the plot, Good Fiction!","This piece must be up for a award from the DNC. This movie has it all, Gun owner Hate, Rich people Bashing, Corporate America Hate, HMO Hate, Trust the Government to take care of you, and of course the Police are bad rant. This movie was a masterpiece the Third Reich would have been proud of. The quality acting of Denzel Washington and Robert Duvall could not save this movie. The final insult to Injury was the ... news clips of the Socialist Bill Maher, Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton Spewing the Party line Health care Drivel. I give this movie a P.U. Propaganda Unentertaining!"
1,Holly wood liberal propaganda,This is not a movie; this is liberal propaganda for socialized medicine. The little boy gets a heart and his Daddy goes to jail for forcing the system to give him one. In Canada or England the little boy just dies.
2,It is what it is. Unrealistic and a tearjerker,"It is offensive that Hollywood would make this movie and not donate the profits to people like John Q. Imagine the medical care Denzel Washington's salary alone would pay for? Probably at least one kidney transplant.There should be a purpose to a movie like John Q., and there just wasn't one in this film. The plot was very unrealistic with the free care, welfare, and other hospital-assisted funding programs out there. We should thank heaven above we are living in the United States of America where we still have some of the very best healthcare services available to everyone.I thought this movie made hospitals the bad guy just to make John Q. more sympathetic. I gave the movie two stars vs. one star because of Denzel's performance."
1,Awful,"Hollywood junk. Maybe there could have been a decent movie in there somewhere, but we'll never know. Cardboard characters, linear predictable plotting, sophomoric dialogue, and a 30-year old vixen playing the oh-so-evil hospital director make this the must-miss movie of the decade."
1,Roll the ugliness.,"Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. This is a blatant propaganda film about the poor health care system in this country. I know the system is bad, but do I need a movie with horrible dialogue and stereotyped characters to tell me this? The writing for this film is so unoriginal and uninspired. It sounds as though the writer of the screenplay was working under serious time constraints. Denzel's repeated cries of ""Sick/Help! Sick/Help!"" is just one example. I almost puked at the end when Denzel's little boy repeats one of Denzel's lines from earlier in the film: ""don't say goodbye, say see you later,"" or something like that. Holy smokes! Now that's original writing! I could go on and on. Please don't waste your time or money."
4,VERY DRAMATIC!,"Denzel diserved another oscar for this performance! This movieshows you how much insurance companys really suck, and how moneyis more important than a human life! If this movie doesn't puttears in your eyes, you're not human! I won't write a book fora review like some people. I'll just say, this is a great movie,that everyone should see."
5,Awesome movie,The first time I was this movie was in my health class. It is such a good movie. The story that is told in the movie is realistic and the actors played well. I even cried a couple of times during the movie. It's very touching.
2,It's just so improbable !,I was expected a good movie and i found this movie just not good enough ! Too many coincidences make this movie not realistic at all ! The character's dialogues are just stupid and it's also full of cliches.A great deception ! A movie for Grand Daddy and Mummy for sure.
5,John Q. (Infinifilm Edition),"John Quincy Archibald's son Michael collapses while playing baseball as a result of heart failure. John rushes Michael to a hospital emergency room where he is informed that Michael's only hope is a transplant. Unfortunately, John's insurance won't cover his son's transplant. Out of options, John Q. takes the emergency room staff and patients hostage until hospital doctors agree to do the transplant. ""John Q"" is a thought-provoking movie that will cause you to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. A very human and affecting drama."
2,must have been a Contract film for Denzel,this the kind of film that must have been a Contract Obligation for Denzel Washington because this Film is So Cliched&a One trick pony of the first order in every which a way.Denzel does a Good Acting as Usual but this Film overall is very Predictable&just there.the Kind of Film you watch&you are done with it.
5,Excellent Movie,"Denzel has done it again. He is truly an amazing actor and no one can touch him. This is the movie he should get an Oscar for. This movie truly showcases his talent. I hate that people here basically told the whole story. DON'T DO THAT! You all are just ruining it for people. Anyway, this is a real tearjerker. When you purchase this movie, you will NOT regret it. I promise you that."
2,This should have been a great movie,"This should have been a great movie, but at best it a B movie.The portrayals of the Archibald family by Denzel Washington, Kinberly Elise and Daniel E. Smith are ok, but then as the movie progresses the support cast is simply awful. How can the likes of Anne Heche, James Woods, and Robert Duvall ruin a movie with bad acting? I don't know but it happened here. With a cast like this this film could have been gold, with a subject like this this movie could have had a social impact. But it's trash.This is probably the first movie I have seen Denzel in that was this bad. He does his best to save the film but the rest of the acting, editing, and directing is so bad, even a star like Denzel can't help what could have a been brilliant film and social statement."
1,John Q (DVD),"I would rate this NO STAR if I could. I was very disappointed with this purchase. My boyfriend really wanted to see this movie so I searched carefully to make sure that the DVD would work in our region. We finally sat down to watch John Q and the TV displayed ""REGION ERROR"". I am positive that when I placed the order that it was the correct region but obviously the DVD itself was not. This is the last time I will purchase DVD from Amazon."
4,Fast and Secure Shippping!,"I'm always skeptical when buying anything used, but I checked their reviews and was conceived to buy from them. I usually receive my movies shortly after putting in my order, but this movie took longer. No biggie I ordered it on a sunday. Once my movie arrived we popped it in and started watching. The movie was clean, no scratches and the case was fairly new just like they had said. Overall, I will be making more purchases from them."
4,Denzel Washinton = A++,"John Q. Is an awesome movie, Denzel Washington does a great job as John Q. and the movie shows the reality of health care."
2,Bad Movie with a Decent Message,"John Q is very predictable and unrealistic. It has its moments, but you can pretty much figure out most of the movie about a quarter of the way through it. The biggest problem is the way people react to different situations throughout the film. This makes it very unbelievable and almost laughable. The overall message of the film about our healthcare system is alright, but it's something I think most people are aware of. The only thing good about this movie is Denzel Washington. As always, he does an excellent job with his character. Not worth buying or even watching unless you are a huge Denzel fan."
3,sizzle but no steak,"I watched the movie because of Denzel Washington and the long list of A-list actors and actresses. Denzel was simply brilliant as John Q and his portrayal was never in doubt but what dragged the movie down was its cliches right from the beginning to the very end. The ending was a huge disappointment. I guess that the ending was executed that way by gauging the reaction from the audience survey, and perhaps, there would be an alternative ending in the DVD version later. Other than Denzel, the rest of the crew was left with hardly any scrapes to develop their characters further. You can say that they came out to be two-dimensional when they have the capacity to achieve more. Worth watching but then again, you could watch ER instead. Trust me, you haven't missed much!"
5,Love Everything,"I love everything, especially my Girlfriend DVD's. Hours of non stop laughter.I especially love the FDS, because you can't find the white blossom anymore, anywhere but online with Amoazon.com."
1,Nice Try; No Cigar,"The quick shot of the lamentable Hilary Clinton at the end of this epic gave the whole thing away--A Libber hatchet job on the American health care system.When appealing to the lowest common denominator intellect--Democrat voters--all it takes are easy targets and some hearts and flowers, all of which are in ample abundance in this movie.Knuckledomes and Kerry devotees will eat it up.All others, stay away."
3,Horrible,"I was utterly surprised at the reactions of the audience when I went to see this in the theater. I could not believe that I appeared to be the only person who was totally apalled to the plot of this story.Denzel...always great. With the exception of Training Day. But the plot and premise of this movie is not plausible at all. I understand that one would do anything for their child ( I probably would to), but there is no way I am condoning the taking hostage of a group of individuals. Totally ridiculous.This movie, itself, had good acting. But that's about it. The storyline was too ridiculous."
1,Big-time misfire,"The dialogue is riddled with cliches, the humor is unfunny, the supporting characters are caricatures, the suspense is tepid, some of the heart-tug scenes made me want to run screaming from the room. The first hour seemed like two. We don't learn the significance of the opening scene until much later, and when we do there's no payoff, no ""aha."" We are forced to wade through a ton of emotional muck to arrive at a totally predictable ending. Other than that, not a bad flick!"
1,Denzel's Worst Movie,"Hokie movie. Unrealistic, boring, predictable, over dramatized, and dumb. Don't even waste your money renting this video. Denzel should be ashamed for making this movie. Anyone who rates this above 1 star has issues."
5,POWERFUL AND INTENSE,"I Was about to watch this movie and i thought it would be a very slow sad movie. But when the movie got going I realized that it's extremely intense thriller.Now it still had its drama to it (don't get me wrong). The movie kaept you guessing until the end, And when it was over you felt so moved touched by the real drama in the movie. If you rent or buy any movie this year make it this one"
5,Great Movie!,"This is the saddest movie I've ever seen, but it was great. I must have cried like, every 15 minutes, but I still think that the movie was worth it. Denzel Washington is wonderful as the father of a little boy with a heart that is three times the normal size. I think that Mr. Washington should have got a nomintaion for this instead of Training Day, which I'm not allowed to see."
4,Pushes All the buttons,"If you watch John Q, be prepared to have all your buttons pushed. This is easily one of the most manipulative movies I've seen in a long time. Bam! HMO's are bad. BAM! Doctors are only out for money! BAM! Hospitals are cruel, uncaring places. Bam! Insurance companies are scum! Bam! Police Chiefs are idiots!Despite that, however, this is a good film to watch. Yes, you will be cheering for John Q and will be outraged at the way he and his family are treated by a callous system that allows the family to fall through the cracks in the medical care system.Denzel Washington is, as always, terrific to watch as the poor schmuck who just never quite manages to make it, although he means well. I have to admit, I found the kid VERY annoying-- much too cute and perfect, but fortunately he wasn't on screen that much. The important thing is the message of the film-- it is a crime that in the richest country on earth there are people who cannot afford medical care."
4,"Great Actors, Average Plot","Firstly, the plot is weak in places. It is predictable, it is clished, it is a Hollywood blockbuster. Without the cast it would be 3 stars, or less.But, with the acting ability of the whole cast, the film is saved. Denzel Washington plays John Q. Archibald, who's son needs a heart transplant, but of course, its gonna cost ya. James Woods plays the evil dude once again, and tells John he needs to pay 250k, but unfortunately John is not insured and cannot pay it, and his son will die. So, the rational explanation is obviously to hijack the ER and hold everyone hostage until they put his son on the transplant list. Robert Duvall plays the police negotiator, who you snense feels almost sorry for John, but Ray Liotta comes in and plays mr. steelballs ordering someone to snipe John. The plot unravels (predictably) but ends well, leaving you feeling all nice and warm inside.Very good cast, acting, ok plot, 4 stars."
4,John Q,"I really enjoyed the movie but I feel the medical scenes should have been made to be more realistic. But the spurts of comedy were good. It all flowed together well in the manner in which it was presented. Here you have a guy down on his luck just wanting his child to survive so he takes an emergency room as hostage and threatens to kill everyone in the room, but he has only one bullet, and it is not even in the gun. Most of the people in the emergency room once they understood John Q (Denzel Washington) began to like him. They found him to be a good, caring, hard working guy who was cornered by circumstances beyond his control. All John Q wanted was to save his son by getting him a heart. Denzel Washington did an excellent job of making everyone feel his pain in the show as well as in the audience. I'm not sure if it was really meant to show the medical care problems in the United States but it does. Which is a good thing."
5,Great movie!,"I use this movie in a health care class and it is great for discussing multiple issues in health care. Even though it is not a most recent video, it is still timely as we still struggle with managing health care costs and deciding how expensive procedures and treatments will be covered - especially once the government takes over costs! I suspect that there would still be no money for his son to have heart surgery - and perhaps not even the treatment he did receive!"
4,Geography with a Purpose,"The most fascinating aspect of reading The Edges of the Earth in Ancient Thought by James S. Romm is to learn that for the ancients, geography was more of a literary device than a budding science. In a way, it was more complex than that as the lines between literature and science were often blurred. It is interesting to note that the idea of the edge of the earth was most often used to create a moral lesson and what a better well to draw a taste of moral water from than the area where the least information is available. It was a blank slate of sorts for the ancient historians, geographers, philosophers and various other writers to create their own messages for their own purposes. And in that the variety lies the pleasure in this short, readable look at the times of ancient Rome and Greece."
4,"The ""INCOMPLETE"" horse riding manual","This book would have gotten 5 stars if it were actually the ""complete"" riding manual. It covered no western events! I love riding english but i want to know more about the western events too. Anyway, this book covers almost everything you need to know about riding in general to riding in advanced shows. It seemed to me that the beginning of the book didnt really go into detail, it just sort of told the basics but didnt say why. Im going to re-read the whole thing again. The book itself was AMAZING and i reccomend it to EVERYONE!!! (but maybe, just maybe, they will change the title, PLEASE). go buy this book!"
1,Hire a plumber,"So what they don't tell you is that you have to hire a plumber to install this kit (unless you REALLY know what you're doing.) I still have it, in a drawer, because I'm sure I'll need it one day. But not anytime soon. It's much, MUCH easier to keep this thing on the counter if it won't offend your delicate decorating sensibilities."
4,Eventually a good product,"I love my filtration system from New Wave and wanted to keep it. So we ordered the conversion kit when we were ready to install it under the sink. The first problem was that only half the shipment came. There was no faucet as pictured in the description, and no indication that there was another shipment needed to complete the order. I talked to Amazon and they eventually sent the faucet. We did have to purchase about $40 worth of additional parts to make it work and then it barely flowed when it was installed. We found that the flexible tubing under the sink was crimped. In fact it was pretty hard to correct that, as the tubing folds over itself fairly easily. Eventually, it worked very well and I am now very happy with the end result."
3,almost perfect,"i like this product and ordered one after checking out my friend's setup. my filter was previously sitting on the counter with faucet attachment. the problem with the conversion kit i got is that the ""L"" shaped mounting bracket in no way at all fits to the filter housing. so basically i cannot mount it under the sink. it also does not look like the bracket that is pictured in the instructions. so ?"
3,New Wave Enviro Kit Leaks and hard to install,"The water quality is good, but it was very difficult for a professional plumber to install. There is still a leak inside the mechanism that runs down the hose under the sink. If we hadn't noticed it would have flooded the house. They are replacing the mechanism, so hopefully this will help. Paying a plumber to come out twice is not worth it."
2,Small is too small,"The product was too small. Fits the size of a small child, gave them away to someone in need to avoid shipping them back..."
4,Good for the price,This product was bought in mine for using as a light for when I escort fallen troops or welcoming home troops as a patriot guard rider. Its works great I just had to glue a piece on that enables the light to turn. A quick fix for something minor. Since then it works just fine.
1,bright,"The light is very bright, how ever it does not turn. So far I have returned two of them. I hope the third one works."
3,Cord is too short,"The light is good, the magnet is strong, but who designed the cord? My truck, like most vehicles, has a power outlet in the middle of the dashboard, below the radio. To actually plug this in and attach it to the top of the truck, you have to stretch it to its full length, straight across the steering wheel and stick it at the connection of the door and the roof. It would be dangerous and near impossible to actually drive your vehicle with this light on. Don't think you'll be like Starsky and Hutch and be able to just swing this baby up and slap it on the roof and go. And, there is no on-off switch. If its plugged in, it flashes. If the manufacturer had given you about three more feet of cord, this would be a terrific item for your car. As it is, it's moderately useful. At $20 its still a ""buy"" for me, but if you can find a similar product with a longer cord, go for it."
5,Very Good,I Need a green one just like this if yall have it or can get it E-mail me This one is great and I use it A lot
3,Ok but cord is a little short,Would be good if the cord was a little longer. You really need an extension cable to be able to put it on the roof of your car.
3,not totaly satisfied,"I bought this light six months ago. I like the light, its magnet is good. But the plugin is horrible. When I got this light I pluged it in and it would not rotate. I tapped on the lense and it started to rotate it rotated for about five seconds before it broke. I took the plug appart and the solder job was terrible. Resoldered the wires worked fine. Plug broke again resoldered five more times since then. Finally replaced plug, works just fine now."
3,Wolo Model 3200-A Emergency 1 Magnetic Mount Teardrop Style Rotating Warning Light - Amber,"Better then I thought.. The light works well, and I never had an issue with mounting it stays in place. The only issue is the cord could be longer it's nowhere long enough to be mounted on a extended cab so I made my own wiring."
3,This light Needs a longer cord.,"This light worked fairly well after I finally got it to rotate. I had to remove the lens, and hand start the motor the first time. Afterward, it worked for its intended purpose, on an escort vehicle. However, though the magnetic base held fast, the coiled cord is too short to reach the lighter socket in my Saturn, and I had to purchase an ""extension"" plug to reach. Even that was not quite long enough, as the light cords were stretched out. This caused the plug wiring to become loose, and now the light won't function without repairing the plugs. To rectify this condition, I will have to add wire to the 4-socket plug, and HARD-WIRE the lights to it. A lot of work that I should not need to do! I guess you get what you pay for. Save yourself the trouble, and spend a little more on a better light."
3,Good for once in awhile use.,"Works well and holds fine. My only issue was the cable is a bit short for use in my full size work van. On a car it would be okay, but I can put up with it given the price."
1,Wouldn't buy this item,"I bought this dock for my female red-eared slider. I would not recommend it at all unless you have a very small or young turtle. The dock is too light, so when the turtle gets on it, it tilts to one side so the turtle is still fully submersed in water. It's also very difficult for the turtle to get on the dock because it is just too light and flimsy. Need something more sturdy!I'm returning this item!"
2,not as helpful,"It doesn't include all of the homeworks. and only has some of them. It's some what helpful but it's not complete. but for only $4, it is not bad."
3,"good, but not complete",These answers are great to use while self teaching yourself the material from al-kitaab. The only problem is that not all of the problem sets are answered.
3,Not a Complete Answer Book,"The book was definitely useful for my class, but it does not have ALL the answers, just some for each chapter. However, it was good enough for me."
2,"The ""improved"" design is a step back","I've always preferred Tampax because they're just plain tampons with no skirts and they don't expand and they're not scented and the cardboard applicator is simple and flushable, but the redesigned ones are everything I don't want. They're also smaller but cost the same. This is the kick in the pants I needed to switch to the Diva Cup."
1,The marketing guy must have suggested these changes.,The only thing positive to say about the new style of Tampax is that there are other brands that are less expensive that are almost as good as the original Tampax tampons. The new ones must have been revamped by their fresh out of college marketing guy. They are unacceptable. Uncomfortable. Unaffective.
2,no thanks!,"This stuff is mid to late season, best used for cooking. Far too dark and molasses like for pancakes or waffle use."
3,Grade B,"I thought it was less expensive because I was buying in bulk. I didn't notice that it was Grade B. I wish I had. It was still pretty good, but I wasn't getting the bargain that I thought I was.It does seem to be thoroughly gluten free though as I didn't react to it and I am very sensitive to low levels of gluten."
5,Solid gold 70's disco funk.,"Rain Shine, Don't Mind. Got to keep on dancin', keep on dancin'. This is the music that made the 70's worth listening too. The 1978 remix of Grooveline is fantastic and easily downloadable FYI. It's a fresh breath of funk for all the kids to get down to, even if they are your parents. So party like it's 1979 all over again. Just don't forget you still have to work the next day."
5,"Incisive, poetic, powerful","I nodded in agreement at virtually every page. I put the book down frequently to absorb the shock of reading my own experiences, captured in a few incisive master strokes. ""Silence is in the eyes of the white girl with long blonde hair searching mine for love."" I laughed out loud at the skewering of entitled ignorance: ""Did he buy you from a catalog? How come you know all our songs?"" (Questions I've Been Asked Ever Since I Arrived in the US in 1983). I breathed deep in appreciation for the painful truths on the 100 years of US colonial history in the Philippines. I gulped ""A Book Of Her Own"" down in a single day, dancing from poetry to autobiography to mythology to critical essays to history to ritual. This is a book that sings, weeps, re-knits what has been torn, reclaims what has been stolen, avenges what has been violated. Above all, it breaks the toxic silence of colonization, to heal and illuminate."
1,"I give this a ZERO, but that's not an option.","It is total crap, has NOTHING in relation to the original for the most part. Nothing creepy, no social commentary, no decent effects NOTHING! It is just trying to cash in on the C.H.U.D. name. Leave it be!"
1,hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,"with a title name like CHUD2: BUD THE CHUD, this is a classic, horrible sequel that makes the first one seem like a classic horrible orignal. for fans who think both of the movies are super and cool. why would anyone think that anyway and I agree with Leonard Maltin"
2,Cheap plastic,More bad than good for the Denon's for me. I used them probably for 2-3 hours a week at most and never misused them. For the 1.5 years that I had them they broke twice on the plastic piece that allows you to adjust the size. Pretty upsetting for someone who doesn't DJ all that much and has to go out and spend $130 for a set of new headphones.The only upside was they had real good sound quality.
1,"Great sound, but BREAK to easily!!!","I have used these headphones only for djin which has been 6 times since i bought these headphones. They have awesome sound, but already the left had side phone has broken off!! Not happy... Dont waste your money unless you like going through headphones once a month, i definitly would not buy these headphones again."
2,great performances spoiled?,"Great performances spoiled? Well, we'll never know, because the sound quality is so poor (it's marginally better in some sonatas than in others). Grumiaux and Haskil are such superb and musicianly players that one has to give them the benefit of the doubt -- and we know of their quality from other recordings: Haskil's Mozart, Grumiax's Beethoven Concerto recordings. But in the Kreutzer, for example, you just can't hear the clear articulation of the piano's notes. The violin sound is a bit more to the fore, but it too seems ""spread,"" so there is clearly a problem in the engineering somewhere. Put on Argerich and Kremer's Kreutzer, and you're hearing stuff you didn't know was there in the Grumiaux/Haskil recording. So I'm with Julian Cardona on this one -- and I'm not an audiophile either."
5,Great resource!,This book offers an excellent overview of back pain and its underlying causes and treatments. The diagrams are very insightful and easy to understand yet they convey a great deal of information to the reader. Worth every penny!
5,Chocolate Fountain,"I purchased this product for my daughtgers birthday party, it was just perfect,it works right away,its the right size. and its very easy to clean,I had no problems with it. Id Fully recomend this product to everyone else."
5,Great Fun,"This was a real Christmas hit with the kids we had chocolate everything, include the kids hair! I was impressed with the quality of the stainless steel.It can be a mess to clean up and kind of wasteful, but guess you need to expect that."
5,E.C. Tubb and Dumarest,"E.C. Tubb was a wonderful writer who created the Earl Dumarest series of books that follow the exploits of a man who wants to find his planet of birth - earth! Earth had become a mythical place and book after book in the Dumarest saga offers tantalizing clues to further Earl's quest. Armed with little more than a nine inch sword he keeps ready in his boot - and incredibly fast reflexes and finely honed wits and instinct, Dumarest overcomes a variety of people, places and things - and usually wins the hearts - or at least the bodies - of many gorgeous women who either need or want his help - or want him to settle down and forget his search for earth. Undaunted, Dumarest is haunted by both his past and intended future."
1,You have to be kidding!,"... Everybody involved in this film should either be punished or have their SAG memberships revoked! Where to start - the writers of the screenplay obviously only read the book jacket. The story is so [messed] up and ruined that it is unbelievable. Casting: WOW - makes some of the bad choices in INTERVIEW look inspired. Townsend tries about 5 different accents - all of them bad. Aailyah (sp?) would have died from embarrassment if the plane hadn't taken her. We could go on down the line, beacuse everyone is either horribly miscast or a horrible actor. The sets are cheap and cheesey - some look like painted cardboard. Lighting and design - well, at one point Aailyah came out and I thought it was a Janet Jackson video from the 80's. Run - FAST - from this one!"
3,Better than Tom Cruise...,"Well, this movie has its flaws. It compresses two books into one ninety-minute tailspin and has the film equivalent of ADD- too much in too little time. As a serious movie, it's... well, not to be taken seriously.HOWEVER. Stuart Townsend is absolutely edible, and his makeup and lynxlike inscrutability save the more languid moments of the film. Aaliyah is believable if a bit wooden, but she's pure eye candy. And as my friend... agrees, this movie is loads better than Tom Cruise pretending to be Lestat. It's beautifully shot, with a great soundtrack, and better than the first attempt. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I would put on a pair of comfy sweats and eat a bunch of ice cream while watching it. It's the film version of comfort food.Enjoy!"
1,Poor interpretation of the book.,I fell asleep 3 times while trying to watch it. This movie is not scary at all. It doesn't even come close to the book. I suppose that every body has their own way of interpreting a story and they come up with the films. But in this case the film production differed from the original theme of the story. I stay with the book.
1,Why is Aaliyah on the cover?,"I did not like the movie at all, it was really boring. I honestly went to see Aaliyah because she was on the cover of the poster as well as in the movie's title, but she was only in it for about 10 minutes which was divided toward the end of the film."
1,AT LAST ! A FILM TO PROMOTE ILLITERACY !,"If you'd like to insult the injured Anne Rice any further,then watch this 105-minute MTV escapee."
2,Aaliyah & the soundtrack,"Well Aaliyah actually turned out to be Akasha. At first I was very sceptical, but I saw her as Akasha when I watched the movie, so that worked (plus she was a beatiful girl:(. Well the actor that plays Lestat, (sorry I didn't care enough to remember his name) tries real hard, but he is no Tom Cruise lol. The story line was horrible, sure interview with the vampire wasnt as acurate as the book, but it worked. I was looking forward so much to see the movie after I read the book, but this was a horrible plot and poor acting.So One star is for Aaliyahand the other star is for the music because soundtrack was excellentSo 2 stars since everything else sucked"
4,"Worst as an adaptation, best as an original.","I watched Interview With the Vampire and hated it! A movie MADE out of BOOK is really not a movie anymore. Sure it needs to follow the story line but EXACTLY as the book. hm... I think Stuart makes a way better Lestat than Tom. Tom's performance is rough. Even though he does look French but show nothing of the ""seducer Lestat"". The music of Queen of the Damned is amazing! Yeah, to classic or pop friends it might suck but to those listen to Rock. IT IS AMAZING! This movie added a beautiful gothic morden touch to vampire tales. I wish they could have included the deleted scenes"
4,Not too bad...,"Vampires have always been interesting to me, but I had never really been interested in watching this movie. I however, broke down and watched it. And I actually rank it high up there with Underworld which is my favorite vampire movie. I loved how the music flowed with the scenes a highly important aspect if you are going to involve music. I also liked how the movie flowed. The movie was not boring and never dragged along. I felt it was a good movie.**Yet in saying I like the movie...I have never read the book and I had no prior knowledge of the book when watching it. I just watched it for the movie aspect; and liked it.**"
5,"""Blood, sex, and rock n' roll.""","Love the movie, love the music, love the price! If you love vampires and rock n' roll you will love this movie. The mother of all vampires is back and her lust for blood came with her."
3,Aaliyah,"I got this movie because i'm Aaliyah fan. Aaliyah and the other actors/actresses played their roles very well even though it wasn't a very good movie, but it's not their fault, it's the producers & writers. This movie was horrible written, confusing, & had an annoying setting. But as a said, Aaliyah and the other actresses/actors were great."
3,queeen of the damed,this wasnt in the best condition..i noticed alot of scrathes on the dvd..which is upsetting due to its a christmas present to my daughter...
1,Queen of the Duped,"What a disappointment. While Townsend made a better Lestat, and Aaliyah made a great Queen, the plot was too bad to be forgiven. The makers of this film need to apologize to Anne Rice."
3,Hmmm...,"Alright, I must admit. This movie wasn't the absolute best I've seen in awhile, but it also didn't deserve a lot of flak that people are giving it. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because Aaliyah was in it. Well, partially anyway. Hollywood could have kept that other... The movie really didn't follow the book, and I was extremely disappointed when Aaliyah was not featured more in the movie. It probably would have made more sense. Anyway, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. R.I.P. Aaliyah"
1,Sad,"This movie was sad sad sad..... If you like the anne rice books just keeep reading the books. This Movie was ""Based"" on two books 'vampire lestat' and 'queen of the dammed' only about 3 pages from both books went into the script.. if you just want to see the singer alia youll like it. ..."
3,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this movie. Interview With a Vamppire was fantastic... so when I saw Queen of the Damned I was more than disappointed at the poor interpretation. Please do not misunderstand me. I think the acting and casting were beautifully done. If you have read the book, and want to look for similarities, I dont suggest trying. However, as a movie ( looking at it without prior knowledge) I would say it was a bit slow moving at first and too fast at the end. Two sequences were not introduced properly and may cause confusion. Also, this is not a movie you would want to view on family night if you want to desensitize your children."
4,Didn't go for the plot,"I never read the book. I didn't going into it looking for a deep plot. I went expecting a two hour very sexy rock video. I got exactly what I wanted. If this movie did anything else, it proved that Tom Cruise was the WRONG choice for Lestat but Stuart Townsend was perfection."
1,Complete Butchery!!!,"If you are a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, DO NOT see this movie!!! I was disgusted by the ruin that was made of Anne Rice's works. I bought this film not having seen it before hand, and it was a total waste of my money. The story line vaguely resembles the actual story and yes, if you've never actually read Queen of the damned you might like it. However, true readers should stay away as it will leave you with extreme disappointment and a bad taste in your mouth. If i could give this film zero stars I would!!!!"
1,TERRIBLE,"I saw this the week it had opened and was disgusted by the lack of adaptation. It had no connection with the book except for stealing the names of characters. It was like some horrible MTV Original Movie.The acting was absolutely terrible. I don't want to be harsh, but Aaliyah's effort in the film was awful, the only others who probably think otherwise are those who are still mourning over her death. Stuart was just downright ridiculous.The directors ruined the book as a whole. I won't say anymore, since everyone's practically covered it all."
3,Pretty Good,"Even though I thought ""Queen of the Damned"" was a pretty good movie, I wasn't very impressed by it. I never read the book, so I can't compare the two. While I did enjoy the fact that Lestat was more up-to-date and modern, I thought that Aaliyah's role as the mother of all vampires, Akasha, would have had more screen time. I was a little disappointed that it took such a long time for her to be on screen, and then before you knew it, she was being killed. I would have loved to have learned more about Akasha, what she was about, how she came to be, etc.Overall, I would say that this is a pretty good movie, but, to me, it's one that I'll watch once and probably won't watch again."
2,a decent comedy,"I liked this movie better than ""Scary Movie 2"", but it wasn't quite as good as ""Scary Movie 1"". Don't get me wrong: it was funny -- but it just wasn't as funny as it could have been. Too much dancing, maybe. Anne Rice is a major comedic writer, though -- right up there with Adam Sandler -- and I hope that her next movie is funnier."
4,"Ahhhh, the flaws...","To start off with, it was an excellent movie. I'm not saying it wasn't. But, there are too many errors they have made, especially if they are going to continue making remaining Vampire Chronicle books into movies. That is the major error. They killed off a couple of the major characters, added plot twists that make no good sense, and fragged up the ending. grr.. sometimes I wonder. The music is one of the major surprises to come off the film, and I'm proud to have been a fan of most of the singers, and of Jonathan Davis before it came out.If they plan on making another movie, they have many knots to untangle before proceeding. I hope the next writers have a little more sense when it comes to allowing for sequels.Stuart Townsend is a great Lestat, very yummy and better than Tom Cruise any day. Alliyah was wonderful, and I wish they had the opportunity to expand on her roll. The movie came out as a generally funny and overall good film, with enough action to suit me."
2,Save your money!,"If you are an Anne Rice reader, and have read and memorized every detail of the Chronicles, I have this to say: Don't watch this movie. It will break your heart.The only thing this movie has in common with the books is the title and the names of the characters. They've changed everything that made the book exceptional! I kept waiting for the joke to end and the real story to begin - but it didn't happen. I am thankful I didn't spend the money to watch this in the theater, and that I rented it first - otherwise I would probably have burned the DVD on my grill.If you haven't read the books and you like vampire/goth stuff, then you'll probably think the movie is just great. But trust me, read the books. They're better. I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back on this movie.I gave it one star since that's the lowest of the low, and another star just for Stuart Townsend who made a credible Lestat. Everything else about this movie was terribly disappointing."
5,Loved it,My daughter is a symphony player and there is a violin piece that we wanted to have off this movie. Price was so good and delivery was fast. I would use this seller again. Thank you
1,This was not the book at all...!,"Most of the other reviewers were right: This movie sucked!It was bad!These are my reasons:In the book:1. Lestat was blonde, not a dark red head!2. Lestat and Jessie never got emotionally involved with one another!3. Stuart Townsend was a great vampire, but he was not Lestat!4. Lestat killed evil doers, not young women who liked rock stars!5. The story was supposed to be about Akasha, not Lastat... that is why the book is called 'QUEEN OF THE DAMNED'!6. Marias was not Lastat's maker!The other things wrong with this movie are:7. It did not follow the book at all!8. Most of the actors were stale.9. Lena Olin's character was the only one who matched her description in the book!10. There was no character development for any of the characters except Lastat!Overall; This movie was a major let down to both fans and movie-goers alike!Read the book and own (the awesome) soundtrack!My grade: F or no stars!"
4,OK entertainment,"It's a vampire movie, the kind where the writers create new parts of the myth (""never take the last drop"") then seem to break their own rules.That's not the point, though. The point is that it's good action, it has a good noir feel, and that Aaliyah was about the hottest thing that ever hit the screen. In fact, the clean lines of her feline, much-exposed self barely fit the jagged grunge of the rest of the movie. That's the movie's problem, not hers.Three stars for the movie as a whole, but one more for Aaliyah. She was sorely under-utilized in this film, and it's sad to know that we won't see more of her.//wiredweird"
2,what is up with that?!,"i usually don't read much books, but when my cousin introduced me to Queen of the Damned i was kind of skeptical about reading it, but once i opened the book and read it i was attached to it and couldn't put it down. From then on i thought Ann Rice is one of the most awsome writers i truly enjoyed the book all the way. When I was inform that it was going to be made into a movie i was soo excited, but my blissful moment was soon to be destroyed once the movie started, it did not follow the book one bit. What the ... is up with Hollywood and Love stories?!! yo that was weak that they totally twisted the movie and turned it into a love story and compared to the book to the movie, the movie starts in the middle of the book. The characters are all way off by personality and on looks and some important actors are cut from the movie. But i give props to the action scenes cuz without it i prolly fall right to sleep."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I am a huge anne rice fan and have read the entire chronical. The movie was ..ok. If you've read the books you will understand more but be dissappointed in the changes. I liked townsend as lestat but the movie portrayed him horribly in my eyes. Cruise had the part down to the ""T"". Lestat was very arrogant and liked to sluaghter murderers and the likes not helpless women. He likes the hunt and sport of it. Aaliyah was a good pick for the queen she did have a commanding presence for the part. I didn't like how they switched roles of characters. Once I saw that I was outraged. I can't say anymore because it could spoil the movie for some people who have not yet watched it. The soundtrack was totally awesome, the music seeping to your heart and ripped it out and sucked the blood from it. All-in-all the movie is a good movie but anyone who has read the books may be dissapointed."
4,One of My Favorites.,"This is one of my favorite movies. I really like the songs and I think the actors did a pretty good job. I love Aaliyah, God rest her soul and I think she did a pretty good job for an inexperienced actress. She could have gone far. I liked the way the story of Lestat went and how cocky he got. I would recommend this movie to vampire movie lovers."
3,Akasha saves it from being the worst vampire movie ever.,"This movie, when I rented it, I had high hopes. Sadly, the first part of it, and up until Queen Akasha showed up, was a complete letdown and absolutely horrendous. I thought this film would be whacked to the bottom, until Akasha showed up and went on her killing spree. Then there were some really cool fight scenes and a lot of combusting and blood spilling. To say not a word of Akasha's sexiness and lots of cool lines. The ending was pretty good, and most of the movie's songs were decent at the worst. So if you want something to do, get this DVD and skip to the part from Akasha's appearence on. The first half, though, try to forget it ever existed. This movie is OK, not a comment be said. 6 out of 10, 3 stars. Nuff said."
3,Sexy and cool but it could've been so much more,"This movie is sexy with a good soundtrack and Stuart Townsend makes a fair Lestat. Vincent Spano ""The Crow: City of the Angels"" is ok too as the Vampire that turned Lestat. Other than that it's a mess how it tries to be two books at once. It's about Lestat becoming a rockstar and slapping other vampires in the face basically by announcing the existence of vampires. So that pisses them off towards him. Then the 3rd book is thrown into the movie on top of The Vampire Lestat book and it doesn't work. This is very below Interview with the Vampire but for some reason I could never force myself not to like it when I know it's bad. Still it's sad that the films took this direction after how good Interview with the Vampire was."
2,"could be better, could be worse","If you haven't read Anne Rice's books, and you're looking for a reasonably entertaining vampire movie, then give this one a try. However, if you have read her books, you will probably do what I did. I spent the entire two hours analyzing the fairly frequent and fairly important details they got wrong. Or regretting the lack of character development. Or plot development. Most of what I enjoy about Anne Rice's books (and the movie Interview with the Vampire, as well) is the careful attention to detail in developing her characters and their environment.But I do have to give credit where it is due. It wasn't bad acting that brought this movie down, it was a bad script. It could have been so much better."
3,good movie,I must admit I was expecting this movie to be bad since I heard so many negative thing's about it but I decided to see it anyways since I like vampire movies and I was pleasently surprised by it.I liked it from the begining of the movie.I thought Stuart Townsed made a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise.Although it wasn't a great movie it was a good movie compared to the ... other vampire movies like Forsaken and Dracula 2000.If you wanna see a good vampire movie I recommend this one.
2,Anne Rice shouldn't watch it ...,"This is a really bad movie, and awful adaptation of the second best vampires book by Anne Rice. I just hope Ms. Rice didn't bless this adaptation. There is only a very loose connection to the book, and not a good one. The movie tells the story about the vampire Lestat. The book is about the awakening of the evil represented by Akasha, the mother of all vampires, and about the struggle of ""good"" ancient vampires, who don't want to see the end of the humanity. The movie completely ignored the best part of the book: the story of ancient siblings, and only showed Maharet, in a few meaningless sequences. I don't recommend buying DVD or VHS. Wait until it gets shown on broadcast TV. You will be bored anyway."
1,Skip It -- Read the Books Instead!,"The only reason this movie gets ONE star is because of the potential of Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah. If this movie had been done right; that is, as two movies -- the Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned -- then they would have been a hell of a lot better than this bastardized version of two great novels. The writers, producer and director have pulled a mish-mast of plots from both novels, changed complete story lines, and created a mess. Stuart Townsend,Aaliyha, and Marguerite Moreau were great choices for the characters of Lestat, Akasha, and Jesse, but the rest were pathetic. Vincent Perez was completely wrong as Marius, Lena Olin was over the top as Maharet -- and this time no twin sister, in addition the characters of Pandora, Armand, and Mael were completely underused and poorly acted. If you love the Vampire Chronicles, skip his movie and enjoy the books instead."
3,"Good, but not the real story.......","This movie is not bad...........as long as you don't compare it to the book. Watch this movie without thinking of the book(s) (the movie is actually a combination of The Tale of The Body Theif and Queen of the Damned). I did enjoy the movie, once I stopped trying to compare it to the book.......unfortunately, as the other comment said, you can't put that many years of details into an hour and a half movie......it just doesn't work. Watch this movie like you've never read the book and you will enjoy it, although, I do wish Alliyah had more screen time and they had told the real story of Akasha. Also, they need to go back to Tom Cruise for the roll of Lestat......he's much [better]!"
2,Do you like vampire movies?,"Here's the rub: If you like vampire movies, watch it. If you don't, don't watch it.I watched this movie, all the way through and was confused as heck as to what was going on! I then watched the deleted scenes on the DVD.The fools! They should have left the deleted scenes in! When ""The Ancients"" showed up I had no idea who they were.Here's the deal. The gentleman they had play Lestat was actually quite good. He is no Tom Hanks or a Tom Cruise for that matter, but he did a serviceable job. He was believable.The young deceased singer who played the queen of the damned did fairly well too...the problem? The plot stank!It was so cut up and incongruous that it was nearly impossible to follow! The problem was, they followed Anne Rice's book probably a little too close. If you want to know how one of her books reads, then by gum, watch this train wreck. Or you could watch a good vamp movie like Lost Boys, or heck even Blade!"
4,Akasha (Countess Dracula-Carmilla in one),"Anne Rice's talented story creates a definite ""Queen "" of all vampires in this tale that reunites all the notable characters from her wonderful Vampire Chronicles. I can think back to the old days with movie icons such as Ingrid Pitt(Carmilla) and Gloria Holden (Dracula's Daughter) portraying powerful vamps on screen. However, this film allows a new generation of fans to witness how down right controlling a female vampire can be and should be. Queen of the Damned is fun and original. This shall be a classic. I can only fathom what Anne Rice will allow to come to life next. Sandra"
2,Nothing Like the Book,"If you enjoyed Anne Rice's Books, and thought that you wanted to see the movie ""based"" on the book you will be very dissapointed. It was as if someone gave the writer a incomplete outline on what the book was like. No twins, no story on how the queen became damned, no historical story line what so ever, is just another vampire movie. It should be viewed in that light."
4,Underrated and overhated,"POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS BELOW!Now let me clarify this right off the bat: I'm a HUGE Anne Rice fan. The Vampire Chronicles are among my favorite books of all time. This film is neither a faithful adaptation of Queen of the Damned nor of The Vampire Lestat, which it also borrows from. Rather, it is a sort of ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the 2 novels, with several liberties taken, the most obvious being with how Lestat is ""born"" into the vampire world.Now, if you can simply accept those facts, and that this is intended to be a popcorn/fun little flick, you might actually enjoy it. The acting isn't half bad, and the cinematography and visual effects are a lot of fun. Plus it has a soundtrack that, if you like bands like Korn and Disturbed, you should really dig."
3,Hollywood left out a lot of characters and the book in general,I just finished reading all 3 books last month. My husband got the Queen of the Damned DVD for me. I do love the music and will probably get the cd...I think the books were so detailed there is probably no way for them to do an accurate portrayal. I think they tried to make it into a love story with Lestat and Jessie...where as in the book they met once at the concert and again near the end...no love story in the book. It is still good to see anyway but I recommend you rent it instead of buying it. Stuart T. did a great job as Lestat...much better than Tom Cruise in the Interview with a Vampire movie.
1,Only b/c you can't select 0 stars!,"This movie was pure hollywood. They took something great and made it shallow and flashy. No substance, no plot, nothing. I can't fault the actors for anything except accepting roles in this disaster. I can't help but wonder if the people in charge even read the whole book. Did an assistant highlight the ""important scenes"" for them? Truly an awful, awful movie."
2,This was kinda weak,"I say this with the utmost respect to Mrs. Rice, I love her books, adore them, even, and i loved the Interview movie. This movie was weak. It didn't have that absolute gorgeousness that is the bread and butter of all of her work. Her books are so beautiful that they make me wanna cry. This movie made me wanna cry for a wholly other reason. It was simply........awful. See, now i'm mad at the movie."
1,A BIG PIECE OF FILTH,"This has to be one of the worst adaptation of a book. The acting was good, that's the only good thing. Other than references to names, nothing else resemble the book. If a person never read the book, I don't see how anyone understand the plot. The book was complex and exciting. The movie is simple and explains nothing. Lestat is a vampire. He joins a band and market himself as a real vampire. Some girl from a British institute studies vampires. This girl read a book diary of Lestat was made. Akasha, the queen, wakes up. She kills other vampires and falls in love with Lestat. A bunch of other ancient vampires (very interesting and important to the plot in th book, but never named or explained in the movie) battles with her in the end for their survival. They won. Lestat makes the girl and vampire and everyone lives for a few more centuries. Watch it, if you have to, but don't buy it. It sucks and very disappointing."
3,How to start?,"I think I may be one of the dozen people who watched this movie more than once. And, I think, that was the key to liking it for what it was.No, it's definitely not the book, but those who walk into ANY movie adapted from a book is usually going to be sorely disappointed, especially a book as rich as this. Or should I say two books? Hm.But I'm willing to defend it. I agree it's not much; I found myself skipping the more painful scenes after the first view-through. But there's something charming about how Stuart Townsend played Lestat, something in the eyes (which, I agree should have had a different eyeshadow around them), especially when it's just him acting. Something caught me about the movie, about Lestat, though I know better. It was how he finally got to live with someone, no matter who Hollywood chose for his partner.So, give it a try. At the worst, you only lose a couple bucks."
1,How Come there is no zero star choice???,"I tried to watch this movie with an open mine. But after the first 10 minutes the only thing that came to mind was ""What the H@ll"". I am a mainstream teenage american for whom this ""film"", if i dare call it that, was made and i really didn't like it. The first thing you really notice is that the whole movie should have been on MTV.The movie didn't have a plot what so ever. They could have atleast made on up for gods sake. Why cut out character who were important to only have them in for one minute of the film???The casting was terrible. Over all it was just a bad movie. Don't waste you time unless you like to self inflict pain towards oneself."
5,movie critic,".....I was young when Interview with a Vampire came out, but about 3 years ago i bought it and thought it was better than the crap i was watching then, but when i learned they were going to do a sequel, i was anxious to see it.Then even more when Aaliyah was cast as the leading role.AT the time she was my favorite singer ,and still is Then tragedy stroke and she was killed.I was hit with great appall.She is and forever will be a great singer and a humble human being.Definetly this movie will rock.You gotta see the movie, if u dont u will be sorry.You missed out on a great film.Yah heard!"
1,Only one star because I can't rate it lower,"Avoid this movie at all costs. I could feel the intelligence rushing from my head as I watched it. It really doesn't get much worse than this. This movie has it all. The guy who does his own thing no matter what the consequences. It has Aaliyah with an inconsistant, dodgy accent, and a Ministry of Funny Walks worthy gait. A huge climactic battle with two friends turned enemies suddenly friends again kung-fu fighting side by side.I think if the stars of this movie were ugly, it would never have been released."
5,Stop your complaining,"I keep reading all these [negative] reviews of what was a very good movie.Of course it wasn't true to the book, what movie is?And for the record, Stuart Townsend is Irish, not Russian.Instead of complaining, maybe all these naysayers should try writing their own screenplays."
2,Greatest Movie of 2002,"This movie was so great, I have not read the books seen interview with the vampire nothing, before seeing this I'd never even heard of Anne Rice. The day after I saw this movie I ran and bought the books and the movie ""Interview with the Vampire"". This one tops that movie in so so many ways. Stuart Townsend is Lestat and he does it 100 times better that Tom Cruise, who was only cast for star power. The late Aaliyah captured her character Akasha brillantly and proved just how great of an actress she really was. I hated Akasha all because of her talent. The music was good I dont usually like that goth style music, but I did buy the soundtrack and it is very good. Bottom line even if you don't like vampires this is a great movie to see."
2,what a disapointment,"well firstly i should say that i waited for this film fo a very long time and when i finally saw it i was very disapointed.I would like to say that marius did not make lestat magnus did, i think i could of play lestat better then stuart townsand did and there was only 1 twin when there suspose to be 2 .I felt that they should of introduced the vampires at the end cause i did not know who they were andTo get this movie correct with all the storys in it the movie would have to go for atleast 6 or 7 hours well i an not going to see this movie again and tom cruise did lestat perfect in interview with the vampire and i suggest u read the first 4 book in the vampire chronicles before u see the movie."
3,Definatly not the book!,"This movie could have been alot better but the soundtrack is amazing. :P Stuart Townsend did make a better Lastat than Tom Cruise did. He just looked like a vampire should I guess. My only gripe is Aaliyah. I did NOT like her in the movie, what little she was in it that is. I dont know if it was just the way she talked or walked or what but she was just not a good actress to play this character. Over all, the movie went fast and was to the point which was a plus over Interview and some of the special effects were excellent. There isnt much else to say about this movie other than if you are a die hard Rice fan, you might be a little disappointed since the book and the movie are almost completely different. Rent it before you buy it though."
3,The Queen succeeds,"not bad of a vampire movie and its not worthy of passing up Interview With The Vampire. Townsend is the vampire Lestat and Aaliyah is The Queen Of The Damned Akasha. Basically, longtime ago, Townsend woke up Aaliyah and then she is back for him to be his wife. Good vampire effects and loud and heavy and fun rock music by static-x, orgy, chesterbennington and so on. You could rename it Vampire Goldmine(Velvet Goldmine spoof)"
1,"AWFUL, but almost amusing for its sheer perversity","As a reverant fan of Anne Rice's books, I vowed to stay far away from this film. One night I was bored, it was there, so I watched it.This film is so terrible that a serious review isn't worth the effort. What is worth commentary is that far from being offended at seeing such a ludicrous interpretation of a book I loved, I was nearly amused at the sheer virtuostic badness of the film.It has the pleasure one gets when reading a collection of absurd first lines of novels, written to be deliberately and outstandlingly bad.If you know how the story was meant to be, you might get a good laugh, or at least a contemptous snigger. If not, this film won't leave so much as a clue to what you're missing - though you will rather wish you'd missed IT."
3,Song,The movie is ok - not the best but certainly interesting and kind of fun to watch.I have a question; what is the song playing in the Admiral's Arms when Jesse goes for the first time? I cannot find it!Thanks!
2,A huge waste of time.,"""Queen of the Damned"" is one of the worst vampire movies i have had the misfortune of watching. I thought Dracula 2000 was bad until i saw this, this, whatever it is. Sharing only its title in common with the book, this movie has butchered Anne Rice's vision. The acting is not bad, but not great. The special effects are good and yes Aaliyah is beautiful. I highly recommend you think twice about purchasing this movie. Most of the people that gave this movie 3 or more stars did so because they are big Aaliyah fans. Some even went so far as to write a condescending, self-serving, 'shame on you for not giving this movie 5 stars because Aaliyah's in it for 15 min.' review. Not naming any names *cough* a dark colored liquid falling from the clouds *cough*. To this I say, even if you are an Aaliyah fan stay away from this movie, it's not worth your money."
1,"Pure Swill, Waste of Money, 0 stars","This movie is the poorest movie i've ever seen, besides anything ed wood directed. but anyways, this movie was horrible, the lip syncing was hilariously made, you could tell that he lip synced every single time he sang in the movie. in fact the only parts that are worth watching are when jonathan davis does a cameo, and pretty much any part that involves the music (besides the concerts, they ...). the soundtrack was awesome though, buy the soundtrack, forget the movie. i found the quality funnier than almost anything i've ever seen. it's terrible, don't buy it!"
4,"Great dvd, slooooowwww shipping","We enjoyed the dvd. We did not put a rush on the shipping, and even despite that the video took much longer to receive than even anticipated. It seems as though it got lost, even with a tracking number. That was a little frustrating, but not sure how much that has to do with the company."
1,Not worth your time!,"This movie is just plain horrible, they completely butchered the storyline (Which I expect when I see a movie made from a book I've read, but this was just ridiculous). There is no plot, at least I couldn't find one and then to top it off they made the same mistake alot of other film makers are making... they all seem to have this morbid idea that pop singers can act! Now I will admit Aliyah (how ever you spell her name) does make a cool LOOKING vampire they did do a good job with that, however it's ruined the minute she opens her mouth! Horrible acting! I think the only reason this movie made any money was from Aliyah's fans especially since she died."
1,really a negative 5 stars,If I were Anne Rice I would not be relating this movie to her book. The hollywoood people have yet again ruined a brilliant masterpiece by ignoring facts in both Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat. Nowhere is there a real resemblance at all. It is a real shame when the Hollywood guys get a hold of a good book and do a poor job adapting to the screen (which seems to be the norm). So do us all a favour in hollywood guys: start making real movies from books and stay true to the plot.
2,Ann Rice fans weep,"Ok, the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one, is becasue there ARE people who haven't read Rice (shame on you), and therefore can see this as just another vampire flick. In that case the movie isn't great, but there's worse out there. But for those who've read Rice and where hoping on a sequel to Interview with a Vampire (even though there wasn't a movie of the Vampire Lestat)this movie is a sad dissapointment, and not even worth one star. Aaliyah can't act, and moves as if trying to be shakira. The movie fails to stick to the story in the book on ALL critical points. Besides that, the fx are terrible, the acting is worse. Too bad, a good Queen of the Damned is what we were waiting for"
4,"Scary,Emotional Movie","This movie was great althought If Had seen this in theaters I probably wouldnt have bought it but Im happy with my choice. Aaliyah was scary looking and made me feel she really was Queen of all vampires Lestat and her had good chemistry The guy that said you couldnt play it on an x-box is wrong I watched this on my x-box. I would have love for this movie too have been a lil longer, They kind of cut and paste everything like they could have showed akasha killing all the people in the world and that girl that plays the human girl did a good job I dont scare easily and this had me Shaking a lil it was a great story told watch this at night and it'll feel even more scarier the reason it gets 4 stars is for not being longer. Great movie and put together decently."
2,A Departure,"I started reading the Vampire Chronicles after watching ""Interview With the Vampire"" when I was about 11. ""Queen of the Damned"" came out when I was in high school and, at the time, I was really into that type of music. I was disappointed that the movie was so different than the book, though I understand that the several different story lines in the book would be hard to translate to a movie, it would have been nice for some of the main plots to be seen. Stuart Townsend definately depicts the modern Lestat in the same way that Tom Cruise was able to embody the 18th-19th century Lestat. All in all, it's worth a watch once or twice, but it was a disappointment. Anne Rice should have been allowed to write the script for this installment as she did for ""Interview With the Vampire"" and I think we would have been more pleased."
4,A good vamp film,"This film was overall a good film, the music rocked in this film which I think helped it out alot which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. The acting in this film was really good but especially by Lestat and some of the older vampires. Alyiah was just ok but that was amainly because she hardly spoke and when she did it was unclear because of the fake accent and fangs. But the storyline was very good and is one of the better vamp movies i've seen, so i would recommend it to others."
4,Interesting and well done,This movie doesn't follow the book but should be viewed in its own right. As a stand alone with some Ann Rice tricks it is very well done.
1,Worst film adaptation yet.,"This movie is terrible. Even if I would of watched it on its own without ever reading the Anne Rice book it would of been a terrible cheesy vampire movie. I dont care how cute Stuart Townsend (Lestat) is. But being a big Anne Rice fan and Queen of the Damn being one of my favorite books made me hate this film even more. For anybody that hasnt seen it yet and is interested in watching it, I would strongly suggest reading the book first."
1,NOT WORTHY!,"First off I have to say that I bought this DVD, because I am a huge Anne Rice fan. Like many people, I read the book before seeing the movie, and was somewhat thrilled when I heard that Stuart Townsend was going to play Lestat-though many American's didn't know who he was at the time.However, this movie was not what I had expected. I believed that it would capture many aspects of Anne Rice's novel, like Interview With The Vampire did, but it's lacking. It would have been an enjoyable film for me, if I wouldn't have read the book, and found too many flaws within it. This movie was not worthy of being called QUEEN OF THE DAMNED-yes it has the characters that are so well known in The Vampire Chronicles, but this movie was lacking what it needed.If you haven't read the book, perhaps you'll enjoy the movie. On the otherhand, if you want the real story, don't waste your time-buy the book!"
1,A disappointment...,This movie is terrible. It doesn't do Anne Rice's novels justice. Go read Interview with a Vampire and The Vampire Lestat instead of seeing this awful adaptation.
4,"Movie Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend, thumbs up","Being a fan of Ann Rice's books I didn't think I would enjoy this movie very much only because a lot of movies slaughter the story that the book set. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this movie. They have great effects with fire in the bar scene which was very incredible looking. If you like movies about vampires or even hard rock music I suggest this movie."
1,A miserable attempt to give life to a great book,"It's always been my personal belief that if you aren't going to stay true to a novel, then you shouldn't make a movie about it. This movie was in no way, shape, or form either The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned. It was a pathetic attempt to gather some actors together, have them hiss and bare their fangs, and play music. The producers should never have tried to make this movie. They have no concept of being true to a novel, of characterization, or even of the concept of a plot."
1,Should have watched Peter Pan instead!,A ludicrous adaptation of a great novel. One star is too much credit. The bubblegum stuck to my shoes caught my attention better than the cheesy visuals and plot of this fetid [stuff]. Watcher beware: bring some duct tape to put over your mouth. It's the only way to stop your violent laughing from distrurbing the rest of the theater...
3,Not so bad,"I am not a big vampire movie fan so naturally I was expecting a horrible blood sucking movie. Granted, this movie is full of blood sucking and horrific blood scenes, but I think the awesome music kept me interested. I think the actors were great and Aaliyah was incredible, although she wasn't in the movie long enough. I only went to see this movie because of Aaliyah. Overall, I would pay to see it again and would definitely purchase the dvd."
1,Much anticipatied-but a true disapointment,I was very excited when I heard they were making a sequal to Interview and went to the theatre to see the movie.By the end of Queen of the Damned I was furious.The only way you should see this movie is if you have never read the book.The story of the Twins is gone. I had thought that maybe they combined The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned into one movie since they overlap so much-none of Lestat history so you don't understand in the movie why this gathering is so important to Lestat and Akasha. Why she let these vampires live. The portrayal of Lestat looses all the contriversaial casting of Lestat that Tom Cruise gave it. Despite trepidation and after many viewings Tom Cruise played the Lestat that LOUIS DESCRIBED perfectly. The self doubts that Lestat occasionally describes in himself are never described by Louis.Irregardless if you love the books or collect the books or movies go ahead buy Queen of the Damned-but keep the shrink wrap on.
2,Poor,I thought the film was supposed to be amazing and actually related to the book. I found the acting rather poor with vampires who couldnt even act or look vampirey...Lestat had a few good moments and so did Aaliyah...Marius and all the others are a disgrace. It turns out that the only thing the book and the film have in common are the names. I can't believe Anne Rice allowed such a mess be shown.Even though it had so many mistakes I believe that Interview was thousands of times better than this. The music though gives it a major plus...so better buy the soundtrack than the DVD.
1,Don't watch! Read the book instead!,"This is the worst movie made from a book I've ever seen. They left half of the book out. There was nothing about the vampire early history and that was a major part of the story. I also think they did a terrible casting job. Lestat, Marius, Maharet and Akasha were not even close to their characters in the book. Jessie was only one that came close. And Marius didn't make Lestat a vampire! I suppose if you hadn't read the book then the movie would be ok. But the book is so much better!"
1,Highly disappointed.,"I'm a gracious fan of Anne Rice, and as said before they hacked the book horribly. I anticipated the release of this movie, because i love the vampire chronicles. Yet on opening night they just killed it. I bet the movie was great for those who never read the book or loved it. It bothered me that Marius was said to have made Lestat. Or that they never made a reference to Louis or Claudia, saying he was always alone. Or the time he spent with Armand. Where was Mekare... The ancients were never named in the movie. Something else agitated me was the fact is that they made it a love story of Lestat and Jessie..Oh well, I know I'm not alone in my feelings. Not that the movie was all that bad, but I just really loved the book..."
2,Save your money,"If you are a real Rice fan, this movie will leave you upset. Aaliyah's acting stunk, really. They left out so many important things. It was nice to see Jonathan Davis of KoRn having a cameo in the movie as a ticket scalper. It didn't seem ""real"" like Interview did. Rent it but don't buy it."
2,Had she survived.......,"What makes this movie get any kind of press, good particularly is the death of Aaliyah. Had she lived, it would've been panned as teh horrible film it is. because she died, restraint was shown and curiousity picqued to see it. It's a bad movie. No really bad. I give 1 1/2 stars for gumption alone. The other half, I give for Aaliyah's attempts at acting."
2,Horrible Adaptation,"I was excited that this book was going to be turned into a movie because I had started reading it and loved it. I finally saw the movie and it was completely off!And characters were missing.Some scenes were really good like the one where Jessie was given the choice in becoming the vampire. But the death of Akasha was awful! That was the most ruined scene in the whole movie. UCK!If they make another movie out of any of Anne Rice's books I pray that they read it and remember the plot and any other important facts so that another mishap like this doesn't happen.But on a brighter note, the performances of Stuart Townshend and Aaliyah were great. And the songs that I heard were good. But you'd have to read reviews from people who actually heard both of the CD's to know if they're good or not."
4,"Come out, come out, wherever you are...","Stuart Townsend looks so freaking HOT you could burn yourself! The movie was WONDERFUL! I enjoyed the scene where Jessie is having a conversation with Lestat about ""knowing everything"". The music also made the movie kickass! I do have to admit, there should have been more blood and guts. ""Come out come out wherever you are"" Stuart Townsend. lol"
3,*~It's not like the book~*,*~The movie wasn't at all like the book. Except for maybe about 4 parts. First of all Marius didn't make Lestat. They left out Armand and Louis and Daniel. The twins they left out and some other stuff that would have made the movie longer.Also more understand able. They probably cut parts out because Ayallia died. The movie was still good though. The special effects were cool and the soumdtrack is good. When it comes out I suggest you buy it. That's why I give this movie 3 stars.~*
4,Not Bad,"Its really a mixture of of two books, The Vampire Lestate, Queen of the Damned. It needed Tom Cruise back, but its not bad."
3,Queen of the Damed is wrong,"This movie irked me on so many levels. I didn't really care who liked which actor, or why they weren't hot. the basis of my dread is located in the script. how dare they combine so many parts of different books. Mostly, changing the characters backgrounds is wrong. Marius didn't make Lestat. I was watching the movie with my mom pointing out all the things that were completely wrong. i was extremely disappointed in this movie. it was like an MTV Music video and lacked important content."
2,Not even close to the book.,"The only similarity between the movie and the book are the characters and the fact that it's about vampires. Granted, if you havn't read the book, it's not a bad vampire movie, but for those that have, you will hate it. The entire story was butchered."
2,Okay movie IF you have never read the book,"The acting was bad, the plot had many holes. If it wasn't for Anne Rice the original story would not exsist. Unfortunately, whoever is responsible for this movie failed to do the book any kind of justice. If you have never read the book or enjoy teeny bopper movies, then there is hope for you and this movie. That is why I did give it 2 stars. Do yourself a favor and read the book if you never have. It is alot more fulfilling to say the least. I am sure Rice fans where hoping for a whole lot more."
4,Reply to: Akasha was black rather than Egyptian?,"What is ""Egyptian""?Egypt has over time consisted of joined and separate Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) kingdoms. The Upper kingdom had a Nubian (ethnically Ethiopian) population; meaning they were black.Were there black Egyptian queens? Definitely; one example was Nefertari, the favorite wife of Ramses II (aka: Ramses the Great). She was a Nubian."
1,really sucks,"OK, I knew that this movie would not be exactly the story from the books, nevertheless I was very excited and curious to see how it would be done. After watching about an hour of this movie, I had to shut it off before I started throwing things at the TV! I knew that important parts of the book would have to be left out of the movie, however I did not expect those parts to be replaced with NONSENSE. Having Marius make Lestat and teach him about the world seriously takes away from Lestat's character. The fact that Lestat had to learn about his vampire senses and powers on his own is part of who he is. Also I just can't believe Lestat would be the type to spend hours playing the violin just because he saw some girl playing it. And Jesse-WHAT??? In the book she was a strong, intelligent woman, in this movie she was reduced to a childish obsessed fan. I might not have hated this movie quite so much if I had not read the books, however I still don't think I would have given it another star."
2,How Could They Have Ruined it THAT Much?,"Whoever wrote the screenply for this movie muust have tried to find out how many waysthey could ruin the book. It was nothing like it. Annne Rice fans: Beware! Thay must have not even read the book. Mekare didn't exist, Marius made Lestat, there were no dreams about the twins, and the list goes on and on! The didn't even kill Akasha the same way. If you have never read the book then it might have been OK (Which is why I gave it 2 stars). This movie should have never been made the way it was!"
1,Anne Rice fans: avoid this one,"I could have forgiven the fact that the director obviously never read the books, and ignored important plot points, if the movie was decent on its own. Taken by itself, this movie is just bad. It's closer to a bad '80s horror flick than anything else. The only redeming qualities were the music, which was OK, and Aaliyah's portrail of Akasha was pretty good, even if she was young for the part."
2,I'm glad I didn't see this at the theater,"Even though I didn't read the book, I didn't like this movie much. Special effects were so-so, but, when Akasha did finally make a debut (not in the dream sequences/images) it seemed compressed, like they cut out pieces between her resurrection and ""death"". I know Aaliyah died toward the end of filming this, but Akasha just seemed to be shoved in at the end and only had about 5 or 6 scenes in the movie."
5,Good entertainment,"Don't know what to say about it, vampire movie.. not too much of a vampire fan, but I did enjoy this one and Interview with a Vampire."
4,good story line but the movie is alright,interview was hel of alot better but this story line is much cooler in queen of the damned.
1,Only thing similar was the Title,"I am a fan of the Ann Rice books, and this movie has no similarity to them at all. Even if you are just interested in watching a Vampire movie this is a horrible movie. I have not seen a movie this bad in a long time."
4,TAKE UP ALOT OF TIME BUT AALIYAH'S ACTING FILLED IT IN[HERL,"THE MOVIE WAS KINDA OF DULL.THEY SHOW CERTAIN PARTS THAT JUST ARE SHOWING VAMPIRES WALKING.I NEVER READ AN ANNE RICE BOOK BUT THEY EXPLAIN THE BOOK ON THE DVD.I EALLY WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE BECAUSE OF AALIYAH.I THINK SHE DID A PERFECT JOB.WHOEVER SAY SHE DIDNT, YOURE LYING.AALIYAH WAS SWEET,DOWN TO EARTH,AND KIND.AKASHA WAS EVIL MEAN AND A BRAT.SHE BRUNG AKASHA TO LIFE.AALIYAH ONLY HAD A LITTLE TIME IN IT.THEY SHOULD OF EXPLAIN MORE THAT WAS IN THE TWO BOOKS.YOU HAD TO READ THE BOOK OR SOME TELL YO U ABOUT,THEN YOU WOULDNT UNDERSTAND IT TO FULLEST.THRE SO MUCH IN THE BOOK THEY DIDNT PUT IN THERE.IF THEY WOULD OF PUT MOST OF THE PARTS IN THE MOVIE OUT OF TH THE BOOK,IT WOLD'VE BEEN BETTER."
5,Much better than the first one.....,"Okay, this was a better than the first one. Mainly due to Stuart Townsend's preformance as Lestat. His portrayal of Lestat was very good. He made sure that Lestat was a still the smug, arrogrant vampire. But, Townsend also shows that Lestat still feels underneath that darkness, that makes him a vampire. Aaliyah wasn't too bad as Akasha. Basically what happens in this movie is simple. When Lestat wakes up from his hundred year rest. He decides to reinvent himself as a goth rock singer. However in the process, he decides to reveals some of the vampire secrets in the process. Which not only angers the other vampire covens, Lestat's music manages to awake the Queen of all who are damned, Akasha. But, once Akasha is awake. She decides, she wants to feed again and take Lestat as her king!!! Now Marius and the other ancients must try and stop her."
3,This movie scares me!,"Although I haven't seen this movie, I think I may be in for a let down. I have read almost every book Anne Rice has written in the ""Chronicles"", and ""Queen of the Damned"" was definitely the best. I have waited on this movie ever since they started producing it. I also read on the net that Anne Rice had very little to do, if anything with the production of this movie, unlike ""Interview"". So, as a warning to all of the die-hard fans out there, be prepared for a possible let down. I've read part of the supposed ""script"" off of a web page & it focused too much on Lestat's band. Which was really a small part of the actual story. If Anne won't even give the movie props, I doubt fans of the books will."
1,Blechh,"One star rating says it all....zero would have been better. Rice's creative genius is notably missing and Cruise's smooth portrayal of Lestat is even more to be mourned. The only good thing about this flick is the sad last chance to the see the lovely and oh-so-promising Aayliyah, whose career was cut so tragically short."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This film ""attempts"" to combine the plots of several Anne Rice novels into one story. Unfortunately, it fails miserably in this regard. The story is incoherent and diverges greatly from Rice's novels. Any one of Rice's novels (well the earlier ones at least) could easily be the basis for an entire movie. It is beyond me why the creators of this film felt the need to butcher several novels to come up with their script. The movie also suffers from bad acting and cheesy effects. This film is pure garbage. Avoid it at all costs."
2,Not that Great,"The DVD was nothing to get ancy about, but the real crime here is the movie itself. Anne Rice's story-telling masterpiece is butchered to the point of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Aaliyah is the only highlight, and her part is only a few scenes and lines. The movie over all is a failure, but it really would have taken a 4 hour epic to cover the novel to a ""T."" I would recomend the novel over the movie anyday. The soundtrack was nice too."
1,...ANOTHER [BAD] VAMPIRE MOVIE,IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY VAMPIRE MOVIE I PICK UP THESE DAYS ARE JUST PLAIN OFF STUPID. THIS ONE WAS A DISGRACE TO THE MASTERPIECE OF A NOVEL. THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS SO CHEESY. IT EMBARRESED ME TO JUST WATCH IT. THE PLOT WAS STUPID. LESTAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE BLOND!!!!!!!!!. THE SOUNDTRACK DIDN'T FIT THE ACTUAL STORY. IT WAS JUST A PLAIN OFF DISGRACE. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE REVIEWS ON HERE AND NOT RENTED IT. PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.I GAVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GIVE 0 STARS
1,Please don't waste your time,"I'll keep this review short since most of the extreme dissapointment I felt towards this movie has already been expressed. Anne Rice is absolutely one of my favorite authors. Her books are seductive and simply wonderful, which - quite frankly - this movie is not. I felt that the film redition of The Queen of the Damned was completely miserable in comparison to the extraordinary book. If you are thinking about seeing or buying this movie, please do yourself a favor: DON'T. Read the book which is exceptionaly written and will leave you utterly satisfied, which is something this movie never could."
1,"[Stunk] So Bad, Words Can't Describe...","Ahhhh....................hhhH!(DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!)The only thing that I will care to mention is that the Soundtrack is excelent,the only good thing that came out of the making of this film."
2,Terrible merger of one good and one great book by Anne Rice,This movie took The Vampire Lestat & Queen of the Dammed and merged into on VERY bad movies.Do yourself a favor and read these two books and don't watch the movie.
1,Possibly the worst butchering of a story ever,"OK, so maybe we need to look at this movie separately, distance it as far as physically possible from Anne Rice and the Vampire Chronicles, but when it comes down to it, that is what it is associated with. And, what a shame that is. Trying to take two books, filled with centuries of information and character development, into a 2-hour movie is impossible. The fact that they could put the name of a wonderful book on a stylized music video is beyond me.I know this movie is not a follow-up to the movie, Interview with the Vampire. However, that movie showed what these books brought to life could be. When reading her books, the world Anne Rice created becomes vivid and real. And, after watching this movie, those images are nowhere to be found.Even apart from the book, this movie was absolutely horrible. I gave it a chance because I really wanted to like it, I really wanted it to be good. Unfortunately, it was a vast disappointment."
4,changed the whole story,"I really loved the movie but they changed the whole story, not everything but the main parts, like for example Marius did not create Lestat it was Magnus who then distroyed himself in the fire right after making Lestat his fledging. Jesse and Lestat never fall in love; in the movie some ancient ones dies like for example Pandora,in the book none of the ancients dies. Akasha is killed by Maharet sister Makare and David Talbot becomes a vampire by Lestat, they become very good friends. The actors were great especially Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, my main concern was that the vampires in Anne Rice books are beautiful Immortal and in the movie they did not portraid that. But overall I enjoyed the movie very much, the soundtrack is great."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I was very excited when I heard that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was coming out. The day is arrived at the theatre I got my ticket and watched one of the 1st viewings. After the first 20 minutes I wanted to scream and walk out. But...I held my seat and finished the film. There were many inaccuracies. If I had never read the books I may have liked the movie with a bit of editing. There were a lot of characters left out of the movie; Lestats Mother, Armand, Louis.... I hope Anne doesn't go to see this."
3,"5 stars for Aaliyah, 3 stars for the movie","Well, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is finally out in theatres. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie. QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is based on the book by the same name -- which was written by Ann Rice. QUEEN OF THE DAMED stars Stuart Townsend as Lestat and the late Aaliyah as Akasha. The movie as a whole was pretty average. Aaliayh's performance was excellent as Akasha. She was yet scary and evil. She portrayed the character very well. QUEEN OF THE DAMNED swirls around Lestat's life.. rockstar and all. Akasha comes in about half way through. That was another thing... I thought Aaliyah was gonna be in the entire movie but whatever -- it was still a great performance. QUEEN OF THE DAMED wasn't as deep as INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE but it's still worth checking out."
2,let's smoke crack and cast some ugly people,The guy who played Armand looked like a deformed potato. The casting must have been done blindfolded or while smoking some serious crack.
1,Wretched!,"Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the ""Dracula"" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la ""Dracula 2000."" That alone should tell you my expectations.But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star."
4,Cool movie,"This movie is one of my favorites. Although at one point it's a little corny, it's overall an awesome movie. It's definitely a plus that Jonathan Davis of Korn does the music. The music is definitely beyond great. I would recommend buying this dvd."
2,DON'T BUY IF YOU READ THE BOOK!,I'm a fan of Anne Rice and have all her Vampire Chronicle books. I loved the movie Interview With The Vampire and was really looking forward to seeing Queen of the Damned. I was so disappointed. Anne Rice did the screenplay for Interview and it was very well adapted to a movie. Anne Rice did not do the screenplay for Queen and it really shows. The book was far better. I only gave this 2 stars because I know people who have never read the books and they liked the movie. I suppose for them it was good. For me this movie totally destroyed a very exciting story. Queen is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. I just wish the movie had done a better job of telling the story.
1,Was this SUPPOSED to be based on QOTD????,"In general, the movie was pretty good. Stuart Townsend, hotty that he is, was the wrong person to play Lestat. Lestat, is blue-violet eyed, long BLONDE hair and not created by Marius! That peeved me...the music was great. acting was o.k. story line, for someone who has not read QOTD, was o.k.If your reading this, and have seen the movie already, did u know that the blonde curly haired vampire was Armand? WHAT!!Interview was a much better movie, and it stuck pretty well to the book. buy that one, rent this one!if i were you, i would watch this movie. Then go out and buy the book, and READ IT.Never judge a book by its movie... dudes im serious on that one!!"
1,Queen of the Bland,"I didn't know an Anne Rice story could translate to the screen in such a dull fashion.Not tightly written, not tautly acted, not crisply edited. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is that it's a lesson in how not to make a movie.I wish I could go into more detail, but that would require thinking about this mind-numbingly dull pretense for a film.The film it reminds me of most is LOST IN SPACE which seemed like it could have been entertaining if someone had figured out how to present it in a way that wasn't so boring.Skip over this one in favor of BLADE II or practically any other vampire drama."
3,Differs FAR too much,"I understand that movies will never be the same as the books they are based on but some of this is ridiculous. While the movie doesn't absolutely suck, it can never hope to measure up to the first movie at all. Queen of the Damned should be veiwed with the mindset that it is independent from the first movie. As a stand-alone movie with an awesome soundtrack, it isn't that bad(hence my three star rating). But for true Anne Rice fans the differences from the two novels used to make this movie are glaring. There are key parts left out and alot of story points changed. If you are a fan of ""The Vampire Chronicles"" then you should either NOT watch this or keep an open mind and watch it as if it weren't part of these stories."
3,Not as bad as the critics say,"Queen of the Damned. The film is BASED on the novel. As such, you'll either love or hate this movie. Die-hard Ann Rice fans included. Personally, I enjoyed it. The film is visually stunning and does a fairly decent job of encapsulating Rice's lengthy and involved novel. Albeit, the characters have been changed around somewhat.Many people here have also made comparisons of this movie to ""Interview With A Vampire"". Again, these are completely different movies both in style and tone. As such, I suppose the disappointment for many viewers stems from their preconceived notion that this movie would be a sequel to ""Interview"". It is not. ""Queen of the Damned"" is a movie in its own right.Indeed, if I were to choose between Stuart Townsend's Lestat and that of Tom Cruise, Townsend would be my choice, hands down. Townsend's Lestat is dark and creepy. He certainly ""brought to life"" this tormented character from the pages of Rice's novel."
2,A truly horrible movie,"This movie was horrendous. It was corny and teenybopper, with a ridiculous plotline. However, it was also incredibly funny, you have to laugh. I would recommend this movie (and I have) just for it's unintentional humour. This is not a horror movie, this is a comedy. It's fantastic, I laughed the whole way through. Apart from that, the only reason you would watch it is for it's pretty costumes, awesome soundtrack and for, of course, the georgeous Stuart Townsend."
5,the best vampire movie I've ever seen.,"When I saw Queen of the Damned, I was blown away at how well the book was portrayed. I've read the all of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, and The Vampire Lestat was my favorite. Stewart Townsend did an amazing Lesat. And Aaliyah was the best choice for Akasha. I can't think of anyone who could have done better. I was totally impressed by the entire movie: the cast, direction, plot, camera angle, wardrobe, everything. I would recomend seeing it at least twice and reading the chronicles."
1,could it possibly get any worse?,it sucks it sucks it sucksThe only redeming feature of this flick is that Townsend is frankly sexy and frequently half naked
4,Not faithful but still VERY sexy,"First of all, I put watching this video off because I loved the book so much. After months of waiting, it was finally relased on video and I rented it. I waited until about midnight to watch it, secretly hoping that I would at least enjoy the film.I sat enthralled for the entire film. Not only was the acting acceptable, the music/soundtrack was amazing. Overdone, just as the book, the movie seemed to capture the few things I really wanted to see realized, for example, Akasha comming to life from a statue.Now, even though the story is horribly flawed from the book, IE Marius is Lestat's maker, no Baby Jenks, Jessie is too young, etc. I think this does a good job of at least setting the stage for Anne's dream.Very sexy costumes and actors, with the exception of Akasha's character, this movie was pretty good. I wanted to watch this movie again and again. So, of course, I bought it and I am still pleased."
2,Good Music but a disgrace to Anne Rice,"I enjoyed the soundtrack but this is NOTHING like the book. The acting is poor,make up is great, special effects cheesy, and the voice of KORN does not FIT with Stuart Townsend.EVEN STUART TOWNSEND HIMSELF SAID THE MOVIE WAS CHEESY. IT IS ASHAME THAT THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED AS AALIYAHS LAST MOVIE.BURN THE QOTD DVD!!! GO READ THE BOOK!"
2,at least there was music,"Yes, i think that any true vampire fan would admit this was not a movie but a complete mess. It's sad really it could have been grand. I only recommend this to fans of rock music (which was pretty good)."
2,Queen of the Damned,"The 2002 screen adaption of Anne Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" is a mood film. Stylish and dark, it serves its purpose well as a chilly late-night watch. Beyond that, the film is too empty and devoid of any emotion or substance. Stuart Townsend delivers a decent performance, but again not anything exceedingly impressive. The real standout is, obviously, Aaliyah in the title role, but the late singer (who died during production in a 2001 plane crash) doesn't appear until a good hour into the film. She doesn't do much acting- plenty of sexy moving, devilish looks- but she still manages to steal the film (which poses a problem right there). Not a straight-out horror film, not quite a suspense piece, ""Queen of the Damned"" is just another excuse for sets and costumes."
1,Anne Rice fans stay away,"Wow. There has hardly been a novel so mangled into movie form. Instead of the deep and intricate plot and character development I expected after the transformation of ""Interview with a vampire"" into movie form, I was wholeheartedly disappointed in this flick. It manages to swipe the cash out of Anne Rice fan pockets without delivering anything akin to the book. Where is the sister of the queen? Why are the facts of the book so thoroughly mangled? It is as if the people who could not grasp the first movie decided to do a pop-culture cash-grab with this movie, cashing in on Rice's fiction without giving her book any influence in teh film. Stay away, it's utterly disappointing."
1,Horrid,This movie would have been a mediocre silent film.Instead it's a holocaust of brain cells.I don't know where you get an MTV music video lacking plot or cohesion from possibly one of the most complex and entertaining books of all time.
5,I love this movie,"Hey I am no film critic, in fact I am a 40 yr old single mom, but I loved this movie it played like a dream that drew me in into a mysterious, dark, sexy world in which the music is the main character because it is ever present and it sort of flows from scene to scene like one big song. It is fluid, liquid.... magic. (If vampires existed this day and age it would suit them just fine because they wouldn't have to hide because the world has changed enough). and in the end the lesser evil vanquishes evil because in the new world it is no longer good vrs evil. I totaly enjoyed it if you want to see it I recomend you do so with an open mind."
4,dvd improves the movie greatly,"I have to say that i was disappointed in the movie itself. It was so far off the the book that it shares only the name and some of the vampires. Stuart Townsend did a great job of Lestat, but I was disappointed in the portrayal of Akaska. However, the dvd is worth buying due to all the extras. Not only do you get lestat's music videos(awesome), but you get the cut scenes of the ancients and Jesse's original dream. The gag reel and extended concert sequences are great too. I wish they would put out an unedited version of the movie to show the original vision of the directors."
2,"A Bad, Misleading Movie","I didn't read the Anne Rice novel that the movie is based on, but the way the movie was marketed, I thought that Aaliyah was the star. I was sadly mistaken. Stuart Townsend is the star and Aaliyah is only in a few short scenes. Even though Aaliyah wasn't in the movie that much, the story was not the greatest. I loved the move Interview With a Vampire, but this movie was totally off the mark."
2,A Disgrace to the Books,"I truly love Anne Rice as an author; her books are wonderful with great plots and even better characters...however, this movie just trashed it all! Every character in this movie was made to appear one-dimensional as was the story. Also, the acting was stale, not that they had much to work with since the screen play was even more atrocious. Aaliyah was decent, I am willing to admit that, but I pray that if they make another movie of the Vampire Chronicles, they ditch Townsend who just shot Lestat's character to dust. There is so much more to Lestat than blood and death; there is love and sensuality and appreciation for life and humans. What happened to our more realistic ""Interview with the Vampire"" Lestat? Next time, please let Anne Rice write the screen play!"
4,Loved It,"Although it did not follow the book, it still was quite an interesting film. I loved the goth/metal music in it and I loved how Stuart Townsend played Lestat. He was great; he acted seductively and stealthly just as the character calls for. I loved the book and the film equally and though the film was a little played out and ""hollywoody"" it still worked for me. So in other words, it was a very enjoyable film... ^_^"
2,The Queen of the Damned?,"This movie was very disappointing. I expected differences, but they went to far. Any Anne Rice fan would understand what I am saying. But, for those of you who go out to see movies for the fun of it (even if they TOTALLY disgrace the book) go ahead. There is enough gore for anyone to appriciate."
1,Not even close,"The reason they made this movie was an attempt to share some the success with that of ""Interview With A Vampire"". They did a terrible job at adapting this novel to film. And worst of all, it's not even the same as the novel they stole the name from. This is a terrible, terrible blend of two wonderful books.i love vampire movies and when i saw this, i was hoping for something worthwhile. i hadn't read the novels then, but i felt robbed when i left the theatre. Where was the depth? Were was the dark romance?Sure, it's got it's special effects and it's throbbing soundtrack. (By the way, i abhored seeing Stuart Townsend lip-sync to Jonathan Davis) i do agree that he was better pick for Lestat than Tom Cruise, but his acting was not as convincing as it should have been.i suggest you read ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" by Mrs. Anne Rice to truly appreicate this vampire culture."
3,3 stars for Aaliyah's queenly performance,"We lost a young budding talent when we lost Aaliyah. I gave her performance 3 stars, when she wasen't on screen this movie was draggy and dull. I can't believe this was her first movie appearance, she had such presence on the screen. A natural actress and that is so rare these days. She made this movie watchable I hope she rests in peace."
4,"Not good for anne rice fans, but good for other vampire fans","I would like to say first that I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it. My main reason is because I had purchased the soundtrack before I saw the movie, and became entrance with it. The soundtrack brought me into rock music and the movie brought me to books.I was disappointed with the movie after reading the book, but I think the movie can be good for people that have not read the book. I have now read the first 4 ""Vampire Chronicles"" books and I am currently reading ""The Witching Hour"". I have read all of this in just the span of a few months. Which is pretty amazing for a 15-year old.(Stuart Townsend is a member of the Talamasca in TWH. Hmm...)The movie might have killed the book, but it revived my faith in reading."
2,campy and I do not mean that in a good way,"Queen of the Damned was camp. That's the best that can be said of this bloated and unintentionally funny piece of garbage. Aaliyah did okay and the actress playing Jesse was respectable but in all other ways it was ghastly. Well, there was one good scene: Lestat and Marius admit the power of Elvis. That's it and since this was a good scene I'm betting it got into the final cut by accident."
2,It Reeks,"If you absolutely MUST see this movie, currently running on USANetwork, then watch the tv presentation-or rent it from yourlocal video store.I personally can think of a two word succinct review, and I think everyone can guess what it is, but in lieu of seeming badtaste, I shall just say ""It Reeks.""Music was hardly something that would excite the living, muchless a six thousand year sleep of a Queen. Aaliyah's actingwas poor-posed well, but as far as acting goes, forget it. AndI can't think that anyone associated with an ancient order ofparanormal watchers would get excited over some rocker vampireeither.Put this series to rest-drive a stake through it, cut off it'shead, do something so that we don't have to see anymore of thisgarbage arise like the odor off a garbage heap at night!!!!!!!!!"
3,High Expectations Fall Flat,"WOW! What a disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too high, after all, I've read all of the vampire chronicles several times. The problem isn't with the actors or the basic storyline, but what a mess. The movie had no flow. It was choppy and confusing if you didn't know the story beforehand. Stuart Townsend was quite good in a freaky sort of way and Aaliyah did a credible job as the campy vampire queen but several other actors were wasted, Lena Olin and Vincent Perez are much too good for the drab material they were given. The Leonardo Di Caprio look alike and Lurch with long hair were a waste of salary. While the actress that played Jessie was okay, a more elegant actress(such as Shannyn Sossamon)would have been more effective. In the end, the movie reminded me of the film ' Boiling Point', another example of good performances and lush cinematography wasted by bad directing and/or editing, I don't know which."
2,well...,"Queen of the Damned was very stupid. I went to see the movie out of respect for Aaliyah. Had I known that she would only be in it for 15 minutes, I wouldn't have bothered. The only reason I gave the movie 2 stars was because she was in it. She was a good actress and I give her props for the way she portrayed her character. However, in my opinion, she carried the other actors the whole movie. I personally think that if Aaliyah wouldn't have been in the movie, nobody would've gone to see it."
3,Nice Lestat at Least,"With the novels after Interview with a Vampire still waiting in my `to do' list, I had no preconceptions going into the movie. I found I liked this actor more than Tom Cruise playing Lestat, he has an effeminate/ethereal yet brooding/surly quality that one gets from Rice's novel. Watching the singer whatshername as the Queen doing her over accentuated belly-dancing/walking routine, trying to act, and maintain an accent, was painful. In all, it seemed a bit run of the mill and pedestrian, a sadly average time killer."
3,Vampires with poor character development...,"The vampire Lestat has been sleeping for decades, but he is awakened by something familiar that he enjoys, music. The music was once a part of him when he was mortal, and now he wants to reap the forbidden fruit among vampires, fame. There is also something darker that awaits him when he seeks fame through music that he so much wants. Queen of the Damned is a vampire story that seems forced through awkward character development and loose justifications of the characters needs and wants. At the end, Queen of the Damned leaves the audience with an unsatisfying cinematic experience due to poor demonstration of the characters."
3,"Good Movie, Disappointing For Aaliyah Fans!","Overall, I liked Queen Of The Damned, especially for its wonderful costuming (especially for ""Akasha""), special effects, and scenary. I had to take off two stars because Aaliyah's role (Vampire Queen Akasha) in the movie should've been more substantial. Aaliyah appears somewhere in the middle (much to fans dismay) of the film. Rather than focusing on Lestat the entire time, they should've awakened Akasha earlier and developed her character and relationship with Lestat even more. Aaliyah & Stuart Townsend (""Lestat"") did a marvelous job of acting. Aaliyah was perfect for ""Akasha"" because she has that mysterious aura to her (as a vampire does). I am sorry that such a talented individual such as Aaliyah had to pass so quickly. By the way, if you enjoyed Aaliyah's performance, her role in Romeo Must Die is also dazzling."
2,"Garbage, but with some cool music videos","Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the ""Dracula"" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la ""Dracula 2000."" That alone should tell you my expectations.But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, I give it 2 - instead of 1 - stars."
3,Pretty OK (as long you don't compare it with IWTV),"If you have read the book, as I have, OF COURSE you're going to be disappointed. The book tells (as always) a much deeper and thorough story. But, if you can look past that, and just see it as a movie on its own, it is actually rather enjoyable to see! Plus, it's got a killer soundtrack.(I haven't seen the DVD yet, but every DVD I have seen with DTS sound has great sound.)Townsend is ok as Lestat (Cruise was better), and Aaliyah makes a nice blood-queen. I just wish that Louis could have made an appearance. :)"
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!,"First of all, I must say that I am huge Anne Rince fan but an even bigger Lestat de Lioncourt fan!! When I heard that his movie was in the works, I was very excited. The Queen of the Damned, the book, kept me entralled from start to finish. Anne Rice's storytelling in this novel was flawless. I actually wept when I finished it. I knew that the movie would never compare to the book, they almost never do, but I was still excited to see what they would come up with, since Interview w/ a Vampire was a god adaptation of the book. Needless to say, I was not expecting to see the [junk] that I saw that night. The movie had blatant disregard for the book altogether. I was disgusted walking out of the movie theater. The only good thing about the movie was the physical appearance of Stuart Townsend. WHAT A HOTTIE in the movie. I do not recommend this movie to ANYONE who has read Queen of the Damned.. You will be thoroughly disappointed!"
4,Not as good as the book but a good movie,"If you have read Ann Rice's vampire series and expect to see the movie version of Queen of the Damned you will be dissapointed. The movie changes quite a lot of the story line and even some of the characters.How ever, as a stand alone movie remotely based on Ann Rice's books, this is not a bad movie."
3,"'Damned' if You Do, 'Damned' if You Don't","Considering the element of the movie, I didn't know vampires could sing. Now I know rappers aren't the only ones ripping off other artists, for example, Lestat (Stuart Townsend) is ripping off Korn's lead singer, Jonathan Davis. He sounds just like him, it's amazing... After many centuries of absorbing dust, Lestat the vampire finally decided to get out to become a rock singer? He ruined the vampire secret and exposed the world about their nature. Who cares? All of the vampires wanted him dead, except for one. Akasha (Aaliyah) wanted him to be her prince. Bad taste. She ruined the Death Valley concert to get to him (good job! terrible concert!). There was one moment though that was memorable. The scene where Aaliyah was in a tub full of roses, it was hot! I'm sure this movie was nothing like the book, I don't know because I haven't read it. Aaliyah fans may be disappointed with the small amount of screen time Aaliyah had. It was good enough for me."
3,Great for the tunes...,"The Vampire chronicles were an amazing set of books to read. They skipped the Vampire Lestat, and went straight to book 3. The book by far like many other great reads changed for the big screen, is a letdown... however Jonathan Davis did a great job with the score of the film. The original band Satan's Night Out from the book, was a smaller subject of the overall book, however was entertaining. Jonathans vocals as Lestat are hauntingly beautiful, and the addition of the video's and the extended concert sequences are great just to own, because Jonathan Davis from Korn was not allowed to release his vocals on the soundtrack album. Stripped down to the bear essentials it is entertaining. And that is what movies are made for... sheer entertainment. It is definitely worth seeing or owning if you are a fan of the music."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie is just absolutely horrible; they destroy Anne Rice's characters, especially Lestat. To all you die hard Anne Rice fans, stay away."
4,Better than critics led me to believe.,"I saw Interview with a Vampire, and enjoyed the movie. I then bought the book, and was thoroughly disappointed. I had to force myself through it, and have never read another Anne Rice (give me L. K. Hamilton any day).Therefore, I have no background on Queen of the Damned. I only watched it because of the hype surrounding Aaliyah's role.Overall, the acting was good, and I want to see more of Vincent Perez, the actor who played Marius. He really nailed the exasperated but indulgent attitude towards Stuart Townsend's Lestat.I will buy this on DVD, because the producer has written that too many well acted scenes had to be cut due to time constraints ... perhaps they will be included on DVD extras.My only (slight) gripe about the film is the title, ""A Vampire and his music: Lestat's story"" would have been more appropriate."
3,Could have been better,"I wasn't too excited about this movie, so I had low expectations. I do like vampires, and I was excited about Blade II. I had nothing else to see this week, except for ""The Independant"" (that's one hilarious movie, folks. Go see it). I found the first half of the movie quite good. I thought it was interesting that Lestat could be a superstar and be open about being a bloodsucker, and nobody really cares. In fact, I thought the movie was awesome right up to the Queen of The Damned herself entered into it. No offense to Aaliyah, God bless, she was wonderful, she played the character very well (all thirty minutes of the movie she was in anyways). But the movie took this weird turn where they tried to cram tons of stuff into 45 minutes. It's almost like they had to shorten just the last hour of the movie. Still, if your a vmapire fan, you'll still want to check this out. And God Bless Aaliyah, we'll miss you!"
2,A Very Dissapointing Movie From A V Cronical Fan,"First of all I do agree with the previous veiwer who gave this movie a one star. They ruined the story from the book. They made this movie a teens night out movie. I guess my expectations was high because of ""Interview With A Vampire"" was a excellent movie. This movie was not as classy. The acting was good but i think they should of kept Tom Cruise as Lestat. Alot of movies get ruined when they have a casting change. They should of kept this movie on the same page as Interview With A Vampire."
1,WEEEEEEOOOOOOOPLOPY!!!!!,"That, dear elves, or effing elveis as you're not often know in these parts, they hate the old as you'll see....Is the sound of this filmy wilmy falling in the basin like a fat poop. Uh did i say basin???? i missed the basin , seepage overlord prevented me from achieving my shakkka by locking the loo-bog. uhhhHHHHHHHHHHH poopy in the pantas, which leaves me to say that it stinks like an hour of my time which was spent sniffing this anal seepings which wormed out of that actress ynwi or whatever the bugf she's called. Effing elves?????EFFING ELVES over and outBEEB"
4,Good Ram for less money,"This ram works well for my g3 imac. My brother has the same amount of ram as i do, but his is all from apple. His seems just a little bit faster on opening programs. I realize that you allot a certain amount of memory to each program. We gave adobe photoshop the same amount of memory and his was just about a second faster (at most). I suggest this ram for anyone who is looking for an economical purchase of ram for their mac."
3,We wish his CD's were still available,This was also a gift---my wife things he's the greatest arranger today---if it says David Clydesdale---buy it---but there do not seem to be very many things in print for us at home.
4,Lovely execution of very happy Telemann chamber music,"I ran into Florilegium's recent cd of the Telemann Paris quartets quite by accident while buying Hannibal the Cannibal in a bookstore. They were seductive enough to draw me away from Hannibal's dinner plans; the execution of the quartests by Florilegium is a nearly flawless balance of the lightness necessary to the quartets that Telemann seemed to have understood would make them popular and the musically weighty delivery that gives them punch. The organization of the cd, alternating between the quartets and solo fantasies for the violin, flute, and harpsichord individually works wonderfully well. This cd bears playing many times."
2,Is it supposed to be doing ANYTHING?,So I purchased this for my classroom (Science lab w/ reptiles) to reduce odors and refresh the air. When it arrived it was scratched...but it arrived very fast. It has been in my science lab for 4 days and there is no difference in the air quality. If I put my face up to it I can feel the stream of air that its moving....but its extremely small. I read the instructions EnergAir sent with it...and I am doing everything correctly. I think this would work in a tiny room (like at a vet or doctors office exam rooms) but not a medium to large room like the instructions say. Bummer...I was really hoping it would work.
4,Filing made easy,This book was simple and easy to understand the steps on filing. Filing cards were very helpful.
4,TWO-BITS,"A small role for Al Pacino, portrayed with great talent. The film has a good story line though at times it had trouble holding my attention. This film is well acted and well cast."
2,Very Slow,"The content is good, but the programming is sloppy.It is unacceptably slow and there is no link from the Dictonary Side to the Thesaurus side."
2,Get the newer version!,"Palm is now selling the 11th edition of Merriam Webster dictionary, and with rebate, the cost is less than this one. It might even be in color."
1,waste of money,"This product costs you around [money] and I don't think it is worth it. It is also too slow. The content is good, but don't buy it. Check out the dictionary softwares on palm site, which would cost you almost [money]."
3,purchased,"I can't do an honest review. I have purchased not received as of yet. All cards thus far have been a five,no problems.But its not fair to the public.Asking for a review from somebody whom hasn't used it yet.I have been asked to do this in the pass. I wished I hadn't.Do you think its fair to the public?Like selling a car,knowing there may be some problems.If you sell as is,you're in the clear. By doing this,they can't come back on you. Nor take you to court."
1,Stopped working on me,"I bought this and used it occasionally for a few months. After this I found it would not work anymore, any attempt to open either the dictionary or the thesaurus just gave me a blank screen followed by a return to the launcher. Attempts to get support faile to generate any response."
4,Very functional and informative,"this is the main reason why I went with a Palm handheld rather than with the Sony models, which have palpably better picture.The only idiosyncrasy preventing me from awarding this little pack a five star rating is that it's rather slow, but this is expected.Overall this is a fine product and it sure beats carrying an incomplete little pocket dictionary or a prodigious, bulky, complete edition of Merriam-Webster's tome. Oh, and there's also a thesaurus too, but I never use it, so it would have been better for users like myself if there were a separate card option that contained the dictionary only."
3,Stirring performance - flawed recording,"The Tchaikovsky 2nd is one of those war horses that you can't help loving in spite of (or maybe because of) its overblown histrionics. Peter Ilyich knew how to get big sound from an orchestra, and Claudio Abbado knows how to make the Chicago Symphony Orchestra sing. His final movement sustains the rhythmic drive to the finish that lesser conductors sometimes can't manage. But I cannot recommend the recording, which is marred by early ""digital sound"" that sounds strident and strained in the loudest passages, although it does have great dynamic range and weight."
3,Not as expected,I like previous editions more. The price guide with letters instead of price ranges was very inconvenient to use. I recommend to buy McKeown's price guide to cameras instead. It's much better book.
1,Rubbish !,Total waste of money ! I bought all 3 of these so called Experiments in Terror sadley ! Stories were crap ! Camera work was even worse and acting was non existent !! Absolute Rubbish and the producers should be ashamed felt cheated !!!
3,"A few good tips, a pretty simple book.","This book is just 71 pages long, and though it did offer a few very nice tips for writing personal notes, such as Invitations, Sympathy notes, Congratulations and Thank yous, it was a pretty simple book that I think all of us could have come up with if we gave it a shot. The most helpful thing I found was the author's advice to send quick notes on paper for times when you just know the receiver's life is stressful, like when a family pet dies, or a person loses their job, or even for good times, a son graduates, a friend publishes a poem etc... I hadn't thought of all that. These days with electronic communication it is easy to forget how meaningful some lasting words on paper can be. You can read this book in an hour, and it does pack some pretty good advice in those 71 pages."
4,A nice companion book to class instruction,"This book is beautifully illustrated with real pictures of people holding the poses that are taught. The only issue I have with this book is that it is NOT a replacement for a real-live instructor. (I believe the authors even state that this book is not a replacement.) Also, there are is no instruction on how to modify the poses for specific injuries or how to take the pose to a higher level.All of the flows and poses are pretty basic/intermediate. There are some inversions that are demonstrated.This is a great basic instruction book for your own practice at home. I definitely would recommend this to any one interested in yoga, as long as they have a qualified instructor"
5,The Southhampton Collection - Eastern Conference Champions,"I bought this..and have fallen in love with it! Josh, Greg and Vern produced some freaking amazing stuff!! Everyone needs to buy this! ECC and their music is addictive! I cannot wait till their new album is out!"
1,I threw it away!!!,"The plastic get ""slimy"" by the end of the day when I use it for water.Also, this was made in China and according to a local testing lab, this is the kind of plastic that the FDA has said is dangerous to use in baby bottles...I don't want to take a chance and use this for my cats and dog."
2,Not all that great,"I found that I still had to use vaseline to get the rest of the makeup off my eyes, did not help me."
3,"Well it is not the one I really love,","Well it is not the one I really love, but still cleaning and removing purposes are working. But there is nothing bad about it... I just prefer more creamy texture than jelly one. It has jelly texture and clear on color, I prefer creamy texture and white color..."
2,great - but won't takeoff waterproof mascara,"I scanned other reviews for this product hoping to find anyone who mentioned whether it was effective at removing waterpoof mascara. Everyone says it's ""gentle"" and ""non greasy"" and ""non irritating"", etc. All true. BUT if doesn't even come close to removing my mascara....doesn't even make it smudge. Of course, I use an awesome waterproof mascara (tarte) that won't come off while swimming. So I was looking for a remover that could tackle that job - and this one couldn't. I do agree that it's gentle, non irritating, etc. And it's probably great at taking off eyeshadow (if you wear it)."
2,Not the style of remover I prefer,"I ordered this online and had never tried it before. In the past I had tried (and liked) oil-free eye make-up removers, eye make-up remover pads, and oil-based eye make-up removers. I was in the market for something oil-free when I found this.This remover is almost like gel. When I would put it on a cotton ball it would mush around the surface of the cotton and slather across my eye. It was very difficult to remove and left a weird film over my eyelids. I had to follow up with a hot wash cloth every time I used this. I finally gave up and gave it to a friend, and went back to my oil-free solution from the drug store."
2,Don't Bother...,"I like Sybex's idea of giving the reader 1,000 pages of info for under [price]. But this book is not well executed: there are innumerable mistakes littering this book, but the website lists only one entry in the ""errata."" And these are mistakes that can frustrate a newbie (e.g., the book says that UNIX PATH varibale has a ';' delimiter when actually it is a ':', etc.) Also, the reference section for Perl modules leaves out any mention of CGI.pm -- a very important module. Both sections leave the reader wondering just what level of expertise the authors have.I would not recommend this book."
2,Book for Advanced Reference,"This is a very dry reading. It holds a lot of information but not fit for the learning point of view, it is set up more to be a reference for the already advanced jscript/perl/cgi programmer. The layout is not created up well enough to display samples, and only makes you more confused as you get further into the book. I found myself reading pages over 2 or 3 times before one page would make sense with the next."
2,Difficult to follow,"I bought this book mainly for Perl and CGI. I found it quite difficult to follow, and had to re-read chapters repeatedly to get the main points. Even then it was hard. I think I would prefer more ""hand-holding"". I always felt I was being overwhelmed."
2,What a waste of time,"I just bought this book and read into it, and many of their examples are incorrect and they do not teach you very well. If you want a decent book on programming, try one from PeachPit Press."
2,Losing His Mojo,"Havoc's Sword is a slow, somewhat tedious read. We just never develop much of an interest in Lewerie and his activities. Old characters are brought in to bolster this weak piece. They don't. I've read all the books in the series. This one isn't close to the preceding works. Sorry Dewey but I think you mailed this one in."
2,what happen to mr. lambdin,After almost 2 yrs. waiting for this book I was very disappointed.Its the worst book so far.I was looking forward to a great read after mr. lambdins long vacation.This book sucked....
4,setting the stage...stand by,While this latest adventure doesn't have the punch of some of the earlier novels it does set the stage for Alan Lewrie's followers to have some interesting reading in the future. Very solid in maintaining Lambdin's grasp of the nautical aspects...although I will say that Soft Rabbit's son making an appearance is a bit of a stretch.
5,Havoc's Sword,"A typical Dewey Lambdin book!Much love,sex and danger.Great sea battles, usually won by Alan Lewrie. He is always in trouble with with someone, be it the British Navy, and haunted by HM's Foreign Office agents!!As usual , Alan survives battles,sex and lies!Michael O'Mara"
2,Sea sick,"While this book offered so much promise, the fact is that I found it difficult to follow and not in keeping with the rest of the series. The French characters take some time to sort out and the confusion only mounts with the author's British writing style. Historical references are used with abandon and many are incorrect for the timeline of the book. While it is a fair yarn, all I can say is that I'm glad the local library bought it instead of me."
2,Nice but received one broken,"I like the candles' aroma very much. But I was disappointed that one arrived broken. Since these candles are fairly expensive, I rated my review only 2 stars. Otherwise, they were delivered in a timely manner. Maybe something can be done about the packaging to decrease the chance of breakage."
3,A bit too light a treatment for such a topic...,"The topic is timely and worthy but this book handles it almost as a romance novel. Also the young women, all three Muslims from Pakistan, speak English like Americans, down to the catch phrases and slang, which seems unlikely, or at least takes you away from the story as you try to figure out why they would talk like that.But reading about these types of honor killings is essential and more should be written on the topic.Also, this book is very short, so the topic is handled in a rather shallow way; the main character's brother is almost too evil a villan to be believable.Still, a good enough effort."
3,holes seem big,"Just got this in the mail and I'm concerned about the size of the holes. They seem big to me... But I'm new to the world of mosquito nets... Will treat it with permethrin and report back after my Guatemala trip.Also, it's a bit bulky. When packed in the included stuff sack, it's about 6 in. long by 4 in. in diameter. Super light though.Also comes with string and a hook for hanging."
3,Not learning what I thought I would,"Don't expect to really pick up the language with this calendar. It does have some interesting phrases, and funny story lines that follow for several days, but in the end it is a lot of odd phrases that don't literally translate. Also, there is one key word with pronunciation and definition at the top each day, but it is usually not the word I end up wishing I had pronunciation or definition of from that day's phrase. It is unlikely I will get this calendar again."
3,No French track,"The DVD is really good. However, it says on the Amazon description that there is a French track. There is NOT! Neither are there French subtitles."
4,"Everyone wants a go at it, it seems.","I find it amusing how much energy has gone into disproving bits & pieces of a fictional work. Must the book bear the waiver, ""Warning: This is a novel, don't live your life by it""?The book's verisimilar approach is central to the mood that the author wanted to create he succeed wonderfully at it. To go ahead and prove Dan Brown wrong in his novel's details is silly. But wait, it sells DVDs.An interesting DVD it is, too, but it won't take away the Da Vinci Code's appeal. If anything, those who watch this DVD will be eager to read Dan Brown's book if they hadn't done so already.At the end of the day, the feeling that is left is that the DVD producers found a way to go along for the ride in Brown's huge success."
5,This Battery pack is very powerful.,I Have a Remote control bulldozer that Uses this and it can climb stairs!
5,AWESOME....WORKS WITH THE POLAR EXPRESS TRAIN SET,I bought this for the Polar express Lionel Train Set I got at Target. It worked awesome. Well worth it.
3,OK fro Overseas item,"No too bad for a item made overseas, but this is what I don't like about... it's not been able to make sure it's charging or not, since any of the 2 parts has any indicating light. Not been able to know when is 100% charged. I woudn't mind to pay few more bucks for this necesary features.I bought it to see if it would give more running time and speed to my sons's New Bright Jeep Wrangler, but unfurtanely it just gave us more running time.I went in to the web and found on Radio Shack a 9.6 Volts 2 pole battery connector (just like on the Jeep) and I completly open the main controler board and soldered a piece of the plug and I added a 2nd new Battery on the top of the Jeep connecting this 2 batteries on paralel.JeepFreak"
2,INDOOR TANNING ONLY,"These were made for INDOOR TANNING ONLY, you must lie with you head PERFECTLY STILL AND UPRIGHT for them to stay on, if you wan to tilt your face a little, no can do they fall right off!!Apparently for indoor tanning the AC blows them right off too!Not for outdoors tanning, wind, and tilting your head even slightly will knock these things straight off!The little plastic ones with holes on them stay on wayyy better.I don't feel they protect my eyes very well either! They are clear plastic with UV protection supposedly but with sunshine burning straight through them I don't think they are fully protecting your eyes."
4,Big Bottle,My order came very quickly. The bottle is huge. It will last me the whole year. I will re-order again. Makes my food taste great too. Thank you
2,It's okay.,"Good: So many goofy references to Spider-Man.Bad: No references to the Hulk.Good: The main character is Magneto.Bad: At the last minute, the final boss suddenly becomes Ice Man, completely out of the blue, and against everything the film said in the previous 90 minutes.Good: Children's Day, where the Thai government invites its most precious resource to listen to military propaganda.Bad: It's only one day a year.Good: The gunner. You'll see.Bad: Never being quite sure if you're ogling a woman or ladyboy.If the movie ended 10 minutes earlier when the gunner saves the day, I'd be giving six stars. As it is, we're given one last, unnecessary, sell-out fight scene that contravenes the entire movie. The film got greedy and I feel the need to punish it.Speaking of punishing, it's no ""War Zone."""
4,"Very informative, but dry.","This is an extremely informative book...if you can stay awake reading it. I wish it had been written a little more conceptually. There's no way anyone will remember the millions of details. Nonetheless, it's a good reference book."
4,Dvd Player,This product is just the best.The look the power and the ease of use.wow i couldnt make a better purchase.
3,Worked for a while,Well I bought the item and installed it and it worked beautiful for a while.But then a couple of months later the monitor just started to get fuzzy and I could hardly see anything on it.It appears to get this way when the receiver gets warm.Any suggestions?
3,not what i expected,"im kinda regrettig buying this but i thought it was such a good deal. i had it installed and it cost me more to install it than what i paid for it. is there any clock either? plus when i turned on my car it didnt turn on doesnt work, hoping i dont have to keep reseting it. havent gotten it to work."
4,Good value for money!,The only problem is that the radio station frequencies are compatible with the USA and not Middle East FM station (even number scan)!!!!If anyone knows any solution pls let me know. Thanks.
5,Finally! A true Thai cook and exceptional author in one!,"At last, a book that truly offers extraordinary recipes combined with someone who can really write very well. I spent over a year in the Kingdom of Thailand and have rarely been able to find any culinary author that could actually bring me back to the sights, sounds and overall sensory assault Thailand delivers on a daily basis. As a working chef myself, I can truly tell you this is one of the finest books you will find on Thailand, no other author goes into the detail of ingredients, cooking processes and traditions that make this cuisine so exquisite. I especially enjoyed the essays on how the staple ingredients are made, fish sauce, oyster sauce, dried fish and seafood, etc.. Can't go wrong here, I'm afraid Im sounding a bit biased, but this book does reign as king among my shelf of Thai cookbooks, looking forward to many more by this author"
5,Our Favorite Thai Seafood Cookbook- its outstanding!,"This is Kasma's 2nd published cookbook, the first, ""It Rains Fishes"" won an award as best international cookbook in 1996, and Dancing Shrimp continues to deliver a similar experience for anyone, from beginner to expert, who tries the dishes detailed here.Kasma's skill at providing the background and context of Thai cooking makes her books stand above other cookbooks that are merely recipes.We teach Thai cooking, and would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore cooking their own Thai food, and not just as a seafood cookbook.Sadly it is likely out of print, but well worth the cost even if you can only find a used copy!"
4,Not the best The The- still blows away any current music,"Although it is almost 15 years old, this album remains more fresh and interesting than any material being force-fed to radio listeners and MTV watchers! Still have a hard time getting local radio stations to play it during retro/80's hour. Johnson's use of all levels of language- screaming, whispering, pleading, even ""talking""- help paint vivid, and sometimes distressing images. ""This is the day"" is perhaps the most upbeat sounding of the selections and seems to offer the best advice.""The Sinking Feeling"" provides a unique combination of vocal variations and background instruments. It also delivers my favorite line ""a broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes. uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile""- The line typifies the album's overall mood... depressing, but somehow still hopeful.The cassette version contains songs not available on the CD..."
5,"Definitely, one of my favorites...","Believe it or not, I recently set up my turntable and set on the platter an original vinyl copy of this album from Epic Records. I still love listening to it (still sounds good.) I like ""Eamon O Dowling's"" description of the album below. I was curios about ""Matt Johnson"" and ""Soul Mining"" and used these phrases as keywords on Google which brought me to Amazon. It's good to know that I can get a CD version if needed. However, this album would be perfect for an SACD surround remix! I'll give it 5-stars because I enjoy the songs but, I haven't heard the CD version."
5,SIX STARS!,"This is an essential addition to any music library. Matt Johnson is brilliant on every single track. Catchy, poignant and dark are all on the order of ""Soul Mining"" and if its possible to award an album six stars ...this is it!"
5,What the The F**K?,"I can no longer recall how I stumbled upon this gem back in the mid 80s, but it was my first exposure to Matt Johnson AKA the The. Since then, I've acquired just about everything he's done. I just recently heard ""this is the day"" again, appropriately on a beautiful sunny day on the ski slopes, and realized I'd never bought this CD in spite of the LP sitting in my LP collection for the last 20 years and only occasionally seeing the light of the turntable. This is truly the The's masterpiece. On the surface, it's got a danceable beat through most of the album, but make no mistake, Matt Johnson probes and confronts every aspect of the Jungian shadow with incisive lyrics and genre bending musical influences. Guitars sound like synths and synths like guitars. The real beauty of this album is that it can be played as background music, or, if you dare, intimate, personal mind exploring journeys."
5,"Timeless, with something relevent to everyone","I'll never forget the mental girlfriend who introduced me to Matt Johnson and The The back in the eighties and, like Matt's work, she has popped up again and again during the interceding years, seemly at the most opportune moments in my life, reminding me that life is sometimes good, sometimes bad but always continues to move on.Matt's work has grown and improved over the years but this is, for me, his best work and has the unique ability to immediately bring back to mind a person I once was with complete clarity.If you've never heard of Matt Johnson or The The, then you're missing out on possibly the finest one of the few remaining true musical artists alive."
5,Distilled Damnation,"Like the rest of the folks here, heard it in 1984, never forgot ""Perfect"" (ditto about NOT having the EPs of these songs released by the record industry - for shame), especially the EP of it. Sublime - ""This town ain't getting like a ghost town - it's getting like hell"" sure about summed up Buffalo, NY for me at the time. And that sneaky, Kraftwerk like chord that bursts through to end ""Giant"", which is the basic musical ""theme"" of the album. Had some rough times in the years when I first listened to this. Last year was the worst, and now that I am 32, I understood Matt Johnson's lyrics moreso now than I did then - ""Another year older and what have I done? My aspirations have been shrivled by the sun...I've been filled with useless information spewed forth by papers and radio stations..."" Matt will NEVER outdo this! Definately a ""DID""!"
5,This fills a corner and a need,"Not much to say here, these work well with the popularAuralex Studiofoam Designer Kit Charcoal Gray. These fit just right in the corners with the kit listed above. If you are doing a complex room, you might need all the pieces that this package contains. For myself, I only needed 8-9 of them to complete my small room. At the time I did not see a smaller kit, but I'd like to see if there was a 16 piece kit for purchase.The foam material feels exactly the same as the foam listed in the kit above, feels durable, and is easy to cut for fitting certain size corners. Doesn't rip very easily unless you specifically go for it.Overall, very pleased with the purchase, I just wish I didn't have to buy so many to start with. But the quality of the product is just as good as the rest of Auralex's line."
5,Amazing and profoundly beautiful,"This is a must for anyone interested in dance, or life. Each solo fashions a different beauty, but always with Bill's forceful grace. His intelligence, as flexible as his forms, preserved here, for enjoyment and reflection. Each so different, it is hard to believe one person created them all. A true existential sojourn through the ideal and sacrifice. His dance is vibrant, beyond sincere, diverse, and gripping."
1,this card sucks,"I tend to break my wireless cards for my laptop. I had CISCO's, BELKINS, NETEGARS and they all worked flawlessly.With the D-Link the software will not even install on my WINDOWS XP laptop. When you double click it it just won't come up or comes up for a second only. I got it to work by using the native WINDOWS drivers for about 15 minutes...then it repeatedly caused WINDOWS blue screens....I talked to Tech Support but as with all network companies you get some junior person who follows a script...no help there at all though the phone was answered quickly.I have used many network vendors and D-Link consistently dissapoints me ( I have a wireless printserver that is bad too ). This was the second and last time I go for the cheap price. They just have bad products and if you add shipping and return fees and all the headache you can buy a better product...."
2,Horrible customer service,"I was trying to connect this adaptor to my laptop almost for 3 days.I was calling D-LINK'S customer service all the time I was kept on hold for more than one hour, & after that they did not give me any solution to fix the problem."
4,Works well with modern linux distributions,"This card worked out of the box on my laptop running Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon)Ubuntu 7.10 (PC Edition).It was recognized as:Ethernet controller [0200]: Atheros Communications, Inc. AR2413 802.11bg NIC [168c:001a] (rev 01)Subsystem: D-Link System Inc AirPlus G DWL-G630 [1186:3b08]Have not any issues for two weeks (in contrast to the acx100-based card I had before)."
2,Not worth the trouble,"This card died on me after about a year of use. My laptop will detect the card, but it won't power up. My reaction? Good Riddance! I now have an excuse to get a different card.As others have stated, this card uses its own drivers, and they don't work well. Everytime I woke my laptop from suspend mode, the card would fail to reconnect to the network, forcing me to remove and reinsert the card, then do a 'repair' of my connection. Huge hassle.It looks like you get what you pay for with these cards, so stay away from the cheap ones!!"
1,Causes high CPU utilization,"According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's."
2,D-Link DWL-G630 with Compaq Presario Notebook 2100,"The D-Link DWL-G630 wireless card wasn't recognized by my Compaq Presario 2170US laptop with WindowsXP, being displayed as ""PCMCIA MTD-0002"". I had to flash the BIOS, (risky for a novice?), instructions are at http://h18000.www1.hp.com/ , click on Product Support Information, and search for ""Compaq Presario 2170US BIOS"". Even after doing this, I still have to pop-out the card, and pop-it back everytime XP is restarted for the card to be recognized. Good Luck!"
3,Not Working,I bought this card for my laptop which has Windows NT Workstation 4 Service Pack 4 installed. Cannot get it to work. Keep getting an error message and when I contact D Link I get a response that says it is for Windows XP. So evidently they are not reading the information I emailed them. Have been trying to install this for 4 days with no luck.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!,"Does not consistently work! I have a toshiba a15 (Win XP Pro) and sometimes this works, but usually it doesn't. Lately, it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer. It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found, which forced me to reload the driver. But lately it's just been giving me a blue screen. I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues.D-Link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver! Bad customer service!I WILL NEVER BUY A D-LINK PRODUCT AGAIN!!!"
1,Bad Advertising,"I was looking for a cheap way to make several desktops in my home connect wirelessly to the internet.The ad led me to believe these adapters would fit naturally into all desktops.Even on the box there's a picture of a desktop in the network,however,once I opened the box and installed the disk,I found out that these adapters are for laptops only,as it says a laptop is one of the requirements necessary for these pieces.I thought the price was great,but never got to use the parts.Then returning them for a refund isn't as easy as it should be.I still have the unneeded parts."
1,Device problems with Windows XP,"Although the device appears to operate just fine as far as the network, speed, and range is concerned, the card has a serious problem running on laptops under Windows XP.I spoke today (April 26, 2004) with D-Link customer service, and they said that the card is ""new"" and may still have driver issues. Also, they are aware that under Windows XP, the card is unable to wake up after standby/hibernation. This is what I experienced with my Thinkpad laptop. So the card installs OK and operates correctly....but the moment the laptop goes into standby the card will turn off, and then when the rest of the laptop wakes up the card will not. I have to reboot to wake it up. The kind telephone representative I spoke with was hopeful about a driver fix soon. I am not sure if the problem is only for some brands of laptops or all of them under Windows XP. I think I will return my card for another brand with better drivers."
5,best product,"This product is amazing! It is really fast. Worth the price. I have tried many other products for internet connectivity but their quality is really cheap (USB adapters, ...) They started to work really fast in the beginning but then eventually over the period of a month, the internet connectivity became slow. One of the USB adapter I had even broke apart. I have this product from a while, and the internet connectivity never slowed down. The internet connectivity with this adapter is way faster than the laptop built in cards. This product is worth its price and is very useful!"
3,Overall good product,"I had used this cardbus adapter for over 3 weeks and so far, its been working great. I do not experience drop signals which I get frequently with my old USB adapter. The reason I give only 4 stars is because I have problem installing the driver on my DELL laptop computer. After checking for support documentation on website and numerous retries, I called their 'offshore support' who guide me in adjusting the computer system setting manually to get it to work. The support guy just breeze through a script, and if you are a novice, you will have problem following him as he is not detailed on the instruction. I wish they had put the troubleshooting guide on their website and save me some time."
3,Interesting Concept,"This was a fascinating book presenting a a far different, and more interesting, take on the meaning of justice than most people would form for themselves. Writing about various ages, from Mesopotamia to honour societies, from ancient practices to the formation of the modern court system, Miller presents modern justice as merely a codification of the concept of 'an eye for an eye'.Referencing sources both modern and ancient, including the Bible, the Torah, Shakespeare and Harvard Law Reviews, Miller makes his point thoroughly and often. My main gripe with this book (and the one thing that prevented me from completing it) is that it tended to become quite repetitive - I feel it could have been quite a bit shorter. Having said that, the author makes some good points and this book is worth reading."
1,A real bomb!,"E Machine Laptop heats up and shuts off and the monitor flickers. I have sent it back three times and today is the fourth time, as it continues to shut off and flickers. I have it for less than a year, and I cannot get my money back. I have written the Attorney General at their Irvine, California headquarters to try to get my money back. Let's hope that works. Ed in Philadelphia"
4,Machine Musicianship,"Rowe's Machine Musicianship is a great resource exploring the application of computing to various musical issues. Insightful, and well written. Must have for artists using csound or max."
4,Innovative ideas!,"This magazine has ""real"" product reviews, you don't feel as if they are mere advertisements. Understandable how-to's. Many ideas packed into one magazine. The CD that comes with each issue has fonts, how to videos, trial software. This new magazine is all that a scrapbooker could wish for!"
1,Better to order through the magazine itself!,"I went to Hasting's and found this magazine to see if they offered a better deal on a subscription. They do. The little cards inside the magazine offer a subscription for $19.97 for TWO years! So I'm sorry, but $15 for only one year seems like a ripoff. I Love Amazon and would much rather order through them, but this is one deal they couldn't beat!"
4,painless process,"I have only gotten my first issue, but it arrived quicker than estimated and seemed to be filled with good ideas."
4,Very happy I chose this one,Been very happy with this mag. I have had other subscriptions and this one does stand out.
1,Out of Business....Why is Amazon selling this subscription?,"Amazon should be doing its due diligence. This magazine has announced it is no longer in business and the phone number is disconnected. No notice to its customers, no offer to prorate the subscription price or substitute another Better Homes and Gardens publication. What a nasty way for Better Homes and Gardens publications in general and Scrapbooks, Etc in particular to treat its customers."
5,Keeps you busy!,So many designs to look at and get ideas from! Good price here. Always good to subscribe to a magazine and receive these surprises in the mail every month!
4,Useful scrapbooking magazine,"This magazine is one of my 'go to' resources for scrapbooking inspiration. Pros: I really like the Gadget Girls feature, where the editors demo a new gadget each issue and teach readers how to use it. I also like the page layout templates that let croppers scraplift the well-designed layouts in the magazine and adapt them to their own pictures, papers, and embellishments. Cons: I am a scrapbooker and I don't get much out of the articles on non-scrapbooking paper crafts (i.e. card-making, altered books, etc.). I wouldn't mind if they came out with a special issue on an annual basis that highlighted other paper crafts, but it is annoying to have pages of the magazine wasted on crafts that I am not interested in."
5,"Fun, Creative Energy","This magazine has it all. It's practical, creative, fun, colorful, and energic. I love it!!!"
1,Scrapbook Magazine,"Sorry, I cannot say much as this magazine subscription was a Christmas gift and I probably will never see the issues!"
2,Poor Hawthorne,"How he'd have loathed this biography by Wineapple. Invasive and outrageously distorted when it comes to interpreting what Hawthorne means in his own biographical entries [especially the letters], this volume commits the primitive biographical sin of reach a verdict, first; find the evidence, second. Some of Wineapple's assertions as to what Hawthorne ""really"" thinks [often in contradiction to his actual words] are simply preposterous. Thank God for the copious quotings from the great man, himself. The rest? Read quickly; take painkillers."
4,Black Lucas,"First you have to get used to Lucas Davenport, the quintessential Mid-American, being played by a Black man. In fact 3 Black actors have key roles. Lucas's Old Girlfriend (Can only think of her nickname which would probably not get past the censors) is black. She gets killed in this movie. Pretty sure she is still alive in the print series. Thought the actor playing John Mail, Nailed the role. Also the victims , the victim's family and assocuates were all quite good. See this with an open mind, and I think that you will enjoy it as I did."
2,LAST DVD FROM AMAZON,"Purchasing DVDs from Amazon is ""hit or miss"". MOST dvds are closed captioned (or at the very least, they have sub-titles). This title had neither. Having read the book, I thought i'd be able to keep up, but the sound quality was so poor, it was useless. The video quality was dark. I sure wish Amazon, as a leader in sales, would PLEASE LIST IF YOUR MOVIES HAVE CAPTIONS, OR NOT!"
1,Not what I wanted,I thought that I ordered the book and this DVD arrived instead. It is not a good rendition of the series of books. It is the fourth in the series and the main character was poorly cast.
4,Great fun!,People of all ages will enjoy. Liked everything from the packaing to the information booklet. The only negative is that you cannot forward the episodes and have to watch it all of the way through. (This may just be a problem with my dvd player.)
4,Fun memories!,I remember watching The Little Rascals every weekday as I ate lunch. I was late walking back to school many times because of those kids! And I STILL enjoy watching them.
1,"Whoops, was I wrong about this set","Well, I wrote the review about this set, and boy was I disappointed when I got it. I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters. 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection. The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse. Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!! I got the set, watched it< and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use. What a waste of money!!!"
1,"Vintage ""Rascals"" Get Shortchanged","RHI/Genius fell asleep at the wheel with this falsely advertised ""complete collection."" Blackhawk prints instead of the original 35mm remasters? Horse hockey! To make matters worse, ""Bear Shooters"" (1930) and ""Washee Ironee"" (1934) are the EDITED versions. So much for quality control. Hold on to your Cabin Fever videotapes until a better DVD set comes along."
3,Product review,"Most of this collection are old gang member, not aAlfalfa, Spanky, if you want to see the most famous child actors I don't recomment this collection."
1,Don't Bother!!,"What a shame this set is. Genius Entertainment did NOT restore anything. Most prints are from 35mm elements whish is great, but the image has been altered and ""blown up"" which cuts off areas of the frame. Some titles are from 16mm Blackhawk prints. I don't mind that so much, but a few like ""Little Pappa"" are from WORN Blackhawk prints. What a disgrace this Box set is. When the set first came out it was $89.95. Now you can pick up copies for $35.00, now that says something! I'll stick to my old VHS tapes."
3,Rarely seen silent films!,"Just a note to everybody:The Little Rascals / Our Gang made almost 100 films BEFORE SOUND films were in production. The ""Spanky & Alfalfa"" films you are familiar with are a small sampling of the total output of The Little Rascals. Unfortunately, that is mostly what was shown on television, so that is what most fans want.If you are looking for Spanky & Alfalfe, I steer you to these Hallmark DVDs:The Little Rascals, Vols. 1-2 [DVD]Little Rascals Vols. 3-4The Little Rascals Collector's Edition IIIIf you are looking for RARELY seen early Little Rascals / Our Gang silent films, then get this collection. Until LAUGHSMITH gets their restored 32 title ""Our Gang, Before The Little Rascals Learned To Talk"" released, this is the largest collection of silent Our Gang shorts available on DVD."
3,Blackhawk prints used for a number of the films??!!,"Some folks that have had a peek at the set report (dvdtalk forum) that 13 of the shorts have Blackhawk Films title cards, which not only means no original title cards, but that 16mm prints have been used for them! Unbelievable! Are those of us with the 4 Laserdisc sets from well over a decade ago STILL going to have to use that as the benchmark? It sounds like at least for those compromised versions the answer is yes. Let's hope that Genius Ent. corrects this huge gaffe, and replaces these. I don't know what to do with my pre-order now.....everything I had read until now pointed to this being a release from the best possible sources."
3,good for the age of it,"it had moments that weren't good, (sound and picture) but all in all it was good for the time it was made."
4,Love the Hal Roach Classics!,"I realize there are some manufacturing imperfections with this collection of Little Rascal shorts, but just the same I am very happy to have all of these two-reelers I grew up watching in one DVD collection.Next I would like to see all 40 of the Laurel & Hardy talkie shorts put into one box set for those of us who love the works of Hal Roach.We have many of the L&H; silent films on DVD, but the talkie's are few and far between and we need them assembled in chronological order and made into a box set."
4,Little Rascals Classics Delivers,"The Little Rascals: The Complete CollectionI am a Little Rascals/Hal roach fan.Although this is a wonderful addition to any Rascal fans collection it is not complete.There is a short missing when ""Breezy""Brisbane disrupts the class(with fake car horns etc.) and his penance is to read Sherwood's corny poem(we hear Breezy thinking""learn that poem"")."
3,He loved it,This item was a gift item and if the recipent was as really pleased with it as he keeps telling me he is - I would say this is the best gift I have ever given. The extra DVD on the characters seem to be even better than the episodes! An avid watcher when the series was on television he even found an episode he had never seen.
1,NOT COMPLETE,"Thre are over 200 episodes ranging from the silent reels, to the talkies. SO where are the other 122"
1,Keep your Cabin Fever VHS set,I almost got rid of my home transfers of the Cabin Fever Collection. Thank God I didn't. Why do we get Blackhawk prints when even Cabin Fever had originals? This stinks. I thought once and for all this would be the set to get. Watch out. And so called expert on Spanky can't even pronounce Alfalfa's last name. Who got him???
1,"I've seen better bootlegs than this ""Official"" DVD",Very sad. How they can misrepresent the contents amazes me. The Cabin Fever set was much better. At least they didn't use Blackhawk Films prints. Somebody at Genius certainly wasn't. Somebody over there screwed-up big time. They'd have had a hit on their hands had they done the set correctly.
1,sending mine back.unopened,"sorry to say i am returning this. i have been reading various discussion sites and this set seems to be a major dissapointment. issues include: at least 13 and counting shorts without original titles (blackhawk films reissues),sound sync problems on various shorts,scratchy prints on various shorts(worse than cabin fever releases.booklet with misinformation(eg: dickie moore being beaten to death when he is alive and well and is even seen on extras)and other various problems.genius products had their hearts in the right place but their brains were obviously up their butts.i will stick with my cabin fevers which thankfully i transferred to dvd last year."
4,Don't Let the Reviews Stop You,"I ordered this as a gift for my brother for Christmas and he is pleased with it. I don't consider the technical glitches a deal breaker and I am not disappointed. Maybe because I never ordered a Little Rascal set before. These films were far from perfect when I watched them as a child, but the memories they bring back outweigh any imperfections. If you don't have these episodes in any other format, go ahead any order it."
3,A bit disappointed.,"As much as I love the Our Gang series, I was disappointed in the DVD's. The quality of the videos aren't bad but why couldn't they include ""chapters"" so that you can get to the show you want to view? I wanted to go straight to the tenth show on one disc and found that you have to watch or fast-forward through the nine that come before it. That seems like a waste of time in my opinion. I would not recommend the DVD's based on that but I would recommend the completeness of the boxed set for the die-hard fans of the Little Rascals."
3,Are these uncut or have they been politically correct edited?,"I have not read all the reviews, but I don't want a set that is cut up to please the politically correct crowd by taking out what they believe is offensive to today's whinny easily offended crowd. I want to view them how they were made 80 years ago. Are they altered or edited?"
4,Compaired to Cabin Fever Release,How does this stack up to Cabin Fever's (1994) releases hosted by Lenard Maltin? 48 shorts in that release. Has the quality improved?
3,Selectively Agreeable,"Die-hard Rascals fans will find this collection very satisfying. For others, many shorts are merely yawn-inspiring."
2,Not as restored as we are meant to believe.,"I have started at the beginning of this collection and am imediately turned off by it. The sound has definitely not been restored. There is hissing and crackling on some sound tracks and it is difficult to understand what the kids are saying sometimes. I haven't gone through the entire set yet, so there could be better results on some of the shorts, but if you are buying this with the expectation of getting good quality prints and a good viewing experience, think twice and don't spend the money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"I agree with most of the reviews here.I also grew up with watching the re-runs on Sunday mornings as a kid, and so when we introduced a VHS rented tape to my daughters they loved them. The ""talkies"" are the only films I'd consider buying and I think most people would only want as well. There was 1 DVD missing (we had two #5 DVD's)and missing the Spanky gang #4 disk. Right now we only have 1 original ""talkie"" and the rest documentaries and silent movies. I believe the company who produces this DVD set should be ashamed of themselves. They plaster Spanky's images all over all the videos and then we don't even have one of him!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO (unless you like silent movies and bad documentaries) with film qualities that were bad copies (that are hard on the eyes!!!!We're taking this one back and damanding a refund!!!"
3,Not as good as it should have been,The one thing that I like about this version is that the episodes are in order of release so one can watch the evolution of the series from beginning to end. I have owned the Cabin Fever VHS version for some time and each tape contains episodes from various parts of the series and not in release order. What I don't like about the DVD version of that several episodes contain the Blackhawk credits and not the Hal Roach credits and the picture and audio quality on some of the episodes is inferior to that on the Cabin Fever version.
3,Great collection! For TRUE fans only!,"The other reviewers for this product have no idea what they are talking about and are not true fans of the OUR GANG series. Just because you haven't seen the characters before, or because they are silent doesn't mean they aren't any good. That's just plain ignorance. If all you care about from the OUR GANG series is Alfalfa and Spanky, then you have much to learn about being a true Little Rascals fan. You might as well stick with the crappy 1994 remake while you're at it.This collection has some VERY RARE silent classics of the original gang, including the classic baby Farina, who is arguably a much more adorable character than Buckwheat. People don't realize how amazing it is to have these gems restored the way they are in this collection. The collection of films in this DVD are hilarious and fantastic! This is for the TRUE Our Gang fan only. I would give this DVD 5 stars if it weren't for each disc being an hour long and for the unnecessary fifth disc."
5,FUNNY!!,If you need a laugh watch this. It's amazing how funny these little kids are. And they're all so cute.
5,Worked fine out of the packaage,"Worked fine out of the packaage when used with my brand new iPad Mini hooked up to my 4 yr old 13"" MacBook laptop. No issues whatsoever."
3,It worked,"This stuff is very very very thick!!! Be aware of that. It takes a long time to apply to the skin, but it does stay put and you literally have to scrub it off. It has made a difference in the skin issue, but it did not solve the problem."
1,Opportunistic Jerk,"I just watched the beginning, and then I had to stop and do some research. The beginning of this show tells us that Mike Epps did this show in Detroit during the ""heart"" (whatever that is) of the depression. He pointed out that Detroit was the most hit by the economy's downfall, and he pointed out that he sold out two shows of 10,000 people each.I guess his point is that even during a depression, people will pay money to see him.The message I got was, ""I'm going to point out the depression at the beginning to make myself sound like a good person.""The jerk didn't give a PENNY back to Detroit. Don't give him any more money for this opportunistic ego-tripping jerk.I *did* sit through the entire show. His jokes are in the same vein as countless other comedians--nothing original. Frequently, one item (such as the offensive ""heartstrings"" attempt at the beginning) can make or break a movie or special. For example, where would ""Psycho"" be without the shower scene?"
5,Mike Epps is a Crazy Brutha!,"This Man had my stomach Hurtin! This type of comedy may not be for everyone but I will say this, you will watch this movie again, and again! My favorite bit was about the Handicapped Singer, ""Baaabyyy,you know I Love you"", when he ask the crowd will he go to hell for this and they said,Yeah.respoinding back with ""Ya'll laugh too"" , totally hilarious! So for those who will think that was rude,I just have to say.""Leave Me Alone and Git Out Of Ma Face""!"
4,He really has a hit with this one!!!,"if i want to lol i pop in this DVD. Its cool for all. My favorite part is where he says music has changed. and he wanted to fill in Detroit the home of Motown, ""so how did we go from 'if i ever lose your love' to 'i was gettn some head, i was gettn some head'?!""he doesnt do racist jokes, if anything he clowns around with the people in the crowd superbly.and let me not forget. the artist who opens for him is non other than Doug E Fresh!!!!!!!!nuff said."
3,youth minister's point of view,This is a good read. It is pretty common sense and those of us that have many years invested in youth ministry will find it full of reminders that we tend to forget ona day to day basis. Good reading for a newbie as well.
3,oh well,"Would not have ordered the western songs as I don't like western songs, but wanted Christmas in High Fidelty enouogh to buy this CD. I will just skip over the western ones & play the Xmas ones. Wish his Music for Relaxation would be issued in CD form-the songs are wonderful & his renditions so beautiful. GKB"
3,Terrible Combination!,"Under Western Skies was a LP record that my family played until we truly wore it out. Great authentic western tunes in a soft - Sunday sorta style. It played well when Dad would load it with 7 other LP's by Michael LeGran, M. Gould, Eugene Ormandy, etc. We would have a couple of hours to read the Sunday paper and enjoy the family.Now, I love Christmas. But Christmas and soft ''Western"" have absolutely nothing in common! I understand how the companies want to jam several LP's together to save money...But would YOU want the western tunes at Christmas? Or the Christmas tunes the rest of the year? No way does this work. What a shame."
5,This Nursing Diagnosis Manual is GREAT!,"I found this book to be so helpful. Although, it's a slightly older edition then the current one avaliable, it still got the job done."
5,Beautiful desk blotter,"This desk blotter was exactly as described and packaged well so that it would not be damaged. It is well crafted and looks beautiful on cherry desk. I was afraid it would not be worth the money, but I am well pleased with it. Highly recommended!"
5,Pricy but impeccable,"This is much larger than I imagined. Impeccable quality, as is to be expected by Bosca products. The center piece is not leather, but it's durable and not tacky even when juxtaposed next to such great leather.If you order from their site, you'll pay more but you have the ability to monogram it."
3,Why is 'Perfect' missing??,"I think it's great news that Matt Johnson's classic 'Soul Mining' has been digitally remastered after all these years, but WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH is the song 'Perfect' missing?? Seriously. One of the best songs on the record. I don't understand what the thought process was there. For that reason, I may just skip buying it all together. I don't really care that that's how Johnson wanted the original track list to be on original vinyl release. That's how the buying public knows this record, and he really took a misstep by not including it. There's NO WAY I'm the only one who feels this way."
5,Jools Holland solo rocks on Uncertain Smile,"When you begin listening to Uncertain Smile, you cannot fathom the tasty treat tied to the end of this poppy little song. From the moment Jools Holland starts playing the piano solo, you can't help but get up and start dancing like a fool. Honestly, and not just because I love the piano, this is music that grabs you out of any funk you might be in, a real uh-huh moment."
5,Soul,"THIS ALBUM IS A DEEP LOOK INTO THE TORTURED SOUL OF MATT JOHNSON YET IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST SOUNDING COLLECTIONS OF MUSIC AVAILABLE. THIS STUCK IWHT ME 20 YEARS AGO AND HAS NEVER LEFT. INCREDIBLE. NOTHING AFTER THIS EVEN COMPARED I THINK,."
1,Not Perfect,"What the (the)? I get all happy that one of my all-time favorite albums has been remastered, so even though I already own the original CD, I purchase the reissue. However, when I pop it into the CD player I realize it's missing the BEST SONG! Sure, ""This is the Day"" and ""Uncertain Smile"" are incredible, but they can't match ""Perfect."" It's, well, perfect. The fact that it didn't make it onto the reissue isn't just too bad, it totally ruins it for me. I feel cheated out of my favorite The The song. Guess it's back to the old CD...."
3,"Disappointing, ish","I loved the style of the author. Reminded me very much of P. G. Wodehouse, one of my favorite British authors. But the moral standards of the characters were not very high. Entertaining, but not recommended necessarily. Still, it is free, so I'm not upset that I had to pay for a somewhat disappointing story."
3,Nice but over-priced,"The only reason I purchased this was because I wanted a plain white eyelet dust ruffle to match the comforter we had for our daughter's crib and for some strange reason I couldn't seem to find one ANYWHERE else, apparently they aren't in high demand. If I had more time I would have made one myself and saved the money."
1,ZIP 250MB Starter - 3 U250 Disks not included,"This starter kit doesn't contain the U250 disks (10 year guarantee), but the regular 250 MB zip disks (5 year guarantee). I am sending 2 kits back today. Iomega quit making the U250 Zip disks. Someone at Amazon knows about the problem, but the website has not been updated. Don't waste your time !"
4,Great buy,"I bought one of these a few months ago, it was one of the best decision I ever made haven't regretted it. I use it with both my PC and notebook with the same satisfactory result. It's fast to the save every time, and comes with pretty imteresting tools. Comparing a floppy to the Zip250, is like comparing a 50's Studabaker to a 2001 Mercedes."
2,Beware of 100 MB Disks,You should be aware that 100 MB Zip disks are read and written VERY SLOWLY in this drive and I keep getting several errors when writing to a PC-formatted Zip disk on a Mac. This same information could be written from a Zip100 drive to the same disks with no errors. Just don't be fooled into thinking that the 250 is completely backwards compatible with 100 MB disks. There are limitations.
2,Etz Hayim,I consider this to be one of the finest torah translations and commentaries written. It is a pity that the travel edition font is so small as to be unreadable without a magnifier It would have been far better to see it produced in two volumes in a larger more readable font size.
5,A wonderful handbook,"This commentary provides a real insight into Conservative Jewish thought on the Torah; with both a contextual commentary and a second midrashic commentary.I sincerely hope it will not offend the Jewish Community to say that as a Christian, wanting to have a greater understanding of the Jewish roots of my faith, it has been a wonderful book to use.For those who have not yet begun to study Hebrew - and even those, like myself, who are only just learning to read Hebrew - turning the pages from left to right (and reading the right hand page before the left) may at first prove challenging! But I'd encourage perseverance.Highly recommended for any Christian who really wants to see their faith in context, and to comprehend the many nuances of the Torah."
3,"print is too small. thiugh ourchased used, i didn't expect one of the books to have the cover come off.","Though i purchased used books, 3 of them were perfect, the 4th had labels on it and the 5th also had labels all over it,was dog eared and the cover was loose.Also, I did not expect the print to be so small. Older ladies are reading this for a study group and have to use a magnifying glass."
4,"Great Commentary, Small Print","The Etz Hayim Chumash has great commentary accompanying the fine JPS translation. But this ""travel size"" is extremely difficult to use for those of us with aging eyes. The commentary/notes are in a print size that not even my bifocals comfortably deal with. What I do not understand is why the full size Etz Hayim is unavailable except through the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly at Jewish Theological Seminary. It makes no sense. I would have purchased through their website were it not for the fact that they wanted to charge me an estimated $20 for shipping, which is absurd. Why such a major work is generally unavailable despite being in-print is hard to understand. But if you can find one, a full size (which, in addition to being easier on the eyes, contains scholarly essays that the travel size does not), it is definitely worth the effort."
4,birthday gift,"for my 3 year old grand-nephew, cute book popups are colorful and fun, he sat down and looked thru the whole thing then tossed it to open other stuff lol"
3,Best of Ronnie Earl,"I was a little disappointed. I based buying this on hearing Ronie's ""I Smell Touble"". I didn't realize that Ronnie doesn't sing. I thought the vocal on ""I Smell Trouble"" always sounded familiar and that's because it's Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds.I thought most of the songs were uninspired and the playing was lackluster. I myself am a guitar player of forty years, still performing and I play better, no disrespect meant, than Ronnie Earl. Buy a download of ""I Smell Trouble"" but I wouldn't recommend this CD."
3,Mixed Emotions on this one but its the best of the Gabriels!!!,"With no particular order, I don't like the fact that he addresses the audience and changes some lyrics to French! Who bought more copies of your concerts??? The U.S. or France?!?!?!? Anyways, this does contain the BEST collection of Gabriel songs out of the concerts I could find. I have not listened to the other concerts but from reviews this offers the best selections. So unless you want to buy all of them, this is a good buy for the money. Its just not great!"
4,PDC-5070BD,This camera is truely a point and shoot camera. Very simple to use. With 30 seconds of instruction anyone can use this camera. It provides very nice resolution and picture reproduction. Remember this is a camera priced under $100 so it doesn't have the features of the $500 plus cameras. It is very easy to down load the pictures with the USB cable that comes with the camera. You need to upgrade the memory card if you want the video capability of the camera.A great value for the price
2,Boring and Predictable,"I find this movie a big disappointment, esp. after seeing Lumi in ""Like Water for Chocolate"", I thought this would be a good one too. I've seen dozens of Spanish-speaking movies and were quite impressed with most of them so far. I've enjoyed ""All About My Mother"", ""Open Your Eyes - Obre Los Ojos"", ""Like Water for Chocolate"", ""Jamon Jamon"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", ""Nine Queen"" and a few others.However, I find this movie to be quite boring and predictable in the plot. I correctly guessed the person behind the murder in the early part of the movie. Then I have to endure all the stupid story to confirm my prediction. There are no profound messages that audience can learn. Overall, I've wasted about 1 hr 45 min on a boring movie."
5,Awesome First Movie,"""For Catherine"" brings humor and sentiment to the TV screen in a poetic waltz. This first production by 207 pictures develops the theme of the romantic comedy through the backdoor via a sensitive, witty young man eperiencing his first true love. The movie elicits laughter from the outset, ofttimes iced with tears. I look forward to more productions from such a talented new director and crew."
5,Wonderful Smell,"This sachet smells great. I used it in my underwear drawer, but it's great for sweaters and other things too. It's a good size-bigger than it looks in the picture."
3,Not very accurate,"I have a nearly identical Invicta Automatic that I bought for a similar price. It gains at least one minute every day. That's 7-10 minutes every week -- not very good. It looks OK, and the price was fair for what I got, but the metal bracelet/band is kind of thin, and the pin holes where it attaches to the watch case are very obvious. In retrospect, I would have bought a more expensive version with a good swiss movement -- I understand that Invicta makes better versions with better mechanisms."
2,what a disappointment,"If you are looking for what we've come to expect from the ""Rolie Polie"" gang, look again. My 2-1/2 year old is a big fan of ""Rolie Polie Olie"" and was very disappointed in this movie. The animation, for some reason, has lost its computer-generated fluidity and is a jittery headache to watch and the usual slow-paced and charming writing is gone and been replaced with your standard good guy/bad guy conflict and lots of frenetic racing around. Everytime ""Gloomius Maximus"" came on, my daughter asked me to fast forward it because he scared her. Eventually, my daughter picked up one of her books and wandered off... Hmm..."
2,Painfully frenetic,"My two-and-a-half year old loves Rolie Polie Olie, and I have to admit that I enjoy the show too. Unfortunately this DVD is so hyper that it is painful to watch, and even my son seems not to like it that much. We both enjoy the action on the TV episodes, but Great Defender of Fun does not have one single second that is not completely filled with a hundred different things tearing around the screen as fast as they could possibly make them. Moreover, the bits where Pappy's ""happy gear"" repeatedly breaks look like someone having a massive heart attack. To sit through this for an hour plus is headache-inducing torture."
1,disappointing,"My 5 year old eagerly awaited this video but was very disappointed when he watched it. The villian was ""too scary"" for him and it seemed to drag on and on for me as an adult. I don't recall the TV show as ever having villians like that. It was always a light hearted sweet show. Needless to say we won't be viewing this one more than once."
2,Not in the same spirit as the TV show,"My 4.5 year old LOVES Olie, but finds this movie much too scary. It has a dark side that isn't usually part of the up-beat, happy show we see on TV. I've wondered if this movie and the TV episodes were created by different writers, they're so different from each other. If your child is sensitive to gloom and doom you might think twice before getting this movie."
2,A little too busy,"A real effort went into this production, to be sure. Perhaps too much. There's just too much going on here to take in - the story is too complicated for Rolie Polie - too many characters. Great Defender lacks the sweet simplicity that makes the episodes so special."
5,Fun!!,My 4 year old who is a Rolie Polie Olie fan was very excited when this came out and has watched it numerous times now with great enthusiasm. Lots of fun action and story line! Good music and a Stanley story at the end makes this a good buy.
5,My 3yr loves it!!!,"We were given this dvd and my daughter loves it!!! Tired of watching it myself, I bought a few of the other Rolie Polies and she hates them. This one is exciting and adventurous while the others that we tried were just boring."
4,"A book that catches you ""in the path"" of emotions.","Carolyn Brewer does an excellent job of putting the reader in the path of the deadly Ruskin Heights, Missouri, tornado. The tales from the survivors are timeless and should be remembered each Spring. It is a sometimes sad, yet beautiful story of a community coming together under catastrophic circumstances. Brave men, women and children who, after losing everything to the most violent temper of nature, form as one to rebuild. This is a MUST read for anyone living in ""tornado alley"" which, given the year of El Nino, has expanded its right-of-way. DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Very Smart and Well-Written,"I came to the book expecting more of a horror novel, based on the cover art and the jacket blurbs/description. What I got instead was a book that takes the bigfoot/sasquatch legend seriously, assuming that such creatures must exist, given all the evidence which has accumulated over time, as well as an ongoing argument about the effect of the Endangered Species Act, should it ever be proven that such a creature does in fact exist. There are powerful forces out there whose interests would not be served by such proof. Even though the focus isn't so much on the horror, this is still a fast-moving and scary book, which is very atmospheric, with great descriptions of the settings and locales. Although the book does at times threaten to become more of a lecture (hunting is good, the government is bad), it is still a very entertaining and thought-provoking novel, and a real page-turner, too."
5,"Chilling, you may think twice about what is out there!",A great read. What is nice here is that this book was obviously written by an outdoorsman for outdoorsmen. If you enjoy the woods (and what may be in them) you will enjoy this novel. Also nice to see a true hunting story without the usual Hollywood P.C. spin.
4,Just read it again..,"I did not care much for this book the first time around, but upon a second reading I have changed my mind. Mr. Kumar did his research."
2,not the best........,"the sad thing about thes tape is one resone, didnt bring the best epsodes in the sesone. if they brought at lest the last 3 ep. in the show mapy then......."
3,It lasts 4 four hours and that's okay.,"It took about 4 hours to complete this game on the easy setting. I found the graphics quite good, especially if the advanced options are set to the max. Since it is a 4 year old game, present day computers have no problems with that.You only get to carry 2 weapons at the same time. I mostly used the Lawgiver. It is a ""do-it-all"" gun with multiple kinds of ammo like armor piercing and incendiary. The enemy is subpar though. You get to kill undead, vampires and death cultists and their only strategy is to rush you or shoot you in plain sight. They are cannon fodder. I expected a little more from the bosses. Of the four of them, you defeat three without firing a single shot. That was disapointing.The levels are big and there is some semblance of choice to get to the final objective but it is pretty linear. For the 4 hours that the game lasted, it was fun but I felt a little bored at the end."
3,Expensive for what you get,"How much can it really cost to make these things? They work just fone, but they seem expensive. This may be partly to blame on me LOOSING them too often!"
5,Beautifully written...,"I don't expect computer books to be well written. I expect them to be straightforward and dull. Mr. Steinberg's book is a refreshing change. Not only is it carefully crafted for readability, but his subtle touches of humor are a refreshing change.The book is a great introduction to Mac OS X Jaguar for users of the older Mac systems. It made installation and setup a breeze, and I welcomed the extensive troubleshooting chapter and the introduction to UNIX. The only quibble I have is that some illustrations in Chapter 3 are mislabeled, obviously a production mistake. The book is nonetheless a great read and extremely informative. Highly recommended."
3,My 3-year-old liked it.,"The first story on the tape is about Kitty's mom babysitting a neighbor's baby. Kitty feels left out, etc. Not a bad story. The second episode is about Kitty's twin sister, Mimi, meeting the new boy in the neighborhood. The dialogue is a bit sappy, but appropriate for ages 3 to 6. Check out the review for Kitty's Christmas video."
3,Occasionally funny but hardly 5 stars,"I guess everyone's giving this 5 stars for camp value, but it's a plodding, stupid film whose only redeeming feature is its ridiculously over the top treatment of its subject matter.Warning: probably not a lot of fun to watch while taking your own voyage. Funny in a reefer madness kind of way, but don't get too hyped up by all these great reviews. It's really a pretty dumbass film.Clearly made as a caveat against tripping, it comes off more as a caveat against Hollywood's remarkable ability to take any subject matter and make it seem trivial."
2,"""The Big Cube"" ...is empty!","Forgettable Lana Turner late career star vehicle in a ""Gaslight""-goes-psychedelic sort of vein.Big Studio turkey attempting to cash in on Sixties subculture (at least the way the producers understood it...).Even after 40 years too corny to gain cult movie status, only trash film-completists need apply.Film: 3.5/10Picture quality: 7/10Aspect ratio: 1.78:1 (1.85:1 orig.)Run time NTSC 60Hz: 1 38'06""Audio: GBST: GB;FChpt.: 27RC 1Bonus: TrailerStudio: Warner"
1,Don't Buy This Unless You Speak Japanese!,"When I bought this CD I assumed it had the Coca Cola commercials as sung by different groups like Jan and Dean, Roy Orbison, etc. What a major bummer when I received the CD and discovered, with the exception of four, all the commercials were in Japanese! Nowhere in the description of the CD does it say these are commercials sung in Japanese by Japanese artists! The worst thing is I spent over $40 for it. Oh well. You know what they say about when you assume. That statement is so true!"
4,4WD vehicle review,"This 4WD vehicle has built-in engine piston structure, gear pulley, spring suspension, and can travel on any uneven surface easily. Highly recommended for mechanics and 4WD enthusiasts."
1,"Boring and dull, do not buy it","This cd is one of the worst cds I ever listened to. It is repetative and unimmaginative, just plain boring. No depth nor essence to it. People who gave this cd 5 stars have no taste, not even a bit. If you want to listen to something challenging and innovative check out Weather Report."
3,nena,I liked the album but the 1st track has been redone. its not the same as it was on the original recording. I was kind of disappointed as this song (99 red balloons) was the reason I bought the album. the rest of the english tracks are still as I remember.
5,Really good,"I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to buy some German music. It's a great cd, fun to listen to and fun to dance to."
2,CD has lame remix of title track.,"Agree with the reviewer just before me. The rest of the album is okay. Nothing special, but I wanted the album for the English and the German versions of ""99 Red Balloons.""I'm still trying to find the parody by Tim Kavanaugh (spelling?) entitled ""99 Dead Baboons"" as well, but that's another story. The point is, I didn't want someone mucking around with the original song. That they remixed it so poorly only makes it worse. Stupid. Just a stupid thing to do. At least they didn't mess with the German version of the song."
5,great sounds,great tunes i really liked the cd and the group especially the song about elephants. up yours with this nazi word limit i either write what i feel or nothing
5,Still sounds great - in either language,"I've loved ""99 Luftballons"" for years and now my 16 year old does too. This album is full of songs that have a wonderful, energetic beat and are just plain fun. A large majority of music from the same era is definitely past it's prime, but Nena still rocks in English and German."
5,Excellent musical choice,"99 LUFTBALLONS was a terrific buy! It was completely satisfactory music, and brought back some memories. Thanks!"
4,Classic 1980's Euro-pop,Nena has enjoyed a long and productive career. The title track from this song became a worldwide sensation.The music is not complicated musically and is very synthesizer-centric. For the most part it's feel-good music with an occasional piece of socio-political commentary.
5,It's Our Song.,"My boyfriend and I went over the lyrics of the song very carefully. The balloons go on a voyage around the world back to the place they started from, risking starting wars and national panics, to make the world an all around better place. We chose it as our song for that reason. If those balloons can last, why can't we??"
3,Sprechen Sie Deutsch?,"I have not heard all of the songs yet, but I loved what I heard of the English ones. My true passion would be 99 Luftballons, the German version! I have heard the English version and for some reason it does not have the power to reach down into my soul and all that changing-your-life electricity which the German version has. Then again, English is often a blah language to me and I wish my first language was something else. Like Deutsch! O ja! Das ist meine wunsch."
4,Power Rangers Wild Force,"This video has the following episodes of Power Rangers Wild Force:LIONHEARTA young man named Cole leaves his home in the wilderness to find his real parents. His journey leads him to the Wild Force Power Rangers, where he joins them in battling the evil Orgs as the Red Ranger.DARKNESS AWAKENINGMaster Org resurfaces, and begins plotting the destruction of mankind. The Rangers discover that they can combine their Wild Zords into the Wild Force Megazord.CLICK, CLICK, ZOOMThe Camera Org makes Taylor (Yellow Ranger) invisible. Cole races to defeat the monster to restore his teammate, as well as other citizens who have been zapped.These three episodes are filled with action and suspense. Power Rangers Wild Force is one of the greatest Power Rangers incarnations that I have ever seen. Buy this video. You won't be disappointed."
3,Power Rangers can do better than this,"Disappointing opening video for Power Rangers Wild Force, but it does show promise. Time will tell on how better the show will become."
3,Seductress Susan,Susan Lucci is cast to type as a scheming socialite who makes life miserable for the married lover (David Charvet) who leaves her.For all you lovers of Lifetime movies.
3,OK but not the best sports bra I've owned,"I bought this because my favorite everyday bra is a Natori, so I thought this would be a good one to try, and I couldn't resist the price. (see http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007N2C3I/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)Pros: large band with comfy fit, adjustable straps, nice cut at top of cups so doesn't peek above a low cut workout tank.Cons: made mostly of cotton, so it doesn't wick well and I stay wet if I sweat a lot; though the straps are adjustable in back, the tab hangs out on the shirt side instead of on the inside closest to your skin -- really odd; support is best for low-to mid-range activities -- I wouldn't run miles in it.So far my favorite sports bra is the Wacoal Sport Underwire Bra (#855170), it's great support, super comfy, wicks moisture and has great adjustable straps. The only downside is that it's a full fit so it peeks well above my workout tanks, and it's pricey."
1,This valve does not have a flow control valve,"BEWARE - the picture online clearly shows that this has a flow control device. IT DOES NOT. The model number for the correct one is DAS ASVF100 (for 1-inch) not the DAS 1, but I'm not sure that is what I would get if I re-ordered so guess I'll go shop Home Depot. Amazon should change the picture."
2,As a student using this textbook...,"This is the subject I least look forward to doing. The information isn't bad (Although maybe bias, without much to compare it to, all I can say is that it does sometimes dis other governments), but the repeating, slow, and dull way it is presented gives me a headache. I find it very hard to concentrate on the reading, and the questions are always the same idea (Why was person X way better then person Y? Write what YOU think about person X's decision), or just don't make sense (In your own words, describe why Apples are better then Cars.)"
5,Almost perfect,"I've used several of these to mount cameras, and they are a dream. Easy to tighten and loosen, and they hold position very well. Two things make them less than perfect: each individual joint has only a limited range of motion, so you may have to think ahead and adjust both joints in concert to get the angle you need; and, they only hold position nearly perfectly, not perfectly. It's still possible, when bumping one, to move the position a tiny fraction of an inch."
4,Diverticulitus - An informative book on this disease,Diverticulitus - This book was very imformative on the digestive process.I found the author to be straight forward and explained every detail. Iwould buy this again. It has helped me. BobbiLynn
3,Too much ax grinding,"This very short book has some good suggestions regarding diet and exercise to relieve diverticulitis. Unfortunately, the author spends too much time bashing the standard medical system and extolling the virtues of naturopathy. In addition, the suggested diet is going to be too spartan for most folks to follow long term unless they are already into ""natural"" foods. If you can find this book for a couple of bucks it might be worth while, otherwise you can read just about any book on natural health and get the same infomation. Just eat whole foods and walk. And if you aren't willing to go that dietary route then it is not worth your time or money."
1,Generally disappointing,"This book is not what I expected. It is new agish, and aimed at people who are frankly neurotic. For instance, part of the program emphasizes sponge downs and friction rubs. Some of the suggestions are outright dangerous; for instance, enemas, and meals high in nuts and seeds. If you have an acute flair, by day 3 you should be eating ALL FRESH FRUIT.The instructions on how to have a bowel movement that someone mentioned is there. But it's as clear as mud, and the style is as crappy as the rest of the book. Something about spreading fingers, for instance. And what does ""pressing down with the abdominal muscles"" mean."
3,"Good, common-sense information.","This book holds good, common-sense advice that seems sound and clear. If you do not know a lot about diverticulitis, this is a good book with which to begin. It does hold a small amount of unique advice that is not usually found in other books or articles on the subject.If you are more advanced in your knowledge of the disease, browsing through it would be beneficial, but owning it might be a waste of bookshelf space."
1,Strawberry Shortcake Strawberryland Games,DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!It is no fun and I wish I would have never bought it. Can we get our money back???
4,great for new gamers,Purchased for my 6 y.o. daughter as one of her first DS games. Great for her age and limited gaming experience.
3,"OK, but a little difficult for young kids","We bought this for our 5 year old daughter. She likes it OK, but there is a lot of dialogue to read through before any games can be played. We did have to sit with her the first several times to help her, but she has gotten the hang of it and can play most of the games by herself. That being said, she much prefers the New Super Mario Bros, and another Mario game, Princess Peach. These are much easier to play, and she just likes them better!"
1,Save your money and don't buy this game,"I bought this game for my 5 year old who can play Mario games and the Carnival game with ease. This game is so difficult for her that she can't make it past one level. She brings the game to me and even I can't get the gyst of throwing the bubbles to jump on them. It takes a lot of skill to get this down and it is a core component of being able to master the game. I assumed that Strawberry Shortcake would be for young kids but was sadly mistaken. I think this game misses the mark in all categories. Young kids can't master the technique of the game and older kids will find the concept babyish. A game that you can't progress in, is not a fun game to play.My daughter loves all the Mario games and loves the Carnival Games. Strawberry Shortcake will go in the trash."
2,not a favorite,"My 5 yr old loves Strawberry Shortcake so I thought she would love this game. It is probably one of her least favorite (she prefers nintendogs, cooking mama, smart girls and fashion designer) It has alot of reading and is not simple for her to play without my assistance.Unless you want to constantly read to them, don't buy it."
4,thank you,very fun and entertaining. reminds me of my childhood and the box even smells like strawberries
3,good book,Are you all idiots? The title says WORKBOOK. What makes you think that it would be more than that!!!?
1,This &#65533;book&#65533; is totally useless!,"I was really disappointed when I open the package and saw this book, from the Gardner's Series. It definitely doesn't worth a penny. From the 100 pages, 80 is just a bunch of paper for you to draw! Besides, the storyboards examples have no explanations about how they were planned. This ""book"" is totally useless."
3,Need to do better,"This video is not a great Power Rangers video, but I'm sure if you're a collector you'll be getting it anyway. It's not as if this is seriously dire, but once you put it in the VCR, you probably won't wanna put it in many times after that, so here's hoping you like the video packaging. You'll probably not be noticing it on your shelf for a long time to come."
2,Breaks,"I can't use this product much because it keeps breaking! And we never had that problem with any other condom. And we used a lot of lube with it, too. (We have to use special lube since I'm allergic to glycerin.) It also felt very thick and was a real barrier to happiness in the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This product is not what it looks like and it does not fit my 40 gallon breeder like it should. The way to make it fit is to flip it so the openings are facing like west and east not both south like it should. Dont buy unless you know this product.
1,Wish it looked like they show it.,"The picture shows a complete 36 x 18, however guess what, it comes in two separate pieces. Not at all what I was looking for. Plus the plastic piece that bends is broken on the ends. It really looks unprofessional. It does say at the very end of the description that it comes in two pieces, but then why put that picture up. Why show a complete piece and then tell you its in two pieces. I really am very disappointed in this and really hope you guys fix the problem."
4,Not for the Faint of Heart,"If you believe in political correctness or that the world should be full of gumdrops, roses and big hugs, this book is definitely not for you. If, however, you are looking for a raucous romp that will at times make you laugh out loud and at other times cringe, you should check it out. I found this book to be a quick and easy read (you could probably read the whole thing on a three hour flight) that brought back some memories from my college days. While the characters may not be the most likable people, if you did any partying while you were in college you will be able to relate to them. In sum, the book is a little rough around the edges and will make you squirm at times, but overall it is a light, fun and enjoyable read."
3,portable strobe light,Decent for the price. Not that bright during the day but its good at night. Magnet holds pretty good to the roof of the car.
1,Useless in daylight,"This item might be okay for night use, but during daylight hours it isn't bright enough for any type of practical use."
5,Strobe light,"excellent product. this product on inspection I thought would not meet the standard that I was looking for, but after fitting this product and trying it I was much surprised. this product work just as good as a $100 strobe light which is how much I paid for the last light which only lasted 12 months."
1,Junk,"Bought this for my ATV, under the new law, have to have one. Used it once, and not it does not work at all. Total waste of money."
5,Incredible and Moving!,"THe 9th volume in this incredible series of The Work and the Glory shows the reader how joyfully the Saints met together finally in the Salt Lake Valley. The terrible tale of treachery by the Missourians is still fresh in minds of readers everywhere, and sympathy and love for those who have suffered grows in your heart. THrought the Mormon Battalion, the Sutters Fort, and Winter Quarters, the Steed Family finally comes together and makes it known to the world, the power of the Lord and his hand in all things. Read the series, I promise you will NEVER forget it."
4,Best Cases Available,"You get THREE 3-game holders in the pack, not just one. These are the best cases I have ever gotten for my GBA games. The hinges have not worn out, and I open and close them hundreds of times. I have gotten a lot of different game cases over the years and nothing beats these where you can keep track of 3 games at a time, and it even helps to organize types of games as well. Totally worth it 3 cases for $5"
5,The best case for your GBA catridges,"Not much to it. Place three of your GBA games in the case & you are good to go. Real sturdy quality plastic & is officially licensed by Nintendo. The only drawback is since these cases are no longer in production, sellers are really gouging the hell out of us for them used & new."
5,solid .. worth watching,interesting to see Justin long and joah Hill just before they were real famousit is a good film
4,this is a funny funny movie,"If you know where Trona is, if you know where Ridgecrest is, if you know what the people are like there- this is a funny funny movie. Cute sweet story about a good guy (nice eye candy) and how he is pushed to stand up for himself and his love. Seriously, take it in the context it is filmed- where it is filmed and you'll be rolling."
3,Hometown,"A goofy movie about my hometown. While the landscape is fairly accurate from an outsiders point of view, there is more to Trona than the movie portrays. After all, who else can claim a dirt football field and golf course. And it was a great place to grow up in the 50's and 60's."
5,"Wichita, Kansas has done it again!!","Wichita, Kansas has produced another group of artists. Bringing an original sound, Room Full of Walters has hit the music scene with a hard hitting CD. With Christian lyrics and real life topics, this album touches you where you are and makes to rock along the way. Keep it comin' guys.Chipp"
4,Big,After getting this watch I was very surprised at the size of the watch itself. As a normal size male I could not have worn this watch comfortably. I liked the watch except for the massive size.I would not recommend it for normal statured men.
3,Nice and Big....Especially BIG,"This watch has a very nice, expensive look about it, and is even better looking when you see it than it looks on the pictures on Amazon, but it is huge. I like a large watch, and usually wear a submariner, but this watch is way, way bigger. I returned it because of the size."
1,"Cheesy, weak, and incomplete","I bought this CD for accompaniment music to be used when my son sings at a wedding. Unlike most accompaniment tapes that can be played to back up songs, this music has NO WORDS (lyrics) printed anywhere so you don't know where you are with the tunes - you have to buy another CD that has them included! (You have to buy TWO CDs to know where the words and phrases are.) Also, there isn't a choice of high, medium, or low voice accompaniment (though there is a lot of space on the CD) and the tunes sound pretty synthetic/pathetic.It was MY fault for buying this CD and trusting that it was like the very satisfactory tapes we buy.If you want schmaltz background - go buy muzak. I'm giving this CD to a senior's home...maybe they can stomach it."
3,nice if you just want music for the background of a receptio,This is a nice cd for music only..no words. It makes a nice background for a romantic reception.
3,Can get for Free on her website,I bought this then a few days later found out you can download for FREE on her website. I wish I would have looked a little earlier before I purchased it. It is really good content and even better for free.
4,So far so good...,"I replaced my stock air filter with this item. I had a 3 cylinder Geo Metro previously and a K&N; filter worked wonders for me in that vehicle. In the Geo it helped acceleration and gas MPG.Call it mental or a hoax..but I did not change anything else.I put this one in my tC and I immediately noticed a difference. It seemed to stop a little stuttering on acceleration that I had. It could not have been a dirty filter as I just hit 15,000 miles. I could have had a bad filter...Call it a fluke..but so far both times I have used K&N; air filters they have worked wonders.The only reason it got 4 stars is because I have not tested it for long term use yet on this vehicle. Also..the filter is not marked so you can tell which side is up or which side is down."
4,"K&N quality, great filter - but just a filter!","My 2005 scion TC is the third vehicle in which with a K&N; filter was installed.As other reviewers mentioned above, this is a good filter with somewhat less restricted design for improved airflow. It's most important feature is that you can clean and maintain it as often as you want without having to replace it.You simply cannot expect a high performance gain from a filter installed in the stock filter box, in a stock, low-rev engine. Yes, it sounds better at high rev and maybe adds a couple of HP, but that's not really noticeable in an engine with 160HP to boot with. Even a CAI would not benefit that engine that much - not without a proper ECU remap. With that combo you might be flirting with 2 digit gains (like 10% best, with a good mileage penalty tho).So buy with confidence that this filter is not magic...4x stars exactly cause they exaggerate a bit in their site about performance gains..."
4,not needed unless your engine is upgraded,I does not do anything special for a standerd engine. end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end end
2,Well...........................not worth the worry.,"I bought this watch in early December of 2005. I got it, took the links out, and it worked fine. For about 3 weeks, anyway. While wearing the watch, after winding it earlier that morning, the watch died on me. I had the receipt and shipped it back. I waited for amazon to receive it for almost a month. I am really disappointed with the way amazon handled this. I still have not received a refund or replacement. If you're wanting a reliable watch, this may not be for you. It's a gorgeous watch, however. I just thought it would be more reliable."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I saw two of these plates in my local sporting goods store but needed 8 of them for my family to take camping, so I ordered from Amazon. They looked to be of great quality on the store shelf. I had to grab the still unopened box and pack it in the car on our way out the door, and I was floored when I finally opened it. More than half the plates had chips in them, both on the rims and the eating surfaces. Many also had bubbles where the enamel didn't take, and one had a rust spot already! I had no choice but to use them since it's all we had with us, but this is not the quality I would expect from either Coleman or Amazon!"
3,Running On Fumes,"After unleashing the phenomonal 'Dream On' and 'Guardian Of The Light' albums down in 1982 and 1983 George Duke seems to haverun out of steam.Alot of the songs (noteably the title song and""Got To Get Back To Love"") sound too much like the songs hewas producing for artists like Phillip Baily,Jeffry Osborne andDenise Williams.It's not helped that overwrung pop ballads such as ""Stay Awile"" and ""She Can't Wait Forever"" sound unoriginal anda little stagnant.Things get a little buisier later with thequirky ""Take It All"",the playful ""Ipenema Lady"" and the scorchingfunk-rocker ""Better Ways""-easily the best song on the album.Thisis Duke's final album for Epic records from 1984 and remains onmy very small list of minor George Duke albums.So this ispretty much for either fans of Duke's mid 80's pop productionsor for completists-'Rendevous'is not exactly essencial."
3,RENDEZVOUZ - George Duke,"This ""CAT"" never lets ya' down ! More ""COOL"" 'n' Groovy"" sounds from ""Mr. Duke"" !"
3,How to Make a Million Dollars with Your Book Sales...,"This book is padded with a lot of anecdotes--including a liberal amount of name-dropping--from Gary Owens' career. (And it's only a little over 200 pages at that.) If you look forward to reading some of his reminiscences (which admittedly can be amusing at times), then you might enjoy this book. But if you are hoping for much in-depth discussion or expert advice about the voiceover business, it's best to look elsewhere.It's a shame, really--with Owens' experience and long career, he should have been able to produce a much better ""how to"" manual than this collection of self-indulgent musings. Although, it seems by his own narrative he came by most of his jobs through serendipity or knowing other people in show business, so maybe he just didn't have that much practical advice to impart to modern voice acting students. Anyway, he should have written a much different book, or at least given this one a title more indicative of the actual contents."
1,Gary Talks About Gary,"Sorry Gary but this is not what I wanted. A ""how-to"" book it's not. This book skims over the industry and is mostly all ""Gary"" and his wonderful past. Okay, I concede, he's had a excellent career and I'd enjoy reading his bio but I did not intend to get it out of this book! I think Gary owes me a free VO session!"
1,"THATS QUITE A CLAIM, TO WIN EVERYTIME.........","I READ THIS BOOK. I WAS DISAPPOINTED. FIRST OF ALL IT IS POORLY WRITTEN AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PROOFREAD. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 INDICATES A 90% ADVANTAGE OVER THE AVERAGE PLAYER. WHEN YOU TURN TO CHAPTER 1, THE TITLE THEN SAYS YOU HAVE A 98% ADVANTAGE? WHICH IS IT? THE AUTHOR OFFERS NO INFORMATION AS TO HOW HE DEVELOPED HIS PLAY, NO PROOF OF WINNING PLAY AND NO MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION FOR WHAT HE CLAIMS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. A DANGEROUS WAY TO LOSE MONEY."
4,A Great Romance,"I read this book about 60 years ago, as a teen-ager. The Shuttle It took me about three tries, from about 12 to 15, but once I got past the boring first chapter I found it to be a deeply moving romance. The characters are typical of Frances Burnett, some truly excellent, others dreadful. But I wish I still had it and would read it again."
4,historical stuff,"Having just read ""The American Heiress,"" I was eager to know more about the practice of impoverished English ""royalty"" trading their title for wealth with an American bride. Despite the fact it seemed to be written before paragraphs were invented, I really enjoyed reading it. Some might find it predictable and cloying, but perhaps that's what I was in the mood for."
3,The Shuttle,"A period novel that describes characters and surroundings so that you feel you are there. However, I found the story line to drag and was repetitive. I found myself skipping a lot of pages to get to the continuing story of the main characters."
4,Dark but Absorbing,"This book set a slow pace to start. When the various facets of the story come together it creates a dark jewel of a read. The herione ultimately sets right the wrongs and finds her own true love. The story is well told although largely depressive with brief glimmers of light. Written in a different era, this might be a good school literature assignment."
4,Excellent for board review and general review for practitioners,"This is an excellent case-based approach to reviewing pediatric radiology. Organized by the major subspecialties, each section has numerous cases to solidify your knowledge base. The usefulness, in my time, was taking the cases as unknowns by looking at the history and reviewing the images. A diagnosis and discussion is covered on the following page which is great for self assessment.Inserts including Pearls and Pitfalls emphasizes key points for each subject. The images are decent and diagnostic quality but have been surpassed by current technology.This is a solid book, even if the images need an update.It is an excellent book for rotations in Pediatric Radiology for both Radiology Residents/Fellows and Pediatric Residents/Fellows, alike.I highly recommend this text."
3,Classic cases but poor image quality by today's standards.,Classic cases for orals studying but it was written a long time ago and the image quality is poor by today's standards. I really enjoyed it and wish they would do another edition.
5,Gotta love Psalty!,"Psalty was a favorite of mine as a kid and I bought this for my kids. Some new songs, and some old favorites. Ernie is a great songwriter and this is a perfect video for preschoolers!"
4,Nothing worse than a hood dropping on your head!,"After a support arm has been in a car for 15 years, you never know what will happen. When the weather was hot, the old ones worked, but when it cooled down they were worthless. I bought both supports. They came fast, easy transaction, we're exactly what they said they were. It took a little bit of extra effort to install, but that was the design of the car. They work very well and I would recommend them."
5,Does not fit 2007 Acura TL,"The K&N; filter is great, but Amazon says that this is the correct filter for a 2007 Acura TL. It is not. The stock filter has a notch out of one of the corners, whereas this filter is rectangular without the notch. I'm not sure of the correct part number for the TL, but this definitely is not it.The K&N; website says the correct part number is 33-2379. If you have a TL, that's what you need."
1,Zero Stars,"Simplistic, poorly written and a complete waste of time. I wish chiropractic were the cure-all for PDD, but it isn't."
1,Save Your Money,"Don't be mislead by the title. I was looking for good information on PDD-NOS and this book was a ""let-down""."
1,A big disappointment,"About 12 hours after inserting batteries, the clock started losing time. Replaced batteries and problem continued before clock stopped working altogether. A big disappointment."
1,Backwards wall clock,Minute hand was loose so the clock does not work. Tried to fix with no luck. So it's decor on my daughters wall instead of a functioning clock decor.
4,Never Late Again!,"As an insomniac, I have a problem with ""time"". Since I bought this product, I have never been late to an appointment again!"
2,Ok but not for me,"I loved the art and rhymes in the book. However, there was a lot of fill in the blank spots for your baby's first few years. I prefer to jot my own thoughts instead of someone elses. There is not much place for pictures or extra writing either. I wish it had at least one pocket for storage of keepsakes. I will look for something that meets my needs."
3,Nice but could be better,"I bought this book two years ago when I was expecting my daughter. I chose it because it received stellar reviews from other parents. I love the old-fashioned look, and the poems and illustrations are tasteful and beautiful. Now that my daughter's almost two, I've had plenty of occasions to write in her baby book and have found it somewhat disappointing. There are plenty of opportunities to list baby's particulars but no room to go into any detail. There have been some very touching, funny, and embarrassing moments in our daughter's life that I'd like for her to read about someday. I've also found it lacking in spaces for photographs. I made a separate scrapbook of her first year, but would've liked to have photo documentation of her growth in her baby book as well. We're now expecting her baby brother or sister, and I'll be looking for a different baby book this time."
3,Too old-fashioned for my tastes,"The book is beautiful, it's just not my tastes. I knew this might be an issue going in, which is why I also ordered Baby's Book: The First Five Years which is more contemporary.The nursery rhymes throughout are neat, but in my opinion, it's a waste of space. If I was actually going to use this book, I would cover them up with photos or keepsakes.There are also some pages I would never complete, like the immunizations and child illnesses page. Also, an entire page devoted to possible boy and girl names is overkill (especially for us since we only had one name picked out for each sex). Oh, and the visitors' wishes for the baby... if you get this after the fact, you would either handwrite (copy) thoughts from cards or paste actual cards there.This will be going in a gift basket for another new mom..."
4,"Nice, simple, not too ambitious","I got this for my second child, a boy. I spent a while looking for a baby book that was simple enough that I could keep up without too much effort. Sure, it would be nice if there were a little more blank space for photos, or a pocket for a few keepsakes. But I'm OK with that.The best part about this book is how understated it is. The first 100 or so baby books I picked were too twee for my taste--pink! and blue! and bunnies! and puppy dogs!.... The graphics and poetry in this book are very classic.As another reviewer so aptly said, you scrapbookers out there will find this book very limiting--but it's good for the rest of us!"
3,"Nice, but not as functional as I expected","After reading the great reviews, I decided to purchase this record book for my 3rd child, a girl. I was disappointed when I received it for a few reasons. For one, the packaging was terrible and it is really rainy right now. The book got damp and all of the pages are ""wavy"" now. Secondly, the pages are all shiny, so when you try and write with a pen, you have to let it dry forever before you can close the book or it transfers to the other pages. Not conducive to writing information at all when you have to let each page dry before you can go on to the next. Thirdly, there are absolutely no pockets to put in locks of hair, the hospital bracelets or other memorabilia that you cant just glue to a page. Oh, and there is no space anyplace for footprints - and even if there were, the page material is slippery. The basics of the book are nice, the details are cute but not over the top - but this just isnt what I had in mind for quality."
5,Love it!,"I have a desktop full of Allsop products, very stylish with the Mac. The prior reviewer must have received a defective unit. I never had a problem with the colour."
2,"Functional, but an aesthetically goofy color...","First, this stand does pretty much what the description says, however, the unit is an olive green powder-coat, rather than the silvery color on the picture presented by the seller. I would also steer buyers away if they plan on putting anything heavier than 25 pounds on it. The unit bounces and wiggles with my 22 Lb. iMac, which is a little annoying for the :30 seconds or so it takes to steady itself (unplugging a USB drive). I am supposing that there may be an issue with this unit, perhaps it's just the primer coat? I'd find it hard to believe that people are looking for a greenish-gray item, and I will contact the seller to verify this. If you own a Mac, a white, or a metal colored item, it's not going to look matched as it would if it looked like the picture. Jim"
4,Works for my 23 inch Monitor!,"This definitely works for what it is intended to do, and that is to support a monitor. Currently I have my 23 inch monitor set on top of it and have not had any issues with it at all. I'll agree with most reviewers here that the color is not a match to the one on the picture, honestly am okay with it. I also have a keyboard underneath that rests on the small shelf and it does ease my eyes of the would be clutter had I not bought this.The only reason as to why I don't rate it a 5 star is due to the color not matching the advertised photo.Am very satisfied with my purchase! :)"
4,A Life of Prophet Mohammed,"One of the best books about Prophet Mohammed (PBH), his life and religion of God. Author provides first a good history of Arabia prior to birth of Prophet where you get a good understanding of the environment, there are a lot of references to old greek, persian and Byzantium historians. Than mostly relying on Ibn Ishak's ""Life of Mohammed"" the birth and life of Mohammed is written. There are few references to Hadiths that may not necessarily be sahih or reliable but considering that they are muslim sources, author seems to take them as they are. I found this book written very nicely, all key events are described with quotations from the original sources and time to time author makes interpretations or value judgments. I found the ancient history of arabia very useful, provides you perspective and who is who type of information."
1,not the real deal,"I was super excited to see that Haitian coffee was available for sale. Having Haitian parents, I grew up on Haitian coffee and it is hard to get in the States. Unfortunately when I did get it, it was not the real thing. Better off buy coffee from the supermarket. Real bummer."
5,Perfect potful of coffee,"I enjoy this coffee more than any other.Haitian Bleu Coffee, Ground (Case of Four 12 ounce Valve Bags)Haitian Bleu Coffee, Whole Bean (Case of Four 12 ounce Valve Bags)"
1,a waste of paper and time,"I cannot think of one good thing to say about this book. Every character was an idiot or a jerk or both. The couple do horrible things to each other (he nearly assualts her, she leaves him in the desert to die) There is no reason whatsoever for them to like each other or for anyone reading the book to like them. This is not my idea of a romance. It is also very badly written and melodramtic."
3,Good Game....,"Great to have help on some of the more difficult missions. One of the first games released for the 360, a first person shooter with unique Weapons..."
1,Don't plan to win the game with this book.,The worse book ever as far as a guide book goes. But what can you expect from prima? They should not be in busines. Don't buy it. You will waste your money.
5,Wonderful book; hard to put down,This book is a wonderful book that depicts problems people face in society and how they can often solve problems by putting their problems in God's hands. It was a book that was hard to put down. I hope the autors write more books for I would buy them. I wish they had books that depicted young widows lives and how we have to face our everyday problems also. I look forward to future books that the authors choose to write.
2,Not touching at all,"I read this book for a church book club and was terribly disappointed. I wanted to get involved with these characters, but they were so thinly written. Cathy was my favorite character, but as soon as I got involved in her story, it jumped to another story. I just didn't feel that any one story was well developed. A very unsatisfying read."
5,Excellent,What can you say about two dynamite authors. I always enoy their books and when they write together - what can you say. They know how to tell a good story that will keep you reading and reading and wanating more..
1,seasons under heaven,"This was the first book I read that co-authored Blackstock and LaHaye. I can't wait to order all of the other ""Seasons"" books. The trials and sacrifices these families go through are so heart-renching. Again, I was drawn to study my Bible as I read along. These books make you want to be a better person. Thank you for writing them!!!"
4,Not for the weak at heart,"At first listen, this album is just a long boring very forgetful album. The songs are depressing and confusing, leaving one with a since of hopelessness that only Waters himself could inflict. After listing to album for the sixth, seventh and eighth time, one finnaly starts to apretiate the beauty of his work. Roger takes your mind and soul through a nighmarish ride one doesn't soon forget. This is album, like all Waters solo stuf, is meant to be listen to in its intirety, alone in a dim lit room with your headphones at full blast. If you like a good mind trip, and don't mind fealing a bit somber at the end of the ride, than this one is for you. Sit back close your eyes and enjoy the ride ..."
4,"Good, but not great","This is probably Waters' best solo album. Great music with Clapton on guitars but I have a real problem with the mix. The thing that makes Roger Waters great is his lyrics, which are very difficult to hear through most of the album. Not sure if he intended this or not, but it is very annoying. Crank up the volume to hear Roger, then get blasted out by the music.His later work is better in terms of being able to hear the lyrics, but the music isn't up to the quality of this album. Nevertheless, this is probably a must have for Roger Waters fans and likely for Pink Floyd fans in general."
3,takes a few listens to get into.,"Roger's first solo album since leaving Pink Floyd didn't quite grab me at first few listens, and I originally dismissed it as pessimistic Waters sludge. There were simply too many lyrics to digest and not a lot of memorable stand ouot moments. Upon further investigation, though, I realize this is actually quite a fine album- a classic Waters concept album following in the musical direction of the Wall and the Final Cut. I consider Pros & Cons part of a Waters concept Trilogy which started with the Wall and Final Cut, though Pros & Cons wasn't as interesting or sucessful musically or conceptually as the previous two concepts. It still is a decent listen though. There is enough Waters emotion and personal angst in here to sastisfy anyone really into the Wall and Cut, though a little harder to digest at first listen. Try listening to this alone."
3,My mind and Roger's,"The Pro's and Con's of Hithchiking is more than an album. When you sit down to listen to it, you become curious of what the album is really about, and why. True music makes you feel something and even better music takes you there, which PACOH does. Roger Waters uses Eric Clapton on guitar throughout the album and he is complimented by a number of other excellent musicians in general. This album showed me how much Roger Water's ideas contributed to the music of Pink Floyd: musically and lyrically. The music and words connect from beginning to end in this album, creating (in my mind) a vivid picture of life as a hitchiker. You can feel an almost lost man searching for something through the musical chords and timely lyrics that the Pros and Cons contain. This is a great record for all true Floydians fans and those who see Roger as ""the man behind script""."
1,3-In-One Review,"A REVIEW OF:THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCHHIKINGRADIO K.A.O.S.AMUSED TO DEATHby Roger WatersThese three solo albums are important simply because they are the first, second, and third worst albums ever recorded. It doesn't matter what order, they are all interchangable. Roger Waters has shown us what horrible, unlistenable, pretentious garbage this medium called ""music"" can be turned into. Truly, these are landmark recordings."
5,Let's Rewind,"and take this recording as a Clapton ( This record brought him back from almost disapearing ) Waters Colaboration of Historic Proportions , definetly a turning point in both's lifes as musicians with weight in the Pop world we live in . Defining turning points . If you have not listened to it and like and love Clapton , is a must ... and if U like Waters is another must . It's hard to Love Waters but He tought me not to think of Us and Them , but of Us , all of Us are definetly The Same Animals ... Long Live Good Music ... Pkx oo4"
2,Very dull...,"Warning: this album has little or no melody! The only good song is ""Every strangers eyes"", and Rogers voice is totally neurotic throughout. Songs such as ""Sexual revolution"" and ""The pros and cons of hitchhiking"" are no classics - they're just below par rock filler. ""Go fishing"" is ok, but thats generous! I don't want to slag off an album by one of my favourite artists but I can't listen to this record. Thats why I can't understand all these 5 star reviews. The first 4 tracks on this album are totally unmemorable, and the overall 'feel' of the record seems creepy and cold. Roger failed at his first attempt at going solo; ""Radio Kaos"" and ""Amused to Death"" are great though."
