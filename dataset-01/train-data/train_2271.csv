1,Minimalism at its worst,"The too-cool for emotion, post-irony world as depicted here is bereft of insight or even thought. I expected fin de siecle engagement and found 1990s ennui."
2,A Mildly Interesting First Attempt,"In an attempt to mimic styles similar to that of Nick Hornsby and Alain de Botton, Geoff Dyer attempts to capture the essence of love, sex, and friendship during the twenty-something stage of life. While Dyer has moments where he eloquently describes the agony of trying to make time stand still, these moments are few in the realm of a 300 page book. His characters Luke, Alex, Nicole, and Sahra are unique, but underdeveloped. The reader gets this vision of these four as nothing more than lost souls seeking another acid trip when there is so much more in their persona that could be explored. Overall ""Paris Trance"" is an interesting first attempt at a novella, yet perhaps with his next work, Dyer will explore his talent and show to his reader what he is ""really"" capable of."
2,two couples and their struggle for love,"Disappointing as a whole but with wonderful moments. The beauty of it is in perfectly captured events, like Christmas in the country, but the core doesn't hold. I loved ""Out of Sheer Rage"" by the same author, but was disappointed here."
1,caught in class,"This is an ~incredibly~ formulaic class narrative of the sort only young British writers still manage to foist on the anglophone public. It is intensely self involved, and yet after almost 300 pages of omphalic overregard, we find that the characters over whom we are to swoon (for their slack, their ennui, their ability to refer to the tired staples of reference wit) are shallow children, inspiring neither charm, nor solicitious mopruffling, nor envy, nor cautious comparison, nor any reaction other than one of relief for having reached the endpapers. Martin Amis (or Kingsley for that matter), what has become of young Britain?"
4,excellent ratchet,This is a replacement for a similar S-K ratchet that I've had for 35 years. S-K is a quality maker of fine hand tools and this one is no exception. I'm very pleased with it and am hopeful that it lasts as long as the first one.
2,A Poor Finale,"For a series that started off so promisingly back in May of 1997, ""Twilight of the Gods"" is a disappointing finish to the adventures of Bernice Summerfield.The prose varies from dull to duller, with far too many instances of cringeworthy dialogue. The plot arc, which began in ""Where Angels Fear,"" finally grinds to a disappointing conclusion, with villains pulled out of a plot hole, and the same old schtick of ""beings from a previous universe gain powers beyond mortal ken in our universe.""All in all, a most disappointing read, with none of the wit, creativity, or humour that used to be so characteristic of Bernice Summerfield's adventures."
3,"Great concept, disappointing execution","I've always wanted to take a tour of the important places in Vincent Van Gogh's life and write a book about it. This book does that to some degree...it is written as a biography that highlights the locations where Van Gogh lived and worked and includes a short travel guide in the back. I would have preferred a travel guide/essay that focuses more on the places. For example, there's no map in this book! To me, that is a major oversight. The writing is not spectacular, and there are better biographies of Van Gogh out there, not to mention his letters. Still, I like the idea, and there are some nice photos and a few suggestions of places to go. I would have preferred a different structure to the book, with the travel information integrated into the book, and more emphasis on descriptions of specific places."
2,About the same as the 4th edition,"I had the 4th edition and expected to find a lot of new jokes in the 1st edition. However,the jokes are almost all the same."
3,pretty good,"There are some great jokes in here, along with the pretty good ones, and overall I did enjoy reading the book. However it is also easy enough to pick up great jokes on the web, or by listening to the Prairie Home Companion. Admittedly, for people like myself who don't always remember jokes so well, it is often useful to have a hard-copy in the form of a joke book such as this, and I recommend it in that capacity. As an alternative though, I would consider simply donating the money that would've been spent on this book to NPR and picking up similar material by listening to Keillor's show."
4,Title says it all - Pretty Good,"Pleasant listneing to hear lots of old standards, and many I had forgotten. A good giggle while I'm working in the kitchen."
4,Not quite what I was looking for!,I was expecting the same John Starnes that I saw on the Jimmy Swaggart Crusades.This was a slight dissapointment.Maybe seeing him sing is better than just hearing him???
1,not a good poker book,"If you are looking for a good poker strategy book, look elsewhere. I found this book unfocused and full of ""filler"" material. It gives advice on several poker variants (Holdem, Omaha, Seven Card Stud), but offers nothing ground-breaking or in-depth on any. Most disappointing is the extra material thrown in to ""fill out"" the book. There is a compendium of cyber terms, explanations on how to use Party Poker and Poker Stars, instructions on how to fund your account, etc. If you are looking for a good poker strategy book focusing specifically on Holdem, I recommend ""Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments Vol 1"". I don't believe this book is worth the money for the majority of players."
1,Orrible,"Esta mujer no tiene nada de talento para cantar. Ella misma dice que si lo tiene, pero no sabe aser ninguna cosa con su voz. Esta tratando de ser como otras cantantes. No gastes tu dinero."
5,Full of photos and details,"This book is for the Civil War buff who needs to look up anything related to weapons and ammunition. You can learn alot from even browsing through the book. Good photos, interesting descriptions and well organized. Nice gift for someone you know."
3,"Adequate Product, But Original Formula is Superior","I have used this andNature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover, 32-Ounce- the original formula is far superior to this formula in over-all effectiveness and price."
5,Orange Oxy Stain Stuff - WORKS GREAT!!!,"I do animal rescue and a friend recommended this to me a few years ago. This solution really works, totally and completely removing the ordor, and there is no residual. Does pretty good on the stains too, if they aren't too old when you get to them. I had to buy more, it's the best I've found so far. I highly recommend using this for all your pet (no matter what kind) urine or stain needs. Awesome!"
5,Great for Puppy Accidents,"I have a 10 month old puppy and yes, she now and then makes a mistake.But, this product takes care of any stain, odor on the carpet. I am very happypuppy owner . The product does as it says it does if you follow their instructions.Amazon, as always, gives super service."
1,Total junk. Broke after 2 hours.,Total junk. I ordered one in red and one in blue and both broke within 2 hours after putting the battery in. Not 2 hours of use. In one the light stopped working and in the other the motor stopped spinning. These are not worth the money. Its just a plastic piece of junk. Very disappointing to my children who wanted to make their room look like a police station.
1,Cheap and dim.,I expected cheap materials and low manufacturing quality I was however hoping that the light would actually be visible. The plastic of the dome is so thick and the color so saturate that you can barely see the light in a darkened room. Not worth the effort.
4,"overall, pretty good","Pretty decent game. People are still playing it online.It's a little hard to explain this properly but ... while the graphics are a little crude by 360 standards, they are still quite good. The art design and lighting are so effective that the slightly lower resolution graphics work well.The frame rate stutters occasionally, but it doesn't affect the game play. You'll see the frame rate slow down but it doesn't make you miss a shot.Achievement-wise, you'll have to play through at least 4 times as some of the achievements are mutually exclusive."
5,Awesome Game,Incredible AI great single person shooter with a good story. Warning Horror storyline / gory.
3,Kind a scary but...,"I you are looking for a game to scare the crap out of you, don;t buy this game. If you are looking for one that is unsettling and nervous, this is the game for you. Th actual gameplay is slow in my opinion. You have to walk around alot in order to find action. And when there is some, there are only few guys there to pop. By all means though, rent before buying this one yall.The graphics are alright. Weaopns and people are good, but how the people move isn't.I you are scared about the little girl, don't be. She aint that scary. The parts she comes are just very unsettling.The game is very repetitive. There are the same environments over and over and nothing s new when it comes to the maps. And the whole shadow on the wall thing gets boring.Overall, this game fun, but slow."
4,Solid Shooter!,"I love the SLOW-MO option ,simular to matrix & maxx payne. The detailed enemy bodies flow nicely through the air and the bullet trails look quite kool. But they couldve added more detail levels. While some of the walls have some texture. Most of it is kinda plain grey 'blockey' type level design. This game didnt do much for me in the scare department. I never really felt scared or tense at all. Actually after playing such a detailed game like GEARS Of War. F.E.A.R is very very Bland in level detail and design. I fely myself getting bored waiting for another firefight. Actually the long walk to another firefight is simply the game loading another level. BUT I must say the FPS still is fun. The true gem of this game is the Slow-Mo effect .All in ALL a good shooter for the FPS fan. And the little girl 'fire walk' scenes look great."
3,couldn't get into it...,"let me first say i made a big mistake. i played rainbow six vegas before i started playing this one, which made this game unplayable since rainbow six is the best console shooter of this generation and everything else pales in comparison. trust me. try RSV if you don't believe me. it'll cure you.another that turned me off is the bullet time. i thought that was ok the first max payne, but i don't want to see it again. it's played out."
3,Don't Forget To Check That Answering Machine!,"I really wanted to love this game. There is nothing wrong with the visuals or the gameplay. The bullet time was awesome(first time in a first person shooter?), and when the action happened, it was a great gaming experience. It's just that there seems so little of it. The hallucination stuff was very cool, and the game started off with a bang. But the further I went along(after cruising the endless parade of office hallways and checking countless answering machines and computers), I just got bored. I can think of a dozen first person shooters that are better than this...maybe two dozen. Sure, it looks 'prettier' than some, and it does pick up some near the end, but by that time it was too little too late."
3,Scarey fun,"A friend bought this for me. I am not really into horror movies and what not, and I found this game pretty creepy. Good game play, but too creepy for me. Similar to Bio-Shock which I liked better."
5,Super Special Awesome Review,"I bought this game for my boyfriend because he was playing the Fear Files; we had no idea what the game as about and we kinda played the files blindly, having no idea what the plotline was. Plus, he needed a new game so I thought it'd be nice to get it for him. I came onto Amazon hoping to find the game cheaper than their original price; I did find one used and it was claimed to be just like new. I took the risk and now weeks later, my boyfriend is still enjoying the game. Thanks so much for the product!"
3,Great...For the Last Generation Consoles,"If this game had come out for the PS2 or Xbox, I would have given it five stars. It is everything that was awesome in FPS games a couple of years ago. However, the graphics and gameplay do not live up to the current generation of gaming consoles. It is enjoyable enough for those who really need an FPS fix (I don't know how anyone could need that right now) but I've found that I don't care about the story. I'll pick the game up now and then and continue it, not really caring what I have forgotten about the story. The slow-mo affects are well done, but not unique either. In short, nothing really new, but a decent game if you can pick it up cheap and want some horror-action to distract you for a bit."
2,Nothing new,"This game is not too bad. But for the experienced gamer, this game is pretty linear. In parts I found it did not hold my interest because of the repetitive nature. The environment is dark and gritty throughout that variation seemed to be nonexistant. There were parts in this game that had a ""shock"" value, but not enough for me to say this is one of the best games produced. Rainbow 6, Halo 2 (and soon 3) are games that I would highly recommend in comparison.I would rent it and if you like it - buy it."
4,How dare they?,My nephew wants this game so badly. He said that it is one of the best Xbox 360 games. As a loving uncle for his birthday which is fast approaching I am going to order some games for him. I was going to get him this game right along with second part to this game. I looked at the game and I own an Xbox 360 myself so I know games and for some reason this game is a platinum hit. This means that the game is old and sold so many copies. When this happens Microsoft drops the price to either $19.99 or $29.99. This game is being osld by some other seller for the regualr price of a game. This is sickening. I mean they should not be allowed to do that. Their might be parents who will buy this because they dont know and they are getting ripped off. I hate sellers that do this. I will be getting this game from Gamestop. I will give the game 4 stars cause my nephew said it is a good game and he knows games but for the seller they get zero stars.
2,F.E.A.R. Xbox360 Game,"I purchased this game for my son, he kept it about 2 weeks and we sold it on ebay. His suggestion is to rent it before you buy it. He has purchased a lot of games and this is the first one that he has gotten rid of this quick. He said the graphics were poor, the game was boring and being a PC game first, it was dated. He has played a lot of games on a lot of systems and it was just not his kind of game."
2,"Horrible, just horrible..","I spent $7 on this game and I still feel like it was a huge waste of money..It has to be the worst thing I've played in a while.It's extremely boring, repetitive, slow, and predictable. I bought this because I thought it was going to be scary, hence the name FEAR, but nothing about this game scared me in the LEAST. It has glitches up the butt, from if standing too close to a wall you're able to be shot through it, to the character getting stuck on the smallest of objects like a chair. So insanely disappointed in this.. It's cool sometimes I guess, but it's pretty much all around a bad game.."
3,"Excellent for 2005, but its 2009","I got this game so I could understand whats going on in number 2 when it comes out. It is a great game with some really good gameplay, but overall the graphics and repetiveness of the levels gets old. You can tell its a 4 year old game, but I still loved it, and it has gotten me excited to see what 2 will be like."
4,"Pretty good, but it's no Gears of War.","I think I got totally spoiled by Gears. I played Gears first and then purchased FEAR. I'll admit that FEAR has been a mild let down. I do enjoy most of the game play and the ""bullet time"" is a lot of fun. I really enjoy watching bodies fly apart in slow motion after getting decimated by a shotgun blast. The graphics are better than average but do not compare to Gears. The horror element is a little weak, but some of the atmospherics do give me the creeps. I have jumped a couple of times. However, I think Turok: Dinosaur Hunter on N64 actually scared me more than this game. I don't know if I would recommend the average Joe go out and purchase this game. If you are a shooter nut like me you will probably enjoy it as it does have some novelty. Otherwise, just borrow it from a friend."
3,confused,"Loved the book, for the most part, but confused about the rhyming of 'hawk and cork'. Anyone else find this as well?"
2,Questioning our beliefs,"The first part discussed some of the church's beliefs and traditions and her problems related to them. Each chapter begins with her quoting a writer and then questioning what is said. This, including her initial response, is all in a journal she once kept. The book comments on her initial comments with new insights she has gained over the years. At first I liked the book even though it was quite negative in many cases. AFter a while I decided that even though it provoked questions for me it was becoming so negative that the negativity was rubbing off on me. That, I decided, was not what I needed at this point in my life."
2,Sr. Issues strikes again,"I first encountered ""Sr. Issues"" by way of ""Wisdom Distilled from the Daily,"" a fine read on St. Benedict if you could get past the occasional barbs against the church vis a vie ""womans roles."" With this latest work, Sr. Issues revisits and expands on this and other topics.In short, Traditional Catholics would be well served to ignore Sr. Joan, there are so many fine Catholic authors ones' money and time is too precious to waste on a schismatic. For those who seek ""reform"" in the name of destroying the true faith, ""Kerry"" Catholics, or quasi-Episcopalians, then Sr. Joan is right up your alley."
5,Fascinating true-life story of tolerance and acceptance,"A fascinating true-life story of how a determined troupe of drag performers in a ""model socialist town"" in macho Cuba not only made a name and a business for themselves while operating a nightclub cantina and providing locals with great entertainment, but became accepted as a part of the fabric of daily life in modern Cuba. A compelling insight into a Cuba most Americans don't know exists, with a Spanish music soundtrack to die for."
4,Good book for couples trying to decide whats right for them,I purchased this book when me and my boyfriend were going through a hard time. It was a good product overall and i went on to purchase the complete idiots guide to a healthy relationship. I think this book would be better suited for beggining couples trying to determine if their partner has similar goals in life.
5,A compendium of material from his papers,"His research was excellent. This book is about some of his research.I needed it specifically for examining his transition model theory and this book met and exceeded those requirements. Some of the material and figures are directly from his papers with some slightly different presentations. You might not need this if you alread possess the individual articles.But this is an extremely good book which presents the perspective and insight into the years before JKR, between JKR and DMT and till MD and I am sure the acronyms are self explanatory. On the whole, this is a highly specialized book meant for researchers into phenomena involving elastic contact and friction. It is a part of the trio of K L Johnson's Contact mechanics and Israelachvili's Intermolecular and surfaces forces books."
5,Great little zester,"This zester is very reasonably price and does an outstanding job (from small zesting to large strips). It makes quick work of it and in the end, that's what it is all about!"
5,Mona Lisa,"This is a great how to book. It provides both practical and useful information in how to prepare Leases and Rental Agreements. You will learn how to check references and credit. It shows you how to properly prepare a rental agreement or lease, rental application and other useful forms. This book is a good refence guide to avoid all the legal no-nos. This book will also save you from Attorney fees becase all the information needed to rent or lease property in your state is provided in this book. I highly recommend this book."
4,A smarter way for landlords to draw up their own lease,"As with all Nolo legal guidebooks, Leases & Rental Agreements is very informative. If you're in need of a lease or rental agreement and advice on state rental laws, this product is a smarter way than altering any lease agreement you can find to lease a property without paying a lawyer. Leases and rental agreements are on the CD and the book has many tear out forms to use. Also, included is a reference guide to state laws.It would only be an improved product for the landlord if Nolo combined Leases & Rental Agreements and Every Landlord's Guide to Finding Great Tenants since leasing a property requires both to be successful"
2,Background noise not a pleasure,"I would have liked to give this CD a better rating based on the performance. However, they have added very distracting ""enviromental"" sounds to the tracks that really distract from enjoying the music. Had I been aware that the music contained this awful background noise I would not have purchased."
2,Buch McWuerd,Its pretty sad when most of this guys books are available for a penny and the only positive reviews come from Harriet Klausner!
5,An Excellent Book,"Dr.Kalam has written a very inspiring book. He gives examples of great Indian scientists, right back from Aryabhata to the Nobel Laureate Prof.S.Chandrasekar and motivates young Indians to seek Knowledge to make India the great country she deserves to be.Highly recommended for anyone who has read 'Wings of Fire' or wants to get inspired."
3,Good book and must read for teens of India,"Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power within India examines the reasons and causes for Indians capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What can make the great nations as India to truly prove them selves?This book is great book and President. Kalam is good author but it fails to touch the soul of reader. Many times reader feels that this book is talking for long but that could have been said by using little words and concise phrases. Even though I believe that this is must read book for every Indian school going kids. As said this is truly good book and will fire the minds of the young Indian, who are the future of India."
5,Two of my favorite eps,"I loved Leonard Betts--classic X-File. I gave it five stars. Betts is a person who gets out of many situations by losing an appendage and later growing it back; for example, he pulls off his thumb to escape a pair of handcuffs. And at the beginning, is decapitated by an accident, but walks out of the morgue, a new head growing.Memento Mori *must* be loved by everyone, even the small NoRomo population of the X-Files community. ;) It tells of Scully's fight with cancer, with many moments favored by 'Shippers. Gillian Anderson is great in this episode, one of my favorite. She portrays Scully and all her emotions *exceptionatly* well."
2,FAILING GRADE,"DO NOT get this book if you want to pass the exam. I took the exam and received a 78. I researched the questions that I missed and none of the material was covered in Joseph Byrne's book. Buy the Network+ Study Guide by David Groth since all of the questions that I missed were covered in it. I wasted $40 on Mr. Byrne's book, $140 on the exam, and three months of studying."
3,Good Review; Perhaps Not Enough For Those New To Networks,"This book contains good review material to prepare for the Network+ exam if you have experience. Those new to networking may either need more or different study material to pass due to the fact that this book contains many errors that could cost points on the exam. The accompanying CD also contains errors, some of which are also in the book. The study questions in the book come from the CD (Beachfront Quizzer). Some errors are obviously not just typos, but wrong information. Either the author or publisher dropped the ball when proofing this book. The test I took contained internet material not covered. I passed, only using this book; but I have networking experience and other certifications."
1,This Book's More of a Liability Than An Asset,"I purchased this book as a secondary reference but it contains so many blatant errors that it's become more of a liability than a resource. I've searched for errata online but couldn't find any, suggesting that the publisher isn't willing to offer help to beleaguered users. What's especially disconcerting is that this volume was authored by ""a member of the i-Net+ exam objectives team"" which made it sound like an authoritative resource. Typos are expected in something as dry as an IT resource but explanations that build on obviously incorrect information make you question the author's long list of credentials."
2,A Disappointment,"I was extremely offended by the author's disrespect towards his subject, not to mention bored to tears by his dusty writing-style. This book was written eighty years ago by a man who consistently belittles the spiritual beliefs of all non-christian peoples, and refers to the buddhist, taohist, and hindu cultures as being childish, pathetic, silly and to be pitied and ridiculed on many levels. His attitude towards dragons is nothing if not derisive. Do not be taken in by the book-jacket review and the playful cover. If you want a book tracking the rise of dragon worship throughout the world, but with little to no historical folklore, than this is your book. But if you are looking forward to reading entertaining dragon lore from around the globe, than this is NOT what you are looking for."
4,A Western Perspective,"Full of facts about Dragon Mythology. From early history to the far east and finally a mention of the dragon in medieval times as the legend relates to St. George. The one difficulty I had with the book was a lot of historical information without much background or elaboration. An example of this is as follows... ""The dragon possesses the power of self-transformation, may make itself dark or luminous, or render itself invisible."" Where the reader might hope to learn the lore behind this legend. Overall a good read and solid basis for Dragon history."
3,Better than most movies. Solid thriller.,"A good solid thriller that moves and builds suspense. Worth the price of a paperback, which is about the same as a movie of the same kind of thing. But it becomes predictable at the end and you can see the plot twists coming miles away. But at the same time Abraham's writing is very good and minimal which speeds the plot along. I stayed up late to read it, and I'd buy his next book whenever I'm in the mood for a good suspense thriller. Although, if you liked this book, I highly recommend Peter Staub's `The Throat' as a true contemporary masterpiece of thriller-horror."
2,Glad I borrowed and didn't buy.,"Although the book did manage to keep me interested enough to reach the end, I was disappointed. The plot has many flaws; the characters are stereotypical and therefore predictable, most of them, including the heroine, having the morals of cats. Excuse me, I just insulted my cat."
4,Excellent murder mystery,"When I first began to read this novel, I figured it would be the typical husband-caught-wife-cheating-and-kills-her type of plot, but it was so much more! It had some very nice twists and interesting characters. I would highly recommend it."
5,A sly and suspenseful tour de force,"In ""A Perfect Crime"" Peter Abrahams gives us several well-developed characters, then sets them on a collision course that is as unpredictable as it is inevitable. We know the scenario can only lead to disaster, but what kind? And who will be the ultimate victim(s)? The pace picks up, the complications multiply, and the plot switches gears often enough to keep readers guessing till the end. A really well-written story."
2,"Uneven and, at times, predictable","The first 50 pages of the book had an astounding number of coincides -- enough to make the book completely unbelievable. However, the premise was interesting -- a genius that becomes highly motivated to commit murder, and get away with it. To be fair, the last one-third of the book moved at a good pace and was quite exciting. The two main female characters were very interesting; the mastermide was intriguing; the actual killer was spooky. This could have been a very good thriller, but the first part of the book was not well-crafted."
2,"Poor plotting, coincidences as cheap gimmicks.","An excellent writer wasted his gift on this poorly plotted piece that appears to be a make-it-up-as-you-go effort. Instead of devising a ""perfect crime"" and creating a plot to carry it out, Mr. Abrahams simply allows his ""genius"" villain to bumble along, bouncing from one idea to another, in simple-minded reaction to events. And the author's laziness is manifest in his reliance on so many bizarre coincidences to get characters into and out of situations. Perhaps he's just playing with us, intending the title to be a sarcastic commentary on his villain's ridiculous, inflated ego: That he could think that this is a perfect crime? What a dimwit! Either way, I felt cheated as a reader. Still, his characters are well-drawn and his writing skills obviously superior. A shame to waste so much. It's as if a great Shakespearean troupe were saddled with presenting ""Beavis and Butthead do America"" -- with Neal Simon to rewrite the script."
4,i was right in the thick of the book,For a first time author Mr. Abrahams was able to bring all the players in the book to life at the very begining. It seemed funny to me that I thought which way the story was going but was taken down a different path altogether which keep the pages turning until the end. Thrillers are not my first choice of pleasure reading but I am glad I took a chance with his book.
2,Great start and a miserable finish,I had great hopes for this work. It started off great but really seemed to have lost its focus. This book is not worth the energy.
3,"A good read, but...","With the hype on the cover I thought I was in for some truly great stuff, but the book turned out to be rather predictable for the most part. I identified more with the villian than the heroine, simply because the heroine wasn't very well developed and, I thought, rather one-dimensional; your typical damsel-in-distress. Worth the read, but you should probably just wait for the inevitable movie."
3,Mixed reaction - exciting but badly plotted,"Summary: an average thriller. The other book I read by Abrahams, The Tutor, was far, far superior.Let's start with the plus: the book was exciting and definitely an entertaining read.The minuses: I counted three implausible coincidences that mar the story (see below -- to be avoided if you haven't read the book). The resolution is not completely satisfactory either.Plotting mistakes: 1) the phone call to the radio show which Roger somehow overhears; 2) the lover meeting the wife at her tennis club -- couldn't this have been arranged better?; 3) the lover discovering the cheating husband is actually cheating on her -- the whole scene is very implausible. What is frustrating is that each of these developments could have been avoided pretty easily in my opinion."
1,Outstandingly vulgar.,"Don't make the mistake of trying to read this book. In the first thirty pages, three sex scenes occur, all in detail. No plot whatsoever. This book is also very illicit and immoral. Not worth your time."
4,A gripping read,"This is a perfect novel about cheaters and what happens when they are found out, but with a twist of an ending.Easily readable with a smooth plot, likeable characters, and a snappy little moral tale about what happens when we betray the one we love.A perfect summer-time read on the beach, in the house, or out loud at the bridge club meeting!!!Two thumbs way way up!"
1,too little value for money,"There is simply no more in it than in a pocket dictionary, which, considering the size and price of this book, is definitely not good enough. Serious students of Finnish would be better off with, for example, the Standard Finnish Dictionary (Finnish-English English-Finnish), published by Continuum in London and widely used in Finland. Athough it will cost you a little more, it will give you more far more information and much better coverage of the language."
2,Nice Tribute but little real information,"The four films included in this one tape are interesting but have only a few bits of information for those who like trivia and the excitement of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo era. END"
3,Love it!,"I first saw this movie on the History channel and was looking for it everywhere and everywhere I looked it cost a lot, until I found a good deal on here. I think it's a good educational movie on pirates and the actors did a good job at bringing the characters to life. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves pirates as much as I do."
5,True Caribbean Pirates (History Channel) DVD,Harrr... As always the History Channel has another great pirate DVD! This is a great collection to my pirate DVD's!
2,Not durable,"Clear backboard is made up of flimsy plastic attached by plastic screws. I wish I had noticed that the clear backing was a piece that would need to be attached, then I would have realized that this is not at all durable. We purchased this in March and the backboard already fell off and blew away. I wish I would have spent less money but received a much better product."
1,Sounds like a high quality demo and not a finished product,"While King's playing is excellent, I fail to see how his introductions and solos make any reference to the songs chosen on ""Moon Magic."" King's musicians on Moon Magic are competent, but lack imagination. Overall, ""Moon Magic"" sounds like a high quality demo and not a finished product."
3,talent squandered,"The author is more a poet than a novelist. In a shorter piece that might be fine, but here she loses the forest for the trees too often. Attention to minutiae bogs down the work over and over. For a more successful treatment of such material see Berlinski's Fieldwork."
1,Problem the the PDM-1040,"When I received my PDM-1040 it would not load a DVD in the upright position. I called Polaroid customer service and was told that they would send a new power cord that might solve the problem. Of course it did not, later I found that the unit would skip badly in the horizontal position. It took Polariod a month to finally send a replacment unit. Their customer service group has been out of the model and can't get any more, they replaced it with a DPA-10040K after many calls. The new unit works fine but does not have a back of the seat case or headphone. I am still negotiating that."
5,Planter Caddy,"Absolutely GREAT!!! Cannot find a better price for this size caddy for large planters. I have a lemon, lime, tangerine, and a orange trees that I must bring in every winter and this rolling caddy is the ticket to easy moving of any large planters you may have. It is a must to have! Makes life much easier.. Can't say enough about the price and quality of this item :-)"
5,perfect for our application,"We have a large beautiful palm tree in a basket type base. Our dogs simply would not stop peeing on it. We wrapped the base in heavy clear vinyl, but until we put the ""coaster on wheels"" under it, we still had a mess, and smell on our hands. This little device has solved the clean up problem as everything flows to the tile, and all we have to do is push gently on the coaster, (in any direction) in order to easily clean the area underneath."
5,Handy Way To Move Large Plants/Trees In Pots,"I got several of these and they are very useful for moving around pots with large plants. I did try with one that was too heavy, but all-in-all, this is a helpful product for the gardener.It is especially great to be able to move large plants/trees so they get the correct amount of light or get them out of a windstorm or in out of the cold. They are easy to use and I'm 5'1 and don't have a lot of upper-body strength.I recommend these."
2,cheezy wheels,"the wheels on these ""caddys"" are inferior, they arrived in pieces due to the horrible packing job ,which standard, unfortunately, for all items I have received from Amazon lately . Any CDs I have bought from Amazon usually have a few cases cracked from poor packing . Having said that, Amazon did send a replacement promptly . But it is an unnecessary ordeal if the shipping department had done the proper job . BACK TO THE ""CADDYS"" they do not work on any rug with even a slight nap . hard surfaces only and the wheel design is lacking and already falling apart ."
2,Wheels don't rotate well,"I purchased this for a large plant, maybe weighing 75 pounds, for use on a hardwood floor. Once the pot is on this thing, the wheels don't turn or rotate. Either the wheels are of a cheaper quality or this can't handle the weight. The item details should specify the weight capacity."
1,"40"" quad hopper","This specimen got past the inspectors. The couplers had burrs inside, redering them useless. This is not the norm for Bachmann. It will not stop me from using their other products."
5,Outstanding Collection w/ Many Memories,"This was my most favorite TV Western growing up in the 50's (Have Gun Will Travel). This box collection is very high quality and I have enjoyed it immensely. My initial concern was the rather large investment cost ($172.). I would have felt better having the opportunity to have bought the original 6 disc box set of season one only at first. As it turn's out, I've enjoyed the whole 5 season set and probably would've purchased it all over time anyway."
4,Great drama,"The story starts off with a pretty hefty right hook. I felt captivated after the first episode and watched as much as time permitted. The animation was really well executed, the characters have an extraordinary amount of depth, and the story has more than enough plot twists to keep you on your seat.I found this anime to be more of a drama type than action type, which caught me off guard when looking back at the trailers and reading the product description. Mind you, this isn't a bad thing. Where the series lacks in action, it makes up for in character development and plot. The first half of Xam'd was truly the best of the series. The second half, however, felt like it was starting to stray off base and lose momentum. Regardless, I highly recommend this anime to just about anyone that enjoys a good story, with or without action driven content."
4,Entertaining,"If you like steampunk, mechs, and typical Japanese lover's drama than you will like this series. It is not heavy on plot, but is heavy on action and from the start goes at 100 percent speed."
4,"Very nice but,....","Piece is very nice but, the piece I received is much darker than the picture. Top and base are dark stain and body of piece is a darker antique finish than I expected. I think I will keep the piece anyway, it is very nice."
3,Large Armoire,"This jewelry armoire holds a lot of jewelry and accessories. Arrived very quickly and packaged very well for shipping. Basic assembly. I am dissapointed with the ""antiqued parchment"", appears to be a yellow color to me and the lid and base is too dark of a stain for my taste. Handpainting looks beautiful. Overall, this piece looks like a family heirloom in my master bedroom."
5,Beautiful Jewelry Armoire,"This is a beautiful, heavy jewelry armoire. Prettier than the picture!Willygoat is an excellent seller to purchase this item from!"
1,Damaged product sent TWICE,"First, we received the armoire with a very noticable scratch on the bottom. Amazon arranged for a second armoire to be delivered. The second armoire was damaged even WORSE than the first. Very poor quality control to send out a REPLACEMENT item that is damaged. I must say that amazon was very nice to deal with in resolving this matter. This might be a nice item IF you are lucky enough to get one undamaged."
5,The wife couldn't have been happier,"Nicely done, functional and looks great in the master bedroom. It is probably the prettiest jewelry armoire I have seen to date. Its tall and fits our Mediterranean decor. I have bought my wife all types of gifts over the years (some pricey) and she said this was the coolest gift I have ever given her. Here's a hint, buy it and give it to her for no particular reason."
4,Good,"Received the product in a timely manner. The picture was an accurate portrayal of the armoire. Bought it for my wife who loves vintage furniture. Gave a good vintage feel however material was clearly 'cheapish', but I guess I should have been able to guess that given the price. It definitely serves its purpose and my wife loves it. Solid buy for this value but not worth much more than that."
4,As Expected,"First armoire shipped had a manufacturer defect. The veneer wasn't adhering to the carving just below the lid. Sent back and kept the second delivery. My opinion is that the product is a good $50-$75 overpriced. The main reason is the construction of the drawers is slightly below average. However, there really isn't anything on the market that compares to the look and functionality of this armoire, so you still won't find a better value. Our daughter will love it and and it will last many many years."
4,"Great Song, can't find the rest","Choir of Life was on an internet radio station, and it is truly lush and complex, with many singers. It's the only song I've heard, but it inspired me through my fruitless search. Wish I could hear more."
2,"Nice, but blocks camera","Nice feel, snug compact and luxurious. Fatal flaw: The camera lens and flash are partially blocked by the cutout, making it necessary to remove the case for quality pictures. I suspect the soft plastic keyboard cover won't last long with repetitive removal and reinstallation."
5,Great movie,"I bought this movie after renting it from the library. I thought this was a great movie. Ryan Phillippe has served his country and now his tour of duty is up. As he prepares to finish his commitment with the military, he learns he is issued a stop-loss and must continue in the military. As a result of this, he goes AWOL and his fellow soldiers try to bring him back before he faces trouble with his Commanding officer."
3,Liked the actors.,I thought the actors were good and the direction as well. If it were more my type of movie it may have received more stars.
4,hi,i love this solders who sacrive there live for us. but is sad when they died and when they had stoploss
2,Skip this one unless you are desperate,"Stop Loss was a swing and a miss - the topic is interesting and one that hasn't received a lot of attention (soldiers required to reup). However, for all its intentions, the movie misses the target and becomes a mess of disjointed portrayals of flashback induced psychological struggles for the main characters. Bad choices by two of the primary actors (Phillippe and Cornish) to attempt to Texas accents end up having them sound mentally deficient in Phillippe's case - or just plain unintelligible in the case of Cornish. Cornish's performance is flat and uninteresting - a total snoozer. Phillippe started out rather engaging and was strong in the scene where he gave an akward speeech at his home town welcome parade - however his attempts at portraying stronger emotions felt forced and over the top. Bad directing and a poor script added to the mess of the film. Rating is two stars because some of the supporting cast was worth watching - otherwise skip this one."
4,Better than people say it is!,"I thought this was a great film with a great cast. I heard alot of people didn't like it, and I can't understand why. It's very moving, and keeps you involved from beginning to end. Definitly worth seeing."
3,Stop-Loss Misses the Target,"We watched ""Stop-Loss"" last night but my husband (a Vietnam vet) called it slow and I thought it lacked the impact it was meant to have. I see MTV produced it and I think they wasted too much time trying to be hip with video collages and rap music at the beginning (and later at the end). They also did not include enough ""bonding"" time to introduce the soldiers they were going to track with the audience so you would care more deeply about their predicament. They should have patterned it after ""The Boys in Company C"" but ended up producing a story that stumbled along uncertainly from one character crisis to the next. The scenes of the mangled soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital were moving but would have been more so if the character of the patient that served with the central character had been more developed. I notice Ciaran Hinds played the father but wasn't given much to work with either. Too bad really, since the point of the film needed to be made stridently."
1,The worst post Iraq/Afghanistan war movie made to date,"As a former soldier and Iraq and Afghanistan wars veteran. Who was affected by stop loss. This is by far the worst post Iraq/Afghanistan war movie ever made. They had the wrong defenition of the meaning of the term stop loss. They should have gotten input from real soldiers before they made this movie. This movie sucks, is the bottom line."
3,Stop Loss by Brandon,"This movie was o.k. I thought it would be better than it was. The story was good and so were the actors, but it had too many cliches and the movie was too drawn out. Average."
4,Accurate Portrayal,"I am not going to say that this is a great movie. The premise is good, but the story drags on far too long. It is a very accurate portrayal of the government's disregard for soldiers' welfare and the fallout of an ill-conceived conflict. It is difficult to separate politics from a review due to the nature of the film. The film is not lacking because of what it portrays or the way it portrays it, it is lacking in the overall style of the filmmaker. I give it four stars because of the honest approach it takes to a difficult subject. Right or wrong, many young people are dying."
4,Resolution solution,I needed a card to support 1440 X 900 resolution for 19 inch wide screen LCD monitor. Just plugged it in and it worked. I like that.
2,"If it doesn't work, here is something to try","I bought my PNY Verto 5500 AGP a month ago and after numerous system freezes (within 10 minutes of boot), I finally found this document. I went through all the steps listed in the reponse from UncleMacro testing after each step to see if the problem was resolved. The last one (number 5) actually fixed the problem by slowing down my AGP bus to 1x. I can run all my 3D applications now without the system freezing. Hope this works for any of you that may be experiencing the same problem.http://www.techsupportforum.com/archive/index.php/t-49095.html"
3,A900 combo pack,"I bought this pack for the 3 pieces: home charger, car charger and extended battery. The extended battery came with a new cover, something other batteries don't include.I wound up returning this pack because the body glove phone case did not fit with the larger extended battery. The quality of the chargers seemed on the inexpensive side - I bought a rugged car charger at Sprint.Bargaincell was easy and quick to deal with and they credited my account as soon as the item was returned by them."
3,Okay,I thought the story was okay. Seems like Hannah Howell stories are not as good as they used to be.
2,Baboons on the Road!!!,"Not Cannonball Run or Death Race 2000, but funny at times. ""Why are there so many baboons on the road?"""
2,"Nice attempt, Bad results","If you are looking to laugh outloud while watching a movie, then buy this movie right away and watch it. However, you will only be laughing at the utter stupiditiy that must have gone though the minds of the directors while making this film. With no big name stars, and basically no plot at all, this film amazingly earned 2 stars in this review because it made me laugh at it's simple, pathetic attempt at cinema. An international race through the African Safari? Wow! I do not know where the idea for this film came from, nor do I really care to find out. I am glad I watched it however, because now I have the honor of claiming that I have seen the worst movie ever produced in the history of film making. Own it. Watch it. Laugh at it."
2,Not much like the old stuff,"The happy joy stuff is gone. More moody deeper tracks, with highly developed lyrics."
4,Another Good LIGHNING SEEDS effort,"""Happy Satellite"" and ""Get It Right"" are the two standout tracks on TILT. Prevous CD ""Dizzy Heights"" was more satisfying due to its fun guitar work missing from ""Tilt"" which is still a good record."
4,So many possibilities,"If you are interested in crafting or just want to add that special touch to your home, this book is a good way to get started. Not only does the author explain in detail the tools you will need to create that masterpiece, she also explains interesting techniques and design ideas. Directions are very easy to follow. Really jumpstarts your creativity"
5,An absolute must have!,"Full of jackin' beats and soulful melodies, this mix may be the best of the summer. Colette and dj Heather deliver the goods.Both discs are excellent. My favorite tracks include #3 & #9 on disc1. And #'s 9-12 on disc2. You buy now. Love long time!"
4,"MIXED BAG OF A HOUSE SET, BUT FUN OVERALL","Hi,This disc set is basically a party in a box, so it's great music to have playing in the background with your other party discs. And it's still pretty fresh for being out a couple of years. Many of these songs are still on the standard rotation at some of the bars I go to. They even play it at my gym!I like the first disc because it's more varied. It has some great standout tracks too, like #3 Sunshine and # 13 4 AM. I would buy this disc just for these two tracks. Heathers disc is VERY monotonous, even though it has the biggest club hit of the two discs. I still hear it EVERYWHERE I go.I would also reccommend the first disc for people who like to run. I buy this kind of music to run to and this is a good one and will keep you going. There is nothing like taking a breather from running on the bridge in beautiful Balboa Park in San Diego when 4AM is playing. I swear, it gave me such a runners high, i could have just kept going and going!"
5,Powerful grooves and lyrics,"I got this album after listening to shoki shoki and seeing Femi live, it keeps getting better... Great music that grooves and informs."
2,Strictly for the scientific minded,I'm no idiot (I have an honours degree in psychology and an MBA) but this book was completely incomprehensible to me. If I lived in the States I would have returned it! I suspect only readers with a scientific education can appreciate this book - and maybe they'll find it excellent - but it definitely is not for the generalist.
1,Is the Universe in 'tune'?,"People have been trying for years to prove that the founding cause of the Universe is natural occuring harmonies. These theories are usually the occult disguising itself as science. If these theories are correct there needs to be a 'fundamental' frequency (a demiurge style 'god of harmony') to begin the resonance. No such thing exists - see Scientific American, August 2005 'Is the Universe Out of a Tune?'"
2,Platter,I don't think I would but it again. It is almost exactly the same size as the dinner plates.
3,It's just okay.,"It's just okay. A bit boring with redundant moves. But it is verrry tiring, which for exercise, is a good thing!"
3,Accurate Picture of Today's Church,"Length:: 9:52 MinsThis warm and revealing movie is reflective of the confused Christianity which saturates the modern day. The church is individualistic, self-centered, and self-contradictory: this movie compliments that reality. The kids presented are beautiful; the ideas propogated are nonsensical. Watch and see why the world thinks Christianity is irrelevant."
5,A Proper Understanding of the Market,"At last, a real estate economics text that links together the finance, economics and planning aspects of the production of space. Most texts are so narrow and stuck in their own subject area. The authors cover demand for commercial space (offices, industrial real estate, shops), investment in real estate and the links to the wider economy. Unlike many US texts, it has a global perspective with a fine chapter on international investment. Well written, well researched, comprehensive references - this is an invaluable resource for professionals and for academics."
4,Parallax Pistol Rest,"Wonderful product. I sighted 5 pistol using this rest and works great. But as the other reviewer says any pistol with a barrel length of lest than 4 inches would really be a challenge, here's how i do it with a glock 26 and S&W; bodyguard.First turn the rest backward so that the part that's holding the gun is the one closer to the target and the part that you use for rest is behind it.Second. Lower the rest to as low as it would go.Third. Now making sure that the vise part is way open and not going to be hit by the bullet shoot your group of 3 into the targetFourth now that you have your group mount the pistol really tight on the vise still oriented the same way as when you shoot your group then begin to sight your laser.There you go you have sighted your compact pistol using this device. I know its a little tricky but hey there is no other sighting rest out there that works this good so with a little patience you too can make this rest workResume editing"
1,"Typical ""End Times"" Stuff","Like other authors of ""End Times"" claims, Jeffrey doesn't understand the true meaning of real prophecy, prefering to buy into the idea that a God of Wrath will destroy the world, along with all the sinners and heathen and pagans ... and, of course, deliver all the ""saved and born-again Christians"" to heaven. Fortunately, there are good books available that tell the truth, such as Real Prophecy Unveiled, by Joseph J. Adamson, and The Isaiah Effect, by Greg Braden. They are worth reading, while Jeffrey's book is merely right-wing [opinions] in the guise of ""God's Word."""
3,Not the new one but it'll have to do.,"I much prefer the new Gignator series. But for those who are fresh to the Anime world and the world of Gigantor, this is for you."
3,wrist band too small for a man's wrist,"wrist band too small for a man's wrist, beautiful watch for a woman since the watch itself is quite small"
3,Good introduction to mainstream Goth,"A pretty upbeat collection, I would imagine to introduce the unfamiliar, or placate worried parents. The regulars are there like FOTN, Bauhaus, Killing Joke and Sisters Of Mercy, even though Andrew Eldritch is now an ""Industrial Groove Machine"", and denounces the Goth label. NIN give the listener a soft introduction to Industrial Goth, and Alien Sex Fiend harken back to the Post Punk days. I found it in a charity shop years ago, it's great to have in the car if you don't want to bring all your albums, and a good introduction for young kids sick of the older, gnarly Goths pulling rank by talking about the good old days of Full Tilt at the Ballroom."
3,First time used purchase,Sadly disappointed by purchase. However this is a situation of you get what you paid for. Will definately be wary of used purchases in the future.
4,More about Preventing Problems with Employees,"This book has a lot of good advice on how to prevent problems with employees, and on how to set up systems so that problem employees can be either counseled to improve or gotten rid of without lawsuit fallout. It is also useful in that the authors emphasize that treating all employees in the same way will lead to improved office morale.In particular, the authors' recommendation to document everything in personnel files is laudable. If a problem employee has gone too far, this book won't help an employer though -- an employment lawyer will be needed."
3,Not as good as the first book,"I LOVED ""The Boy Next Door,"" but this book is not nearly as good. It had some enjoyable moments - mostly involving minor favorite characters from the first book, such as Dolly Vargas - but overall, the storyline and character development was vastly inferior to the first book and to Cabot's ""Princess Diary"" books, which I also love. Kate Mackenzie is so neurotic and so full of self-hatred, I kept wanting to shake her and scream, ""Pull yourself together, for God's sake!""Also, I understand from Cabot's website that this book is being marketed to her younger fans, which I find highly inappropriate in light of the book's language and content. Characters make a lot of sexual jokes ...I hear Cabot is working on another sequel. Let's hope it's an improvement!"
5,:-),I love books like this one. These are the books that make you sad when you are done reading it because you don't want it to end; you want to know what happens after that. Meg Cabot is by far my favorite author and I enjoy all of her books. This book is my favorite so far. I loved the characters and how everything tied in. The format of it was perfect. Her books make you fall in love with reading.
5,Meg Cabot Outdoes Herself!,"Meg Cabot truly outdoes herself in this book! Throughtout ""Boy Meets Girl"", you follow Kate Mackenzie through her not-so-typical life. You laugh with her, you cry with her, and you get frustrated with her. This book reminded me of All American Girl, but had a completely different story line It was beautifully composed with a series of journal entries, emails, written tape recordings, and instant messenger conversations. This story is truly unique and i would recommend any fans of her work to read it! Boy Meets Girl was an phenominal book!"
5,Loved this book!,"This is the first book I read by Meg Cabot and I just absolutely loved it!! Can't wait on reading more from her. Written in e-mail format.. it takes a little while to get used to it, but once you do, you cannot stop reading. Loved the characters and the plot!! Funny, romantic, drama!! everything a good chic lit book should have!! I just wish they would make this book into a movie. I sure would be standing in line!"
4,Funny and enjoyable story,"I love this chic lit book. It was upbeat and funny. I love the characters! Just like other Cabot books, it was easy to read and easy to enjoy."
4,Fun read,"I liked BOY MEETS GIRL. It was a fun read that made me laugh out loud (at times). It's told through emails and ims just like THE BOY NEXT DOOR. But this book also included answering phone messages and journal entries from the main character, Kate Mackenzie. Although this was a funny read, I'd have to say I liked THE BOY NEXT DOOR better."
3,"Very quick, fun, enjoyable read... however...","What I could not stand about this book was that every character sounded like the same character. The characters all had the same manner of speaking and clarifying what they meant by saying 'blah blah blah... I mean...'We know who and what the characters were talking about and to have every character speak the same way was a bit irritating.I really loved the story because I can relate to it, but this book really lacks a lot of character development. But it was a fun read regardless."
5,Boy Does Indeed Meet Girl,"I thought it was a very unique approach to a book to write it soley through emails, letters, and journal entries. It made it interesting to get the plot from conversations between the characters through these mediums. Kate is a completely likable character, and although I found her and Mitch's courtship unrealistic, I was rooting for it the whole time. The TOD was my favorite character because she was funny and cast as the ""bad guy"". All in all, one of the best chick lit books out there."
4,"Good, Fast Meg Cabot Read","Having read The Boy Next Door in a few hours, I picked up Boy Meets Girl knowing I could get through it quickly. I'd say this book was not quite as good as The Boy Next Door (I gave that a 4.5), but towards the end it was very, very funny! The only complaint I have is that the lead character Kate got repetative in her constant overthinking by the end...I think in the Boy Next Door, the same dynamics existed for that main character, but she seemed less helpless than Kate. Anyway, I'd still pick it up and read it, especially great for an afternoon to relax - it literally took me about 3 hours to finish! I look forward to other Meg Cabot books because they're just fast and funny reads. Enjoy!"
3,And they all lived happily ever after,"This book is so engagingly written -- with a narrative consisting solely of journal entries, emails, voicemail messages, etc. -- that I found it almost impossible to put down. Ms. Cabot's style is so winning that it wasn't until I was done with the book that I realized how completely implausible it was. I'm not at all sorry I read it because it was so much fun. I just know I won't remember much about it by this time next month, except, maybe, how Ms. Cabot wrote it. I guess this is what's meant by ""style over substance,"" huh?"
4,A good beach read,"This is a light, enjoyable read great for an afternoon of just relaxing. If you're looking for a masterpiece, look somewhere else. If you're looking for some chick-lit, this will work."
4,"A fun, fast read.",Do not read this if you are looking for depth.It is a fun read that had me laughing out loud!!
4,Now why didn't I think of that?,"This is the same author who wrote the sweet and funny Princess Diaries series for teens. But this book is definitely for grown-ups. It is the tale of a twentysomething human resources manager at a New York city newspaper. Her crazy boss, nicknamed the Tyrannical Office Despot, makes our heroine fire the beloved cafeteria cookie lady. The cookie lady then sues the newspaper for wrongful termination. Our heroine winds up giving a deposition and falls in love with the newspaper's cute lawyer. The best part about this book is that it is written entirely in e-mails, letters and journal entries. Now why didn't I think of that?"
4,A good practical approach,"I tried drugs and had a very bad reaction to them. This book is a compendium of various alternatives that can help, if you have enough energy and stamina to try them for a few weeks. I have found the ones I have tried to be very helpful, and the information is presented clearly, simply, and without being a downer to read and full of sad case studies! It gets right to the point, too. The author is not presenting magic tricks, though some of what she suggests I dont have much faith in (Bach Flower Remedies) most other things (like meditation) I have found very effective. Some of her advice I have not seen anywhere else, but have discovered for myself and its nice to get the confirmation here. On the whole, this is one of the best books on depression I have read. Not great for someone who hopes reading a book will do the trick, but good for anyone who wants to try doing something for themselves."
1,I guess it's a generational thing......,"As a Boomer, I kept waiting for a movie to develop, but it never did. Just a disjointed series of vignettes, which although funny for the first 5 minutes, gets mind-numbingly boring thereafter. In other words, it was 119 minutes of my life I will never get back."
2,"too long, not enough laughs","Some funny bits but not a great movie thats worth sitting through. If you like dogs, there are some cute ones to see."
4,Dry snarky humor for a solid cast,"A show about extremely strange people that show dogs. The jokes alot of the time come from the commitment to each persons strange quirks, more so then just a funny joke.Almost all the actors are second string for comdies but all have been in tons of movies and give first string performances."
5,Funny. Without shedding.,"These folks just make very witty, intelligent moves that also happen to be extremely funny. Maybe hardcore dog people won't find this funny, as it hits pretty close to home, but regular folks should find it amusing. Fred Willard is fantastic as the commentator of the dog show."
1,Turned it off in less than ten minutes!!,"There was no trailer to preview. Started the movie thinking it was okay to watch because of the rating and it was about dogs (pets). The sexual focus right at the beginning of the movie was so terrible and unnecessary within the first ten minutes that we shut it off. Whether it's a parody or not, we just don't need to watch a movie that bad. We wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone."
3,Best in show movie.,"It was ok a little to silly for me. I thought all the Adults acted very,very strange ! But OK"
2,smaller than expected & poor customer service,the product arrived in a damaged box and the fire pit was smaller than expected. When I called customer service they were very unhelpful and rude. I wouldn't buy from this amazon vendor again
1,Received torn plastic cover for fire pit,"Received the Bravo Fire Pit with a screen lid and a plastic cover.I put together the fire pit and then opened the bag with the plastic coverand it was torn in a few places. I returned the plastic coverto exchange it for a new one and the same plastic cover was returned back to mea few weeks later with a note saying that it must be returned with all the partsfor an exchange. How crazy is that! I need to return the whole fire pit, screen lid and plastic cover to just exchange the plastic cover. They willing to pay shipping for a large fire pit and then again shipping to deliver it back to me verse the cost of postage on a small plastic cover. This is after I paid for the postage of having the fire pit delivered within few days and now having to wait for it again. This doesn't make sense to me because they just could of mailed a new plastic cover to me instead of returning the torn one. I am not happy with this purchase from Amazon."
1,Don't Bother!,"We bought this firepit from Plow and Hearth (same exact model, etc.) The very first time we used it, the spark screen caved in and nearly melted from the heat, and it was only a small fire! The cover that comes with it is flimsy, and tore within a few weeks. I think we used the firepit 2 or 3 times (only once with the screen, obviously), and it's ready for the trash. Don't waste your money!"
1,garbage,"The fire pit arrived with 2 dents. The unit scratches and dents from normal handling. After 1 week - stored in a garage - the screws are rusting. The lid doesn't fit snugly - keeps falling into the fire. After 1 use, I donated to Goodwill for the tax writeoff - not worth anymore of my time. Don't buy it!"
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"I can't believe this was so cheaply made. NOT made to last more than one season, plus the lid doesn't fit right. We are returning it. DON'T waste your money!!!"
4,Thorough treatment of English Grammar. Not a usage guide.,"I read this book from front to back. It is a thorough treatment of English grammar. For those looking for a usage guide- do not look here. It would probably serve as a good reference book for writers, teachers and non-linguistic scholars who would appreciate the abundance of examples given. For the average reader, they will tire of the enumeration of boring, useless-to-most-people aspects of grammar. On the other hand, if you're just curious about grammar, as I was, it can be very educational."
3,Lacks completeness; difficult for reference,"First of all, I'm not a scholar. I wanted to learn greek, but found my English grammar lacking. In many areas this would certainly help in learning the grammar of a foreign language. The index uses sections rather than pages in looking up a subject. The sections can be quite long and finding the particular item may be timely. ""Periphrastic tenses"" for instance. I never could get a clear/complete definition of what this is. I still use it more than my other less complete/elementary grammar texts. But it is not ideal for what I need. I am still learning the layout of subject matter. It certainly is not intuitive--for a non-scholar anyway."
2,I didn't like it.,I am a brazilian student. I prefer that book instead because it is more pedagogical:Cambridge Grammar of English Paperback with CD ROM: A Comprehensive Guide (Cambridge Grammar of English)
3,felt like many details were missing,"this book was very interesting, but often I felt that the writer skimmed over time periods that demanded more explanation and detail. Overall, tho it was a good book."
1,boring....,I bought this book for my son who is in prison and appreciates all the books I can send him....even with nothing to do he ended up putting this book down...he said he would enjoy watching paint dry better then this book...I chose this book as he enjoys historical stories and the revues were good....I think the revues were purchased by the author as no way are we discussing the same book.....I am sorry but I doubt that you should waste your time...
4,The pink I just file folders,I just completed going through my file box and I now have all my files in pink.. they look really nice and I like the way they are just like the other folders but in pink so the fit in the file box just right!
5,s,love becase now i can put all my paper work in these folders and file them a way and go right to it when i am ready and dont have to look thought all the papers and look for things and i could put my hands right on what i am looking for
5,Lavender File Folders,"If you love color, these lavender file folders are for you. Made with 10% recycled paper in the USA. Great buy for organizing your office, classroom, craft center, or business."
5,Love These,Nice to have a bright and cheery color for ordinary office work. I also like the fact that they are reversible
5,Perfect,I love these pink folders! Great accent to my office. Will only use these pretties for my very best clients.
5,great book,"One of my favorite things about this book: a chapter that explains how US cities were forced to shift their budget priorities in a very similar way to structural adjustment programs in the global south (it was the bond rating agencies instead of the IMF/World Bank). In general the book is a good read for undergraduates with some guidance. Its also great for people who have read a bunch of urban political economy because Hackworth provides thoughtful syntheses of the theories that are out there, and then goes on to discuss his take through case studies."
1,Did not buy this product,Why?? Because I couldn't find anywhere in the description how much rice I'd get for $9.16. Has anyone bought it under those conditions?
3,Not as good as webkinz,"I took my five year old daughter webkinz shopping and she saw the ty girlz and decided she wanted one instead - since they are the same price I thought we could try it - well the online world is very limited after being used to webkinz. The rooms can contain a bed, rug, lamp and chair and that's it - only 4 themes to choose from. The dolls can get new looks online at the beauty salon - but there really isn't that much to do - the games are too hard for her to play by herself, so her choices are to shop for clothes, shop for hairdo's or shop for furniture - and she runs out of ""money"" very quickly - I had my 9 year old help her play for awhile - but they both agree that Webkinz is way better and this probably won't last...I won't buy another but will get her a new webkinz soon."
1,Boo,This is a total copy of webkinz. Someone made a review of a webkinz and said this was better. It's not. They're horribly made dolls that copy webkinz.
3,Having actually read the book...,"Unlike either of the other two reviewers, I did read the book. I grew up in a de facto cessationalist church, meaning that we did not practice the more obviously supernatural gifts, but we never were taught anything for or against such practice. When I went to college, I started going to a Vineyard church, leading me to become curious about the practice of the charismatic gifts.In this book, Campolo seems to have a very particular audience: he is writing to the churchgoer who is suspicious about but not dead-set against charismatic practices. In my position, having read both extremes of position (i.e. MacArthur's _Charismatic Chaos_ and MacNutt's _Healing_), this book did feel like it backtracked quite a bit from where I stood.If you're considering a more open understanding of Pentecostal/charismatic churches than a total cessationalist/dispensationalist viewpoint, then this might be a good place to start."
1,Blah,"I bought this book when I was attending a Pentecostal church that was very unbalanced and unscriptural about their view of and use of tongues (way overboard actually). It was no help. It is very rare for me to not finish a book, but this is one I did not finish. The author's tone was very self important. The first part of the book was more about finger pointing at misguided people, like a traveling preacher whose wife mingled with the crowd and radiod information to his ear piece so he could look spirit filled. This information is worthless for someone trying to find out more about spiritual gifts, especially tongues. Far better would be to get a concordance and just study the Bible yourself than to wade through this blah book looking for the missing insight."
2,Not what I thought it was,This thing contains a piece of red film that rotates around a light bulb.KINDA CHEAP
1,Terrible!,"Only lasted a couple of hours, don't waste your money if you expect the light to work at all."
1,Junk,"I hate to say it, but this item is junk. I bought one, it worked okay for a few days, then got really loud and the spinning motor kept getting stuck. I returned it, got a new one and same thing. It worked well for about 12 hours of use (not consecutive) ,and then the motor had problems spinning and it made a loud grinding noise. Do NOT get this one, try a different rotating light."
3,High hopes,"In the Latin West, Christians do not hear enough about John Chrysostom. After reading about the Orthodox East who place more of an emphasis on this man, I decided to read about him and to read some of his works. This book was absolutely perfect for that. It includes some historical information and then a sampling of his surviving works. The translation is very readable.However, please be prepared for something that I found upsetting when reading this book -- chunks of his writing are intentionally left out by the editor/translator in a FEW sections during the middle of a chapter. For example, in a sermon about the conflict between St. Peter and St. Paul the editor basically includes only the introduction and the conclusion. Just when things start to get interesting in this sermon all of the sudden it says ""We skipped this portion""!? This was irksome, but overall I'm glad I bought the book."
5,Must have for a healthy life!! Good for pets as well!,"Recommended! Probiotics are a must for healthy bacteria in your system especially since using antiobiotics, which kills ALL bacteria, good & bad. It's what makes yogurt important but without the dairy. Uses plant formula for the bacteria strains, so it's more absorbable. Use it for my dogs;works great on them along with hemp oil. Just half a tablet per day:myself I don't use these multiple takings; about 2 for myself. That's fine...better than not taking it!!!"
2,disappointing,There's no indication of how much your getting only the ingredients. I found the parent company and contacted them and they said it was to be used with a multi-vitamin and they couldn't give me the amount of ingredients either. At least the person I spoke wilth couldn't do that.
5,Excellent Product for making sure you get all your greens!,I have been buying this product every month for years now. It is an excellent product to make sure you get all your greens.
3,Dissappointed with these greens,I have been taking these super greens for about a month now. They are a large green pill and they taste awful. They go down better with milk. Other wise I struggle to swallow. I have not seem much of a difference in how I feel. I had better luck with a green I had been purchasing from a local health food store.I bought a three month supply. So I will be taking them for a couple more months. The amazon price was the best price I could find. So if you want to try them. I would recommend you buy them here.
5,An Award Winning Masterpiece is somewhat unappreciated,"Based on the mixed reviews, you would think this DVD was some kind garage video. Not so. First, you have to accept the fact that the musical score is not orchestral, but a seminal electronic work of the 70's. The animation, while not up to Imax standards, is animation created by NASA to inform the public. Certainly NASA never figured it for art, but that's what it is. This is an informative, interesting musical video experience. If you want a dry stupid documentary, stay with the Learning Channel and their UFO shows."
2,Wasn't what I thought it was...,When I ordered this DVD I thought I was getting the original classical score. NOT TRUE. It is an electronic interpretation. Classical Holst fans beware.
1,USB 1.1 not 2.0,"Be warned, this is not a USB 2.0 hub. USB 2.0 is over half a decade old, there is no reason for this to even exist."
4,THE Classic book on language acquisition,"When this book came out, it contained powerful research that helped put ESL learning in perspective. It's heavy, written at an academic level, but has some classic research in it, and helped put a foundation on developmental ESL. There are good insights if you are willing to work through it."
3,"Yep, it's vitamins","I like that I only have to take a tablespoon and it was like the vitamin supplement recommended by a low carb book. I liked the range of vitamins and minerals included. I don't like the taste very much - it's a little bitter (from the Xylitol I guess). I put it in my flavored tea in the morning to try to mask the bitterness. Hubby tries to just take it with a little water and he can hardly stand it.Unfortunately it has little clumps of vitamin that come out each time (even after shaking). So I usually have residue in the bottom of the cup which is not pleasant to see or taste when I'm to the bottom of my tea. I don't know if that is normal since my bottle had a leak when it was shipped. It looked like it was sealed but I wonder if the quality was compromised during shipping. At this point though, I don't see myself buying more of it and it will be a chore to finish the bottle I have."
4,I can take this one!,"Any liquid vitamins are going to have some bitter taste. But I would agree with other reviewers that this one is LESS unpleasant than most. It has a sweet taste to cover it up, so I can totally take it long-term and not get sick of it."
3,It's pretty nice,"The design is wonderful. The tilt is adjustable. It's great for watching DVDs, but get up close and you'll notice that it suffers from not having a DVI connection; text looks like it's smudged, sort of ghosty-like, even at the native resolution. If you're just looking for a flat panel television then it's great, but if you need a computer monitor look for something with a digital interface."
5,Truly a great album!,"This is truly a great album that grows on me every listening! There is so much new I hear each time that makes me love it more and more. I honestly was a little skeptical because I'm not as huge a Coleman fan as a Coltrane one, but this first Cherry album (after leaving Coleman) is just absolutely great!"
1,Did not work for me.,This product did not or at least has not worked for me. I have been using it religiously twice a day as instructed for almost a month and i havent seen a change yet. My skin is the same. I have cellulite on the inside of my thighs which i want to get rid of. i workout 2 hrs a day 6 days a week and apply this treatment as instructed. Its not working. My legs are getting smaller and a little toner due to excersise but the dimple have mot diminished in the slightest. Im disapointed. On to the next one.
3,CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION,"Mechanically, this is a great microphophone stand B A S E. It is not as pictured. It is NOT the entire microphone stand.I REPEAT IT IS NOT AS PICTURED. YOU WILL JUST RECEIVE THE LITTLE, BLACK, WEIGHTED DISC AT THE BOTTOM.It is NOT the entire microphone stand.It does a great good job, if that's all you need. I thought I was getting the whole microphone stand, so I had to return it. By the way, just for a weighted base... its REALLY expensive, so I gave it three stars."
2,Tastes Like Alcohol,"I bought this liquid version because the pills seemed to be bothering my stomach. The liquid tastes like alcohol though (and not in a good way). It turns out that alcohol is the 3rd ingredient on the label. I'm not sure if that's normal. I'm giving it 2 stars because a liquid multivitamin sounds like a good idea, but it tastes so weird that I don't want to drink it everyday. I think I'll go back to the pills."
5,Good Health,"I,like a large number of people, cannot digest the covering of pills.Liquid Centrum starts digesting in the mouth and easily continues in the stomach. Liquid Centrum has maintained my health for years."
4,pretty nice,"this was my first lcd screen. got it about 10 months ago now... so far just 2 dead pixels and its hard to see them. other than the typical dead pixel problems of LCD's, the moniter has been very nice for me. i can play unreal tourny without lcd lag, and the color is, at the least, average if not above average. a good solid screen."
2,Larkin makes heros stupid!,"Mr Larkin is a good writer, but he makes his heros do things a ten year old wouldn't do playing cops and robbers.CIA female agent has to kill four men who are in a house and about to leave. Insted of waiting outside to kill them as they come out, she hits the door and starts a gun fight that lasts forever! ""Dumb for the CIA""Main hero shoots all the bad guys but doesn't check to see if they are all dead. SOOO the main bad guy gets the drop on the hero and could kill him no problem. Saved by a lady.There are many other examples such as the road block set up by the hero that allows the bad guys to just drive through.Sorry, but you can't sell heros as smart and then have them do stupid things."
1,what was he thinking?,"After reading several of Mr ludlum's earlier works, I am shocked that he would put his name on this poorly written ""book""? It is sooo boring."
4,True to the Ludlum Spirit,"Having read all of Ludlum's books, this was the first ""inspired by"" novel that I read. The novel starts slowly, and keeps on going a bit faster, and ends very fast paced. I liked the book and it does keep with the Ludlum spirit. From some reason it simply took me a very long time to read.If you enjoy Ludlum's novels you will enjoy this one also, albeit maybe not each and every word."
3,Nothing new...very similar to previous Covert-Ones,"Having read two other Covert-One novels, I did not enjoy Moscow Vector so much, particularly because the plot, suspense, and climax are very predictable and not very different from previous Covert-Ones. In short, this one has a loose plot, good suspense, but a conveniently predictable climax. Doesn't leave you dying to know what happens next. If this is the first Covert-One you're reading, I think it can be enjoyable."
4,Moscow Vector,Another great Covert-One novel. Very plausible plot. But Marty Zellerbach's character needs to be brought back along with Peter Howell's.
3,Mildly entertaining,"Some things would be better if they were left alone, including the books of Robert Ludlum. But the marketing machine must go on. This book is mildly entertaing by why it carries Ludlums name I am not sure? If you want to read Ludlum read The Bourne Identity, or one of his other great thrillers that he actually wrote. I'm sorry this did not work for me."
1,"cliched, predictable","I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style.The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating.The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest.Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead.Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent."
4,Covert One,Covert One books never disappoint. This was one that was filled with action from the first page to the last.
2,Not Great,"Patrick Larkin is hands-down my least favorite author of this series. His books are slow reading and they fail to capture the true character of Jon Smith from the previous books. For instance, in the previous Covert-One books Jon is very careful and very good at his job; now he is clumsy and keeps making mistakes that ends up in shootouts. Normally I can finish these books in a couple of days but I've had this for two months now and I'm still just half way through."
2,Dead Author,I think the practice of selling books by Authors which are written by another person is dishonest. Ludlum has been dead for a DECADE! Big business has no sense of right and wrong as long as they can make money.
3,slightly disappointed,"The magic touch of Ludlums input seems to be missing. Being a rabid fan of his (having read and re-read ALL of his offerings several times) while reading the latest of the Covert One series and waiting for the appearance of Marty Zellerbach and/or Peter Howell (neither of them occured) and frankly the the number of attempts on Jon Smith's life were, in my opinion, not only ridiculously contrived but resolved. Better luck with the next one (if there is one)."
3,little above average,"I HAVE READ QUITE A FEW OF LUDLUM BKS, THIS ONE THOUGH IN THE SAME GENERAL PLOT AND CICUMSTANCE FELL A BIT SHORT,, STILL MAKES GOOD READING,SURE WOULD RECCOMMEND IT"
2,Not logical... Somewhat entertaining.,"The ending was extremely predictable. There are no surprises in this book. The plot itself is very loosely woven. You really have to try hard to believe the chain of events in order to enjoy this book. The relationship between the deadly bio-weapon and the Russian military build-up is unnecessarily hyped. If you ask me, 3 out of 4 of the main characters should have been killed at around page 100. Fortunately, the bad guys have the insatiable urge to go into big speeches before pulling the trigger. Oh, and they are completely against killing their enemies unless they guide them to the exact 'dying spot' first. Anyway. This book was a waste of time for me."
2,A PRIVATE VIEW,"I was a bit disappointed when i looked at this book. Although the pictures in the book are nice, it's a bit messy, what was ment to give the book an 'artful' layout.Well that has certainly not worked.You should buy this book as your last choice."
5,Beautifully arranged view into a photographer's world,"If you've ever admired D'Orazio's work, you must have this book. After I read this, I felt as though I'd travelled into D'Orazio's glamorous world of fashion photography. His photographs have a sense of mood, each page has a ""feel"", I got lost for a couple of hours with it. A work of art, each photograph is like a painting. BUY THIS."
5,Stunned...,"When I first looked through the pages of this book, I was stunned. I am a freelance photographer and was looking for a good book to get ideas from. I came acrossed this one and for once I have found someone that shoots the same style that I do. It's nice to be able to find this and use it a s aguide to get more ideas from. Outstanding images, creative...don't know what else to say without showing you the book."
3,"scattered and confusing, but ""arty""","The layout of this book is certainly meant to be a scrapbook. This may have worked for the artist himself, but for us readers, it was hard to understand. The quotes on some pages are there (maybe) to contribute to the atmosphere but they are hard to read and makes it trivial and disturbing to the layout. The reference about the Thailand incident was something special though. The editing for the photographs, however, was a bit disappointing. There were a few repeating photographs ( such as the Stephine Seymores) that did not need repeating. Those spaces could have be used for other pictures of her. The number of pages is somewhat worth the price other than that, the content itself was interesting but not lasting."
5,Pete Seeger The Power of song,"For those of us who grew up in the 60's, this is a wonderful portrait of a very influential folk singer and activist. I bought this as a gift for my 30 year old daughter who is an activist today. I knew that she would enjoy seeing where her mothers' attitudes were formed and how everything Pete stood for is still so valuable today.Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could still change the world with song and togetherness, instead of anger, divisiveness and incivility that we seem to bee living with today."
5,Pete Seeger - surely an American icon,"After some 50 years of listening to popular music I recently discovered Pete Seeger. I was introduced to him by ""The Dylan DVD"". Then my daughter bought me the ""Springsteen plays Pete Seeger"" CD/DVD and I was hooked.Unfortunately I am unable to review the DVD as I sent it to my daughter in Australia. My son is currently visiting her and will return to South Africa with the DVD. I sent it there as Amazon (USA) is no longer prepared to post purchases to South Africa :-((Not as bad as Apple - Apple sells iPods in South Africa, but not iTunes."
4,Social evolution of modern folk music,"As a professional musician (with a fair amount of emphasis on folk music), I confess to having not been a ""fan"" per se of Pete Seeger's music--now I realize that I was in error. That said, I was aware of the allegations about his political views. The DVD is well produced and captures the illogic of the red-baiting that was present in the past. The filmed excerpts are edited nicely, and rebirthing the bygone spirit of those in the folk music era of the 1950s and 1960s. The sight of a batch of college-age young folks sitting around singing folk songs is refreshing. The DVD reveals that Pete Seeger has musiciological substance than I had recognized. This DVD should be included in numerous high school and college classes, and certainly merits watchng by any individual who is interested in (1) how pop culture has evolved with society and (2) high-quality folk music performances."
5,Great Film About a Great American Patriot on DVD,This is a wonderful film and I don't know why Amazon.com isn't offering it yet. It is available on PBS's Shop Thirteen website:http://www.shopthirteen.org/product/show/31668
4,Great Book,"A well written book about one person's journey to a closer relationship with Christ. I'm reading this as part of a book group, and finding it to be a wonderful example and guide."
4,Thought-provoking,"Although not directed toward men, this book had good things to say to me. Just admitting there are ""unanswered questions"", let alone saying you can find God in them, is a courageous and needful stance. A good book to stretch your soul and give expression to your heart."
2,BETTER THAN ADOBE,"the lesser THIS IS THE CASE being better ADOBE unfair buisiness practices MAY NEVER BACKFIRE ON EM, CAUSE THYVE BEEN an apple CLONE, like their customers,theyve been using the same software update after update till THEIR BRAINS HAVE TURNED TO mush, COREL IS BETTER THE BOX IS BETTER, they have a few MORE ARTISTIC MINDED PROGRAMERS AND ITS EASIER TO use,"
5,A Perfect Package,"Hands down, Draw is the best illustration software for me. I've grown up, so to speak, with Draw and feel like I can do anything anybody wants done! R.A.V.E. is easy to use and is making progress. PhotoPaint does its job with aplumb. My main point is that this suite of products is synergistic - the whole is more than the sum of its parts. If you specialize in Flash or digital photography, you can find something more powerful (note that I did not include vector illustration because Draw is the best!). But for a graphics generalist, this suite is almost perfect. The only thing they could add is a built-in content manager. I've usually got all three programs open, going back and forth as I create different elements of the final product. Final note: CorelDraw is growing in sophistication as I become more experienced."
4,An imaginative and truly retro gift,I ordered the box as a family gift for St. Nicholas Day. The selection was imaginative and interesting. The items had an authentic retro quality that I appreciated. A little chocolate in the mix would have been appreciated but we all enjoyed it.
3,Cute but Stale,My grandma loved going through all the candies and she remembered almost all of them but they were stale so we couldn't actually eat them.
3,Pretty nice assortment,"I was born in the '80s and was familiar with some of these, so either the '40s refers to the decade of their inception, or they throw in fillers. Regardless, a lot of nearly cloying treats with questionable ingredients that round out a day with a guilty snack. Well worth the $7 spent via WH Deals, but certainly wouldn't recommend purchasing this box @ full price."
4,"Expensive, But Just Cute Enough To Be Worth It","I balked a little at the price for this, but I found that it was ultimately worth it. It was a good buy and great to show some younger people of the other types of candy. The box is pseudo-collectible and worth it. Get it for fun."
3,Nice product but lousy delivery service,"The Good:The box was nicely packaged and arrived with even its bow intact. The amount of candy was abundant, the variety was good, and my father-in-law greatly enjoyed reminiscing over the various gums and hard candies.The Bad:When my order from Candy Crate was six days overdue, I emailed the company and received a quick reply. I was assured my product would arrive shortly. I had to send another email after an additional two days complaining that it was Christmas Eve and the package hadn't arrived. Candy Crate contacted the delivery company, refunded my delivery charges, and apologized. Their customer service responses were quick and congenial but I wouldn't order from them unless you plan way ahead or they change the delivery company with whom they work."
1,40s Retro was 40s stale,"Overall the selection is interesting and reminds me of the candy that my grandparents had at their house, even though there were many uninspired items that are common today. The quality is rather poor and a good percentage of the items were stale or inedible due to their hardness. Even without the stale candy, the value was lacking since most of this candy is still common today and available in the bulk candy section of supermarkets. I would reccomend that you skip this one.I bought this as a spare christmas gift (you know for the person who shows up with a gift but you forgot) and didn't need it. I was excited to open this myself and was almost immediately dissapointed. The selection was a bit off I think and included candy you can get in the bulk candy section of the supermarket. This candy was mostly as hard as a rock and stale. There were cough (throat) drops from the smith brothers. Throat drops are not my idea of candy."
2,Some of the candy is stale...,"Ordered this package along with some other 'decades' selection. The diversity wasn't bad, but I found a lot of the candy to be stale - as if it was the actual candy from that era, sitting in some candy vault for all these years. The candy that was supposed to be chewy was hard, and some selections (Bit O' Honey, Abbazabba, Turkish Taffy, etc...) had obviously been kept in a hot, humid area because they had melted and hardened into odd unappealing shapes. The hard candy (that was supposed to be hard) was mostly fine. Interesting, but I wouldn't order again."
4,Great product,I bought this as a Christmas present for my grandpa. It arrived very quickly and in great shape. There was a lot of candy in the box and my grandpa loved it. My only complaint is there was too much paper filler in the box. It was really annoying to dig through it to get to the candy.
5,A big hit!,"This item was my parent's Easter Basket this year. They oohhed and aahhed over every selection in the box. It was a huge hit! I highly recommend this, the candy is great and so is the walk down memory lane."
3,Caaaaaannnnndyyy,Bought this for my mother for mothers day she loved it. Told me it Told me it brought back many of memories. Great product if you like old school candy anyway.
3,Tastes like its been stored since the 40's !,"Recieved this as a gift and was very excited to open it up...that is, until i started to eat it. The packaging was satisfying, the box was perfectly intact and very adorable. I poured out the contents before eating any to see the quantity, and I have to say it's not worth the money. Not a lot of candy, literally about only 30 pieces like they say, most of them being small taffy. There's only about one piece of candy mentioned each. Every piece of candy was stale to the point where my jaw hurt to chew, some even crumbled when i tried to bite them! The quality would make you think someone stored this candy in their freezers since the 1940's then tried to sell them. Maybe the other years are better, I don't know, but this one was not worth a penny of that price. It's a cute nostalgic product to have on display for conversation and decoration, not for actual eating, the quality is that of an antique. Don't waste your money, look on to the other years."
2,Disappointment,"I was really looking forward to sharing some of these ""old time"" treats, I had as a child, with my family. Some of the most desired items listed were not in the box, like A&W, Target Sticks, Bit O-Honey, etc. Even so, there was a decent variety. Sadly, most of the items were stale, flavorless, or too chewy. What was supposed to be a fun walk down memory lane, was just a disappointment. I gave two stars because the hard candy was acceptable and the wrappers were nostalgic, but I cannot recommend this item."
3,Doesn't worth,"Things that annoyed me the most:The ""F-Lock"" key is OFF by defaultwhen this is off, you can't use your regular Function keys (F's)(example, if your system requires you to press F2 to enter BIOS setup, you have to press FLock key and then press F2 within a few seconds before you miss the opportunity.keys: Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, Del, Ins are arranged unconventionally, this can throw you off when you're used to other keyboards."
3,Good and bad!,"This is a good keyboard, but the disc that came with it was defective. I have this same keyboard at work. The seller has agreed to accept a return though!"
1,worst wrist rest,"the wrist rest combined with the height makes this easily a really bad keyboard, i know they are probably trying to make you type healthy, but you want to type period comfortbale, people with small hands will hate this keyboard. I suggest you dont buy this, they wrist rest is hard any ways not even padded, its really overall very uncomftable and useless. I wan tto take out my saw and cut it off but i think ill do the 30 days and send it back to microsoft for a full refund."
3,M$ Monopolgy Act IV,"As a keyboard I found it fairly easy to use; however it really disturbs me how M$ uses every other product to bind the used into another product. IE is mandatory with M$ Office. This Keyboard makes you naturally a M$ Office user, etc.I use Linux...totally M$-free and this keyboard makes ZERO sense as it seems totally ludicrous.Still, if you've bought into the M$ doctrine, it's a good keyboard to facilitate M$ Office."
3,average keyboard,"Overall Nice keyboard. I bought it to use at home with my laptop. Easy to plug in since it is a USB keyboard, but it has few problems.Problems: The num lock turns off and pisses me off. The F-lock is another hassle since I cannot use the F keys when its turned off. Also, the end , home and page up & down keys are placed in a wierd way. I always hit the wrong keys.Good things: The cut, copy paste buttons are great. If they were on the right side (since I am right handed) it would have been perfect. The scroller is also nice sometimes. The open application changing (alt-tab) shortcut is very convenient. I still haven't used it that much because I am used to changing applications the hard way, but this feature can be quite helpful. The = sign and parenthesis for excel are also helpful. I haven't gotten to use the top buttons that much. Basically, this keyboard tries to substitute a mouses work."
5,Great case,This case does everything it purports to do. The raised round perimeter facilitates in using the wheel in the dark. An additional benefit is that it fits the Apple Hi-Fi unit without having to take the case off. All you have to do is remove the plastic adaptive base on the Hi-Fi. Highly recommended.
1,Will not fit Ipod 160,"I purchased this for my Ipod classic 160 only to find the case is too thin to allow attachment of the cover. It is a substantial case, just not big enough."
4,Great Product!,"This is a great case. Note: The box contained 1 face plate, and 2 bottom case pieces (one for 30G the other for the 80G). I have had no problems with the case other than the headphone port. Yes, the port is great for headphones, but it will not fit my audio splitter, video out, or other 3.5mm cables. So...I had to shave a little bit of rubber off of the cables, no big deal. The click wheel protector is very responsive, and the protective plastic over the screen and the rest of the case is also strong. This is a great buy."
5,Best case ever,"This case is awesome, all my friends want one, because you can search the songs more freely than the other ones like ISkin and stuff. 0 problems"
4,Nice Case But Be Aware of Certain Things,"It doesn't look like much, but it looks great and protects my 160 GB iPod Classic perfectly. Be aware of the following:a) Despite the product description, it cannot use an iTrip transmitter that attaches from the bottom. It just doesn't snap in all the way. You would need to also buy an iPod dock extender (SendStation makes one).b) Headphone jack is exposed, but certain headphones plugs may not work because they cannot seat properly.c) No clip. I had to buy a second case to use it at the gym.d) Case backing is smooth plastic, so it will slide across your dashboard."
1,It's movements are very slow,"This product of Microsoft I bought as a ""Last Technology"" and I guess that it will be the best. But it works very slow; motions of the pointer are very slow.It's not only slow but also very heavy because of the two batteries on it.Also it's mass is vey big; i.e. it's not designed for a poeple with normal and small hand size.It doesn't satisfied my needs. In this case I think that my old mouse will be the best technology for me now, and also I'm sad for the money I gave for this product.I hope Microsoft will imporve this great idea with tecnology better."
1,Extremely poor power management,This mouse manages battery power consumption rather poorly. It cost me a fortune to constantly replacing batteries. It could hardly last for a week on regular battery and could barely last a day or two when I use rechargeable ones. This mouse definitely does not fit for gaming purpose.
2,Not for gaming.,The wireless feature is nice but this mouse is a diasppointment. I bought this mouse thinking it would improve Unreal Tournament gameplay but there was no improvement in smoothness or precision. It was worse than logitech ball mouse I already had. I'm returning it to try a new Logitech mouse.
2,"Comfortable to use, but horrible movement","Well, this mouse is supposed to have everything that I need, wireless, optical, comfortable shape. With a very good experience of the earlier microsoft optical mouse, I was really looking forward to this one.But, that's as far as you can get. It IS very comfortable on the hand, and the extra buttons sure is a big plus. But the tracking of the mouse movement sucks!!! I had to move back to my old Dell mouse because I just cannot stand it. It is always 10 pixel away from where I think it should be and I have to adjust it. And when you move the mouse in a small distance (which is what I have to do when it doesn't move right at the first time), it just becomes sluggish and unpredicatable (meaning that it has a mind of its own regarding if it will move this time). Being a programmer and a big first-person-shooter gamer, this mouse is just a waste of my time and my money.But the other wired optical mouse with extra buttons on each side is a definitely getter."
2,my complaints,Too heavy. Consumes lots of power. Shape is not comfortable. The pain of moving a brick across my mouse pad outweights the benefit of freedom from the connecting wire.
1,JUNK,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE!!! Besides requiring new batteries in less then a month it stopped working in just over a month. Just out of the return Amazon's period!!!
1,i hate this mouse,this mouse goes through a new set of batteries every 3 or 4 days. it starts jumping and stalling when batteries get weak. it feels extremely unresponsive - huge lag time. don't buy this mouse.. i'm looking for a new mouse right now.. i never written a review before. but i feel strongly enough about this to write one.
3,Battery Eater,"While this is a great mouse, smooth motion, it EATS though batteries like they are chocolate.Fits nicely in my hand, and I work LONG hours. Okay that's prob why it eats batteries. I'm using the mouse on average 9 hours a day most days it's more like 12+ ...."
1,"Nice, but... if you are a gamer don't buy it!!!","I'm a 28 years old gamer, you could say that I play around 3 to 5 hours a week, normally a mouse last me around 1 year (and normally is dust the cause why I change mouse), This mouse begin to malfunction after 2 months.For showdown is very nice, very impressive, very comfort, etc, is all but a 6-dollar mouse, last more than this. I'm sad since I even buy some recharged batteries for this mouse hopping that will last a lot of time.If you don't play maybe this mouse is for you...you will impress your friends..."
1,Save Your Money,I bought one of these and it doesn't work for beans. It is worthless. Save your money.
2,"Jerky, Hysterisis, Heavy. BAD for detail work.","With both the Logitech and Microsoft side by side, I find myself switching between the two to protect my wrists. This mouse works, but NOT for detail work. Here's why:(1) It's heavy. (2) It's sticky...microsoft uses cheaper slide-pads compared to logitech (3) the stickiness makes it nearly impossible to nudge over a pixel (4) It is slow to wake up from it's snooze state (which it enters very very quickly) and typically jumps 10 pixels when it does wake up.On the good side: (*) It's bigger and fits in my large hands better than the Logitech devices. (*) The batteries appear to last a little longer.I use my computer mouse constantly (3D design work) and find it frustrating to use this mouse for fine positioning. I would never purchase it again. I only gave it 2 stars because it meets it's specs."
1,This mouse stinks,I got this mouse several months ago for Xmas. It seemed great at first but it irritates the heck out of me now. It goes through a pair of AA's every month but the most frustrating thing is the lag. To conserve power it shuts down between movements. So you have to move the mouse before it registers a move. This causes it to be jerky as it shuts down easily. It's laying useless on my desk now. I hooked up the logitech that came with my laptop and I am much happier now.
2,Not for Gamers,"Just try and play Q3 or some other FPS type game with this mouse..AHH! I have an oak desk and this thing follows the grain in the wood, [poopy] mousepads are the reason I got this thing. The wired version of this mouse was super but this one eats batteries and is too jerky for accurate mousing. If you have a very smooth desktop with no characteristics in it then you might find this product useful, otherwise look at the new Logitech version with a higher dpi, I've not tried it but I've read great reviews about it."
2,Not for me,"I love the shape of the mouse and the fact that it's wireless. BUT! the moment I started to use it, I noticed the sluggishness with this mouse. Too bad, I was going to fall in love with this mouse, but I can't stand the sluggishness as I do heavy work with computers. I do programming, so I need real quick response like wired Intelli Mouse Explorer. I'm going to back to it right now..."
2,OK,"Whenever I don't move my mouse for a few seconds, it suddenly moves to the corner of the screen, and I didn't even move the mouse. Also, the mouse is big, and not really good for a laptop user or an avid gamer, as I found out from personal experiences."
1,Agree on the batteries -- high replacement cost,Mouse works great until suddenly it seems like your computer is acting up. It isn't -- your mouse needs batteries.I have 2 Logitech wireless mice and I replace the batteries on those every three or four months. I cannot go more than 2 weeks on this mouse before the batteries give out. With the Logitech the problem is clear -- the mouse quits working. The Microsft Mouse tries to keep working but can't. Not working at all is better. The first time with the Microsoft Mouse I was rebooting my machine and trying to find out why the computer was acting flaky. Replaced the batteries and ... problem fixed.
2,Great feel but bad mouse,"I guess I'm a gluten for punishment but this is the 2nd of these that I've gone through now. It couldn't be designed to fit your hand any better, at least mine, but the problems are in the electronics on the inside. It's hard to wake up, sticks to everything but the most glossy smooth surfaces, and seems to go through batterys like a digital camera. The problem is with the batterys, maybe this is just rechargables but on both units, with just normal use the batterys have exploded inside the mouse and ruined the electronics inside. The second time I was using the mouse when it popped and fryed itself.I don't recommend this mouse as much as I love how it fits my hand...it needs to work longer than a few months, especially for the price."
1,Great! When it actualy works.,"I bought this because I loved optical mice. But after about 6 months I began to have transmission problems and it kept freezing up for a few seconds at a time. Then minutes, then froze up for good.I should of know that a microsoft product wouldnt last long. Right out of the box I could tell. Very cheap feel to it. Good thing I kept my old mouse.Im sticking with Logitech. They make much more reliable mice and I never had a problem with them. So avoid this microsoft one and stick with logitech."
2,cool but not that fantastic,"I have been using this mouse for 2 month now, I start to NOT liking it. It's heavy, the position for the fingers is not very comfortable (my right hand even feels pain), my shoulder feels weird too, and the mouse drains battery BIG TIME!!!. Since I am using it on a Mac, and I turned off the Microsoft Mouse control, I don't get so much of those jerky movement PC users had experienced. But still, I'd rather go with the ones got a cord on, they are lighter, smaller and more accurate."
4,Great shape but technology not for everyone,"I've been using this mouse for a couple of days. I have also used the Logitech Cordless Mouseman Optical. The great thing about the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer is the shape -- absolutely perfect for my hand. Very comfortable and buttons are positioned well. And the feel of the buttons and wheel, after getting used to them, is great.But the problem is Microsoft's battery saving technology that shuts off the mouse when it detects no hand on the mouse. But this technology isn't perfect. Very often, if I scroll the wheel without moving the mouse, it won't respond because it doesn't detect my hand. So I have to shake the mouse a little bit so it ""wakes up."" Not a huge deal, but often a bit annoying.For me, I think I'll go back to a corded version."
1,Buy This Mouse If You Own Stock In A Battery Company,"Great ergonomics, great functionality, fits my hand like a glove. BUT...I have had it for 5 weeks and just replaced my 3rd set of batteries. I DO NOT leave my computer on all of the time. It is shut down when not being used. This is a serious DESIGN FLAW and MS should know better. The person in the office next to mine uses a Logitech Cordless (I got the MS one because it fit my hand better...it is a little bigger) and he still hasn't had to change his batteries after almost six months. I WOULD NOT BUY this product again. Learn from the experience of others and do the same."
1,not worth it !!!,"don't be fooled by it's cool looking, it's not worth the money. this product is definitely not for someone like me who are used to fast and accurate cursor moving speed, you will lose your patient and eventually MURDER the mouse. i knew i bought the wrong product after i used it for only about 10 minutes."
4,A long awaited first attempt by Microsoft,"This mouse was a long awaited attempt by Microsoft to incorporate the best of wireless freedom with laser eye technology. Microsoft has succeeded in many ways, but not without a few flaws. I bought this mouse about 6 months ago, it has been working as expected, but with poor battery life. On average use, the batteries will hold for about a week. The price also hurts, but given the brandname this is expected. Promising technology, but needs some work. Not Bad."
3,Good - but there's a problem,"The mouse works well: up to at least 2 metres away from the receiver, which could be useful when doing presentations etc. However, I bought it for use with an Hewlett Packard Pavilion, and it will only work if you plug it in after booting up the machine. If you try to boot up when the mouse is plugged in you won't be able to, the machine will hang.This situation is true on the following machines:-> Hewlett Packard Pavilion Model 9790, 9780C, 9770, 9895, 9686C, 9694C, 9600, 8770c, 8765C, 8660c, 8705C, 8700, 7205C, 7905, 7850, XE738, XL768, XP788, XP789, and XT938 personal computers.-> Compaq Presario 5900Z, 7940 series personal computers.-> IBM Aptiva 2198-84U.What a pity I wasn't told this before buying.P.S. does anyone want an 'almost' new Intellimouse Explorer?"
4,I wish MS still made mouses this size.,"I've had much better battery life that what others are reporting and my PC is on 24 hrs a day. I usually get close to 3 weeks on rechargeables.The one great thing I about this mouse is the size. Most are so small you have to crimp your hand into a small ball to grab the thing. Not so with this mouse where you can comfortably rest your hand without constantly squeezing your hand in half. Much more comfortable for those of us who spend a long time in front of our PCs.(... and since I'm sure someone's going to comment, yes ""Mouses"" is the apt plural term for computer mouse.)"
4,It does make noise,I just set up my mouse and I hear a high pitched noise but I dont think it is the RF. I think it has something to do with the light used to detect motion. Whenever I move the mouse the light lights up and I hear the high pitched noise. I dont actually think that the noise is a big enough problem to not buy the mouse though. I think it is by far the most comfortable mouse to use and is all around awsome and high tech feeling. I like it and am going to learn to ignore the noise. Go buy it now.
4,VERY GOOD MOUSE !!,"Well, I think that the word that describes this mouse is:CONFORT !!In all the mouses that have passed throught my life, this is the most confortable !!! beleiveme, and well, the first wireless, so I cannot tell you much about that, but what I can, is that it works great if you're not a gamer or a graphic designer, because the mouse tends to sleep when it's not in use to save battery life..., so if it's sleep and you move it just a little bit (like when you're a sniper and need little movements to put that bullet in your opponent's head, or when you need to move a line just a little bit in a CAD) the mouse wont wake up, you will have to make a notorious move to make it respond....But if you use your computer for daily work (office, home, presentations) this is the right mouse for you."
2,Get Rechargable Batteries,"On Windows XP at least, my system tells me I have 1 week of battery time left, and then within 15 minutes, I get a 3 day warning. After that, you have less than 5 minutes to change batteries. After I got 2 pairs of rechargable batteries (one to charge while the other is in use) it wasn't as annoying, but still you only get about 1 week out of the batteries, which still is unacceptable if you ask me.I liked the feel of my silver (wired) Microsoft mouse with the red glow on the bottom (I think it is called Explorer mouse), but the wire on those and the Optical mouse both got shorted out <6 months of use, causing the mouse to get disconnected/connected repeatly while trying to use it-majorly annoying."
3,okay product,"the clips are a bit flimsy, i expected them to be a bit more sturdy. they still do the job though"
4,Misao stars in this volume,"This volume (6 of 8) ends with a touching story about Misao. Can their friendship survive once Sasami figures out what is going on? See how the perfect kids resolves this crisis.Pretty Sammy fanatics know that 4 different instances of this series exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Next came the OVA, and finally this Magical Project S TV series.Pretty Sammy is so cute, you might just eventually want to see all of these. ^_^"
4,"Good, but not quite what I expected...","If you haven't already noticed, the picture of this cable is very vague, and only shows the ends on the cable. When I ordered, I expected to receive a cable with a straight cord, but instead I got a perfectly functioning cable that has a coiled cord, like a telephone cord. I do not mind this at all, and in fact it is rather convenient because the cord does not easily tangle and can still be stretched to far distances away from your amp. So, just a heads up before you buy, but I still think that it is definitely worth the low price. All the other high-quality Monster cables are around $12."
2,Very Noisy,"I got this cable because i my guitar rig contains a lot of wires and cords and i thought that the cable will make my rig look just a little more neat and wouldn't tangle with the other cords. It came in just in time, and it looked pretty cool and it didnt seem like anything was wrong with itFirst thing i noticed when I plugged it into an effect pedal was that it didn't securely plug in. It kept popping out somehow. When I turned on my amp it generates a very distinctive hum... I thought that maybe one of my pedals were defective, but when I switched out the cable, the hum went away.When you plug in the cable from guitar straight into an amp, it does its job. but if you have a lot of effects on your guitar rig, this cable will make your amp hum."
5,Great price and product,for the price you can not beat it. the item was shipped quickly and it was exactly what was advertised
4,They're OK,"I ordered three. One has a hard time fitting into some jacks. I'm not sure why. But the cables are quiet, no hum or buzz, and the coils keep the tangles under control. A good budget cable."
4,Cheap and works,"While this is no Monster cable, it suits a beginner like me fine. It is coiled as the headline states (don't just go by the picture...read). This is a cheapie as it is encased in shiny plastic which will eventually show wear and may crack with heavy usage. All in all, it will work fine until I get a more quality product...providing my playing warrants it."
3,What you see is what you get.,Product sent quickly as advertised and pictured. I have used this item many times for a variety of uses and it works.
1,terrible picture,the photo of the item is unclear. i thought i ordered a strait cord. this is a coiled cord. the seller should use a photo that represent the real item rather than show the ends of the wire only. it seems this was done on purpose.
4,"Shame ""Complete"" does not really mean Complete","Being able to watch again and again your favorite tv show is priceless... however, it is a little bit annoying some scenes have been cut out. Maybe casual audience will not notice the missing scenes, but true little house fans will do (which I think it is them who would actually purchase the DVD on the first place)."
1,disc 1 did not work,"Very frustrated... disc 1 does not work in 3 players that we have. Sadly, we did not know this b/c is was a gift that was not opened within the 30 day return/replace period. Visible scratches are on back of disc...dissappointed..."
4,DVD Quality,"This series never disappoints and is perfect family viewing. The screen quality of Series 6 is a little disappointing. The night scenes are on the dark side and it is difficult to make out images. This aside, it contains excellent stories."
5,Far and away the best season,"These are the best episodes ever! We get to see a more mature laura and I think that is wonderful. Almanzo's entrance as a main character gives the show the romantic element it needed, besides Mary's husband, of course. I truly think we witnessed so much change with thise season."
5,Best season yet,"My whole family loved it. We laughed hard and we cried hard. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it doesn't mention it on the box this is the season that Nellie finds true love, Laura grows up and everything changes. I don't know if the rest are as good as this one but this one is definitely my favorite. I've already preordered the next one. I enjoyed this as a kid and my kids enjoy it very much too. My boys enjoy the more action packed episodes of course and there are plenty of them. I would recommend this and the other 5 seasons of this great show."
4,The Wait is Over,"I have been waiting for this season to come out and I am so happy that it finally has. My rating is not because of the show but because of the quality of the dvds, they were better than 1-5 but they still had some problems with picture and sound nothing major though. There were interviews with Dean Butler, Alison Arngrim, and Dabs Greer, they were pretty informative and it was nice to have some extras. There was also commentary from Alison Arngrim on Back to School Part 2. Overall I was not disappointed and it was worth the wait I can't wait for Season 7 to come out on February 15, 2005."
3,Missing Disc in order,"We gladly received this set of discs while living overseas, and our kids slowly worked their way through the discs, but when they got to Disc 3, they discovered it was a disc from Season 1... we quickly checked our Season 1 box, but found the disc already there. Now we have 2 Season 1, Disc 6, but no Season 6 Disc 3, and we are unable to even contact anyone from here to try to at least get a free download, or something. Everything is so electronically formatted, and the return date has expired."
4,CUT!,"I have waited SOOO long for this season to come out. It is the best season with my absolute all time favorite episode, ""Sweet Sixteen."" I can still remember watching that episode for the first time. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was that this episode is edited from its original airing. There are three scenes missing, they are small, but key! The one where Laura buys her shoes (with heels to make her look taller and older) and the one where she is determined to learn to walk in them! This is important because not too long after that we realize that it worked! Almonzo takes notice of her and she looks down at her shoes and tucks them uderneath her. I was really hoping that when the DVDs were released they would show the COMPLETE episodes and not the ""edited for TBS"" versions. I'm bummed."
1,"Great show, terrible quality","The show is great, I have all the other seasons as well, but the quality of this DVD collection is again horrific. The audio is sometimes mangled, like a worn out VHS tape. The video is not much better. I do no understand this since the DVD states that they used state of the art technology to clean up/enhacing the originals. It looks like they have taken the cut-up TV tape versions and slammed them on a DVD. Certainly not collectors item quality. I'd rather pay a few bucks more for a better, much better, quality."
3,Why did they cut scenes out when this is a DVD collection!,"I was anxious to buy Season 6's DVD collection because one of the best Little House episodes EVER is ""Sweet Sixteen."" After it originally aired on NBC they cut out IMPORTANT scenes from this episode to make room for more commercials in syndication. During ""Sweet Sixteen"" after Almanzo FINALLY notices Laura in a new light, Laura looks down at her shoes under the buckboard seat and smiles knowing her new heels have made her look older finally. If you didn't see the original on NBC in 1979 though, this scene doesn't make ANY sense! I am so IRATE that they cut out the scenes of Laura buying high-heeled shoes AFTER Almanzo initially ignores her new grown up look. They also cut out Laura trying to learn to walk in them. Why on earth did they delete these scenes from the DVD when there are no commercials? Shame on them! Also the guy who interviews ""Almanzo"" and ""Nellie"" is CREEPY!!!!!"
5,Little House - Season 6,"I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I have not watched them, but did enjoy the originals when they were on TV. She loves the whole series."
3,Gift,I got this as a Christmas gift from my sister. Twice it didn't work properly. I had to get is somewhere else.
5,love my new PC,"I ordered my new PC and it arrived within the week. I was thrilled. The set up with the directions you gave me were simple- I could do it without asking anyone for help.Each feature has been so easy to master. I now use my digital camera card in the slot on the PC to upload my photos- no more cords to worry about. I made a file of photos and used the DVD burner to burn a file for safe keeping. Simple, fast, and I love it!And I watched some movies on it too.. really great!I'm pleased with my selection and very pleased with Amazon's shipping."
3,Good When It Works,"The first one that I received worked well for only a short time. It was damaged in transit, and the damage caused video display problems and the hard drive to crash. I now have a replacement, and it seems to be fine."
3,hohum HTPC configuration,"I initially thought that this was a pretty decent deal for a HTPC but when I dug into it further, I changed my mind. For starters,1. the ram is 533, not 800mhz2. you burn 2 ram slots for 2 512mb sticks so an upgrade means you throw away the 2 512mb sticks3. the power supply is only 300w4. no dvi output to support a digital lcd display5. no video out to push to a projector or flat panel widescreenNot much of a HTPC (home theater pc) when you get down to it. HP missed the boat here. I would have strongly considered it but when I have to spend an additional $100-$200 on a separate video card to support a digital lcd display and display-out capabilities and upgrade the powersupply to support the new graphics card the price becomes too high."
2,HP M8120N,"After spending an hour following HP startup instructions, was unable to get the TV media card to function properly. I called HP support and was on for over 2 hours with a tech which ended in having to do a system recovery. The problem is not fully solved, but I didn't want to waist anymore time on it.The software package is not that great, but you do get to put up with preloaded advertising garbage that wants you to pay for the software that should have been on there in the first place. After removing most of the HP software, the machine is much faster. Is there anything special about this machine, NOT REALLY!Next, we will see if the rebates come through."
1,Windows Nightmare not Vista,I cannot beleive it but the Apple commercials are 100% correct. I have never had a computer virus until I had this thing for three weeks. So I perform a system restore. Now Vista denies my access to my personal files telling me I am not the administrator. I got this fixed but now it is blocking my Microsoft Office programs.Vista tries to be too smart. Not a good operating system. I wish I had this pc with Windows XP. HP support provides about 90% of the steps to fix the problems. Unfortunatley it is that last 10% that gives you fits.Also HP loads the computer up with a bunch of junk programs that do the basics. If you want to write a decent looking write scribe label you will need to pay the $50 an upgrade the Roxio program to the full feature version.
1,I Hate Everything about this computer,"Worse piece of junk I've ever wasted my money on.The keyboard is cheap ... duplicates letters and skips keystrokes.God help you if you don't spellcheck EVERY single thing you type!Their tech support is awful! Very, very BAD!!Having Vista is no help either.An awful combination."
3,"Loud, not as fast as I expected","I usually buy a new desktop every 2 to 3 years. This time I waited 5 years from the last one, and was expecting a dramatic improvement in speed and OS interface as usual. It boots up and shuts down about twice as fast, but I haven't even loaded this up with software yet. Vista is a pretty interface and full of features, but cumbersome to use. The effect of windows fading in and out feels slow. I may just need to some to get used to it.The whirring of the fans and grinding of the hard drive are loud and annoying. I keep this in the bedroom and leave it on sometimes at night, so this is a bummer. My 5-year old Dell is much quieter. Other owners on this site and others have commented that this model is quiet. Huh???Did I get a bad one? Or is this relatively quiet compared to other high end systems? How about the loud grinding hard drive sound? BTW, my other int and ext HD's don't make this sound, except for one ext one, but it's still pretty quiet. Any comments?"
1,Too many problems,"I've had 3 failures, all different. First was bad Wi-Fi, next a hard drive, next a ""Windows has detected a problem"" and computer would no longer start. Only good experience has been the fantastic customer service provide by Amazon in dealing with this series of problems."
5,Great platform to start from,"Very cool PC.I bought it for the sole intention of watching tv,surfing the web and the use of some software.For the money you really can't go wrong.Right out of the box it is ready for watching tv.The only downfall is if you are going to use a large screen like I have(46""lcd).I upgraded my video card to a higher resolution one and with blu-ray playback capability because I will be adding blu-ray to the system.I can't honestly put that as a complaint toward the system though because you simply cannot build this computer for what they sell it for.Tremendous value and its prety hard to get this one to stutter because its fast.If you are a blu-ray/hd enthusiast I'd recommend a few upgrades.Overall for the money you just can't go wrong."
4,"OK machine, but no wireless keyboard/mouse, no DVI output","We bought this one to replace the A6130N that was defective (dead hard disk) right after out the box. From the reviews, it looks like that it has wireless mouse/keyboard, which is nice. When it arrives, however, both keyboard and mouse are normal wired. Also, there is no DVI output, only VGA, which makes my W2007 monitor a little too good. The TV tuner works fine, bu the windows media center can not detect the tuner somehow, so we have to use the native WinTV to watch over the air HDTV programs. Obviously the processing speed is not so fast for this lower end Pc, as there is always a lag of picture compared with sound in the TV. If you use larger screen format, you can see freezing and jump on the pictures. Overall, it is a good computer."
3,Great Features But.....,"I had the problem that everyone else seems to have regarding the wireless card. Had to go online to find the solution which required opening up the computer, disconnecting one wire on the network card and reattaching it at another point. That solved my wireless signal strength issues but repeatedly this computer can't connect to an unrestricted wireless router located across the room. It is very frustrating. Also has some Vista quirks. 3 Stars."
2,Kind of sucks,"For as much horsepower as the specs say this system should have, it seems slower than it should be (biggest PC I've ever had, but not the fastest, even for a 'clean' PC).The system failed to complete it's factory set-up (the wizard that launches after you turn the machine on for the first time) - it hung after a while.Finally, the second time that I tried to power the machine on, nothing would happen - no fans, no nothing) - re-seating all the plugs seems to solve it, but didn't leave a good feeling. A friend of mines actuall had to have the power supply replaced in the first 10 days.Last, Windows Media Center TV program manager doesn't work with my cable company, so a lot of the TV features don't work well (or at all). I can watch TV, but many of the features don't work"
2,Apparently like fine wine...,"I read this book (or at least the first five chapters) for a class in my Graduate program. For me, Palmer is just way too wordy. Most of those in my class agree that the points made by Palmer are valid, but also agree that he simply used too many words.My professor said that I should keep the book. He said that after several years of teaching, I will pull this book off my shelf and it will really speak to me.We'll see..."
3,"Insightful, but hard to read.",I am a college student majoring in education. I read this book as part of an assignment. When I first started to read this book I didn't really get much out of it. I found it very hard to read. It is the type of book you have to have total peace and quit to read. Once I got into the book I was able to understand it a little better. I found quit a bit of good information. The book is especially good for high-school or college educators.
3,A challenge to read,"The book has a lot of interesting ideas, but is a challenge to read for non-mothertongue speakers."
2,This book was extremely hard to follow.,"I am an education major at Macon State College in Macon, GA and I found this book to be very hard to follow and extremely redundant. I had to read every paragraph at least twice to even half way understand what I was reading. I believe the book would be much better for an experienced teacher to read than a student. It was very insightful and had a few good ideas, but other than that, I was disappointed with the book as a whole."
1,terrible seller!,I basically ordered the book and never heard back from the seller that Amazon represented and still have not received a credit from Amazon for the book I never received!
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,"I read this book with a group of teachers as part of our book club. I had high hopes that it would provide some great discussion. After the first few chapters nobody liked it. Out of the 8 of us that read it, not one of us actually enjoyed the book. There were some good points, but too philisophical for our taste."
4,Necessary,Palmer's writing evokes the inner being. He offers a lot of humility and personal experience which calls a person to respond from the inside. I was stirred in numerous ways by his writing and applaud this one like I applaud many of his books. Its a necessary additon to the library of anyone serious about their teaching or in the business of teacher training.
2,Pop Psyche meets Education,"I wanted to like this book as it had been recommended by a friend, but I couldn't do it. Nothing pulled me through the book at all. Maybe it's because I'm not discouraged as a teacher, but I was only able to find bits and pieces that worked for me. That and the book seemed riddled with pop-psych terminology which turned me off. I ask only of a writer that he or she write well and have a passion. Palmer is passionate, but the book is not well written. If teachers are looking for the courage to teach, they should find one of James Herndon's books (two of which are recently back in print) or read Kozol's _Savage Inequalities_ or any one of Ted Sizer's books. I applaud Palmer's intentions, but the end result is lacking."
4,Must Read for all Professionals!,"This is a must read for all professionals! The subject that Palmer covers is rarely given the space to develop. Yet, as he so clearly illustrates, it is a subject at the 'heart' of our professional development. If you are questioning your 'calling' or feeling discouraged in the fight, grab a copy of this book and become re-couraged! I would be very interested to read more on this subject and wonder if more thought should be given to teaching this as a subject at university level. We have plently of the how, what, why and when, but very little of the who!"
5,Parker Palmer is my new role model.,"Courage to Teach is inspiring without being trite; refreshing, insightful and easy to read. It's the first non-fiction book I've read in years that has kept me up late at night turning pages. I read on the subway, and people banging into me couldn't distract me from this book by my new role model, Parker Palmer. The book combines insightful observations about the intersection of education and human nature with practical anecdotes that suggest new strategies for one's own teaching repertoire. Any educators who care about integrity and sense of self should find a few hours for Parker Palmer."
3,Difficult... yet valuable,"In order to comprehend what Palmer is trying to get across,I had to read this book twice. I read many parts several times before I could move on to the next section. I found some of it fascinating, especially some of the stories that he refers to. I had a hard time getting into the book at first. If it weren't for this project, I would not have chosen this book off of the shelf. I might use some of his ideas in my teaching career (parts that were not over my head)."
4,On the right path,"Though I had to change some of Palmer's more spiritualistic language to fit my own agnostic vocabulary, I found this an inspiring book with a pertinent message."
2,Gets better as it goes....?,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm a university teacher who cares deeply about teaching, which I guess must be why this book was recommended to me in the first place. The early chapters I found simply intolerable, heavily reliant on unexamined truistic claptrap about self-knowledge, the soul, etc, etc. The whole book is overwritten and florid, like the inside of a greetings card. It is hard to be genuinely profound in that sort of prose, and I wished that Parker, who is clearly a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, had had the courage to write in something approximating the language of normal speech.I said the book gets better as it goes: the chapter on subject-centered learning is absolutely first-rate, if you make it that far."
2,"overwrought, overrated","Some of Palmer's points were pretty good (the subject centered classroom and critical moments in teaching), however it was overwritten to the point of sheer unreadability and most of his ideas can be had elsewhere. The book would have been far better had he dropped his grandiose writing style; it just felt like he had written the book to impress all of us with how much florid, useless prose he could manage to shove in.In all, it was okay, but there was no need for such simple ideas to be presented in such a pretentious manner."
5,The cost of caring,"I've been teaching 9 years and had begun to think the toll was just too great. If you invest your emotional energy into your students, you are at risk for some very personal feelings of rejection.... and it can come from parents and administrators, as well as the students. This book probably saved me from quitting or self-destructing. Because Palmer so squarely defines this risk and compassionately encourages his reader (we're all teachers in some respect) with explanation and appreciation, it allows the teacher to once again feel that he/she is making the sacrifice for a worthy and noble cause. I loved this book."
4,Never had a problem,"Hi people. I bought this monitor USED 6 months ago from a friend. Before that, he had used it for for 2 years. He and I both never had any problem with it. We never encountered that annoying loud sound that other users described. I realize this is quite stupid being that my review is posted today in 2006 when nobody around even uses CRT anymore. But just my 2 cents for those who are buying used monitors or something. Cheers"
3,"Great monitor, so-so TV","The speakers are the worst thing about this unit. hooking up my computer thru them results in very annoying beeps and pops. Sound thru the normal TV or cable input is fine and sound output from my computer to other speakers is fine, so it is clearly the SyncMaster's problem. The monitor itself is fantastic as a monitor, but I could have had the same quality of monitor and a tv tuner card for my Mac and been happier. Live and learn."
5,"Nice, affordable collectible for a Voyager fan.","I love this Janeway figure!She has articulated limbs and her head turns. The face is nicely sculpted so it really looks like Kate Mulgrew. Her (plastic) hair is in a low ponytail.The outfit is not of the highest quality (it closes with a large strip of Velcro in the back) but it's not easy to reproduce realistic cloth outfits for toys, and for the most part it looks fine. Both her comm badge and her rank pips are accounted for.She comes with a few accessories including a tricorder, and stands nicely on a base in the shape of the Voyager comm badge."
2,A Ruling Passion,"I am a huge fan of Judith Michael. This husband/wife team has brought a great deal of style, mystery, romance and intrigue to the genre which I appreciate and eagerly await...most of the time! With A Ruling Passion, however, I am terribly dissapointed. It had the great ""long book"" look I love (which usually means wonderful depth and detail) but is completely disappointing from the start. I kept reading, thinking..surely it would get to their usual style...but, alas, no. This is a wholely disappointing novel. The characters lack depth, the plot is thin and the devlopment is vague and repetitive with one boring scenario emphasizing the same facet of character or plot over and over and over. I surely hope the dynamic team of Judith Michael will be back up to speed soon! I need summer reading!"
4,"You can't put this book down, you gotta keep reading.","Since the first page this book makes it very interesting, at about the first pages you want to keep reading more. You can't put this book down, you gotta keep reading. The characters each are very different, yet, they are the same in some ways. Sometimes it makes you want to be like them."
4,Great makeover on my old sofa,"I have an old leather sofa for a long time and it has shown ages. Since it is a pretty standard sofa, I found this slipcover on Amazon which costs less than Sure Fit website plus FREE SHIPPING! When I received the slipcover and started to put it over my old sofa, it leaves a lot extra fabric around th corner. Since the slipcover is in dark color (burdundy), people may not notice it anyway. I think it is a beautiful makeover on my old sofa and adds rich color to the whole room."
1,I don't even want to give this one star....,"This book was horrible. There was no organization to it. The author speaks of Christianity through an ecofeminist perspective. The book would have been better off just focusing on women and the environment, without the addition of her ""new age"" Christianity."
1,Horrible read.,"This book and others like it have lead to the stale intellectualism that is dominant in much of the West's theology departments today. It was, by far, the worst book I've had to read on way to getting my education. Flawed arguments abound and the writing is stereotypical of feminist writers. Lots of steam with absolutely no content.On the plus side Ivone Gebara does not come across as an angry male hating feminist so that was unique to her book."
1,bottom section too small for the average adult cat,"Unfortunately, the bottom space is way too small for the average 6 - 8 lb. cat to get into. Looks great for kittens but a cat 1 year + couldn't fit comfortably into the bottom half."
2,Not happy with this game,"This game was for my 5 year old. She gave up quickly as it is very difficult to control and even more difficult to understand the voice that tells you what you are supposed to do. She knows her numbers and was just using the level where all you have to do is shoot the number it tells you and then shoot the gems that come up. Even if you know the answer and are able to understand the voice, controlling the ship to shoot the answer is another story! I'm 29 and have had a bit of gaming experience in my life. I tried to play it several times and also had a lot of difficulty controlling the ship and understanding what was being asked of me. It would be educational if it were easier to play but it is just frustrating."
4,4stars,Kids liked it and I loved that it reinforced their math skills. I only let my children play computer learning games and Leapster games. I hate to watch my friends kids just wasting their time on kill this and that.I want more leapster learning games to help them grow with and learn. Hint I want more games like this for 2nd grade and up. Leapster Fan!
2,educational but boring,"My son never really liked this game. I bought it for the educational value but unfortunately he just never really liked it. It is too repetitive. there should be some extra animations or something when you beat the levels, it just never grabbed his attention for very long."
4,Father of a 5 year old,"I think the game is fun, but my daughter doesn't really get hooked to it. She likes it as much as Nemo or Rabbit River. Maybe if she had more time when the numbers start coming down that would help - I think sometimes she gets frustrated when not able to continue advancing through levels."
2,Mixed feelings,"The glass heart itself is nice, but the other beads on the necklace are really cheap looking - like the kind you imagine kids using in preschool. Still, some people have complimented me on it. It's cute in a ""fun"" way."
1,Terrible waste of money,"Terrible necklace. I received this product and it was terribly scratched and broke after a few days of wear. If you want a necklace, find something else."
3,Not what I expected,"The book was listed under ""German Books for Children"" but the text was in English. This was disappointing but probably my mistake in not realizing this was the case."
4,Beware one episode is missing!!!,"I do love this series, but I did feel a little disappointed when I purchased the whole box set to find out that the best episode of all, ""Jingle Balls"" was not included with this, and still has not been released on DVD outside of U.K/Europe.I guess it might be because BBC Warner don't own the rights to it, but it is a must if you purchase the ALMOST complete box set."
3,Through the eyes of Abbie Hoffman,"This is an interesting collection of articles written by Abbie when he was on the run. Needless to say, some are better than others, but all in all, it is Hoffman from many aspects. We see him as the Prankster touring the Federal Bureau if Investiongation while he is on the wanted list. He is the invisible man at a party in New York. He is the activist in fighting the dredging of the river and he is the social commentator going through the newspaper and noting how strange parts of the world have become.Some of the articles are a trip down memory lane or at least another perspective on history. Others are still relevent today. Obviously, his tips for going underground are outdated in today's world - but the commentary of the language of the the public relations of the U.S. and the translation of the news still holds today. Only the names of the leaders and countries have changed."
2,Seemed old and stale.,"After buying fresh from the local market, I wanted to give this brand a chance, due to the reviews and ""cool storage"" policy they had. But, compared to farmers market fresh, the taste is awful! Sorry, really wanted to like it, but, had to toss the can, it was so bad."
3,Not what was expected,I can't give this much of a review since it was not what I thought I would receive. I thought it was a honey product and it was not. I have no use for the product and it would not be worth the expense to return.
5,"Flavorful, Soft & Fresh","'High Desert' is high quality! It has a mellow, sweet flavor...occasionally I catch the aroma of flowers as I'm working or exercising but there are no flowers, it's the pollen working it's way through my system. This pollen disolves easily, compared to lesser quality pollen that I've tried. My body craves it and is satisfied by it. I use it together with 'Nutrex' spirulina 1 tsp. 1-3 times aday. It's pure energy nutrition! This pollen is certainly among the best for sale here, or anywhere for that matter. My only issue is that on my second order I recieved the can, not the bag...since the can is an upgrade I have zero complaints and will be reordering soon. Allow a few extra days for shipping and be aware the package is simple cardboard, no freeze-packs and this product is perishable."
4,Good and good for you!,"The right size and delicious. I use it in smoothies in the morning. The only negative is that the picture shows a jar as the container, which was attractive to me and when it arrived it is in a sealable plastic bag. No big deal, I just put it in a jar. I keep it in the freezer."
1,I used to love this printer...,"...until I discovered it doesn't work with Vista.Since every other printer I have (Samsung, Sony, Epson, Kodak) works fine in Vista (I'm in the photo biz and have a lot of printers!), I can only conclude that HP is doing something ""nonstandard"" in its driver and if it followed the rules for writing a printer driver it would have worked.If you think you may run Vista, do NOT buy this printer.HP's support web site gave me the run-around....it referred me to a page that did not include information for this device."
3,"Excellent printer, unless you're running VISTA","I have used this printer with a Presario XP computer. It has been flawless in photo printing, graphic output, and is a draft mode workhorse. I give it five stars for: durability, performance, and quality.Now you should know: HP will NOT provide a VISTA printer driver. That means you CANNOT use this printer in VISTA. I have spent over one week attempting to use various HP print drivers to no avail. I have contacted HP. Their response: HP will not support this printer in VISTA - buy a new printer.I'm taking their advice. I'm buying an EPSON."
3,HP 7150,"My HP 7150 prints nice photographs. The quality is very good, but I have had a lot of difficulty getting 4x6 sizes of paper to feed properly.Also, business letters are important to me and I can't get envelopes to feed properly.It has been frustrating not having availability of free customer service.I will probably replace this unit with an Epson in the near future."
1,Pure junk,Costco special first one didn't work and this one is the same. Save your money and pass on these come on printers
2,Stomach ache...,"I have been taking Centrum for more than a yr now. When I ran out, I bought this new formula. The new formula gives me stomach ache...dont buy...better to stick to the old formula."
1,upset stomach,"Very good source of vitamins and minerals,but in a matter of seconds will give a mean upset stomach like something boiling,and then will start burping that awful taste. I would suggest for you to buy another type of centrum pill."
1,stomach ache,"I've had to stop taking these pills after a week because whenever I take them I get a terrible stomach ache. This new formula is bad. Search for other reviews of these vitamins before you buy them, it seems that they have been giving a lot of people stomach problems. Don't buy these they are not worth it. I'm going back to GNC mega man sport."
2,centrum vitamins,"I used to take the old formula with no problems. Something about this one has me getting really sick. It took me a while to figure that it was this vitamin making me sick. After taking this tablet with food or after food, In about 15 minutes I start to feel severe pain around my chest, hardly able to breath. It happened at work and I almost called 911 and my husband, I was sure it was a heart attack. Good thing I waited and after about 1 hour I was OK. I waited a few weeks and tried it again, exact same thing happened. Now I am stuck with a huge bottle of vitamins I cannot use."
1,stomach ache,This given me stomach ache within 5 minutes of eating. Initially I thought its due to the humongous size of the tablet but even breaking it into smaller pieces didn't fix it.
5,I feel great.,"I'm 67 years old,but I'm very active with daily excercise. Centrum gives me all the boost to keep on going and going.Great stuff."
1,Stomach ache. beware!,"this stuff gives a very annoyin stomach pain, looks like it's d new formula. i wish i had read other people's reviews"
1,stomach ache.,dont take this... i had stomach aches too after taking this tablets...i read somewhere they had a coating which is difficult to digest.
4,A good story...,"Kazuki is dragged into the world of fan comics by his friend, Taishi. But his childhood friend, Mizuki, isn't about to let him go without a fight. Why she thinks he will somehow get trapped in the world of fan comics is anybody's guess. Maybe she has a crush on him?Funny, touching, and really shows us how things work in Japan when it comes to fan comics and the business of fan comics. Lots of good artwork, tons of extras and even a special mini episode to add to the other three full ones. That's the only reason it failed to get five points - not enough episodes for the price. But there is a lot of love and humor put into the disc. Even the cover is from right to left format ""Manga Style"" and it comes with a booklet that helps explain some of the scenes in the episodes, so you don't miss anything.For 13 and up, but I feel younger viewers can watch without a problem. 115 minutes total.Great stuff from the Rightstuf!"
4,beats are the best part,"i am a big fan of droop-e's production, and that pretty much was the driving factor behind my decision to buy this album. which is true; the production was definitely the bright spot on this album. I did feel like some other elements brought it down though. Lyrically, Droop-E and B-Slimm have a ways to go before they can be compared to the more polished rappers in the industry or even just in the Bay. and while some of the metaphors are pretty clever, a lot of them feel like they're forced. You'll see what i mean if you hear / read the lyrics.Overall I feel like the album was worth it because some of the songs are really good. And it's hard to find an album where you end up liking ALL the songs anyway."
5,They R Hella On Point,"4 Those Of U Who No N Those Who Dont No. Droop E Is Son Of "" The Ambassador Of The Bay-E 40. He Has Sum Major Skills, Not Only Him But Bslimm Is Coming Strong 2""If Yall Aint Got The Album, Yall Need 2 Get The Album. In My Opinion, This Is Da Best Album Of 2006. On Sum REAL, Droop E & BSlimm R Guna Get Far. Im Super Ready To C A Video. Hopefully We Wil B Seein 1 On BET,MTV2, N MTV Jams, If Main Stream Dont Pick Them Up, Hopefully, We Can C It In Da Town. VJTV Should Pick It Up. My Favorite Tracks Are: Out Here, Switchin Lanes N Droop E Groupie. Those R Hella Hyphy Like. I GUARANTEE YALL WIL LOVE DA ALBUM. SOO..... CLOSE DIS WINDOW, LEAVE DA HOUSE N RUN 2 DA RECORD STORE N BUY THE ALBUM. They R On Sum Real. SUPPORT THE BAY MUSIC SCENE, ITS A MOVEMENT IN HEAVY ROTATION. YEE!"
1,Didn't receive my order,I can't really write a review for this because I never received my ordered purchase. NOT happy about spending extra money to have it shipped priority next day and then not receive it. Very disappointed.
3,Good inner belt if using the rest of the Bianchi system.,"Has the hooks on the outside to work with the other bianchi belts. I've used this system before but the hooks were on the outer belt not this inner one which makes more sense. I think they only reversed it to make sure you have to buy both from Bianchi not another company as I can't locate another company that puts the hook on the inner belt and loops on the outer belt. The hooks catch on loose threads on your pant loops and fills up with threads that need to be pulled out. Also, when the loops wear out, which they do before the hooks, you have to replace the more expensive outer belt rather than the cheaper inner one. Also is rather flimsy, I would not wear it as an everyday belt, only with the outer belt is it useful."
5,Awesome,This is great. Who would have known how comfortable a belt is without a metal latch. I really like this belt and would recommend it to anyone.
2,Only If You Have Plenty of Room,"While this item functions as advertised, be aware that the clearance needed for your wheelbarrow will be great. The wheelbarrow is held in place by the lip of tub resting in these hooks while the handles prop against the wall. For most wheelbarrow designs this leads to the rest, including the wheel, sticking a significant distance out from the wall. This is the only item in the Gladiator line that we have not been pleased with so far. That said we are utilizing it to hand something else from."
1,Paying Money for online cards?,This game is one big money-making scheme! OK first you have to buy the game itself. If you do this u can set up an online account without paying the 10 dollars but it wouild be cheaper if you bought the game online without buying the cd! Second you have to buy online decks and cards for the prices they sell them in real life! I mean you have to pay ten dollars for an intangible version of a card that you will never really ever own! All they have to do is lower the prices to about 2 dollars per preconstructee deck adn they will generate much more capital per customer due to the fact that people are turned off by this game due to it's heavy cost! Wizards should be ashamed for making a high priced game like this..it's great to play IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO SPARE. BUYER BEWARE!
2,Hey! What a rip off!,"I can't believe this game! I paid $[money] canadian, and when I played it, I found out that you have to BUY your GAME CARDS online! Basically, your wasting...bucks so that you can play a very basic demo, unless you are willing to pay $[money](u.s.) for each virtual deck! There are a few 'up' points in this game; the avatars are cool, backrounds add a nice touch, and so do sounds. But, really, I hope I can get my money back for this phony game!I'd have to say, if the cards were included in the game, I would rate this game a 4 or 5, but paying for more on top of the game is just dumb.I mean, come on; THIS GAME SHOULD BE FREE!!! You should get it for free, then pay for the cards (hey, it makes sense, huh?)I can't believe I'm stuck with something I can't use..."
2,Magic Online,"I simply love Magic cards, and I probably will for a long time. Now, I am 12 years old and I don't know many people who play Magic cards, and this is a fairly good way to play. I don't own it, but I played the beta version. I loved it. But, in the beta version you didn't have to pay for your cards. THIS IS WHY I HATE MAGIC ONLINE!! I wouldn't mind if you had a monthly fee, but paying for cards that aren't real and could buy at a lower price is ridiculous. I think this is the game for people who are too lazy to go out and find a REAL LIFE Magic card tournament with REAL LIFE Magic cards. I, personally dislike this game because of the fact that you have to pay money for virtual cards. Strange..."
2,Warning! What you see is not what you get!!!!,"Hello?! I saw a product called Net Magic a couple years ago, that did exactly what this does for a good playable game, without all the bells and whistles. The only drawback was the programmer had to input all the cards and it took time.This game blows! You have to get the ""shell game"" first, then buy more cards online! Rediculous! Whats next? Buy the box at the store, then you would have to download the game online?Forget this product, pass it up, save your time and money, they are just ripping you off buy not selling you the electronic cards to go with the game. I am insulted this product ever hit the market..."
2,"Nice concept, big moneymaking scheme","This is not the same as playing magic in real life. If you already have a huge collection of real cards like me, you will have to start all over and pay for a bunch of ""virtual"" cards.Get the magic the gathering interactive encyclopedia, if you can even find it (I suspect wizards phased it out to make people buy this). It lets you play online and use any cards you want - even replicate your real life deck, or improve it.The encylopedia does not implement the rules, so you need to make sure you play with people who know them. Otherwise its much better than this."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"As a long time player, I thought it would be a good idea to be able to play online against anyone anytime. I thought this was the next evolution in the ""Magic interactive Encyclopedia"". Instead I find I have to buy electronic cards!! Worst yet, it cost just as much as buying real cards. Imagine now some hacker or fluke insident erases all your cards, What's left? ... A better alternative is to find a copy of the Interactive Encyclopedia and just play others online wiht every card ever made."
1,"Fun, but DO NOT BUY!!!!!!","Okay, first off, I love playing MTG. However, this game requires you to spend hundreds of dollars if you ever hope to build a truly great couple of decks. The prices alone lured me away within ten minutes. I bought this game used, luckily, so I didn't waste too much money. I installed the software, prepared to battle fellow MTG fans around the world, then saw the prices. I haven't turned the game on since. Don't be fooled by the fact it's online. If you ever see this game, run away. Far, far away!"
1,What an INCOMPLETE CD,"Now normaly when you buy an online game thats supposed to be a full version, you have expectations of playing that game soon after installing it. Well i must say that i installed this game in the late morning and I am STILL DOWNLOADING files and updates that are an apparent requirement FIVE HOURS later! For all of us that still are in the unfortunate dark age of dial up modems, the phone bill is going to be more expensive then the game is! And i havent even played it yet! If they plan on so many updates for a game that KNOWS it will require them, WotC should constantly send out new UPDATED CD's so that an entire day doesnt have to go by just to start playing a game. So to all those people out there that have dial up like myself, either switch to DSL or cable now or just dont bother with Magic Online. People are complaining about spending money on online cards, im complaining about spending more money on the game itself than i have to!"
4,General Neurosurgery,"Great book for the 1st year resident and 4th year medical student. Many radiographs, charts, tables, surgical line drawings, and good references throughout this textbook. It is an elegant hardcover ca 1999 with large print, therefore easier to read in the dark on-call rooms. I hope Drs. Loftus and Grossman decide to come out with a 3rd edition soon. One can still learn alot of Neurosurgery from this book. It's an investment worth making."
4,"Island Boyz give taste to ""Kohala Style"" with music","I had the cassette of this album and it finally wore-out. I really love this album and wish the boys had produced more. This album gives you the feeling of what ""Kohala Style"" is all about. I was in middle school when ""Special Love"" was very popular so listening to this album takes me back to memories... ""Katchi Katchi Regae"" is a fun song... all the songs are great! Usually I never pay above $15 for a CD, but this one is well-worth the investment."
3,predictable,"not a bad way to while away a few hours, but there are no surprises here, and not a lot of laughs. Also (call me picky) it was marred by obvious total lack of proofreading -- for example, the colorado ski town was called ""Vale"" rather than ""Vail"" and the past tense of ""broadcast"" was ""broadcasted"". These things may not bother some people, but to me it indicates that no one cared enough even to proofread the book."
2,Do NOT buy this book!,"I bought this book with the hopes of another fun ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" like read. I was sadly mistaken. Instead it turned out to be one of those books that I CAN put down, and that I wanted to stop reading halfway through, because the characters were all so uncompelling. Steve, her boyfriend, isn't even all that likeable, and neither is she. To top it all off, it's filled wtih too muc information sex scenes. All in all, this book is in no way a page turner, borrow it from a friend if you have to read it, don't waste your money on it"
3,Not Great,"This book wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. What's with neurotic women? I want to do this but I should do this but maybe I want to do this, I don't know, what do you think? This line of thinking is VERY annoying. Plus the plot got stupid halfway in when they changed the show from a reality show to a reality competition. That's when it lost my attention. And Steve's character wasn't well devloped. I'd say the neurotic woman was the most annoying point in this whole book. I would not recommend this to friends!"
2,Disappointed by Mlynowski,"Not the best book I've read by Mlynowski. Seemed to be a bit confusing and a lot of action without a lot of substance. My favorite book by Sarah Mlynowski would have to be Fishbowl. That kept me laughing throughout. This isn't too hard to get through as a chick lit book, but it definitely wasn't a book that I couldn't wait to get back to."
5,Sarah strikes again!,"I fell in love with Sarah with Milkrun. Fishbowl wasn't the greatest of follow-up books, so I was a tad leery of As Seen on TV. Still, the girl can write first person like nobody's business, so I bought ASOTV sight unseen.I was pleased, to say the least.For those who love (or hate!) reality tv, this is the book for you. It's hilarious, heartfelt, serious, lighthearted, romantic, cynical, and lovely! This book has it all, and it's spread like creamy butter over warm bread.A DEFINATE MUST for chick-lit fans. Read Sarah and you'll never go back!"
5,Her Best Yet,I've read milk run and As Seen on TV. They are both entertaining reads that I was unable to put down. But this one is my fave. The funniest part is the waxing scene...I won't give it away but you have to read it!
3,Not Mlynowski's best,"I love Sarah Mlynowski, but As Seen on TV, is not her best. It is a very enjoyable book, but the main character, Sunny, got on my nerves. Sunny was very annoying. I recommend it, but I think Fishbowl is better."
4,Good product.,"I liked it. Make sure you use it just after a bath or shower, when your skin is softer and is removed easier. Works much better than a blade. I would buy it again."
5,the best product!,"this really does the job. I had so much dry, and hard cracked heels, and dry callouses, and i bought this product hopeing it would do the job. i was afraid at first because my heels were so dry and rough. But i got my feet wet to the point where the cracked heel area was soft, and i started useing the product, and it took me several times to where it was completely off. it takes about 10 mins to get everything off for me. but it was all worth it bc my feet are so smooth, and i love it! my feet have never really looked this smooth before. if you want smooth feet all around, get this product!"
3,OK,I don't think this is a great product. You are better off with a Titania angled pumice sponge for less than $5.
2,Doesn't do a thing!,ok unless I'm using this wrong it doesnt work my feet are not smooth at all! might try with another product but i soaked my feet in bath so...
1,I just don't get it,"I bought these based on the reviews but let me tell you that these suck big time. I am a dude and I bought these for my wife because she needed one. She said they sucked so I tried them out myself just in case she was wrong. Nope, they really do suck. I have rough feet because I am a dude and I was expecting my feet to be like a baby's butt after using the smoother. They still felt like sandpaper. This is how I did it. I went and showered, waited a few minutes for my feet to soak up the water, then I started using this smoother. Nothing. Just crap. What a let down. I was planning on playing footsies with my wife without cutting her."
5,Awesome,This is a great foot file & saves a trip to get a pedi. I think this is the best ever out on the market! Buy it you will love it!
5,great item,item works great. no need to add expensive callus treatment to my salon pedicures. i also bought the callus eliminator & didnt need it .
5,Bye bye gnarly feet!,This is the best foot scrubber I have ever purchased and it's effective on both dry and wet feet. My super rough heels are incredibly improved after just 2 weeks of using this scrubber. Sweet results!
5,Awesome!,"This is the answer to rough heels. Forget all of those creams, etc...just use this in the shower every other day or so, and you will be amazed."
2,Disappointment and waste of money,"Given the reviews here, I thought that this was exactly what I needed. It arrived and I soaked my feet and put it to use. Almost nothing came of it. Pumice is so much better. Almost anything is better. It took a tiny bit of callous off with a great deal of effort. If one had very little callous and you wanted to polish your feet, this may be your ticket. If you want a good workout, this may be your ticket. If you want to blow $20, this is perfect. If you have real callouses, try something else."
1,Not worth it.,It is crap. A 2 dollar callous remover from CVS is better. I cannot beloved how flimsy and ineffective it is.
1,Does not work,Makes your feet rough and skin hangs off. It is better to use a pumice stone thatyou buy at the beauty store.
3,3.5 starts,"It works well, but I prefer an electrical device where i don't have to put in any work to get the job done."
2,Don't fool yourself,I have done much research on foot scrubs and this one sucks!!! I work in a high-end restaurant and am on my feet ALL the time and wanted something to scrub away the pain of a long day...this product is not it. Not sharp enough and doesn't scrub away what needs to be scrubbed away!!! Stay away!!
2,Not a good fit for serious callus',"Not a good tool for serious callus', if you have a large area that needs serious grinding this won't do the job, it is great for minor callus' but i had a serious job to do on my heel and this didn't take off the needed skin"
5,Denco Foot Smoother,"I was very skeptical about how well this foot smoother would work. All of the other products you can buy in retail shops just didn't work for me. This one is like the professional ones in the nail shops, and works really well! I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,"Good product, but not a ""lifetime"" product","My husband bought this foot smoother for me and it does a great job. I gave it three stars because the advertisement is misleading. It is supposed to have a lifetime warranty, but after a few months, the metal part grew dull with usage and we had to get a new one since it didn't leave the soles smooth. By the way, I get pedicures monthly so I really do not have very rough and callused soles."
3,Callus Shaver,"It works pretty well. It seems kind of large for removing small calluses. The blade is thin, and can be bent easily if you push too hard, or are not careful. I would say the the smaller callus removers are a better deal (Walgreens)."
4,Denco Easy Grip,"Not a ""cure all"" but a good tool. Works fairly well. It is well built and appears it will last a long time."
4,Good tool!,"Item handle has good length an grip. Proforated blade should be more sharper to remove more callus, however works well."
2,Not worth it,"This did not work for me. I have gotten pedicures at the nail salon, and saw them using this so I searched online looking for one and found the one. Maybe it was the brand, but this brand did not work for me....Would not recommend it...the seller shipped fast and prompt.."
1,Uninspiring jazz from a major talent,"Being a fan of jazz music from the hard-bop era I am always on the look out for new exciting talent. I have been following the musical progression of Danilo and although Central Ave was his latest and in my mind his best, he really has not produced a truly satisfying album throughout. This will come as Danilo develops his sound. I must say that Till Then is a major step back for Danilo. This is a very safe and fully unadventurous album. If you are a fan of the Pat Methany Group from the 80s or ""smooth"" jazz this will appeal. However if you are hoping to revitalize your jazz collection with some inspiring (cuban) jazz piano stick with Chucho Valdes or McCoy Tyner. Most listeners will realize that there is nothing new or interesting here by the third track. A major disappointment from a major talent."
5,Excellent Flight Mechanics Book!!,"This is by far one of the best written books on flight mechanics. Actually, it so good that I plan to teach a aircraft stability and control course using this book."
1,"Badly in need of an editor, and I can understand why.","Bakhtin is easier to read than Nielsen, as is Habermas. While the marriage of the two seems to me to be an interesting project, I suggest that a person desiring to do so go to the source, and not subject themselves to this offering.I'm guessing that Caryl Emerson wrote the introduction (which is lucid and interesting, eschewing cliche and polysyllabic nonsense) based on a draft of the book, or possibly an abstract. If one were looking at this book as a resume, the book would never be hired. Spelling mistakes abound, and the author misuses the word ""immanent"" before the end of the first fifteen pages. I confess I lost heart shortly thereafter.The author should blame his editor - I know that once one has wrestled with difficult ideas, it's difficult to remember that the squiggly red line under a word means the spelling is incorrect. Lesser minds sometimes need to point that out. Presumably none such were available."
4,Author on the come up!,"Ms. Black, you have penned a phenominal novel. It was hard to believe this was your debut! You were so descriptive that I felt like I knew these characters. You keep up the good work and I hope to meet you in my literary travels. I am the author of two novels and also am from Detroit. Again great job!"
2,A bit Blusey for me.,"I love jazz guitar, but the problem I have is finding new artists that are as good as my favorities(Ronny Jordan, and Norman Brown)In the pursuit of new artists, I happend to be a Virgin superstore in London, where I asked a gent to reccomend some smooth jazz peeps. This CD was thrown in my direction, and after a quick listen, I duly purchased. The first cut Boom, Boom is firing, and is the best cut of the album. After this procedings are mixed, with a general blues mix set into the whole procedure. If you likea bit of blues, cool, if not, then think again. Still looking for good artists in this genre."
2,"maybe a little too harsh, 2.5 stars, perhaps.",The first track on this album is excellent and thrilling. After that the album takes a tumble and the tunes fail to live up to the initial boom. Download this one off Kazaa - see Jeff live - but don't buy the CD... Sorry...
1,Disappointed,"I saw Jeff Golub in concert and rushed out to buy this CD soon thereafter. I found the CD to be a disappointment. The music he played, and how he played in concert was much better than anything on this CD."
2,"Sounds good on the web, but is lacking in person","I was quite excited about the premise of a well written guide book for tradecraft, but sadly I was dissappointed by the book in person. To me, it's more of book geared toward children and uninformed adults than any aspiring or practicing security professional. Alternatively, there are several books on the market that cover the same material in a much more indepths and professional manner. This book isn't that big, so you cant expect a full experience on all the topics. The surveillance section is only a few pages in length, while whole books have been written on the subject. Most of the book is a broad overview of several items and lack any real details that the book promises. There are several books similar to this that don't make you expect a full course in tradecraft like this one. In the end, its a good read for the inexperienced or those seeking a basic intro, but it definately is the bible of tradecraft that the description promises it to be."
3,OK--a good book for a highschool,"I got the feeling reading this that it would be a good book to have in a school library.Everything is given the once over lightly however and it doesn't cut the mustard as a serious, indepth book on the spycraft."
3,"OK, not great","I'm not sure why the sellers are asking so much money for this book. It is really not worth more than $15-20. The information in this book is not just used by spies in the field. It was an interesting review of what I learned in the military. The title of the book shook lean towards covert actions and tactics rather than spycraft. Unless you really want to spend the money, I would not recommend paying so much for this."
1,Not What I Expected!,"WARNING: THIS BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY WILLIAM D. WARREN, RENOUNDED HUMORIST AND AUTHOR OF HOW TO DIE: OR THE GOOD GATSBY.I saw this book for sale, and even though it was $100.00 I thought, 1000 pages by William D. Warren, who also goes by Wm. Douglas Warren, I will buy that for $100.00. No, no. It was a tragic mistake. While I was hoping for outrageous comedy and a laugh a minute narratives, all I got was a book about case studies and stuff legal issues. I guess I should have been tipped off by the name, but Warren is known for his subtleties, (as well as his not so subtleties), so I thought maybe it was just some joke I didn't get. NOPE! If you want a book about law and stuff, buy this one, but if you want a good book, buy How to Die: or The Good Gatsby."
1,A fan from Mexico,"I always buy products from amazon and I never have any complains about any of them. But about this product, I am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz. containers. I hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized."
4,Not bad but not all its claiming to be,"I don't know but I guess I expected more when they claimed Princess Rouge to be in the genre of Ah! My Goddess! and Video Girl Ai. I just didn't see much of that. Everything seemed kinda rushed.Two episodes/OVA's are in this video edition (60 minutes total running time). That could be why it lacks what it said, just to short. I'm hoping they release the rest of the series."
4,Author's CREDENTIALS are complete for this great book.,"This comprehensive book on the subject is packed with information learned the hard way from an experienced pro. Practical, sample newsletters and business principles specifically focused on the newsletter business was very informative. Answered all my question plus some I couldn't think of prior to reading."
1,What have you been smoking?,"I believe that this movie was done as a film school project at a community college. I have a taste for gore,storyline,plot,and art direction. This film unfortunatley contained none of these, the acting shallow and uninspired, could not even be laughed at as being campy. If you see this film for sale or rent run don't walk to the nearest exit, and save yourself a few dollers to put toward a more worthy movie in the Hammer or Ramie camps."
3,Excellent but old,"The book is excellent for theoritical part of the environmental health, however the data provided are now old. It is indeed urgency if the authors initiate to publish new edition."
5,Great Book!,"I found this book very useful in my class, ""Environmental and Occupational Health."" The stats and figures are clear and the wording makes it an easy read."
3,Pretty good dub,"This is good kick back music. Fun to listen to when you are writing reviews for cd's at Amazon.com. Everything here has a spacey psychedelic feel to it with some robotic sounds echoing throughout. I prefer a more rootsy dub by the likes of Black Uhuru or even the spacey sounds of Lee Scratch Perry though. All in all not the best, but easy to listen to."
3,cheaply made,"Was not impressed with the material, it snagged on everything. The velcro in the back, snagged easily to the material, therefore pulled the costume apart."
4,Vol 2,Great continuation! I can't wait to read more of this. This volume seemed a little short but was still good.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Yorick has gained some companions. Agent 355 is working for the mysterious Culper Ring, some sort of ultra-secret spook organisation. It is not quite clear who is pulling her strings, or the strings of her agency. There ia also a scientist who specialises in biology and genetics, and she hopes that Yorick and Ampersand can help her make a cure.They all have to survive an ex-prison town, a crazed Amazon cult, and Yorick's sister, first."
4,TRACK LISTING: (Grrrrr!!!),"I hate when the page does not have the track listing. No wonder some people don't like internet shopping, grrrrr!1. Laugh to Keep From Crying2. Crimes of Passion3. Ain't No Big Deal ('97 Edit)4. Everybody ('97)5. Burning Up6. Ain't No Big Deal ('81)7. Everybody ('81)8. Stay ('81)9. Don't You Know10. Ain't No Big Deal ('97 Extended Version)Basically, this is Madonna's pre-stardom demo material. It is okay but I would recommend it only for those who collect all things Madonna. Some of the material was remixed into dance or down-tempo versions probally to jump on the remix bandwagon as remixing has become commonplace these days."
4,good going stranger,"""Pre-Madonna"" is a bootleg CD that first went on sale 11 years ago. The date of 7-23-03 is totally incorrect, perhaps that is the date that it was first offered on this site. It was originally only offered by ordering it over the phone (no Internet ordering!) and it came out in late '96/early '97; to capitalize on Madonna's popularity due to EVITA. The songs on this CD are a lot like the songs on Madonna's first studio album, aptly titledMadonna. Although this is an unofficial recording (unofficial defined as not giving any proceeds to the recording artist,) the quality is excellent and the tracks are first rate. If you are a Madonna fan, collector or just someone that enjoys early 80's music you will enjoy this CD. There are several other bootleg Madonna CDs (released in the early 90's and mid/late 80's after she hit it big,) but this is the very best one!"
1,waist of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have had 6 of these monitors and they all broke in the same place. For some reason the camera head is not tight and it comes loose. My husband even tried to put super glue on it and still doesn't work. The longest one ever worked was for 3 weeks. I am so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,American Ruins isn't a ruin,This book is full of great photograghy for the average person. The book is more photos then information. An excellent book though.
3,Beautiful Images,"A lovely collection of abandonments and ruins, ""American Ruins"" was predictable in its selections of locations (Bannerman's Castle was an obvious choice!), thin on quantity, and should have been published as a hardcover addition. While the size of the book is suitable to a photograpy coffeetable collection, the material here is just not substantial enough to rate it in this category. You can flip through ""American Ruins"" in ten minutes or less! While the concept behind the book is exquisite and something that, while not original, could have made for a magnificent volume, in this instance, ""American Ruins"" was simply smacked together and does not rate. Glance at a copy in your library if you are curious, but save your cash for a much larger volume of more adventurous photography."
4,Interesting Infra-red Photos,"IR photography was popular some 50 years ago and remains an interesting way to view landscapes. The MOST interesting facet of the book is the selection of ruins that, in many cases are little known outside their immediate area."
5,Wonderful!,"After viewing the glowing segment on The CBS Morning Show, I had to see this book. AMERICAN RUINS truly deserves the accolades, awards and attention it's receiving. Arthur Drooker's exquisite photographs transport you and his descriptive prose is as elegant and moving as his haunting images. So, thank you, Mr. Drooker for this treasure about our national treasures... and for making my holiday shopping so easy!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was intrigued when I first saw this book on Amazon, and was pleased to later receive it as a gift. But I was immediately disappointed when I discovered that the images are all infrared photos. The result is certainly not informative, nor would I consider it art. Rather, they are overstylized, self-consciously ""arty,"" and frankly hacky-tacky. Why, when one has subjects as dramatic as these, not present them as is? Why deny the reader/viewer the chance to see these buildings and places as they really look? I recommend instead any of Camilo Jose Vergara's books. His images of American ruins are probably more journalism than art, but they at least let the fascinating ruins speak for themselves."
5,Best Latin Christian music,"My favorites are ""Solo tu"" and ""De creer en ti"", but most of the songs are really good, and have that Christian theme going on. This is by far her most Christian-like Latin album she has, you'd have to go with English albums to find another CD with as much Christian themes. Her voice is beutiful, also recommended is her other album which features, ""Como se cura una herida""."
5,Jaci does it again...,"Jaci continues to amaze me and now she does it in Spanish. This cd is gorgeous, as much as I like the spanish versions of her English hits, what I found most enticing were the brand new Spanish songs. Con Tu Amor is classic Rudy Perez (producer) and the vocals rock. Llegar A Ti is one of the most lush and gorgeous ballads I have heard in years. She is already exploding onto the Latin charts...you go girl!"
5,What an awesome outreach opportunity,"This disc is amazing. Possibly her best. But most of all, what a great outreach opportunity it represents. Christian churches have embraced english christian music for so long now as a great way to communicate the Gospel to youth in particular. Now, finally, a disc that does the same for the Spanish speaking world. And with vocals, songwriting and instrumentation that all meet or exceed the expectations of Ricky Martin or Selena fans.Catchy, well produced music that can change lives. Gracias a Dios!"
5,Tiene una maravillosa voz.,"Me gustan sus canciones,pues,tienen un mensage positivo.De verdad que ella es una exelente cantante, y cuando can-ta lo hace con el corazon.Dios te bendiga ricamente, Jaci."
2,A case of beginner's bad luck,"Jaci really misfired on this one. Aside from one decent single, the rest of this album is just awful. And, being that it was her first crossover attempt, failed in every way. It was a stumble, but Jaci's next few were awesome.I wouldn't even recommend this if it were 1999 again. The quality is subpar compared to Thalia, Noelia--heck, even Paulina. It is possible to make a clean, family friendly latin pop album without sucking."
4,great team building ideas!,"I have been doing Team Building activities with my special education high school students for two years now. I am always looking for new and ""fresh"" ideas.Team Challenges is just the ticket!"
4,Workable team building activities,"this book provides workable team building ideas: it provides obtainable materials, provides approximate length of activities and breaks it down into different sections."
3,"Team Challenges: 170+ Group Activities to Build Cooperation, Communication, and Creativity","The activities in the book are good and could easily be adapted for many age groups, but the instructions do not include enough detail and no mention of debriefing the activities."
5,timeless and well-written,I just re-read this book and have shared it with several families in my neighborhood. Two teenagers up the street have customized their own version of some of these activities for school - now that's a compliment.
3,Team activities,The suggested materials in many of the activities seem to be from several years ago when they weren't so expensive.
3,A regular book,"I really expected more from this book. I think it's a bit complicated in your organization. In addition, some exercises and challenges for the facilitator's answer is unclear. As a result there has been very helpful."
4,Easy Math learning for kids,I bought this game for my 5 year old son to learn maths. He is currently using the first 2 levels Addition & subtraction. I am really happy that the time he is spending on this game is well worth since this one is helping him to improve his mathematical skills.For beginners this is really nice and its well worth the money. Moreover this item was shipped faster than the one week time and I got this by the 5th day.
4,Fun and learning,"My 8 year old is not enjoying math at this point in school, but she is enjoying the challenge of answering the problem as quickly as she can with this game. I think this is actually helping a little."
5,Math is fun?????,"With Leapsters Cosmic Math, it is!!!!!!!!!!! We have 3 Leapsters and tons of the games, and my kids LOVE learning this way!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,it's just ok,"I got this for my 7 year old 2nd grader as a fun way to practice math facts (she hates flash cards). She and her 9 year old 4th grade sister agree that it's fun, but it moves too slowly to really be engaging for very long. There is only one activity on it, and it is very much like another title ""Number Raiders"" that they have. They don't play with either very much, and when they do they don't play for very long (20 minutes, maybe?). So in the end not very many math facts get learned or practiced, although as a game it's good for a bit of fun occasionally. Might be good on a trip or a rainy day to occupy some time."
1,"faulty design, get the warranty if you want the tv","it has a transformer that blows out the fuses. call the local philips repair shops and see how many they have. If it breaks after the short warranty you will pay through the nose to have it fixed or carry 140lbs to some store. Philips has a dead pile of them on their outlet store that they will sell to you for $400, then it it up to you to get them fixed. They say they are refurbished, but they arrive dead and you can not return it.before you buy from outlet dot philips dot com , read the fine print on the refurbished tv's. No returns No credit...They are a 10 billion dollar a year company, they used to be decent. Buy a tv from a local store so you have someone who is responsible if it breaks."
3,Good for amatuers,This was my first mp3 player.It was my partner for about 6 months.(I currently own Sony's MD Player)Sound quality is comaparitively average. I recommend you to go with sony's.Its some what bulky.Though great for amateurs.
2,"A nice toy for a geek, not a player.","Well, I've got an SP90 and have returned it in two days. Why?Pros. Really nice gadget. Lots of tweaks. Really powerfull stuff.Cons. It skips. In fact, it skips a lot. I was unable to use it in the car... This unit lacks a car power adapter - in fact, it was not designed for a car use. Unlike Philips Expaniums, it turns off immediately when you plug out the power cord while Expanium just switches to the batteries.Well, my old Expanium EXP103 sounded much better. Now I'm with Expanium EXP503..."
1,Terrible product - skips all the time,"Don't waste your money on this one. I purchased the SP90 for Christmas and it gave me a full 3 hours of performance before it failed miserably. I couldn't figure out why. The disc kept spinning so the battery level wasn't low. Only there was no music coming out of the player at all. I tried regular audio CD's and data CD's (with MP3 songs) but it still would not perform. I've made about 150 online purchases in my life and have had to return maybe 3 items. This will be one of them.Pro'sNone, even the case looks like a toyConWhen it worked, the player skipped constantly. Unacceptable since I used to have a Panasonic CD player with 40 sec memory that never skipped on me even when jogging.In cold weather, the disc would not spin up to speed and thus would not produce music.When battery runs low, CD spins but no music producedPlayer takes forever to seek MP3's.Short battery life"
2,This is NOT a portable CD player,I purchased this CD player because of the anti-skipping claim and that others had recommended it for running. I can not use this player unless it is placed on a table and not moved. It skips at the slightest movement. Certainly can't recomment it to anyone. It was a waste of my money.
4,Good value,"I've been looking at mp3 players for quite some time before finally buying this one, and I have to say, I'm very happy with the product, especially considering the price. I followed the directions for the upgrade, and it wasn't too difficult. I had to shake it around pretty vigorously to get it to skip with a standard CD playing, and couldn't get it to skip at all with an MP3 CD. If you're not experienced at coding, it helps to read the review from ""muchas gracias"" and I was able to find a free hex editor online by just entering that as the subject in my search engine. It is true that the headphones that come with the unit are not that great, and it would be nice to have an FM tuner, but I really don't think you can beat this one for the price. All in all, it's a good performer."
4,RioVolt SP90 CD/MP3 Player,I travel by airplane nearly everyday of the week. I found myself tired of changing CD's frequently. The thought of 150 - 200 songs on one CD was very appealing. I looked around for some time before deciding on this unit. I use it with Bose QuietComfort AcousticNoise Cancelling Headset. This is an excellent combination and the RioVolt is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a CD/MP3 player.
2,Piece o' ....,"A boyfriend bought this as a gift for me after I checked out the reviews on amazon.com and thought it looked pretty good. At first, it was great. However, within 2 months I was having problems similar to those others have mentioned on here, including: 1) CDs (both MP3 and regular) taking either forever to start playing or NEVER playing (spinning and spinning but never starting!); 2) the CD would start playing but would suddenly hang up in the middle of track, or at the beginning of the track. I called customer service; they told me to try cleaning the laser lens. So I bought a kit, did it over and over again - and, no improvement. In fact, the lens cleaning CD itself kept hanging up!! So I just called customer service again and they are going to replace it with a new product, apparently a totally different model although they wouldn't say which one. *sigh* Just hope the new one works better!!! I would stay away from this model...."
2,Good luck getting it to work,"I burned MP3s at 256 kbps, 128 kbps, j-stereo, stereo, I burned on Verbatims, Kensiko, and some unnamed CD-R brand. I tried burning MP3s by different bands. I used Nero, Adaptec, and MusicMatch to burn. This [player]would NOT play ANY MP3 CD I tried to make. My DVD player, which plays MP3s, could play them fine. My computer could play them fine. The product will play regular CDs, but not CDs with MP3s. The product contains minimal documentation, a small unfolding sheet of paper...Overall this product is a giant headache..."
2,Poor anti-skip behavior,"I use my RioVolt SP90 to listen to music and audio tapes while walking for exercise. I have found to be quite undesireable for this function, due primarily to the short 120 second anti-skip buffer. Invariably, withing 15-20 minutes of starting my walk, it runs out of buffer and stops playing. From then on, it plays a few seconds, then stops for as much as a minute before resuming. Very frustrating. No matter how I carry it, I cannot avoid the severe interruptions in play. I guess it would be an okay player if you have it setting on a desktop or something."
2,they break down aftera while,"I have had now two different Rio Volt SP90 stop working out of the Blue. I probably used each for around 3 months and they stopped working.The first stopped reading CD's, the second stopped spinning. It seems to be common for this product. Stay away! (While it worked it was very good, though it skipped a LOT, I couldn't even walk with it in my pocket)."
1,Poor Quality Player,"I bought this player and made a mp3 cd on my computer (at a speed of 2X)After putting the cd into the player and waiting for ten minutes for the player to load, a message said ""No Disc"" After following the instructions for this problem on the website, the problem persists. I exchanged the player for the same on and had the exact same problem. Neither of these players played regualr audio cds either, on looked as though it was playing, but there was no volume, the other just didn't play. I strongly suggest you don't waste your time and money on this unpredictable, player of poor quality and performance."
1,It won't play an entire CD without failing,"I listen to music every day in my office so I thought that having an mp3/cd player would be ideal. The product worked great for about a month. Then it started having problems where it would be in the middle of a song and it would just shut off, but it didn't happen that often. I've had it for two months now and I can't get it to play an entire CD without shutting it's self down. Usually it just plays a song or two before it stops working. I wanted to return it when it first started having problems but like I said it worked great for a month. This is the worst product I have ever purchased."
1,it is bad,i wanted this for ever and when i got it i took it out of the box.I listened to it for around 4 hours. then i walked away. i came back 3 days later and it doesnt work! i have changed the batteries and still nothing.
4,It's the Tightest MP3 Player for a Krazy Price,"It has tons of features including preset equilizers like Rock, Jazz, Classic, Ultra Bass, and more and it's better than the philips because it has more capability's and has a LCD screen which shows the songs titles I would recomend this if u want a mp3 player don't get any other than Rio because there the worlds leader in mp3 music"
1,"You won't get the rebate, but it's no good anyway.","This is the worst electronic device I have ever purchased, and I have bought plenty. I wanted something to play both cd's and mp3's. I bought it solely on price at Best Buy, because it had a [X] rebate. Best Buy told me to make a COPY of the UPC symbol to send in for the rebate, or my warranty would be voided with them. I did so. After waiting about six weeks, I got a notice from Sonic Blue saying that I couldn't get the rebate because I didn't send them the original.Even though they put you in this Catch-22 situation, it's a piece of crap. You can't find a cigarette lighter adapter that will work with it. When I finally MADE one, from a tip that fit and a plug with the right current/voltage, it would only work with CD's. MP3's wouldn't work at all.It has no backlight, so forget about using it in the dark, unless you're blind and used to feeling your way around."
1,Broke within 6 months,"About 75% of the time, it wouldn't be able to start playing my cds (whether storebought or home burned). When it did play, most of the time it would get stuck after a couple of songs. Save your money."
4,"Excellent, but not good for something to take while jogging.","I got this about 3 years ago and it's always worked wonderfully well. If you are transfering from one of those standard portable cd players with cds that hold around 15 songs, then you won't want to go back if you buy this. With mp3 format, you can go from that 15 songs to over 200, without losing cd quality. Keep in mind that some downloads may have low quality, so if you are unsatisfied with a track, it's probably not the player. If you shake it around alot(like when jogging), then you will have trouble with skipping. Thats the reason for the 4/5. Also, I don't recommend using this with heavy duty batteries because it will only last about 1 1/2 - 2 hours. I do recommend purchasing rechargable Nimh batteries, as they last around 30 hours. This also comes with a car adapter which allows you to play your cd player through the car speakers if you have a cassette player on your vehicle.I hope you enjoy yours as much as I have mine."
3,Strictly for light use,"I bought this this player on a budget after doing a lot of research on it. I might have waitied and got the sp-250 but i would have lived. FIRST, DO NOT buy this player if you're a sloppy person who might drop it a few times. Mine fell on a carpet from 2.5 feet, and it has not worked without exhaustively shaking and messing around with it. SO don't ever bother jogging with it either. IF you want the bare-bones player that basically plays a god-damn CD, then buy this, don't expect too much with user functionality though, there are EQ settings, i like bass, but the U-Bass feature had too much bass and the rock feature didn't have enough. Despite that, the sound quality is still decent. Dont forget, this doesnt have all sorts of fancy bells and whistels, very very very basic functions. But still a good budget choice. 3/5"
2,Worked 4 a while,"mine worked for about 11 months then it just quit workinguntill then i was really impressed,ooks good,sounds good,plays mp3 cds then it quit reading cdsit dosent read cds or mp3 cds any more its a giant paper wieght"
2,Batteries don't last that long,"This is an average cd/mp3 player, it's nice that it supports CD text and CDRW. I've never had it run for 15 hours, this is due to the anti-skip function; this feature spends a lot of electricity, and there isn't a way to turn it off. You'll find yourself buying pairs of alcaline batteries after 2 to 4 hours of use. The lack of a backlit display doesn't help either, save your money for some other cd player. Cheap things become expensive in the long run..."
1,Worst CD player I've ever owned,"I looked around, I read the reviews, I followed advice. Never again. This cd player has failed on every level to live up to its expectations. The battery life is nowhere near 15 hours. The sound quality isn't even remotely as good as the last portable cd player I had for 7 years. It did not come with an AC adaptor. Half the time I cannot even get it to play a regular cd. The instruction and problem solving booklet that comes with it is archaic and remedial at best. If I still had the packaging I would find a way to return it. But I don't, so I'm going to have to spend more money to get a REAL player, and give this one away as a joke. RioVolt, never again."
1,Too bad you can't get it open,"The packaging is absolutely indestructible. You can't get it open. I had to stab the plastic shell with a large pair of scissors, and then step on it and pry the plastic packaging back, while it cut my fingers in several places. I'm sweating and bleeding now. Whoever decided to packag it this way is a total moron."
3,this thing stinks,"i have a riovolt sp100, which is the same thing than this one. however this one is much cheaper. so i am very disappointed from sonicblue.i think this player is the cheapest one in the market, so its a good deal if you get it."
1,Too hot=no play.,"I received this CD player as a hand-me-down from an older sibling, and, at that point, it was in seemingly perfect working order. Turns out, it was in perfect working order, but only some of the time. It skips more often than Michael Jackson gets a plastic surgery and will short out if it is too hot/cold wherever you are using it. Furthermore, I timed how long it takes to load a cd, when it was working, and it sometimes took over a minute and a half. The buttons are too sensitive and the equalizer settings are less than grand. Overall, a great paperweight, but not a good cd player."
1,Poor Support,I purchased this unit Sept 2001. Late October it ceased working - no power. I contacted RioVolt and was issued an RMA to return the unit (late November). More than 30 days later I still don't have a replacement. Try to get a live person at RioVolt to talk to - you can do e-mails or internet - nothing else. I'm just sitting and waiting.
2,Disappointing ESP and Battery Life,"This product had two major drawbacks: First, the ESP, which is represented to be 120 seconds, is much much shorter for standard audio CDs. That is supposed to be 10sec/40sec. However, it is the shortest 40 seconds I have ever experienced. Moreover, the included instructions, online user guide and telephone tech. support are all inaccurate as to how that function is used. (It's not a switch, it's in the user preferences menu).The second problem is battery life. I got through 2.5 CDs with the included alkaline batteries.All in all, you would probably be better off spending a little more money to get a better product."
4,It served me well...,"This was my first MP3 player that I used. I got a Nomad Jukebox (I think it was the first one released...)for Christmas, and it wouldn't connect to my computer. I decided that I didn't want a hard drive mp3 player and took it back. The Rio Volt was sitting in the display case at Comp USA, so I bought it. I think I payed $[$$] for it (it was a 1.5 years ago), which was better than the Nomad. It was easy to use, just burn the mp3s onto a CD. It took a while to load the disk, and it felt kinda heavy. The navigation was frustrating, but it worked. The battery life is amazing on this thing! I think two AAs would last me 20+ hours, which is much better than the 8 hours I get on my 10gb iPod.If you are looking for a[n inexpensive] and easy way to get into mp3s, and have a CD burner (who doesn't these days?), look no further than the Rio Volt.p.s. if you can fork over the cash, an iPod would be a much wiser investment."
1,just quit working!,Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and it has already stopped working - and we are not even at the end of Jan! Not misuse or dropping - it is just inferior quality. This was a second attempt at this brand. A previous RioVolt CD Player - different model also proved very unreliable. I am now going to attempt to contact the company and get reimbursed but I am not optimistic.
2,If you can get it to work!!,My RioVolt SP90 sounds great the few times I've heard anything from it. With any little movement the adaptor loosens and no more sound. The little dancing men are wothless.
3,MP3 Player ...,"I bought the RioVolt SP90 CD-MP3 Player mostly for the MP3 playing abilities and so far, it has met all of my expectations. If you're looking for a simple [inexpensive] way to play your MP3s this maybe the player for you.I've only got two real complaints. First of all the thing not only is [inexpensive], it looks [inexpensive] too. The unit is light and has a somewhat flimsy feel to it. This is made worse by the matte finish blue and grey plastic used in it's construction. If styling is your thing you'd better move on to a different product. The SP90 looks and feels like one of the kids toys out of a McDonald's happy meal.My second complaint is the battery life. In the few days that I've owned this unit, I've already blown through 6 AA batteries in about 20 hours of use.These complaints aside, the SP90 does the job. If no frills MP3 playback is your thing, give the SP90 a look"
4,"Good for the price, not for loud places","Good battery life, no back light, maximum volume is low. good price. Durable...I've dropped it twice still works."
3,Not the best choice,I bought this player to use in a car. What is good?1. Reads all my disks with complex directory structures and names in different languages without problem.2. Sound quality surprisely good for the non audi vendor.3. Navigation within folder reasonable easy4. A separate line audio outWhat is bad?1. Start disk from begining after turning off2. Battery life isn't so good as claimed3. Display is too small and some information not useful4. No backlit
1,It was amazing. . . for about two months,"I have to admit, when I first bought this piece of junk I was highly pleased. It had all of the features I was looking for and the price was right, even though it has sort of a cheap feel to it. Plus, I was so excited that I could fit 100+ songs on one CD.Then things went very wrong. First I found out that a pair of AA batteries would last- oh- maybe through one CD. Then the damn thing started skipping. At first it wasn't too noticeable. Now, any slight move I make the thing skips. Forget walking anywhere with it, or even riding in a bumpy car or train. My friend had the same problem with hers, sent it back to Sonicblue for repairs and two months later is still waiting for a response. Now tell me, how am I supposed to listen to music like this? Now ($$$) seems waay to much to pay for this thing."
4,Don't Listen to These Reviews,"Many people on this site are crazy! I bought this product at least six months ago, and for fun, I decided to see what these intelligent Amazon reviewers had to say about my beloved RIO VOLT. Well, The 1-star comments are complete trash, I suggest you dont waste your time reading them. It is quite apparent to me now that some people have no clue how to use electronics. I wouldn't say I know a lot, but I know enough to be able to use this product! Come on, if you can't get this simple product to work IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT! There is no way that the RIO VOLT doesn't work. I could be happier with it. In hindsight however, I would recomend a higher model, because the SP90 is getting outdated. In conclusion, I recomend this Product if you know how to use a computer. IE; you can type a history paper on Microsoft Word."
5,You want stylish? You Got It!,"This is the best cd player ever. It never skips, is so stylish, and is just plain awsome! If your looking for something that you will really get a lot of use out of, you really should get this.Thanks!Morgan"
3,SPEND MORE MONEY ON BATTERIES THAN CD PLAYER,"This was my first CD mp3 player that I purchased. If you are thinking about buying this CD player maybe look at getting something else, beacause of many things:1- It has horrible batterie life due to the large screen and the moving text.2- It can not play small CD RW's. It starts to play it but skips like crazy!!! When went to web site and called the custumer service was horrible.For these reasons I ended up purchasing a SONY CD/MP3/ATRAC/FM/AM/TV/Weather for about 90 dollars. With this you can burn a CD with over 500 songs on it and the batteries will last days and days of continuded playing.DON'T GET THIS PRODUCT LOOK AROUND!!!!!!!!"
1,research other products before buying this one,"i got this player for a christmas present in 2001. it broke in march of 2002. one day, i pressed play and it said that there was no cd in it. now, only one cd works in it. and when i do put that cd in, it skips and i can barely hear the song. i do not recommend this prodcut to anyone who wants to buy a cd/mp3 player."
3,Didn't do what I thought it would do,"This was a gift, and although I read it a few times, it was not a treue MP3 player. My grandson, although somewaht dissapointed, said that it was of very good quality and seemed to enjoy it very much."
2,Poor WMA Playback,"The unit did not do well at playing back WMAs. I tried various bit rates and burn rates on the CD burner as suggested in the accompanying leaflet, but the thing would not play back without glitches. The WMAs played back fine on the computer."
1,RioVolt review,This Player skips when playing audio CD's. It doesn't have near the 40 sec anti-skip protection it claims. I can not play CDs while walking with it in my bookbag. It skips too often (about every 5 secs).
2,"Skip, Skip and Skip!!!","It felt better than it looked. I mean it looks like a kids toy, that would break easily. I was totally stoked to have a portable Mp3 player! 200+ songs on a disk? Great!! But... You can't see the display very well, it ate batteries like crazzzy, but the Skipping was what made me take it back. 120 seconds? NO WAY!! how about NO seconds!! Can't walk with it! Can't use it in the car! And there is absolutly No Way you can jog or run with it!!!Useless!Picked up a Phillips JogProof. Doesn't play mp3's but it Does play my CD-R's and I can Run and Jog and NO SKIPPING!!If you want something to carry, Skip the RioVolt SP90."
2,good for about 3 months,"I got this mp3 player last christmas..... about 2 months later, the anti skip barely worked, it would wit perfectly still on a table and skip.... after another month of putting up with that it broke down completely and I just gave up at trying to fix it... now I'm getting a new mp3 cd player if your rich and can afford to replace it every 3 months then go ahead and buy it, it was great while it lasted"
2,"Finicky, eats batteries, then dies for good.","I have been thrilled to have an MP3 player and this one did the job - for a few months. Yes, it went through batteries every 3-4 hours, but I got some NiMh rechargables and was not too unhappy to change them. I bought a radio shack power adapter, but it would not work right with it. Too finicky. And it seems to have no skip protection for MP3. I used it in my car, but on bumpy highways it would not work.Now it is 7 months old and has suddenly failed. It keeps saying ""no disc"" no matter what disc I use. I went to the Sonicblue site and found this problem in the Frequently asked questions, so I know it's a common problem. I tried to find out about repair, but that part of the site is missing. So, I now must buy another player and toss this one.Some people may have had better luck, but I think that it would be a big risk to buy from this company or any future version of them."
2,RioVolt sp90,"This player works well as a cd player. After 7 months it suddenly says ""no disc"" sounds like it is a common problem.....any advise ??? should I just toss it..."
4,Very cool,"... it is a great MP3-CD player for it's price. I would rate this less than 4 stars, but it is actually a pretty good CD player with a lot of nice features. I just think it is bare-bones in comparison to the SP-100. The best feature about this player isn't even a feature, but the price. It is so inexpensive, but it is really cool. I wouldn't spend $$$ more for a remote, a backlit display, and a stupid looking carrying case that the SP-100 has. If I wanted to spend that much on a CD player, I would get the iRiver SlimX."
3,average performance! I expected more.,"The technology is good and the rio sp90 is useful if you are doing a lot of travelling. If you are sitting in front of the computer all the time I would recommend you to use winamp and be happy. If you want to use it during workout, you are probably well off buying an IPOD.The anti-skip feature is not effective and that is a big pain.Sp90 is not worth 99$ . If you can get it for 60$ it is worth it."
1,stinks - beware,"My unit skipped continuously when playing MP3 cds even when COMPLETELY STATIONARY. Some CDs were more affected than others, but they all skipped no matter what bitrate or CD format. I contacted customer support, but they have yet to reply after almost a week. Some reviewers said that the firmware upgrade fixed their problems with skipping, but it did not work for me. The player seems to be genuinely unupgradeable as Rio claims. The player regarded the upgrade CDs with much interest and spun back and forth for some time, but it had no effect and the player still [stinks]. It almost works tolerably well as a simple audio CD player, but I could get a better one... I got a Koss car kit as some reviewers suggested, but the cigarette adapter did not function either. BEWARE. There are SERIOUS quality control problems with this company."
1,[Junk],Thsi unit may start out good but if u use it alot stuff will start to happen. i sually listen to it while im walking and it's horrible it will constantly skip and the Anti Shock is a load of junk. I would recommend getting the RioVolt SP250.Don't buy it
4,A very good basic MP3/WMA/CD Player,"This is the kind of product I've been waiting for!, if you hate those small MP3 players that just have 64MB or less then you'll love this, you can burn a CD-R (or even a CD-RW) with loads of MP3s and WMA files, and you can get more than 10 hours of music.However you *need* a CD Burner to take advantage of this product, and there's a better version of this player that has more features, the one that's missing here is the support for WinAmp M3U playlists and a backlit LCD screen. But this is a very good choice, try it!"
3,Get ready for a new approach to portable music,"It was difficult at first to prepare a cd-rw the SP90 would successfully play. You need to record the tunes at 128 kbs in mp3 or wma format using 1X sampling. Keep all the tunes on your computer until you are ready to burn the CD-RW or CD-R. Burn it in one session at 1 or 2X, not a faster rate. The SP90 will only index what's on the disk from the disk's first session. If you use wma format, you can put about 20 hours of music on one disk, and the player will only have to spin the disk intermitently to play the tumes. You should expect battery life of over 10 hours. Sound quality is excellent. When you get used to how to make disks for it, this machine is a bargain compared to players that use a hard drive.The Rio website is poor at providing access to the purchase of a carrying case or AC adapter. Except for the tedium of preparing a compressed disk for it, this machine leads the way to what we want: a lot of music in a small space."
4,Pretty good.,"The Rio Volt sp90 is not a bad little player. Its considerably cheaper than the Rio Volt sp100 and Rio Volt sp250 (NICE!!!!) It has most of the features of the sp100, except the backlit screen, the remote control (you can buy a better remote for the sp90 than what comes with the sp100) and the firmware upgradeablility... But since im only 13, my income was limited at the moment and I bought the sp90. Its a great upgrade from my original cd/mp3 player (the Classic CM415, dude, that was a piece.....) and it has most of the features of the sp100, and one of the ones it doesn't have you can buy.The sp90 has all of the good stuff that comes with top of the line cd/mp3/wma players, and looks pretty pimpin. So I think if you want a very good player for a low price, go with this one..."
3,the sp90 Portable CD-MP3 Player,This player uses up AA batteries really really fast. Not good unless you usually plug it in the cigarette lighter.
3,"Skipping, skipping, skipping.","This is a great little player with plenty of cool functions. It is only good, however, so long as you are sitting still. Even with the firmware upgrade, mine skips when I run, drive in the car, and even WALK. It is incredibly annoying. Whilst exercising with it, it will stop playing every few minutes, and I will have to stand still and wait for the file to load back up. The 120 second anti-skip protection is a total joke. I would not recommend this item unless you plan to go NOWHERE with it. VERY frustrating."
1,Short-lived,This player worked beautifully for about 8 months. It is now completely dead and non-functioning. I can't believe I paid all that money for something that only worked for 8 months! What a waste.
5,Firmware upgrade not needed...,"I received it today, expected to try it out and then upgrade the firmware. Well I grabbed an mp3 cd, plopped it in, and the first song started playing in 3 seconds! Lag between songs is 1-2 seconds. Okay, I thought this was a fluke, so I grabbed another mp3 cd. Same thing. Okay, I tried a cdrw disk and that took 5 seconds. Either way, even if you can no longer upgrade using the hack (I have not tried), the new models appear to work much better than previous revisions.I don't have the best hearing, but it was loud enough for me... as long as your mp3 rips have decent levels. The earbuds are acceptable. Overall, I'm very pleased."
5,Very good product for the mp3 fan in all of us.,"I was going to get one of these things and I was looking to buy a m*morex brand one but i read alot of bad reviews. I then stumbled across this and read all of these other rewviews and I liked what I saw. This thing rocks, I am listening to a cd I just made with 219 mp3's at 128 bit. They sound just as good as they do on winamp.I suggest getting this if you are looking for a cd player that also plays mp3's. There are 2 vital things that you need to know if you have trouble with your songs or anything else...1. Burn the mp3's at 2x or slower(yeah I know...slow but it works!)2.The ones at 128 bit work best, ones higher and lower skip sometimes(dont worry, most mp3's are 128 bit to start out with"
4,Was awesome.... back in the day =D,"I played this game in the middish 90's I think and absolutely loved it, however it is so dated now I imagine you will have to get some secondary program to help run this relic. I really enjoyed all the characters and the weird spell system where you had to discover spells pretty much through trial and error. First person RPG's still live but I feel many of them fail to capture the fun the older ones had."
1,Just get the original,"Having completed the first Dungeon Master game, I was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly, Dungeon Master 2 was a disaster. The game designers stupidly decided that a sequel should be a hundred times more difficult than its predecessor. The result is a game that's so aggravatingly hard and frustrating that even professional game reviewers gave up trying to play it. In desperation, the distributor started including a hint book with the game in order to undo some of the damage. But I hear that the games is absolute murder even *with* a hint book."
3,Still reading,It was the opportunity to read comments from one of Custer's serving officers that attracted me to this book. I am finding it rather long winded and full of name dropping of persons that I have never heard of but would be of interest to families.It is not really holding my interest but I will continue in the hope of learning something interesting about a man whose reputation is less that inspirational.
2,Underwhelmed,"I had good expectations for this book, and the opening was promising, but I wish had bought and read a different book.Gold does well to hook the reader with a vivid magic scene involving the Devil, a dismembered President Harding, and a carved open live lion; all fantastical and compelling. But then the book loses stride for about 400 pages until it reaches it's equally hyper-spectacular ending. Boffo!When Carter isn't performing magic, his character is tedious and naive. Other surrounding characters are two-dimensional and introduced in overly coincidental and unrealistic ways. The only supporting character that I became attached to was Agent Griffin; he had my sympathy as a man the world was leaving behind, but in the end he was just another player thrown on stage for the big finale. Voila!..."
3,"Interesting, but a bit too ambitious for its own good","It was great to step back in time to the 1920s and 30s of San Francisco and Oakland. Gold does a great job of capturing that era and that is where the book works best. He also brings the reader into the world of magic's Golden Age and that is also a strong point. Unfortunately, the long middle section of the book bogs down. The cloak-and-dagger hi-jinks didn't seem expecially suspenseful or interesting to me -- I just wanted to get back to the stuff about magic and theater! Fortunately, Gold finds his way again at the end. I just wish the middle 150 pages had been condensed a bit. Nonetheless, this is a fun read if you like historical fiction or are interested in the vaudeville era."
2,Critical Acclaim Misleading!,"Even with the vast amount of historical and autobiographical sources Gold consulted for this novel, it is surprisingly flat. At the end of the novel, the reader realizes that Gold has failed to provide any real motivation or personality for his major characters. It's not that it's terrible, it's just neither particularly entertaining nor enlightening. Given the subject matter of magic in the early part of the 20th century, shouldn't Gold have come up with something more interesting and surprising? It almost amazes me how boring this book can be at times. Perhaps the autobiography of the real Charles Carter used by Gold in writing this novel would be a better read.I'm afraid that readers of this novel have been duped by positive press."
3,Inconsistant,"This book had great potential. At times it lived up to that potential, but mostly it did not. Had Gold focused the story a bit more with a greater focus on Carter's loves and losses, it would have been more enjoyable. This book is about 480 pages and by the middle I was no longer looking forward to picking it up in the eveing. There were just too many detours and distractions to keep my interest for those 480 pages. It was ocassionally riviting, it just needed a bit of editing."
4,"an enjoyable, fictionalized account of a magician's life","Firstly, when reading 'Carter Beats The Devil' please remember the book is a *very* fictionalized account of Charles Carter (, the magician). Much of what is written is quite over the top, but it all seems to fit nicely with the theme of magic. Although on balance a fun read, the book is overly long, at times the reading is slow, and the tumultuous ending is somewhat of a let down. However I think people interested in early 20th century San Francisco will certainly overlook these faults and relish this book for its great capture of the city (and neighboring Oakland) of yesteryear.Bottom line: a great first book by the author, but not a great book. Still, nice for those who want a little escapism."
3,Good Period Piece,"Gold's mystery entertains and educates about America from the late 19th Century to early 20th Century. This was a time when magic and vaudeville were major forms of amusement for America. The anecdotes about famous magicians and the magic business were fascinating.Overall, I would recommend the book. I believe the character development could have been better, but this is the author's first novel and he is probably fine tuning his skills."
5,Shake the World Off Your Shoulders!,"When a news reporter asks Carter the Great why he does magic, his final, somehat evasive, reply is ""What I mean is, the world is an awful place, isn't it? Magic makes it less awful for a moment or two...If I can shake the world world off a man's shoulders, I feel better.""Glen David Gold's debut novel does exactly that, and more, for several of the best reading hours I've spent in years. The five hundred pages fly by like doves out of a hat in a novel worthy of the best of American fiction.If you like John Irving, Doctorow, or Mark Helprin at their best, Gold is their equal first time out.A wonderful, wonderful, captivating read!"
5,Gold the Great!,"Really overjoyed by this debut from a (more than just) promising author! I am a big fan of late 19th and early 20th Century magicians, so this was an easy one to pick up. Hate to make comparisons, but this book made me feel like I was living in the world of ""Kavalier and Klay"" all over again. Gold has taken me back to a place that I have never lived (does that make sense to anyone?).The mastery is really in the details, and you will find yourself going back to re-meet characters once you figure out who some of them are. I had hoped the story wouldn't end...but alas, it did. I'm supposed to pass it to one of my peers, but I think I'm going to hang onto it for a second read.BUY! BUY! BUY!"
4,Glen Gold finally graduates to center stage,"While Glen Gold may be a new name to you, those of us who live in and around Oakland have enjoyed reading his fiction in the East Bay express for years. This is a book that I was genuinely unable to put down. The pace is blistering and the detail precise but not fastidious, while the blending of history and fiction is carried off with entrancing skill. Gold tells this tale with a maniacal exuberance which only gains momentum as the show goes on. Highly recommended. A ""new"" voice that we look forward to hearing from for years to come."
2,A big disappointment,"The book has garnered good reviews for years. I have no idea why. It certainly has some clever moments, but the book is poorly written (edited?), the characters have wooden conversations, and the whole thing is overlong. I'm sorry to say: this was a waste of time."
2,Critical Acclaim Misleading!,"Even with the vast amount of historical and biographical sources Gold consulted for this novel, it is surprisingly flat. At the end of the novel, the reader realizes that Gold has failed to provide any real motivation or personality for his major characters. It's not that it's terrible, it's just neither particularly entertaining nor enlightening. Given the subject matter of magic in the early part of the 20th century, shouldn't Gold have come up with something more interesting and surprising? It almost amazes me how boring this book can be at times. Perhaps the biography of the real Charles Carter used by Gold in writing this novel would be a better read.I'm afraid that readers of this novel have been duped by positive press."
5,Perfect!,"I love love love this book. Gold's story is constantly surprising and charming. He's one of the best contemporary authors out there -- no wasted blathering. He just writes cleanly and simply and each page he creates a little moment that sticks with you. And, oh yeah, it's a sprawling swashbuckling adventure, too."
4,"Magical, Witty and Historical","This book is hard to define because just when you think it's one thing, you turn the page and it becomes something else entirely.The book is at once a historical study of the San Francisco elite of the years before the Great Depression, a political thriller complete with assasination attempts and FBI agents, a story of magic and the science behind it, a romance and a tale of a man and his family.This book is highly entertaining and given its ability to morph into something else every few pages, really keeps you interested in not just the main story arch but in the multitude of characters big and small that litter Charles Carter's life."
5,A refreshing surprise,"In desperate need of an audio book for a long and unexpected car trip, I picked up Carter Beats the Devil, unabridged, at a gas station store. It turned my tedious trip into an adventure, and when I got home one hour shy of finishing the book I was sorry to get out of the car. I love fiction in an historical setting. It felt like I was watching an old movie for the first time. I kept trying to visualize it as a film and would someday love to see it on the big screen. It's packed with action, intrigue, romance and magic. Fantastic."
5,"I Was a Skeptic, But.....This is An Excellent Book","Let me summarize things this way: I've never written a book review for ...(this website) before. This book was good enough to compel me to write and suggest that you read it, too.""Carter Beats the Devil"" was a recommendation made by Amazon, and my success rate with their recommended books is only so-so. But....this selection was outstanding. It's a page-turner, and I couldn't wait to pick the book up again each night and dive into Carter's world. It has excellent character development, and the plot has some clever twists and turns. The book does start with a bang, but it also held my interest for its duration. It's a light-hearted and positive book.In summary: I was surprised at how good this book was. If you take my suggestion, read it, and enjoy it as much as I did, my little foray into writing reviews will have been worth the time. Enjoy!"
4,Carter beats his demon(s),"This is a lovely book with something for every reader--romance, mystery, suspense, period detail, and some grounding in historical fact. Above all, however, it is a story about a man and his public triumph over personal demons--loneliness, quirkiness, abuse and abandonment (a tad, at least), and the need to follow his own lights rather than his father's expectations. It is a sweet and touching book, a tale of an awkward and innocent genius. There are a lot of allegorical subtext things going on about the nature and magic of writing too, but save that for the academicians. This is a pleasant, leisurely read with a few passages of breathless suspense and a kicker ending, also some wholesome sex and not too grisly violence--the perfect book for long fall afternoons."
3,Carter Beats the Devil,"If you liked the DaVinci Code, you'll enjoy this entertaining murder mystery. The similarities include writing style, focus on an underworld plot, and historical context. And like the DaVinci Code, this book is shallow, with constant action and introductions of new characters to make up for the lack of character development, depth of story, and insightful observations about the human condition. Gold makes valiant, but unconvincing attempts to hit these marks. The book is entertaining fare, but one that'll get forever lost amongst all the other millions of new escapist novels piling up on top of it within a few years."
1,"Slick Marketing, Poor Writing","Hyperion's marketing department is brilliant. The same cannot be said for the actual text of the novel. Don't be fooled by the very appealing cover artwork and full color reproductions of vintage posters included at the beginning of each chapter. Despite Gold's apparently extensive research into the real Charles Carter and into the era, his novel lacks insight into either. Amazingly boring in stretches for a novel about a magician. The only real magic about this novel is that it became a bestseller."
2,Don't bother,"I am usually a sucker for a book cover, so I figured this HAD to be good. I haven't finished the book yet and I'm not sure that I will. The most descriptive word I can use is uneven. Some parts of the story are interesting (Carter outfoxes Mysterioso & meets Houdini), and other parts are dead boring (a young Carter & his brother are left to fend for themselves for days & the Secret Service agent's background). So far I have found it neither thrilling, nor suspenseful."
2,I tried,"I normally read non-fiction. Politics, science, and environmental policy are my usual fare. I mention this so you know that I am quite comfortable investing in and reading through relatively dry, boring material.Having said that, I could not bring myself to finish Carter Beats the Devil. I started reading it on a flight between San Francisco and Portland, and tried, really, really tried, to continue it once I got home.I couldn't.This book meanders aimlessly through a plot and introduces characters I couldn't bring myself to care about. I made it just beyond where Carter visits his adult brother and to the murder in...in...where was it again?Who knows? Certainly not me.I stuck it on the shelf and cracked open Al Gore's The Assault on Reason.Ah...much better.I must admit - I'm puzzled by the glowing reviews of Carter Beats the Devil. I'm surprised anyone would rate this book highly."
3,Why put historical figures in fantasy situations?,"This book is an odd mix of melodrama and historical events. Parts of it don't make sense (the kidnapping by the Feds - are they trying to kill him or not?), and other parts are pure whimsy, leaving me to wonder how much is true and how much was invented by this writer who seems to have learned too much about plotting from Saturday matinee serials.Real people - Carter, Houdini, President Harding, Philo Farnsworth - are thrown in with fictional constructs like the evil magician, the earnest cop, and so on. I'd have rather Gold made up all his characters, or stuck to reality. The ""Golly Gosh Wow"" story feels contrived, even though the presentation of the color and detail of period magic displays is intriguing.Carter is great fun to read. It just pissed me off."
1,Soap Opera,This was an over-researched historical fiction soap opera. I would have given up on it long before finishing it if it weren't for strange circumstances that don't need and can't really be explained.
2,Disjointed and thready,"It seems as if Mr. Gold was uncertain just which book he wanted to write. All the espionage and intrigue surrounding the death of President Harding in the midst of the Tea Pot Dome scandal, or the story of a Houdini wannabe. This may have made two very good books, but as one book it never created a tapestry that wove the two stories together, the way The Carpetbaggers did. I found myself skipping around trying to get into it and never did. The characters were kind of one dimensional and the dialouge was too cheeky even for that era. The best aspect of this book was the colorful cover and the fantastic promotional ad campaign that launched it onto the Best Sellers list, but this 500 page epic was a job-and-a-half to read."
5,Outstanding Entertainment!,"I picked this up without knowing anything about it because the cover grabbed my eye. I've always enjoyed magic, but I don't think you have to be a magic junkie to really enjoy this book. Has a GREAT story, great characters, with continual surprises. I can't recommend highly enough."
2,James needed to rein in his pen,"This is the best of the three books in the ""Uncle Bill"" trilogy, if only because it was infused with all of the action missing from the first two installments. Scootie and Kip arrive in Montana for their third summer-long visit on their uncle Frank's Five Barb Ranch, only to discover that Frank and Bill plan to leave them in town while they move a newly acquired herd of bulls to the ranch. The kids are adamant against staying in town any longer than necessary, and the men finally relent to letting them tag along.But the one-night trip they had planned is interrupted by severe rain storm, during which Kip and several of bulls are separated from the main group, the creek floods, Bill is washed downstream, and the kids barely escape becoming lion chow.Much to the story's detriment, James's once again failed to rein in his pen, and the result is several pointless chapters tacked on at the end. Other than that, the book's only flaw is an inherently weak premise."
4,Good book on BGP and Multicasting,"They say sequels are never better than the original. This may be somewhat true for this book. This is a VERY GOOD book. It's just that it's not as good as the first volume. Still head and shoulders above the rest. BGP examples are clear and concise. It doesn't go into detail like Halabi's book however.If Doyle never wrote Vol I, this book (Vol II) would definitely get a 5 star rating from me."
3,IT could have been better,"This book is a diaspointment from Doyle's Routing TCP/IP Volume I.This book is purely for beginners. All the topic in this book can be found in BGP Case Studies from Cisco web site. It's more for Enterprise Networks, not for ISPs. The author should provide more details, explanations, examples on BGP Filtering, Attributes, specially regular expressions. The book covers only the basics."
2,To technical for me.,I found thias book way to technical for me. I found his method of writing hard to stick with. I'm sure a doctor would find it interesting but for us regular folks it is hard reading. I had to stop reading about a third of the way through.
5,Outstanding Study,"This is to my knowledge, the best and most comprehensive study I have had the pleasure to obtain. Dr. Stevenson has devoted his life to this study. In my opinion, this book will convince anyone who seriously studies reincarnation that it is in fact a proven science. This book changed my life and I regret that it took me so long to find it.Thank you Dr. Stevenson"
2,Not that happy!,The medical terminology audio does not spell the word it is pronouncing which makes it hard to visualize the word.
2,Early in the Program,"There is some interesting background on the program included in this video but it ends around 1985. The title of the video would be better named, ""The Early Years"". Much of the important history of the shuttle is missing."
2,Cut,"The copy I got was the cut version. I know because I remember the naughty bits from this movie from back when. But every time anything started it went to the next scene. Virtually no nudity in my copy. A shame, I really like Kim Yates."
2,A Seduction of The Most Dangerous Kind.,"When Chani, a beautiful model, joins a group of friends sharing a Malibu estate, inhibitions are quickly set aside. Chani has a body to die for, but it's her limitless desire to explore forbidden pleasures that her hosts find irresistible. Sarah has an attractive fiancé, but late-night skinny-dipping with Chani opens a new world of possibilities to her. Nick loves Sarah, but can he resist the new girl? Matt, a professional photographer, isn't about to even try. Chani wants to be shot in the nude and what happens from there is simply unavoidable.Chani is about to provide some real excitement...but sexual exploration comes at a price."
1,Put that dog to sleep,"Although Stray Dogs is a quick read it only makes it slightly less painful. It was dull, all the charaters are static. The main character, John (named after the author?) makes it known that he uses all people, from ex-girlfriends to the poor sap at the train ticket office. Yet he still expects the readers sympathy. Very predictable plot and ending."
3,Stray Dogs=U Turn Screeenplay,"This book reads like a screenplay. No it is a screenplay, as Ridley is more a screenwriter than novelist. It's a quick noir thriller with some good insights into human nature. A cool story that reads in a short afternoon.The book and the movie are so similar that there's not much point in checking out the book if you've seen the movie.Overall, Ollie Stone did a good job of bringing this pulp to celluloid."
4,BETTER BOOK THAN THE NEW MOVIE U-TURN,"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT. JOHN RIDLEY IS A GREAT AUTHOR, AND IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE U-TURN, WHICH WAS BASED ON STRAY DOGS, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN IDIOT DIRECTOR OLIVER STONE IS. OLIVER STONE DIRECTED THE MOVIE U-TURN, AND COMPLETLEY CHANGED THE BOOK AROUND. THANK GOD I READ THE BOOK FIRST. IF I SAW THE MOVIE FIRST THE BOOK WOULDENT SEEM ALL THAT TEMPTING"
3,"entertaining, at best","There were some quirky characters, but other than that, this book is pretty bland. After a while, nothing comes as a surprise. The main character is totally unappealing. No point to it."
5,Stray Dogs is a must read!,"I followed the journey in one sitting. Stray Dogs combines suspense, lust, greed and wit in one fantastic story"
2,Review of Caring for your Aging Parents,"This book has worthwhile information. However, since it was published in 1992, some of the contact information has changed."
4,The Original Robot,So many animated movies are based on 60s shows. Before there was a Lion King there Kimba. Before there was Iron Giant there was Gigantor--bigger than big :) This is great stuff and brings back memories of sitting in front of the B/W TV drinking chocolate milk.
2,average,"none of these songs are outstanding, although each has its respective charms on this interesting debut from the former verve frontman. the a-side is an affecting if slightly overproduced pop ballad; the b-sides are both overlong but individually appealing. 'could be (a country thing city thing blues thing)' overcomes its unweildy title with a luscious minor-key melody, but its extended fade-out is indulgent. and the closer, 'precious stone', is little more than an unstructured re-write of the verve number, 'gravity grave'."
2,Didn't like it much,"It looks great but when I got it, the tubes were stuck together. It is also built kinda cheesy and I wasn't at all impressed with it once I got it. I returned it and am looking for something else."
1,When Pan isnt really Pan and Support offers no Support,"The specs for this camera say that it has Pan/Tilt and Zoom. The tilt works good. The zoom is digital vs optical but the low quality digital zoom is expected for a camera in this price range. The Pan does not work UNLESS you are zoomed in, then it Digitally Pans the view. So I guess it could be called Pan but not really. It does make panning ultra quiet though :-) Before I figured this out I emailed Panasonic. I got a reply back several days later saying that I should be getting a reply on my question about this camera's pan function from the camera support group and was encourages to rate my satisfaction with the support that I havent received yet. When Panasonic support did email me, they simply said the camera does not have Pan and closed the trouble ticket."
3,"Great smell, kinda beat up.","The candles have a great sent, and a nice variation on color. When arrived they were a little beat up, even though they were in bubble wrap. They were also a little smaller than the picture lead me to believe."
4,Nicely packaged but smaller than it may appear.,"Item is very nice, but it is good to note that the candles are votive-sized as opposed to the pillar-size that they may appear in the picture. Very good quality candles, but could be a little pricey for certain shoppers."
1,The Omega Man,"Charlton Heston was always a one dimensional and overrated actor. The Omega Man is a cheesy movie. The dialogue awful & the production is really bad. I've seen better special effects in some 1950s sci-fi movies! I guess it's okay to watch it one time, but no more than that."
2,Overated,I bought this looking for a new experience in Sci-Fi and this got great reviews. It is hopelessly dated and not entertaining at all. I am giving this two stars on the basis that the DVDs played and it had a good premise. The premise could've been developed further into an interesting story.
1,False Advertising,"Buyer beware. The flash page intices you with the prospect of receiving The Quatermass Experiment (The Creeping Unknown), 1956 - in addition to the 1979 TV version, Quatermass. Forget about it. Shameful false advertising. Amazon: take down the false advertising. Have you no shame."
1,Rather boring...,"I found this film a bit dull. The actors seened tired and the dialogue is stilted and stagey. It's no Dr. Who. What a disappointment, I think I'll seel mine."
4,good price good product,"arrived on time, just as described. I could have used a little longer, but that was my fault. Would use again."
4,ball bungees are great!,Exactly what I ordered and delivered in specified time. I use these to secure a number of things and they work almost as good as Duck Tape!!
4,Overall great book,"I found this book very helpful. It is very good at explaining in words and pictures how to read your cats body language so you can have a happier cat. I work in an animal shelter and found many of the tips to work great. The reason it only gets 4 stars is because I don't agree with some of the ""punishment"" tips like spraying cat with water or tapping it on the nose. Most of the sources I have found say those are the worst ways to try and change cat behavior. But the rest of the book really was great."
3,"Informative, but lacking first person insights.","I am glad I read this book--for the most part it provided what I was after. It gives a good overview of Gypsie history from what is thought to be their beginnings to the present. I was disapointed that Gypsie migration to the US is only briefly mentioned, with nothing on the status of contemporary Gypsie life here. I was very disapointed that the author could not personalize what the Gypsies went through. I realize that due to the high levels of Gypsie illiteracy, there may not be much in the way of journals, etc. However, something could have been done to personalize their experience. For instance, the author goes in to too much detail about laws enacted by European Countries to deal with Gypsies, but does not discuss how these harsh laws affected them personally. I know more about Gypsies as a group, but nothing about them as individuals."
5,MY FAVORITE SOURCE FOR RESEARCHING THE ROM,"Since most of my research involved ancient Rom culture, it became overly apparent that most sources were very slanted by their authors and times. Also it was hard to get many illustrations or pictures from back then.Not so here. The entire book is a great overview of Gypsy history during ancient times. There are maps, woodcuttings, tapestries, pictures of all sorts as well as a wonderful ammount of information--definitely a must for a great overview when researching the Roma from the start."
3,voting,"it contains too much theory, but it doesn`t help me, because I wanted to install and make it works. But in this case it is not usefull."
5,An important work,"I am a clinical psychologist, and in my list of favorite books, I write this:Diamond writes: ""The volatile emotions of anger and rage have been broadly `demonized,' vilified, maligned, and rejected as purely pathological, negative impulses with no real redeeming qualities. As a result, most `respectable' Americans habitually suppress, repress, or deny their anger-inadvertently rendering it doubly dangerous."" He also clarifies, while developing the ideas of Rollo May, how we therapists collude with our clients and culture, thus depriving ourselves of the value and resources of this normal dimension of our being. He integrates psychoanalytic, Jungian, and existential theory under a new rubric of Existential Depth Psychology. As May states, our job is often ""not to still the daimons but to wake them.""In addition, I think this is an important, engaging, and well-written work that I wish all my colleagues would read."
2,totally failed after 2 years...,"This drive was easy to install and did work great when it was new, but after about 1 year having it, it wouldn't eject CDs unless I held the door on the front open for it. This drive has also made many faulty CDs which didn't work and were wasted. After 2 years of having it just broke down all together. When I turn on the computer it makes all sorts of wierd sounds and the lights flash randomly and everything. Luckily I was thinking of buying a faster DVD/CD-RW Combo drive anyway. I wouldn't reccomend it for any longer term use or for anyone who expects dependability from it."
3,Difficult but very informative,"I used this book for the first time at college. It is a rather difficult book, the assignments are very detailed and indepth. I love the fact that this book has so many drawings, they help a lot in understanding the assignment. Creating tables is the best section."
1,"don't try to look for the melody,","just stay away from it as far as you could. anything with the cardboard-like leon lai san would be a disaster, albeit he was used as a clueless supporting role in this deadbeat hongkong mtv musical. it tried to give you a melody looking, but turned out the melody was nowhere to be looked. just use your ipod to block and stay away from this deadbeat."
5,"Artistic, Passionate, Lovely...","This song may well be the most amazing song ever written. I will disagree with the first reviewer; this song isn't an adult love song. It takes from the depths of the human soul and turns it into music that's essence is bittersweet, passionate emotion. It holds a beauty that no song on the radio could compare.I am 13 years old. Admittedely, I am not your average teenybopper. I am a composer of both poetry and classical music. This song has touched my soul. I believe it can and will penetrate the hearts of not only adults, but of teenagers and even children. The soul belongs to everyone."
4,Great horse!,"My daughter has this horse and she loves it. It is great, very realistic and well proportioned. She likes it much better than the American girl doll equivalent. The saddle and extra items which are all made of plastic have held up well even to the rabbits nibbles on it.However I am stunned by the price the 'littlestoreontheinternet' is selling it for. My daughter bought it with the money she saved for $30 from Target and here it is going for $199. I thought it an error until I really took a look at their store front. This horse is not worth that much!! Nor any of the our generation items."
4,Victors,I enjoy all Stephen Ambrose books. They are well written and a joy to read. Thanks to Amazon for providing this service.
3,It's an OK product,I have had this product to get along with my motorola razor. It works fine I wouldnt say its the best but then it does the job.
1,Lost it 2 days after i bought it,"I couldn't keep it on my ear it didn't hook on very well and I lost it like two days after I started using it. I am switching to a motorola device, a bluetooth speaker that clips on to my car and is hands free."
3,Different but Decent,"Not at captivating as I had hoped, although it's a fresh voice... not many other places you'll hear a rapper drop rhymes about his video game library... For now, Del's a novelty, although one gets the feeling he has the talent to break out like he did on his work with The Gorillaz. Check back in a couple of years."
2,Not too impressed,"Ive had this album for a week now, and have been listening quite frequently. I haven't been too impressed.Basically, If you want music with really complex lyrics and excellent rhymes that make you think, and don't really mind simple beats and bad choruses. then you should definately consider this album..That pretty much says it all..."
2,DEL'S WORST,"I am a huge fan of Deltron 3030 and Third Eye Vision, but this cd is weak. It lacks the vibe of other del albums. ""Style police"" and ""Jaw gymnastics"" are solid songs, but thats pretty much it."
1,DEL THA WACKEST HOMOSAPIEN,"del is the wackest mc in the biz, even wacker than nelly or anybody on the cash money label. his rhymes are 'cat' and 'hat', nothing special. if you wanna hear real flow, check out company flow, jedi mind tricks, common, or almost anybody from the underground. these words are recycled, trash, BASURA. don't waste the eyepower it takes to look at the cover of this garbage.don't say i didn't warn you."
4,Worth The Wait,"This album took forever to come out, but it was worth the wait. Del once again proves that he is one of the most underrated MC's out there. The production has a futuristic feel and isn't bad at all. Del did most of the production himself, but the guest producers (Prince Paul, El-P, Domino, Casual, etc.) stand out. While there are many excellent tracks such as the humorous ""If You Must..."" and the El-P-produced ""Offspring"", the tracks ""Catch All This"" and the A-Plus-produced ""Stay On Your Toes"" fail due to terrible beats. Overall, if you want lyrics, you should look no further than Both Sides Of The Brain."
4,If Only More Rappers Used As Much of Their Brain...,"A much awaited release from the video-game playing emcee from Oakland. Not surprisingly this is one of the few emcees that hasn't fallen off creatively. The album on a whole features Del's ability to tell comical, yet realistic stories that DO have a point. Of course, no Del album would be complete without appropriate disses going out to the wack emcees out there who so deservingly need them. An lyrical and musical work of abstract genius that is true to form for this Hieroglyphics frontman and West Coast pioneer."
5,"del is back, intact and better than ever","i had been waiting impatiently since august of 1999 for the release of del's 4th album. it kept getting delayed until finally a release date was assured for april 2000. now that it's finally out, everyone can hear why del is one of the best, most creative, original mcs out today. The variety of songs on 'both sides' is very refreshing and it was quite a pleasure to hear del's own beats with hardly a sample to be heard. this is on par with album's already released this year by mos def and blackalicious. not to be missed."
4,This album is not to be slept on,"If you are a Del/Hieroglyphics fan, then you already have this album. Everyone else should buy this album. 17 Incredi-tight tracks and not just about your usual thugs, playas, and ballas. Everything from personal hygiene to video games to hip hop fandom to conspiracy theories get rhymed about. A refreshing departure from the same-old, same-old..."
3,"Lyrically great, needs more production variety.","I am a huge Del fan and had been waiting forever for this album to drop. The first three tracks left me speachless - everything I expected and more (especially Jaw Gymnastics). But I feel that the middle of the album is for the most part weak. Del comes off strong as ever, but the production gets old and monotonous. I think some of the stronger moments come when someone other than Del produces the tracks. However, the disc pulls itself around by the end, and Del is hitting as good as he did on ""No Need for Alarm"" once more. Over-all, it's definitely worth purchasing, but be prepared for some filler in the middle of the album."
3,Not the Best Del,"Based on the reviews I thought this CD would be more than what it was. Del really only hits the mark on 3-5 songs, the first 2 and Proto Kulture being the best. Otherwise he seems to be just off the beat and kind of sloppy. If I knew what I knew now I would have just picked up the mp3's for those 3-5 songs."
5,Hiphop excelence,"Both sides of the brain is an amazing hiphop album, not only is it fresh and orginal it has some of the best lyricism from del and any other emcee. The album has a very unique style of production that may take some less experimental listeners a few listens to get into but after that the album really shines and shows its unique take on hiphop. dels got some of his best ryhmes on this album with his amazing flow and poweful voice. every song on the album is awesome to listen to and there is only one song where the album even remotely lags, a great tribute to hiphop and a must have for hiphop fans"
4,Its exellent,"Well, If i had never heard any other stuff by DEl befor i would think this CD is hella tight and it is but not his best. This CD is half a winner and half a just ok. Some songs are kinda boring and can't listen to them more that a few times but some songs are masterful. The songs that are good are so good that it makes this album worth the money. Songs #'s 1,4,5,9,10,11,17 are Delphonic classics. So get this if you are a hiero head or never heard Del befor. Peace"
1,Don't waste your money,I read the reviews and people must have been paid to write such good things about this product. It was horrible since the first use. It was bought for me so I did not have the receipt and I decided to buy another to see if the first was faulty. The second was just as bad so I returned it. The reception is lousy and come in and out-NOT VERY SAFE! It also interferes with many other monitors out there. Don't waste your money!!!!
4,Still Not Sure,"I had to add a review because a previous reviewer complained that the identity of the survivor was revealed too quickly. I finished the book several days ago, and I'm still not sure if it was Shelby or Jimmy. That being left in question was the second surprise of the book. The first was plunging into a Jodi Thomas book and finding myself in a contemporary story rather than a tale of the old west. A real change for her, but VERY interesting."
3,not expected,it was a here and there kind of book seemed forever to grasp my interest just wasnt what I had expected from a Jodi Thomas Book
4,Riveting from start to finish!,"One of my writer pals recommended this book to me as an excellent example of writing from mutiple points of view; it was that and a great story, too. The tale of five women from very different backgrounds who find themselves thrown together when their husbands are killed in an oil rigging accident, this book has a lot to say about the idiocy of making assumptions about people we don't know, the value of female friendship, and finding love in unlikely places. I was hooked after just a few sentences and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to reach the highly satisfying conclusion. This was my first Jodi Thomas novel but it definitely won't be my last!"
5,Perfect gift for the older couple,"""What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility"" (Tolstoy). Those of us who venture into matrimony later in life bring with us a particularly rich store of potential incompatibility. If nothing else, we've simply had more time to get stuck in our ways and habits of thinking. This book is a helpful series of reflections, from a married couple who's been there, on some of the unique challenges of blending two lives later in the game. The authors give us lots of practical and insightful advice, but the real value of the book is the intimate glimpses we're offered from the everyday lives of approximately 70 survey respondents: couples just like us, learning new routines for handling money, schedules, living spaces, multiple careers, blended families... A thoughtful wedding gift for the older couple who probably already has two of everything."
4,Great starter Yoga tape for pregnancy,I really enjoyed this DVD. The Yoga seems deceivingly easy but I definitely felt the effects the next day in a good way. It is a great starter for wanting to start yoga without any experience. They also are very conscious and aware of the needs of pregnant woman by telling you to go at your own pace when needed. I highly recommend this one.
5,best ever ... great for your pregnancy,"I bought a couple of Yoga pregnancy DVDs. This is by far the best. If you have done sport before the exercises are easy. The look and feel is very clean, the voice friendly and calm.Highly recommend this ... and the one for more advanced. Both great."
2,Boring if you've EVER done yoga before,"I've done yoga off and on over the past few years, but would not consider myself advanced in any way. I mostly practice at home every few months with a dvd.I thought this would be a good relaxation method during pregnancy, but found myself bored stiff and had to stop doing to dvd halfway through. I much preferred:Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor and Birth with Colette Crawford orElement: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga.Both of which are VERY easy for beginners but seemed both more engaging (I felt stretched and more flexible afterwards) as well as more relaxing, since I wasn't looking at the clock every 10 seconds wondering when it would be over."
3,Not for a beginner,I was not impressed by this video. I have never tried Yoga and this video is not for a beginner. Some of the moves that she does isn't something I can do 1 while I am pregnant and 2 as a beginner.
4,Cool hit,This song pure shores is very beautiful the instruments are very interesting and I love the way they sing. In the background you can here the sounds of the shore and the chorus is very musical and the words are interesting. It is not a good song to dance to. I think it is a nice song for anyone who likes to sit and listen to a calm song although it is slow it has a very strong lovely beat.
3,Quite dated but retains some value,"Although Auletta often displays a sprightly prose style, this book is sadly dated. This is good magazine journalism, that's all -- not a collection of personal essays with a distinctive voice. The reader often feels as if he is reading a three-year-old issue of the New Yorker, which is probably what he is doing.Backstory does have the ironic virtue of freezing for all time some of the ephemeral visions of the brief dot-com era. The chapter on Inside.com, where all too much good money was chasing all too many bad ideas, is worth the book's cover price. The media and business worlds have moved on since then, for better and for worse, but one can occasionally find some pleasure in recalling the ""next big thing"" as perceived in the year 2000."
3,Pathetic Snickering,"If you are who the other one says you are, I'd beg YOU BOTH to remember that you're fortunate to EVEN HAVE BOOKS PUBLISHED. For every two of you, there are thousands of others who put their hearts and souls into their writing and never make a dime. Get some perspective and grow up!"
5,A cheap and good product,"It had been delievered within time expected. I put a computer side jack to PC speaker's output for headphone, and plug right and left audio jacks to my audio component. This work enhanced the quality of audio sounds by coming out the sound to two bigger speakers separated. I would recommend this adapter to somone who want to enhance PC audio quality (not to cutting edge stage but to general audio component level) within the lowest budget.Thank you for your business"
2,Disappointed by the quality,"This chair was very comfortable and the concept is good. However, we bought two of them and both of them broke after only being used a few times."
1,Outdated,While more professionally produced than other texts on the subject this book is very outdated.
1,Too old. Author has new book to replace this one.,Amazon should take this book off line. It is real old and does not reflect today's karting in the US and specily abroad.
1,Beginner's Complete Karting Guide,"i wish i had burned the money rather than buy this book at least i would have been warm for a sec, this book just plain out sucks,its so out of date you might as well race a wagon when the author does spend a moment on something he fails to give you enough details, deals mostly with 2 cycle, there is a very short second on 4 cycle, deals again mostly on road course not dirt tracks, does a negetive -2 help"
4,Not so hot,"This was a gift for my Dad, nothing is ever hot enough for him, so I was on a mission to find something that might make him sweat. The name on this is what sold me on it, unfortunatly, it didn't do the trick on Dad. He did enjoy the taste, just not hot enough for him."
5,Superb!!!,"Bogert, Appice and McCarty ... wow, what a powerhouse!! If you're at all curious about this album, just buy it. You won't be sorry."
4,Correction of details,Jim McCarty of Cactus is not from the Yardbirds. He was in Mitch Ryder's Detroit Wheels and Detroit. He also helped form the great Rockets. He's still jamming in the Detroit rock and blues scene.
2,Cactus will be crushed.,"I hate to be the guy that posts a negitive review, but here goes... Cactus may be a great band with the perfect ingredients, but I feel it doesn't work. The song writing and the recording really bring the whole project down. I bought every Cactus LP when they first came out and there only seems to be a hand full of songs that I would come back to on each LP. Perhaps the anthology would be the place to start for new listeners. I've heard Cactus compared to Led Zep, no chance! Just compare LZs first LP and this LP.... Cactus will be crushed- no creativity, low quality, and no sparks."
4,The old Cactus,"Haven't heard this in years. The playing is great , but I don't particularly like Rusty's singing and harp playing anymore now than I did in 1970. By the way, I believe the description by Amazon.com is a little inaccurate, as Jim McCarty of Cactus and Jim McCarty of the Yardbirds were not the same people. At the time the Yardbirds were together, this Jim McCarty, if I am not mistaken, was playing with Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, and is responsible for the scorching solos on ""Devil in a Blue Dress."""
4,Raw Cactus - Good Ol' Sweaty Blues Rock,"One of the best rhythm sections in rock history (Bogert & Appice). This debut 70' album from Cactus is a classic and is highly recommended. This is raw high powered blues, R&B influenced hard rock. Whether you're a Vanilla Fudge fan or not (I am), you cannot but appreciate the musicianship and there are a few solid songs on this album. This was not released on Atlantic (Atco) records domestically on CD. Thankfully for this import, we have a high quality reissue to crank up, LOUD!"
3,Buy it on sale.,"This is not the cool first season, but if you get it at a discount, then it's ok. The cheaper the price, the more it's nice."
4,Enchanting CD,"Following in the fine tradition of the Celtic Women CD, this arrangement of some of the finest Celtic female musicians is beautifully organized with some amazing songs.The CD features a good mix of Gaelic and English songs. To me the Gaelic songs are wonderful. It has opened my mind to a whole new area of music. (I previously didn't like music where I couldn't understand the words). But this is incredible. In fact I thought the Gaelic songs on this CD were better than the Celtic Women CD.This CD is a perfect introduction into artists that those outside of Europe may never have the chance to experience.The CD is highlighted by:Jenny Schaubs - This Piece of Earth;Hoireann 0 by Talitha MacKenizie;I am going to the west - Connie DoverOnly a few songs were disappointing, including Sinead O'Connor's version of He moved through the fair, which pales by comparison to Lorrena McKennitt's versions.Not experienced this type of music and are adventurous, buy it!"
3,"Not Close to ""Celtic Woman""","I followed the leaders. Saw what other Celtic music fans were buying too & ordered this in conjunction with ""Celtic Woman 2"". I was fairly disappointed. I think before I go buying more Celtic music I'll try hearing the CDs in person first."
5,What a bargain!,This bottle is HUGE. Great price. I thought I was paying that much for a smaller bottle so I was pleasantly surprised.
4,BEWARE OF EXCESSIVE SHIPPING FEES!!!,"The shipping costs were almost equal to the cost of the product. I understand there is a cost involved, but this was a insult."
4,A good workshop manual for a VW Beetle owner,"I have owned My copy of Chilton's VW Beetle repair manual for a few years, and in fact I was just reading it a few hours ago, as I have a problem with My beetles carburetor and was looking at the very ineresting diagrams of the carburetors in this book. Best diagrams I've seen. They do show how the fuel enters the carburetor and how it sprays out of jets when idling and when accelerating . It also shows how to adjust and replace many items.Very informative and covers many subjects. You can't have too many VW workshop manuals, and I recommend this one if Your car is before the 1968 model. I bought mine thru amazon.com"
3,A Christmas Gift For Mother,"Bought this as a gift for my elderly mother who likes chocolate covered pretzels and peanut brittle. Came well packaged with no damage to gift boxes. Gift boxes are shrink wrapped,so I expect the freshness to be good when she opens them.Update 12/26/12: Gave the gift boxes of peanut brittle and chocolate covered pretzels to my mom yesterday. My mom is somewhat a connoisseur when it comes to peanut brittle,that's her favorite snack. She liked the chocolate covered pretzels,but when it came to the peanut brittle it lacked many peanuts and in her words,tasted like dollar store quality. I personally don't like peanut brittle,so I can't comment on that,but thought the pretzels were fresh tasting. I would rate this product for the prezels and their freshness at 3 1/2 stars."
2,Good deal,Its a good cd. It has good songs in there but the good ones are 808 and bring it all to me.
3,"It's not excellent, but it's o.k","The CD is good, but only if you have heard the whole original CD and only liked this song. If you haven't had a chance to listen to the original CD do so, cause there are a few good songs apart from the ""bring it all to me"" one, and maybe you'll save money buying 1 now instead of buying 2 later. END"
3,Good...,"Several good ideas in this book on marketing strategies for smaller companies; that made the book worth reading. The author spent too much time on the discussion of Judo. The book contains some memorable phases such as ""Don't moon the giant"", which would have been good advice for Netscape to follow. Great discussion on how to use a large company's strengths against it."
5,Love it!,"Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon."
2,it is JUST ok.....,"It seems cute enough and I thought it was good.Although, it really is not keeping my 4 year olddaughter's attention. She gets bored with it reallyvery quickly! ...and that's usually not the case withmany other dvd's she watches. So, I really wishI hadn't purchased this one."
5,The best iSeries book ever!,Did you ever wonder about why IBM is pushing JAVA? Worried about the future of the AS/400? Concerned about personal computers or PC servers that have faster cpu speeds than an iSeries? You must read this book then! Only Frank Soltis could provide the highly readable in depth analysis of the internal architecture that appears to becoming the basis for the entire eServer line of computers to be built by IBM in the future.For many of us who have invested heavily in the AS/400 and are worried about its future this book should put those fears to rest and demonstrate clearly how this amazing machine and its even more incredible layered operating system will be the basis for IBM's future!Bob C.
4,very interesting,"if you love sports, and want to know how those great teams keep on winning, this is your book. i learned a lot about what people dont see in the team; the manager's dedicated work to keep the team victorious. overall, it was a very interesting book, i recommend it to everybody."
2,Incomplete tale,"This collection is not nearly so good as two others--The Revolutionary War narrated by Charles Kuralt, and The Revolution which is a 13 part series also by the History channel. After watching those, I found this set missing many key details in the others. I recommend those to you instead."
4,Great program,"I purchased this CD set for many reasons and happy to report that the ""Discovery"" channel has done a great job on these video's.As a member of the Colorado Society of Son's of the American Revolution,I give a 4 star review.Charles"
3,"Good information presented, but lacks cinematic conviction","If you have seen Washington the Warrior or the Washington's Generals programs, watching this series will be very difficult to follow and will be disappointing. Unlike Washington the Warrior, this DVD is not in high definition and does not have a powerful soundtrack. In fact the video quality is so poor that it looks like someone dubbed it from VHS. The information presented is good if you're able to stay awake, but it lacks the cinematic conviction that A&E/History Channel is known for producing. If you're into American Revolutionary History, you may want to look for other video's/series on the subject."
2,Not bad but still disappointing,"The rewriting of American history which commenced by New England historians in 1865 was not just a moral whitewash for the war just completed. They went back to the origins of the Republic and refashioned the Revolutionary War as well. What people seem to forget is that while the conflict began in the north, the British defeats that led to surrender occurred in the South. Yorktown was the logical consequence of wounds inflicted first by ""partisans"" (as they were called) along the Santee and PeeDee rivers in SC.While the VHS series is quite good (and I do recommend) this truncation which perpetuates the notion of the south as a sideshow is not corrected. The contributions of Marion, Horry, Sumter and even Greene do not depict the real turning point. In reality more battles took place in SC than any other colony. The best documentary has yet to be created."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Written on an elementary level, and provides no insightful information past what you learn in Middle School. I was hoping for something on the level of ""The World At War"" or ""The Civil War."" Instead, I got ""Schoolhouse Rock"" without the good music."
5,perfect service,"I actually ordered the incorrect battery and before I could return it, the company had the correct battery sitting in my mailbox. I wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it."
1,Problems w/ Battery,"Simply put, my Blackberry Pearl regularly shuts itself off and I must pull the battery to restart it. Never did this with the last battery but has done it since purchasing this one. I finally put the old battery back in and haven't had a problem since. Don't know the exact problem but do know that it only happens when using this battery."
5,Excellent Product,"I honestly never would have thought that I could get a quality battery for my Blackberry 8130 for $7. But I have had the battery for two weeks, swapping my spare out for my original and vice versa when one runs out of charge. I cannot really tell the difference between them. Honestly I think the one I purchased works a little better. I have had my phone since Novmeber and I would not only buy one of these spares right now, but save yourself shipping cost and buy two."
1,less than half the life of factory battery,"The original battery gave 2-3 days. Now 18 months old it was giving 6-7 hours of standby.This new battery gives the phone 24 hours on standby - tops.Worth ~$4?? I'm not sure.EDIT - AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE, this battery will not hold the charge overnight. Less than 15 hours till dead. Definitly not worth $4."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This battery looks like an actual C-M2 Blackberry (which it very well may be). If it is however, it's an old C-M2 battery that keeps about as good a charge as the one I'm replacing. Doesn't even last the day.Go elsewhere for this. I hate paying full price for things like these but you just never seem to know what you're gonna get."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"It cost $6 because it doesn't hold a charge more than a day, even if I do not use my talk time. It will do until I decide to pay $50 for a real battery."
3,Fast shipping but battery doesnt hold charge for long time!!!,"Great price and fast shipping but battery almost holds the charge for as long as the old one! I used to keep my pearl up for atleast two days on my other battery and it just ran down two barley one, so i got this one and it only gets close to two. But the service and price was great!!!"
3,Be careful with Vibeseller shipping charges,"Vibe seller states that it charges a flat $4.99 shipping charge regardless of the # of items per order. However, when you proceed to checkout, you get charged for each item instead of a flat fee. If there is a way to prevent this in the online checkout, I haven't figured it out."
1,Simply Doesn't Work,"I should have listened to all the reviews saying ""you get what you pay for"" because it's definitely the case here. Phone would only stay on if it was plugged into the charger, would not hold a charge and died as soon as it was unplugged. Even tried with a few different chargers to make sure it wasn't my charger that was broken. Nope- just an inferior battery. Very disappointing."
1,You get what you pay for.,"In spite of what it says in the product description, the batteries are not new. The one I received did not hold the charge at all, and bore signs of wear on the edges. I complained via email and received, very quickly actually, a second battery, which was not much better..."
1,When it seems too good to be true... it usually is...,"When someone tries to sell you a replacement battery for a fraction the price of what legitimate retailers charge for a new battery, you know something's going on. In my case, I bought one of these replacement batteries for a BlackBerry Pearl and it was useless. It held less of a charge than the battery I was replacing. I suspect these guys are selling used, worn-out batteries that other people have turned in for recycling, and selling them to hapless Amazon customers. Beware!"
4,works fine,"battery works well so far, came a little scuffed but holding charge fine, bought from Accessory Wizard"
4,Good Products,I got 5. They work very well. The normal charge time JUST like My BlackBerry's Original Battery
5,Just Like New,The battery came on time and appears to be an original and unused and clean. Phone works just like new. That is simply all there is to say.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,Dont waste your time with this. I use my phone moderately and the battery life still sucks. I bought this battery twice. The first time I thought it was a defective battery...second time...same results. I know its pricey but you will save yourself a lot of trouble just buying from blackberry
4,Blackberry pearl battery,Works like a charm. Once my old battery started going out i decided that it would be alot cheaper to replace the battery instead of buying a whole new phone. This battery works amazingly!!! and it shipped fast to. I highly reccomend it
1,Batteries a no show!,First they send the wrong batteries. Then tell me to send the wrong batteries back at my expense. Then 3 emails and no batteries. Avoid these guys like the plague!
1,Don't Buy,I should have listened to the reviews. This battery looks like the original one but performs exactly like the one I want to replace in the first place. The battery lasts for a day without too much talk time. I also paid too much for shipping when the battery was sent via regular mail.
1,Dont do it buy a new phone,"I was trying to save my blackberry pearl and I thought that by purchasing a new battery I would be able to. However the battery allowed the phone to turn on once, but it would not recharge. Big waste of time and money."
4,"Not OEM, but just as good!","""$6 for a battery? too good to be true?"" That's what I thought, ""but for $6, why not give it a shot?"" I'm just using it as a ""second"" battery because the Pearl 8130 has such poor battery life, I could throw this in my luggage, or whatever when I go on a trip. Well, I've been swapping back and forth between my original and this one for a few weeks now (to make sure they stay charged) and I can never tell the difference in life, they both seem to work exactly the same. The only difference is this one has a non-OEM looking sticker wrapping it, looks to be printed from a scan of an OEM."
5,A great introduction,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not only did I come to understand what a green witch was, the author also made using magic immediately accessible. Well written."
5,"Spiritually Motivating, and fun!","Motivating, Spiritual,and wonderfully entertaining, Robin awakens a persons innermost senses to Mother Earth, and the universe as a whole. For the aspiring Green Witch or even those that have traveled the Green path for years, Healing Magic proves to be a wonderful and practical guide. Based on the Wise Woman traditions, Healing Magic guides the reader through Herbal lore, Emotional and spiritual self healing, Moon Magic,and so much more. As I read Robin's book, I could feel the spiritual power that flows from her to the reader through her written word. If I could recommend a book that everyone should have for their personal library, Healing Magic would be one of my first choices."
3,"Good character description, yet lacking readability","Bambara makes you feel the characters. It was very hard to struggle through, because there aren't really and noticable plots in the majority of her stories."
4,An effective coverage of CVS,"Being part of the ""Essential"" series, this book doesn't pretend to be the ultimate reference on the subject, but it delivers an effective coverage of CVS. The author start from scratch and goes up to explain more advanced features like tagging and branching. In my opinion the way chapters are organized is not ideal and there is some redundancy here and there, notwithstanding these shortcomings, I would recommend it. Just be advised the whole book is totally Unix centric and all the samples cover only command-line usage."
3,Not Clear on the Merging Branches,"For me the quick way to review a CVS book is to read it's sections on merging branches. It was covered in about two pages in this book and wholely inadequate.For a general CVS admin reference, it seems OK, but I was too disappointed regarding branches. My quest for a great CVS book continues...."
2,Blarg!,"Siken's book is both over-hyped and over-dramatized. His poems are little more than language masturbations and like some regrettable one night stand leaves the reader feeling empty inside. I bought this book on recommendation from a friend who loves it --and indeed there are many who do--but his poetry strikes me as dangerously self-serving, with little to impart on the reader. I cannot for the life of me imagine Louise Gluck choosing this book - as someone who favors and employs what is ""unspoken"" in her work, Siken is an overwritten, screaming babe."
5,Amazing,"I read a quote of this book on Tumblr so I just needed to purchase it. It's a unique book and the poems within it are just beautiful. It's different but a good different and anyone who likes poetry and is considering on whether or not to purchase it, should! I thought it was too thin for the asking prize but the beauty of the poems makes the prize worth it."
5,Great local baseball video!,"The Seattle Rainiers is a great video with amazing clips from early baseball in Seattle - I loved it, my friends loved it, and my Dad loved it! I only wish that it had come with a little booklet with a timeline, names of players, etc. Definitely a ""must see"" for all you Mariners' fans!!"
3,"Good, but not her best","I picked up one of her other albums,PUBLIC RECORD, and was blown away by it. So I went out and got this one, too. Unfortunately, I was left feeling less than impressed. It's not that Rachael isn't performing good music here. It's simply that she's not performing at her best. She still has her bright, cheery voice and engaging lyrics. However, nothing here grabbed me in quite the same way. I'd recommend, for any of you who are interested in giving Rachael a try, go on over and pick up one of her other albums first, and only come to this one if you're looking to complete the set."
5,Reclaiming the Passion;Stories That Celebrate the Essence of,"This is a fabulous book! I have read it cover to cover (several times) as has my husband, parents, and daughter. They too were very impressed by the sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes funny, and true life encounters that Ms. Baird so eloquently wrote about of stories submitted by numerous nurses'. It is a MUST read by nurses and anyone else who is interested in the real 'Passion' and 'Essence of Nursing'. You will not be disappointed."
5,Don't trust cut and paste,"The product is very good and handles those ""fat files"" in your filing cabinet. I was hesitant to purchase the product because the ""Technical Details"" was the result of sloppy work by the person who writes those technical details. In the ""technical details"" section, it goes on to say that the folders were for ""legal size"" which contradicted the Amazon part description. I had to go to the Pendaflex website and look up the part number to make sure that I was ordering the non-legal-sized folder, which was what I had wanted.I am unsure if this was an Amazon editor's error or a Pendaflex editor's error. But it was misinformation at best and the worst case situation of ""cut and paste"". Amazon almost lost a sale."
2,Item says with Infopocket,I ordered this item because I definitely wanted the Infopocket. I use this to store smaller items within the customer file and not lose them at the bottom of the file folder. THREE times Amazon.com has sent the folders NOT containing the Infopocket. The Pendflex website does decribe them with the infopocket so I am assuming they are still manufactured. I am getting tired of sending back these incorrect items.
3,Needs assembly,"I wasn't as happy with this product as I have been with other pendaflex products. It requires assembly, folding a few places 'just right', punching out tabs and inserting the cardboard, and then half of them didn't hang right after the assembly. They'll still be usable, they just don't fit nicely into either my file cabinet or hanging file folder shelving. It's rather disappointing, but at least they do provide more space inside the folders. Next time I'll just go for the hanging accordion type folder though, I think they'll be far more useful."
4,"Well made, work great, still need regular hanging folders","The Pendaflex Premium 2"" flat bottom hanging folders are definitely well-made and more heavy duty than the model I usually use. The downside is that if you are not using them as flat bottom files, then they drag on the bottom of the file drawer. If you do assemble them with the provided ""bottom cards,"" then they take up 2"" of space in your file drawer. Therefore, they are not a complete replacement for regular capacity hanging folders.Bottom line: You will still need regular hanging folders. They are useful in those cases where you have a lot of folders and less useful when you have only a couple."
5,"Cutting edge Sixties radicalism, vocals & electronics for liberation","This outstanding new recording on Mode Records features one of Nono's masterworks, ""A floresta e jovem e cheja de vida"" (The Forest Is Young and Full of Life), from 1965/6. It was dedicated to the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam. Listening to this stark and horrific piece, one is reminded of how radical the 1960s were, and how in many respects everything since then has been retrenchment.Vox Nova executes the vocal component in amazing fashion, while the use of tapes is mixed by Gerard Pape. There was no exact score for this piece, which was recorded only once, and so Pape and the performers had to participate in the composition process anew, as Nono would wish. Some who have heard the original claim that this new version is far more powerful! Also included are two shorter vocal works.Mode called this recording ""Luigi Nono, Volume 1,"" but here it is 2012 and we're still waiting for Volume 2!"
3,A basic overview,"This book provides a nice overview of the New Orleans Garden District - and the drawings provide a different perspective on the architectural details. However, if the reader is looking for detailed coverage of the attractions, or stories of the District, there are better books available.Denver Mullican"
2,The PHONE,"I needed to replace an extension, on an existing phone system. I found this item online. I bought it. Paying only $11.00 less than a totally new system. I found this out after my purchase. The phone stays""charging"" all the time, even with a NEW battery. It works, It matches my current system. Due to the price I give it a ""2""."
4,This book was the bomb!,"This is the all time best book for little kids. As I was reading it about 6 years ago I wished that it will never end but it ended. If you have a child you should read this book to them, I guarantee you that your kids will like it if not too bad."
5,What a great book!,I have this book out 9 times from my library! It was definitely a must read book!! McKinely's best work!
5,An amazing rendition of the classic fairy tale,"This is the first of McKinley's coming of age books and is by no means lacking becase of that fact, it is a true classic.When I picked up this book I had just finished the dark book ""Deerskin"" and found this book surprisingly refreshing. The last time I had read the TRUE tale of Beauty and the Beast was about eight years ago in my then current orthodontist's office. Well, now eight years after that I found this book wonderfully written. Looking back I find it hard to believe that this book wasn't illustrated because it left such clear mental pictures. The character Beauty is wonderfully relateable and a strong willed young woman who is very admirable. All in all a book you do not want to miss reading. A feel good book to curl by the fireplace on a cold night with."
3,Average,"This book was suggested to me by a friend who absolutely loved it. Though I have found her book interests and mine are wildly different for the most part, this was a pleasant surprise.There wasn't anything overly spectacular about this book, but there wasn't anything too terribly wrong either. This is a good book for young teenagers, or even adults who like easy, lighthearted reads.I found the main character to be pretty likable; which is a shocker to me, because I hate most the melodramatic twits coming out of young adult books these days. It also follows the original storyline of Beauty and the Beast just enough, yet has a bit of a twist to make it its own unique story.I will say the end seemed a bit rushed and on the corny side. Overall the end was what annoyed me the most, I'm sure you'll understand if you read it yourself.Like I said, an average book. Worth reading if you're in the mood for something like it, but not necessarily for the ""serious reader""."
4,Fun for grownuips too,"You really got to know what Beauty was thinking throughout the whole story. You really get a sense of how Beauty changes from the insecure scrawny girl at home to the beautiful confident girl after she meets the beast. I liked this story most of all because it describes the romance between Beauty and the beast gradually so it seems a little more natural (or as natural as a story like Beauty and the Beast can be.) I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good retelling of any fairy tale. I must tell you that Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairy tale, and Beauty was a wonderful retelling of it. This was way different then the original tale. Most authors can't pull it off, but McKinley did a wonderful job. It was deep and rich with description and thoughts."
1,EHHHH,As for the quality of writing - I'm not a fan. Very bland - back-and-fourth type writing. Nothing spectacular.
3,Review of Beauty,"I really enjoyed this retelling of Beauty and the Beast. I, however, did not give it a 5 star rating. I did not give it a 5 because the beginning was boring and the book did not really pick up until half way. One thing I liked about the book though was that it made me want to watch the movie afterwards. One thing that did bother me about the book was when the beast kept asking Beauty every night if she would marry him. I think it would have been better if Robin McKinley made it so the asked Beauty every other night or something. I think the author shold have broken it up some with the same question. Over this entire book was good with the details especially when describing the castle and its many secrets. I would encourage any girl, lady, or woman to read this book."
5,Amazing.,"Many authors have written about this classic fairy tale, but none so well as McKinley. She takes this ancient story and creates something fresh and new from it! She makes ""Belle"" (aka: Beauty) into a deep and interesting character, as well as the rest of Beauty's (Belle's) family -- which adds the rich depth of the story.The adventure starts when Beauty's dad comes back from a business trip and he tells his incounter with the Beast, which holds terms of Beauty going to him in order to protect her family from his 'wrath'. The family refuses, especially the father, and it takes Beauty's courage and forceful nature to make it apparent to her family that she will be going to protect them from the Beast. Beauty, in the end, ends up going to the Beast and thus begins a mysterious development of a relationship between the two -- magical and fantastical. It's a beautiful, and orginial story, which everyone who loves this classic fairy tale will adore.It's a must read!"
4,It wasn't a WOW kinda book - 4 and 1/2 stars,"I thought it was alright - great writing and everything, the story was pretty good BUT The beast wasn't a very well'developed charachter, and it wasn't something new, no twists nothing.But it kept me interested I guess, so it was pretty good"
3,So so,"While I wouldn't say that I did not enjoy this book, I will say that I was disappointed. I enjoyed it up until the end where I found it to feel kind of rushed, a little cliche and a bit cheesy. I think that I just wanted a little more than a sudden epiphany from Beauty. I wanted a little more tension. Overall it was an alright book."
5,Beauty of a book,"This has been one of my favorite books for years. If you like fairy tale novelizations, this is not to be missed. It has great characterizations, an intelligent heroine (I wonder if her bookworm tendencies inspired Disney's Belle), and an overall sunny, delightful feeling pervades. You'll love it, regardless of your age. And if you like this one, please get hold of Elizabeth Pope's ""The Sherwood Ring."" It's just come back into print, and I can't resist giving it a plug here. Well worth the price."
5,My new favorite!!!,"A wonderful retelling of a classic story! Beautifully done, captures you and wont let you put it down!"
4,An excellent book,"This was a great book! I reccomend it for ages 12 and up. It was assigned to me as a book to read over the summer, since it was on the ""recommended reader's list"". So, I went to the library, to check it out, but they didn't have it, so I bought it instead. Boy was I glad I did! It was soooooo good! There were a lot big words though, that I didn't understand, but you get used to it. The beggining was also a little boring, but towards the middle I couldn't get my nose out of it! The narrator (Beauty) describes the story beautifully, and makes you feel as if you're actually there with her, looking at things the way she did. It was great! Read it!"
4,Exquisite,"This is a remarkable rendering of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" tale. It's engaging, humorous, exciting, and ultimately fulfilling. McKinley's writing refreshes the timeless story, making it seem new and vivid. Magnificent!"
4,"For Some, Not for All","I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. I thought think that it's a romantic fairy tale built on the bond of true love and the reality of the phrase ""True beauty"" It did follow some of the story plots of the original story. Yet over half the book is about Beauty and her family. Not about the beast at all. It mostly describes what happened before the beast and how she grows to love herself, beauty and all. If you enjoy the story for the feelings of Beauty toward her home and see how she changes at the end, then this book is a must. But, if you like the story for the romance then I'd just skip it."
2,Extremely overrated,"I am surprised that the book got such great reviews, because I found the writing to be very weak. The story was boring, the characters were unbelievable and unlikable, and in the end I didn't see any point. !!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!! The climax was basically Beauty getting lost in the woods on her way back to the Beast! Lame.I recommend that you read The Fire Rose by Mercedes Lackey. That retelling of Beauty and the Beast surpasses this one by far."
2,The book,"I love reeding books and I read a lot of cheesy stuff but this wasn't a good book. It was slow, didn't get to the point of the book and when it did it was boring cheesy and stupid. I felt embarrassed and couldn't get through it."
2,Disappointment!!,I was sorely disappointed with this version of Beauty and the Beast. To be frank; I hated it. I seriously don't know why this book has such a high rating when it deserves much less. Other novels by Robin McKinley are much better like The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Disney's Beauty and the Beast is so good that it's hard to surpass that version. I seriously don't recommend this novel.
5,THE best book-i recommend it to EVERYONE!!,"I read this book a little while ago, and i absolutely <3 loved it!!!! Robin Mckinley tells or should i say, retells this story sooo well. i recommended it to all of my friends and they all loved it...fullproof for almost anyone!!!"
5,a Great story,"This book is among my favorites, both in the fantasy genre and elsewhere. I often get the feeling that McKinley appeals more to female readers than to male, but I certainly appreciate her. I gave a copy of it to my first girlfriend and she loved it as well, so I have an extra reason to like this book! :)"
5,A GREAT book,"If you haven't read this book, I recomend you read it as soon as possible. It was written beautifuly."
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"This book is one of my all-time favorites. Any future authors can only hope to mimic Robin McKinley's superb character developments and vivid images of scenes. The heroine, Beauty, is a lady that women can only hope to be like. She is a fantastic role-model for girls because she is relateable to everyone. Her virtues of honesty and compassion do not make her ""above"" her peers, but rather fill-out a complex person with her own sets of problems.The Beast is multi-faceted. He changes from tyrant to prince so vividly that the reader feels like they are right in the book with the characters.This book will make an exceptional gift and is sure to be a treasured member of any well-rounded library."
4,Beauty (and Honour) by Robin McKinley,"Here is a version of the classic Beauty and the Beast with all the enchantment and no fluff, plus a little irony. Beauty is not particularily pretty at first. Rather, Beauty is a childhood nickname she gave herself in the shadow of her beautiful older sisters. Her given name is Honour which she proves when her father is captured in the magic forest. To save her father, Beauty must go live with the Beast in an enchanted castle which does everything from cleaning to dressing her to serving food. It is a perfect place, but no honest happiness exists under a spell, and all are prisoners. The characters must look deep and discover true beauty. Beauty is wonderful retelling of the classic tale with bright vocabulary and more mature ideas. It is a fun and enticing book that you want to race through even when you know what should happen but want to know how it will! Good for age 12 and up!"
1,Boring and Vapid,The title says it all. What adult would like this drivel? Don't even waste your money on this - it's not worth it.
4,4.5 stars!,"A good read! Didn't put it down until I was all the way through..really liked her take on this story, though I think now I've got to read the original..."
3,Okay,"The book was okay. Not great, not terrible - but okay. As someone who re-reads the books I enjoy many times, I will not read this one again.The Kindle edition had several OCR errors."
3,Did not live up to its promise,"The book had a great storyline, but was too disjointed and jumped around far too much.For me that took a lot away from my enjoyment of the book. Maybe I'm just too picky, but this is my take on it."
3,Story with very much sense...but it wasnt presented nicely,"The book's meaning was very heart warming and all, but the story line??? Not so good. Yeah it's easy to read and comprehensive but it's the story line....it can be compared to a good joke delivered by a boring and unenthusiastic person."
3,Sugar Gliders- Care & Breeding Video Review,"This video gave some good information on many different aspects of sugar glider care such as where to find a sugar glider, feeding, handling, breeding, and veterinary care. Although the quality of the video was lacking it presented some good insight on suggies. It's worth purchasing if you're thinking about adopting a sugar glider."
2,Low quality,"I bought this as a replacement for another similar dart board (Excaliber) as I had lost some darts. However, this one is manufactured with very low quality - magnets are weaker and often slide down 6+ inches after hitting the board, darts are smaller and not ergonomically shaped, the hanging rod had a one side cap falled off in shipping. Dont waste your precious playing time on such poor quality product."
1,a Little bit small,Delivering was ok but my only issue with it is that its little but small... I saw one at a friend house it was bigger then what I received so I had to give it to my nephew...
3,Ok,Didn't read how big it was so that's my fault so it's a little small other than that's it's cool and my daughter loves it
3,smaller than i expected,Not bad kind of cheap...Works ok...On the small side I expected it to be bigger than it was but it works
5,Great product! Great price,Second time I've gotten this item and been very pleased. Never had a problem with them and will definitely buy again!
1,Waste of my time,"This machine is absolutely horrible. First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box and set it up is the cheap feel and quality of the materials especially the handset which also did not work properly. I got a lot of static from the handset making it impossible to talk on the phone. Since you need the handset to record the outgoing message for the answer machine I was not able to get a clear message recorded. But that was not the only problem out of the box, I was never able to get a single fax printed because I kept getting paper jams. The print ribbon would get rolled up with the paper and jam the machine. It was a total waste of time. Definitely not worth $180. I had the machine delivered at my office and when the secretary saw it she said ""Oh no, you got a Brother, they're nothing but trouble."" I only wish I would have talked to her before I ordered it."
5,Grace Evora Oh Yeah..? Oyeeeee!!,"I found Grace Evora's music when I was searching for anotherCape Verdean artist with the same last name..and it was love atthe first note..! This musician can entertain people of anynationality, from Africa, Europe, USA or South America..or justabout anywhere..Mars included that is..!! A music lover's mustin their collection..!!"
4,Grace Evora does it again.,"Grace Evora's ""ROMANCE"" is a wonderful and meaningful cd. I really enjoy listening to Grace, he has a wonderful voice and really knows how to play the drums. I think that he is the best cape verdean artist and really knows what the ""CABO FANS"" like to hear. This cd is a must for any collection. Keep up the good work!"
3,Pretty good coverage though outdated and ruminative,"This book is generally easy to read with few cases that are very difficult to understand. Unfortunately, given the changes in banking law and the foreshadowed changes, the book is outdated at two years old. My only other complaint is that it uses multiple cases to show some very simple legal decisions that would have been easily and more efficiently described in a quick note paragraph. The use of charts is a plus as most legal casebooks do not know how to incorporate technical writing into their legal mess."
4,More Freestyle,"Lots of great songs. There were a few times where the ""Mixtress"" should have done less mixing and more playing of the whole, original songs. Still, I'm very happy with my purchase. GREAT price (3 discs) and fast delivery."
5,Art Escapes has lots of ideas!,"The subtitle of this how-to book says it all! Art Escapes is chock-full of creative ideas, hints for success, and practical step-by-step exercises for beginners and experienced artists. And the examples, both initial sketches and finished work, are inspiring and informative.The author is so down-to-earth, encouraging and freeing that I found myself writing and drawing in the margins! This really made it my reference book for daily practice.I also like the advice and ideas about how to jump-start my creativity each day."
2,Too light in content,"This isn't so much a book to me as it is a portfolio presentation with it's spiral binding and minimal pages. It doesn't work for me because, as one reviewer said, there are other books that better facilitate the creative process. For the price you can get much more quality and quantity than this one offers. My suggestion is ""The Artist's Way"" by Cameron, a book that has content that will keep unpealing levels in thought process towards substance. I'd categorize this as a book more apt for pre-teens and teens who enjoy a mix of crafting projects."
1,Pious Fraud,"The Archko Volume is a pious fraud by a Rev. Mahan of Missouri. It purports to be a translation of ancient writings about the historical Jesus, but none of it is authentic. The Vatican source he lists never existed, the translators he lists are fictitious.There are folks who get hold of this and think it provides evidence about Jesus, but it was denounced as a fraud when it came out and the author was kicked out of his church for writing it.A detailed debunking is found in Goodspeed's book ""Modern Apocrypha."" It's out of print, but can be found. The shame is that the Archko Volume is not out of print too."
5,Purple Sock Pink Sock,This is a great book for toddlers with emerging sitting still skills. The words are simple and go quickly on each for little fingers to turn quickly. It also teaches some basic color skills. Both of my kids have enjoyed this book to no end.
5,A lucid look at a culture in crisis,"It's easy to pen a diatribe against the Bush regime, but John Powers does something different. His witty, opinionated (yet even-handed) and amazingly wide ranging critique of political and popular culture during this dark patch of American history is a remarkable acheivement. It's a heartening book that contextualizes not only the president and his cronies, but reality TV, Michael Moore, dour leftists, and various other seemingly unhinged aspects of American media. Powers pulls his material together seamlessly, creating an important book of our moment."
2,Really good editing software with really bad accuracy,"I recently bought this editor and found it to be a major help. I could easily swap clips wherever need and I could add titles and audio clips from cd's, but the only MAJOR PROBLEM, which is really annoying and as a result I am in the process of returning this product, is that there is no accuracy whatsoever when it begins recording to a tape. The scene always starts about five seconds too late and stops after its already gone into the next shot. I am not an expert, but I know quite a bit about editing and tried many different options in correcting this problem until I said ""enough is enough""."
5,Five stars all around,"This has got to be the best all-around book on telescopes and astronomy ever written. It covers everything from the very basics to fairly advanced optics, mirror grinding and telescope construction. I bought my first copy back in 1969 when I was a junior in high school. I have worn out two copies and was ecstatic when I found it was back in print. Bought my third copy immediately. I still use it on a regular basis and would recommend it to anyone at any level of expertise."
5,Great book!,I whish I had this book when I first got my telescope.Still available new from Edmund Scientifics for $12.95.
5,A truly great guide for the beginner and pro alike,"This was my first book about building telescopes. My dad gave it to me in the early 1970's with my first telescope kit. Published and sold by Edmunds Scientific in Barrington, NJ. This superbly illustrated book describes in detail the steps necessary to make your own telescope or how to use the completed telescope that you bought.This work features telescopes and kits sold by Edmunds Scientifics, however the principles ennunciated apply to almost all telescopes.All about telescopes has a decidedly 1960's flavor, however the material is truly timeless. It is a worthy addition to any telescope maker or amateur astronomer's library. I highly recommend it.Francis J. O'Reilly"
1,Does Nothing,Product doesn't do a thing for me. Overhyped like many other products on market. Perhaps it just doesn't work for me. I don't know.
1,Read Your Bible Again First,"Rather than waste too much time trying to understand dispensationalists without first grasping what is promised for us, please take the time to read and study through the book of Revelation (that's the last book of the New Testament for those who might not know) before you invest in this book. From my perspective, I found this book to be a slanted, liberal useless waste of time written by someone who must be questioning their faith and/or does not believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God."
1,DON'T BUY,This is one of the wost scanner i have ever had. Picturequality is very low. From a scale from one to ten i rate this a-1. This is so horible of a scanner it is off the charts.
3,If you can get it to work...,"The picture quality is very nice... WHEN you can get it to work. It's not supported under WinXP, so to get it to work takes a lot of work... Good luck ;)"
3,Ok for the price......,"I got this awhile ago and it just doesn't work now. It scans, but there is a blackbar on the side. So, I am looking for a new one. It's ok for the price that it's at."
3,"Crazy,out of control rockstar!","A group of boys at Sweet Valley school decide to start up a rockband and they need a girl who can sing.Jessica can sing!Usually,that is but right now Jessica's role-model is a deep gravelly singer called Melody Power and when Jess scores role as leadsinger,she sounds like a lawnmower with a terrible cold.(or something like that).Somehow Elizabeth must stop her from singing without saying,""Jessica you sound like a pig in labour""or something like that.Because if Jessica sings,peopl will boo or laugh and she will be humiliated!!"
2,"Feels cheap, didn't work, missing hardware","Consumer Reports rated Air King fans pretty high, but I didn't feel this way after installing it. It felt cheaply made, and the steel used wasn't welded together quite right. I think this resulted in reduced air flow, because it really didn't seem to pull much air out of the bathroom, and if my shower went longer than 5 minutes it started dripping water out of the grill onto my bathroom floor. And I don't believe the sones advertised were accurate as it was louder than expected. Maybe this particular fan wasn't caught during quality control, but I didn't want to take another chance.I returned it for a Panasonic fan which I can't rave enough about. The Panasonic just felt solid, didn't drop water, kept the mirror clear and was incredibly quiet. And it included the hardware I needed to complete the job. Buy a Panasonic."
5,Dry bathroom!,"This fan is perfect. We have a 10 x12 bathroom that was constantly steamed up. After installing this fan, we finally have a dry bathroom and its extremely quiet."
1,disappointed,After a few months it got very noisy from vibration. The bracket on the plastic cover broke. I was very disappointed with this fan.
4,Wrongly advertised,"First off, I can not leave any comments about the actual product due to the wrong information that is given in the product description on the Amazon website. I have a HP Photosmart D7160 and after reading the product description on the amazon website I assumed this model would be compatible. After ordering it, the product is NOT compatible with my printer. Now I have a new paper weight!!!"
1,CHECK YOUR POOH BEAR!,"My daughter just received this as a gift for her first birthday - it was so cute we took it out right away. First thing I did was squeeze his TUMMY, which is the most noticible part of Pooh, and he replied by saying it was his HAND!!!!! Both EARS worked OK, but when I got to his left foot, it changes between saying it's his TUMMY or his HAND!!!!! This is not a good teaching toy when malfunctioning! I am calling Fisher-Price in the morning for a replacement."
2,The education of Harriet Hatfield,"I found this book very dated. The writing is stiff and the flow is very stilted. It is also a little incredulous. Imagine, if you can, a woman who is a lesbian but doesb;t really know she is, although she is in a sexual relationship with a woman for many, many years. Then this partner dies and she opens a bookstore for women and within days has met an abused wife, two nuns, several lesbian couples, a homosexual couple (one of whom is not monogamous and has contracted AIDS from a casual sexual partner, etc... Oh, she also has a gay brother, a homophobic brother, and an attorney who thinks she is just plain nuts. Come on....It's just all over the top."
3,Disappointing,"I can't say this book isn't well-written, it is. But it seems rather self-consciously ""uplifting"". The characters in it are all a bit too noble; dialogue is awkwardly formal, even for well-to-do, highly educated people. Friendships with oh-so-wonderful people are formed so easily and quickly. Many, many people like these do exist -- I know many of them; but the writer seemed to make the situation rather than let it happen -- a bit of a fairy tale, in spite of the realities of hatred that it discusses. I couldn't place the period when this takes place; Mary Daly's book, central to the story, was published in 1998, but the copyright on this novel is 1989."
4,Very nice,"I like the phone. The speaker is very clear and volume increases sufficiently for ""soft talkers"" to be heard."
4,good performer,"This phone uses batteries for its 20 station memory,and speakerphone power. This is a good feature because you can keep your favorites by changing batteries before they go dead(it gives you a minute to do so before losing memory)this should prevent you having to reprogram when power losses happen. All the other features work fine,and this phone sounds great.A couple of extra memory cards would have earned a 5 star rating from me."
3,It hisses,"I bought this Panasonic phone after having excellent results with cordless Panasonic phones (KX-TGA520M). I needed a phone that would not require electricity for power outages and when my battery went dead from over use. The phone had the features I wanted (head phone jack, speaker, mute and no answering machine).Unfortunately there is a persistant hiss on this phone. I tried it with a DSL filter and without and it makes no difference. The cordless is still crystal clear, so I use that phone 99% of the time.Luckily we had the corded phone. Hurricane Ike took out our power for 4 days and this was the only phone working after the cell phones went dead."
3,"Nice phone, but the speaker broke.","This is a nice inexpensive phone, but the speaker quit working 11 months after I purchased it. I'm going to send it back and hopefully, get a replacement. Wish they made a higher quality product for home use. I'd gladly pay a little more for a better product."
2,Disappointing speakerphone,"I bought this phone for use in my home office based on the rave reviews on this site for its speakerphone. Unfortunately, I have had nothing but repeated complaints that the voice is distorted or goes in and out, with the beginnings and ends of sentences frequently cut off. I am in the market for another phone after just 2 months."
1,Does not meet expectations,"The phone has no caller ID. This was a feature that I overlooked and was disappointed but it was my problem. My focus when I ordered was overlooked caller ID in favor of the good reviews for speakerphone quality. It is just not good enough. The phone hangs on a kitchen family dining wall so that we would talk hands free in that area of the house. However, unless we stand within a 3 or 4 feet of the phone then the person on the other end of the call cannot hear/understand. Would return if not for the restocking fee."
1,Item was the wrong color,"Item was advertised as white, but it was really grey. As a result we had to return item and assume the cost of mailing it back."
1,Not for walls,"I bought this phone to replace another Panasonic that I had for many years, used as a wall-mounted phone. This phone's wall connection is bad in two respects. Most wall/desk phones have an attachment for DESK. This one has the attachment for WALL use, and it holds the phone much too far from the wall. Once it is on the wall, the angle is wrong so that the receiver does not stay on the phone."
4,Some People Like Cords,"I wanted a simple, corded phone, but most phones in the stores are cordless... and the ones that had cords were really expensive business models. This Panasonic model fit my needs.I use it with my cable company's telephone service, and it sounds great. There's a handy volume control, so I can crank it up if I can't hear the other party. A lot of times when I call companies, I'll get an automated answering service, but each company sets their automated system to a different volume. This phone's volume control helps solve that problem.There is a handy headphone jack, but it requires a smaller headphone input than your regular headphones. (I think it's 2.5 mm instead of 3.5 mm.) Plus you only hear sound in 1 ear... but you're already doing that with the earpiece anyway.There's no caller ID, but most callers (especially telemarketeres) show up as unlisted anyway."
3,Panasonic desktop phone,"This phone was exactly what I was looking for. I needed it for my job at home. The one I have still works but you cannot find a headset to fit it. Well, this phone works well and I love that I can also plug my fax machine into it. However, finding a headset was not easy and turned out to be very expensive and with the headset attached the volume is minimized - I don't like this at all. If you don't need the headset part, its a great phone but if you work at home like me and need that - try another phone, don't waste your money."
4,It is time to speak up!,"A simple phone for simple tasks and it does everything that it is supposed to do, and does it all extremely well with one minor exception which caused me to give it four stars instead of five. The speaker is very clear, but I do wish I could get a bit more volume out of it. In all fairness, I am a bit more than slightly hard of hearing so probably I am just being too demanding. I am very happy with it---no regrets. I would recommend this to everyone, even the near deaf if they will only wear their hearing aids when they want to use the speaker. (I hate to wear them.)"
5,What an outstanding phone !,I bought this phone for my 92 year old Father who uses the speaker phone feature to answer his phone calls. The sound quality is excellent!I bought a second phone for my own house.Great quality at a resonable price!
1,MUTE button is AWFUL and downright embarrassing,"As has been mentioned in other reviews, the mute button makes a very loud click on the other end. I've been told this and tested it by leaving myself a voice mail. It's just horrible, and completely unprofessional for the other party. If you NEVER plan to use Mute, then it's an otherwise good phone. But a Mute button bug like this is a thoughtless design flaw."
3,PANASONIC PHONE,phone sits VERY far off the wall.speaker phone does not work like the average phone. You have to pick up the receiver and than hit speaker phone and hang up the receiver in order for your speaker phone to work.
5,An intertaining and informative look at the Bible.,"This is a great Bible Study and devotional companion. It covers the entire Bible and its key players with amazing detail for such a breif easy read. The ""handwritten"" text, prolific cartoons, and interesting sketches bring order and clarity to the history of the Bible. Perhaps even more importantly, Jenkins outlines the Gospel message clearly while covering each New Testament book and author as well as other key players and journeys. I highly recommend it for those new to the Bible or those who simply want to refresh their ""big picture"" knowledge of the world's greatest book. Enjoy."
2,Why Is It Named After Gary?,"A good cast wasted. Poorly written, filled with every cliche of ""life on the edge"", the film never gives depth to the three characters whose lives are so deeply intertwined. Their feelings for each other are never illuminated, so we don't know why they are together. They yell and fight and act outageously, but they give us no reason to care about them. For this I blame not the actors, but the director who seems to have no idea how real life happens or how real people talk to each other.Salma Hayek comes off the best, though her charcter is unrelentingly irritating. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as always, a very intelligent actor. Thomas Jane is pouty and intense, but has the least well-written character to work with.And why is the movie named after him, when the center of this drama is not Gary (Thomas Jane) but Valentino (Vincent D'Onofrio)?"
1,"One of the worst movies ever made...yes, I'm serious","Where to begin? Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING. Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard ""colorful"" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get? An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure. Nice cover art, though."
1,One Of The Worst Films Ever,"This has got to be one of the most boring, pointless films I have ever seen. It is impossible to build up any empathy for the characters and the plot is non-existant. All the Characters are one dimensional and listening to Salma Hayak scream for virtually the whole movie is very tiring. Watching a trio of losers live in a hovel, sit in a hospital and have sex in bathrooms does not a movie make."
5,I loved it,"There are scenes in this movie that I did not enjoy, but for the most part its a quirky little movie with a big heart and actors who do some great work, especially Thomas Jane. Any movie that has a drag queen lip-synching Patsy Cline in the first scene can't be that bad!"
3,"Confusing, didnt develop well.","The Velocity of Gary didn't develop well at all. I was confused for the first half of the movie as things were being thrown together. I didn't connect with the movie. It isn't until Vincent D'Onofrio begins to die of AIDS does the characters really come out. The acting in the beginning wasn't too good, it's as though they shot the first part when the actors were young, then let them go off and become really good, and then shoot the second half. Mary Carmen comes across as not believeable sometimes but she does put on a good performance. Vincent D'Onofrio seems a bit fake, almost flaky and its as though Thomas Jane isn't even in the movie. It's okay to watch when your with a bunch of friends and you have someone to chat about it with (yeah yeah talking during the movie) but alone you might get lost."
1,As bad as it gets.,"This movie missed the theaters and went straight to video, and even this fate is too good for it. The acting is terrible, the characterizations are not credible, and the plot developments--the few that there are--- are dull. Selma Hayek plays an absurdly stereotypical ""NYC foul-mouthed Latin Chick,"" the sort of role that used to be pushed on Rosie Perez.This picture pretends to treat homo and hetero relationships evenhandedly, but the homo component is really a bit of ""spice"" put in to underscore how far out of the mainstream these characters are. The hetero relationship is the only one that is explored in any depth, and that depth is minimal."
5,Nice Adapter,Good quality adaper. Looks like it should hold up for a long time and was well worth the money spent.
4,"Xlr to 1/4"" adaptor good price","Seems to work fine for what I needed, though time will tell how good the overall reliability and quality is."
2,no good for long term use,"parts came a little loose, I guess that is what to be expected for the price. If you are looking to buy something that will last and be used quite a bit don't buy this but, if you want something that will barely be used and not long term then look no further."
2,Poorly made,"When I received this item, it was so loose, I thought it was going to fall apart. I actually had to use a screwdriver to tighten the screw that holds it together before use. I would NOT recommend buying this item. Go for a more expensive one. You will thank yourself! Lesson learned..."
2,wobbly part,"What can I say? It is probably one of those things- ""You get what you pay for"". It won't be worth it to send it back. I will go down to Radio Shack and get one that doesn't have the separate pieces loose from each other. (The adapter twists inside the housing)"
2,"Buy a few, throw the bad ones out.","The reviews for this item seem to be generally pretty good. How could they not be? It's such a basic device, no moving parts. It's an adapter. There's not much to get wrong. BUT, with mine, the 1/4"" jack is either mildly warped or a little thick, out of round, or something because it does not plug in easily to any of my amps and because you basically have to force the snug connection, the end is beginning to come loose. I wouldn't bother returning it since it's only fifty-five cents, but maybe I'm just reporting that, in hindsight, I should have bought four or five of them, thrown the ill-fitting ones away and still ended up ahead."
3,Did not quite fit.,This is just an adaptor but when I tried to plug it in it would not fit into the 1/4 inch jack. There was a burr all around the shaft located at the insulator part between the shaft and the tip. I had to chuck the adaptor in a drill and touch it up with a file to remove the burr so it would fit. It was not worth returning when I could fix it up in about 5 minutes. Cheap adapter but it works.
4,Handy,"Useful for connecting mics to a guitar amp or directly into a computer's mic jack. The 1/4"" side tends to become a bit loose after a while, not sure if it affects performance though."
3,XLR Female to 1/4' Male,Product shipped and arrived in a fast timeline! Packaged very well. Use to have this product years ago except it appeared to be more durable than this one. Always good to carry with you to any gig just in case
3,Does what it suppose too,Wish I would read up on this product before I bought it. Good for leaving it place because I don't want to break it from taking off and on the xlr cable.
5,A Must Have In The Audio Kit,"The Shure XLR Female to Male 1/4"" Adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit.I've got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to.Now this one as pictured is the mono version, which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced 1/4"" jack. If you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable, this adapter will not work for you. You'll need the TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) balanced version of this adapter."
3,Good but not for every application,"These are good little adapters, but are not usable for Hi-z to Low-z applications(guitar to mixer line in). They are solid, and well made, but do not have the transformer in them to eliminate high output buzz."
1,Poorly Made,This item broke in the first week of use-not acceptable.We would not recommend this to anyone if they want a quality product that lasts.
1,"XLR Female to 1/4"" Male Adapter","This piece of trash simply fell apart right out of the package with no pressure applied, and could not be repaired."
2,Maintenance Nightmare,"We purchased two of these machines and after about 6 months began having trouble with both. One of them always pulled multiple sheets of paper and jammed when receiving faxes or printing copies. After replacing just about every roller in there, it worked for a few months, and now it's back to jamming again.The other fax was more reliable until just a month ago, when recipients began complaining of a black stripe down the side of their fax. We followed Brother's recommendations and cleaned various parts inside, but the only thing that fixed it was unplugging and pluggings back in the power. Even then, it was only a temporary fix. A local repair shop estimates around $150 to repair what the think is a bad scanner.Maybe I just got a bad batch of these, but I would suggest caution before buying one."
2,one love rewiew,"this album has been overly anticipated.but i think it's not what a lot of new edition fans want to hear. it's too much bbd stuff.there are only two songs worth being singles on this album and they are rewrite the memories, and hot2nit. the other songs are mediocre. they'll get decent record sales soley for there name and loyal fans. bobby brown is truely missed on this album.regardless of what the media says he is the only star in this group besides gill. Tresvant sounds the same with his limited vocal ability. the only other thing i have to say is why didn't gill sing more leads, and how the hell do they do this album without there most popular member brown. some 20th anniversary. sorry to say but this will be a quickly forgotten reunion album."
4,Yay!!! NEW EDITION ARE BACK!,"As an old school r&b; and New Edition fan, I have to say, this album is very good. Some of the songs are very catchy and are real nice to dance to. A good album to blast your stereos with. Their music has changed greatly over the years from classics such as ""Can you stand the rain"" to sexy upbeat songs like ""Hot 2 night"" and ""All on you.""A good buy for all R&B; lovers."
4,The re-invention,The album is straight BBD with a dose of Ralph T. on the hook (ala Nate Dogg) but it's all Bad Boy at it's finest.Sexy Lady has a hook you just can't forget and Love Again is just infectious.Big up to N.E. from '83 on up.
4,New Edition is back!,"This is classic New Edition with an updated spin to it. If you expect to hear the same old Bubble Gum music of the '80s...look elsewhere. As New Edition grew up, so did their music. Excellent album!"
5,NE is back with another fantastic CD,"When i first heard that NE was signing with Bad Boy. I wasnt really quite sure what to expect or what would come out of this venture. But its safe to say after listening to ""One Love"" for the 2nd time in as many days. It very obvious that it is more than alright or good. It is fantastic. I've been an NE since ""Cool It Now"", ""Count Me Out"", ""Is This The End"" and so many other classics. They still bring it with a venegance. NE has been in the business for 20 years and they are still. If not more talented than quite a few acts out there right now.The only other thing i can say. Is that by giving this CD a chance from beginning to end. You will see how New Edition got it started and is still doing it with mad talent to spare.One love indeed. I gonna play this CD for a long time to come.Enjoy!!!"
5,"New Edition Behind The Music On VH1 April 18, 2005","This album is definitely underrated. I can not believe that NE did not go triple platinum with this one. This album is a blend of NE, BBD, JG and RT, w/o losing that true NEW EDITION sound. Maturity and growth can defnitiely be seen on this album. This is a must have! If you're a true NE fan or a lover of GREAT music, you need to go pick up like 5 copies of this CD so you can have one in the house, one in the car, one at work and two on standby should something happen to any of the others. The CD is smooth, sexy and hip w/o being overt. My boys are at it again and I will make sure I'm in the house at their concert nextmonth.PS Don't forget to watch their Behind The Music Special on VH1 04/28/05. It's a must see!"
5,Jennie Review--One Love Should be a Double CD,Ever since Candy Girl i have been a major fan so when i brought this album i though it was greatIm happy they are at Bad Boy so Puffy keep up the Good work and don't make our boys look bad
5,Get the album or Die,"New Edition has truly shown the fans that they have nothing but One Love for all of us. With this much anticipated album, they have generated talk even among people such as myself of the young age of 20. Tracks on the album that are just off the hook are of course ""Hot 2 nite"" which sets the atmosphere for a club dance. The Conference Call which sets the atmosphere for the record and grabs your attention, lets you know right away that the album is off the hook. New Edition was formed in the year of my birth, so this is like a part of my history, and I am glad to be in it. If you haven't copped this album yet, WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU WAITING ON!!!!! Go out and get this ablum ""One Love"" and get Hot 2 Nite with New Edition!!!!!!!"
4,One New Edition - One Love,"I absolutley love this CD. Here where I live I had to travel to several of the local department stores to find the CD on release day. New Edition did it again, I love the combination of Bad Boy with NE, it's a good mix, however, the NE sound and orginially is there. I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially you die hard NE fans. Congraulation fellows, you made History!"
4,Very good album!!!!,"I liked New Edition's One Love. They are still able to keep up with today's sounds and trends, especially the Puffy-inspired uptempo songs on the first half. Hot2Nite is quite good and songs like Start Turning Me On have very rugged grooves in them! The ballads are fabulous, very slow and calmly paced. Re-write The Memories and Newness, two Jam and Lewis songs, are reminiscent of Can You Stand The Rain, but continue on the romantic love themes. Ralph Tresvant still sounds good on his leads, and Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins familiar raps still crackle with energy. Johnny Gill is again stealing the show from Ralph on most of the ballads with his leads. He still is at the top of his game with the group the same way he has as a solo artist. Some longtime groups return after a 5, 6 or 8-year hiatus with a subpar, flat album with no feel to it. New Edition avoids that hurtle and makes another good album that shows that they are still enduring and consistent!"
1,Bad Boy and NE not a good mix,"New Edition needs a production team that is more in tune with their smooth light hearted style. The beats, for the most part, are too powerful and punchy for their vocals. This CD is like Babyface or Maxwell singing to tracks that Biggie would rap to - not a good combination. Gill comes out of nowhere on track 12 with a deeply masculine sound that in no way compliments the group. Why isn't he solo? Why isn't Bell? I guess it's all for one and one for all. At least w/ all the hype of being linked to Diddy and their loyal following they'll make decent sales. Aren't these guys grown men? Their lyrics don't reflect it."
2,Average,these cats should consider getting on the Las Vegas Gravy Train now while they are still very young. this Album sounds like a Karoke of Cuts over the past 15-18 years. nothing here really stands out.New Edition ain't made an Album that has truly Counted since 88.Rlaph was peaking then Vocally but that has been a while now.they need better material&Bobby Brown Back. I see why Puffy wasn't in a hurry to drop this one so soon.
2,first New Edition disappoitment,"I remember how excited I was to hear that New Edition was releasing another album. I've been an NE fan since Candy Girl and couldn't wait to buy the CD (and I don't buy that many CDs). I was a little nervous about them being on Bad Boy though.And that was for good reason. This release was the first and only time I was sorely disappointed in a New Edition album. The CD as a whole is ultimately forgettable. There was way too much effort to conform to Bad Boy's ultra-young over-the-top sex and hip hop instead of being true to what New Edition's legacy and appeal have always been. Mike and Ron's tired hip hop wannabe rap act wears thin within their first two bars of rhymes. These guys aren't 17 years old, but Bad Boy puts all their eggs in that basket.I await NE's next release and pray that they will actually sing about something the next time around."
3,No love given for One Love,"This album was okay, the best song being ""Come Home With Me"". But if you saw their ""Behind the Music"", you know that even they didn't like this album much. Diddy had them singing all of these ""younger generation"" songs when they were grown men. And this album wasn't promoted enough; looks like Diddy was saving all of his muscle for pushing that new Biggie album."
5,NE the bomb,This album is hot. If you have ever been a fan of NE get this album and they won't let you down.
2,Avg at Best,"This CD starts out with Diddy saying 'Let's make History'. The only history made on this CD is the fact that is probably the worst NE CD to come out. I have every NE CD from Candy Girl on up to One Love and there is nothing on this CD that you will remember 6 months to a year from now. The best track is 'Hot 2 Night', but the song only has 1 verse. So while it's very catchy the first few times you listen to it, after the 5th time it is quite repedative and will have a very short life on the charts. The track 'All on you' is pretty good, but should have been a BBD song and not a NE song. My next favorite track is 'Newness', which is a nice slow jam. However, this song sounds very similiar to a track from their 'Home Again' CD. All other tracks are very average with no highlights.This CD is a disappointed, after the long wait for this CD to finally get released. I guess I'll put my NE: Heartbreak CD in now and remember the days when they had great producers working on their stuff."
2,PLEASE DON'T DIDDY AGAIN!!!,"I AM A TRUE NEW EDITION FAN FROM POPCORN LOVE, BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER IF THEY HAD A TRUE MUSICAL GENIUS LIKE R. KELLY OR JIMMY JAM AND TERRY LEWIS PUT THEM AN ALBUM TOGETHER. BELL BIV DEVOE WOULD OF DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB THEMSELVES. THIS MOVE MUST OF HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH FINANCES. SAVE DIDDY FOR A REMIX AND DON'T DIDDY AGAIN!?!."
4,Home Again # 2,"The CD is a great one to listen to. Put in the disk and just press play. It is great to see NE stay with the style they are known for. It is a shame with all the corporate consolidation where all radio stations are either owned by Radio One or Clear Channel the programming director will not give any of the other tracks much if any airplay.It would have been nice if Bobby had joined his boyz on this (Another ""You Don't Have to Worry"" type jam would have set it off) project. Oh well one person doesn't stop the show.The only thing other than having Bobby back would have been to have Johnny Gill featured more on the lead of more songs.To wrap this up, This is a definite must have. Quality tracks. You really get your money's worth."
3,"It has ""BEEN SO LONG""!!!!","I have been waiting for this cd to be released since the summer. I really like this cd it is definately not there best but there definately are some good tracks such as ""Been so Long"", ""Hot 2 NIte, ""Last Time"", ""Newness"" and my favorite ballad"" Rewrite the Memories"" has very pretty lyrics. This cd I rated a 3 stars because it seems like it was a work in progress due to the fact that they worked with a lot of young producers when they should have stuck with more polished producers who can bring the best out of them but overall this is a good disc."
2,I'M AN NE FAN....BUT THE TRUTH IS...................,"I EXPECTED A BETTER EFFORT -WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ""HOT2NITE"" THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF OF THE CD IS MONEY WASTED ON OUTDATED BBDISH TRACKS WHICH ARE HORRIBLE-THE TITLE TRACK ""ONE LOVE' IS A GREAT SONG, HOWEVER IT'S AN INTERLUDE & ONLY 2 MINUTES LONG (WHAT A SHAME!)-THE CD GETS BETTER AT TRACK 11-""THAT'S WHY I LIED"" THIS MELODIC TRACK IS NICE TO LISTEN TO. ""BEST MAN"" IS O.K.-THE STANDOUT TRACKS ARE THE JIMMYJAM, TERRY LEWIS LACED TRACKS ""COME HOME WITH ME' FEATURING SHARP LEAD VOCALS FROM JOHNNY GILL, THE SENSATIONAL BALLAD & HOPEFUL SINGLE ""RE-WRITE THE MEMORIES"" AND THE MID-TEMPO GROOVE ""NEWNESS"" ANOTHER POTENTIAL HIT IS THE MICHAEL WINANS PRODUCED ""LEAVE ME"". THE REALITY OF THE MATTER, IS NE SHOULD HAVE USED JIMMYJAM AND TERRY LEWIS TO WRITE AND PRODUCE THE ENTIRE CD...IT TRULY WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMEBACK. (P.S. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, ADDING BOBBY BROWN WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS CD ANY BETTER)."
1,What?,Would this guy please stop ripping off Bone Thugs-N-Harmony with all his thug stuff! Bone Thugs are the BEST and the ONLY!
5,No Doubt!,"Trick represents like a MUG! Every track on this album brings heat. I didn't think it got any better than ""www.thugs"",but it does. Ch.AK vs 47 is the bomb. Trick really went all out on this album. ""Boy"" has the tightest bass and lyrics. My fav tracks are: (2)Boy,(3)Sittin on D,(4)Gettin on up,(5)America,(7)Thug for Life,(9)walkin like a hoe,(10)stop smokin-its got an ugly beat but mystikal is tight as sh** on this track,(12)Could it be-is the slow track on the cd, and if you dont know twista you will now, and he will be one of your fav new artists. Those are my fav tracks. If you dont have this album go get it you'll have it forever its just that good."
5,Trick Daddy is on top,"Trick Daddy is king of the rap game with his new release. If u though Thug.com was good then Book Of Thugs, Chapter Ak Verse 47 will blow it away. If u want the best in the game today. Pick up the newest track from Trick Daddy."
4,The Bomb,This is trick daddy's best cd yet. My favorite song is shut up because my high school band was in the video. Great work and congratulaions to the other band that joined us Miami Jackson Generals!
3,Good Follow Up to WWW.THUG.COM,"While, some of the track you may skip through this was a decent follow up to Tricks www.Thug.com ""Sitting on D's is a strong dope boy track, while ""Shut UP"" amply got the club crunk. Now when this album was brought out it was really Trick and Lil John whom were putting out club music.....safely creating diversity in there music. The beats are heavier on this album, an the Hooks crisper. Decent album for a follow up for Trick.Add to your collection"
3,Not their best work...but,"Stereolab is special, and their sound can command attention or can be excellent background music. Cobra is even more subtle and more simplistic than Dots and Loops, but it lacks the sheer kitchy catchiness of Emperor. Still, this is a fine mood music album that does succeed in ambience where it may fail in freshness."
4,"Stereolab's Best Since ""Tomato Ketchup""","The first time I listened to this disc I didn't think much of it, but after another two or three plays I was very impressed. In my opinion, ""Cobra and Phases Group..."" is best listened to in sections rather than straight through, my personal favorites being the ""Radax Permutation"" / ""Velvet Water"" / ""Blue Milk"" section (Tracks 8-10) and ""Strobo Acceleration"" / ""Emergency Kisses"" / ""Come and Play..."" (Tracks 13-15). Tracks 4 and 11 are patience-trying minimalist noise epics in the spirit of the Velvet Underground's ""Sister Ray"": you'll want to use the skip function on those, but otherwise, this is one of Stereolab's best."
3,Averge Stereolab,"The music of Stereolab brings to mind images of upper class people in thick black framed glasses sitting (in perfect poise) around a table in a trendy coffee shop sipping their coffee(with pinky finger up) and discussing the latest hip things. Nevertheless, I still like Stereolab. This cd isn't the best I've heard from them. In fact, track #9, ""Puncture In The Radar Permutation"", is the only track I really like a lot. The rest of it doesn't quite have the spice of earlier works, or maybe I've just grown tired of the same old stuff from them."
5,Give it time,"A multi-layered cacophony of beauty.Stereolab never fail to surprise and blow me away! This may take some of you a while to get into, but give it time. From start to finish, this is a 15 track album of multi-mood sensation.Every track is beautifully and lovingly crafted.Perhaps the only criticism I have is that ""Blue Milk"" is far to short! What an album,what a band. Stereolab!"
5,I'm still stunned . . . in a good way!,"This album is absolutely incredible. I bought a promo copy of this album about a month before it came out for the sum of forty dollars and it was worth every penny. The only way this album can disappoint is if one sees them perform live. Their live versions of ""Infinity Girl"" and ""Blips, Drips, n Strips"" still make me smile when I think about them."
4,Electronica + Vocals = Great Disc,"This is the first Stereolab disc that I have owned, so I cannot approach this review as a seasoned veteran of their fairly extensive catalog of highly inventive electronica.However, I can unequivocally say that I really enjoyed this disc, and it has motivated me to become better acquainted with Sterolab's sound. On this title, the perky (and sometimes discordant) eletro/techno sounds contrasts with, while at the same time emphasizing, highly melodic -- one might even say 'pretty' -- vocals.I would not call this an ""essential"" disc, though it as highly recommended as any disc short of that level can be."
5,Great!,"On 9/21/99, as I walked in Vintage Vinyl (an area record store), I had never heard of Stereolab. Well, they were playing the record, and I thought it sounded awesome. I asked, ""Who is this?"", and they said, ""Oh, new Stereolab. Just came out today."" I ended up buying it. The music is sooo relaxing. I wish they were more famous 'cause none of my friends have heard of them."
5,Songwriting is Back,"The key to why this one is so much better than Dots is the songwriting. Although the space jazz textures of the two are very similar, Dots had like one memorable song, whereas Cobra has almost a dozen. I especially love Emergency Kisses, Milky Night, Blips, Fuses.I think this groop has raised my expectations so high that there are very few other bands that I can stand listening to any more."
1,"Obnoxious, mouthy, spoiled brats","Watch how these boys act. If you think it'd be funny for your kids to talk to you that way and carry on in such a sexualized manner, buy it for further family study. Few years of your preteens behaving that way really isn't normal, although it's made to look that way with that whole Disnified sheen.We have kids that age and younger it's virtually the only show they are prohibited from watching. Zach and Cody are bad for kids."
4,I've been using this item daily for 10 years,"I was a little shocked to see this ancient (by consumer electronics standards) product still for sale. I bought mine in Japan over ten years ago and still use it daily. I was also shocked to see a price point of $199. I don't remember what I paid for it but I doubt it was that much even 10 years ago. As a product it's been fine. It's compact and portable and puts out very good sound for its size. The one-button daylight savings time change is handy. On the downside, the display is hard to read from across a room and the controls are a little less than intuitive."
5,Portable CD/radio,"This the second one of this player I have purchased from this dealer. So, I was more than satisfied with the item and service. I recomend both the player and the seller. ldm1075"
1,Horrible heroine,"The story line itself is good. I loved Quinn! As mentioned in the previous review, there is a role reversal...and a horrible one it is! Rowena is annoying, irritable and intent on making things harder for herself when she could have it easy.She is offended that Quinn may be just another man after her body, yet she is the one who wanted a no strings affair with him.She is an arrogant and highly annoying heroine and completely ruined the book for me."
3,good product,You can get this /like it product anywhere.nothing special to note other than it was solid to use if no counter/support.
2,frustrating,"first, this clipboard has ruler markings down the sides, which the image online does not show. i had hoped for a plain clear clipboard, and i feel misled by the image posted on amazon, which advertises a clear board.second, this clipboard arrives in plastic packaging that's impossible to fully remove. you cannot succeed in fully extricating the plastic wedged between the board and the underside of the clip (which you can see, since this board's clear).all in all, it's not a bad price, and it works, but it also disappoints."
3,Heavy-handed Bach,"This recording seems to me to be awfully heavy-handed,played on a piano which is too broad sounding to capturethe intricate voicing of the fugues. Ashkenazy plays thepreludes quite well, but in my very humble opinion thefugues really suffer here. I would strongly suggest themore recent Hewitt set over this one.Also, an annoying feature of this recording is thesplit of the material onto three CDs. This can make ithard to find particular preludes or fugues."
4,Not heavenly but close.,"Traffic/ Heaven is in your mind (i.e., Mr. Fantasy)-(16 track edition): ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" is the big hit on this album but the entire CD is a excellent example of late 1960's British Rock. It certainly is an album of its time and some may find it sounding dated but the artistry of Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, and Mason is undeniable. Better albums were to come from Traffic, but this album is certainly worth owning."
4,Lives up to its name!,"The hi-flyer lives up to its name, a bit too well! I put it together so carefully and painted it this cool yellow on black pattern. Just after the paint dried I ran out to the field to launch it. We did a few test launches on a different low flying rocket, just to get a sense of the wind conditions. It was dead calm. Unable to constrain myself I loaded a C6 and launched. I barely saw it go up, and never saw it again. Great model and a real thrill, just don't put too much effort into it!"
4,Made our 11yo nephew very happy,He's addicted. Fairly easy to assemble with adult help. Fairly easy to recover. Find a big field on a calm day though as this one goes high!
3,could be good,Mine arrived with a slightly bent tube so the packaging could have been better. I recommend having a fin aligner for assembly. I made these away from my house and my estimated fin alignment caused me to lose a lot of altitude at launch.
5,Sound Off Your Name,"If you liked their first CD ""Bandshell"" then you will instantly fall in love with this one on the first beat. If it's even possible they managed to create and even better CD with more energy and meaning.As expected these boys put together another masterpiece of music. Augie, Jimmy, Dan and Tommy know what's good and they give it to the fans. A blast from first to last you will love every song on here. Some of the most popular titles are, "" Ballad Song"", ""Sound Off"", and ""Make Believe"". Dan's "" You Never Let Me Go"" is intense and unique. So check it out and play it loud!!To The Band: I Love you guys!"
2,WARNING: Requires FCC License for most channels!,"Channels 1-7 and 15-22 are 1.0 watt GMRS channels and require an FCC license, which is at least $80 and a lot of paperwork. The exterior of the package does NOT warn you about this.The FCC license requirement is not specific to this radio; it almost certainly applies to many other radios labeled FRS/GMRS.After I got my GMRS license and used the radio, I found that the sound quality and reception were lousy. Our local earthquake preparedness group practices at a school. We're never more than about 200 yards apart, and we have trouble understanding each other when we use these. (Yes, there's often a building between us, but it's only a 1-story building and none of us very close to it.)Basically, these are lousy and the packaging is misleading."
1,"So, So content",The book is a introductory exposition to Retinal Diseases. Not meant for serious practitioners.
1,Tastes like dog food,"A relative gave this to our household. It looks and tastes like dog food. Smells like it to. Since chicken alfredo is my favorite food I have tasted many during my lifetime. And this is the worst one I have ever tasted. It's as if a shipment of animal products and human food got mixed up, and it LOOKS like our dog's meals. I ended up giving the rest to him and he lapped it up. I would not buy this for humans."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be..,"I like buying the dark children's books to add to my son's collection. So I was excited to receive this particular book.. But the story line just is not there. The entire book basically just goes through the house and says ""in a dark dark corner there was a shelf?"" and then the next page ""in that dark dark corner on that shelf there was a .."" and mind you that is actually not from the book but it is exactly like that... and the ending took me by surprise so I kind of sat there and wanted to laugh because I have no idea how this book got published. But the illustrations are amazing ,so I gave it two stars for that. I am not sure what my son will think of it because he's to young to care right now. But it is not as great as some of the other books I have bought. I would skip this purchase."
4,Meow...A Dark Dark Tail,"A friend recommended we purchase this book for our 2 year old. We did and she loves it. I thought it might scare her, but it was quite the opposite. She points out the rabbits, owls and cats throughout the book and laughs when she sees the mouse at the end. A truly great book and a quick ""read"" too."
3,Good when it works,"I bought 2 a month or so ago, one was perfect and the other was having intermittent noise problem. Getting replacement from Amazon was truely hassle free.I own another 2 for about 3 years now, one still works perfectly, but the other one is not quite - microphone died so I can't use speaker phone.I think it is a great product, has all the basic feature I am looking for, but certainly has quality issue.Update: Another one died."
1,"Bad phone, awful service, don't buy!!!","I wish Amazon has a zero star, that is what my experience is with this phone I bought here. I bought this phone, the one I received would not hang up and did not work for a minute. I called Panasonic and had to hassel them for a pre-paid return label. I sent the phone back and expected to get another new phone. Instead I got an old, ""refurbished"" phone with previous owner's sticker still on it, and worse still, the phone would not hang up either! When I called the customer service, again, they said the best they could do was to send me another shipping label and send me another ""refurbished"" phone. At this point, I am inclined to throw the phone away and declare a total loss."
4,Not bad.,"This is a great little phone for the most part.1)The buttons are not tiny, so you won't be pressing the wrong numbers by mistake.2)The digital readout is good, but after about two years it begins to fade a bit.3)The sound quality is clear.4)The cord is way too short though. You have to be sitting right next to the phone. But I simply replaced it with a longer cord.5)Programing is not too complicated, but keep the manual nearby for when you have to re-program numbers. It is not simple enough to remember how to do it easily.But it is better than most other phones I have used. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a new phone."
1,Great appearance but bad design wrt battery use,"This phone looks great, feels solid and sounds well. However the unit I purchased won't keep working for over 2 hours of actual use (even w/o using the speakerphone) on 3 AA cells. It appears to drain the cells after 2 hours of actual use. Using new cells works but the same problem appears. After reading horror stories about refurbished units being sent back as ""repaired units"" by Panasonic I'm reluctant to go through the hassle of shipping it to them for warranty repairs. I'd write this off as a loss due to bad design."
4,It's O.K. but not Great!,"I got the ""Speaker Phone"" for it's speaker capability. Otherwise, it seems to be a convenient telephone."
2,OK but no caller ID,"Nowadays it is pretty much expected that a phone have caller ID. It has a display but no caller ID! Also, you have to set the clock manually whereas a lot of phones nowadays set themselves when someone calls (yes, a feature of caller ID). The sound quality is good and the phone is sturdy but it is missing a key feature that no one would expect that it didn't have."
5,Awesome addition,"It was very hard to find a corded phone to meet the requirements for this new at home job, but the panasonic KX-TS108W meets the requirements. It have the features that assist me to perform my tasks and the large keypad is a plus."
2,Just War Against Terror,"This book analyzes the role the United States has taken in certain situations where terror was a profound factor, internationally and nationally. It explains the strengths and weaknesses of the reaction of the government, and the logical steps which resulted in the reactions of the government and why they are so. It is an OK read, the author tends to drag."
1,just being against terrorism dose not make the war just.,The author oversimplified in analysing a more complicated topic than she can handle. Just like what I put down as the title of this review: Being against terrorism only does not justify every single military action against any suspect of your choice. The author needs more training in the areas of law and morality.
4,Homo Non-Sapiens,"With ""Human to Be,"" Sunny Seherr-Thoss joins her voice with the good company of eco-biologists such as Niles Eldridge (see this reviewer's review of ""Dominion"") in warning mankind of the self-inflicted risks to our survival as a species. In an innovative and creative stroke, the author, representing mankind, addresses the reader in the first person, and we are not remotely comfortable with this provocative self-awareness. She coins the term ""homo non sapiens"" to refer to the disconnect between how we should relate to our planet and how we actually do. Prepare yourself for a re-evaluation of the social contract, and for a re-appraisal of your values. And if you thought you'd read the last word in the debate between self-reliance and entitlement, read on."
4,Jumping hour,"Cheap jumping hour watch. Chinese fabrication, but nice concept. Only, the jumping digits are too small."
2,Not the item pictured!,The belt is not the one pictured at least not the buckle. The buckle is smaller and cheaper. The belt itself is flimsy. Once you put equipment on it the belt flops all directions if held and not on your waist. So far it hasn't broken which is the only other thing I can say about it. I bought this just for the buckle to replace that style buckle on a different belt. The buckles are not interchangeable.
1,What a waste of time,"Would be a great belt if it could fit through the loops on jeans. As it stands, too much trouble to use."
5,slammin,"This album is a joy to listen to, every song puts you into a different mood. The variety of music styles are placed well. Playground should keep on recording more albums of this style. Continued success."
1,"Great Scanner, Horrible Company","I purchased this scanner new about a year before xp came out.It worked great until I had to upgrade to xp. Once I got xp I could not find any drivers, and they do not offer xp support.I looked on their website and to get help for the visioneer 6100 you have to pay 2$ a minute on the phone by calling a 1-900 number because it is an older model scanner.They also do not respond to my emails asking them for support.Unless your running windows 98 or 95 this product will not work for you, and I highly recommend against this company.I refuse to ever buy another product from them again, since they are too lazy to write new drivers for new operating systems.I give them 2 thumbs down. What a waste of my money."
1,Horrible Product!,"Completely useless, bad quality, clunky, and doesn't support anything but Win 98. I tried to download the updated drivers and all I got was a corrupt file error. Don't waste your money!"
1,xp incompatible,I had Windows Me and this scanner worked great until I had to upgrade to xp. Now it doesn't work. There aren't any upgrades or fixes available from the company. It's impossible to figure out how to make this compatible with xp. Forget about it unless you are using an old operating system!
1,Read review below as well,"I already reviewed the red press however I thought I better review this one as well. Katz from Philly, below, beat me to it. Please read both reviews--this is a poorly designed product, My original review for the red press:I bought the Cuisinart for the name. Big mistake. After mashing the garlic, the little basket is consistently pulled out and PLOP! falls right into the food you merely wanted garlic in. So....if it falls into very hot olive oil, it can splash onto your hand and you have to quickly find something to pull the basket out of the oil. Bottom line, be forewarned----clever design in the boardroom, very poor design for the kitchen!"
3,The set could have been better.,"Buster Keaton is great, but the condition of the films is not. I feel that an extensive restoration should been prepared before these films hit blu-ray! Also, the organ music by Ben Model is awful, it sounds like you're at the circus. It stinks. The other music seems hap-hazzard at the best of times too. Keaton is always fun to watch. But the poor quality of the films really shows badly in blu-ray."
5,BUSTER KEATON Short Films,I had my doubts about what the quality would be for an old silent collection of 1920's films but I was very surprised at this great B/R transfer so I got THE GENERAL (Buster Keaton)and wow on my 150 inch screen this must be better than when first shown in theaters. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
5,A pure joy for all Keaton fans,"This is long overdue. The great Stone Face getting the quality DVD treatment he so richly deserves. All of the great Buster Keaton short film classic like ""Cops"", ""Palceface"", ""The Goat"", ""His Wife's Relations"", ""The Boat"" and others have been given new life and have never looked better. Personally, I would have loved to seen all of the films in this set been digitally remastered, but the ones that are like ""Cops"" have the look of a current new release. One of the more interesting aspects in the Special Features is to see clips from other comics tried to imitate Keaton including the great Stan Laurel. Still, there will be only one Buster Keaton and this is a must for all films fans of all ages."
5,Christianity parallels,"This series was great, but I especially liked this last book. The way it parrellels the story of Christ is interesting, and kind of makes you think. Think in kind of herectical terms but at least it evokes thought. I would suggest it for anyone who has been analyzing their faith."
5,A satisfying ending...,"Sometimes it is tough to maintain a high level of action and detail and suspense over a trilogy, but Dave Duncan has surpassed my expectations! The final book of the series is excellent... it ties together all loose ends from the trilogy and ends with a few bangs rather than one. It was a completely satisfying experience to read The Great Game trilogy. Duncan's many-layered approach is thought-provoking as well as entertaining. I highly recommend all three books."
1,Out of gas...,"After a terrific first book (Past Imperative), a passable second book (Present Tense), DD phones this one in. An extremely disappointing novel, managing to make the reader become completely indifferent towards his characters. Part of this is the indifference that DD shows himself, disposing and ignoring characters he spent time building up in the previous two novels.As for the plot itself, it's reminiscent of a classic computer game: Populous (and it's modern recasting: Populous the Beginning. Hero goes around gathering followers, performing some unethical things to gather more followers, has big battle with villain doing the same thing. Interesting, but soulless.To make it even worse, DD tires the reader's patience by taking up hundred of pages to get to a confused ending which makes you yearn for the Planet of the Apes (2001)."
2,The Great *YAWN*,"Ok, major disappointment here. I LOVE the other series that Dave has written, but this one fell on it's face. The 'thrilling' climax at the end of the book takes up about 1/2 page, and it's as told by someone who saw it, not the actual event.... COME ON Dave, you can do better than thi!"
2,Disappointing finish to promising premise,"Duncan has taken a very promising world and premise and bogged it down in a repetitive, cliched, and way, way, too somber a plot. He also shows an annoying habit of introducing too many characters, giving tons of background information about them, allowing readers a peek into their personalities, and then disposing of them (or ignoring them for the rest of the series). Take my advice, read the first two books (or even just the first) and skip this one. Any ending you dream up is bound to be better than this one."
2,Nice phone -- crazy battery problems,"I hope I never own another Panasonic phone. The phone is nice and has nice features, but the &*!$ battery. I can pick up the phone and it is indicating full battery. Start the call and the phone beeps at me, the battery indicates 'Low', and 'No Link to Base' appears. The phone has been well taken care of AND I have experienced this problem with 3 Panasonic phones. I hate to bash -- but after dealing with these phones -- stay away from Panasonic."
1,Batteries go dead after 4 months,"We have had this phone since November of 2002 when it came out. Since then, every 4 months we have had to replace the batteries. Not only do the reviews at Amazon document this problem, but just put in KX-TG2740S in the internet explorer search bar and there are scores of complaints from other unhappy users.The rest of the phone was terrific in all respects, but at approximately $40 every 4 months (to replace the batteries), we could buy a new phone every year, which, actually is what we just did.I spoke to the Panasonic rep over the phone, and she had a canned response to all my questions, as if she had had numerous complaints regarding this issue before. If anyone would like to start a class action lawsuit regarding this defective product (or know of a class action lawsuit already in progress) I would be happy to join!"
1,Fed Up,"Other reviews mention the battery life as being the primary problem. My problem has been the display on the handset. Within 2 weeks of usage the handset display is blank making it virtually useless. I'm currently on the 3rd and last attempt, I've phoned Panasonic customer service and they act as if I'm the only one having problem, their of no help what so ever.Now that I have read the previous reviews I know that this is just a bad phone.I'm returning this last unit and giving up, even with all the great features, it's not worth the cost or incovenience."
1,Extremely Disappointing Phone System,"This phone has several issues, including frequent out of range messages, incoming calls cannot be answered, and all lights blinking all the time on the base unit.1. The cordless phone complains that it is out of range. You could be standing in front of the base unit, but it still does not reconnect. You have to place it back on the unit and wait.2. Incoming calls cannot be retrieved on the cordless phone. You can hear the phone ringing, but when you answer the call, you will not be reception. Again, you have to place the phone back on the unit.3. Frequently, all of the lights on the base unit blinks. You have to unplug it and then wait.I've called Panasonic to see if they are willing to help with it but they will charge for everything.You should not purchase this phone."
3,mediocre,"For the price that one pays for these phones one would expect superb reliability and quality. These phones work well, the only draw back is that after several months all handsets begin to malfunction. They will turn off while you try to dial a number, and or freeze up while a call is coming in and it is ringing. We called Panasonic and were informed the batteries needed to be replaced. This seems a little silly that the batteries need to be switched out every several months. I would not recommend this phone, instead consider another manufacturer or perhaps a different model. The glitches could just be specific to this series, as I have had other Panasonic products and they have been great."
4,panasonic kx-tg2740s,"This is a good phone. I have had it for three years, I use it in my business. ITS BEEN DROP A THOUSAND TIMES, STILL WORKS the ony draw back is the battery, but there are good replacements out there. don't pass up because of battery (YOU CAN HEAR REAL CLEAR)THE VIEW SCREEN COULD BE LARGER."
3,volume transmit problems,"Hi, I bought this phone 2nd hand on EBay (I'm in Australia and you can't buy a 2 line phone here, new or used).Regarding the battery issue, I was advised to put some cardboard in the battery cavity to put pressure on the connectors to get a better charge, and I've had no problem, fingers crossed.Answering machine sound is clear.HOWEVER!!nearly all the people we talk to have trouble hearing us. We can hear them exceptionally well, the clarity for us is amazing, but not the reverse.PLEASE, can anyone help us with this problem??Thanks!"
4,Great Phone system But need to modify battery,The phone system is great. The battery issue surfaced shortly after I got the system-one bas and 2 extensions. if you move the phone around too much it looses battery power-the power just drops to almost zero. The fix was to hard wire the battery. I soldered the battery connections. Once I did this the phones all lasted along time on battery. If I use the speaker phone on the handsets I get over an hour on it. If I use the phones regular method (not speaker phone) I get hours on a charge.
2,Many good features and many not so good,"Will only mention the features I didn't care for:1) Does not have speed dial. Has directory search which takes longer than keying in the number from a list.2) Message record time is limited to 15 minutes including outgoing msgs which is too short for a 2-line phone used for a small business.3) Listening to msgs doesn't tell you which line the call came in on.4) The base screen is difficult to read if it is not tilted up toward you. Also difficult to read small print of the number of msgs.5) Battery is NicCad, not NicHyd, therefore it holds memory.6) Cannot go back and listen to a portion of a msg, only repeat the entire msg. This is inadequate for long customer orders. It does have ""slow talk"" playback but this is not the solution."
1,Good phone but zero battery life,"Before I mention some of the phone's good qualities, I must state that I too have horrible battery life. This phone, even after replacing the battery, will only stay on for 10-20 minutes. If you leave it off the charger overnight, the next day it will be dead.The phone, when it does work, has good sound quality during calls. The plastic buttons are large but they are too smooth and slippery. I would prefer a more silicone-like material and grip to them. Menu system is easy to use. If it weren't for that major battery problem, this could be a 4 or 5 star phone. This phone should come w/ a corded phone to use while your phone is charging."
2,Bad experience..,"Initially I thought this was a great phone with nice features. The first problem was that it wouldn't charge. Panasonic support said they would send new batteries in 2 days. A week later I got an envelope with 2 pieces of velco to put in the battery compartment. There was no explanation of why the velcro instead of batteries. Range was poor, sound was scratchy. It took it back for a refund."
1,Very bad battery life,"I have had this phone for over 2 years now. I already replaced the first one I purchased thinking that it was a defective unit. Now I have already replaced the battery in my 2 handsets. What bother me the most about this phone is that the batter indicator shows full battery and I soon as I received a call and try to answer it go dead on me. So I go running around the house looking for other phones to answer my call before the VM picks up. When the phone work which is right after recharging the battery, it is good. I love the speaker phone and the LCD which are the main reasons I bought this phone.Anyway, I won't suggest this phone to anyone. I am now researching another phones because I am just sick of it."
2,Bad batteries small display,Worked (OK) for a couple months. Batteries got progressively short charge. Display is so small and poorly lit. Tried to contact tech support - no response. Hard to find a good pickle!
1,Not good at all,"Very disappointed with this phone - after about a month, the display died and only comes on once in a blue moon. So much for caller ID. Also, after about 6 months, the battery stopped holding a charge very long. I considered getting another expandable handset, but I ended up buying a different phone."
1,Stay away from this phone!,This phone has a lot of great features BUT the battery situation is what makes it a bad investment. The batteries in this phone do not hold a charge . They recommend that you do not put your phone down on the charger until it needs to be recharged otherwise it will lose it's ability to keep a charge. Believe them. I have replaced batteries already and the same thing is happening to the second set. I am looking to replace the whole system with another company. Hundreds of dollars down the drain.
1,Possible battery solution,"Am interested in getting this phone system, but the battery problem seems to be the major issue. I found a NiMH 1200 mah replacement battery .... this should work better than the NiCad, but I have not tried it yet. Panasonic has no NiMH listed on there ... ""Telephone Battery Cross Reference Chart"" for this phone. As the phone otherwise would suit the purpose and have had reasonable use from an older 900 mhz pan, I may give it a try - I'll report back."
1,Unreliable answering machine,Amazon.com has a great price on this phone. I bought it and just spent several hours setting it up. I found that the electronic menu would be impossible for a non-tech person to deal with. Manual volume and ring settings would be useful (this is all electronic menu driven).Once set up my trial calls to leave messages did not always get recorded. Since I am using this for my business I cannot afford to have messages lost. This machine just doesn't make the grade.
1,horrible batttery life,"I've had this phone for about a year or less now and the battery life to this phone is really bad. I've followed the direction on how long to charge and when to charge it, yet the phone's battery still dies. For me the battery last's up to 45 minutes than it dies. So I have to wait another 6-8 hours of whatever it is to use the phone again after re-charge. Customers beware of this product. If only I could give this phone negative stars I would."
2,A pan of Panasonic,"I've had my phone for several years. The base unit audio quality is good, but battery life is about 20 minutes...even when replacement battary is installed. Use of speakerphone in base unit cuts off the phone. The second cordless unit works flawlessly; has a good range...but your callers have trouble hearing you...and many times you can't hear the caller. I continue to use the Panasonic because the AT&T system I had purchased before from Staples crapped out within two weeks...and the attitude of the customer service folks was disgusting...and the cost of repair or replacement was more expensive than the purchase price. At least the Panasonic keeps working."
4,Just get new batteries immediately!!,This is a great phone system with horrible batteries. Get the Energizer p-511 and put them in immediately. If your battery says Panasonic- dump them- they are no good- your phones will just go blank at some point. Buy the new batteries at Target for $10 each and the system is great.I love it. I can put an extension in every room with 2 lines and never have to mess with jacks again. Good features and the whole system cost under $200 for 3 phones. Good deal and cheap for my business budget.
3,NiMH Batteries for your phone,I have had an an old Panasonic cordless for several years and it has been great. Now that I am in the market for a new phone I have been looking to them again. This phone really interests me except for the battery issue. With all the complaining by what I would call an internet savvy crowd (they did post opinions on Amazon) - I decided to due a battery search. Ten seconds on Google yielded an NiMH Battery for this phone at batteries.com. I have also read somewhere else that someone has used this succesfully (I think epinions - not sure). Anyway here it is - model number and all:Energizer ER-P511 Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone Batteryfor the Panasonic KX-TG2740SKnowing this I think I am still interested in the phone. I believe most people are satisfied with it if they leave out the battery problems.
1,Buyer Beware,"I have two cordless handsets and replaced the batteries. They constantly lose connection to the base set and the batteries from being new, wear down very, very, very fast. This phone cannot hold a candle to the preceeding product, the 2000B, but the CWID broke on that phone when still under an extended warranty. This phone is a POS!"
1,Terrible phone!,"Sound quality is bad, speaker phone is barely existant! It does have a good walking range on it though. Paid way too much for this hunk of junk, paint started flaking off after the second or third month also. Just simply a bad phone, not going near Panosonic for a long time!"
1,Do not buy. Batteries go dead,"I have base+phone and one extra handset.After using intensively for 6 months, one phone can only be used for 2 minutes, the other for 30 minutes and going down.Very disappointed that Panasonic puts out a low quality product like this."
1,"Buyer beware...better yet, stay away","I've gradually coming to the conclusion that it's impossible to buy a genuinely high-quality, two-line phone. This particular model makes me want to give up on buying telephones altogether, and revert back to my rotary phone, or two Dixie Cups and a string.Not only is the sound quality poor, but the batteries are horrible. I have two phones, and the battery life of each one is about 15-20 minutes, tops. I work from home, and by 11 a.m., both phones are usually shot -- forcing me to use my cell phone or, yes, hook up my old rotary phone. I just begrudgingly bought two new batteries: we'll see how they work. I assume they'll be horrible, as is everything else associated with this product.PS: I know two other people with the same phone system, and they have similar complaints. My system worked well for a little more than a month, and then that was that."
3,"Great Features, HORRIBLE Battery Life","This phone has it all. The features are some of the best that I've ever seen on a wireless phone. However, the battery life is HORRIBLE. If a fully charged phone is taken off the charger, it will last only 3 days max (without any use what so ever). If you use the phone for more than 20 minutes, the battery almost completely discharges. As a result my handsets are always on the charger; which almost makes the idea of a wireless phone useless."
1,Worst experience with this crap,"Bought the phone and 2 handsets. Same battery problems as everybody. The battery lasts only for a 30min call or something. But the worst is here:Often this sh.t dies and the display shows ""NO LINK TO BASE. WALK CLOSER AND TRY AGAIN"" even if you are NEAR the base.Other problem:Only one ""low battery warning"" beep...so if it sounds you have to run to get the other handset or you will lose the call.I said I'll never buy any other Panasonic TV but with this I WONT BUY ANY OTHER PANASONIC DEVICE"
1,Poor quality,This is the second Panasonic cordless phone we've purchased in the last two years and they've both been terrible. The battery life is very poor. The phone goes dead and has to be completely recharged if you try to use the speaker phone feature. If it's off it's cradle for more than an hour the battery only lasts 15 minutes. Panasonic would not replace either phone we purchased. They had very poor customer support.
4,HP 3500C Scanjet,I have used this type scanner for several years. It does about average job scanning items how ever it is slow on start up. I like the features of the HP director folder. Can not be used for faxing documents.
1,Another HP Scanner in the garbage,"This is my 2nd HP scanner. The first was the top of the line scanner of 1999. After a year it just stopped working. The bed lit up but then it would say ""cannot find scanner."" Even HP tech support couldn't figure it out. I got this one for Xmas, used it a handful of times, now I get a strange clicking sound and no scanned product. HP is sending me a new one... Maybe I should just buy a digital camera instead....... I will steer clear if HP scanners from now on..."
5,Profound photography,"The photos are quite profound - and erie... It's a glimpse into the public and private lives of people you don't know, yet intrigue you. It's kind of mezmerizing. I found myself intrigued by a photo, then I'd flip to the description in the back of the book, and then back-again to the photo with a more learned eye. The nighttime lighting reflects the harshness of what's happening..."
4,"Just the fax, man...","If you're looking for a fax for your home office and don't want to spend a fortune, this is the fax for you. It is simple to set up, uses plain copy paper and takes up little space. The only down side is, it wasn't compatible with our voicemail system and we can't use the auto answer mode. Since we mostly use this for outgoing faxes, we're fine. We just have to manually switch it over to fax mode to receive. If you need the auto answer, check the specs carefully before you buy this one."
2,paper jams,"I had a earlier model so I thought when it was time to get a new one I would purchase another Brother. I bought this one for our home office because it said it had 10 page faxing ability. The print quality is the same as the previous model, which is low, but standard for fax machines. The trouble is, if you want to fax multiple pages, the machine jams. You need to stand there, when it is faxing, to make sure the paper is feeding straight. I have found it impossible to fax more than 3 pages at one time and even with this the paper jams."
2,Another fax with sending problems,"I have only used this fax for about 2 months and it does a terrible job sending. I don't fax a lot, maybe 2-10 pages per day. It always jams and has trouble feeding my faxes through, irritating!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"We have this machine in a public library where we send faxes for both patrons and ourselves. This machine has been trouble since Day One. I have called Brother's customer service, and they were no help. The machine jams constantly. To send ANY fax, we have to stand over the machine and babysit it to make sure the paper feeds correctly. It just will not consistently feed straight. Every once in a while it works beautifully, but most of the time my staff is really frustrated when they ""get"" to send a fax for someone. Stay away from this machine. The price may be right, but you will pay out the wazoo with frustration."
1,Frustrating paper jammer,"Never been more disappointed in a fax before...and never had the problems this one has given with other machines. Most faxes sent are only 1 page but it is almost guaranteed that it will take several attempts, lots of luck, and several minutes on average to get a fax through without it being jammed, turned sideways, or just plain not going through. If a negative 5 star rating were available, that's where this one would belong...bummer."
4,It's worked ok,"We at the office just had our first problem with it after over a year, while trying to send a fax it got stuck on receive mode, we called Brother and after 5 mins on hold we were helped, apparently we just needed to lift the paper to be faxed from the machine to release the receive mode it was on.Everything else works out well, hope this is helpful, cheers."
1,A Jammin' Machine,"This fax machine has given us nothing but trouble.It jams repeatedly, and that creates a lot of wasted time and effort.It jams so frequently that you have to stand over it and monitor every individual page being faxed to make sure it goes through. Even then, we often find ourselves having to make 3 or 4 attempts before it faxes without jamming.We had a 2800 Intellifax, which worked great. When it wore out, we replaced it with this machine. We should have stuck with that model for our replacement."
5,Excellent,It was simple to install. Works like a charm. To copy and to fax. Very very happy with my purchase.
1,jammed up,The Brother 1270e Fax machine is always jamming. Extremely slow and usually have to make several attemtps at sending a fax before it connects and sends the message. Don't consider this one.
2,Fax Died after light use..,"I've had this product for 2 years at home and it is lightly used. When the print was light and there was a black line vertically down the page, I assumed it was time for a new printer cartridge. I bought and installed a new one with no improvement. Talked with Brother on phone, cleaned roller. Was referred to local repair shop and it will cost more to diagnose and repair than replace. What a piece of junk!!"
5,review of Brother fax,"Brother Fax 1270e is a replacement for an earlier version of the machine that, after 15 years, gave up. It uses the same cartridge as the earlier one and works very well. Reasonably priced, friendly and streamlined."
4,A very interesting book!,"Harold and Maude is an interesting book. The story is also funny and very serious. At first a had a problem to understand Harold, the death- obsessed 20-year-old man-child who spends his free time attending funerals and staging fake suicides in front of his motherMaude was the opposite of Harold. She introduces him to the wonders and possibilities of life. In this story I understand Maude more than Harold, but what she did on her eightieth birthday is very sad. I have never thought that she will commit suicide."
5,Well written book!,"'Harold and Maude' is a very well written book. It's about a love story between a young boy and an old lady. But it's not just the question how they find another, it's the question how they do it! Maud teaches Harold a lot like that life is wonderful and that everybody is unique! But don't think the story is just romantic and philosophical, it's also very funny. You will have a lot to laugh about when you read it. All the people are strange but lovable. They all have some traits. Harold's mother who treats Harold like a baby, or Harold how commits suicide to shock his mother and his future wives.All in all you have your fun reading this book!"
4,An extraordinary couple,"I really liked to read this book, because it's a refreshing story about a couple who is very different in age and in their opinions, but on the other hand, I mean in their special relationship to the world and mankind they agree together, or rather they complement one another. They experience many interesting and funny adventures together, but unfortunately the end is a bit foreseeable."
5,Harold and Maude,"Wonderful to be able to lay my hands on this. In a documentary of this and other films made about the same time, they said it was made and quickly forgotten. Not by me nor, I think, by many others. Very black humour. Received in good condition."
5,Harold and Maude,"It was a very good book, because it had a bit of everything, it was funny, sad, strange and amazing. It was full of surprises and there were so many things to learn about life. I really liked it. I also very enjoyed see the film - it was marvelous! In company with the film, the book is much easier to understand. There was Maude who showed Harold the sunny side of live and otherwise there was Harolds mother who thaught she knew him better than Harold himself. The good side has won. Thanks Maude who helped him to liberate himself from his mother and to go his own way... it was a brilliant story!"
4,histroy book,Book works well for making notes etc. Easier to carry around than hard cover for school bags. Makes studier much easier
3,Better than average Freshman effort.,"The album begins with a punch to the solar plexus.(Pushin) This is a hard driving alternative yet positive song with tight drum work and just enough ragged edge to keep you on it. But the album sort of unravels soon thereafter. The tempo and melody on The Dances are horribly mismatched with Daniel Creach's phenomenal vocals. It seems like they're selling suffering for suffering's sake. Anger seems more appropriate. However, Fly is the answer to that. The true emotion that went into the lyrics is displayed in the delivery. Beautiful! Overall, not a disappointing album."
4,A Collector's Piece.....,"I bought this piece for my fiance who is a huge FF buff, I thought it would make a nice add on to his collection. The time is off by about an hour (It is supposed to auto set the Vana'diel [game] time when you input your current [earth] time/zone information.) Only thing I can think of is that it might not work with daylight savings time. The LCD screen also has to be placed somewhere with a light colored background, it's not the easiest to see.Overall though, he likes it as a collector's piece and therefore it was worth the cost."
3,good clock that will help u in ffxi,as i said before it is a good and will help u so that u know the ingame time for some NM and some of the HQ crafts and u can also make alarms for the air ships or for anything u want to do after somtime in game also it have a good sounds of the alarms**** but ;) (i always like this part)the clock should be improved like the sounds of the clock it is only mid and they should make it as mp3 for high quality sounds and they should make an always timing for the departure of ships from and to rather using the alarms to do this things i donot want to tell some advices that they should know by them self specialy after the last expansionbut ;) (this is the last but lol)in general it will help u unless if u donot have extra money to to spend it .
3,I can't look at these images anymore,I'm a professional medical illustrator. I had aspired to attain the quality of the Pernkopf illustrations but it is a fact thatmany of bodies here were almost certainly holocaust victims. Perversely he leaves enough of the outer body to recognize individuals. It's a little hard to open up the book now.
1,But he was a Nazi,"I'm sure he was a great artist, but his models were Nazi Holocaust victims being held in concentration camps. The controversy is not over. This book is out of print for good reason. Thanks to modern technology, we do not need to rely on a genocide contributor's sketches to show us what the human body looks like."
1,"Eduard Pernkopf: Morally bankrupt, Nazi, Hitler fanatic,and Eugenicist","""To assume the medical care -- with all your professional skill -- of the body of the people which has been entrusted to you, not only in the positive sense of furthering the propagation of the fit, but also in the negative sense of eliminating the unfit and defective. The methods by which racial hygiene proceeds are well known to you: control of marriage, propagation of the genetically fit whose genetic, biologic constitution promises healthy descendants: discouragement of breeding by individuals who do not belong together properly, whose races clash: finally, the exclusion of the genetically inferior from future generations by sterilization and other means."" -- Eduard Pernkopf (Pernkopf's quote from whonamedit.com website, [...]What kind of doctor is this? His views go against the Hippocratic Oath. What's wrong with boycotting Pernkopf's book and those who publish it? Not boycotting it, would only encourage future Pernkopfs."
1,Beres Hammond Reggae Max,"Some great tracks by Beres, but the record label needed to remaster this joint, the sound quality stinks. Wait for the Best of Beres."
5,A good little diversion,"A lot of fun and, unfortunately, you don't have to go very far when traveling in the Middle East or Africa to see some entertaining signs (and I'm not just talking ""camel xing"" either). I'm glad someone thought to put this collection together!"
3,not as funny as signspotting 2,"this one had a few good ones, but not as funny as signspotting 2. that one has laugh out loud humor"
4,Not for the easily offended,"I read this book with my tween sons and we got lots of good laughs out of it. There is some mildly inappropriate stuff that we flipped quickly past. If you're offended by signs that unintentionally read sexhibit and sexchange or signs with foreign words/place names that resemble ""naughty"" words in English, then maybe this isn't the book for you.My biggest complaint is the small print. The picture captions were hard enough to read, but the author's general musings were printed on a yellow background - so the poor contrast exacerbated the problems with small print. And I wish the book had page numbers!"
3,Short but Sweet,"Amusing book, a little short, but packs quite a few laughs in. Its great to just sit out to let a friend read. For this price, its worth it."
5,"Perfect for 6 months of files, month-by-month","NOt the sexiest item in the stack, but they work great with a two-hole punch."
1,"Not worth the money, falling apart","Beware dont buy this product, very low quality, the seam is very thin and cant handle the papers you put in them, tore the first time i used i, very un happy!"
5,Heavy Duty Folders,"I use them for my work in the field and they really heavy-duty and substantial. I like the yellow folders better than the red as they seem to have a ""waxy"" finish which repels moisture better."
3,Helpfull yet Frustrating,"This software has been helpful to me in doing my own Living Trust, Pour Over Will, Living Will, etc. . It is pretty straight forward, yet has been frustrating at times when something that should work isn't. For example, it refuses to fill in my name or my wifes name when i select either of us from a list (in any of its build your document through questions sections), but will fill in everyone else. It does still let you edit the final document to fix this, but i have had to hand edit it."
2,decepción,"En primer lugar quiero dejar constancia que compré este disco por la presencia de Trey Gunn. Este hecho y el anuncio de una explosiva mezcla de jazz, rock y música progresiva me hizo albergar esperanzas. Tras una primera escucha te das cuenta que la tan cacareada mezcla se queda en un mero disco de rock de los que hay miles. Rock ramplón y plano en el que el papel de Trey Gunn es meramente anecdótico. Todo el disco gira en torno a Percy Howard, un vocalista del que reconozco me total desconocimiento y cuya única virtud es poseer un timbre de voz parecido al Bowie más crooner. Lo dicho un disco del montón."
3,Heavy but a nice piece,"I really like this pot but I find that I do not use it as often as my enamel and steel pot because its just too heavy. I love that it doesn't use a non stick coating but food still slides right off. One down side is in the design, you must dry this pot immediately or the rim will slightly rust. I contacted the manufacture about this problem and they did not respond back to me. I would rate it a 4 star if it had a coating to protect from rust."
5,Awesome!,"This album is amazing. It is one of the best I've heard from any artist in the past couple years. Lyrically it is intelligent and moving, like all of McDermott's work. Musically, this is one of his most satisfying albums. It maintains a roots-rock foundation, but offers a wide variety of styles that keep repeated listenings fresh. Ashes has had a near permenant home in my cd player since I got it in May. Wether you are a long time fan or a newcomer to Michael McDermott, I highly recommend checking out Ashes."
5,Ken Schultz's Fishing Encyclopedia,What a great holiday gift for anyone who enjoys fishing or reading about any aspect of the subject. Schultz certainly is the definitive expert on this subject matter. Excellent photos and drawings as well as thoroughly researched topics make this an invaluable reference tool for anyone even remotely interested in the subject I don't think there's ANYTHING he's left out! I've gotten one for myself and three more as gifts.
1,Poor quality from the beginning,"I purchased this black ink cartridge after looking at multiple sources and reading the reviews of this particular product. Although the packaging appeared to be authentic, complete with a holographic type label, this cartridge performed poorly from beginning to end. No matter what settings I choose everything I printed came out gray, not black. Oftentimes it was hard to read the text it was so light. I would say I got about 30 pages out of this cartridge before finally throwing it in the trash. Next time I'm going to bite the bullet and buy a real HP ink cartridge from a real brick and mortar store that I don't have to worry about selling knockoffs or counterfeits."
1,Not the same quality,I've ordered HP Cartridges from Amazon in the past. I bought my last black #56 cartridge in August 2012. In the past these cartridges have lasted about a year with the amount of printing I do. This last one is only 2 month old and it's starting to run out of ink. I'm sorry I didn't heed other reviewers. I should have paid a little more money and bought the cartridge locally.The Cartridge I bought had been made in Malaysia. I'm not sure how you can make sure where the product is made but other HP Cartridges I've bought online and locally have never failed like this one. Amazon has stood behind this cartridge and made good on my purchase.
1,Where's the ink?,"I received this product in good condition, but when placed in my printer, nothing came out. I contacted the seller and was told I would receive another cartridge, but that never materialized. It was the product, because I bought one locally and it worked just fine."
1,Defective item,"I order this item to ensure quality. I didn't want a refurbished one. After I installed it in my printer it did not work at all. I did not get one print out of it. I just contacted the seller to see if a return is approved. If it is, I will be very happy to get my money back."
3,"Received HP ""56b Simple Black"" (???)","I ordered a standard HP 56 Black Ink Cartridge but what I received was something called HP 56b Simple Black. It was made in Singapore and had international/Asian labeling. It also expires in just 7 months. It remains to be seen if this cartridge will perform acceptably compared to the regular HP 56, but it is not what I expected to receive. The short expiry date is also troubling."
2,Printed fine... for a month,This cartridge stopped working after about 60 pages. The printer is now in reserve mode and I am annoyed since I paid for the oem cartridge.
4,Beautiful Photos,"I had an old Canon and it never produced anything good....but my new HP5550 is absolutely FANTASTIC! My photos look professional now. Lots of people use their ink very fast, but I guess I don't print as much as others? I just have trouble buying new cartridges....hard to find. All in all, I am extremely pleased with everything about my printer....love the 4x6 borderless photos!"
2,Disappointed - NOT PRODUCT IN DESCRIPTION,"Like others, I received the 56b, but I was not quick enough to catch it, and now am stuck with this inferior product. Also like others, I appear to be having difficulty printing with this and I worry I will not get nearly as many pages as a regular HP56. This is deceptive advertising! It should say it's a 56b!"
1,also received HP 56b cart.,"i usually read all the reviews for the products I buy, but I never thought I'd have to read the reviews for a genuine HP printer cartridge! Silly me, to think it would be a straightforward purchase.As others have noted, I also received the HP 56b cartridge, and on googling the cartridge, it does say that it's for 'basic printing'. What the heck does that mean? I returned it, and will be buying the 2 pack, and hoping for the best this time. I also bought it from Andrew's Printer Supply, or something like that, but it was FULFILLED BY AMAZON, so ultimately, I think it's Amazon's mistake."
1,Will not align,"Cartridge will not align, tried several times, same message, finally gave up. Had to buy another from local store. Did not expect timis will not work."
1,HP 56 Cartridge in Retail Pkg..DID NOT WORK!,"I usually order a HP57 and HP56 Combo Pack on-line from a Big Name Brand Store. Thought I would save some money ordering the HP 56 from Amazon (Bigg Buys LLC) and the HP 57 from another company on Amazon. The HP 56 simply won't work! I put the old, almost empty (purchased at a big name company) cartridge in the printer and all is well, put the ""new"" cartridge in...doesnt' work. Although it came in what looks like HP packaging...I'm not sure. I have never had a problem with true HP ink cartridges. I'm pretty sure I'm getting a refund from Amazon but...Lesson Learned...Knock offs everywhere."
3,Good once it's in. Can be messy to install due to printer.,"The printer design allows accumulation of crud so when you install this keep your fingers away from the cradle it rides in, otherwise it's OK."
1,Not HP brand & won't work.,"I received two ""hp"" cartridges. Neither were actually HP brand. They were generic. This black one doesn't work at all. The color seems ok although it's generic and not advertised as such."
1,Um.... I won't do this again...,"I thought I could save some money by buying cartridges online. I was wrong. I purchased two, and one of them was flawed and actually damaged my $150.00 printer (which had to be replaced). I have no idea how to return the cartridge, or if I even CAN return it... next time I will pay full price at Target."
4,Original Ink Cartridge,"I have not used the product yet, but feel tht original cartridges in original packages give me more security as to what I'm getting. With auto price checks and ease of amazon purchase and reasonable delivery time. It was a no brainer."
5,"In the case, the name brand is best","I have tried alternatives to the HP brand for printer ink, but every time I have problems with print quality. Generic cartridges left streaks or did not work at all, and refilling was painfully messy at best.Now I purchase only the HP brand printer cartridges for my HP printer. I have never had any problems with this style/brand/make of cartridge. Consistently, the ink is delivered crisply, clearly and without inconsistencies to my paper. No smudging, smearing or leaking. The only time there is ever an issue is when the ink gets too low-- time to change out the cartridge, obviously.These cartridges have a very easily identifiable numbering system. Getting the right size and type of ink is easy with HP's system. I appreciate that, for sure! Also, the cartridges are designed so that they are easy to install-- you just remove it from the package, peel off the tape and slide it into place in the printer... Can't get better than that, right?"
1,HP 56 Black Ink Cartridge,"I received my order in a timely manner. I received the HP 56 cartridge, but the expiration date was June 2010. It expired two and one half years before I received it! It does work so I gave it one star, but for how long? I will NEVER order from this vendor again! I will also tell my friends!"
5,It is what it is.,"If you need black ink for your HP printer, then here you go. Carry on. Get your black on, in spades."
4,fair price - fast ship,Bought this along with hard-to-find HP57+ HP58 cartridges (no local supply). Amazon shipped fast & I got everything in 3 days.Everything OK & Amazon will be my source for HP cartridges & my local charity get my old cartridges for recycling.
3,"Could be better, but could be worse!","I just recently purchases an HP5550 and the printer, despite some negative reviews on speed... is excellent. The Ink is another story altogether. The cartridges are very small and after 1 week of regular use (home business printing, 4 or 5 pictures on sample paper) the ink is almost 1/2 finished!!! This could be a problem in the end as the ink is more expensive than other printer manufacturers. I guess watching ink consumption is something HP did not warn us about!"
1,Check the supplier!!!!!,"I never have any issues with HP inks in general. My issue is with the supplier.Andrew's Genuine Supplies sent me HP 56b carts. These will fit, but will produce inferior (Draft Only) quality pages.I decided NOT to roll the dice on my lab equipment and opted to return them and buy from a more reliable supplier (Toner Planet to name one) and pay a couple of extra dollars per cart."
1,Bad no ink all dry empty,it come empty no ink may be sitting long at store ink was dry i never use .
5,the right cartridge at a good price,I was afraid my printer was dead but I tried one more cartridge and it works fine. The other cartridges I had on hand were dried up so that was why none of them worked. I hope this one lasts as long as it should.
5,Fit perfect,These are a perfect fit for my application. Getting hard to find these size bulbs. Sure glad they are still sold here. I would buy again.
1,smells funny,"I bought the Bee Flower rose soap and it came in a timely manner. I ordered it because of the rave reviews it got, but when it arrived I was disappointed. It has a funny smell to me. To me it smells cheap and is very overpowering. I used it once and the smell stays on skin for a good long while. I can't even use it because I find the smell so bad and I ordered two bars. Thank goodness I didn't spend a lot otherwise I would have been very bummed. I will not buy this brand again and would not recommend it."
4,"Can we say, ""Spot the Heinlein novels?""","What a treat to read a good juvenile by an author whose adult fiction I have enjoyed greatly! It was even more fun to spot the plot similarities to Heinlein novels. The introduction gave it away a little, but it was with glee that I found first ""RED PLANET,"" then ""THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS,"" and ""CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY."" The last one was so obvious that I found myself saying, ""Aw, gee, can you make more of a bow to the master?""A good yarn and one that you could give to your teenage to enjoy (after you read it yourself)."
5,"An excellent successor to R. A. Heinlein's ""juvenilles.""","An enjoyable read. Written as a juvenille, this one is fun for all ages. An obvious tribute to Heinlein, half the fun of this novel is picking out the links with the master's classic work like The Star Beast, Citizen of the Galaxy, Time for the Stars, and others. Yet this is an original novel, not a boring pastiche or faded copy of other works. It offers an excellent and original presentation of an alien life form/civilization, as well as an exciting plot. RAH would have loved it, and been glad to call it his own. One of the few works I've read to recapture the magic of the originals."
3,A bit disappointing,I read the reviews on your site and hearing this album was just a bit disappointing. I exected much more. His rendition of this type of song doesn't hold a candle to Domingo's. Many of the songs seems lifeless and rather amateurish. He should stick to what he does best and leave stuff like this to Domingo. He is however much better than other opera singers who try to sing this repetoire.
5,Great CD,Great singer... The album has a few of my favorite songs by mexican composers. It is nice to hear them with an awesome voice.
1,Cannot listen to this CD,"I bought this CD because I have very much enjoyed Flores in different operas. However, I could not listen to his singing of these beautiful songs. Instead, I listened to Placido Domingo's CD, De mi Alma Latina, in which the songs are beautifully orchestrated and masterfully sung by Domingo. That said, I would love to hear Flores sing Tu y Yo, the beautiful danza Puertorriqueña,in which Angel Mislan set to music Becquer's rhyme XV, Cendal Flotante."
2,Gallagher's Overboard,"I was very disappointed with this one. The beginning of it was somewhat funny and it just seemed to go downhill from there. It also seemed a little short, almost like they were rushing to get it done. Wasn't very impressed and wouldn't recommend you purchase this one. I gave it two stars."
1,On reviewing something else,"This is a rumor. I heard it from ""usually reliable sources.""Chomsky at first declined to review Verbal Behavior on the grounds that he was not competent to do so, knowing little about behaviorism. He was urged to learn and offered two tutors, both on the psychology faculty at Yale. He spent time with them, then reviewed the book.It might be that he reviewed what he had been taught by the well-respected Yale psychologists. He clearly--to those of us who studied Skinner's works--reviewed other branches that had fallen disgraced from the behavioral tree. He did not review Skinner's work, but used it as a launching pad for attacking the other forms of behaviorism. His review was more or less on the mark, except that he was aiming at the wrong target."
3,hood release,The product needed to be already encase in a houseing. The greatest difficulty was threading the cable through the existing housing without destroying the new cable. Once installed it was okay. Another solution would be if the end of the cable were welded to prevent unraveling. Tape doesn't work.
3,"Function 10, Form 1","This item is listed as a match for Chevrolet, which is true as long as you don't mind having the handle sitting on the floor of your car because none of the five handles provided ""most closely matches"" (per the package instructions). The good news is I can open my hood again. Spend the extra buck or two for the OEM version."
5,GrEaT PoP SoUnD,"My favorite song on this cd is Sunday Morning Drive... Their sound is comparable to the Beatle's pop music from the 60's mixed with a little of the more recent band, The Strokes. I had the opportunity to see Blue Cartoon Live and they put on an excellent show. This band is sexy, stylish, and undeniably cool."
2,are the other reviewers relatives?,"What a disapointment. Bad production, lame lyrics, hippy-twinged guitar. This is an opening band you skip to have a drink in the bar."
4,not the best hobo book,"but decent from a journalist sort of speculation. hes thinking about a stereotype too much. its hard to say rather he wants to be a trainhopper or a homeless guy. i know plenty of trainhoppers who dont live the way he thought was necessary. anyways, better hobo lit... you cant win, polaroid kids photography, jim tully"
5,great price for HP cartridge,"I've stopped going to store looking for HP ink cartridges. Amazon has greatprices and fast delivery, free for Prime members. I look first at Amazon if Iwant something."
2,Expired product,"I don't know if it really matters if the product has an expired date or not, but I think that the seller should disclose that it has."
4,Fine for what it is.,"The previous reviewer is incorrect. The 56 cartridge is NOT compatible with printers that use the 27. While the 27 is only 10ml, which is unfortunate, it is the only option, so you might as well buy it and move on or buy a new printer.Test Printer: HP Deskjet 3520."
2,took forever to arrive,"this took so long to arrive I forgot I ordered it. The product is great. It is ink. But if you need a replacement catridge right away, go to the store.this took so long to arrive I forgot I ordered it. The product is great. It is ink. But if you need a replacement catridge right away, go to the store."
4,HP 27 Ink Cartridge,Cartridge works fine and performs as advertised & expected. HP 27 cartridges last longer than most other cartridges will. OK product.
2,no retail package,"the ink caetridge was not in the retail packaging that would have the date on it. the cartridge was only in the foil pack, no date. does work, but for how long?"
2,"BUT HOW MUCH FOR ""SHIPPING, HANDLING & ETC.""?","Every consumer needs to become suspicious when any seller wants you to add the item to your shopping cart without knowing [a] price, and [b] ""shipping, handling, and other suchlike"". I added it, found out the price was stated to be US $ 17.88 plus shipping, THAT ADD-ON UNSTATED! What flim-flam! Direct from hp, the total cost was US $ 18.99 INCLUDING SHIPPING but without flim-flam!"
5,Ink cartridge,Used this a lot lately. So far so good. Cheaper than buying a HP catridge. Would buy this item again.
2,Wrong printer info,The little widget at the top of this page claims that this cartridge will work in a HP Deskjet F380.It does not. HP 21 is the correct one.
5,Black Ink Cartridge,"Even though one must wait for delivery of a package purchased online instead of in a big box store, the incredible pricing makes the wait worthwhile... and the product is exactly the same. Planning ahead, then buying on Amazon, is the way to go!"
3,HP 27 ink,"I have not used this item yet, and I do have some concern because it is dated November 2006. It is sealed so I hope it works properly once I need to use it."
2,DISAPOINTMENT,"I BOUGHT TWO CARTRIDGES FROMN THIS SUPPLIER, AND BOTH OF THEM CAME DEFECTIVE. THE BLACK ONE SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE AMOUNT OF INK (HP 27), THE COLOR ONE (HP 22) IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY MY PRINTER. THIS IS REALLY A DISAPOINTMENT FOR ME. I WAS EXPECTING GOOD PRODUCTS FROM THIS SUPPLIER, BEING THE COST OF NEW CARTRIDGES SO EXPENSIVE.A GOOD POINT TO THEM IS THAT THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY TO MY COMPLAINTS, AND THEY HAVE SENT ME NEW CARTRIDGES FREE OF CHARGE.I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL EVER BUY THESE PRODUCTS AGAIN, LET'S SEE HOW COME THE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES."
1,ONE DAY OF EXCITEMENT!,This tube was really fun on the first day till it popped at the seam! I did an overnight shipping to get it to take on our vacation to Montana! We had planned on playing on it for the whole week and it popped on the first day on the water! Also we had problems pulling it as it bogged down the motor heavily and we have a 150 Horsepower motor. We are returning it today and are not getting a replacement. I would hesitate if I were you when purchasing this tube. The tube itself is beautiful!
3,"Lovely shoes, but...","The sizing is always wonky with Fluevogs, so be careful when ordering. I read the reviews and based on others, picked my regular shoe size, boy was that the wrong move for me! The shoes were much too small. I would have had to go up at least a half size. They are lovely though..."
5,GREAT,"I have several pairs of Fluevogs, including 2 pairs of Malibrans. These are my FAVORITES. I find they run true to size (unlike some of my others) and are just soooo comfortable. Worth every penny, and you will get compliments all day long!"
5,Do you Fluevog?,"If you don't, you should! These shoes are beyond cute. They're a little bit retro, a little bit modern and a lot of fun. This take on the classic mary jane hit's the mark. Trendy enough to pair with new clothing styles or vintage classics yet they don't scream ""cliche hipster"". You must own them! Order 1/2 size up for a perfect fit."
3,Going downhill from the first,"While the first of this series was truly original and the plot engaging, this one doesn't have that 'je-ne-sais-quoi' that made me like the first one. It has some surprising images, but the plot seems to be just a 'draw-the-line-between-dots' from an image to the next one. I didn't like either the climax-before-the-end; the story drags on from there.All in all, it was a good read, but I expected much more from it."
5,Fables Takes Off With This Volume,"This is where the story really starts. The first volume just introduced the main characters and give a decent little murder mystery. Willingham has done so much with these characters you've known since you were a kid and crafts a great story out of them making them feel fresh and brand new.In this volume Snow White takes off up to ""The Farm"" where the non-human Fables have to live. When she gets there she finds the farm in the midst of a hostile takeover led by a fairly popular group of pigs. She finds herself backed by a suprising ally in her attempt to strike down the rebellion. The story somewhat reminded me of George Orwell's classic novel Animal Farm."
5,As good as the hype,Fantastic. I found the first book lacking but enjoyed it enough to check out this one. It FAR exceeds the first book. Having read the first four books now. Fables is definitely the best comic if you are looking for something without capes.
4,Story starts to hit its stride,"Volume #2 of Bill Willingham's ""Fable"" series compiles issues 6 thru 10 (the Animal Farm storyline) of the original Vertigo books in one handy volume. While Volume #1 was a good read, Vol #2 has a much better flow with its narrower focus - concentrating on Snow White and her adventures up on the 'farm' where she pays her annual visit to the non-human entities of Fableland living in seclusion from the eyes of humans. Overall this volume encompasses a better sense of whimsy and gives readers a better sense of the fantastical scale that this series will evolve into. If you found Volume #1 even the slightest bit enjoyable certainly give this one a try."
5,Some rough action,"I was not sure if I should buy this collection after I read first one (Legends in Exile). But then I thought that the first one is a mere introduction to the world and characters - and I bought this one.Second collection introduces even more characters and shows another location. But it also shows that this series is not about melodrama and nostalgia. It has some radical action and it looks into the ""politics"" as a system."
4,Great book!,"After enjoying Vol 1, I was definitely looking forward to more, and how this Fables world would develop. I certainly was not let down, this really is a great installment with more thought-provoking issues and more character development as we are shown the Animal Farm, a place for non-human Fables. There are problems at Animal Farm, and some serious issues are discussed. Fantastic book, incredible series."
4,Better then the first book,"I like this book better than the first one of the Fables graphic novels. I ordered the first three books of this series hoping for some guilty reading pleasure. I like the writing of this book and the art is great, but I wasn't hooked until the third book. So if you are straddling the fence on reading this series I say order the first three books and you will not be disappointed."
4,Student Quality,"This skeleton is not the best quality possible, but it does the job. If you want a basic understanding of the skeleton, I would recommend this. You can see where the casting lines are on the bones, and there are some weird nodules on the pelvis. The pisiform and triquetral are also shown as one piece. The skeleton is also more of a yellowish color than what is shown in the picture. But overall, good quality for the price."
4,Great value for the money - but not perfect,This proved to be a very nice skeleton. I had bought this for an Anatomy and Physiology class. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. When I took the skeleton to class and compared it what the university had to offer it was very close. The skeleton was not perfect. There are mold lines on the bones and some of the detail is not there. For example the skull in particular is missing many of the small detail and much of what is there is not detailed clearly. The scapula detail is also ok but not exact. For example the glenoid is not shaped well and the subscapular fossa is thick and bulky. If you are looking for a good study resource and are not too concerned about medical quality accuracy then this is a great resource
3,Decent for it's price.,I bought this to study beforehand for an intensive A+P lab class. It is not the greatest quality but most of it is fairly solid.I do have one bigger concern however:The ribs are not properly curved - the set came with all but the floating ribs in two pieces. One piece is loose but seems substantially straighter than it should be (straighter than those shown in the image I feel). The other half (the one which articulate with the sternum) comes in a flat block which has the sternum and half of every rib which joins to it.
1,WARNING: Only one tab position per color!,"I was so excited to get these folders, until I opened the box. These files have only ONE tab stop per color. Red and purple files have tabs on the right. Yellow and orange have tabs in the middle position only. Blue and green have tabs on the left. So if you were planning to use the colors to identify your files by category, you can't.Oh and a word of warning on the colors too: the purple ones aren't purple, they are a pale lavender that doesn't go with any of the other colors in the box.I'm sending these back."
1,CRUMB,IT WAS A PART AND DID WHAT IT SHOULD. HOW DO WE ADD TO THE EVALUATION. A REPLACEMENT PART SHOULD BE NO BIG DEAL IF I ORDERED AND RECEIVED THE CORRECT PART.
4,car charger,The unit was recieved on time and works good. I would recomend this OEM product to any one that could use a Magellan car 12 volt type plugin.
3,Lots of Starting and Stopping,"This was my first qigong DVD. I use it regularly, but after the first time, I started fast forwarding through all the talking. There is a lot of starting and stopping. It would have been better for me if they had created a separate section for the talking so that the movement could flow more uniformly. Since there are so few movements introduced, I thought it would also be better if more time were spent on each. I have another DVD that has a lot of movements. That one is pure sensory overload, so I don't necessarily think that more movements are needed- just more time spent on each."
4,Relaxing and easy to follow,"I felt more relaxed after I finished this DVD. It doesn't take long and the series of movements are easy to follow. For an uncoordinated person, if may keep a couple of tries to get the movements down pat. Overall, it is a very good stress relief DVD and you dont' need much room in your house to do it."
2,It was ok...,"But the guy is super annoying. I couldn't stand him. It's a little like having stuff dictated to you by a televangelist. Content is good, but I just wish that guy had stopped talking."
1,BOOORING,What a waste of money. The couple who created this DVD obviously like to listen to their own voices. You keep waiting for the exercises and finally you exercise for 2 minutes and listen to them talk for 5. Everything repeats 50 times. It's just totally boring!
4,"Clever design, lots of fun.","The simple question-and-answer format provides for plenty of interaction with your child. The clear photographs embellished with simple, cartoon-like drawings add humor and interest. When I used this book with a group of preschoolers, they were so intent on the Q & A and the small illustrations that I was able to withhold the ""gimmick""-- the large fold-out picture--until the end."
5,Beautiful illustrations to go with a beautiful story,"The moment I saw the cover I knew it would be a special book. It's story that all children can relate to... love of one's grandmother. Eloquently written and beautifully illustrated, this book is a keeper."
3,Putting Thoughts in their Point and Place in Time,"This solid sociological text reviews each of the major players in Classical Sociological thought. What's interesting is how each of the thinkers is given context in their life and times.Also, this book did a lot to undo the mis-teaching of Marx and Durkheim that I had experienced with earlier instructors. This book is worth reading for those chapters alone."
2,Well................,"Well.............It was OK, but the acting was absolutely horrible! The story was a good one, but I feel that the movie was ruined by the acting. I say that they should remake it with Tom Hanks as Mr. Covington, haha!!!"
4,Great But...,This is a great printer but it runs out of ink quickly which is costly but if you want great quality fork it out for this one
3,HP Photosmart 7550 Inkjet Printer,Worked good but was not very durable. Broke down and had to replace it with another printer.
1,Stupidest Loading Cartridge Ever!,Can't believe it will move the cartridge while cartridge clamp & cover is open. Almost broke itself!
3,I'm not quite sure yet...,"I got this for my girl friend's father for an early Father's Day gift.The set-up instructions were really easy and I was able to load and print a terrific picture from a smart media card within 10 minutes.He was very happy to use it for about a week. And then it broke.HP tech support - after several days of phone calls - said that they would send him a replacement.So - at first glance this printer seems really good, but I don't know about how well it is going to perform in the long run."
1,1 star for working for 1 month out of the past 6 years i've owned it,"1. Whenever printing Photo paper every picture comes out green, but when printing standard copy type paper it prints fine. The ONLY way to trick it is to put a peace of regular paper on top of the photo paper and ask it to print 2 copies. No - taking it off Auto paper does not work. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the driver many times and it does not help. Actually it did once fix it for one print job and that was it. I even got a whole new computer and it's still the same.Also, no matter what computer it's hooked up to the computer does not recognize that it's connected but it does print.. Strange!! I've been battling this since 2003 and i'm so tired of it. I'd get rid of it but i still have spare ink cartridges from almost never using it (i have a B&W; lazer i use all the time) so i stay with the miserable thing. Don't buy it and *definitely don't buy a used one* from anyone."
5,Great Printer!,This printer is excellent. My father died and I used the printerto print photos for an album. The pictures came out perfect. I have found this to be an excellent printer for everything.
3,Special tabbed paper required for 4x6 borderless printing,I was so disappointed after spending 3 hours trying to figure out how to print borderless on a 4x6 photo paper.It turns out that I needed special tabbed paper. See this article from HP.http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc;=us&docname;=bpy21061&product;=72891&dlc;=en⟨=en
1,4x6 Printing Problem,"I absolutely dissatisfied with this printer. Being in the tech support field, I can usually figure things out fairly quickly. I busted my head open for HOURS to print 4x6's only to find out it needs ""special"" tabbed paper to print out. Although I haven't gone out to buy this paper, I can only imagine the price since this requirement only seems to be coming from this particular HP printer. And since this printer is already discontinued I can only imagine what a hard time I will have trying to buy this paper as more time goes by.If there was an option for no stars, that is what I would give it. I like simplicity and this printer does not offer that, the print quality may be really good, but that doesn't do me any good if it only decides to print a portion of the picture and not the rest. Thank goodness I bought and extended warranty, because I will be getting a new printer."
3,Broken right out of the box!,"I will try not to judge this printer that likely has very fine print qualities too harshly, but when I got this out of the box and the first thing I get is a jammed printer cartridge error it was very disappointing. I called the HP help number and was waiting for about 15 minutes before a tech got on. It took him another 10 minutes or so to finally tell me it's broken and to take it in for a replacement where I bought it. So much for a great experience and fun Christmas present. I hope the new one works better."
4,NEW PRINTER,"I HAVE JUST PURCHASED THE HP 7550 2 MONTHS AGO. WHEN I CHECKED THE 57 CARTRIDGE, CLOSED DOWN THE TOP A LITTLE PLASTIC PEICE BROKE OFF OF THE UNDERNEATH SIDEWHERE THE SPRING IS. NOW IT WILL NOT HOLD THE CARTRIDGE SECURE AND THE PRINTER SAYS CARTRIDGE FAILED; PLEASE REPLACE. THE PRINTER WILL NOT WORK AT ALL."
1,"Looks great, but NOT for Wireless networks","I opened the printer packaging excited for an improvement over my existing HP PhotoSmart 1215. Unfortunately, I found out that the new PhotoSmart 7550 does not come with a parallel printer port. This would not normally be a problem since most all PCs these days come with a USB port, BUT if you wish to have the printer connected via a wireless printserver -- which come only with parallel port connections as far as I know -- you're out of luck. To me, having a wireless connection trumps the need for an upgrade to an already decent photo-quality printer. So, the 7550 is returned. Alas..."
2,I returned this one for Canon i850...,"This one is expensive when it comes to ink and also noisy.I will recommend to test out Canon i850 and you will know the difference...Canon i850 is way, way elegant , versatile printer and cheaper on inks,"
1,Not reliable,"I purchased the 3420 originally in March 2003. It broke in June 2003 - luckily within the 90 day warranty. HP Shipped my a refurbished 3420 and that just November 17th - outside of the 90 day warranty for the refurbished printer. There is a plastic piece that connects the printer cartridge to the belt - this is what broke in both printers. I received no compensation for the 2nd printer breaking down, and HP really had nothing to say. I do not recommend you purchasing this printer. Spend a little more money and purchase anything other than an HP!"
1,broken in 6 months...,"worked fine for a while, the usual paper jam every once in a while, but other that that it was pretty good... then all of a sudden, something inside broke, out of the 90-day warranty of course, and this thing is unusable. not recommended."
1,don't buy it,"same problem as everyone else. It'll break down shortly after you buy it, and there is only a ninety day warranty. i hardly used my printer, but after six months (and still on the first set of ink cartridges) the plastic thing broke and the ink cartridges won't move. The 3420 is inexpensive and the print quality is fine for everyday stuff, but not much point saving a few bucks when you have to keep replacing it!"
3,Decent Printer If you don't do much Printing,"I have seen the 1 star reviews and I am sure they are probably right, but if you don't print much, this is a ok budget printer. I've had no problems with it in the 6 months I've had it but then again, I print like maybe 5 pages per month. It's a good printer if you need to provide a printer to your grandma or someone who uses a printer not much."
1,My printer died too.,"My printer died last night. Searching for a solution, I found these posts describing the exact same problem with the carriage. Its very disappointing because I purchased it for the HP name. I used it minimally-- not more than 50 printed pages. I would not recommend this product."
1,Broke on me too!,"I have had this for under 1 year, and the same thing happened to me! I googled hp 3420 and found this, and now I see what happened, little plastic piece broke and, like the other lady, I can fix things, but this isn't fixable.what a rip off HP.I only bought this since I could refill the ink myself, ( many of the new ones won't let you!) but Im very dissapointed that they haven't issued a recall or offered to replace these, when obviously everyone is finding the same problem, and it is defect in thier product!"
1,Broken Gear,Mine spit a broken gear at me in the 6th month. I'm bummed because I had bought 2 cartridges that will probably sit around until they dry out.
2,hp 3420,"this is a good printer, with good print quality for letters and pictures. the flaw it has is that the little piece that holds the ink cartridges on to the drive belt breaks off. i have had two of these printers and both had the same problem."
2,"Not durable, buy at your own risk","I bought this printer about 7 months ago. I was satisfied with it's quality and speed. A bit noisy but okay. The biggest problem was the costly ink, but since I didn't really print much, this is still okay.Now the REAL problem, it spitted out some plastic parts today and stopped working anymore. The warranty period is just 90 days, and instead of paying for the repair, you can pay the same amount for another new printer.You get the idea. Buy at your own risk."
1,Junk,"Worked for about a month and then it started smearing the print at the bottom of every page. Now it only prints in blue. I've changed print cartridges and spent hours tinkering with the software to no avail.You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk!!!,"HP claims to have spent 2 Billion dollars on bringing out the new family of printers, all I can say is they didn't spend enough of it in QA. I have just spent 4+ hours trying to get this to print. Had trouble and went to help (HP instant support) What this is are overloaded tech's trying to handle up to 15 interactive chat sessions at once. This was a big waste of time and I eventually decided I need more attention. Called support (a non 800 number ) Got to talk to a tech and after 45 minutes we decided it was defective hardware (the printer) Now to get a replacement in less than 10 days means I pay expedited frieght.I think I going to return the new technology and buy one of the old series 600 printers. Not fancy but reliable.To summarize, this is Alpha product and has not had enough testing to be considered ready for everyday users. Wait 6 months and buy the next release."
2,Good book but half the examples don't compile!!,"The book seems nice at first but as you pass to chapter4 most ofhis example programs don't compile, I get errors. Also the explanations are getting confusing. You can't assimilate all thoseremarks for 1 line of code. The author surely try hard butall the pics and explanations totally confused me. I won't go to chapter 5. I purchased this book & Learning C# 2005 from Oreilly. Oreilly has less examples but at least the example are clear and they compile without any errors."
4,"May be a little too ""beginner""","This is an amazing book covering a broad spectrum of techniques involved in modern object oriented design. However, I was a little disappointed with the last section where the authors walked us through the actual implementation. The ""meat"" of the development lacked a formal use of collection classes with the intent of providing iterative lists. The did touch base on this a bit, but not the way they would have if this were a real project. I don't consider collections and dictionaries to be outside the scope of a ""beginner"" book. Also, they could have at least touched base on some intermediate topics such as the use of some basic patterns. It's very difficult to perform object modeling today without the basic use of factory patterns and singleton patterns, etc. A small section or chapter on these topics would have really put the icing on the cake with this one. Anyway, congrats guys and bravo. A terrific book!"
3,Information Overload,"First off I must say that the authors do an exemplary job at providing clear and concise explanations of object oriented programming. But, the readers who give this book 5 stars must possess an amazing ability to assimilate a huge amount of theoretical information (without applying any of it). Although I haven't gotten to the last page of the book I felt compelled to review the book at this time anyways. I have been through 600 pages of theory and pseudo code and I have yet to write a single line of C# code. Unfortunately - this is not my preferred approach to learning a programming language.For those of you who prefer a bit of theory in manageable chunks followed a bit of hands on practice then this book is not for you. I can only hope that the last ""hands on"" section which I am about to tackle turns out to be valuable. Otherwise - it back to Internet tutorials and the like."
2,Porno flick pretending to be main-stream film.,"Shot on video tape with the characteristic tacky noises of most X-rated skin flicks, a bad director trying to ""direct,"" a cast of actors trying to ""act."" I gave this apparent experiment two stars for originality: There is one brief moment when the production rises ever so slightly above the nadir of usual boredom: an honest attempt (so it seems) to communicate a bone fide romance between two young men, something rather rare in porn. Are three minutes worth the price? Hmm . . ."
1,Uses his book to attack Christianity,"While the technical content of the book is OK, the author unfortunately uses the book as a platform to attack Christianity and assert his own personal faith in human ability to make machines that will solve all the world's problems (i.e., a form of secular humanism). Some of the anti-Christian sections were over a page long.Very few of the technical books I've read have any mention of the author's personal faith. The few that do, other than this one, only make brief statements of their own faith. They have not attacked other religions."
5,Buy this Book!,"This Author tells it how it is from an NCO's viewpoint while conducting Counter Insurgency Operations- unconventional warfare during his Combat in Vietnam.The Author has a very interesting career path in which you would think for some actions, he would be finished and written off. He in fact survives to beat the odds and comes out on top. I won't spoil the book, but I was impressed at the outcome and his journey from beginning to transition. It shows that structure and rules are not always needed to accomplish results.An Unconventional Book by a Veteran that works completely outside of the box and triumphs because of it.A refreshing read that does not follow regular format structure."
3,Another memoir.,"Meh.It's a quick read and interesting, but not particularly well written. It's certainly a good story, but not peculiar among Vietnam memoirs. The book seemed written for a target audience that views ""Rambo: First Blood, Part II"" as the apex of filmmaking (don't get me wrong, it's not the worst either).I think that writing this book did less for expanding the minds of readers as healing the wounds of the author.That said, I have a great deal of respect for the author as a man and as a soldier, just not so much as a writer."
3,A good book worth reading,"This was a good book to read. It gave a new perspective from ""pre-military to post. I considered giving it 4 stars, but for an overall score, I thought 3 stars was more justified.I can recommend Gone Native to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this book, but it is not a page burner and it seemed to ramble a little towards the end. But in no way would I want a perspective purchaser of this book to think it's not a good one. It is. He is frank and honest and what landed him in the stockade was quite refreshing. (You always hear about the other guy. Well, Cornett was the other guy. Thank you for your honesty.)"
3,decent story...not very linear,"this is a pretty good war story, and i'm sure the author had ups and downs retelling it just as it happened. but the narrative seemed to jump around quite a bit and was at times hard to follow. also, the insubordination that the auther showed was quite interesting, to say the least. he seemed to want to do the right things, but oftimes did not. i hope he has learned from his mistakes and has become a member of society who can be civil with others...not always an easy thing to do after combat."
2,less than sufficient,"Cartridge that came was a refilled, non hp cartridge. I used it for one day, then my printer kept giving me an error message and wouldn't work. I still ended up having to spend $25 on a new one and this one isn't worth keeping as a backup."
1,not happy,"I was very disappointed with this product because the claim was a ""new in box ink cartridge"" and I was sent a remanufactured cartridge."
1,No Good!,"I bought one of these hp 28 cartridges in June, got around to opening it in August, and it turns out to be three years expired. The printer didn't like it. Money out the window. I thought cheap price was a deal. At the time it was $17.54"
3,It's what you expect from HP ink cartridges.,"I rate this cartridge at 3 stars because it's exactly what you should expect from a color cartridge. However, in the future I would have been more inclined to buy the XL pack because of its supposedly longer printing capability. In the meantime, I switched to an Epson printer in which you buy the three color inks (cyan, magenta, yellow) and black cartridges all separately, which makes more sense because if you tend to print with a lot of blues, you don't have to buy another tri-color cartridge from HP, you just buy the cyan that you need from Epson. That's smart money."
5,JAH_MUSIQ,"I have been a fan of James Hall and W&P since their first album, and he never cease to amaze me, although this album is primarily a collection of some of his best hits, I can only say that whoever had the job of choosing what songs to fit this album as ""best/greatest hits"" had a hard job, becasue all of his selections on each album are unique but skillful in their own way. James and Melvin Crispell make an awesome team!"
5,Thumbs up!,"Owning a home along the Juniata River,inspired me to get this wonderful book to read, which I did and I am so glad that I did it was very interesting reading,covering his trip in modern time and then flashing back to the life and times of the 1600's and 1700's people. The book made me feel as if I was back in those early years!"
