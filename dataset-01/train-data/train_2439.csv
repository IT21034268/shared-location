2,What happened to the master???,I am giving this one two stars out of respect for one of my favourite authors. I have 3001 at home but can't bring myself to read it.
2,Not as Good as 2001 or 2010,"The plot in this wasn't as memorable as the other two books, and don't like how chapters, classic as they are, are reused from Odyssey 2."
4,Great gift. We're big fans.,"I was a little surprised at what they claimed was a ""special feature"". Apparently interactive menus--standard menus for a DVD really--are special now.Still, I didn't buy it for the features. I bought it for Jack and Karen, who help keep my life fun and and drama free."
3,No tiene subtitulos,He comprado este articulo y no trae subtitulos en espa√±ol como dice la info.Una lastima!! tendrian que chequar previamente.
3,Will & Grace,I'm still a lover of W&G however the episodes are all the same. Not sure if I'll buy the rest of the DVD sets
2,Last of the good seasons,This I feel was the last really funny season of Will and Grace but I was disappointed with the outtakes..not many and not really funny.
5,w&g season 6,"I love will and grace! It's amazing! This is definitely not one of the BEST seasons, due to the fact that Debra Messing is pregnant and misses a few episodes in the end, but it is still definitely worth watching."
3,NO ENGLISH OR SPANISH SUBTITLES,"Despite the subtitles promised in the product description, you will find none, either in Spanish or English."
1,A Fraud,"I totally agree with the below-named commentor. I have all the seasons, except the latest ones that have not come out yet, and I feel that I was so cheated on season 5. Of course that does not matter because they are off the air, and opinion might not matter. They will matter if they are aired for others that are considering buy the DVD's. I say don't waste your money on five because if you are not a Karen and Jack Show fan, you will be totally lost."
1,Philips SRU 9600 Remote & Direct TV HDTV is incompatible,"I received my Philips SRU 9600 remote in late May and several weeks later I began the programming required for each piece of equipment. All went well until I tried the Direct TV H-20 satellite dish receiver. The remote allowed me to pick Direct TV from a list of 127 models, but it didn't fuction. Then it prompted me to hold down the ""OK"" button while it tried all 127 different models. It still didn't function. For several days I tried the customer service number in the manual with waits as long as 45 minutes. I finally got through today and when I explained my problem the tech immediately asked if I had a Direct TV H-10, H-20 and several other Direct TV receivers. He then explained that Philips remotes are not compatible. Of course it is 3 days past my return date so I am stuck because of deceitful ads."
3,Philips SRU9600 Universal Remote Control,"Pro'seasy to read display, User Freindly, Learns commands from a working remote. Has a hugh database of codes. I was able to use the stored codes for all my electronic devices except a CineVision DVD Player.Con'sBack light does not stay on long enough. Does not fully control a Philips DVD-HDD. Not enough buttons for some devices. Should have more function labels listed in the Jog screen. Some buttons too close to each other."
5,It can learn the basic keys of any remote.,"I really like this universal remote. The learning feature especially. Finding a universal remote that can replace your TV or DVD remote is easy. Try finding one that can replace a Roku Soubdbridge Radio remote or a Roku Netflix Player remote. The SRU9600 won't set them up automatically, but with a little time and patience it can learn all the keys of these obscure remote controls. This remote is as good as the time, patience, and imagination your willing to invest in it.If you expect the sru9600 to learn ""all"" the keys of a complex remote control automatically, your destined to be disappointed. What the remote control will do is learn the basic keys of most remote controls, and then, if necessary, you can use the ""fix a key"" feature to add additional functionality. These remotes are great value at their current internet prices."
2,Prestigo NOT so prestigious but works OK after lots of set up.,"After its programmed it works quite well. But to say it easily ""learns"" features of other remotes is an overstatement. For MANY functions, keys have to be programmed one at a time. It will beep and read out ""command learned"". But then try that newly programmed button and it likely will not work the first time you program it. I had to program EACH key 6-10 times before it truly learned from my original remotes and would function properly. There's a ""Fix A Key"" programming function that must be used repeatedly before this remote is ready to go. But, after its programmmed, it works quite well. I do like it but will keep my eyes open for something that has more hard buttons (not touch screen) that can be programmed. There is NO way to use this without looking at it while touching buttons. Only the LCD lights up but the other hard buttons are darker than tar. But, overall, it does the job. It's OK."
1,pretty darn bad,"When they play ""Thank you"" on the radio they should preface it with a warning: this is the only song worth hearing on the album. If the album wasn't a gift to me I would have asked for my money back."
1,She wrote a terrible story then tried to put music to it,LABEL ON CD SHOULD SAY WARNING : THIS CD IS A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY PUT IT DOWN NOW. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS CD WHY NOT RATHER GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THE HOMELESS OR SOMETHING CAUSE THAT IS WHAT ALANIS IS GOING TO BE AFTER THIS ALBUM.
1,Alanis Morissette missed the mark.,"As a major music buyer, I've noticed a few things tend to happen when a artist releases a follow-up CD to a spectacular, mind-blowing one. They either release one too soon and the CD sounds exactly like the first. Or they take too long and lose their edge and/ or their lyrical-musical fluidity. Unfortunately, Alanis waited too long. She still has her cutting edge, but with the exception of ""Thank U,"" ""The Couch,"" and ""So Pure,"" the music and lyrics seem to lack any cohesion. Sometimes it's as if she simply took a transcript of sessions with her shrink and layered them over music and didn't bother to make the two match. I was really disappointed. I really don't think this CD will fly."
1,This is the worst album ever made!!! Do not waste your money,"I hate this album!!!!! Alanis, get a life, and write some music that at least has a good tune! Please, people...no matter how much you liked her first album (I loved it!)--DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this CD. I would not pay a dollar for it!"
1,You Can't Do That On CD,"terrible. does anybody realize that Jagged Little Pill was NOT her debut. She used to be a Debbie Gibson sound alike, until she figured out she could hit it big by sounding tormented ex. ""Oh my god, I relate Sooo much to Alannis. She feels tortured just like me!"" Pathetic. If you have a brain, you will stop supporting artists like this"
1,Horrible!,"This CD doesn't even get 1 star. Maybe a fourth of a star for ""Thank U"" but that's about it. I was a huge fan of Jagged Little Pill, but this album seems like a waste of my money. Some people say change is good, but Alanis changed a bit too much for the worse. She went from strongly worded songs with great beats to soft, off-beat tunes. I must say I am highly disappointed."
1,"go back to your roots, alanis.","i think alanis should stop with this nonsense and go back to doing what she originaly was, a pop singer."
1,"Wow, these low reviews from Alanis fans are hilarious...","They say that Alanis used to be great and this album sucks as a follow-up. HELLO? People, Alanis sucked then and she sucks now, for lack of more subtle expressions for her condition. I find it appropriate that Madonna, the woman who has nearly single-handedly destroyed pop music forever, signed this harpy. Her total lack of any musical or lyrical talent is so obvious to me, I just don't understand how 20 million people got duped. Not all of them could have been 12-year old girls...or could they? The dumbing down of America continues unabated as this stuff passes for substantial music full of 'personal expression'...."
1,TERRIBLE GARBAGE.ONE HIT WONDER GIRL,"After selling 16 million copies of her debut album,this follow-up BOMBED big-time! The only single to make the charts,""thank u"",peaked at a paltry #17,and alternative radio dropped this mess faster than you can say, Vanilla Ice. Proof,that her debut album's success,was INDEED,a fluke! Most recently,Alanis relased an MTV unplugged special,and cd..The special aired on MTV to poor ratings,and the companion cd bombed,peaking at at #60... I haven't seen a rock artist go from hot to cold this fast,since Peter Frampton!"
2,"Poor,lacking ideas,repetitive...","Since she was angry and depressed on 'Jagged Little Pill',what's next?We are dealing here with a mellower version of the first album,rehashing similar themes,like the self-fulfilling prophesy of failure.A totally forgettable venture."
2,Second Alanis cd falls short,"So many people loved this album, but I just don't see it. The music is dull and sparse, containing no memorable hooks, and the lyrics just ramble on and on, with no real rhyme. How could this same woman have written Jagged Little Pill only...oh, yeah, and why did she wait so long to release a follow-up? By this point, the world just did not care anymore. And what's with the cover art?The only songs I like are ""Unsent"" and ""One,"" but even those don't affect me like any of the tracks on Jagged Little Pill. I kind of wish she'd left out some of these songs and put in ""Uninvited"" and ""No Pressure Over Cappuccino."" But oh well...hopefully, some of these tunes will come into their own when Alanis performs them in concert. She's awesome to see live, go check her out if you get the chance!"
2,Sophmore Follow-Up Falls Short,If you loved Jagged Little Pill you won't like this one. Hard-edged tracks mixed with softer ballads are not what I expected. Where are the fun-loving pop sounds Alanis is famous for? Not reccomended.
2,SFIJ almost unlistenable,"Taking poetic license to an extreme, ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" is almost painful to listen to straight through. Most of the album is blank verse, with syllables in words and words in sentences mis-emphasized in order to preserve the meter. When it happens once, that's a songwriter admitting that there's no way to make a statement euphonic. Since Ms. Morissette does it over and over, she is either experimenting or didn't take the time to polish. I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I imagine I'll be tossing ""Jagged Little Pill"" in the CD player any time I want to hear her voice..."
1,But is it Good?,Alanis fans and fans of music played ad nauseum on commercial radio will like this. Those who like a variety of good music will not.
4,I think Alanis Morissette's new CD shows growth by her.,I listened to a few samples and I liked what I heard. I think her growth is evident- by the way her songs flow-I really like the single-One.
1,"Self-indulgent, pseudo-spiritual crap","This was a huge waste of money. Obviously she did have one good album in her and like so many others substituted poorly arranged and executed ramblings for a follow-up. Well, the second album usually predicts staying power. I work at a record store and these stopped moving fast after day one and already CDs are coming in for the used bin on this one."
1,this cd really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i feel that alanis could of done a whole lot better on this cd and i feel that it sucked.
4,Gets better with more listenings,"I wasn't thrilled with this CD this first time I heard it. But since I'm seeing Alanis is concert next week, I listened to the CD a few more times. And it has definitely started to grow on me. I think the middle songs start to sound the same and there is nothing that really hooked me. But I enjoy at least half of the songs as much as anything on ""Jagged Little Pill""."
2,Not that good...,"I liked JLP, but this album is SOOOOO boring!!!! Except for ""Joining You"" and a couple of others, this album put me to sleep!!! I don't even like the new single ""Unsent"". It looks like Alanis will imitate Hootie's chart record...."
3,Former Fanatic now Only Supposed Fan,"I must say the first time that I heard the first 4 tracks of Jagged Little Pill, I absolutely thought, this is going to be SO BIG! Let me make this review short and sweet and say that I love Alanis. Her concerts are wonderful, and there will never be another Jagged Little Pill. However, with SFIJ, there are some really good tracks on here that are suitable for a mix tape, but to listen to this entire album at one time really starts to itch at my skin."
1,"A disappointing second effort, lacks the honesty and style","A disappointing second effort, lacks the honesty and style of Jagged Little Pill."
3,Supposed Burnt Out Junkie,Took the wife and two teenage daughters to see Alanis at the Warfield Theater in San Francisco on the 12th of this month.Two encores and a great show.I think she fell kinda deep into that George Harrison Bangladesh thing on this cd.Suprised she did'nt start playing a sitar.
3,nice music overall but she wasn't embraced,"Thank you was a good choice for a first single and the strongest on this album with a very long title, but it wasn't embraced very well by music fans. I remember late night shows taking stabs at the music video for it. But really this album is more musically diverse than Pill and is worth checking out."
5,no 'junkie' here...,"I bought this cd after i bought the unplugged cd and i was greatly surprised. I really like the hard rockin in such songs as I was hoping and joining you. (especially joining you!) some better songs of the album are, so pure, thank u, that i would be good, ur, and would not come. I hope you purchase this! I have yet to regreted it!!"
4,"A Spiritual, Humble Alanis","Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie definitely tells us that a lot has happened to Alanis in three years, personally and musically. She has droped her angry feminist vibe and has focused on her inner self. ""Thank You"" is a humble tribute to India, ""Baba"" deals with religion, ""Heart of The House"" is dedicated to her mother, and ""Unsent"" has very personal messages to her ex-boyfriends. She definitely is into dance and techno influence, as we can hear on ""So Pure,"" and ""Front Row."" This CD is not as elecrtifying as Jagged Little Pill, but definitely more mellow. It's good to listen to if you want to unwind."
3,Much too personal,"While writing about personal material is by no means wrong, Alanis Morissette indulges herself too much in her songwriting. Constantly in repetition, the songs on this album lack the craftsmanship; the songs seem thrown together. Alanis has a nice and unique voice, but she needs vocal lessons. Alanis -- write about more than wondering if someone is mad at you wearing pants."
5,"Mature, insightful, and still In Your Face.","I found this album to be easier to listen to than JLP. In JLP, I thought that Alanis did too much screaming and bitching. I always said that she needed to grow up and stop complaining. And she did. This album shows it. She did some major soul searching and found something in her heart to write about. I think that this CD is a must for those who wanted more out of Alanis. If you still want to live in the past and scream your guts out, then by all means stick with JLP. If not, then I suggest getting this CD. You won't be dissapointed."
3,It's alright...,"This album is alright, I guess. Nothing hasn't really improved here; she still has the voice and the same style of songwriting. The only thing prevented me from giving this album a 1 star is it's dramatic difference from ""Jagged Little Pill"" (which I also rated 3 stars). This album is somewhat POP rather than ALTERNATIVE. If you like Alanis, and you only have the first album, you have to buy this one; it's WAY different."
2,Disappointing,"This album is about lyrics not music. There are some rather embarrasingly mediocre songs like ""I Was Hoping"" and ""One"" which make me cringe. I bought this two months after its release and it's now collecting dust. Sorry Alanis, I've joined the Tori Amos crowd--she deserves more respect than you."
5,An Amazing album still 18 Months Later,"I first bought this C.D the day it came out on November 3, 1998, and had since then played it so much, many of the songs skipped. I decided to rebuy it last weekend, and I was blown away. It was almost like listening to it again for the first time. While it wasnt as successful as Jagged Little Pill, I think on a personal level, it was a smash! Alanis sings truths that we can all relate to, and thats why this album is beautiful! Her voice is so much more powerful than it was on Jagged Little Pill (no doubt due to her touring!) and every song on this cd has something to offer! When listened to from start to finish, it is simply amazing!"
2,How about something different Alanis? Same old same old...,"Maybe the songs are different, but the vocal inflection & whining is still there. She slurs her words so bad it's painful & she insists on sticking w/ mechanical instruments for that hollow sound that worked so well in Jagged Little Pill. As far as I'm concerned, she may have grown up a little, but she has yet to blossom in creativity - she's under the old ""if it worked once, don't try anything different"" thinking. PLEASE GET RID OF THE SCREECHING & WHINING & start showing us what else you can do w/that gorgeous voice you've got, Alanis! Pay attention to your label owner's career - Madonna's grown w/ every album she's made since 1983 by taking chances & doing new things, be it vocally or instrumentally - you might want to try the same thing. I admire Alanis's GREAT talent & obvious gifts, but this album is too commercial to distinguish it from anything else out there."
2,Unoriginality at its best,"Alanis must of run out of Ideas for songs on this roast beef hash of an album. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it has 5 good songs (out of 17 songs). This album is 71 minutes of Jagged Little Pill rehash. The lack of ""uninvited"" on this album only helps to make this album worse. Alanis is a highly overrated musician. Anybody can release one good album and one good single."
4,#!%$&*#@!!!!!B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T,@!#$%^&#@!$%*&^%!!!!! BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!! THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT. FIRST OFF I AM NOT A FAN OF JLP IN FACT I TRADED IT IN THE SAME DAY THAT I BOUGHT IT. THIS ALBUM HOWEVER IS THE WORK OF A MATURE SKILLED ARTIST WHO HAS FINALLY COME INTO HER OWN!!!!! DEFINATELY ONE THAT I WON'T BE TRADING IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Fantastic and Worth Every Penny!! 5 stars and more!!!!,Alanis new album rocks! Im a huge Alanis fan and hope that this album with win some more fans! Alanis rocks! Everyone go out and buy this cd! You will not regret it! The new album is edgier and will rock on like Jagged Little Pill has!! All i can say is buy the album now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,More of the same,"Against the will of my roommate, I bought the CD. Jagged Little Pill contained music that I detested at first, then grew on me so much that I loved the album. It was original, insightful, and a little out of control. I was hoping to find something as original as the first with this CD, but was sorely disappointed. Drum tracks that we heard before; simgle line, minor piano lead-ins to tunes (aka City of Angels); even steeping as low as titling music ""Thank U"" and ""U R""... I mean, what a sad attempt at being alternative. Maybe I'll be disappointed and after a year I'll love this album, but I'd suggest waiting until then to purchase it."
2,The Melodies are slow and boring as are the words,"Disappointing, she has gone from a sexy angry white woman, to a pop act. ( Yawn )"
1,Bad follow-up,"Geez, after JLP Alanis seemed to slack or something. There are 1 or 2 good songs, but the rest seemed so... ugly. I think she'll make a better album once she is out of the spot-light. I must say, Alanis won't survive long at his rate ..."
2,The fire is gone,"Much of the emotionally charged fire from her previous cd is gone in this new release. While I play Jagged little pill repeatedly, I doubt I will listen to this more than once."
5,It's original; she has something to tell us...,"Jagged Little Pill is a very good album, but Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is...phenomenal!!!The maturity of Indian sounds, the deepness of her lyrics... The more I listen to it, the more I fall in love...She is original, her style is unique... In French we'd say: ""C'est √©coeurant!!"" (wow!!!)She has improved a lot and doesn't try to be commercial..."
5,extreemly deep and emotionally awsome!!,this is a really neto CD!! A hint for lsteners: listen to the whole CD about twice before you make a judgement. after that the songs will really stick on you.alanis has a talint of making her voice sound diffrent when she wants to. all of her songs are really indavidual and unique! i love it!!!!:) go alanis!
4,Beautiful and creative,"It's very real to my own life so I can relate to it more then other songs. It makes you look back and say to yourself, ""Hey, if that wouldn't have happend then I would of never have met you or done this..."" And everything really does happen for a reason."
3,Too much angst ridden noise. And I LOVE Alanis!,"From one who was addicted to ""Jagged Little Pill"" I feel shamed having to let you in on the fact that this album is 80% noise and stress. It's got a different flavor than the venom on album #1. I think Alanis stepped over the edge. Of course I like the new singles, but they are hidding the real truth of the rest of the album."
5,"Awesome CD...If you like ""Jagged"" You will Love ""Junky""",I am a new Alanis Fan and loved her last album...This one did not grab me right away but boy has it knocked me out!!! I have owned it for 4 weeks and simply cant stop playing it!! She inspires deep thinking and self reflection.....I feel good any time I listen. You nay sayers obviously hav'nt given it a chance..Because if you did you would follow suite with Five Fricking Stars!!!
4,Painful at first. . .but increasingly catchy.,"I have to agree with many of the people who have commented on this site. The first 1. . .2 or even 3 listens to the album are difficult. HOWEVER. . .the more you listen, the more that stands out. Bottom line - if you like Alanis' music this album is worth listening to until it finally ""catches."" Once it does, you will find that the music is just as satisfying and the words just as intriguing and honest. Patience for this one. . ."
1,What's wrong wither her voice?,Alanis Morissette's voice is really annoying. She can't really sing and her songs are dumb and pointless.
5,such an expression,"i don't understand how this cd is not still doing well on the charts. even though it has already sold around 10 million worldwide, it should still be in the top 10. this cd is absolutely awesome and deserves to be listened to. alanis describes aspects in my life better than anyone (even myself) could. if i am depressed, i listen to ""that i would be good"". if i am in a hyper mood, i listen to ""so pure"". every song opens a remarkable door in my life. thank you alanis."
1,Only Judging by what i've heard on the radio....,"ICK! what happened to Alanis' lyrics that people could actually understand. Now, i'm not the most psychological gal in the universe, but i can generally figure out what song lyrics mean. With Alanis, I sit there in a daze just wondering what the heck she's trying to say now! Just say it, like the good ol' alanis days. I can figure out what ""rain on your wedding day"" must be like."
3,"nOT gREAT FOR aLANIS, BUT STILL BETTER than anyone ELSe","I liked Jagged a lot more, because it seemed like what rock was about, but this was really self involved stuff, which would be okay I guess if Alanis had really interesting thoughts, but she is no Confucious. I keep coming back for the voice though, even when the lyrics aren't great, her voice is the greatest."
4,Exceptional display of musical talent.,"Got real hyped about the CD after getting very tired of hearing Jagged Pill. Really like hearing Thank U the first couple of times and it just keeps getting better. Hope it doesn't get old like Ironic did, just one request, please don't over play it like Jagged Pill got overplayed. Great beginning to CD, front row rocks, BABA rocks, slows it down a bit for the next 2 (question, who thinks that ""are you still mad"" is a conclusion to ""uninvited"", kinda like what metallica did for unforgiven?) great song. Then we get into almost a Madonna funk for 5 or 6 songs. Kinda like the word-rap-around she uses, very unique. overall i'll probably get used to every song, like with jagged pill."
3,Listen to this CD before buying it...,"I really did not know what to expect of this album. After hearing ""Thank U"" on the radio, I was expecting to hear ""Alannis Anthems"" that were more mature and womanly. I just bought this CD last night at midnight (had to get it!) and played it once. I was already in a bad mood, and the music in this CD only amplified it. There are messages she is trying to convey, but I just did not get them the first time around. Perhaps it was all that instrumentation and percussion that her voice tends to get lost in... There are a few familiar sounding tracks that remind me of the Alannis I met in ""Jagged Little Pill"". I think that this CD will do very well on the charts, but I will have to warm up to it and perhaps get a little guidence through it by way of the media."
3,Jaded Little Listener,"I work for a label and I'm a singer and I have found myself stuck about pop music for awhile... love/hate... but I saw the ""Thank You"" video and cried because I thought it was so beautiful. I guess I'll get this CD."
4,Not too shabby,"I don't care what these people say about Alanis not being deep or insightful or whatever. I think she sounds great. Jagged Little Pill was not my favorite cd of all time, but I enjoyed listening to it. I believe her new cd is the same. Sometimes I like music because it sounds good. If you don't like the sound of her voice, don't listen to her music. It doesn't have to be deep to be good. Just ask a Hanson fan! They have millions of fans, and their music is a FAR CRY from deep or insightful!"
1,bad music,"She is still Alanys Morrisette. Her voice is STILL scratchy, and her songs STILL don't have good melodies"
5,Awesome,I liked Thank You the best followed by Front Row then That I Would Be Good. Overall I like the album. It was not like the first one and was good all on it's own merits. I think it will be a commercial success after airplay and word of mouth.
2,THE GOOD SONGS ALL SOUND THE SAME,"The best songs on this CD sound the same: piano intro, bass line, and a good feel. But they don't carry the CD. The lyrics are interesting, the music skillful, but there is a sense the CD was rushed. Perhaps a dissappointment to Alanis' stalwhart fans, it is a fair CD to those indifferent to her."
4,That she would be good,"This new recording, even though its not as excellent as other of the year's new releases from other artists, still proves that Alanis is a gifted musician and lyricist."
1,Not a good album !,"On the back of the excellent Jagged Little Pill album, I was expecting a lot from Alanis. I didn't get it.We all know the ""hidden"" lyrics in the first (third) album, and Alanis always seems like she has a few axes to grind. JLP is an album I play when I'm feeling melancholy. It gives me a good release. It also has some every good songs on there.The new album seems to have propelled Alanis from a few pints of beer at lunch to a full bottle of vodka on the back of losing your job. It's depressing stuff. It does have a few saving graces, e.g. ""thank u"", a great song, but what IS she trying to say ?All in all, she's in danger of losing her public who like her ""attitude"" but without the dose of the Samaritans."
5,"It takes time but you'll love it..""Joining You"" is beautiful","This album does take time to appriciate, but believe me, it's well worth it! It is different from Jagged Little Pill in many ways, but it is just as good. The one song that stands out the most in my mind is most definately ""Joining You"". This song is charged with emotion and can bring you to tears if you just let it. Overall, the album is great, and Alanis is amazing!"
2,deeply disappointed,"Jagged Little Pill, I now mention it along the same lines of Slippery When Wet, Back in Black, 1984, Nevermind, and Whitney Houston - landmark albums. Then her sophmore album came out. I almost took her off the afore mentioned list. Where is he growth in this alnum? All I hear in these songs are boring rehashed melodies and the same (once refreshing) use of mindless catch phrases that simply annoy you. She has so much to say that at times I feel she's trying too hard to git her emotions and belies into a dsong. The result is mixture of confusion and perplexity. Perhaps that is what she is aiming for. Only time will tell."
4,Alanis is still growing,I think I know where Alanis was going with this but it kind of doesn't go anywhere. Not that that is a bad thing...it's just grating on the nerves to listen too. There are a few great songs on here but there a lot of really bad ones too. Morissette is a brilliant lyricist. I think the next CD is gonna be her best. She's sharp and open minded. She's just going through an awkward growth spurt as an artist. And I think this album reflects that awkwardness well.
3,Alanis has a big mouth,"Alanis Morissette returned in '98 with SUPOSSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. As a follow up to JAGGED LITTLE PILL it's good but flawed. First, the album way too long and only a handful of the tracks are actually good. Alanis over writes her lyrics all over this album. She talks and sings with way too much detail. It's as if she came loaded with information just for this album. The sound on SFIJ is a bit calmer than her previous but it still deals with some pretty heavy subject matter. It's pop/rock with some acostic influences. Most of the tracks don't even have hooks that you can remember. Certain songs like ""thank u"", ""ur"", ""so pure"" and a couple others have pop sencabilieies and hooks. As I said before, only a handful of songs stick out on SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. Let's see if Alanis leaves a little to the imagination on the next album."
2,"A mild, less-angry, and less melodic effort from Alanis","In fairness, a more versatile set than Jagged Little Pill, but lacks the real punch of the debut. There's a lot of music on this disc, 17 tracks, making it worth the price of admission. Still I would have hoped more of the tracks would have impressed me initially, only 3 did, and 1 of the 3 has already been on radio for the last month. Also disappointing is the absence of the ""Uninvited"" track from ""City of Angels"".Still it may be the type of collection that grows on you, but initially I personally expected more..."
2,"Not as bad as her critics say, not as good as her fans say.","Perhaps back in the beginning days of rock and roll a group, duo or solo artist could rely solely on one gimmick or a single bend in style... however, today, Alanis relies too heavily on her barfing, stacatto interruptions to her songs... she does this on ""Thank U"" to excess (along with almost all of her songs)as she did on her first non-Tiffany-like album. I must admit that both Jagged Little Pill and this offering elude to possible greatness in the future but alas, no greatness here. Without Ballard, Alanis remains yet another tiresome poser. I'd like to see her do some classic rock and roll rebellion songs in an unplugged fashion (just to see what happens, and without that stacatto barfing crap, I bet it would be real cool)."
3,Album is good...but lacking,"When I heard ""Thank You"" I couldn't wait to get the album and therefore I rushed to get the album this morning before I went to work. Well, I just finished it and I like it, but something's missing. Alanis' style is a bit whiney, but this album goes a little too far. ""Thank You"" is definitely the best song on the album...I love her haunting melodies, but there just weren't enough other songs that maintained that level of emotion. I would recommend buying the album, but don't expect quite so much."
1,Awful,Alanis is an extremely untalented artist who does not deserve any of the respect she gets. This CD was even more dreadful than her last. I think she was actually better when she was a little known Canadian pop icon in the early 90's and that doesn't say much. All you fans need to grow up!
1,What a mess!,"Outside of ""Thank you"" the lyrics to this album sound like they were written AND sang as the music played in the background. What happened?"
1,"supposed former ""singer"" - junky","alanis is stinky. she screeches like cat claws running down a chalkboard. and although she doesn't screech as much, the pretentiousness and poor overall song quality don't earn her any points this time around, either. lots of females kick her booty musically every day. former alanis junkies, i invite you to discover fiona apple, jewel, sarah mclachlan, joni mitchell, ani difranco, paula cole, lauryn hill, courtney love, carole king, erykah badu, or luscious jackson, for starters. don't believe the hype."
1,Disappointing,"The only song worth listening to is ""Thank U."" The rest is a whining, grating complaint about everything. I was hoping for more."
1,What the Hell was I thinking when I bought this!,I should have checked the reviews here on Amazon first before buying Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. What a load of self centered self righteous crap. The music is horrible and her voice is painful to listen to for much of the album. A dying animal screeches better than this. What happened Alanis??? I loved Jagged Little Pill.Every song on this album is I this and I that. They all sound the same musically and lyrically.Well Thank U for stealing my money. I can't return the cd because I opened and played it(once). I'm going to have to find another use for it.....maybe a coaster.Alanis...wake up and smell the coffee...this cd sucked. You will not be getting anymore of my money until you put out a quality piece of work.
2,So-so,"JAGGED LITTLE PILL sold roughly 13 million copies. This sold roughly 2 million. That tells you all you need to know, really...."
2,Where's the rock?,"Alanis Morrissette had a great US debut with Jagged Little Pill, an album with a great variety of songs. Sadly, she joins the likes of Bush and Live as another artist who went away from a winning formula on a monster album. Like Live and Bush, Alanis gets all weepy and mellow on us while trying to sound very wise in the ways of the world. The new formula doesn't work. The only good songs are Joining You and So Pure, songs with a good driving beat. The rest are a bunch of meaningless, wispy, mushy, quasi-intelligent gook that Alanis picked up while 'discovering herself?' in the depths of India."
1,Alanis lost her spunk,"I loved Jagged Little Pill because it left me feeling charged - the music was energetic and powerful, and it left a listener feeling on top of the world. I could only get myself to listen to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie all the way through once because it had much more of a ""why me, woe is me"" feel to it that left me wondering, ""wow, what happened to her?"" I bought this album a month after it came out; I haven't listened to it since. It is an artistic album, but not what I would have expected from the person who created Jagged Little Pill."
1,Slowly and calmly drop the CD,"I was a huge fan of Alanis, listening to Jagged Little Pill religiously. I was both happy and excited to have secured a copy of this CD when it came out and a hurried home to play it.I was hugely dissapointed.When I listened to this CD I was reminded of a chorus of yowling cats with a finale of barking dogs. Apart from 'Thank U' this has to be one of the biggest piles of crap I've ever listened to, and if you are even THINKING of buying it I suggest you get therapy because you obviously have a serious problem. At least I had the excuse of never hearing any of the tracks on this CD when I bought it, as I still was in the happy place of imagining that this would be as good as 'Jagged Little Pill'.Ignorance is bliss."
1,nothing special,she lost the edge from the first album.there's nothing on this disc that matches you outta know.and for my money i still would take anni defranco over here.because anni did this style way before alanis even thought of it.in fact alanis was closer in style to paula abdul? with another album like this one she will be in the used bend next to paula.
1,BAD,"Alanis Morrisette, aside from being ugly, wierd, and naked, can't sing for pork chops. Yes, I said this before. She's just strange folks, and I don't really see the appeal of her music or her in general. It's just bad folks, Well, I'm done. Nobody I know likes her either and her songs last forever and I hate her videos. All except for ""You Learn"" that was at least halfway normal. Bye. I don't care if you disagree."
1,I didn't like this cd at all!!!,"I bought this cd because of the song ""Thank You"" and that was the only good song on it...I hated...I've listened to it once..and that was enough....it was a waste of money!"
1,"Bad, but that's what I expected",I hate this C.D. Alanis Morissette has not made a good song ever. I think this C.D. should get no stars.
1,What a disappointment,"Add me to the list of people who LOVE Alanis's JLP (still) but HATE this collection of irritating ""songs."" Okay, OKAY! We know you can be philosophical, already. I can read my diaries for this type of thing. How about some entertainment?"
3,"Good, but still diasappointing","This album was OK, but did not live up to ""Jagged Little Pill"". There only about five songs on this album that I actually enjoyed. Considering the fact that there is 17 tracks, that isn't very good. A lot of her songs seemed liked she was just talking loudly and with rythm. But the 5 songs I did like were excellent. I think she just had to much pressure to put out another milestone."
1,""" SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! ""","I don't even call this music.. I have no idea what Alanis is trying to do,,, but if it's sing???? She need some serious help with it. I have never heard or seen such a OVER RATED wanna-be singer in my life. Thank U India??? She really needs to check India out a little better. All the poverty, suffering and death due to starvation in that country. I can think of better places to thank. Standing in the middle of the street naked singing babbled words that sound as though a 6 year old wrote....just isn't my idea of misic.. Her first album did have 1 song on it that I liked but I don't buy cd's for just 1 song. Oh! Take some harmonica lessons Alanis."
5,This album kicks some serious butt!!,"This album is just as good as ""Pill"" was!! Her Indian sound totally rox!! This is a really great album!!!"
4,"Four and 1/2 stars, actually","So, AM just returned from a spiritual sojourn to 'Mother India' (what, she couldn't find a ghetto in the USA? She needed to go to India to realize that it's ok to have chunky thighs?) and she's metamorphed from AWC (angry white chick) to BIBSHWC (bitter, introspective, but somewhat hopeful, white chick) leaving only Fiona Apple and a few others to work the AWC angle. The music on this ambitious 17-song CD (when you get 17 songs on a CD, you realize that 99% of the other 'artists' out there are ripping us off) is amazingly good...good enough for me to finally take the goddess Sarah McLachlan off my CD player for now. Quirky arrangements, world-beat rhythms abound on this CD. My only complaint---a little too much staccato singing style and not enough gorgeous singing as in the song 'One'. This is a 'must buy' CD."
2,"boring, uncreative, mediocre at best - a huge disappointment","How is it possible that Alanis could, after such success with J.L.P., cough up such crap? I'm all for artistic impressionistic interpretation, but it seems as though she was really trying to outdo herself, and in the process forgot the most task before her, which is to entertain us. It wasn't broke, so why did she try to fix it. Enjoy ""Thank U"" while it's played on the radio, and leave it at that. Spend your money on the new Jewel album instead!!"
1,boring,"I think ""psycho bong babble"" sume this up the best. I loved Jagged Little Pill...it's still a must have on any drive over 20 minutes. I think I'll donate the new one to charity. Except for Thank U, I didn't even make it thru an entire song. My big question is...just how much pain, suffering, rediscovery and enlightenment could a 20-something posiibly have experienced?Bottom line: don't waste your money...keep listening to Jagged Little Pill."
5,the only record you need!!!,"alanis album is a great mix of rock and pop. for me, it's the perfect album and it get's better everytime I listen to it. the best tracks are baba that I would be good joining you and sympathetic caracther."
5,Another hit album by the Queen of Pop,"I loved this CD!!! After buying JLP, I just had to get this one too, and the more I listen to it, the more I love it! So pure, thank u, and sympathetic character are my fav songs on there. I definitely recommend this one to all!!"
1,Disappointing!,"I have eagerly awaited this album and am severly disappointed from it. Yes, it is witty, intellectual and thought-provoking. But no, it has none of Alanis' former playfulness, none of the melodic extraordinaries. It turned out too dark and too nineties. ""Thank You"" is probably the best track already. Sorry, but this is a waste of money..."
5,SFIJ is of extremely high quality,"Alanis Morissette has proved with her second major release that she can do what not many other singers are able to do,....the uniqueness of her music proves that fact that she deserves to be on the top of the charts everyhere... The day I got the album I found myself listening to it for almost 7 hours. I am sure that you shall do the same..its a great buy as all the song are really good. my personal favourites are So Pure and thank you."
5,Alanis scores again with a smorgasboard of musical delights,"Alanis is back with a very incredible sophomore album, featuring a far more diverse range of audio luxury than Jagged Little Pill. Be it the folk ballad 'Unsent', the infectious, dancable 'So Pure', the grinding, Indian rock of 'Baba' or the 80s keyboard pop of 'Front Row', every song on this album has a different style. Alanis wilds out with her voice and lyrics in experimental and unexpected ways, and toys with new sounds and instruments that are sure to please the listener. A++ for Alanis. Go buy it!"
3,Good but not as good as her first.,I am a big fan of Alanis and I love her music. But I have to say that this album is not as good as her first. When people think of Alanis they think of her as a hard core female artist. This album is way too mellow. Keep it up Alanis!
5,Excellent!! Very creative and insightful lyrics and music,"this is a great CD. Alanis seems to have mellowed a little with age. She seems to be losing that ""angry young woman"" image she had on JLP. But I really enjoy this CD and recommend it to all!"
3,what happend??????,"I have her firts cd and love it, in fact I'm listning to it right now. when i was hearing the others from her 2nd cd i was so disapointed. What happend???????"
1,What a disappointing follow-up to Jagged Little Pill.,Alanis' best song to date (Uninvited) isn't even on this album
4,The album is haunting with several highs and lows.,"The album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is amazing. There are haunting melodies that shape the feeling for the songs. It is much more artisic in its value than Jagged Little Pill. However, near the conclusion of the cd, it slacks off to a less dramatic feel to a storybook, dreamy feel. All in all, the album is great for a serious, dark, audience yet it ends with a forward looking happy conclusion."
5,A great additon to the music industry!,"Alanis was able to improve and grow with this second CD. Not only does she sing with the same depth of emotion, but her music has evolved into something that reflects the woman she is today. And the song ""I Was Hoping,"" could not be a more beautiful ballard."
5,Alanis's best cd,"I think this is one of her best cd's! If your not as familiar with her work, this shoul dbe the first cd you buy! ALL the songs are awesome and i cant stop listening to the cd over and over and over.... (you get the point) Dont worry, this is well worth your money!"
2,Yuck!,"I liked Jagged Little Pill, which this album is totally oppisite of. This one is so much slower. I wouldn't of bought it if I knew what it sounded like. The only good song, in my opinion, is ""Thank U"". Just buy the single and save some money!"
1,I wasted my money!!,"I was so pumped when Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie came out. I loved Jagged Little Pill and will probably wear it out(if it's possible). I have listened to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie only once. It is terrible. If I could take it back I would, but I can't. So what can I do....I know, anyone up for some Frisbee!?!"
3,Supposed Angry White Female,"After the huge sucess of Jagged Little Pill, Alanis needed to find a new persona. She needed to evolve. Well after trips to India and Cuba, she popped out this. Supposed Former Infatution Junkie is a porrait of a confused yet less bitter Alanis. Her lyrics are intelligent and funny as always and musically, she's never sounded better. There's something slightly annoying though. Some songs are beautifully written and sound beautiful but Alanis gets ahead of herself. On some songs, her intelligent lyrics turn into ramblings and her music gets too heavy and waves over her lyrics and scrambles them. SFIJ isn't a necessarily happy Alanis. She's still struggling to find her ground but she definetely is on her way. Goodbye anger and bitterness.Standout Tracks- ''Thank U'' ''Unsent'' ''That I Would Be Good''"
4,patience...it's worth it,"o.k, so the first time you heard the album, it sounded like a big mess, it may have happened the 2nd time too, but if you'd give it a chance it'll grow on you and you'll love it almost as much as i know you loved JLP. my favourites- FRONT ROW, ONE, THE COUCH (CHILLING), UNSENT, WOULD NOT COME (thanku is too obvious a choice...)"
2,"A far cry from her last albumn, and somewhat of a letdown...","alanis has changed her whole appeal on her sophmore albumn, and it isn't what i expected from a woman that brought us such angst ridden lyrics and songs on her last albumn. i'll stick to my ""jagged little pill"", and use this new albumn more as a coaster than a cd...i thought that since she spent so much time preparing ""supposed former infatuation junkie"" that it would be just as awesome as her first...boy, was i wrong!"
3,Second CD did not meet my expectations,I was very dissapointed with the new cd. All the songs are slow and boring. I like the more up beat ones that were on her first cd. If you didn't like the first cd. Don't bother buying the second one.
3,A complete disappointment!,"Not what I expected as a follow-up album. To dark, no flow and no direction. The only song worth listening to is the one getting air time. Does that tell you something Alanis. How about a solid album with some type of rythem."
5,zoned out on this one...,"I see this as Alanis' meditation album, the one where she discovered God and even got over herself a bit... Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of her very best albums, the one that cemented me as a big fan! You see it starts out in this little movie theater and goes into a confessional and even deals with suicide (her suicide). There is one happy little track, the track where the title is taken from ""So Pure"" that is free and probably one of her best songs.Alanis is a free spirit with a wonderful lyricaly sence and a great voice (I think so anyway). This is one of the most underated albums in the history of the world, you should pick this one up!"
1,Where is Jagged Little Pill 2?,"I used to be her fan, but now, very sorry to myself, i have to confess that her new songs really annoying me. Nowadays, its better still to listen to Natalie Imbruglia.The only songs i love is Thank You. This is rteally upseting me cos i expect somnething like Jagged Little Pill"
4,I find it better than Jagged...,"I had this one for almost 5 years but never heard it. When I read reviews of so many people calling it great, i tended to have a second look at it.. and i find it quite amazing.. one reason was that this time i listened it after listening to unplugged which is great. I didnt like it earlier because i didnt like either of the videos (thank you, so pure and unsent). Now i find thank yu an amazing song.My favourites would go like:1. Joining You.2. Thank You(she has excellent voice here when she says disillusionment and silence).3. Unsent.4. One.5. I was hoping.(much better in Unplugged)6. Heart of the House.7. The Couch.8. Baba9. Are you still mad10. Cant not.11. Your congratulations.12. Sympathetic character.13. That I would be good.14. front row. (isnt this somewhat overrated by everyone)15. UR.16. So pure.17. Would not come (??? is this a song????)"
2,Everything sounds the same,"I'm not sorry I bought the CD, but everything sounds pretty much the same on this one. Nothing really grabs my attention as on her first. Maybe with time..."
4,a very emotional and impressive piece of work,"This CD is a great motivation although it lacks variety in different styles. What I mean by that is her ""Jagged Little Pill"" CD had much variation but this CD consists of the same ideas throughout many of the songs. I like the fact that she is not influenced by what others think and expresses her own opinions through her music. I would listen to this CD when depressed or in a bad mood. One similarity between both albums is that they both motivational. My personal opinion is that the good views outweigh the bad and I look forward to purchasing this CD."
2,Nowhere near her first CD,"I've spent all day listening to her CD over and over again at work, and can't seem to find the connection with her music as I easily did to her first CD. Her second CD is heavily dependent on repetition; however, the repetition is not catchy nor listenable. ""Thank U"" was definately engineered to be the ""radio hit"" to bring in buyers. Her quest to show us she has not sold out has dissuaded me - her poppy music backing up her angst-filled lyrics are what drew me to her in the first place. This follow-up is very reminiscent of Dave Matthew's recent CD, Before These Crowded Streets - another dark, unlistenable, experimental work suitable only for the hardcore fan, determined to love the band regardless of the material they put forth."
4,Canadian male musician that tried to hate her but could not.,"Well , being Canadian makes me a touch biased right off the bat , but I cannot help but be impressed and bewildered by this woman's sense of rhythm , vocal phrasing , and intensity. I am living in Panama City , Panama and have had my ""Jagged"" disc stolen because they are so starved for any type of music but salsa. Somebody rich send me the new disc; it won't be here for months! SALUDOS!"
5,GREAT!,"Supposed former infacuation junkie is great. I listened to it once, and it is worth a lot more listenings. I like the way Alanis changes her songs, she doesn't keep the same beat in every single one. I strongly reccomend this CD to anyone, even senior citizens! they will probably enjoy it just as much as anyone will."
3,Bold Move,"I may feel different about the rating I gave SFIJ here in a few weeks, now I'd give it 3.5 stars (unfortunately, halves aren't an option here at Amazon). Although I like JLP better - I think it's one of the best debut albums ever, despite the ""I Hate Alanis"" anti-fan clubs springing up all over the place - I think she was very smart with SFIJ.She could have easily followed the formula she set on JLP, but chose to expand herself, which is very commendable. I wouldn't be surprised if she came out with a killer for her third release, blending the best of her first two.There are several tracks on SFIJ which could be instant hits - Thank U is an obvious first single, and an excellent song, but Joining You (my personal favorite), UR, So Pure and That I Would Be Good could all easily be big hits. I also love Front Row a lot, but I don't know if the general public can handle the style of that song, with it's 27 syllable sentences in 15 syllable beats."
4,wait and see,"when i first hear this album i was sorta confused. what had happened to alanis? i could not understand her songs and this new weird sound.but as this was alanis,i kept listening and like it more and more.you have to MAKE these songs your friends,they don't jump at you.but this will make you appreciate them even more.it is very different from jagged little pill but alanis dared the experiment and in my ears it worked.so if you like alanis buy it.you might be dissappointed at the first listening but later you'll love it.i swear."
4,Junkie its verry goog,"This album it`s not a piece of art, but Alanis have a good voice, and the sound of the recording is exelent, she makes very good music."
1,Written in 6 weeks... and it sounds like it,"I read in Rolling Stone that this CD, music and lyrics, were put together in 6 weeks. Well, it sounds like it. A huge disappointment. This CD will certainly move Morrisette into the realm of one CD wonders (i.e. Pill). Save your money"
1,"not fond of it, thank you.","I must honestly say that i'm not a big alanis morisette fan. So i bought one of her CD's ( this one ) just to give it a try and i didn't like it at all. Honestly, save your money and don't even THINK about buying this one... it's not very satisfying, trust me."
2,Enjoy Alanis Without Guilt,"We ALL know that Jagged Little Pill was the product of AT LEAST three record company songwriters - no matter what the album credits say. I'm not saying that the songs on SFIJ are bad songs - on the contrary, with so many corporate dollars behind it, they are probably the best songs money can buy. Our enjoyment of Alanis should not in any way be tainted by the fact that she is a product, an invention of the recording industry designed to create more revenue. Even though her entire image - her entire persona, in fact - is utterly manufactured, we should still be able to find some meaning behind the words she sings. While some of us may hear REAL rage from, say, Diamanda Galas, it is somewhat comforting to know that commodified emotions, in the form of Alanis, Inc., can still elicit such strong empathy from a numbed listening public."
5,The best album by anyartist and the most underrated,"okay it's amazing to me to find people say this is garbage. I never wrote a review but I have to for this one. and how can people say ""pay special attention too..."" or"" this ths best song"". these are amazing beyond words from front row to Your Congratulations. I love all of them all the stories she tellsand the pictures she paints in your mind. if you guys just wanted her to just be angry like on JLP go listen to Coutney love or something.and I'm glad that her new alabum "" Under Rug Swept"" have the same maturaity she developed on this one.I can't wait for another album from her. an album that makes you think and listen carfully not just to rock your empty heads back and forth to empty angry words. and I don't mean that JLP were empty angry words. there were great songs there like frogiven , mary jane ,you house and alot more"
1,derivative,"pseudo-spirtual self-indulgence on the grand scale that only those with a record contract can have. If this is the way that she is going, I expect in 5 years it will be ""Alanis who????"""
2,Someone PLEASE piss her off again!,"Like everyone else, I had high hopes for this one, but I've got to concede disappointment. The rage is what made ""Jagged Little Pill"" so much fun, and now the edge is gone. Alanis, you've abandoned us! It's like she's apologizing to everyone she shredded in JLP, and explaining why she did it--if she's not beating herself up in the process."
1,Use it as a coaster - that's all it's good for.,"Most expensive coaster I've ever purchased.Extremely disappointed. Jagged Little Pill was wonderful - expressive, passionate, and moving. This CD, however, is mind-numbing, irritating, and worst of all boring. One track Thank U held my attention, the others were just ""noise"". Has she been to India lately? If that's what she was trying to immitate, perhaps she should have written lyrics for a talented Indian artist and saved herself some embarressment. Thank goodness she sold enough copies of Jagged Little Pill to have a comfortable existance -- this could only sell to those who are truly ""Infatuation Junkies"" of Alanis."
3,A different and a small step down from Jagged Little Pill,"Interesting and innovative, yet lacking the exciting and brilliantly composed music from Jagged Little Pill.Digestion of this CD is a bit more complicated compared to the previous one. A hot and spicy taco compared to the previous tender steak. Hey, but who doesn't like the tickling sweat and hot n' spicy flavor in the mouth after a good taco ?A bit dissapointing but a must for Alanis lovers."
4,Not better or worse...just different,One of those albums that you have to listen to a few times before you love it. Similar to Tori Amos' 'From the Choirgirl Hotel'... in that its an album totally different to its preceder but still really good.
5,Excellent!!!,"Those interested in JLP, i would say you are in for something new. SFIJ shows how much ALanis has matured, especially in her songwriting. Lyrics like ""Verbal Daggers.....you think i'm withdrawing the guilt tripping you"" were done beautifully. ""verbal daggers""- one of the many great metaphors nicely done by alanis. the second lyric i mentioned could be broken up. ""you think i'm withdrawing the guilt + the guilt tripping you"". absolutly brilliant!! only she could think of that!! An absolute great lyricist. That alone is worth getting. The music adds nice flavor and background. A new step for her, but works great. Alanis' voice has definitely improved. JLP was a little screechy at times but alanis definitely cleaned that up without losing her angst nature. Awesome album!!"
4,"'...Junkie', lyrically bold, musically brilliant.","Instead of obsessing over lost love and facinating with supressed anger as in Jagged Little Pill, Moresette has taken a brazen inner look at herself and, well...wrote an album about it! She wallows in self-analyzation and almost sociopathic diversity to the point that you can't help but find yourself thinking, ""hey, Ive noticed that too and it really bothers me!"" Accompanied with brilliant back-up music that compliments instead of just coincide with Alanis' bold and stabbing lyrical perspectives, ""...Junkie"" is the obvious choice for anyone's CD collection."
3,Second album comes in second place.,"I can honestly say that I enjoyed ""Jagged Little Pill"" much more than this album. These new songs have a lot of meaning, but the music and the rhythm of the lyrics don't fit together. It seems like some of the songs are just her rambling to background music. I like this CD, but it's lacking something that the first CD had."
4,I like some cuts,"When my sister got this Cd. I hated it. But now, I live it. I am a fan of JLP and Uninvited. Cuts such as ""Front Row"", ""Thank U"", ""Are You Still Mad?"", ""The Couch"", ""UR"". ""One"", ""Unsent"", ""So Pure"", and ""Joining You"" are really good. Others such as ""Baba"" and ""Sympathetic Characeter"" are not. Alanis is not as angry as she was in JLP in this CD so it is a tad different."
5,"I don't know how, but she got better","I have no musical education, I only like what I hear. Being very text oriented in my choices of music, this album took me by surpise. To quote Morrissey ""How can someone so young see the world so sad?"" I thought JLP was an excellent album and a hard act to follow but she did it. Mixing up tempo numbers with ballads and vise versa. Combining beatifull lyrics with great music. Why is uninvited only on the City of Angels CD? A track that would fit this album perfectly and would have crowned it even more. Does anyone ""feel"" the lenght of the album sometimes?"
3,Decent,I absolutely loved her first album and expected to do so for Supposed Former but it didn't happen that way. It had some good songs on it like Thank U and Are you still mad but it wasn't a good combination as Jagged. But however I guess it was worth my money.
2,Go see a shrink Alanis.,"I was disappointed. Like just about every other female on earth, JLP became my ""anthem CD""--and memorized every song on it. What made Alanis so much fun was the rage that we all need to let loose once in a while. Even ""Univited"" was along those lines...and I was a bit curious as to why that track was not to be included on ""Junkie"".But now we know...that track belonged on JLP. On the new CD, its like she's apologizing for everything she said on JLP, kind of like ""It wasn't you, it was me."" WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR THAT! Please VENT to us, Alanis, and save the self incrimination for your shrink."
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!,"Alanis Morisette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is even better than her fantastic debut album Jagged Little Pill. When I first listened to the CD, I thought it was a terrible miscalculation by Alanis as she deviates by quite a large amount from her past style, and, on first listening, I wondered if I had wasted my money on it. However, after having repeatedly listened to it for a week or so, it has definitely grown on me and I now love Alanis' new style (You have probably already heard her first single from the album, Thank U, and you'll probably know what I mean.) My favourite track on the album at the moment is almost definitely One, with UR and I Was Hoping coming a close second. If you do buy this album, and I would thoroughly recommend that you do so, listen to it a few times, allow it to grow on you ,and I promise you won't think you have wasted your money"
5,Alanis Keeps Getting Better And Better!,"This album is equally spectacular to her first album, but she is more grown up now. Anyone who has ever been scorned by a man or anyone, will love Alanis, especially Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie."
2,Bad Lyric Junkie,"Somewhere between Jagged Little Pill and Infatuation Junkie, Alanis forgot how to write a song without making a list or starting each phrase with the same few words (e.g.I was hoping, Thank U, Are you still mad). I could go on about my sadness. I could go on mourning her former song writing skills (you oughta know, comes to mind). I could go on making my point, but going on this way would be boring, like most of her new material. Granted Ironic and a couple others on Pill had the same repetition structures, but not to the annoying level as the songs on Junkie. Ironically, I like her new live album, though. She is a great live performer. . .no Tori Amos, but great."
1,Nothing new here.,"Alanis hasn't changed one bit since Jagged Little Pill. She still can't sing and her music has absolutely no purpose. I supposed being ticked off is a rwason to put out music. At least the folk artists knew how to write songs that meant something. These songs tackle no issues of importance. Please Alanis, stop releasing music and take the money and run."
1,What did you expect?,"Alanis is overrated. The whole world will find this out on Tuesday. (I already have- being a radio DJ is great, ain't it?) She cannot sing, she cannot play an instrument- all she can do is scream (and give us big headaches). Sorry, but you'll see what I mean. She's just another Top 40 act who means nothing to music in the long run. I would give her 0 stars if I could."
1,"They won't let me give ""0"" stars","I just listened to an advance tape of this cd, and it is every bit as dull and lame and whiny as the first! Just as the only ironic thing in ""Ironic"" was that NONE of the things in the song actually WERE ironic, the only thing to be thankful for in ""Thank You"" is that it eventually ends!! the only problem with that is that there are more songs afterwards, so it's a bit of a mixed blessing. I'm sure tis record will sell millions and millions, but all of you people who think that Alanis is SO deep and SO insightful and SO witty, why don't you go check out something by Christine Lavin, Nanci Griffith, Leonard Cohen, or Chuck Prophet? For that matter, even Weird Al is deeper than Alanis!!!"
2,Not her best,"I am a pretty big fan of Alanis. I own four albums in addition to this one, and have to say that this is definitely my least favorite. I bought the CD because it has the song 'That I Would be Good' on it, and after listening to it, I feel that is the only good song on it."
3,good but...,"What happened to the anger? I guess she got those feelings out on the last album. But I kind of miss it and expect her to vent instead of thanking. Oh well. I like ""thank you""."
2,Disappointed,"""Jagged Little Pill"" is possibly my favorite CD of the 1990's so I had high expectations for this one, but it was a real let down. Almost every song on ""Pill"" jumped off the radio or CD player and demanded your attention, I can barely remember a thing about the new CD after 3 listens. I hate the intros to half the songs. Alanis does not have a ""beautiful"" voice, and she needs tough arrangements around her songs to bring out its qualities. I am really disappointed in this one. I wanted to love it."
2,That this cd would be good even though it really sucked,"While I loved ""Jagged Little Pill"" I find this second attempt by Alanis to be of little substance. The originality of the first album is simply rehashed in this album and it is poison to the ears. Alanis is very talented but many of the songs such as 'are you still mad?' are nothing but shrieky lines of nothingness. Is it any surprise that her album was only number one for three weeks and then dropped off the top ten chart? NO it is not. Some advice Alanis- don't try to wow me. We don't want to hear you scream."
1,MY MOTHER SOUNDS BETTER,I bought my friend this for her birthday. I was sorry when I was forced to listen to it all during her birthday party. Alanis has the worst voice I've ever heard.If I hear Alanis croak out Thank U one more time I will scream. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
3,Alanis was okay...,I think that Alanis was a bit too much to listen to on this CD. I think that Alanis was singing with crazy vocals. I think that JLP is much better. My opinion is that I don't think you should buy this CD.
3,Just don't expect a rerelease of 'Jagged Little Pill',"First time I listened to this CD I skipped straight to track 3 - Thank U. Having heard it on the radio & TV, and was quite excited by this album. Next I flicked back to listen in from the beginning. My first thoughts were that she had made a terribe mistake, especially with the first track 'Front Row', but, having listened to it several times over, it's pretty good. Give it a chance, and it may even be as good as JLP. It's not for me, but then I'm vindictive at heart."
1,Is this even music?,"There are high quality CDs. There are low quality CDs. There is trash. There is filth. Then there is this. With vocals that sound like a cat or other domestic animal in excrutiating pain, Alanis will make your ears bleed on this CD. If you enjoy the seering pain associated with the above phenomena, you will love this CD."
3,"She sure is original, though.","There are several excellent tracks on this album, including ""Thank U"" and ""Joining You."" But the first thing that might annoy you about this album are the ""forced"" lyrics throughout the album. The rhyming of the vocals seems off - and that's why it's different from ""Jagged Little Pill."" Appreciate this album for its boldness and individuality - but if you're expecting another Head-Over-Feet hum-a-long, or an Oughta-Know-shout-a-thon, forget it."
5,"Too bad l can only give it five stars, it deserves a million","This is tied for my favourite cd ever, along with JLP. They are both very different though, she is obviously in a different place than when she wrote JLP. however they are both SO spectacular. I recommend this cd SO very much, you will NOT regret buying it. My favourite songs on it are Thank U, The Couch, I was Hoping, One, Would Not Come, Joining you and Heart of the House, although they are all the best pieces of music i have ever heard (well, tied with the songs from JLP that is haha) I recommend it highly, go buy it. :)"
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I have Jagged Little Pill and I love it, but this cd is too out there for Alanis, she can do so much better. She's getting pretty wierd on us. I think I'll just wait for her next cd to see if she is back to herself."
5,the one album i would take to a deserted island for eternity,"this album at first listen puts you off abit, come back for a second listen and a song hooks you, then another, and another. there is no bad songs, lyrically and musically this album is the best ive heard since patti smith. this album has affected me very deeply and sits in my cd player and my car cassette and i listen to it all day. alanis has become one of my favorites and i look forward to more, i didnt listen to her last all that much, i liked 5 songs on it, this is a masterpiece."
3,"Not hot, but lukewarm","I received this album for Christmas. I didn't have her first album to compare it to(I bought that after), but I was still a little disappointed. I'm not going to criticize her for not living up to her former work, because that's really not the issue. Some of her songs I found to be a bit creepy(ex. Sympathetic Character), and some didn't really have much MUSIC or melody in them(the same song, for example). However, there are more than a few reeming qualities. ""Front Row,"" ""The Couch,"" and ""UR"" are probably my favorites. I wouldn't listen to this every day, but once in a while it's a nice break from the conventional."
4,"Not as great as JLP, but good.","As I said, this wasn't as good as Alanis's first album, but I still liked it a lot. While JLP was very accusatory and Alanis really belted out the blues, SFIJ had a softer attitude. It was more of speaking to music as opposed to singing (which isn't necessarily bad)."
2,From a FAN,"For one thing, I am an Alanis Morissette fan, or at least an older one (from 1995-1998). Her first cd was brash, insightful and in-your-face. Ms. Morissette's second cd tries to be that, but falls short. Lyrically Alanis uses no structure like she did on JLP. On her first album she told stories; here they are just incomplete thoughts. Alanis has a wonderful voice which is refreshing to hear, but her lyrical attempt on this one is stale and the repetition is an eye sore. Try again Alanis."
2,my head hurts!,"this album has far too many songs about alanis complaining herself and her problems, out of the entire album there are only two songs which are worth listening to !thank you"" and ""so pure"" the rest is just her mumbling on about nothing ,she should really consider changing her name to alanis MOANassette"
4,A CD of Exploration,"For anyone considering buying this CD, I would recommend it, especially if you enjoy listening to Alanis' music. I was drawn to this CD by listening to Thank U, and it is still definitely the best song on the whole CD. Some other really great songs are UR, which has a really rhythmical beat and sound to it, and Unsent, which has a really understanding mood to it. All the songs on the CD explore emotions and feelings, and they are insightful. Overall, it's a great CD, I would rate it as a A- or B+."
4,"Not quite as good as Jagged Little Pill, but still great!","Alanis Morissette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album is a great follow-up to Jagged Little Pill, although I enjoy Jagged more so. When I first listened to it, I never thought I would get through it! 17 songs is quite a bit for an album in my opinion. It was hard to take ownership in the songs at first for me, to really catch the fever, if you will`. But after a few listens, Junkie caught fire for me. Alanis pretty much rocks and will continue to for me. But it would take a masterpiece and miracle for any album to outdo Jagged Little Pill"
5,Another blockbuster from Alanis,"Another poignant album from Canada's angst-ridden young singer. Alanis teams again with musician/producer Glen Ballard and mixer Christopher Fogel to create a 17 song collection of crystalline beauty. As on her 26 million monster ""Jagged Little Pill"", Morissette shares stories of personal hurt and crisis in her search for identity and acceptance. Her lyrics weave through the music in that edgy, evocative, unrhymed phrasing that invites you to feel her pain and pleasure. Enjoy!"
4,A new growth,"I wish I had never read any of the reviews. Befor i even heard the cd i didn't like it. People had tainted it for me. But when i got it I was hooked. She has grown as an artist. And she is now happy. Get it, you will like it trust me."
5,Highly underrated!,"This album left me breathless! Alanis has done it again and personally i think this is better than her first, it never leaves my radio! My favorite songs are, Front row, Sympathetic Character, thank you, can't not, joinng you, i was hoping, would not come, one and that i would be good. All songs are over 10 stars! Keep it up Alanis!"
2,"Loose the attitude, Alanis !","Alanis Morrissette should forget her new-found naked attitude and go back to writing good music. Every song on this CD sounds the same, and it isn't a patch on her previous album, Jagged Little Pill."
1,All you need to know is that SFIJ has Thank-U on it...,"If you buy the (Import) version of this album, it costs $90 American! Thing is you get exactly the same thing on the standard release. What were they thinking when they made that bitter and twisted decision? Just like Alanis don't you think? Seeing as she won't release any mixes of Thank-U it is better value to just buy this CD and take a gamble. The Import edition must be made out of gold for that price so the producers of SFIJ must be really confident it will sell. Personally I love her old stuff, this album needs a few good listens, they say she's not as Angry these days. She's eased up a bit with her success and that's not such a bad thing. The album artwork is pretty good too, I didn't realise it even had a title because afterall, that is what Alanis Morissette is all about."
4,Thank U Alanis,"This is one of those albums that, during the first listening, you think ""What the hell is this noise?"". But, after the third of fourth time through, you'll love it! I know that I do. Don't make the mistake of comparing it to Jagged Little Pill. It's a delightfully different album in its own right; musically pleasing and lyrically adventurous. Listen to it on headphones and enjoy the musical subtleties like the soft drums in ""UR"". My favourites include ""The Couch"", ""One"" and ""Joining You"". Each song has its own unique qualities, rather than being an album of all-alike material. Persevere, and you won't regret purchasing this wonderful joy to the ear !"
4,"Different, yet very listenable","In terms of technique, quality of voice, and musical style, Alannis does not excel. However, WHO CARES??Alannis is a unique artist who was one of the first musicians to put FEELING into her work. It does not matter to me that she does scream and not does play an instrument. She made an album that is ORIGINAL, AND NOT A CARBON COPY OF HER FIRST.Some of her songs take a little getting used to, but when you do, SFIJ is well worth the money. Enjoy."
5,"GREAT, WONDERFUL, EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC, AMAZING......","I must write this, even I'm not so good in English. Everybody was waiting for the new A. M. album, specially after Jagged Little Pill. I didn't expect a miracle, but it really happens. New album is great, ""Thank You"" is my most favourite song, and I'm very satisfied and full of happiness."
3,Not what is expected.,"It wasn't exactly Alanis. I have respect for her though, at least she had the courage to change so drastically. From the angry hater girl to the calm and content woman. She just had this image and I think she disappointed some of her fans.(Including me.) I would rather listen to some angry hater girl like Courtney Love."
5,A great book!!!,"I first read this book three years ago after hearing it introduced during ""Black History"" month. I have purchased 5 copies of this book as presents for friends. I now teach middle school Reading and have read this book 21 times to 6th, 7th or 8th grade students. All really get caught up in the story and end up loving the book."
1,Why The Sun Only Recieved One Star,"I read this book several weeks ago, hoping for a good result. Instead, I got the exact opposite. Sharon M. Draper was very violent in the telling of this story, and also includes many other terrible things, including (but not limited to) violence, raping, and profanity. The reason that this book did recive one star is because yhe jacket art was somewhat pleasing to the eye. Kids, don't try this book at home."
4,Copper Sun,I needed this book quickly for my sons report. It came by mailed promptly and in good condition. My son was able to get his report done on time.
2,GOOD QUALITY....DIDNT LIKE BOOK.,The book came flawless. like new. it was shipped on time and everything. i didnt like the book itself but other than that the quality of this shipment was great.
5,VEEEEEEEEEEERY Good!,"Copper Sun was an exceptional book. I completely fell in love with it. The characters were well developed, the plot wasn't very predictable, and it gave me a sense of awe and wonder when I finished it. The book is under the genre of historical fiction and is about a 15 year old slave girl who was captured and sold into slavery from her native home in Africa. However, this isn't your typical fly-away-to-freedom slavery book. Amari, the main character, was raped and brutally beaten before she escaped to freedom with her white friend and a young boy. Sharon Draper offers two perspectives-that of Amari and of her white comrad Polly. Ironically instead of escaping to the North, they escape to the South where a non-discriminatory fort exists. There all are free and equal which is extremely uncommon during the year 1738. I won't tell anymore-you have to read it for yourself!"
5,Sharon Draper Does it Again!,"Sharon Draper is one of my favorite authors. Each and every single one of her books that I've read so far are far beyond the work of a novice author. Her writing is exquisite and one-of-a-kind. I first read 'Copper Sun' a year ago and I could not put the book down! It was one of the only books I have ever had emotion for the characters. I could not predict what was going to happen like i can with most other books. It describes the details of slavery so vibrantly that it was like i was right alongside Amari. This book is a MUST HAVE for all teenage and young adults. I couldn't recommend it more. Kudos, Sharon Draper!"
3,Shrinks up quite small,"This is just what I was looking for but it shrunk pretty small when it got wet. I can hardly use it to wash my back. Nothing else on the market, tho."
2,Sympathetic View,"A sympathetic view of a band of Arab laborers who are undergoing a good deal of economic distress as their underground jobs in Israel begin to dry up. Interesting points of view regarding their family backgrounds, comradeship and feelings about mideast politics. On the other hand, it's not a film you'd really go out of your way to see. Subtitled"
3,Compelling subject.,"Though compelling story about the horrible conditions that some Palestinian workers must endure in order to make a living, I found the movie too long and too one sided."
5,Elite electric video screen,The ordered screen arrived quickly and in good condition. The product meets all expectations. I am very pleased with Amazon's role in my acquisition of this screen.
4,Great Economical Screen,We bought two of these for our church a year ago and they have been great. We have not had any issues with them and the price was incredible. You can't beat the value with these screens. Just understand they are not super high end and you will be happy.
4,great item,"We are very pleased with the quality, workmanship, and mechanical capabilities of the screen. The only tiny problem we had is that the box it was shipped in is very flimsy, and we had to return two other screens due to damage in shipping. It took weeks of ""overnight"" shipping to finally get one that wasn't damaged."
4,"Very Pleased, almost 5 stars","This item was received very fast and was packaged well. There wasn't a scratch on it when I removed it from the box. The installation was a breeze. I put it up by myself with the assistance of a 6' step ladder, but would recommend it as a two-person procedure if you have an available and able body around. The screen motor is very quiet and I'm more than satisfied the picture quality, I watched Avatar to break it in. Both the wall mounted and remote control devices function flawlessly. Overall, a great value for the money spent. I would have given it 5 stars, but was very disappointed when getting ready to redeem the ""free"" projector screen mount rebate and saw that shipping and handling were $22.00. I've been looking into projector mounts of various quality and prices and most will ship for less than $8.00. Leave the disappointing bait and switch mount offer out of the box and it's 5 stars."
5,Value for price!,"Went through a lot of reading in regards to home theater screens. Scoured every forum i could find in regards to the subject matter concerning screens, screen type, screen material, gain...all that. If you are on a budget its simple. Price was the winning factor. I am a happy camper. It does its job. Your milage may vary. A hint to screen buyers in general, go with gray if you have a dark theater environment."
4,Great screen,"I experienced a perfect delivery. I ordered, within 1 hour I had an email for a delivery contact number. Couple days later I got a call to set-up delivery.The item was packaged great, and the item was received in perfect condition. I was astonished with how large this screen is in person.. astonished and incredibly pleased. It's a very very nice screen, and easy to set-up.The motor is a tad on the loud side... i.e not silent, but this isn't a problem, more of an observation. The motor on the unit I received was also making a thuding sound as the screen moved up and down, however, after about a week of use the thud'ing stopped and everything works as advertised. I would recomend this screen to anyone looking for a low-cost (budget) electic screen without hesitiation. I could not be more happy with my Home theater setup. Every time I walk by my Theater room I catch myself grinning like a child. FANTASTIC ORDERING EXPERIENCE from beginning to end. A+++"
5,Great screen,This is everything we had hoped forFed Ex hand delivered the screen within 2 days of purchasing. Very easy to set up. Simple remote and the screen is electronic which is a plus.I would recommend this to everyone who needs a screen. We have a 3d projector and watch regular TV on it
1,"Item just ok, packaging stinks","Item delivered by UPS. Red lettering says it left the warehouse in perfect condition. By the time it reached me the box had been retaped and was either a used screen or damaged during shipment. Sent it back and ordered another. Next one delivered with a huge dent in it. UPS determined that the packaging is inadequate. Be warned! -to send it back, UPS wants to charge you half of what the screen costs. If I had to do it over again, I would run from these guys. There's a reason it's so cheap. Screen itself is wavy and does not seem to hang properly. You get what you pay for with this one. Lesson learned."
3,So So,"I like the way the screen motor runs smooth, however my box did not come with ANY screws which was a HUGE dissapointment. The manuel mentioned supplied screws being used, so I think the company must've forgot. Also the screen is alittle creased for some reason at the bottom, like it bows out alittle/. I still like the screen, but paying over 2 Hundred is not worth it. Amazon did take care of me, so good job amazon"
1,BAD PRODUCT,"Im very, very, disillusioned , my screen arrived and don work only noise click when press down or up, i imported this screen to Mexico, and is very expensive for me return it, and support, of elite, tell me, im sorry dont service outside of USA. FAVI is better . Bad luck."
3,"The clicking on mine is pretty annoying, but it works well enough.","I understand everyone else's unit seems to be quiet as heck, and a few other people have defective units that just ""click"" and don't open or close... Mine goes up and down normally, everything seems smooth, but every 10 inches or so I hear a loud ""clik-CLICK!""It keeps opening or closing and stops when it's supposed to. Just an annoyance. Not really worth it for me to return it, but personally I'd probably try a different brand before buying one of these again.Does anybody have any idea what could be causing the clicking? I'd absolutely love for it to go away."
4,Works with everything,"What the title refers to is the fact that whenever operating a remote, any remote, there is a miniscule chance that it will also activate the screen, causing it to rise. (I have noted the effect from three different remotes) It happens rarely enough that it is humorous, but it is a flaw that should be rectified. Otherwise, the product fulfills its purpose well enough, although a couple of ripples in the top corners are a bit annoying when there is ambient light."
5,"Video of 125"" Elite Screen rolling down","Length:: 1:13 MinsWith all the positive reviews about this screen, I felt it would be useful for you to be able to see the power screen rolling down so you can see how long, smooth, and quiet the operation is. Mine is the 125"" version."
5,This is a great screen!!!!!,This was my first screen and the price was great. Makes you feel like your at the movies. Great buy!
2,"homecoming,,,i rather stay away","There is a great difference in story telling between the original stir of echoes and this one. I guess the original writers did not do this one which is very apparent, it has fallen off and not an interesting movie. The soldier coming home from war angle could have been better,,,I mean war is a horrible thing,,,so is this movie!!!"
1,Review for bench seat cover,"Item was packaged nicely and shipped fast, however the material in which this product is made is very cheap. Cover has unraveled and already has holes in it after less than a week of use. Would not purchase again."
1,Doesn't get much crappier than this!!,"I've been buying and installing this general type of seat cover for years. I just fool with older full size trucks from the 70's and 80's, so you can always count on the seat being badly worn especially on the driver side. These blanket type covers are always aggrevating to install with all the little strings or straps to route and tie off, so I expected some problems even before ordering this item. I knew I was screwed when the cover came out of the box in two pieces and there were precious few attached straps for attachment. The material is CHEAP, THIN, and like SANDPAPER. And full size my hiny!! Just now got return authorization from Amazon and it'll be on the way back tomorrow. I wouldn't buy this thing again for half the price paid!"
1,Horrible.,"After a year and a half of use, I had to remove this because it disintegrated from exposure to the sun. It got tiny fibers all over my truck. It literally fell apart in my hands and had to be vacuumed out. I can't imagine a worse material to use for a seat cover."
2,Not full size,I have a 1991 GMC 2500 and it is too small to fit properly. The fabric is good though. A little extra is good. Not quite enough makes it useless.
4,Great cover,I bought this for my husband's truck and he really liked it. It doesn't show dirt much and he loves the pockets in the front.
5,A book of insight,"Berman writes with grace and clarity. He presents a persuasive overview of the principal problems affecting American culture. His book is prophetic of the bursting of America's bubble economy. While powerfully critical of American culture, he provides some hope for the long-term future. Thus his ""pessimism"" has a constructive side to it. A must read for those deeply concerned about America's future."
4,what about the cover?,"Sorry to be nitpicking here, but who allowed this ghastly cover to blanket such an important book? W.W.Norton or the man, Berman, himself? What do brand new candles have to do with the collapse of a society, or the dawn of the same? This cover must be changed, thus giving the content a new push towards a well deserving readership; after all this is not a book about power outage or wax making!!!! Please!"
2,feel-good pseudo-rebellion,"The author is far less profound than he seems to think. He evidently takes pride in being pompous, looking down with a scowl on those he finds inferior, i.e. the populace at large. He derides multiculturalism because it infringes on the legacy of his favorite white male writers. I'm not someone to attack writers as pretentious, but Berman would wear the term with pride on a merit badge. I won't say that I didn't get anything out of this book, and altogether I agree with him on a number of things, much of this book is just the author spitting on people, with a few vague rants against corporations and the American political system."
3,Just ok...,"...while I'm agreement with Berman's point of view on the state of American culture, there are much better books in the genre--several of which he quotes. For a thoughtful, considered approach, Sven Birkerts' ""Gutenberg Elegies"" is far superior--Birkirts analyzes, but does not offer far-fetched ""solutions"" such as the NMI (though he probably is one).On the other hand, if you're simply looking for a sympathetic rant, Paul Fussell's ""Bad"" for is much more entertaining and his ""solution"" to the problem is a more realistic way to not be a societal lemming."
4,Good but with a problems,"I found the book overall pretty good, but somewhat light as to content. There should have been more information offered for the price. What I did find interesting though was that the author rails against corporate america and publishing conglomerates, yet his own book is published by one of them. Moreover,the author says that because readers are into new age and don't like to think for themselves publishers like to print new age books that are distantly removed from common sense and critical thought. The reason for this is that those types of books sell well. Well, if this is indeed the case, why was his book published? The problem in the book is that the good professor falls victim to the harsh generalization fallacy. He gives examples and then paints with too broad of a brush. This is a common mistake form people who think they know it all, but if they did they should have known better in the first place!"
4,Clear and Concise,"Morris Berman sets out a clear and concise argument concerning the current state of American culture. His assessments and prescriptions, while sobering, contain a long-term hope. This book is for those who are looking for thought that is clearly expressed; that goes beyond the groupthink of the politically correct or the mind-numbing jargon of the academically postmodern."
4,"Inspirational, if whiny","Berman seems to have a tendency to write books which are good foe inspiration and reference, but really not that good otherwise. The celebrated ""Twilight ..."" appears to be more of the same.It certainly is GREAT that someone with a degree of intellectaul astuity takes upon to (yet again) write a book on the poor state of American public culture and social life. Really GREAT! I actually re-read this every so often to keep my anti-establishement anger churning when heavy sarcasm is about to set in after watching electorial debates on TV or what not.But, dude, the style, the moaning, the whining, the aweful predictions. Morris, we love you, but gain a sense of humor, please! Spend time concentrating on obtaining the actual religious experience that you promoted so actively (and rightly) in ""Coming back ..."". Please, you really need it! :)"
3,"Excellent diagnosis, questionable prescription","Morris Berman accurately describes America's millennial malaise -- from runaway global corporatism to anti-intellectual infotainment. He also provides an excellent path for individuals to resist this tidal wave, a monastic Thoreau-like lifestyle dedicated to preserving our arts and humanities.I have one problem with the book -- it's overwhelming pessimism about American democracy. I disagree with Berman's belief that the current problems in America are beyond repair and that it is either useless or destructive to participate in public life. I'd prefer the path of Enlightened Populism -- like Bruce Springsteen, I believe in a promised land. Our inability to use our democratic tools effectively may, in part, be due to this fashionable dropping out, which Baby Boomers seem to wear like a badge of honor.Read Berman for his excellent analysis of what's wrong with our modern culture, but ignore his pessimism. There is always a way out of the morass."
5,Read along with his 'The Reenchantment of Nature',"If the pessimism is too much, Mr. Bermans previous book 'The Reenchantment of Nature' might offer some respite. Ever since reading that book almost 20 years ago now, I have looked forward to a sequel, and am not disappointed!Personally, since reading HG Wells' 'The Time Machine' as a kid, I have needed no convincing in envisioning a future Dark Age when benighted and simple-minded Eloi will live at the whim of the technocratic Morloks.Yet, perhaps, even the Morloks may forget their craft! Who can say?Imagine, 100 years from now, people looking back on the fading magazine pictures of the Space Shuttle and PC's with wonder and confusion as the electric light flickers overhead with the coming of another power outage that no one will know how to fix.Monasticism might not be a bad idea. I wonder if Mr. Berman was inspired by the scifi story 'A Canticle for Leibowitz'?"
4,Read This and Weep,"I have read all of Ansay, and like her work alot. I never just read her work, I feel it. This collection shows that short stories are her strength. My favorites were the title story, Lies, and Spot Weaknesses. No one who's been a girl or had a daughter should miss Spot Weaknesses. It captures perfectly the pain of adolescence and the mother/daughter dance. Evolution is wonderful, too. Ansay has a way of crystalizing details and exposing emotional truths that we all intuit but rarely articulate. She manages to consistently get things ""right"", including the snapshots of animals which inhabit virtually all of her stories. I got this book from the library, but plan to buy it to reread and share."
4,a good read,"I enjoyed reading this book of short stories so much that I bought a copy for my mom. She enjoyed it too. It's definitely not an uplifting collection, but the pieces feel honest and real."
5,Jacket missing,"Purchased this used which was a great deal at the original price. Unfortunately, without the jacket, the black and white drawings didn't show the finished animals in color. Otherwise I was so happy to have found this."
5,Buy this book,"This book is as well written as any about WWII ""Thunderbolts"" that I have read. Not only do you get an American perspective, there are comments made by the Germans as well. I tried reading ""Winter Journey With The 9th"", but it paled in comparison to this one. The big difference really boils down to is this book is written by a pilot who can write versus a third person account."
4,Camera accessories kit,"The case is great to keep the camera safe when traveling with it, and the extra battery is very convenient to have as well."
2,Read the accessory kit contents carefully.,"Two different neck straps, a case that doesn't fit all that well, and a battery? If you need a extra memory card (and you will), you'll have to buy it separately. The kit was overpriced and not terribly useful, and since my wife was in a hurry, she misread the web entry and bought two! I would personally recommend buying an extra battery or two along with memory cards and a different, neoprene case, not this thing, but that's just my opinion."
4,Pretty Good,"It is good to get the case and strap for the price that other places sell the battery only. Unfortunately, a spare battery is pretty much a necessity for the camera. This case is pretty nice for carrying it around. It fits the camera tight, so is not a ""travel"" case. It isn't made to fit a spare battery or charger. But, I've found you can jam a spare battery in there with the camera. You do have to completely remove the camera to take a picture though and the battery will fall out while you're at it. The strap is pretty nice, but the camera gets heavy around your neck after just a short time."
3,Base on your needs...,"The battery is no doubt a good extra to keep. The case, well, turned my SD630 from a real compact cute gadget, to a regular carry-with-you camera. The case itself is beautiful and well made, but slightly larger for SD630. Now I am keeping the camera in my purse without the case due to its size."
3,Case is too big 4 SD1000,It was a good packaged deal (came with an original Canon battery and leather case) but the case is too big for my Canon SD1000 camera. I may purchase another case for it.
2,Don't buy it if you only need a battery.,"It looks like a good deal, but don't be fooled. If you need a nice battery then buy a replacement from Lenmar: DLC4L or DLC5L which have 3yr warranty. Then pick up a nice camera bag with an accessory pocket. All for $20 for a smart shopper."
3,"Great case, battery is helpful, rest is not needed",I love the case. Not too ugly. Well padded for those clumsy moments. The battery is always nice. But the price is too high for this set. I would not buy it again. I'd just get want I want individually.
5,Excellent,Excellent buy for the money. Handy carrying case that slips onto your belt and easy to use. I also needed the extra battery and carrying strap. Much cheaper than if bought seperately. Highly recommended.
5,Perfect for my Canon SD1100,"I bought this case despite the fact that my camera model wasn't listed along with the suitable camera models. However, it did list the SD1000, which is perhaps the closest to my Canon SD1100. I received the case today, and it looks great! Better yet, it fits my camera perfectly! The neck strap is something I probably won't use, but it is nice in quality. Also, the extra battery is definitely nice to have. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality case for their Canon Digital Elph."
5,Just what I expected from Canon,"Excellent little digital camera with a 3"" LCD rear display and 6.0 megapixels. So far I have had this camera for about 7 months and have no problems. Takes great pictures and is a great entry level camera for novices like me that just want to capture moments in our life as our 3 year old twin daughters grow up.If you purchase this camera, you should also purchase the accessory kit that comes the leather case and and extra battery, that way you always have a charged battery and the leather case is of very good quality.I highly recommend this camera for novice or intermediate weekend shooter.It's great to look at the shot you just took on the 3"" screen. I also like the way the menu functions were laid out. I noticed a few people gripped about this, but I have big fingers and can be clumsy at times and it has always worked great for me."
4,Another good read!,I continue to be pleased with the Bosch series. The characters are interesting and the stories compelling. It is unusual for me to conitie to remain engaged with a character for this long. Kudos to Mr. Connelly!
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""The Poet""","While ""The Poet"" was an amazing rollercoaster ride, brilliantly crafted and left you wanting more, this follow-up really missed its mark (as truth be told most, if not all, sequels do).As a stand-alone book, I may have given it higher praise since it is indeed interesting, fast-paced and has some twists and turns which keep you on your toes, however since it was based upon the original book, ""The Poet"" which was so phenomenal, it begs comparrison and I can't rate it higher.***NOTE: if you haven't read many of his previous books, as I have not, this book seems to give away details of a few of them in particular, which was frustrating since I have them on my book shelf ready to read but now feel like I know how they'll end. I guess if you read Connelly, you have to read his books in order.If you're interested in Michael Connelly, I highly recommend ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" and ""The Poet,"" which can be read without regard to his earlier works."
2,Just ok....,"This is the first Connelly novel I had a chance to read. I have to admit that this is not the best mystery novel I've read. There's not much mystery behind it. The ""who dunnit"" is revealed at the beginning of the book. There are no real twist and turns that one would expect from a good mystery novel. It was just an average read."
3,Solid novel but no page-turner,"Connelly follows The Poet with The Narrows but fails to deliver the suspense and surprise of The Poet. Although it lacks the grip and twists of The Poet, The Narrows provides a basic, well-written mystery novel.The Narrows builds interest slowly as it incorporates characters from The Poet and includes the detective Harry Bosch from other Connelly mysteries. Once the story and case develops, it becomes more interesting and eventually leads to a satisfying end without much in the form of fireworks or climax.I like the two deliveries used in the book by Connelly. He writes chapters in first-person narrated by Harry Bosch and writes other chapters in third-person. It provides variety and interesting takes on point of view."
4,The Poet is back with a vengeance,"Harry Bosch, now working as a private detective, is asked by the wife of his friend Terry McCaleb to look into Terry's death, which appears to be unnatural. The trail that Harry finds when going through Terry's files leads him into the desert of Nevada and into the hands of the FBI, who are unearthing a mass burial site of The Poet, the serial killer that featured in the book that made Michael Connelly world famous. Together with fallen-from-grace FBI agent Rachel Walling Bosch follows the trail of The Poet to a small brothel-town and from there to Los Angeles, all the time running into gruesome killings that are the hallmark of The Poet. The apotheosis of the book happens in the pouring rain. Another authentic Michael Connelly with all the features of a good detective book, but not as nail-bitingly exciting as some of his previous books."
3,Frustratingly slow,"Michael Connelly is an excellent author who needs a better editor. Most of his offerings get needlessly bogged down in the first half, then proceed to pick up pace to a good conclusion. There are too many characters, especially women, in The Narrows, and the reader thinks, ""WE GET IT!...LET's DEVELOP the plot already!"". We know and understand Bosch and just want to see him unravel the murders. This book should have been sliced in half for a better read."
4,Another good read by Connelly,"This is another good, fast-paced read by an accomplished author. The plot is tight and believable. Hired by the widow of Terry McCaleb (main character in BLOOD WORK and other Connelly novels), Harry Bosch looks into the seemingly natural death, but is drawn into the master plan of serial killer, Robert Backus (THE POET). Harry teams with an outcast FBI agent, Rachel Walling, to try to move past the one-step-behind trail that the killer dangles in front of them. You don't have to read Connelly's books in the order he wrote them to enjoy them, but he puts in enough inside references that I would recommend that you go back and start with THE BLACK ECHO."
4,my first Bosch book,"This was my first book by the author and for me it was a good read. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes good page-turning suspense. I wasn't aware this was the latest of a series, but that didn't bother me. Some of the plot development towards the end didn't garner four star ratings, but the writer is so good at what he does I could see myself re-reading this book in the future. Very Good!"
4,Harry Bosch does it again.,"I have enjoyed this series. I prefer Harry as a cop, and here hi rejoins the PD st the end. These books are entertaining and the stories well written. Rarely am I able to second guess the plot."
5,Great to the last page!,"This is another great read by Connelly. He is a masterful suspense writer. Just when you think you have it figured out, the story takes an unexpected twist that leaves you wanting more."
2,Well Written but Rushed and Full of Dead Ends,"I read The Poet and was entralled by Connelly's plot, character development, and writing style. The Narrows, however, has none of the magic of The Poet. This novel seems rushed, and the ""twist"" or psuedo-captivating plot devices are second rate. I really like Connelly's writing style, and this novel captivates in that area. What happend to Jill? Why the flat, meaningless ending to the Terry McNabe case? What happened to the multi-faceted hypnotist angle for Bacchus? This novel has too many dead ends, and it smacks of being rushed to meet a publisher's quota."
3,"Great start marred by weak supporting cast, mediocre ending","I love the Bosch series, and was really looking forward to this latest installment. However, after a great set-up, the plot/character development seemed to run out of gas. The ending felt especially rushed, like it was tacked on to meet a deadline.Bosch, as usual, is solid and always enjoyable. But Walling, and most disappointing, Backus, are mere caricatures who feel like cardboard cutouts to Harry's fully-realized persona.The climax and eventual denouncement are below par for Connelly. Hopefully, Harry's return to the homicide desk will move the series back to its standard of excellence."
2,Poorly written,"Connelly has been on a downhill slide since ""Chasing the Dime"". What was once interesting writing is now simply banal. Maybe the movie has gone to his head. I did not need to be constantly reminded of it in this book. Sort of like an actor breaking the fourth wall- a professional no no."
2,Weak and derivative,"Having been a longtime fan of most of Connelly's work, it is with some sadness to report that this novel does not add to his often stellar oeuvre. The Poet, an earlier serial killer marked by his menacing ingenuity, returns as a cut-out villain lacking smarts and a great degree of threat in this tired thriller. In what amounts to a reunion of sorts for prior Connelly characters, Harry Bosch seems too human and well-drawn to be occupying this world of caricatures and plot cliches. Connelly namechecks two other crime authors, George Pelecanos and Ian Rankin, who are both writing at a superior level at present. Check them out instead."
3,so-so,"having recently read ""the lincoln lawyer"", this was a bit disappointing. the story moves along o.k., but i wouldn't say i was on the edge of my seat. also, the villian is a complete knock-off of hannibal lechter."
2,not again,"This novel didn't really work for me. I just think it's like a dozen other novels that I've read. It brings nothing new to the table. Novels about serial killers have become a dime a dozen. You would think we have hundreds of serial killers based on the proliferation of them in crime novels. The other thing that strikes me as trite is that the serial killer is a former FBI agent. I have seen this done so many times that it makes me yawn, not to mention that it's horribly unrealistic. To my knowledge I am not familiar with any real like police officers who were also serial killers yet thriller novelists treat this as a normal occurence. The plot was trite and dull. I would advise to skip this one.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
3,Middle of the Road.,"This is the first Bosch novel I have read. I was looking for something in the private eye genre that had more of an edge to it then the Robert B. Parker Spencer novels. To a certain extent this book delivered. It was an intense story, although the characters were somewhat flat and predictable.The basic premise of the book was good. A former cop looking into the death of his old partner at the request of his partner's wife.My only complaint was that the book drags on longer then necessary. In an attempt to make the story more true to real life the author made parts of the investigation tedious. This book would have been better if he picked up the pace. 3 Stars."
3,The Narrows,"I really like HaRRY Bosch mysteries, however, this one was kind of routine and not that exciting. It still was a fast read though."
5,Excellent,I absolutely loved this book. But I have read almost all of the Harry Bosch series and I can't wait for the next on to come out. They are very good and I really enjoy the humor and sitting on the edge of my seat with every book wondering how Harry is gonna get out of this mess. LOL Would recommend them to everyone. I really enjoy Michael Connelly and how easy it is to get into the books he writes and to feel like you are right in the middle of it all. Keep up the good work and please let Harry live on forever. :)
5,Bosch At His Best,"Excellent storyline. Connelly weaves an excellent story with excellent characters and plot. Bosch has flaws which makes him human, but one flaw he doesn't have is ability to analyze a crime and his attention to detail. Hope you enjoy it."
4,Literary potato chips,"These books, as mentioned in the title of this comment, is like literary potato chips. You don't get much out of the darker than the normal Connelly passages that this novel takes you through, but then again, you keep on reaching for that next page, much as you do another potato chip. And when you are done with the book and and realize that you also have an empty chip bag, there is that sensation of ennui."
1,Another crappy installment from Connelly,"Please save your money and do not buy this book. Connelly's early books were researched, thought-out and well-written stories. His past 5-6 titles have been pure garbage. This one is a pathetic attempt to get back to those original titles by bringing back his best villain. The book sounds like it was written by a much weaker writer and is full of holes. I thought I would give him one last chance to see if he could recapture the strong elements of his early works but I am now giving up on this ""author"". A total waste of time and money."
3,"Lose the gimicks, please.","While I like all of this author's books, this one felt a little like a stunt to me. The author seemed to go out of his way to have all his protagonists from previous novels meet, and the one from ""Void Moon"" had no purpose other than to complete the set. The pop-culture references come fast and furious, including numerous references to the movie made based on ""The Poet"" and many other recent high-profile murders. I'm left to wonder if the book was too short and he needed to pad for length.There are a few major developments in the lives of his characters, so if you read the series, you'll want to make sure to read this one. Hopefully with the next book, the author will return to the form that drove me to read all his previous books."
3,Wow..More Painful than the dentist.,"This was my first Harry Bosch novel, so I guess I may have missed some of the charm of the characters. I listened to the Audionbook, unabridged. It was slow and uneventful. The charaters were flat, though the author tried to flesh them out but the characters for the most part lacked original drive and passion. This book was 11 hours long! There were so many gratuitous acts in this novel it was shameful.Read John Sanford and skip Connelly"
1,The sad state of publishing business,"How bad can a so-called thriller get? If it gets any worse than this I am sure it can cause dementia. There was something faintly interesting in the mediocre Poet but Narrows... There is nothing you could call a decent plot, no interesting characters, no good writing. Oh my what tricks this guy uses in the end! I appeal for a law to ban less than half-baked serial killer ""thrillers""."
4,The suspense builds and the pace is relentless. This one will be hard to put down.,"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main characters are saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
3,Ho-hum,"A typical ""3-plots intersect thriller"" preferred by the masses. Perhaps, because I hadn't read the previous book dealing with the Poet, I didn't have the backstory I needed to properly induce suspense and terror. Written at about a 6th grade reading level, this book moves along quickly and has all the hallmarks of a typical ""Bestseller"" with none of the hallmarks of ""Literature"". But hey, it makes money for the author, so who am I to criticize?"
3,Not Up To Par,"Though Michael Connelly is a favorite, and I'll still buy every book he writes, The Narrows gave the sense of being written too quickly -- perhaps to meet a publisher's deadline. Several story lines cried out for larger development -- some chapters were as disappointingly short as those of James Patterson."
3,Boring and unimaginative,"I like Connelly, and read The Poet.The biggets problem is that ""The Poet"" was a thriller, while this book is more of a hybrid mystery-thriller. But the pace is way too slow for a thriller.The Jane character was weird and left completly unresolved.The characters seemed to be stereotypes and shallow. Rachel was made even more shallow than in ""The Poet"".I kept hoping it would pick up, or something would surprise me and it didnt happen.The ending was unbeleivable.Without giving anything away.Why wouldnt ""The Poet"" have just killed the guy, instead of telegraphing everything?Why would he wait 8 years?It seems like this was a book his publisher wanted, so he gave it to them."
5,A must read,"Deception, intrigue, thrills, and mystery - what more could you ask for? This latest entry in the Harry Bosch serries is another winner. In this book we get to see a little deeper inside Harry, and he does redeam himself with the police department. Besides the great plot, this book delivers complex, believable characters, which is what keeps drawing me back to Connely's writing. Two other books that I enjoyed were ""Anna Karenina"", and ""He Never Called Again."""
2,Save Your Money,"I've always looked forward to Connelly's latest, unfortunately, this one could have stayed on the shelf. He's starting to use cliches and plot devices in lieu of strong, believable characters and well thought-out plots. As he likes to point out in nearly every chapter, one of his books was made into a movie. A nice accomplishment, but this wasn't the place for self-promotion.As for the plot of 'The Narrows,' balancing a previously unknown, cute-as-a-button daughter with the hunt for an out-for-glory serial killer, and interest in a female FBI agent who is little more than a dumb-blond, only leads to BIG plot holes that don't create much energy for the story or a believable ending. Disapointing to say the least."
3,Competent traditional detective novel.,"&#65279;The portrayal of the chase of the serial killer was interesting and engaging, but lacked originality. The ending was anticlimactic. Mr. Connely writes adequately and provides an interesting take on the title. A beach or airplane read."
2,Not for me,This book was given to me as a gift. I'm not an experienced reader of the Mystery genre and yet this book still felt like it was churned from a formula. The characters felt more like clich√©s than interesting people that I cared about. I'll stay away from any more books by Connelly and leave them for others to enjoy. Folks who had the same reaction as me may enjoy a great mystery by Michael Chabon titled: The Yiddish Policeman's Union.
5,Great sequel to the Poet.,"Michael Connelly's sequel to his hit ""The Poet"" is a worthy follow up that has a great lead character in Harry Bosch, Connelly's most interesting series character. The action is tease and the story is crisps and it's a worthy chapter in the Harry Bosch series. I rank it right up next to Angles Flight as one of the best in the series."
3,The Narrows,"Bummer!! I have read the Poet by Michael Connelly and was really anticipating reading The Narrows, however, I kept plugging away and by half way through, I figured out that I was going to be waiting and waiting and waiting for the plot to thicken. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. I have read several of his books and was pleased. I have to say this one was a bit of a drag. One can only hope for the next book."
3,Bosch versus The Poet,"I actually wondered why Harry Bosch had to make an appearance into the world that Connelly created with his great thriller THE POET. I have to honestly say it just didn't work for me. THE POET was a dynamite thriller with a definite sense of menace because any character was in jeopardy and the great twist was one of Connelly's best. But with Bosch on the case, you lose that sense of peril. Connelly is not about to kill off Bosch, so there is an inevitable predictability not found in THE POET. A solid mystery and some closure there, but overall I would have preferred to see Walling on her own against her mentor."
3,Narrowly missed 2 sleepless nights!,"My first book by Mike Connolly. Very intense, but the end was worth the wait. Final scenes were exciting and nail biting. I found it a nice read and will definitely read another to see if this author can do it again for me. Perhaps I began his books too late in the Harry Bosch series. I hope not."
3,Not his best work,"I have read all of Connelly's books and this one rates near the bottom. There is no real mystery involved and therefore less suspense than there might be. The combination of McCaleb (posthumously) with Bosch didn't generate that much interest. I was simply undewhelmed by this novel compared to his other works. Even so, Connelly is a talented writer and one of his worst is still worth a read and is a cut above most of the mystery novels out there."
2,never mind,"I am a big fan of M.Connelly but I was disappointed by this one to the extent that I did not finish it.First, there are practically no investigative elements in this book. Second, the book consists mostly of an endless series of pissing matches between everybody involved. Third, most of the actions/decisions seem either unmotivated or way too dumb.Never mind reading this one, it got its second star only because I had seen something worse."
5,What comes around goes around!!!!,"This book was a quick read, that showed the side of men getting hurt in the game. Tryin' to be a playa and look where it got them. A must read!!!!"
2,Save your money!!!!!!!,"After reading Mr Joseph's story, I could have closed the book. I've never read anything by the other two authors but after reading their efforts in this book, I'm not encouraged to purchase their work."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book only because Dwayne Joseph was a contributing writer. I was disappointed. Only When You're Lonely wasn't terrible... It was just a bit far-fetched and didn't grab me. Carter was a self-confident player in the beginning simply concerned about the $ signs and nothing else. He does a 180 and becomes smitten for Sam in a love-at-first sight episode that I couldn't connect with. Sure the feelings they had for one another were confessed...but it didn't seem real. Maybe because the story wasn't long enough? Who knows? Even the way Carter got caught up seemed fake. After this disappointing read, I barely gave the other two stories a chance before losing interest in the book. I wasn't a fan of Jihad's writing style and Roy Glenn's story was just filler.Dwayne, get with it again. I couldn't even believe you wrote this tiredness. I would like to see more work from you like Choices, The Womanizers, and your contribution to Dollar. I won't give up on you yet."
3,What a Vampire,"Very pleased with these, they are very soft and with lots of bass, you won't need a SW.The GRAND problem is that you will need a Monstruos amp for these Energy Vampires to deliver all their potential.Great but not THAT great, next time i'll go with Monitor Audio."
3,"While repetitive, does give a feel for Jackson, Confederacy","All diary type memoirs are repetitive and during those times writers were loathe to criticize fellow officers but in this book you can definitely tell that the writer thought Early was beyond his depth, that Ewell was lazy and that Jackson was hopeless without accurate maps. His comments on price inflation, desertions and politics are interesting. There are some other tidbits like the fact that Lee told him that the Union would have fewer troops in 1864! You really feel the loss of Jackson and other good officers and how morale had sunk to an almost nonexistent level by 1865."
1,Useless,"I will be returning this item. It may be cool air flow, but on high it took about 20 mins to dry a single 3x3 inch area of a thin-coated cocker spaniel."
4,Good for heat sensitive dogs,"I have an American Eskimo with a thick undercoat and she completely freaks out if I use a hot air hair dryer on her. I guess she gets overheated easily and even though I keep my hand down there to make sure it's not burning her, just the slightest bit of hot air makes her freak out.With the Crazy Dog Dryer I can dry her hair without her being uncomfortable or scared. It's not too loud for her and the air is just barely warmer than room temperature.The downside is it does take longer to dry her hair but I would rather it take longer than have her get so stressed out during the process! Using this dryer we are now much happier at grooming time and she sometimes even falls asleep while I'm drying her!I do wish this hair dryer had multiple heat settings though. The air is too cold for my sheltie pup and she shivers when I use this dryer on her."
1,misleading advertising,this product indicated varied settings....In reality this dryer submits no heat!!! Just air at different speeds....Very misleading information.....It is the stand that I needed most however so I am keeping this 'fan' product
2,Item arrived damaged,"This item arrived damaged. Also, the name used on the site was not the name used on the return label. Maybe they actually had a bad review in the past and felt the need to change their name on the site??"
3,Very helpful for the business traveler or tourist.,"If you've ever traveled overseas and not known how to ask where the toilet is in the language of that country, you can understand why it is so important to know a few very basic words when you are out of your own country. Berlitz's ""Around the World with 80 Words"" is a classic that should be kept in the library of every frequent traveler as a reference guide. Charles Berlitz, and the company of that name, are famous for their language programs. This guide tutors in words from 26 of the predominant languages of the world, including French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Scandinavian languages, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Hungarian, Greek, Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic, Swahili, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Thai, and Korean. Along with Morrison, Conaway, and Borden's ""Kiss, Bow or Shake Hands,"" it is a must for any business person who wants to honor his hosts and not embarrass himself."
3,OK,"It's OK, but still takes a lot of work for even the smallest mats. not sure why it had great reviews"
4,Good Fun,"My son loves Buzz. The Command Cruser gets played with regularly and has been ""launched"" more than once with no damage. The only issue we have is temporarly loosing the missle and the backpack."
4,Hours of fun,"My son and daughter play with this stoy all of the time. They love placing the characters in the cruiser then taking them out. It is a little hard for my three year old to close, but my 5 year old does fine. Buzz is a favorite at our house."
2,Awful,"I must admit my surprise to the good reviews for this book. With the h's incredulous shyness and the assumptive and tiresome H I became very bored with this book and almost quit reading. This is my first book by C. Hern and it will be my last. Neither the H or the h had any traits to recommend them and the ending seemed rushed and to convenient. In all this book was boring and tiresome. The entire book was an internal struggle of the h overcoming her shyness to tell the H what she really wanted and the internal struggle of the H to, first physically desire the h and then to take it slow with her as to not scare her. This book made me what to scream at the characters to 'just open your mouth and say it da**it'. If you decide to pick up this book, i severely recommend you think twice. However if you do I hope you can get over the h and H's unlikeable characteristics."
2,"wimpy heroine, deus ex machina ending","By and large I like Candace Hern's books, although occasionally she writes a clunker.In this book the characters are well-developed, but the heroine is a wimp. Why do all these women feel that being compromised even when they haven't done anything means they have to get married? How about telling society to take a flying leap instead. Then she continues being a wimp after she's married.The hero, although he supposedly believes in rights for women, is unable to treat his wife as an equal. This leads to a conflict at the end of the book. Is the conflict resolved by examination of his actions and principles? No, a solution falls from the sky."
2,Just didn't do it for me.,"This was my first by Candice Hern, and regretably I was disappointed. I have read all of Nicole Jordan, Lisa Kleypas, Gaelen Foley, Sabrina Jeffries, and many more. This book didn't have any sexual tension to speak of. The hero was a sweet idiot and the heroine was a plain dowd. Not enough chemistry for me and quite frankly, not enough romance."
2,very dull,"I saw the pretty good reviews of this book and expected a lot, consequently I kept reading expecting it to pick up, but it just didn't. Nick was basically a jerk; he (and this is a bad thing) seemed like an unnecessary character. He didn't have much depth and was annoying as was Pru whose shyness didn't disolve until about page 330. I couldn't take anymore blushing or stamering. The entire novel lacked quality dialogue/conversations. Finally, there seemed to be no basis for Pru's love for Nick and when he started to love her I just didn't understand how they could love each other and didn't believe it was possible in the way the novel was written. Basically this book was torturous to read."
4,Sweet Book,"This is my first book from this author..... And it wont be my last. It was a sweet love story, and I loved reading about the Ladies Cabinet.The reason it only got 4 stars from me, was not the writing, she is a wonderful writer, it just didn't grab me, where I couldn't put the book down. Took me over a week to read it, unlike my 5 star books, that make me not cook, not eat, not clean the house, till the book is done. It was not that kind of book. But it was good enough that I will check into her other books."
3,Sweet Romance,"""Once A Gentleman"" is a sweet regency romance. It is not the kind of book that will stay with you for long time after reading it, but nevertheless; you won't be able to put it down. The hero and the heroine are very sweet and romantic. I strongly recommend this read for any one who wants to enjoy a nice regency romance, without getting to emotionally involve in the plot. If you enjoy reading books that are filled with sexual tension and explicit nudity you can skip this one."
5,Legends of the Goddess is wonderful!,"Legends of the Goddess is enchanting and magical. Laura Powers is poetic and has the voice of an angel. Very unique music. One of the absolute best albums to come along in along time. Take a journey to a time of magic and enchantment, glory and beauty. I strongly recommend this cd. All Laura's work is impressive, an artist in many fields, song writing/singer, painting, check out her web site. Laura Powers is 5 stars in my book, I know you'll like this cd as much as I did."
4,Nice,"Ever since I heard 'Circle of Stone,' I knew I had to get the CD. The vocals are beautiful but the music can sound a bit like pop music at times. The lyrics themselves are wonderful, but 'Morrighan's Quest' paints a vision of a more fluffy goddess than the dark warrior she is. Other than that nitpick, the album is wonderful."
5,Wonderful,"Laura Powers has done a WONDERFUL job. She takes you on an exhilirating journey. From serenity, to energizing, and all points in between. I simply love listening to her music. My favorites are Goddess Of The Hunter Moon, Sisters Of The Wind, and Tir Na Nog. I simply adore almost every single song on the track. Her voice is beautiful all alone, combined with WONDERFUL instruments makes for an amazing CD. I thank her for what she has given to the world."
5,A MOVING MUSICAL JOURNEY,"The music...the voice...the experience of ""Legends of the Goddess"" is transcending! Having read ""Mists of Avalon"" this cd allows me to step back into that magical realm. I haven't enjoyed or been moved by a musical experience like this in a very long time. Thank you!"
4,sing whith your heart,the music is beautiful she has a beautiful voice the instermental part of it is beautiful the only thing that does not compare to enye and lorena is that I think she does not sing with her heart if she were to put her heart into her singing it would compare equally
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"After the first two songs, they all started sounding the same. A little too churchy for my taste. You could have easily replaced any of the Goddess's names she sung with Jesus or God and it would have been straight out of Sunday mass with my grandparents.Not what I was hoping for."
3,Disappointed in quality,"I bought this ink because it was less than half the price of a 'new' cartridge. When I first printed off some color items, however, I was disappointed in the color quality. The thumbnail to credit-card sized images did print in color, but the color was not very vibrant and the printer (HP Deskjet 840C) did not seem to handle the cartridge as well, because there were blank 'stripes' in the pictures where the ink had missed in places. I think next time I will just spend the money for a 'new' cartridge."
3,Good biography and inspirational story of entrepreneurship,"This book is an inspiring story about an entrepreneur that used his strengths to overcome his weakness- dyslexia. It's especially interesting for anyone operating in the investment advisory industry and using Schwab as a custodian. I found it comforting to understand the founder's story and the company's culture. I would recommend this to investors, as well as to the general public."
4,Ex-Schwab employee enjoyed reading it!,As an ex-Schwab employee (1988 - 1996) I really enjoyed reading this book. I worked for or with several of the folks interviewed and was at HQ in San Fran. the day after the earthquake--pretty incredible day! I have recommended it to all of my ex-Schwab buddies.
4,"Despite some trying circumstances, Sonora Poncena came up with a strong album in 1984.","""Agua A La Cadela"", ""El Amor"", ""El Dulcero"" and the self-explanatory ""Esta Es Sonora Poncena"" were this 1984 release's high points. Despite the fact that 1984 was not a particularly good year for Salsa, Papo Lucca and company gave it their all on this album and (along with Tommy Olivencia, Willie Rosario, Oscar D'Leon and Orquesta Mulenze) proved that solid, progressive and REAL Salsa had a loyal and faithful audience. Enjoy!"
3,Gregory Peck Collection,A great way to get well known movies & some others not sow well know.You see new movies to you. It's great.
5,Gregory Peck at his best,"Here is a splendid DVD package of some of Gregory Peck's famous movies such as: ""to kill a mockingbird"" and an extra and rare documentary feature: ""a conversation with Gregory Peck"", where we can see the legendary actor in his intimacy, with his family, his friends and through the late conferences he made in the USA about his career, movies and the american cinema. A wonderful must for his fans and filmgoers all over the world!"
4,Great collection,"A group of Gregory Peck's classic all time movies, worth the money all the way!The Gregory Peck Film Collection should be in everyone's collection."
5,a great collection,We have been wanting the movies Arabesque and The World In His Arms starring Gregory Peck for some time. They are both in this collection along with To Kill a Mockingbird and some other of Gregory Peck's films we are less familiar with. Each film is packaged individually and the quality is good. We are very happy with this purchase.
4,Essential,"Since 'Indexing and Abstracting in Theory and Practice' was a required text for my Subject Analysis course, I expected Lancaster's book to be involved and informative... and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Not only does he provide analysis of indexing and abstracting theories, but he includes specific guidelines and examples for a variety of techniques. Most reviews concern earlier editions, but the third edition has only slight changes (addition of chapters concerning indexing/abstracting in context of advancing technology)."
1,quebecois?,"Well, I can't say much about the choice of vocabulary, but I bought Quebecois and not French, and I received something that differed from a short French dictionary only in some Canadianisms. What about the pronunciation? Please do correct me, but isn't oi in Quebec waw, not wah/war. What about palatalization of t (so that moitie is not mou-a-ti-e but rather mou-o-tsi)."
1,Dilip Hiro: Just another conspiracy nut.,"This is the same idiot author who predicted coaltion forces(read US & UK)would be decimated once stopped at the ""Saddam Line during Gulf War I. On CNN he insisted the overwhelming Iraqi Army artillery would would pummel forces trapped behind Saddam's ""Maginot Line"". It's beyond me why people take this crackpot seriously. Take whatever this author posits with a grain of salt. By the way, if American power is declining in the Middle East, why did Libya shipped 500 tons of nuclear bomb making technolgy to the United states three weekends ago."
3,Tastes great going down but it's a bit heavy,"I have tried all the flavors by Bear Naked and I admit they do taste terrific. I'm not too fond of the Banana cereal but the rest are pretty good. The granola is done just right...not too hard, not sweet at all, and nice and chunky!My only gripe is that after it goes down, it lays very heavily on my stomach causing a terrible heartburn that lingers for hours. I thought it was just my body but my son has been eating it too and just this morning he asked me if it makes me feel sick. I said ""not sick, but I do have indigestion."" He said that must be what he is feeling.We both say it tastes great but I think it's good to use just a few tablespoons at a time, like just add it to yogurt, not to eat as a bowl of cereal. It's just too heavy.If it weren't for that awful feeling afterwards, I would definitely have given this product five stars based on taste and excellent granola-type consistency."
5,Great,This is awesome granola. Great taste and texture. Highly recommend it to anyone. The extra protein is also a big plus.
1,Just awful!,"Tastes vary, I know, but I got this stuff at Target for my wife to use in her yogurt. I was thinking that it would be a nice surprise since we were out of her preferred brand. She tried a little handful and politely said that the brand we usually get was better. I just thought that she was being really picky until I, not wanting it to go to waste, tried some myself. Dude! This is the worst granola that I've EVER tasted. Not exaggerating! Truly awful with a weird aftertaste. I'm a really cheap/frugal guy and I just tossed it out!"
4,Good Equipment,I liked this product very much. It is all that it is claimed to be. A good choice money-wise also.
1,Stale,I have tried this granola localy and loved it. I saw the low price on Amazon a while back and bought a case. The stuff I got in the mail didnt taste at all like the granola I bought in the stores. It tasted like rancid powdered milk. After a mouthful I havent been able to eat This brand of granola again.
2,It's different now.,I don't think it's my imagination or just two bad bags; Peak Protein has been changed. I bought 2 bags from 2 different stores and there was almost no fruit in the granola. My daughter has always wanted the cranberries from my granola because they were better than ones I could buy separately. First the cranberries changed to not as good quality and then in the bags I bought around June or July the fruit almost entirely disappeared. There were about 6 cranberries in the entire bag!I miss the real Peak Protein. No other granola for sale is as good. I've started making my own granola because I wanted something as good as Peak Protein used to be. Turns out it's not that hard -- not to mention far less expensive.
2,"Too much reading, not enough detail",I bough this book for detailing reference. It explains a lot of fundamental concept on detailing but the detail collection in the book is very limited and too simple. The text is very big and the information provided is too little. It might be a good educational book but its defiantly not the book to go to when you need a quick detail for a project.
5,Strong On Defense by Sanford Strong,"As a former police officer & security consultantI can tell you that Sanford's book is right on the money. I hope no one who reads it will ever have to use the information contained therein, but if you do I guarantee it can save your life. This book is a MUST to buy."
5,Strong on preparation,"I've been a security and risk consultant for over 20 years and continue to study martial arts and self-defence. I have developed and delivered self-defence, personal protection and travel safety courses for individuals, government and corporate sector and I continue to highly recommend this book to all and sundry. Being able to punch and kick is not the answer. These sort of skills might be useful if you practice regularly but the best option is not to be in that situation in the first place. If you do find yourself in trouble, it will more often than not be the mental aspects and preparation that will get you through.Stong on Defense includes many of the areas that some so-called self defence books and courses gloss over - the psychological aspects of preparation and above all avoidance. His thinking on preparedness and developing plans BEFORE you get into trouble are spot on. Definitely one of the better books in this area and a must-read for everyone."
5,Serious thoughts about personal safety,"I've read many books on different approaches to self-defense, but this one impressed me because of its focus on mental preparedness. The no-nonsense, ""this is what you are going to experience"" orientation is very sobering, and the case studies, with the after-the-fact analyses, were enlightening. This book could well change your life. Your physical conditioning, size, skill with weapons or fighting style pale to the importance of your mind set. Please do yourself a favor and read this book."
5,MUST READ,"If you have a family, and you want to protect them, but don't know how...this is the book for you. This book is an easy read in terms of syntax, but this book doesn't hold back. Strong has a hard-line approach to how he presents his self-defense strategies. He doesn't try to sugar coat his information, he explains and retells stories as they are, with graphic detail. If you only get one book on defense in you life, this is the one to get."
5,There's no other book that can even compare with this,"This is the best self-defense book that I have come across. I don't think there's another book that is even comparable, maybe Massad's ""In the gravest extreme"".When I got older, I got interested in many areas such as financial security etc. This book is the best on physical security and safety that everybody should read, especially those who have a family.I did read about 5 times."
3,"Good, but not great.","It was pretty good, but some of the songs got to be a little repetitious. Also, there are two different lead vocalists in this band, with very different voices. On almost every song, they alternate between one and the other. I think that was distracting for me...just as I was getting comfortable with one voice, they switched to the other guy's voice. I'd like to hear a few more of their songs be just one guy the whole way through. My favorite song was 1000 Miles Apart.I think alot of people would find this band to be very appealing. I liked it, but it's not my favorite CD by a long-shot."
5,The best album yet from an amazing band!!,"This CD is a MUST HAVE for the collection of any Christian music fan! From the opening track, ""The More"" to the close of the album, every song is worth multiple listens. You'll find yourself singing along with ""A Better Way,"" an instant classic, encouraged by the message of ""Little Is Much,"" and singing with the angels on ""Unbelievable."" ""The Real Jesus"" is a unique and refreshing look at who Jesus is compared to how the world sees Him. Down Here combines an amazing talent for writing music with a gift for penning lyrics that can touch you deep down. The blend of guitars, piano, and fantastic vocals make this album one you'll surely keep in your CD player. This CD comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...buy one for a friend, too!"
4,Real Love Overcomes All,This movie probably didn't get a bunch of stars because it shows a man being faithful. This movie provides us with a look at a relationship when lack of trust gets in the way. We see in this movie a Kent (Jason Weaver) who is not surrounded by temptation but is sent temptation (Mandy played by Caryn Ward) . The movie did a good job of showing us that not all of us are the same. I like how the movie let Kent's friend (played by Carl Payne) be the friend who always keeps it real with his homeboy. The movie kept it real and showed that Kent came very close to loosing to temptation. Kent's girlfriend (Gabrielle Dennis) must work on getting her man back. The movie reminds us that we all make mistakes but without forgiving relationships don't work. You should buy this movie for your collection.
3,He's Mine Not Yours,"This movie offers a good story and has it's moments. Not the type of movie you would rush out to the theater to see. I enjoyed it, but it will be a while before I see it again."
4,Good Movie,I like black films! This was pretty good! I recommend this to anyone! The actors did a great job playing their roles!
5,Mines not yours,The message was great as well as the play. A good play to add to your collection and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
2,Garbage,The acting in this was ridiculously weak. I could have done better and have never acted or done drama a day in my life. I would give this movie away. I DON'T recommend purchasing this movie.
4,Good Test to any Relationship!,"This movie was a true test of LOVE! Just how far would you go, for the man you love and is he STRONG enough????? Must see for couples!"
4,Jason Weaver a +++++,"This was a interesting tale of how a good relationship can be put in danager without trust. I enjoyed the movie, but the plot wasn't very honest, but thats what movies are for; fairy tale endings. However, I was very happy to see Jason Weaver in something again, I belive he's a good actor and is often times forgotten about. I hope to see him a little more in some of these independent productions. Keep the tells coming."
5,playing with fire,"This was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone, especially cocky women that don't think they men won't cheat. However, if y got a good man don't test him bc you might just push into another womans hands!!!"
2,Disappointed,"The glasses look good but once you handle them you realise that they do not have the crisp, solid dependable feeling of craftsmanship that has been the hallmark of Waterford for so many years. These glasses were made in Slovenia, and Waterford Glass should hang its head in shame, passing these products off as coming from that city whose worldwide reputation was largely made on the basis of its wonderful glassmaking tradition. So if you want to buy some genuine Waterford glass, you'll have to take a trip to the city of Waterford."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MODELS STATED!!,"I have the Ericsson 280 cellular web phone, and this does NOT fit, even though the description says it fits ""2xx"" models"
5,Children will love this book. It is great fun.,"My children and I enjoyed answering the mind twirling questions. We've read this book on rainy days, when friends come over and sometimes during school. All children will love this book. It's a great challenge for the children's mind. I truly recommend this book."
2,Disappointing!,I was expecting a new copy of this book but what I got was a yellowed cover disappointment. It was meant as part of a birthday present which was embarrassing for me. Not pleased.
5,Excellent,This music is for someone that loves to dance. The best way to describe it is a little techno with a middle eastern flair! Your body can not stop moving as long as this song is on.
4,A Good Reading,"This is a good reading but it lacks reference to all the sources from which the ideological foundation of Islamic Economic System has been derived. If you are interested in a rational ideological background of Islamic Economics the following two books are also a must read:1. Society and Economics in Islam :Writings and Declarations of Sayyid Mahmud Taleghani by Sayyid Mahmud Taleghani, Prof. Hamid Algar (Editor) (available on amazon)2. Our Economy by Muhammad Baqir As-Sadr"
2,The first two chapters were totally messed up,The first two chapters were totally messed up with running ink all over it. The book itself was good.
1,Cracked on first use,"We've been using slow cookers for years, so we bought this one and kept it ready to use as a spare. This week, we took it out, washed the insert, put some food in it and turned it on. Four hours later the food was cooked but the insert had developed spider cracks, including one through crack.We called Rival and they refused to do anything under warranty since we did not keep the receipt. This even though we had the packaging and this had happened on first use. I found other reports on the internet who bought the same model and developed the same problem on first use, so obviously this is a manufacturing defect. Needless to say, we won't be buying any Rival products / Sunbeam / Jarden products in the future. (Rival and Sunbeam are now owned by Jarden.)"
5,Excelente compra,"Una olla de cocimiento lento excelente, la cocci√≥n al d√≠a siguiente queda en su punto. Una marca que garantiza la calidad. Saludos desde Costa Rica."
4,Love!,"The heating and cold packs are an amazing add on. One can use the packs with (in) the massager or by themselves.I love this as I use it every night to destress. The high setting really loosens muscles and the low is more soothing to me. It is a bit stiff, but I like the durability. It also has a heat setting and slows down when you turn the heat on. The back does not heat up, making me feel safer about using it and it comes with a car charger so you can carry it on long trips. Amazing for the price!"
2,"cute idea, cheap price, iffy execution","I bought this item for my son who has had a lot of dental problems, and does best with an electric toothbrush. The brush does not have the power to stand up to any resistance (even minimal biting stops the motor) and wore out too quickly."
1,This is why not,"This book is really awful. It is basically a long rant in which the author makes unsubstantiated claims and presents his own bizarre opinions as fact. On the plus, it can be good for a laugh."
3,Good for creative ideas,"I own just about all the books from the Pro-Lighting series, and this review covers not only this New Glamour book, but all of them. They are great books for getting new ideas and showing examples of accomplished photographers. They are not heavy on technique and therefore are probably not well suited for beginners. Other than a simple diagram, it does not do a good job of telling the whys and hows of the photographs. All in all, they make good coffe table books."
2,Strangers Waltz-How appropriately titled,"(...)Unlike most incarnations of veteran rock bands, this group does not even sport ONE original member! Gone are David Paton, who at one time was in Elton John's band, still does session bass work, as well as playing on select cuts with the Alan Parsons Project. Gone are drummer Stuart Tosh. The third member, Bill Lyall, succumbed to complications from AIDS several years back. Leaving a whole new lineup that does not even sound remotely like the original one, not musically or in content. Where as PILOT was good seventies pop, this is nothing more than 90's alternative. While it manages to be SOMEWHAT listenable (and I am NOT a fan of alternative) one should not think he/she is getting a 'long overdue' release from this band."
1,Not A Good Feeder,"I purchased a larger version of this at Walmart last year and have tired it in several locations at my office and home. I think it's because of the shape of the feeding holes, but whatever the reason, the birds never eat from it. Other feeders at the same location can be emptied in just a couple of weeks, but this one just remains untouched. Too bad, other than the birds won't eat from it, it's a really nice design and is well made."
3,This is the one.,This is the movie that didn't work. The disks were scratched when I opened them. I will buy them again though. I really want this movie set.
3,Nice video and story,"The story in the video is nice and should teach perseverance. These are the comments on the reviews. However, my daughter of 3 and half soon realized that Madeline was lucky only because she found the prima ballerina willing to help her to take part into the show, despite Madeline made a lot of mistakes during the selection.In fact, the story does not hightlight when and how Madeline is working hard in order to catch up with her companions.Anyway the story is still nice.Another point I want to make is the resemblance with Dora the Explorer. The differences are about context, but the role of a little girl as heroine is quite similar.Dora's VHS contains two episodes (half an hour each), Madeline only one (about half an hour)."
5,Highly entertaining,"I loved this book. It is probably my favorite Robert Olen Butler book. The book is sort of a cross between Camus ""The Stranger"" and Hemmingway's ""A Farewell To Arms."""
1,Very disappointing,"I bought the book because of the interesting description on the back cover and the note that said the author was the ""winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction."" This book was dreadful. Thoroughly unsympathetic characters, terrible dialogue, and an unconvincing plot. Sometimes I laughed out loud at the contrived conflicts and plot twists. I felt I should finish the book just to make sure it was really that bad. It was. Please don't waste your time reading this dud."
5,Motown Mafia,"Another good documentary, i will be trying to release one of my own on my brother soon, randolph ""Big Doc"" Wilson has been in prison 21 years for a crime he didn't commit. FB-""justice for randolph wilson"" & [...]"
5,Parnell at his best!,Even though Back to the Well has been out for a few years I just got around to buying it and I love it. Lee Roy has been a favorite of mine for years and it was so easy to order and get the CD from Amazon.com. I've ordered several products and I've never had one problem. I love it!
3,"Good player, a few quirks though...","Sound quality is great--I've got two beefs with this though:1) The viewing angle on the display is terrible--you cannot see anything if you are too high, too low, or too much at an angle.2) The buttons on the unit are cheap and don't respond well. The remote is OK, but the ones on the unit stink."
3,No Multi Disc Shuffle,I can't believe this 5-disc player cannot be set to shuffle songs from all 5 discs. You can only shuffle songs within one cd. If I would have known this I never would have bought it. What good is it to have a multi-disc player when it can't shuffle between different discs?
2,Leaves a plastic aftertaste in coffee,"Try to find another mug. While it kept coffee warm for about 4 hours, it leaves a plastic aftertaste."
2,Impossible to drink like an adult.,"I will echo what some other have said:The screw open/closed lid is bogus.You are either taking baby sips, or if you tip it up just a little farther liquid is streaming over the sides of your mouth onto your chest.This is the deal breaker for me. I may keep it in my camping gear for times when I don't care too much if I get a splash, but it will not replace my other mug for work as I intended.The insulation properties are not bad, just not really that much better than other travel mugs.Two stars because it does seem sturdy, the insulation works, and it has a lifetime warranty."
1,Impossible to use,"I bought this for my wife to replace the 20 year old plastic travel mug she used for tea. After I used it a few times, I had to apologize to her. The structure of the screw-in lid makes it virtually impossible to get fluid out of it. When it does come, it's a flood. I have frequently burnt my lips because of that. There have been times when I have tipped it up so far that liquid comes out of the vent hole and burns my nose, but I STILL can't get anything to my lips. I regret this purchase. One star ONLY because Amazon won't let me give it a zero."
2,mislead,The book is ok. The picture is very misleading. I was expecting a regular sized book. I would not have bought the book knowing that it was so small. It is hard to read.
3,Adventures on the Wine Tour,"Kermit Lynch is very passionate about wine, and I found the descriptions of the people involved to be quite entertaining, even though not current for the French wine inductry. GrandDoc"
3,Interesting but dated.,Kermit Lynch brings some of France's greatest vintners to life with colorful portraits. His encounters are lively and well written. The crusade against over-processed wine was perhaps revolutionary in 1988 but seems a bit dated now ( not that there is not an abundance of over-processed wine now). Recommended for serious wine enthusiasts.
1,A Waste,"These were cheap and too loose to fit well. Also, there really isn't a bottom so the iPod continually falls out. Most silicon cases you can just stretch and slide the iPod in thru the opening. This one is designed so slide over the top so there isn't a bottom and, like I said, it's too loose anyway. Wouldn't buy again."
5,i thought this book was about Roehm,I got the book by mistake. i thought this book was about Roehm. but it was delivered on time and is in proper condition.
3,"Color not exact for photos, don' last as long as original","Cheap ink cartridges. Don't expect perfect colors for your photos and don't expect to get as many prints as from original Epson cartridges. I was always amazed how long my printer went without changing cartridges, that is until I got these. From very early on you see a marked drop in your ink remaining. Some of my photos of my 4-year old came out a bit green! Overall I'd say buy the black for documents and such, but for color photos use the good stuff."
2,"Great Pic, Lousy Audio","Got a D2011 at BJs. It was packaged in the durned tuff blisterpack like plastic. Had to be real careful to avoid damaging the product getting the packaging open. Takes a relatively long time to ""load"" a disc. Picture looked great but the sound at full was barely above a whisper. Plugged it into TV input jacks to check sound; and there too was very low even with both the D2011 volume control at full and the TV volume at full. Plugged into my sound system, it too had to be up so far that background hum was very loud.Note: Went to Best Buy on line, ordered a Toshiba SD-P1900SN for the same price, picked it up an hour later, and it works great. Screen an inch smaller, and the sound isn't particularly loud, but at least it works well plugged into an external amp and it ""loads"" the disc much quicker. The Audio[non]vox goes back to BJs."
3,Showing Style,Watching DVD's come in nice and so is the sound but I have some professionaly done photo's on CD's and they come up distorted. I'm not pleased about that as I wanted to use them for my business.
2,For the money there are better DVD players.,"I bought this DVD player because Audiovox has a reputable name (compared to brands such as Mustek, Coby, etc.), however, my experience with this unit has brought the Audiovox name down a few notches.Besides having very poor sound quality, I had to return the player because it would pause in the middle of the CD. Then, after a few seconds, it would restart. It did this about 15 times per DVD. As time passed it would not even restart and I would have to reboot the machine. Not good. Though the picture quality is good (not great) the sound quality and the playback problems makes this a machine that you should pass on. For the money range consider the Polaroid or Sony. Happy viewing."
4,Amazon Product Description WARNING,"Amazon's product description incorrectly states that the D2011 is compatible with DVD+R/DVD+RW. According to the owner's manual (can be downloaded from the Audiovox website), the D2011 plays DVD Video and ""most recordable DVDs in the DVD-R format."" If you need to play DVD+R discs, you will probably be out of luck."
1,Does not work in our vehicle,"We bought the D2011 thinking it would be a great thing for our 16 month old, however, it actually frustrates him more than entertains him. We were at first unable to get the DVD player to work in the vehicle. We took it out and set it down on a horizontal place (countertop) and voila, it worked like a charm. When we placed it back in the vehicle (vertical), it would not load up the DVD's we tried to play. We finally figured out that the black angled cloth piece with cardboard? insides was required to be placed on the back of the player in between the back of the player and the seat back. Even when we placed the adjuster? in between the player and the seat back, we still had problems getting the DVD player to load up.On the plus side, when it does decide to play, the picture quality is very nice, and the sound quality is as expected with such small speakers. We're taking ours back and we'll research these type of products more before we buy another one."
4,Nice little machine!,"I originally was going to purchase another brand, but the ""epinions"" were bad. I really wanted the 10"" screen. What I like best about the machine is its simplicity. You just put in a disk and it determines whether it's jpeg, dvd or cd. Movies look good on the screen, too. However, be prepared for a tinny sound. The dvd's are o.k., but the cd's won't break any records for sound quality! But in my research, I found that the greatest complaint on these little, inexpensive machines came from expecting too much of them. For the price, I'm real happy!"
3,beware the space invaders,"""nothing's gonna change"" and ""flashback disco"" are both so so so good that it somehow salvages the rest of the album. the entire 20 minutes of space invader garbage is boring regardless of your japanese abilities. kind of funny, but gets old from the second time you hear it. these guys are very talented and clever, but listening to the whole thing at one time is kind of a drag. but please, do run out and get the ""nothing's gonna change"" single."
4,Good source of info,"This book is a great source of data on the USS San Francisco. It is loaded with facts about the ship, along with numerous photos of the ship under construction and during its career. The factual information seems correct, though the writing style was a little dry. This is a ""Just the facts"" kind of book. Despite its age and the fact that it is a paperback book, the copy I received was in very good condition."
5,Great,So glad i found these in such big bags. This are great and i will be buying them again really soon.
4,Captivating Psychological Suspense,"This novel unfolds its characters and the plot artfully. Celia's own childhood and adult experiences frame the action of the novel. The reader's emotions for Stephen's young daughter will waver between compassion and terror as the truth comes into focus. It is interesting to see the range of reactions different characters have to the situations, based on previous experience with Celia. What is true, what is misdunderstanding, coincidence or deceit? How strongly people can be attached to the vision they hold is one of the more terrifying elements of the book. A suspenseful, intriguing story."
4,Really good but could have been much better,"An excellent reference for the studio photographer. However I feel that the info on each lighting lacks crucial information, such as light ratios. If you have five different light sources it's crucial to know which is the main one and what its intensity is in relation to the others. Since these books are about the lighting and nothing but the lighting, I feel that such details should be in there. It would also be nice to know something more about the darkroom and/or the digital post production of the shots, because the effects in the shots are only partially created by the lighting."
2,GOOD BUT NO CIGAR,This was a good book if you already know alot about lighting. The problem is this that it doesn`t talk about lighting it just shows you examples. Doesn`t say why you put this light here and what effect it has on the film. I do say though it is worth it to add it to your libary if the price is right.
1,I could have come up with something better,This best is great if you want to see other photographers photographs and how they lit there pictures (but not in detial). It does not talk about lighting. It just gives examples. You can learn more doing tests yourself. This is a good book for the price.
5,A Must Listen,This CD was sent to me by a very close friend in Barcelona about ten years ago. I have listened to it probably a thousand times. I will never tire of it. There are songs on here that touch me deeply in my soul. The lyrics are printed out in Spanish. The poetry is beautiful and the music moving. I highly recommend this Clara Montes CD. If you are romantic and passionate you will listen over and over and over again...
5,"Pure flamenco, unplugged","En Un Ratito is an intimate flamenco experience. This series of live recordings could just as easily have been made in someone's kitchen -- no audience, just guitarists, singers, and jaleos (participants who clap the rhythm and speak words of encouragement to the artists). The feeling of intimacy is all the more remarkable since the artists include greats like Potito, Remedios Amaya, Sorderita and Duquende.The pace and groove of the whole album, including the bulerias, is relaxed and smooth. Even when it's soulful and mournful, it's somehow peaceful. Western ears unused to flamenco's mirco-tonal scale should still enjoy the beautiful expression of the singers and the interplay of the guitarists.This album is what puro flamenco is all about."
1,NOT What I Ordered -- Listing is for Textbook -- Workbook was shipped.,"This listing is for the ""Workbook Edition"" of a textbook -- in other words, it is for a textbook that includes a workbook, not JUST the workbook.I received only the workbook.My order was from lowpricebooksetcReading the other reviews, it appears some people have actually received the textbook."
2,Sellers Inflating Book Rating,"I own this book and personally I think the sellers are inflating the rating of this book. It is nowhere near magnificent. It is a good casual read, but I think there could be much better. The layout is confusing and at times inconsistent and incorrect. In fact, the catalog of Scriabin's works at the end of the book is not even complete. I would caution anyone to go to your local library and check out this book first before you spend over $100 for it. I bought it when it was in print and on sale for under $20 and that might even have been too much to spend."
3,Don't put it in the dishwasher,"This ""alternative metal"" can lose its luster completely if it's washed in a dish washer. Silver polish, even fine steel wool, can't bring it back to its original finish."
2,Too short,"If you want to purchase a good video with alot of parrot species in it, grab Parrots, Look Who's Talking. Parrot Adventures is somewhat informative and they only show a small variety of birds in it."
3,Good for carrying around,"The case is good to carry the DS for trips to the store, etc. It is an atractive case. However, it doesn't have any space to carry the games. The extra stylus pens and screen protectors are a good bonus."
2,"NintendoDS 3 In 1 Bundle, Pink","Nintendo DS 3 In 1 Bundle - PinkWorks okay - color was good, casing will keep DS safe from harm. Packing company needs more quality control as the package I received did not have the ""3"" items inside. Never did receive the screen savers."
2,Disappointing Case,"I had expected there would be room to store extra DS games in this case. Had I seen it ""live"" in a store, I never would have bought it."
1,Buyer Beware,I cannot say anything about Stylus or Screen Protector because i never used them after I was so disappointed with carrying case. Case is so small that it requires effort and maneuvering from adults to close the case once DS Lite is inside the case forget about young kids. I am sure if I had allowed my 6 year child to use this case then he would have dropped his game before he would have closed the case. You want to buy a case to protect your game system and not to put at risk. Don't know how much would be hit on margin if the company would have made this case only 1/2 inch bigger than what it is right now.
1,UGH!!! Worst Product Ever,"Screen protectors don't stick, games case bulky and uncomfortable. Worst buy ever. The first sentence is what I wrote in my return claim, this is horrible, flimsy and the worst quality one could ever expect to receive in an item. The only thing that works is the stylus and honestly you can get that anywhere.Beware: DO NOT BUY!"
3,Nice enough case,"The case is nice enough and will do the job. It's not a true pink, more of a red with a thin lined design on it. I really had no need for the stylus, and never did get the screen protectors on. But the case will work for carrying the DS and a 3 game plastic case."
4,A Great Resource for Designing a Dissertation,"If you are writing a dissertation or a major thesis, this is a great and useful resource to refer to again and again. It is simple to read and can help to shape the outline of the major components of a dissertation. Highly recommended for anyone in a graduate program feeling overwhelmed with where to start in developing an outline."
4,help for ABDs,This is a well written book that is helping me to tackle my dissertation one component at a time. It is helpful and has great examples of each part of a dissertation. I shows what goes where for both quant. and qual. approaches. enjoy it and I do believe it will help me reach my goals to finish this project in a reasonable time-frame.
1,What a mess!,"Cheesy dance steps, girls who were obviously chosen for reasons other than fitness, and bad camera angles. His moves are sloppy and I would swear he was making them up as he went along except for the girls seemed to be able to follow him along. Don't waste your money. If you are looking for a truly outstanding dance splashed workout, I would suggest ""DanceWorks"" by Kari Anderson with the Pacific Northwest Ballet."
4,Early Vicki Carr,"Vicki Carr is great whatever she sings. Some of these are favoites of mine, some are not. These are some of the first songs she produced. Her voice became richer and warmer in later years. Why doesn't Colombia re-release ""The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face)"" Album?"
5,the unforgetable VikiCarr,To me she will always be one of the all time greats.Her music never fails to move me.
4,Searched for years,"This was one of my favorite albums in High School but I never owned it so for years I searched for it. By the time I had gotten into it wasn't readily available on LP or Cassette and until recently on CD. Every time I went to a new city I would scour the used record shops and finally found it in Santa Cruz, CA.! I love the Celtic combination with the 70's rock. It sounds great on LP and now I'm psyched to find it on CD..."
4,"Superb With A Capital ""S""","Finally! After years of waiting for the classic albums from this great Irish folk/prog/rock band to appear in non-""impossible to find"" fashion, fans are rewarded with superb (with a capitol ""s"") reissues courtesy Edsel/Demon U.K. Book Of Invasions was a winning release (originally available on DJM Records, then distributed by GRT) filled with winning songs like ""Trouble With A Capital T"", ""The Power And The Glory"" and ""King Of Morning, Queen Of Day"". Excellently played flutes, rock-solid arrangements, hook-filled melodies. It's ""Irish"" alright, but not in the usual way. It reminded me of Jethro Tull only a little bit edgier. Edsel's remastering is excellent!"
2,"It's ok, not for kids who have had other flavored toothpaste","Had my children not experienced other brands and flavors of toothpaste before, they may have taken to this better. It has a bitter taste and doesn't foam up much, which leaves me feeling like not much cleaning occurs. While it is appealing due to the characters, that is really the highlight of this product!"
1,Not too happy,"The product was exactly what it is advertised as...a mini bronze and brown globe. But it arrived broken, and since it was a Christmas gift, I had no idea until my fiance opened it up and found that the stand had snapped in several places. Rather a disappointing present..."
3,"Cute Product, Cheap Material","I received the globe with a couple of pieces broken on it. I didn't return it because its so cute, and because the pieces broken on mine didn't stop it from standing up like it's supposed to. I received mine with a chip missing on the base and a piece that holds it up missing. Other than the careless shipping method that the shipper uses, it's a good product that I would recommend buying, but I would add a buyer beware that you're product may come damaged."
4,A Change Of Pace,"Well, LTJ Bukem is back with his 4th installment of the Earth series. Right off the bat you are in for a total change of pace from the Drum & Bass King. This has much more of a House feel with lots of interesting blends of dance mucic of all kinds. If your a hardcore D&B fan chances are this is not up your ally, but if your open to a nice smooth and fun ride down the fresh dance highway, this is going to be a treat."
2,Interesting but slow moving and boring,"It's always quite interesting to know about the East, its traditions, ways of living and philosophy. Unfortunately, this movie does not seem to care much about the viewer's patience: to watch the experiences of a young guy in the world of pottery for two hours seems to be too much. The story goes about a young canadian fellow who - after his father's death which affected him to the point of attempted suicide - goes to Japan to visit an uncle with the hope to recover from his depression. There, he starts working with his japanese uncle in pottering. And that's about it. From then on, the movie drags eternally. Probably, there's a great deal of profound ideas in the movie, but I did not get any since I was so bored that - to be honest - I almost fell asleep. Two stars for the photography, the locations and Tatsuya Fuji(the uncle), the same actor from EMPIRE OF THE SENSES and IN THE REALM OF PASSION."
2,Good kiln shots,"Kamataki has a ""Karate Kid does pottery"" feel to it. For those who are interested it is worth watching for the scenery and some good kiln firing video. But, the story is not particularly believable. It goes beyond the Karate Kid only in showing how (supposedly) Japanese ideas about sex as well those about bonsai, karate, or pottery (in this case) can save the despondent western individual."
2,A Big Disappointment--,"I thought that perhaps I could learn a few words in Gujarati, so a book aimed at children seemed ideal. However, the classical music that runs throughout the DVD is too loud and drowns out the voice of the person saying the words. Although each word is repeated, I found it difficult to pick up the correct pronunciation."
5,excellent - a great buy,"My son loves this and will watch it over and over again. Basic, but a good start to the language, good repetition, although I had to look up some of the words on the internet to understand what was being said. A list of the words so you could compare the sound with how it looks would be helpful, but I can already count to ten, name my colours, animals and a range of helpful words"
3,"works, but stinks plenty on it's own","each unit lasts about a month and if you use it correctly it does work the way it's suppose to, but it sure stinks. I don't know what they put on it for a deodorizer, but it's awful."
2,Product is fine but it took a long time to receive the product,"It took almost a month to receive the product.If you are not in hurry, it is OK but if you are in hurry, consider other way of purchasing this product via amazon."
1,Ti is not Heavy Duty,It is not Heavy Duty like they say It is a dollar store Item . The picture is a lot more bigger than the real .
1,Picture Above Is Not Accurate,"I saw a product similar to this one in Collections, Etc. for $17.99, but I chose to order this one even though it was more, because I liked the way it looked better. I liked the colors and the antique look that this one appeared to have. But when I got it, it looked just like the one in Collections, etc., and was much more cheaply made than I expected. It did not have the antique look that the picture and the description seem to indicate. I was not happy with it so I returned it to them - UPS Ground - because the Farm & Home Supply Center website said they would refund UPS ground shipping on returns. It cost me $14 to return it to them. Then when I provided proof of and requested a refund of my return shipping costs, they sent me an email telling me that they didn't have to refund it to me because the one they sent me ""looks"" like the one on Amazon. If it looked like the picture, I wouldn't have returned it."
4,make you love me,"I really enjoyed this book and am feelin the author also, keep doing your thing girl."
4,"Drama, Drama, Drama","Good read. It will make you laugh, cry and want to kick butt. The drama does not stop. I could not put it down. With each page, you want to know what else could possibly happen next. Can't wait for the next book."
3,Good Read,"Tate Gibson is a true player and trying to juggle three women at the same time almost was his undoing. One of his ""ladies"" LeQuisha at first seemed to be willing to play herself just for the love of someone not worthy but in the end she seemed to grow up and really be a good person. Tangie Tate's other girl was young minded and at times just seemed to be annoying. Carmela was never truly a factor and I wonder why the author's synopsis ever really gave her any mention. This book was just ok it had no real WOW! factor or held any real special meaning. I mean the premise of player vs too many women has been done before many many times. The unfortunate death of LeQuisha's sister was a bit surprising but way unnecessary and I felt the author just threw that in for no apparent reason it didn't make the characters any more or less stronger. The sudden antics of LeQuisha's daughter was a trip and that might have been the best part. This book was just ok but still recommended."
4,Not Bad!,I enjoyed reading Make You Love Me. Lots of drama! This was the first time I was introduced to this author. I am looking forward to the sequel or the next book (Messin Up). I was surprised at how Tate ended up in the end. Lots of drama!
2,Disappointing product,"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old for Christmas- with so many complaints on the tires slipping you would think power wheels would try something different, like one ruber strip or something. I have pushed this riding toy more than it has gone on its own. Also, for the size and voltage of this vehicle 5mph is really too slow, there should be some way to adjust it. Sorry to be so negative, just hate to see so much money wasted. I am going to try the bands so I'll write again."
3,cheaply made product for the money,"I love fisher price and I love Power Wheels, but with this product they have really disappointed me. My son got a Fisher Price Ninja when he was 2 and rode it for 2 1/2 years without problems. It was time to get him a new one since the Ninja was worn out. Now 4 1/2 years old we got the Adventure for Christmas, now three months later the forward reverse button has come off without the help of a Boy(which sometimes happens) but it will not go back on. Without that switch his three month old Adventure now is useless to me. My husband has tried to rig it some way so he can ride. My son is so disappointed , it hurts me. For such a great idea for a toy for a child, you would think that Fisher Price would have put forth a little more effort with the parts. Sorry Fisher Price but this WILL BE the last power wheel I buy."
4,Beautiful book!,"The illustrations in this book of poetry are wonderful! And many of the poems are beautiful with imagery and lyrical qualities that young and older children can enjoy. There are a few shorter verses that interrupt the flow (and don't really say much), but some of the longer poems are beautiful and well worth the purchase of this volume. The artwork vividly captures the feel and imagery of each poem and add to this lovely book! My four-year-old and I enjoy reading some of the poems together."
2,poor and uneven qaulity,"Very think chews, cut unevenly, many with holes like swiss cheese. Not appropriate for use unless you cull through the bag removing the discards."
2,Poor quality print,"Poor quality printing on some pages - not legible- pages missing - pages not numbered- I understand that it is a re-print from the oriuginal, but the print was not legible on many pages - some pages were blank or very blurry - I emailed the seller - did not hear back - $27.00 is a lot of money for such poor quality - I am very unhappy with this purchase!"
5,Very Nice Addition To The Clamp Rack..but,"These are fantastic little clamps. I use them in almost all my glue-ups. They are not a replacement for the the clamping power of the ""traditional"" bessey parallel clamp, but boy they are easy to use and convenient.For example, I use these clamps for a board glue-up on the sides of the joint to keep the boards aligned top to bottom while my k-bodies apply the joint pressure. These clamps compliment right angle jigs very well. I got 8 of them now and I am thinking about the 12"". I wish they had the 12"" in this 4 pack package. It seems like a good value.Update 4/07 - I have had two of these clamps fail...they start slipping immediately after putting on pressure...they are still nice overall...but i would look for alternatives given the cost"
3,"Easy to use, but lacks on clamping pressure.","This is a decent clamp for holding things temporarily, and as effective as the inexpensive $5 plastic ones I bought at a liquidation place. Bessey makes an all metal version of this that has amazing clamping pressure, but these aren't them. You get 4 Bessey Kliks for the same price of one of the all metal ones, and they have about 1/4 the pressure, so it comes down to you get what you pay for."
2,roomy bag but it has zipper problems,"I bought this bag for myself and loved it, it's roomy and fit everything that i could have possibly fit in to it, but the zipper broke on it 3 days after using it."
2,"Nice in Shape, but not in colour","Nice in shape, but apart from Black, the rest looks too mature. I bought one in Khaki colour, it suite my mom better."
2,PCMCIA TV Tuner for Notebook,"When i see, look good, but i used with battery and not work properly. Only conected by AC work good. I recomend if not use the battery."
1,take care friends,"1. the image is poor--and i mean, very poor. i run the output into an 18inch viewsonic lcd monitor, and the result, whenever you exceed the smallest viewing box, is laughable. i use this monitor to view my dvds because of it's picture quality, so...2. and this is the biggie: your processor will run at 100% of output capacity when the unit is operating--with all that that means, possible damage to and/or shortened life of the processor due to extended periods of operation, heating issues, degraded multitasking, etc., etc.why the software does not permit hardware acceleration, i have no idea. so, buy at your own risk--and the risk of your cpu."
1,Decent Card..Just didn't work on our laptop,TV tuner card was sent and received as stated by the seller. The TV card however did not work on our laptop (IBM Thinkpad A41p) but worked just fine in a laptop of a different manufacturer. Had to use AVerMedia website to get resolution of problem but gave up when we realized the process was going to take forever. Sold it to person who got it to work on their laptop and we just bought a LCD TV.
2,Problems,"Well I received it and I proceed to install following the instructions. Really very easy to install. I connected AverTV Cardbus to the cable. I did a SCAN for the cable channels, it worked for a while and then the blue light of the card turned off and no channels could be see. I removed the AverTV Cardbus from my notebook and blue light came back again for maybe 1 min or less and turned off again.It looks that it is maybe damage, I think the problem appears when it gets hot. I made work the following day and it worked for maybe 5 min. and card light goes off again.Maybe I received one that has problems"
1,"Caution, Avoid this product","At first I thought this will be useful, a tv turner card without cables. Then I installed and it work fine for 3 minutes then it frozed. I restarted my computer, I unistalled and installed again. 30 minutes later frozed up againd. Download newest drivers, and the same procedure. 1 hour later froze up.I Packed it up and send it on a heart beat.stay away from avermedia."
3,Problems,"I attempted to install this card into my Dell 600m. The computer crashed everytime the card was plugged in, but the computer was fine when it was started without the card. I was never able to properly install. Just a heads up, I am unsure about the quality of this product, I just know about hte compatability."
4,still makes a great chicken,"My pan peeled also but that didn't stop me from using it. It makes a great crispy/juicy chicken and I never prepare one any other way now. Stick the chicken on the pan, put your favorite rub on the outside and put it in the oven - delicious!"
3,Doesn't look like picture,"Received condo and was quite surprised....it was neon Pink! Does not look at all like picture. Handle is useless as it does not stay on. The bottom looked like it was solid and high enough to put some sand down, but it is not and your substrate will leak out through the wire a bit. They added a ribbon around the bottom that says ""my hermit crab condo"". I put ""Crusty"" in a few hours in the evenings and he does love climbing around and around in it. The first night he climbed for 4 hours straight! Overall, product does do what I intended it for...just some excercise time and price was reasonable."
4,The finishing touch!,"Great quality along with the rest of the Sea Life collection. The perfect wall accent to make my son's room the best in the house! The only small complaint is that there isn't an easy way to hang these up, I had to rig something where I looped a thin ribbon and stapled it to the tag on the back in order to hang them."
5,Adorable decoration & easy to hang up,"These decorations are adorable for the room and since they are made so light you can get from 3M velcro stickers that you stick to your wall and when you want to remove it, it won't chip the paint. It only requires one velcro. And they go so well with the crib set as well. We just love our nursery and this really added to it."
1,Great for the 1950's,"I started using this dictionary believing it to be a simple and straightforward way of learning some simple words in Romanian.However, having learned a number of nouns I then discovered that many of them were old words, no longer used. If you want to learn Romanian that most Romanians will understand then don't use this book.Nu bine!"
5,K'NAAN,this is some really good stuff. i found out about this when i went to see mos def and talib kweli in concert and it really blew my mind its really good music. k'naan is some good honest music that shouldn't be missed i highly recomend trying to get a hold of this album.
2,Not as expected.,This item is all packaging. The video was awful and cheaply made. I was very disappointed.
4,biblical parody for bitter assholes,"Jason Rogers has written a book that is intelligent, bizarre, hilarious, and consistently self-deprecating. It's parodic and experimental nature allows his ideas and (pseudo)-philosophies to be interjected at his leisure. This is the only book I've read by Jason Rogers, but the writing itself seems to be caricatural in a certain sense, but is also a satirical revision of the 'feeling' of a religious text. The writing has numerous references to itself, the author, and popular culture (among other things), adding to the absurdness of the overall story and mood. My only complaint is that the last part of the book is written in what may or may not be binary code, but even that adds to the overall ludicrousness, which seemed to me to be the main point, religion is irrational and grotesque.Ultimately, anyone who enjoys avant garde fiction and peculiar humour will want to check this out."
2,Religious angst and its effects.,"This book is one that I read with an open mind and being a Christian I knew it would be challenging. This book however, did not make me think differently or in new and enlightend ways. The book is a mock religious text written from the point of view of Ready Freddy and in all his drunken stupor he fills his diciples with philosophy. The author had a really good concept and a great character in Ready Freddy but he let his own religious angst get in the way of what could have been a finally tuned concept. The book also contains 50 pages of binary coding which looks cool but it is frustrating to the reader. This book is very much written in the same style as Elitist was so if experimental writing is your thing, dive in, if not, try Dan Brown:)"
5,"If you like Purdy, you'll love this!","Bill Hartston is not only a strong chess player, he's also a smart and erudite writer. This book is a gem, and is perfect for the kinds of players who admire the writings of C.J.S.Purdy for their practical wisdom. This book has that wisdom, and its format makes it easy, and a delight, to use. Hartston positively encourages the reader to dip into it in any order, although it's also designed to be worked through as a course; it's a goldmine of ideas and advice that's also fun browsing."
5,Finest subtle techno from France,"Amazing debut album by this french artist on the mike ink's label KOMPAKT in Cologne. Over 60mn of a post basic channel journey and also a post minimal k√∂lner style way. Jonas Bering lives and works in Lille. He convices in crackling dub, fast deep unbelievable elevation, or also club anthem. You can't be a fan of KOMPAKT and CHAIN REACTION and live without the album ""Bienfait"" of Jonas Bering KOMPAKT CD5 KOMPAKT 18"
2,This book Gets old,I couldn't put the book down in the beggining of the book. But at the end I wanted to burn the book. It is very repetitious. I give it a C-
2,Interesting and probably a fake,"Scholars--the vast majority of them--believe this is a hoax.""Maybrick"" makes mistakes referring to landmarks that existed in 1888, the ink strongly suggests that it was written recently.In a bizarre and confusing twist, in January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate affidavits that he was in fact ""the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary."" THEN, adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation.What to make of Barrett's double-take? One can only wonder.I am no scholar, yet I tend to believe them over non-scholars (such as myself).It's still an interesting ""book"" for it shows the remarkable interests that Jack the Ripper generates after over a century."
2,"Not great, but ok","Maybrick has been one of the more contentious suspects, as the diary's authenticity is hotly debated. I am of the opinion that the diary is not authentic (even based on the handwriting alone, compared to the will), but this book is the main work representing the 'pro' camp. If that is what one wants, then the book is worth it."
4,Wonderful book that keeps anyones attention,"This book keep me reading the diary was so real and made it seem like you kept the discovery of Jack the Ripper in your hands. The only negitive thing was the debating in the book about the materials of solving the case (i.e. the watch, and the discription of the murder scenes). But overall the book was informational and a really good novel."
1,Beware The Hoax!!!,"If the word is not yet out, readers should beware that this book is a hoax, confirmed by none other than Mike Barrett himself. Barrett has admitted that he and his wife Anne hatched the scheme out of a genuine need for money. Of course Shirley Harrison, who provided the narrative, and the publishers agent deny Barrett's claims, and appear to be without guilt. There is a web site (do a Ripper search and you'll stumble upon it) that has an open letter by Mike Barrett detailing the whole sordid affair."
3,Mystery Without End,"It's said that most murders are solved in the first 48 hours, or not at all. How many murders are solved after 123 years? None, of course--but that doesn't mean that a chilling new take on the facts regarding a classic can't be fun. The diary of Maybrick, even if its a hoax, is a good one, filled with the obligatory shudders and goosebumps--and the analysis of that ""journal"" lends it just the right touch of credence. It doesn't have to be real to be scary, just a little bit believable when it's late at night and no one else is home.The Burn Farm"
4,THE STORY WONT GO AWAY,"This is the first of three books avaiable which deal specifically with the Diary of Jack the Ripper. Although it is not the best-written book, and could have been shorter without losing impact, it presents a credible case for the diary as being that of both James Maybrcik and JTR.Although criticized by many ripperologists as a hoax, as fiction, as being ""too good to be true,"" the most striking thing, in my opinion, is that no one has come up with any definitive proof that either the diary is fake, or that Maybrick could not have been JTR. Granted, it's not enough to be unable to prove a negative, but when you pile on all the circumstantial evidence provided by this and the two subsequent books that Maybrick and JTR are one and the same, it remains very interesting.I would have given it 5 stars for content, but style is lacking."
3,"Great carrier, poor customer service","The carrier is great. No complaints about it. Evenflo, however, leaves something to be desired: we broke the front side-release buckle on the carrier by closing a car door on it. Completely our fault. I contacted Evenflo about a replacement buckle, saying that it was my fault and that I would pay for the replacement and shipping for the buckle. They told me that they do not offer replacement buckles and suggested that I stop using the carrier. Looking around online, I found a replacement buckle for $1.00 CAD. I'm not sure what kind of company recommends throwing away a $120 CAD product because a $1.00 CAD part is broken, but such a suggestion is in my opinion inexcusable. Although they make great products, in the future I won't be using products that are apparently disposable if the tiniest part breaks."
3,Not a wonderful back pack,"I found this to be very uncomfortable. It feels like something hard is pressing against your back - although it may be that I have adjusted it incorrectly - I did follow the instructions. This back pack looks great and has all the bells and whistles, but the weight of the baby (mine 22 lbs) combined with the weight of the back pack just doesn't seem to be distributed very well."
4,Nice Carrier,"We bought this carrier last months, used it several times and like it. My 11-month daughter likes riding it when we take her on hiking trips. There is a lot of storage space to carry snacks and water for all of us! My daughter is 20lbs now and we can use it until she is 40lbs according to the product description. The straps can be a little more padded and it's heavier b/c of the extra storage and the canopy. But we like it so far and I would recommend it."
4,Great Backpack with lots of storage,"My husband who is 6' has no problems carrying our 1 yr old around in it, but I am 5'2"" and it hurts my shoulders to carry around a 20lb kid for too long. The storage on the carrier is great however and holds everything we might need for a hike. Material seems sturdy. Great color. Son likes to ride in it and actually falls asleep in it sometimes."
1,Poorly Constructed,"My husband and I were so excited to receive this item as a gift, since we live in VT and hike all the time. However, after a few months of use, the straps began to tear away from the pack. The nylon was actually ripped to shreds -- at 1 year my son weighs 22lbs. We can no longer use it. We called Evenflo and were informed that there was a 90 day warranty and that there was nothing more they can do for us. Needless to say, we are extremely disapointed with the durability of this product and the customer service of Evenflo. We will never use another Evenflo product again and we encourage you not to but this product."
1,Terrible Product,"My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born. He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time. Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds. It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone. The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!! I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!! I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this!!"
3,good for an afternoon but.....,"This backpack is fine for a walk in the park but if you intend to do any serious hiking for an afternoon I wouldn't recommend it. First problem that we found with it is that it was difficult to put on once our 1 yr old was in it, (he weighs 25 lbs). The next problem was that after hiking for about an hour the straps cut into our shoulders. There is NOT enough padding if you will be wearing it for an afternoon of hiking. My husband also had a problem with pain in the middle uppper part of his back after wearing this backpack.I would have to say that if you are planning on doing more than an occaional walk in the park, spend the money and get a Kelty or a Tough Traveler. I recently bought a Kelty Ridgeline and it is worth the extra money. A friend of mine has the tough Traveller Stallion and she loves it.On the plus side this backpack has great storage with the fanny pack (good for sippy cups or camera) and a great storage area in the back."
4,Yaaaayyyy! Kinky discover what a plot is again!,"Read the Kirkus Review for the story summary, so I'll cut to the chase here. Kinky tells a lot of road stories about Willie Nelson, Tom T. Hall (""loved all his songs and both his melodies"") and offers a ribald quote from Kris Kristofferson about Farrah Fawcett-Majors that will make you spit milk through your nose. These stories make ""Roadkill"" a far more entertaining book than ""The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover"" in which he seemed to spend far too much time talking about himself. Kinky is capable of spinning a mystery plot -- ""A Case of Lone Star"" is still his best -- but ""Roadkill"" shows Kinky can be ribaldly funny, still capable of making the inner 13-year-old boy on some of us laugh out loud"
3,Kinky with a Country Twist,"In this latest foray into the world of amateur detection, erstwhile country singer (and later Texas politician), Kinky Friedman takes an oddly new twisting road. Again the author plays the starring role in a mystery.Waking up to find himself halfway to crazy-ville, Kinky has a discussion with a gypsy in the bathroom mirror that leads his friends to send him on a sabbatical trip with long-time friend Willie Nelson on the Honeysuckle Rose (Willie's tour bus). The trip, while restoring some of Friedman's sanity (if indeed there is any) drops a new case in our sleuth's lap--one involving Indians (of the Native American variety), roadies, curses, and pot-shots.In the end, Friedman and friends find themselves investigating age-old Indian legends and Willie's ex-wives.Kinky is his usual irreverent self in reporting this tale of music-world travel and murder. If you're a fan, you'll still be one. Three out of five reading glasses.--Benjamin Potter, February 27, 2011"
3,Still Chuckling,My 1st ride on the Friedman bandwagon. Hope the next one is as much fun. I'm now looking for a puppethead for my refrigerator. (Too bad we live in a world with more rules than common sense. The system won't let me use the auther's first name in the review)
5,Kinky serves heapin' heppin's of Texas humor in Roadkill.,"As prosaic and poetic as Gerard Manley Hopkins on a steady diet of Shiner(with apologies to said poet), Kinky Friedman, in a thoughtful and classically burlesque manner, serves up a heapin' heppin' of Texas humor in Roadkill, his newest novel featuring ""Old Blue Eyes Crying In the Rain"" Willie Nelson as the monsieur in distress. Don't miss it!"
5,Kinky is a fine author and a great songwritter!!,"Ihave been a fan of Kinky's music for over twenty years. The good news is this book is as entertaining as his music. The bad nrews is all of his energy is expended on his detective novels, he no longer writes those great songs"
5,Fluid Master 8100 Flush 'N' Sparkle Toilet Bowl Cleaning System,I like the product and the blue color. Why don';t the replacement elements last as long as the one's that come with the whole unit?
2,Disappointed,"Does not work as well as I had expected, still have the scaly water line. Sometimes the water is a very deep blue, other times you can hardly bsee any blue. Not consistent delivery of cleaner."
1,NEW TOILET HAS BLUE STAIN,This product not only turns your toilet water an ugly blue but has now stained my brand new toilet with a blue ring that I cannot even bleach off. I've had it installed for about two months and it is not keeping the bowl clean either.
4,Tricky to Install but Works Well,"I bought the Septic Tank Care with BioBalance (8200) b/c we have a septic system and do not use bleach. The illustrations are simpler than our Kohler tank mechanism, but we figured out how to adjust it, and it seems to work quite well on every single flush. I think the instructions are too simplistic and should show at least one other type of system so people make sure they install it correctly. As to how long it lasts, well the box says 'up to 3 months' which could mean a week to 3 months--who knows. I do think it's over priced at $14 (Lowes) and refills at $8. So I'm only giving it 4 stars."
2,Not good enough,"I'm a long user of Clorox bleach tablets, but in one of my toilets it kept getting stuck under the seal causing the toilet to run until the tablet was moved.I bought this hoping to prevent the red waterline rings that are common from my water supply. First of all I got blue instead of bleach which I would have known if I had read more reviews or the description more closely. Second the blue doesn't work at all. I never had red rings with the clorox tablets, but the blue flush n sparkle does NOTHING for it. I still have to clean the toilet weekly to get rid of the ring...just as if I had nothing in the toilet.I bought 4 of these and 1 wouldn't work with 1 of the toilets (which is, ironically, also fluidmaster) so I continue to use Clorox in that one.I like the fact that this isn't mucking up the stuff in the toilet basin, but it isn't keeping the bowl clean either."
5,It is my third,"I purchased my first copy of this book about 15 years ago. It is easy to use and read. There are no pictures, it is strictly a written description of herbal properties. Though I would not consider it the most detailed as far as describing all the properties of herb but I would say it gives a good overveiw. At one point I decided I could forgo my copy and gave it away, in six months I had bought another copy. This time I am upgrading to a spiral edition for ease in use as my second copy is falling apart after 7 years. It has a section that has common herbal combinations and if you are familar with NSP the ingredients match the combinations sold by the company. It also has a small section of Chinese herbs and combinations."
3,"The Little Herb Encyclopedia...okay, not the greatest.","There are many herbs not in the book. Explanations are a bit on the hazy side. No ideas on how to use the herbs...BUT...it's great for what it does have, tells of many things each herb can be used for. Just wish it were more complete!With all this, I still have had no thought of returning the one I bought for myself at the store. Bought one from Amazon for a friend who works much with herbs, etc., as she said it was on her wish list.p.s...get the spiral bound one...much easier to use."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I have had the Tivoli table radio for some time when I decided to buy the Boston Acoustics Receptor radio for my country house. I bought the refurbished unit to save some money, hoping it would be acceptable. WOW, Was I shocked! The radio is indistingushable from brand new and the performance blows away the Tivoli. It has got to be the BEST bass performance of any table radio on the market along with outstanding tuner reception.A BEST BUY!"
5,Look foward to waking up,"Very pleased, very easy to set, battery back up workedperfect during a recent black out, has a sweet large sound and pulls in a strong signal. And no it is not too bright,in night mode it has good low level lighting."
5,Just right,"Delivered in absolutely like new condition.Station preset feature allows almost instant station selection, maybe even faster than push-button, because you don't need to remember which button (I also have a push-button radio).Great reception, sound, size and all the alarm features I need for a bedside table."
4,Good for what it's worth,If you are looking for THICK plastic this is not it. But it was a great price and will work. No complaints
1,"Bride, left at the alter","I ordered two of these based on their good reviews. Both arrived before I took off for a trip, but neither had seat straps to hold the covers to the seat base. I called the company listed on the package and got little help other than ""return for refund."" Amazon said the same, but now I won't have for my two-month long trip. Product looks very good except for lack of way to hold it to the seat and that is critical under the best of circumstances. Too bad, it could have been nice!"
4,sheepskin,"I'm useing this cover on my bed-much better price than the ones made for a bed cover--It is pieced,some pieces are softer than others. The overall coloring is sort of a marbled effect,rather pretty to me. I'm going to get another soon to use on my power chair,as this is much cheaper than the pads sold on other sites."
4,It's good. Stays put on leather seat.,"I bought initially a thicker, much better quality seatcover ($[...]). However the size was wrong and I ended up sending it back and ordering this one. It sticks to my leather seat, doesn't move and it protects my butt from cold leather seat in the morning. (Unfortunately my seat heater on driver's side went dead and it costs $[...] to fix it. Too much for a '97 Lexus ES300). I think that for the money - this seatcover is good. Would recommend to others."
4,All Natural Cover,Good thickness of sheepskin with a naturally light tan color. Stays put on leather seats and insulates well.
3,sheepskin seat wraps,"recieved two seat wraps, did not match at all.one ivory & long haired,other one yellow & mangy looking. called amazon and they sent me a return slip & another seat wrap.recieved in two days. this one better but did not really match. will live with it. installed them in a 1995, z28, camaro. they fit perfect. dont slide do to rubber backing. real satisfied with all my dealings with amazon.com ... L. MORRISON"
1,completely not matched seat covers,"ordered 2 of them. one is thick, dark yellow, not soft. another is thin, light yellow, very soft. completely unmatched pair. also they are short in length for high back seats: they either cover seat completely, but not headrest, or only 80% of seat."
2,Doesn't stay in place!,"This is a very nice and well made seat cover, but it will not stay in place. Additional attaching points to keep this cover is necessary to have it stay in place. I will keep them and just have to make the necessary improvements myself to keep them from moving around."
3,OK film Not in line with the Bible,The picture has a good cast and the story portrays communication with the dead which is not in line with christina teaching in the Bible used in Protestant and Catholic churches.
2,Boring and predictable,I can't believe all the good reviews for this movie. It was boring and predictable. I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I turned it off before it was finished.
4,A study in contrasts...,"'The Monastery' was really a wonderful film. I was surprised by the documentary style format, for some reason, I was expecting it to have been more narrative in style; but I quite enjoyed the way it was presented. From my point of view as an Orthodox Christian, I was a little disappointed in the way some of the religious aspects of the film were covered, much too little coverage of some very important topics to the story. On the other hand, the unfolding story of the conflict and friendship between Mr. Vig and the Nun was wonderful, and was a very good object lesson in Christian conflict resolution. I would recommend this film for anyone who is interested in the Orthodox Faith."
5,Saving Private Memories,"Ethongraphy, Anthology, Short Stories, Interviews, whatever you call it, this book is full of splendid information; the kind of information that was about to get lost in time. There are first hand experiences from the ones who strengthened the revolution but were disappointed and betrayed by it."
5,Well Worth Listening To.,A fantastic album in every sence. Not one bad track! One of the best musical purchases I made while living in Spain. Hard rock with Spanish influences. Too Cool!
3,Ehhh...,"Okay, heres the deal.Cube world is a little toy, where you get 2 cubes per packeage, and each cube has a little person. Each has a hooby. In this case, scoop loves dogs, and slim likes to do stuff that involves sticks, or something.It wasn't as good as people raved about it.I mean, it's fun and all, but it won't keep your attention very long time. I probably need more, but then, why would I want more cubes? The cubes are highly overpriced, a price of a good DS game, and they get BORING.I sugest, to make it more fun, is to give one to a friend. So avery time you see him, you can connect your two cubes together have fun watching them. Other wise, it wasn't very good.Buy ONLY if you have money to waste. If you could have one toy, it would not be this one. I suggest something else, less exspensive."
3,I paid HOW MUCH????,"Ok- kids were begging for these for Christmas, yeah yeah yeah. We got them - two sets (twins) for them both. First off, they are VERY small. I was surprised at how small they were - only like 3-4 inches by 3-4 inches. I think the kids played with them for about a week and now they sit scattered around the house. Next - they aren't all that exciting to watch. I wasn't impressed."
3,ciewb review,The were fun to watch when they first arrived. After a while they became boring. I think they are better as an adult toy or desk top decor
3,About what I expected,"This is like a lot of those interactive games. They are mostly for you to watch and collect. They have mini-games that are mostly for you to try to break your own record. I would recommend to get more than just two cubes. They don't do much as a single cube and the more you add together, the more they do. They exceeded my expectations, but I would recommend this for 7-10 year-olds."
1,"Obscene toy, parents beware!","I thought these toys were fun and cute at first. I bought 2 for my 5 year old in anticipation of a plane trip, since it was quiet and required virtually no interaction from her to use it. My husband checked them out after my daughter had had them a few days and was shocked to see that when the characters visited each others cubes, one would sometimes molest the other and then retreat when rebuffed. I could not believe it myself, but the ""random"" act was repeated about once every 5 minutes or so and was unmistakably crude. I called customer service, and after speaking to a supervisor, I was told they had not had any other complaints and that they had no plans at all to recall the toys. BTW this is a Mattel subsidiary and I spoke with Mattel customer service and supervisor, Peggy Patrel (spelling?) with Mattel Consumer Relations in East Aurora NY. There are other complains on Amazon and Toys R Us."
1,NOT a custom case for the W810,"This case was NOT designed for the W810, it is a case that fits a variety of different models. The W810 does fit snuggly in the case, but being a Walkman phone, one would expect a hole on the side so that you could use the headphones. Unlike the picture, it has no such hole?.. so there is NO way to use the headphones while the phone is in the case. Also the description says it has a soft felt lining but it does not. The inside is just a tan colored leather. The large stitching is also tan in color and is not too attractive. Visit the Krussel website and search for the W810 case if you want to see an accurate picture. The case did seem like it was well built and the snap closer and belt clip were of high quality. If you want carry your phone around in a protective case and use the Walkman feature..this is NOT the case, plus it is a different product than pictured and described. I did receive a quick refund for my return."
4,The guide for those of us who run a lot of marathons,"This latest edition is greatly superior to the first editon. It is probably the most complete listing of marathons that can be found in one book. I have used it extensively in 1999, and plan to continue in 2000, as I attempt to run a marathon in all 50 states. This guide also provides the most comprehensive listing of international marathons that I have read. Super guide for those of us who love to get up on Sunday mornings to run 26 miles."
1,Buyers Beware,This product is not represented correctly......You will not receive what is pictured. What you will get is a <skin cleanser> with exfoliant. The product packaging was changed 5 years ago!
5,A delightful tuneful rarity performed by a spirited company.,"This is mature Kalman - he wrote good music, and linked it with intelligant librettos, and got better over time.This is a well designed ""stage"" show with good audience interactions not possible with a film, and so shows why there will always be room for live theatre, and as recorded this is superb theatre.The show is fun and the caste are talented and obviously enjoying themselves.I can listen to the two hours and 44 minutes of the recording - and listen to it again.The last ""bonus"" track, ""Heut' hab'ich getraumt von dir"" excellantly performed is the equal of the best of the lieders by the better known classical composers,Congratulations Ohio Light Opera!!"
4,"It's a great film, but ...","Same transfer.. No extended cut as expected. If you own the original, why bother to upgrade to 1.5? If you don't own it already, it's an easy purchase. ""Nuff said,"" as Stan Lee would say."
3,"5 for the movie, 2 for the DVD","ARGH . . . listen to this. Deleted scenes, right? Watch them in the extended branching version of the movie on DVD! Exciting! But these goobers at FOX can't even take the time to try and integrate the scenes into the movie. So this is what happens - the movie plays until you get to a deleted scene, and then the movie stops completely, your TV screen goes black, and then up pops the deleted scene, and after it's done it stops completely, and then goes back to the movie where you left off.This is incredibly annoying, and really, it makes the first disc worthless. Second disc is pretty interesting, although I doubt I'll watch it more than the once I already have."
5,second time around,"Of course this is the DVD that should have come out from the getgo but it was worth the wait. More extras than you can shake Toad's tounge at. It was so cool to really see the work that went into this. I enjoyed the behind the scenes stuff especially the highlights on the makeup and costumes. Yeah, it's still frustrating to see so many cool scenes that weren't used but as a comic book fan is was comforting to see that Bryan Singer and the crew really wanted to make this excellent and not another hack comic film (ex: The Punisher).The X-Men 2 sneak peek was really nice but there are so many other nuggets on part 1 the sneak wasn't really necessary. So if you love the series, are a major behind the scenes special feature nut, or did not buy the orginal X-Men DVD this is the one to have."
3,"Excellent Movie, Not DVD","If you already have the original released DVD of this dont bother getting the special released one because it has very few extra features. The movie is excellent great special effects, story follows true to the comic book so if you already have the original DVD, just keep that one."
3,"Movie's alright, DVD is somewhat depressing","Yes, special editions are overdone in today's market, but then again, if you'd like to avoid buying them, just sort of look at the movie's box-office returns. If it's big and it's obviously aiming at franchise-ness (like this film), then you can likely bank on a DVD rerelease prior to the sequel, and then if you don't see one, you can pick up the older release carefree. Still, it's not like they're all bad, the Lord of the Rings DVD was certainly worth buying -- unlike this X-Men ""Extended Edition"" (apparently), LotR actually had 35 minutes more footage on it, and the DVD was definitely worth owning...both of the LotR DVDs were.Anyway, the X-Men movie was alright. Maybe a little light, but then again, that's the way they come. Also, I've heard they desecrated the X-Men history, but nonetheless I enjoyed it. Not quite as good as 2002's Spider-Man, but still, a fun action ride."
3,X2 was better,"Well, this is an OK movie. But I think x-men 2, spider-man, the hulk. and superman were better then this"
1,Boredom and Tedium Ad Nauseam,"X-Men 1.5 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.So bad, in fact, that I'm unable to watch it a 2nd time -- in order to be 100% certain of my initial impression... (I mean, maybe I slept through a good part).A complete waste of time, money, talent, and the $10 spent on the DVD. It's amazing that a movie with such a good cast and production values can be such a dog.It's just that the WAY in which the story was told was REALLY BAD.Result -- Boredom and tedium ad nauseam."
1,What a waste of my money,"I am a lifelong X-men fan, and the first theatrical release of these costumed was not up to my expectations. But this DVD release of 1.5 was a total waste of time and money. I expected to see many things that they didn't have time for in the original film, but the deleted scenes were a complete joke. Some were just a 10 second addition, others a different angle (of the same scene), and some were essentially the same garbage as from before.The only positive for this DVD is the behind the scenes shots of when they were making the movie. But these were all previously released on home television on the Entertainment Channel's ""Behind the Scenes"" show when the film hit the theaters.Bottem line: If you like the film, buy the original and save yourself at least five bucks. But in my opinion you'd be better off to save your money and purchase the sequel (X-Men 2.0) when it's released to home video - it's a much better film."
4,see it,this is an A class super hero movie with alot of great extra features. this movie led the way for movies such as hulk and spider man and thats why its a great super hero movie. own it now
3,Fiction fiction,"Everytime I watch an X-Men movie, I see so much fiction that I feel the pizza boy will drop-in through the roof to hand my pizza, and then fly out the window to catch the next client!Cool movie, but I'd stick to X-Men 1"
5,An excellent adaptation,"In addition to Batman and X2, this is one of the only film adaptations to remain true to the comic, while also producing an excellent film. Although I can't stand Bryan Singer, he did an incredible job directing this film. Fans of the Marvel Series won't be dissapointed that all of their favorite mutants are included, and the characters are developed fairly well, given that this is a difficult task to do with so many characters.The 1.5 DVD is a must, even if you already own the original DVD. The extra features on the bonus disc are well worth the extra cost. This thing is packed with featurettes, commentaries, and is really entertaining to watch. If you're a fan of the comic book, you'll love the bonus features on the DVD."
1,I must have received a bootleg version,"The additional features on this disk don't work. When trying to access them, your given a totally different thing. I think this package was actually a bootleg version, cuz the package and other disk features are different from the BlockBuster rental version."
3,YOU CAN GET THIS SET OF DVDs AND MORE FOR A BETTER DEAL!!! READ ON...,"You can get this set of DVDs along with X2 and X2.5 in a set called The X-Men Collection. It's 4 DVDs for $35, but you can get it cheap used. I got the entire thing for $20 including shipping, barely more than this 2-disc set. Get the X-Men Collection instead, you'll be happier with it!"
3,AutoCad 2000 is an adequate book for learning atuocad,"I have personally used this book in a class that was taught by paul riley. Although there are errors in this book, it probably is because some of the actual drawings in the book came from the students at King Philip High School where he teaches. Riley knows his stuff. I actually know the person who drew the giant old house which is used as a challenge drawing."
4,This book will teach you the basics of AutoCAD and much more,I am a student in highschool and I have used Discovering AutoCAD 2000 and I learned so much from it. I thought I would learn only basic commands but I have learned very complicated commands. My only complaint is that some of the drawings have minor errors that should have been spotted by the editor. I hope to meet Paul Riley someday because he is my AutoCAD 2000 idle. If you have the money make sure you bye this book. The $45 seems like a hefty chunk of cash but this wonderful book is well worth the money.
1,WOW,This book was so boring and dull. I don't even know how she wrote it without falling asleep. The book was plain torture. Definately stay away from writing more books Dori. I also went to school with Dori; she is just as boring as her book.
1,What?,"This ""book"" honestly made me cry... in PAIN!If future American writers followed Dorien Block'scrusade to write sacchrine sweet trite, then the country'sbookshelves would be filled with wasted paper. Do NOTbuy this book, it's more detrimental to one's mind than TV."
2,the DEATH of literature,"""The Dori Story"" is proof that there are situations in which a mind is a fabulous thing to waste. If only trees and ink had not been added into the equation. Dorian Emily Devorah Yisraela Spaghetti Butterfly Block (a very fitting name for a fine young lady such as herself) seems intent on making the reader suffer through her life just as she must have. The book itself is reminiscent of the films ""Best in Show"" or ""Waiting for Guffman"", characters with no clue just how boring and pathetic their lives are. Perhaps the only purpose for this book is to use Dorian's eloquence to illustrate just how little one can learn from upstate New York schools. [....]-AW"
3,Knowing the Author,"I went to High School with Dori. I found her book to be nothing like what she had experienced in her life and thought it to be misleading. It was well written, however not factual as so claimed to be. I am indifferent as to whether or not I recommend this book based soley on the fact that in knowing her, I feel as though the story is based on fiction, not what was claimed to be written about."
5,Excellent Buy!,"This gamepad from Micro Connecters provides excellent control for all of your gaming needs. It is fast, durable, and very reflexive. Plenty of buttons to use for different moves. Great for sports games where you don't have enough buttons. For something this cheap it is a great buy. It really gives you your money back in performance."
1,Practically useless!,"I should have checked this area before I bought the book... tsk, tsk..Although you can use the tests to practice, I found that I was spending an enormous amount of time trying to understand why my answers were wrong. My conclusion was that the book actually contained MANY wrong answers! Since the author does not provide explanations, you can't understand the rationale in the (mostly wrong) answers! You will not find any advice particularly useful. I found ""Cracking the LSAT"" a much superior, worthwhile book!"
2,kids' stuff,"I needed a message center with cork & chalkboard, and this one had the look I was looking for. unfortunately, the product is poorly milled, with inferior wood, and no amount of sanding, staining, or adjusting made it fit together correctly. the best that can be said of it is: it works; and at least it holds together with screws instead of glue. definitely childish."
5,My grandson loves this toy.,My grandson is a Pokemon fan and particularly Blastoise. I ordered this toy for his birthday and I made his day.
4,Cool toy!,"The Blastoise Key Chain is pretty much as expected! It's about the size of your palm or a small apple. The toy looks like the picture shown, and seems durable. I wouldn't say it has educational value though, so I gave it one star.The water gun part was a creative feature, but doesn't work well for mine, just a little squirt. I didn't mind; I just wanted a key chain with this Pokemon.This toy is nearly $10, and I think it's a bit overpriced. It's good quality, but shouldn't be that high."
2,GREAT! (Er....Almost.),Arrived a day earlier than I even expected! Does everything promised although it is kinda hard to fill with water lol.15 minutes later: Started leaking...and I don't think you can take it back.....dang.
4,Follow the directions,"I have purchased two of the 64 MB Backpacks and have had no difficulty. (Shop carefully for price - ...) You MUST follow the directions for calibrating the battery, however. In one case, I replaced the Varga battery that came with the unit with a different brand of NiMH rechargeable for much better performance. You CAN use an Alkaline battery, but only if you are very careful. The battery compartment is not well-built and not made for changing batteries. It was designed for rechargeables. My batteries will go for about 10 hours between charges. Be advised, however, that NiMH batteries lose their charge gradually even if not used so it's a good idea to recharge regularly. I suspect the reviewer above did not calibrate the battery correctly or had a bad battery."
2,Less than fair,"Apparently, Sonicblue discontinued making this backpack for some time because it had a lot of problems-- the many serious issues were supposedly fixed.Calibration worked easy. The only problem was the supposed 'charging lamp' didnt go on, which created a lot of confusion.After calibration and testing, I had the battery drained and charged it up (because I thought the lamp didnt turn on because the battery was full)--It didnt go on. Battery level is entirely innacurate, and the mandatory rechargable battery doesnt last nearly as long as the ones I used before.The only positive thing is that it worksWith its bad history, my suggestion would be to buy a player from a reliable brand or one with better reviews."
1,piece of junk,"The backpack immediately made my player repeatedly turn off after about 90 seconds. If that wasn't bad enough, as incredible as it may seem, the backpack does not work with disposable AA batteries! You would have to take a handy but annoying recharger with you on any prolonged trip. I am returning it ... Let the buyer beware."
1,A Piece of [junk],"Followed directions to calibrate battery. After about 1 hour of use it turned on and off repeatedly and then off completely. Connected it to the charger and the LED continually lit saying that the battery is charged. Disconnected it with the battery reading at 96 % level. After about a few minutes of listening to a book, it did the same thing. Piece of junk. Plan to return it."
1,Won't ship to England?,"Great. So it's offered at $$$ but ""can't be shipped outside the US"". Is this bloody-mindedness or down to the fact that the charger would launch itself into space with our UK 230 volt supply voltage? (Who cares - I can buy a cheap charger here).My alternative is to buy a ""Backpack"" from Amazon UK. But wait - it's only a 32Mb unit and the cost is *twice* that of the 64Mb unit!Nah. I think I'll just buy a cheap Taiwanese MP3 player and trash this American junk. That seems to be the way the world is going."
2,Don't know how this worked...,...because the Rio 800 that I bought to use this with was defective....not a good overall product...fair warning.
4,Perhaps a 3.5 rating but worth reading,"...I couldn't put this book down and when read in conjuction with I.M. Lewis's fourth edition book 'A Modern History of the Somalia' it becomes more interesting. And, as an observer of East African issues I found the former's book to be spot on--in some instances. It is also important to remember that he is presenting the worst case scenario and speaking from experience, I know that it goes on but the sad experiences listed in his book do not represent the whole. There are a lot of great NGO and others out there making a difference in people's lives and in many cases, the host nation governments appreciate the assistance and work side-by-side with the foreigners. In some places, the intent is to have the relief workers work themselves out of a job--and it has been successful.But, that shouldn't keep you from reading this book. In fact, given the current famine in East Africa (2011) it should be a must read for those who want to do good without causing harm."
3,"Good start, interest faded","First off, I think this book should be retitled to reflect that 95% of the information is on Somalia and the charities & aid organisations there. I was hoping for a broader look at foreign aid rather than one case study. Nevertheless, this book was compelling at the beginning. I loved the personal story of Chris, (who worked for CARE in remote Somalia, his family was with him) for him it all went sadly wrong and this really touched me, and also Michael's own story of his time in Africa. But by the middle of the book, I found my interest waning. The personal stories were fading and I felt like I was bogged down in a boring array of facts. If you are looking for a book on Africa that is a wonderful personal experience, check out Keith Richburg's Out of America - it's brilliant."
2,How trustworthy,I got through the first chapter of this book and then realized there are no sources or citations for the information in this book. I did not bother to finish it because I can hear a million opinions on foreign aid but a good argument is built upon facts/sources.
2,An angry book but how can you not be angry?,I read this book with mounting anger it exposes the many issues of aid today. Another good reading is provided by books on the same subject matter may be with less anger but not less disgust and sense of helplessness. 'U.N. a Cosa Nostra'.U.N. a Cosa Nostra: The workings of an organization 'helping' the poorest of the world (Volume 1)
2,A disservice to an important issue,"A good book on international assistance still needs to be written. The Road to Hell and Graham Hancock's Lords of Poverty are unfortunately too morally indignant and sensationalist to be of practical value. I was witness to much of what Maren wrote about in Somalia. Yes, it was a mess, but his gonzo style and cavalier tone does not begin to give a revealing picture of what was happening, the options available and the subtexts. When I tried to contact Maren by email to clarify certain points on which he wrote erroneously he never responded. It's too bad. International assistance is an extremely important issue, one that many of those involved are constantly seeking ways in which to improve their performance and the value of their efforts. I don't think there are many who are involved in the field would say that they are happy. Still, Maren is just too flippant to be taken seriously."
4,Inciteful and Informative,"I really liked this book. It gives alot of first hand accounts of the problems with international aid. It is a fast read, and isn't ""academic"" like so many of the other books you see on the subject of international development. The only thing I would have liked a little more of, would be have been a breif history of Somalia, Rwanda and Kenya, which would have been helpful in understanding the total context of the book."
4,Recommended Reading!,"This book has changed the way I think about foreign aid. Maren shows how much of our so-called help is really the effort to control other cultures or make a little money. I thought that this book was fast pased and well-documented. Maren is obviously a caring and thoughtful person who was disturbed by what he saw in Africa and did his best to discover the truth about foreign aid. Unlike most authors, he does not even attempt to suggest a solutions to the problems he uncovered. Though he does not actually say so, he implys that there is really nothing we can do about many of the problems of the world and that our interference only makes matters worse. He ends the book with a disturbing experience which shows how all our attempts to play God and fix the world crumble in the face of the awesome reality of human tragedy."
5,Like tomata with out the,"Great buy, My three son who this was for and his 7yr old brother and Five ans 20 month old sisters love it. It is use well ans shows no signs of distress. Easy to put together.Was here in time for CHRISTmas. Looking for the ""Lighting McQueen"" one now and will purchase with [...]"
3,Great trike but handlebar twists off-center,"I'm wondering if anyone has the manufacturer's warranty address or phone number. I can't seem to find mine. I believe my hubby probably tossed it after assembling it. My son got it for his 4th birthday and it does seem a bit small for him. He loved it except he hasn't ridden it since the handlebar twists off-center after he makes a couple of turns. Has anyone else encountered this particular problem? My hubby tightened and straightened it several times but it still does it. I don't think there was a missing part?? But I didn't put it together; my hubby did and he didn't have any parts left over. So, if anyone has the manufacturer's contact information, please list it. This is the frustrating part of this tricycle. Otherwise, my son says he loves the tow cable in the back."
2,Handlebar problem,"I got this tricycle for my son for Christmas in 2006 when he was three. I though it would be perfect for him because he loves trucks of every shape. We encountered the same problem with the handlebar coming loose and turning off-center from the front wheel. Like the other reviewer I followed the directions meticulously while putting it together and found no extra parts. If I did it wrong, the directions are bad. Tightening temporarily fixes it but it soon loosens up again. The tow hook does not unroll very easily either and my son often needed help. In spite of the problems it did get a lot of use. My son is now ready for a two wheel bike but still pulls it out to play with the tow hook. Mixed review for me. I can't recommend it."
4,Happy with this purchase,"I bought this for my (almost) [....] son. He loves it! However, he is just a little short to reach the pedals completely. He can rest his feet on them, but when he tries to pedal, his feet come off just a bit. He loves the wench on the back and tries to attach almost everything possible to it. It's definitely much sturdier than some of the other trikes I tried in the store. The only reason I am giving it a four is because of the little handlebar guard. I know it's there for protection as well as decoration, but my son takes it off all the time. I would have liked it if there was some way to keep it on permanently so it serves the protective purpose better. At this point, we have just taken it off. Overall, I am very happy with the tricycle and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to buy it."
5,sweet,I got this for my grandsons birthday he turned 2 years old and he rides it every where and won'rt share with his brother
5,WOAH!,"Seriously these are the best nylon pants i ever bought. considering the fact that im a bboy, these pants are amazing. i tried buying another set of nylon pants from charles river on amazon, and take my word, but their pants suck. You will get something completely different than what you see on the computer screen. Stick to code four athletics. The only thing i need to say is that Code Four Athletics need to restock the red nylon's in a small size!"
3,Not 3 pockets,This is a good pant and looks and wears well. I thought the ad stated it would have two side pockets and a hip pocket but what I received does not. No billfold pocket drops these from 5 to 3 stars.
5,FAST SHIPPING!!!!,"Okay, so I bought these pants on Thursday night and they got to my house on Saturday morning. I am really impressed by how well they fit me. On the inside of the pants, there is a white liner. There are zippers on the pants which are really nice if you play soccer. They kind of make a loud noise when you walk, but then again, don't all sweatpants? Overall, this is a great product and IT SHIPPED FAST and for the money I paid, I might buy a second pair."
3,warm up pants,Have not used this pants yet but should serve my purpose just fine. The inseam is a little long and hope it won't trip me up.
4,This is an excellent mix of 70s music!,"There are songs for all on this one! Everyone will know one of these favorites from the seventies, young and old alike. GREAT VARIETY! Buy it, you'll love it..."
3,Not bad stuff,"After reading the reviews I decided on this stuff. I hate when lube gets stickey and you have to keep reapplying it. It doesnt get sticky and it leaves the skin with a silky feeling, however I think the longevity of this could be better. It doesnt last as long as I had hoped and expected. Overall a good product but more for sprints and quickies vs. marathons or all nighters. Good for about 10-20 mins max. whether its solo or with a partner."
2,upside down,"Overall the book is good. However, the pages of the book are upside down from the cover. So, it looks like I am reading the book upside down. I tried to call Amazon, left an email message...but no one called."
4,"Nice stands, limited movement","These are basic speaker stands. For as nice as the wall mounts are that came with the system I expected a little more as far as being able to position the speakers on the stand. Once they're mounted you have to move the entire stand to angle the speakers.There was missing hardware in the package I got. I bought them off eBay (listed as new, unused) so I'm not sure if that's why some was missing or like the previous reviewer it was missing from the factory."
5,Nice Stands,I didn't require any assistance from my building handyman boy. The instructions were good did. you have all the parts?
4,Tough Subjects Incisively Illuminated,"Tony Rothman has written a fascinating tome on the many misinformations firmly implanted in our consciousness aboutwho invented what, from ancient times to the 20th Century.While some of the subjects covered are very tough for anyone not scientifically trained, Rothman tries to leaven his narrative with flashes of unexpected humor, often with success. Definitely not a book to be devoured at one sitting, but rather one to bedipped into at leisure, and worth returning to again and againto fully grasp the significance of his research."
1,Hidden Motives?,I have had this book for a couple of years now and have just finished forcing myself to read it a second time. I can find only two reasons this book was written: 1- The authors deep hatred (and obviously obsessive) of Time magazine. 2- His desire to prove he is smarter then you by using big words that no one in their right mind uses in ordinary conversation. I prefer to read books that are actually about the title subject. If you want to know more about the history of inventions or science your money is much better spent on any other book.
2,Hero-hater,"This book is written by a spiteful and envious person who's sole purpose is to bring down history's scientific heros. Heros without whom we would not be enjoying the safe, healthy and comfortable lives we live today."
4,Does a guy's HEIGHT matter?,"This is Bill and Dave's advice column in Girls' Life magazine (aimed at girls 10 and up, according to GL's website). They are answering a question from a girl whose BF is shorter in overall height than she is. Their answer is OK, but it is merely one of four questions about boyfriend relationships. It has nothing to do with, shall we say, the other, more intimate, size-matter question. There are no graphics in the 1 1/3 or so page download, so whether the original magazine page hinted at the actual subject of the first question rather than teasing us as the title does is impossible to tell. I took off one star because of the teasing title--would any adult not think of the 'other' subject first? But how innocent are 10-and-up girls nowadays?"
5,Tastes great!,"By far one of the best tasting mixes i have tried, the dried apples add just the right amount of sweetness to the cinnamon mix."
1,Too Light,This was a very light read - the writing seemed juvenile. The characters didn't give me anything to care about - they seemed very shallow and materialistic.
3,Very light entertainment,I enjoy this series because I love hearing about the life of a NYC magazine writer. This is the third in a series and better than the other two since discovering who the murderer was more clever and suspenseful. A recommended beach read!
5,Mother of a read...,"I really enjoyed this book. I am the mother of a 14 month old and have not been able to stay with a book (I like the murder mystery genre) since I was pregnant. For those of you with little ones you know what it's like trying to read with an infant needing your constant attention and then later a toddler ripping the book out of your hands. This one I can steal a chapter or a half a chapter here and there (during naps and such) and not get ""lost"" when I pick it back up again. I found it while reading a selection from it in Cosmo. What a find."
2,Not super-great,"I really liked Kate White's first book, but the same can't be said for her last two. This book, A Body To Die For, just seemed to go through the mystery motions. White seems to like to throw a lot of people in the mix that had reasons to be the guilty party, so I tried to play along and keep an open mind. Still, by the end of the book, I didn't care who did it, and finding out wasn't gratifying on any level. I also didn't care about any characters, including Bailey, the protagonist. Every character was at best two-dimensional."
1,Yad Yada Yada It's not good,"You should read this because: Premise is good, denouement is fairly clever, the book might be on sale.You should not read it because: The characters are shallow and not well drawn, the plot is not engaging, the dialogue is silly and contrived and surely you have got better things to do.This was a total waste of time and effort--no inducement is large enough to get me to read again or recommend this book to even the dimmest of human beings.Yep -- a little harsh but, it is what it is."
2,Would like this tool a lot better if it didn't rust,"Bought this tool along with a couple of others on the strength of the Hyde brand, but was very disappointed when it started to show rust spots after 3 weeks of working with compound. Rust, really?? Maybe my expectations were too high, but my old generic brand 3-inch flex scraper was unblemished after 10 years of usage."
3,"Great scraper, annoying sticker","The scraper works very well and is great for light use. However, the sticker is annoying enough to knock a star off because it hampers the functionality of the product if you cannot remove it properly. It is not your typical fisher price sticker and will leave an amazing amount of gunk behind."
3,HARD TO REMOVE PRODUCT LABEL,"I am sure this is a good tool, looks sturdy and well made. But I had a helofa time removing the label that covered the entire one side. First I heated the tool with a small electric heater and started scraping it off with my finger nail, while trying not to get a burned finger. But that still left a bunch of the underside of the label on tight; and the goop used on the label was still stuck tight to the metal.Next, I got a kitchen spatula, soaked the label side of the tool with nail polish remover and with the spatula scraped and scraped to remove it all.Why can't manufacturers use labels that will come off easier; this type of thing is a real irritation."
3,Hate the stickers,"These are pretty good scrapers, but this D-I-Yer really dislikes the stickers that Hyde puts on the blades of its products. Hard to remove easily and thoroughly. Often, there's a barcode sticker on one side and an advertising sticker by Hyde on the other. What a pain!"
1,Aweful Stickers and rust,I tried to peel off the sticker and it couldn't be done. I soaked it overnight in water to loosen the glue and the next morning it was covered in rust. Now it's in the garbage. Good riddance!
2,watch winder life span,Do not expect your watch winder to last more than two years. First Regal lasted less than one year but warranty service covered the winder and repaired it. It then lasted two years more. So do not pay more than $100 because you will have to get a new one every two years or so.I am trying a Heiden product this time to see if it outlasts Regal.
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I purchased this based on the CooksIllustrated.com review. It always read higher than my oven's sensor (and I already know my oven doesn't run that far off). Within 6 months, it simply stopped working."
4,Does it's job,"We bought this because we weren't trusting the temperature in our oven. It turned out that the oven was correct, but the thermometer was off by twenty degrees. However, the error is consistent, so we just subtract 20 then we read the temperature. Neighbors bought the same product and theirs is right on. Just the luck of the draw, I guess."
1,Too hard to read,This thermometer got a very good review but when I got it I couldn't understand why. The face is too small to read when in the oven. If the oven light is behind the thermometer there is no way to see the dial without a flashlight. I had to return mine because it wasn't working. I have many thermometers from CDN and I love them so I was very dissapointed with this one.
3,Pointer not red.,"The thermometer I received works and is true to temperature. I bought it thinking it would hang like my others-but I found the magnet very convenient. Although, to put in the back of the oven, I found the dial too small, compounded by the fact that the pointer on my thermometer is grey, not red, which is really my biggest complaint."
4,Good item with slow movement,The workmanship of the item is excelllent. But the movement of the reading bar is very very slow. The movement of the reading bar will give you pain.
1,not so good,"The dial is hard to read (numbers are too small). Also it's way off compared to my oven's sensor. I expected to see 20 or 30 degrees difference (and I was prepared to believe this thermometer over to oven), but the differences are 50 to 70 degrees. I don't believe it. Bottom line, I've thrown this away."
2,terrible quality control,"The first unit came in with a dented dial face inside the case where only the factory (in China) could touch it. It caused the pointer to drag and jerk as it tried to warm up. I sent it back for exchange and waited for the second unit to arrive. About 10 days later I tried the replacement unit and it seemed to be about 25-30 degrees off. Then I noticed it read 105 degrees sitting on the kitchen counter when the house was about 70 degrees. I contacted CDN in Portland and they offered to send me a free replacement so I returned the second unit to Amazon for a refund. Even the one from CDN was off by 20 degrees so I used a mercury lab thermometer and adjusted the plate inside the back of the thermometer (technically it's not adjustable) to read 100 degrees C when the lab thermometer did. It is slow to come up to temp but so is my old thermometer, so don't believe your oven when it beeps ready 5 minutes after you turn it on. Give the oven 15 minutes to come up to temp."
3,inexpensive but gets the job done well,"I also bought this thermometer based on the review in Cooks Illustrated. When I first checked it in my oven it read 25 degrees warmer then my old thermometer which had become old and difficult to read due to heavy brown staining inside the dial, on the face. My old thermometer used to read 25 degrees higher than the dial on my oven but now it matches the oven. Who knows if any of these inexpensive units are accurate. Once I put this new thermometer up on the wall of the oven using the magnetic back it then matched the old thermometer and the oven dial. I verified the readings to be accurate by using my digital probe thermometer. I basically only use this (and my old one) to verify the oven has come up to temperature. I use the good old toothpick method for baking and/or my digital probe thermometer for things like roasts etc. so all in all it is accurate,inexpensive, and does the job it is supposed to do."
3,Didn't use it,I was anxious to use this oven thermometer but had to return it as the dial began at 125 degrees and not at zero (or 100). I didn't know if the temperature reading would be off by 25 degrees so I didn't take a chance. I ended up going with another brand.
2,Pandering,"Clearly this cable channel said, ""How can we get more viewers?"" and answered, ""Let's bring in the dog lovers."" I thought this work would be full of ""Big dogs do X, but little dogs do Y."" ""Little dogs live X years, but big ones live Y."" Really, this was just about dogs as pets generally. If you are a dog owner and want to learn that humans have had dogs as pets for centuries and that millions of others are dog owners and lovers like you, then peep this. Otherwise, this presents nothing incredibly new. It's dogs, dogs, and more dogs, nothing more, nothing less."
1,Disappointing,"The parts of this set are not well made - light, flimsy plastic. The highlight of the set, the battery-operated hairdryer, worked for a few seconds and then never again, even with fresh batteries - I suspect due to poor connection. The cover for the battery compartment was badly made and didn't sit well. The rest of the items included are nothing to write home about either. I bought this for a Christmas present for my dd and sent it back for a refund."
5,good choice,"Bought this for my son's junior violin, and it fits really good. It is simple to assembly and attach to violin. Also, it is really light, though this makes it feel cheapy."
3,Just ok,"I was initially happy with this product and how easy it was to put together and hang on the wall. It wasn't until I had company over that it was pointed out to me how warped the wood was - the piece out to the left looks like it slopes increasingly downward. I plan to bring it to Home Depot to get it cut off, at which point I will have to repaint it, so I'd say it's okay, but not great."
5,Good looking shelf,This shelf unit is wonderful! The wood is beautiful and sturdy. It is simple to put together - you just slot the pieces together. Instructions weren't even necessary. We've put a collection of rocks and fossils on the shelf; it's a great display piece. We get lots of compliments on it.
4,Great modern shelf,"Very easy to put together but slots do not lock into one another so you have to be very careful when putting it up. Looks beautiful in the room, though, and it was a great price compared to other comparable shelves. I get lots of compliments on it!"
4,"Modification, modification.","Purchased the shelf, but it doesn't fit very well on a LED/LCD TV, the TV is too thin for the shelf legs that came with the product. If your TV isn't mounted on the wall then you have 4 empty bolt holes on the back of the TV. I made shelf legs out of thin aluminum strips and mounted the strips to the 4 empty bolt holes and then mounted the shelf on top of the strips with an L bracket. Pretty easy to do. The shelf is built sturdy and should last the length of your TV."
1,Didn't fit on my TV,"This was supposed to fit all TV's. It did not fit on a level plane on my TV, even when I tried installing it upside down as per some other reviews. Amazon was great about my returning this item since it did not work as it was supposed to."
4,Works pretty well!,"The directions were just a little confusing, and I wound up having to move the legs around several times to get the right ""fit"" for my television set, but this item works great, and seems sturdy enough for the VCR."
4,Nice shelf - if you can figure out the instructions!,"My husband and I bought (2) of these shelves online because Circuit City was charging around $40 each for the same item. We have a Hitachi 57in. DLP TV. We set up the shelves, the instructions were ridiculous, but you can pretty much figure out for yourself how they're suppposed to be put together. After all that, we put our DVD player, VCR, Cable box and xbox on the shelves (DVD and cable box were centered between the 2 shelves). In the middle of the night, we heard a loud bang. Both of them had fallen down. Nothing was damaged, except a tiny ding on the wall that was eaisly fixed. My husband got some industrial strength velcro and put it on the tiny legs that rest on the back of the TV. It's been over a month now and we haven't had any problems since. We probably have a higher weight on them than recommended. The only reason I'd give it 4 stars is because of the instructions that (quoting my husband) ""seemed to be written by a 4-year-old""."
1,Not for every height,"Product suggests rear supports will handle any length up to 11+ inches, but excludes *many* lengths in between. For instance, my television requires legs to go 2.75 inches, but the supports either go up to 2inches or 4.5inches and up. That's a pretty big gap!"
4,Does exactly what it should.,"It was easy to assemble, it is not obtrusive in any way, it is sturdy, and does what it's supposed to: hold things (ie: cable box). It blended right in with the TV, and did not have issues blocking the Wii motion bar.Several months later the TV died and we were ""forced"" to buy a new flat-screen. Not sure how this shelf will remain useable.Anyway, if you need a TV shelf, this is THE ONE."
4,A Nice Guitar For The Price,This guitar has a very nice sound and is easy to tune and holds it;s tune very well. Just as I expected
4,Ovation,I had an ovation a long time ago. And while this is their cheaper model it still has the same nice touch on the neck and sounds good. Happy strumming.
5,Not to be believed for the money!!!!,"I just received this guitar and I am in utter disbelief about how wonderful it is!!! For $126.22 shipping included, I have a beautiful guitar that is every bit as good as the original Ovation Balladeer circa 1968. I really can't get over the quality of this guitar; I have yet to find something that I don't like about it. If you are even remotely considering buying this guitar in the future, buy it today as I am sure they will not last at this price once people play one for themselves and see the extreme quality that this instrument offers."
4,"Good, inexpensive Beethoven","I was previously familiar with Giulini's version of the ninth which is splendid. Great clarity of sound, lots of tension, and emphasis in all the right areas. I own 32 different versions of this work and this is in the top 5 of those recordings. Kempe's version of the sixth was a revelation. Imaginative and poetic. Best of all, you can't beat the price."
2,Since when does a bag need instructions? THIS ONE DOES,"The straps on this bag are a mess. The buckle is hard to adjest without a hug loose end. The ""third leg stabiler strap is just plain annoying.. An instruction manual is needed to position the straps.. after about 20 minutes of trying to adjust them, I am no longer interested in wearing this bag.. it will sit in the back of the closet because it just is a pain to get adjusted without any type of guide"
5,baby shower present,My cousin is a football nut and was blessed with a baby boy. This made the best baby shower gift!
2,"Not a Good How to, not very erotic","If you are looking for a good how to, this is not it. If you are looking for erotic material, I'm sure there are other works out there. I bought this book expecting tips and methods. But there are only a few sections on how-to. Be sure to check this one out at a bookstore before buying. It may not be what you want."
3,Bad Ending...,"There is a reason why Rome was not built in a day. You should never rush a work of epic proportions. Especially a novel 694 pages long! Alastair Reynolds lays a great foundation. I love his universe; it has all the best combinations sci-fi offers, which are revealed in a slow but suspenseful manner through Alastair's somewhat dark tone of writing. The two main characters, Sky and Tanner, are developed much more in-depth than in your average sci-fi novel. Where this book fails is in the last hundred pages. If you don't mind a crappy ending then you will have no problem with this book. Honestly, if I knew how bad the ending was in the first place I would still read it. It's one of those long books that really lets you escape into it. I just wish Reynolds would have given the ending a second look because this book deserves better."
3,Not as good as Revelation Space,"For fans of Revelation Space, this one disappoints. There are no new ideas here, it's just more of the same with less interesting characters. Even so, it's smarter and more fun than most of the genre."
5,Free SF Reader,"Chasm City is a dangerous place, infected with The Melding Plague that destroys techno-organic implants and augmentation.The failed mercenary Tanner Mirabel arrives here after a long space voyage, and the death of his previous charges.Mirabel is following the man that killed his wife and his charge, and is after revenge. He has to work his way up through the society of the City. He comes to the attention of the rich and long lived and ends up working there, further complicating things. They like to play bizarre games to try and relieve their ennui.On his long voyage he had been infected with a bizarre type of religious memory virus about the founder of the planet Skys Edge, his original home. This causes Mirabel to question what is going on, and his own memory, to finally get to the heart of the mystery."
4,"Same universe as Revelation Space, not a sequel",I enjoyed reading Revelation Space all the way through until the end. I felt the climax didn't sufficiently bring the story lines together. But this review is for Chasm City!One major difference is the book being written in 1st person. The sub plots aren't as tangential in this book and they are brought together nicely at the end. At the same time I found the ancient historical sub plot about Haussman more interesting than the main story line. Over all I liked the book better than the first and will be starting in on Redemption Ark soon.
2,Read something else,"If you *really* like both noir and hard sf, this is a must-read. It's fairly well written; you'll feel the unshakeable low-grade despair of the characters in your gut. And there's a set piece involving a space elevator that--I must admit--is pretty darn cool.But ultimately there was nothing here to hold my interest. The plot is nothing special: I've seen essentially the same plot in more entertaining works. The setting felt a little flat, or maybe contrived. I found the characters unsympathetic."
2,"Neat ideas, absurd characters","Chasm City embodies the stereotypes most people have about space opera to an almost embarrassing degree. There are Big Sweeping Vistas and Millenia-Old MacGuffins; there's also an entire cast of characters crafted from the finest cardboard. Every one of them, including the main character, behaves like a James Bond villain. This makes it really rather difficult to give a damn what happens to them, so in the end this was a chore to finish."
3,"Better than the first, but still not good enough.","I read Revelation Space, the author's first book, and although it was interesting, it seemed to take for ever to read, and when it was finished, I wasn't at all sure what I had read. This new book is easier to read and moves along much better, but still jumps around too much between different characters. I though it was billed as a sequel, but it actually has pratically nothing similar to the first book. I think this writer will eventually make the grade, but not yet."
2,Epically Mediocre,"This HUGE book has some decent moments, but eventually collapses under its own weight in the end.The main character ends up with at least 3 personalities running around in his head... and that's just the beginning of the confusion - by the final scene, it gets to be just too much, and becomes ludicrous, to the point of basically ruining this long book (~700 paperback pages).It is too bad really, because the book stands up well technically - it just tries to do too much in terms of plot twists.CHASM CITY (2001) provides more in-depth background for the REVELATION SPACE series(it was the 2nd book written, but takes place in time before the first book from the series); but, to be honest with you, I'd recommend you skip this one, and move straight on to the first book in the series, REVELATION SPACE (2000) as there is plenty enough explanation of Chasm City there."
1,"His other books are great, this one is terrible","I loved House of Suns, and Revelation Space (the previous book in this series) wasn't bad. Chasm City, however, is a disaster. It reads like it was written in a day -- and never edited. The characters are worse than flat, the plot is unrealistic, and when I finally reached the revealing conclusion, I found myself disappointed."
4,none,"Reynolds is a writer to watch, his reputation and novels are fast joining the ranks of classic Baxter, Clarke, Brin, and Benford, but wildly original. A wholly new and exciting voice in SF. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
2,"i didn't get the logic, would not recommend","books like contact make sense to me. but this book. it made no sense to me. i can point out a couple:1.) no structure of the society it describes made sense. the only things in detail which made sense are genetic body change and boredom with long life (and honestly that still made less sense to me, why people would not spend time to learn more, that's what i would expect someone with long life would do, and long life come with no retirement age, you do have to earn a living you as long as you live)2.)why sky wants to be good now. and why he became bad. made no sense at all.3) the magot, its behaviour made no sense,this is hardly a SF, it is more like a thriller. with bad science plot or imagination.would not recommend it."
1,could do with out atleast a hundred pages of this book,"Chasm City turns out to be an okay book in the last quarter if you are patient enough to reach there; I almost gave up after 100 pages or so b/c the plot is so ordinary and unengaging. What really irked me about this book is the fact that the author decided to explain every detail of the characters experience - the mechanics of every ship the characters board, every gun they shoot, so on.... I give it one star only for the last quarter of the book."
3,Staggers under its own weight.,"Like many of the reviewers, I really enjoyed Revelation Space and wanted to like this book a lot more than I ultimately did.The problem was that the story does not really hold together well. The interesting details and backstory keep you reading, but I found that in the end I had rather forgotten what it was actually about and didn't have the sense that it held together very well at all.Reynolds remains a talented and interesting writer, and this will not dissuade me from reading another of his books, but I certainly wouldn't *begin* here if I had not read Revelation Space yet."
5,I think this is his best.,"One of his earliest books, I still think it's the best. I love the feeling I get from immersing myself into this universe. No better science fiction writer is living today."
3,Entertaining but too wordy,"Schizoid sociopath tries to make amends for crimes he--or someone--may or may not have committed and chases a deeply affronted interplanetary playboy all in the company of a transgendered zebra girl.Crazy, crazy stuff.I have thoroughly enjoyed other Reynolds books I've read. He's a bit wordy, but good, so it's forgivable. Chasm City, however, should have been about at least 100 pages shorter. I loved the mind-bending plot twists, but there were too many superfluous characters and scenes. I realize that some of those scenes (e.g. Voronoff and the restaurant) were there to flesh out the culture and backstory of Yellowstone and Chasm City, but they didn't add anything to the story. I found Voronoff and Chanterelle to be especially irritating. Useless time-wasters. Maybe I missed some deeper truths Reynolds was trying to convey. If so, they were lost in all the words. For the most part, I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better."
2,Below Alastair's average,"As in others Alastair's novels, there are two stories. The main one is too long and it result predictable an boring. The second story is much more interesting and it's what keep me interested. Even so, as a whole, the novel is not good.This is the third novel from Alastair that I've read, (and I liked the other 2 very much) but this one is dissapointing."
3,Good for fleshing out the Revelation Space series,"This is Reynolds' second book in the Revelation Space series. It is a complex story told on multiple levels -- as we have come to expect from Reynolds. The main character, Tanner Mirabel, is a security specialist bound on revenge for the death of a woman he loves. But, it turns out that he is much more than that; he has a deep and dark history that slowly reveals itself. I am not sure exactly why, but I did not enjoy this book as much as I did Revelation Space and (especially) Pushing Ice. The story feels a bit contrived and the ending wasn't satisfactory to me. That said, I expect to read all of the series."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I liked Revelation Space well enough, but I am a hard SF guy and Mr Reynolds apparently wants to move into fantasy - the buildings catch a disease and the society becomes wierd and pathological. I suspect he read China Mi√©ville's Perdido Street Station one time too many. Then, there is the inconsistency of Tanner, the hard guy, being beaten up by a couple of monks, and a few pages later he is kicking the ... out of a professional thug with ""a neck like my thigh"". I tossed it in the trade-ins at about 100 pages."
1,What plague?,"I was seduced by the back cover's promise of a plague-infested world where ""only the most wretched sort of existence remains."" Instead of delivering on this promise, the author uses the plague only as an ""explanation"" for why the once technologically advanced inhabitants of Yellowstone now have to go about in Tarzan-like cable cars and even rickshaws. For all the talk of a plague, we only come face to face with a real victim only once! Furthermore, the ""centuries-old atrocity that history would rather forget"" is a real disappointment.The meat of this book is about the main character trying to recover his identity. With its introverted focus, everything going on around the character is mere sideshow. It is puzzling that with such a promising concept Reynolds chose to write a drama of the mind and little more."
1,could do with out atleast a hundred pages of this book,"Chasm City turns out to be an okay book in the last quarter if you are patient enough to reach there; I almost gave up after 100 pages or so b/c the plot is so ordinary and unengaging. What really irked me about this book is the fact that the author decided to explain every detail of the characters experience - the mechanics of every ship the characters board, every gun they shoot, so on. ..."
1,What is this book ?,"well I must admit this was the first book I have read of Alastair Reynolds and I did not read Revelation Space, had I this review may have been even worst.This book was a hassle to read but I was determined to finish it, once I start something I finish it. The writing in this book is very childish and seemed like something of child living out his fantasies. The main character is portrayed to be something of a cross between Rambo and Macgyver with the supposed charm and character of James Bond. Corny lines and a plot which seemed very contrived and padded out there was literally only smalls sections of this book which kept me interested but it still seemed more interesting then watching the scenery pass by on the train although I am not so sure now. I have not read many books where I kept looking at the page numbers to see how far I had to go.Dont get this book you will not miss anything and my fingers are crossed that Greg Bear releases another book soon."
1,Rubbish,"Good ideas, bad writer.When this sort of rubbish is being published today, then I fear just about anyone with a subscription to a few science journals (for the techno-babble filler) is capable of writing ""sci-fi""."
1,Singer/Writer Index,"This isn't a true Songwriters guide, it's focused more on famous SINGER Songwriters. It includes only a small handful of only the most famous Songwriters that became recording artists. I can't imagine paying 175 for this. If someone hasn't done an encyclopedia of songwriting, they need to, and probably at least one Volume for each genre. Very disappointing."
2,Stuffy and Shrill,"The Oxford Book of Villains is a collection of excerpts from books purporting to deal with villains of all kinds. I had hoped to find help as to how to write evil. But if the Book has any raison d'etre above venerating old classics, its merely discouraging readers from a life of crime and heresy.Perhaps the Oxford Book of Villains is aiming for some sort of purpose or mood, and I've missed it. I tend to give anything that so much effort has been put into the benefit of the doubt. It desperately needs that doubt in order for me to see even a flicker of imagination in its careful categorization of The Spirit of Evil, Master Crooks, Minor Crooks, Murderers...In each case, the book maintains a shocked, Victorian distance from the subject matter, and lingers on each text only long enough to persuade the reader that indeed, the subject is very naughty and deserves jail."
2,Too short,"Bought these - but they were too short. My error - still, good quality - but runs small too. Order carefully."
2,Issue with large memory cards,"While the player is quite nice (especially for the money), I was quite disappointed to find out it only supports SmartMedia up to 64MB. When I ordered it, a 128MB was on the recommended list, so I got it. I never imagined a lack of support so I thought one or the other was broken until I tried a 64MB with no trouble. That is when I noticed a small line in the manual naming support for 8, 16, 32 and 64... Quite a limitation for a unit already low on built-in memory."
4,How to fix the too small belt clip!!,"The player doesn't fit in the belt clip. :( But you can fix that! Here is what you need:1.)A lighter.2.)Fingers.3.)The belt clip.Take the lighter and melt the plastic bands on the belt clip for just a few seconds, while you pull the plastic taut with your fingers. Work slowly so you don't burn yourself or start a small fire. ;) Don't breathe the plastic fumes. :pGuess and test to see how far you should stretch the plastic so that the player fits perfectly and then you are done. Yay!"
2,Horrible Customer Service,"When I recieved this product as a gift I discovered it was not compatable with windows XP, I called samsungs customer service line waited about an hour and finally got tired of waiting. The next day I sent them an e-mail they replied saying they were working on it. I waited about a month then sent them another e-mail and then they said they weren't going to make xp drivers. Why did they not just tell me this from the start so I could return the product emmediately?"
3,"price cheap, feels cheap, is cheap","This deal isn't as great as it sounds.. you are getting what you paid for. It's (inexpensive) because it is a cheap player. You can check for yourself on the Samsung website. The battery cover really does suck. It takes a lot of force to get the cover closed after you put batteries in it. And they give you an extra one... which hints at how seriously bad it is. The player as a whole just feels really cheap. Also, the remote is clumsy and difficult to hold due to its design and where all the buttons are. I give it 3 stars because it does what it's supposed to do for the price you pay for it. I bought one, and I'm returning it. I'd rather shell out like 30 more bucks for a Rio 500 with 64 mb onboard memory. Now that is a player."
3,decent product,Works well with XP. Realjukebox software slows down computer tremendously. Belt clip doesn't fit. Very annoying. Only takes up to 64MB smart cards. Otherwise a decent purchase.
2,Yepp NO,"Ok...first of all this comes with real audio...real jukebox...with no support for Windows Media Player...Now you'd figure that Real Audio would make the thing work with Real One...Yepp? NO...Heres the thing just download the mp3 software that communicates directly with the Yepp player from Samsung ...which is better anyway...Yepp? Yep..Other downers...the unit does not time out...so if you leave the battery on it will be very dead!! Yepp? YEPP!! Also if you have it in you pocket and lean against something...dead battery..and dead yepp..It needs a smartmedia card...otherwise it's total useless...but it only takes 64mb...so unless you are listening to the ""best of asia""...this going to be frustrating..not enough songs!! Yepp!!So if you are looking for something cheap...then this is ok...but it burns batteries like crazy...so keep extra batteries with you!!! YEPP!!"
3,"Nice, but has a problem with the smartmedia card","Got my Yepp last week...pretty cool little package. It would be great if I could get it to work with my smartmedia cards!! I've tried an 8MB and 64MB card, to no avail. Anybody else have this issue also??Pros:It's loud!Has a high techno gadget factor.Decent EQ settings.Cons:Earbuds are useless.Using the remote control and headphones is awkward.RealJukebox software is (bad)...use the Yepp explorer."
4,Great Product,"This MP3 player is great, especially for the price. Easy to transfer files and very small and lightweight. It does feel a little flimsy, but that is why it's so light and only 4 stars. Definately the player to get on a limited budget"
1,poor technical support,"the player arrived defective, technical support was difficult to access and barely helpful even then. suppose i could've exchanged the player for another, but by then i was ready to hurl it out the window and in no mood for another. sounds like others have had better experiences with this, fortunately."
3,you get what you pay for...,"I recently purchased this MP3 player. I have a couple of gripes: First, when the LCD lights up I can hear it in the headphones. Second, the belt clip is too small. I have to literally cram the player into it. Third and lastly, the the sound quality is so so, the thing feels flimsy, the headphone wire is too short and the software is the slow.On the other hand, it is very affordable and works pretty well. Buy it if you want a [low cost] MP3 player that performs OK."
2,Very poor cusomer service.,After first receiving this item I gave it a fairly good review. However that was before I tried to contact customer service at Samsung. Let's just put it this way I will avoid buying Samsung products in the future. As the saying goes products are only as good as the company that stands behind the merchandise. I would look at MP3 players from other manufacturers.
5,The Perfect Gift,"I purchased this MP3 player for my friends birthday, and he really loved it. It was such a good deal, only 45$ and the perfect example of new music technolagy. He carries it everywhere, in his smallest pocket, and is able to listen to over 100 hours of any songs on the web. Now thats a real deal. Listening to the best artists in the world from a 2-ounce device. Yepp has perfected music."
5,Great Player,"I already own one of this players. It has been great! Sound quality is excellent. The only thing that doesnt work its the belt clip, but its so small that it fits well in my pocket, so its not a big deal! Great price and just what i needed."
2,"Don't waste your time on swapping files, get a CD\MP3!","At first, please be aware that it will NOT work with 128M SmartMedia.Got one last November, and it did work. The problem is the speed of deleting old files and uploading new files are very very slow (20~30minutes for my 32M internal + 64M SM Card), which makes the task of swapping your songs into this player for listening a torture. From my own experiences, I suggest everyone buy a CD/MP3 player instead. By the way, This device is supported by RealJukebox but not by RealONE, maybe because it get discontinued.Another unpleasant thing: the ""hold"" key on the body got malfunction shortly after purchase and I could not use the buttons on the body anymore."
1,A very poor reproduction of the original music,"None of the songs are in their original form. The typical 'shrill' associated with the western themes is completely absent. Especially the the 'good, bad, ugly' composition is extremely poor."
5,great,One of the greatest albums of country music ever produced. I have used this album for several events and it is just as inspiring today as when it was first recorded.It is a pity it is no longer available. Well done EMI.
1,BEWARE THE BATTERY PACK!,"While the Thin Amp is great and portable, beware the battery pack, which is inside a sealed container. Open it up and you'll find a lead-acid battery with the warning: ""DO NOT CHARGE IN A SEALED CONTAINER""Lead-acid batteries, when being charged, produce highly explosive hydrogen gas. While the amount of hydrogen produced is much smaller than from an auto battery, there is still some danger. I really expected to see a series of Ni-cad or similar cells inside, not a miniature car battery. I wonder if AXL even knew this is what they were getting."
4,"Fun, Creative and full of useful advise","Relationships require hard and constant work. This book provides the reader with useful information that men and women both can use to better their relationships.The book offers many ideas for telling your husband or wife how much you love them, how much they mean to you and it gives you some fun and creative ways that all of us can use from time to time.Lots of the tips and information found in this book is common sense, but there's still alot of information a person can gather here. I recommend this book to all people, especially couples."
1,Terrible,"I'm not really an uptight person about christian written material, but this book is way over the top. I can't believe this book was written in the 1980's. This book is a complete insult to women. One excerpt read something like...Make sure to look your best in the morning when he leaves for work. You want to make sure his last glimpse of you is better than his secretary.Come on...this is a big leap backwards for women and this book should be burned."
1,Cavewomen were more liberated than this one!!!,I thought her kind was extinct. It would be funny if it wasn't for the possibility that one of your children falls in love with one of hers. This book is the antithesis of self-respect.
4,Perfect Fit,"This door seal was a perfect fit for my 78 F250. Be aware, though, you will need to buy a weatherstrip adhesive either online or from your local parts store. This is not just a snap-on fit.My only complaint is that the product description does not say whether this roll is for one door or two. I'll have to order another one now, as this only fits one door.Otherwise, great product!"
1,library cd???? Hot stuff?????,"I received this CD in a timely fashion which was swell. But....why was the CD stamped in multiple places the property of some library. Bad form pal, it would have been nice if you offered an explanation."
3,"Beautiful bar stools, but...","I bought three of these stools and they look great. However, first of all these are made in china & was not clear in description. I prefer to not buy chinese furniture. 2nd, all three chairs dont sit flat on the floor. We used felt pads to level the stools. One was OK, two were bad so it wasnt my assembly technique, i have done alot of IKEA type allen key assembled furniture. One hole was stripped. Bottom line is they look good but as for long term, I dont know if they will hold up because they are really sitting on three of four legs. I suggest buying allen key set with ""t"" handles for this kind of work. that silly little allen key they provide kills your fingers. All that said, $132 each with free shipping and no sales tax? Gotta love that. Reference price i think is B.S. because a $600 stool would not need to be assembled and would not wobble."
3,Disappointing ending,"The first two-thirds of this book are very good - interesting characters, interesting story, and lots of twists. The last third is very disappointing. The book suddenly takes off into science fiction territory, and the conclusion is wishy-washy and unsatisfying."
2,Miscatalogued,I was disappointed in this book. I'm a keen reader of Science Fiction but I bought 'Coincidence' because it was in the Crime/Suspense section and I was expecting an edge-of-the-seat book of the Harlan Coben type. I felt quite misled and the ending was a huge letdown.
3,OK but not spectuacular,"I was introduced to the author by his book Superstition, which I really enjoyed 99% of the way through. Like so many paranormal-type books, the ending sort of peters out.This was certainly a different type of book, and it keeps you guessing as to what is really happening (actually it's a question that is never really answered.) Once the major plot twist is sprung I sort of lost interest, although the writing is such that I never considered not finishing it. (The short side-trips into philosophical territory of synchronicity were a little trying after a while, though.)Not a glowing recommendation, but it was an okay light read if you want something a little different."
3,Chirping crickets and a body on the porch,"Rich characters and setting are enriched by, well... rich writing and imagery, which only occasionally becomes a bit too flowery and overly descriptive. I enjoyed being dropped into an area of this country not done to death in other stories; the Georgia Appalachian region is a very interesting place. The mystery story itself is pretty good; like a lot of good mysteries, the story effectively ties the mystery story into the history and dark secrets of the story's setting. The diverse characters and the colorful banter between them are also very enjoyable."
4,Interesting ... different,"Not a lot of mystery, more atmosphere and character, rather different and definitely not my usual type of thing. There were a lot of things I enjoyed about it and a few that more or less left me frowning and shaking my head. Good, vivid characters and lush, almost poetic description of the setting, which works well for the locality. Sometimes more description than I really wanted or needed.A lot of backstory, a lot of folklore information, a real sense of the rural Appalachian communities and people, interesting characters.Not fast paced, not a lot of tension but an interesting read."
4,The Devil's Hearth,This book introduces Fever Devlin who is a prof. at an university in Georgia. This is a unique book as it is not the usual formula type mystery. This story takes place in Appalachia. Depoy want us not to forget the type of life that exists there. He reminds us of the importance of folk tales. Fever gets together with two other guys to find out who killed his half brother. It is a different story and I plan to read the next book in the series when I find the time.
4,Loved the Folktales,"If you like folklore, this is a book for you. History is written from the stories or folktales told from generation to generation. Sometimes as is human nature the tale is twisted to serve the needs of the story teller and the truth gets blurred.Set a murder mystery in the Georgia Appalachians and you get a colorful and fascinating story. Just the main character's name draws you in, Fever Devlin. DePoy makes us realize how many sub cultures there are in America. An intriguing read."
2,A Most Tedious Tale,"This story offers many challenges to those who would read it. The opening pages are turgid with inconsequential prose. You may enjoy it if you can get past the first 50 pages. I didn't, for lack of energy."
2,Deadly Dull,"Combine these elements: a murder mystery, folk music, folklore, and an idyllic setting in the beautiful Appalachian Mountains. How could this book not be a winner? Phillip Depoy manages to take an interesting plot, and from it create a totally boring novel. The higher the body count, the bigger the yawns."
5,My husband loved this CD,"Great CD, would recommend it. My husband loved the CD. It came fast. I had no problem with either the store or product."
1,poor print quality,"This book is available on google books for free, so look there first. This print edition is ridiculously overpriced for the print quality; much of the print is barely legible or not at all. The book itself has valuable information for genealogists with ancestors in Kittery, Maine, but find another edition."
1,"Terrible performance, terrible customer service","I needed to expand my office system to use two monitors for the purpose of client education.I tried two of these cards, thinking the first one was defective. I am using one 17"" monitor and one 21"" monitor. All settings were properly made and all other graphics/video drivers removed. All resolutions are within the printed capabilites of the card.The card leaves a significant artifact on the screen. Specifically, the card leaves streaks and patterns of missing pixels on both of the screens.As I write this, I have been on hold with the ""award winning"" customer service for a collective 36 minutes - still with no answer.It appears that I will have to dump the card and start from scratch.This was a huge waste of time and effort."
1,Terrible product - follow up,"After a collective 1 hour on the phone, it was revealed that BFG actually knows about the artifacting problem. In this case, it was significant enough to where it was necessary to return the second video card (mentioned in part I of this review).Customer service is horrible. It finally took a collective 42 minutes to get through. Once through the ""agent"" was disinterested and misinformed.Great product if you're looking for aggravation."
1,Not work !,"Want to use this product ? Forget it ... No company web site, No server for their software, No support and No information what is going on with Dingotel company !!!Very disappointed !!"
1,Company is gone! This product WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE!!,Just putting this up to reinforce the other review stating the same info. DO NOT BUY THESE! I just ordered from Cabella's without looking here first. Wish I would have looked at Amazon reviews as I usually do and I would have saved some time and effort!
3,only half,Well the concept is great. Linking distant radio repeaters together via the internet. I think this would be a great assett for Search Rescue and disaster relief work. As long as you have infastructure. HOWEVER you need to be somewhat techie--I was NOT able to make it work -stright from the box--.
1,No support and not what I expected,"No support. All emails to support unanswered. Is dingotel even in business anymore? Their digital certificates authenticating dingotel via SSL seem to have all expired. I prepaid some money for the +dail option to terminate calls to landlines, but the dialer does not work. Not pleased at all, and out of patience with the product. I would like my money back"
4,"Good, but not necessarily for the zodiac","This is the first book I've found that attempts to link possible interpretations of archealogical finds with the myths and foreign commentary of the Celts. It is a bit difficult to follow, but it certainly had me thinking in a new way."
2,interesting theory but too hard to read,"First, one should note that by ""zodiac"" the author is decidedly not referring to an astrological system devised by the Druids. This is a book on the cosmogenic ( pertaining to the branch of astronomy dealing with the origin and history and structure and dynamics of the universe) beliefs of the Druids. The author uses the Gundestrap cauldron and Coligny Calendar as his archaeological template for his theory and this seemed a fascinating enough premise when I picked up the book. However learned the author is, though, some of the arguments are so interrelated, going from point A to B to C, etc., that I was often lost at the connections. It was with great reluctance I abandoned this book 2/3 of the way through. I wanted to like this book, I really did. There is something romantic about the notion that I could look at constellations just a little like the Druids might have, but the read was too thick to churn through to find the answers."
5,Congratulations!,"Firstly, I was told David Taylor has participated in the development of APS and ERP projects which I could observe upon reading his book. It is therefore expected that he would put a certain emphasis on issues concerning those subjects. However, he covers other issues which are related to the supply chain management (SCM) itself. Mr. Taylor also looks into the main subjects of the logistics area. Actually, SCM and logistics management are strongly correlated in the sense that SCM is a broader concept that incorporates all concepts of the logistics management.In my understanding, the above book is very useful for the ones interested in having an insight as for the underlying ERP philosophy. At least, I myself have got better understanding of ERP uses applicable to SCM. Congratulations on your very good work, Mr. Taylor!"
4,Warm-hearted renditions,"For fans of Menhuin, this recording is a must. While there are many delightful recordings of the Brandenburgs, few come as inexpensively as this one (the set by Schwarz on this label is less satisfying), and as satisfying.The sound is a little dry, which can seem to over-emphasize slight blemishes in ensemble. However, a small price to pay for joyful performances, with Menhuin's elegant (if sometimes less than perfect) playing. I especially enjoy numbers 1, 2, and 6 on these discs. If you are unfamiliar with these works, these discs make a fine introduction."
4,Poor Shipping,"This vaccuum was badly damaged when it arrived at my house.It still worked,but I could not give it to my daughter as a gift.I could not repackage it back to you in time,so I kept it and bought another one just like it at Lowes Home And Ganden Center.The front of the vaccuum was cracked ,as was the tool holder broken off.It looked like it had been dropped.My daughter likes the replacement,but the one I bought from you sits in the closet unused."
2,Not just like @home,I ordered this modem because of the review I read that said it worked great. So far all problems point to the modem. 3com website is very vague and doesn't really support the 3CR29210. It must have been a 3Com employee that posted the review trying to unload these thing. I'm still trying to resolve the issue with attbi.com support.
1,Does not work with ATT Broadband,"In reading the reviews I thought this modem would work with ATT. Apparently, it used to before they switched to a different type of system. The ATT technician said it does not work with ATT and suggested I buy a Motorola modem."
1,If you are using ATTBI.COM do not buy!!,This modem is on DOCSIS 1.0 and ATTBI.COM is on DOCSIS 1.1. If you use this modem with ATTBI you will only get about 10% of your bandwith. Im trying to get the firmware upgraded on this but Im getting the run around between ATTBI and 3com
1,Don't Buy this Modem!,"This modem is NOT DOCSYS compliant and will NOT work with AT&T; cable service. 3Com Tech support, (which doesn't have a toll free number) describes a 'secret' web site that AT&T; can go to get a frimware upgrade that this modem requires. AT&T; tech support, after several calls and several technicians, all say that 3Com is giving me misinformation. Several people, in fact all that i spoke with at AT&T;, said that the 3Com modems are junk and strongly (yet unofficially) advise ANY other brand of cable modem. Some also added that 3Com's other network gear is no longer a qulity purchase.All told, I spent (money) on the modem, ... dollars calling tech support at 3Com, and (money) on a service visit from AT&T; to tell me that my 3Com modem doesnt work. On top of all of those costs, 3com wanted me to pay for the shipping to send it back for a refurbished modem. I cut my losses and purchased a Motorola instead."
3,Be cautious: model line discontinued.,"I have used a 3Com ISDN LAN modem for years with no problem, but when I looked at this one, I found it was not compatible with my cable system and was part of the 3Com home product line that has been discontinued. I think that means upgrades to the firmware are unlikely and that overall the support will be a negative."
1,Not compatible with @home in Baton Rouge area,"This may be a fine modem, but make sure you check with your cable provider--preferably by checking their online listing--as I was informed incorrectly by one of the @home techs that it was compatible. It did look nice and is well constructed, but of no help to me."
3,Not for Comcast in DC Metro,I just got off the phone with Comcast help desk and finally (after 4 days) they determined that they DO NOT support the 3CR29210 or 3CR29220 models. So I have a doorstop! ASK FIRST for assurance that it IS supported!
2,Another headache,"I ordered the 3com 3cr29210 after checking with the tech support people at Mediacom, (formerly @home), who assured me that any modem would work as long as it was docsis compliant (which this model is - supposedly). However, when I connected the modem and computer through the USB ports as instructed, there was no Internet (Windows XP didn't recognize the device). Strangely, when I connected my computer and the device via an ethernet adapter, it worked great. The only problem is that I need to return the adapter with the my previous modem in order to stop the excessive [money] monthly rental fee, which is the whole point of this endeavor. Now I am shopping for ethernet adapters on ebay, a little confused about the whole issue."
1,Service incompatibility,"Charter Communications is my provider and they were not able to get this modem to work with their service. They said they had problems with the Office connect. I also called 3Com a and that didn't help either, everyone was helpful but check the service compatibility list of modems before ordering this one."
1,Modem Failure,I purchased this modem in late February of this year and it failed last week. The cable company (suscom) provided me with a rental modem which I'm currently using. Is the 3Com modem covered by warranty for this period of usage?
1,Incompatible with Cox Communications,"Despite whatever anyone tells you, Cox Communications, Cox@Home, and the Road Runner HSI service no longer support 3Com cable modems. Beware and be careful."
3,3Com Office Connect,"Nice product, I can't say enough about the history of the company or the overall quality of their products. This modem has all the features and performance you will likely need. I do not however recomend it as 3Com has very nicely discontinued support for this modem. This includes any future firmware upgrades including upgrades to Docsis 1.1 other than no support on their website and no upgrades a pretty stable/good product."
1,No biblical basis to this book,"Supposedly this book explains how to become 'free'. However, Dr. Anderson neglects to mention that through Christ we are already free. No works involved. Just a free gift from God. One of the premises of the book is that Christians can become demon possessed. I have never found any biblical basis for this train of thought. To believe what is said in this book you would have to believe that Christians can be possessed. This book uses fear to pressure people into thinking there is some kind of 'formula' to gain a 'higher level' of freedom. The bible teaches a simple message of grace which is commit your life to Christ(Romans 10:9&10)and freedom in Christ is a gift of God. Through salvation we are saved from all that would separate us from God. This book has a 'works based' philosophy--sounds allot like the requirements of the pharisees."
1,The Bondage Breaker Audiobook,"The CD was ordered in September, but I didn't get a chance to listen to it till December and find the 2nd CD is messed up. I was wanting to get a replacement item but see that the date for return on this item expired November 1st. There seems to be no way to contact Amazon via email or phone to ask for help."
1,The Bondage Breaker Overcoming *Negative Thoughts *Irrational Feelings,"I never received this book, payment was deducted from my checking account, but the book was never delivered to my home address.Seller: Kings Ridge Media"
5,You Can Know How much Christ loves You,"This book is all about coming to grips with the love of Christ. As we learn how much Jesus loves us, everything else in life will become less significant i.e rejection, hurtful words that have been spoken to you etc."
5,"excellent, must read for every christian, applies to every christian newby and seasoned alike","i HAVE READ ALMOST ALL ANDERSONS BOOKS, THE FIRST BEFORE THIS IS VICTORY OVER THE DARKNESS. THAT BOOK CHANGED MY THINKING ON EVERYTHING FROM MY SELF WORTH, WHO i AM IN CHRIST, HOW VALUABLE I AM IN CHRIST, TO WHY I AM AFRAID TO BE BOLD FOR GOD. THIS BOOK THE BONDAGE BREAKER GETS DOWN TO THE REASONS HOLDING YOU BACK, THE LIES YOU HAVE ACCEPTED ABOUT YOURSELF, CLARIFIES HOW STRONG YOU REALLY ARE IN CHRIST AND GETS YOU GOING ONTO LIVING A FRUIT FILLED LIFE IN CHRIST. IT GETS ""THE MONKEY OFF YOUR BACK, FOREVER"" A MUST READ FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN."
4,Eye-Opening. A must read for every growing Christian,"This book enlightened me to the ""war"" on for my mind and thoughts and how my past actions (done in ignorance) may be blocking my spiritual growth today. I highly recommend it."
5,Great for New Believers!,"I recommended strongly for new believers. This is a good book to lay a solid foundation with. It is a great tool in getting new believers 'minds renewed'. They have to start thinking different and get free from the strongholds in their minds before they can start to grow. This is a good crawl, walk, run foundation to start with."
3,Some good insight regardless of whether you agree,"Your denomination may or may not teach, and/or you may or may not believe, that demons have any power over us today. As I understand the Bible, demons could reside within people during the first century, but it's not clear to me whether that's still the case today.Regardless, Anderson gives some good practical advice to help you overcome sinful habits. All of that advice boils down to learning and embracing the truth. Whether it's Satan whispering lies into your ears or you lying to yourself, when you recognize those lies, you can (with effort) choose to stop listening to them. When you stop listening to lies and instead listen to truth, your actions will change for the better."
4,Really Helpful,I've never been a fan of people who scare Christian's into believing that Satan is behind everything in the universe. I felt that Anderson did a good job establishing the role of the devil and how we can break those bonds without trying to frighten readers into submission. Very glad this was on audio book for my husband! He loved it and listened to it multiple times. It has been incredibly helpful for him and his journey.
5,The Bondage Breaker,"In the last few weeks, I've read ""Victory Over Darkness"" and ""The Bondage Breaker"" by Neil T. Anderson. Both books are excellent, especially ""The Bondage Breaker."" At the back of the book are seven steps to experiencing freedom in Christ.I thought I was living a free life. But I also knew some blockage remained from negative experiences because I had stifled all corresponding emotions. Oh my goodness, what a wonderful release to walk through every bit of the past, renounce any hold the enemy may have kept in those areas, and give them to God to totally experience His freedom. I would highly recommend purchasing ""The Bondage Breaker."""
5,Read this!,"I would recommend this book to anyone. If possible, read Neil Anderson's ""Victory over Darkness"" first."
2,Falters after a Good Foundational Start,"This book starts with a wonderful introduction, describing our position in Christ- something that is so foundational to our fight against the evil one. I admit that there is much good in this bok, but it is tangled up with so much questionable stuff. Overall, it goes downhill, confusing many issues such as demon oppression/possesion of the Christian/non- Christian. There is a lot of poor exegesis here as he proof-texts his way into showing that Christ has given us all of his authority over Satan (Amoung many other things, most are wrong!). Also, the whole idea of having to pray an individual prayer for freedom from individual sins sounds a too much like a magical spell book! ... should be read after Powlison's excellent book, Power Encounters."
2,Gives Satan too Much Power,"The author states ""it is my observation that no more than 15% of the evangelical community is completely free from Satan's bondage."" Satan is seen as an omnipresent force ready to invade Christians when they sin. The book uses case studies for support. In one case, a woman is demonized after praying that God would give her thorn in the flesh if that's what it took for His power to be perfected in her weakness. After the prayer, she experienced tingling sensations which the author concluded were due to invading demonic forces. Following a deliverance prayer, her symptoms were relieved. The point of the passage is that a sovereign God sent the messenger of Satan for a positive spiritual purpose in Paul's life and He refused to remove it. Anyone who has read this book should also read a dissenting evangelical perspective (e.g., The Stronghold of Grace which discusses the placebo effect in symptom relief) and make up their own minds."
1,"at times unbiblical and troubling, Neil needs a bible review","This book may help some people, but mislead and hurt others. A flag should go up when Neil claims to be ""bitten"" by a demon, which is not possible to saved believers. And the unbiblical concept of binding which he gets from verses that having nothing to do with spirtual warfare. We could also discuss his beliefs in the mythical ""incubi"" etc. People are so in love with his books that they don't bother to take a critical look at them, and Neil doesn't care about scholarship. Some of his ideas amount to being spells, but then again he believes in curses so what do you expect?"
2,A Demon Under Every Bush,"Dr. Anderson presents a less than compelling argument that much mental illness and psychological burdens is demonic in nature. This is not to suggest that it can NEVER be a spiritual problem, but rather that it is not the problem as frequently as he suggests. He gives anecdotal evidence based upon his counseling sessions which appears to be more hypnotic suggestion than examples of spiritual warfare.The two killers for me with this book were the Scripture wrested from its original context, and the chapter-by-chapter advertisements for his other books to those readers who wanted to go deeper.It is also perhaps very telling that no one who is anyone endorsed this book or offered to write the preface for him."
1,huh,"I bought it bu dont recall reading it, so I guess it was a dud,I cannot recall any of it so it went right into goodwill bin,,"
1,Scary book,"I have been through a year and a half of pastoral counseling for a mental disorder as well as secular psychotherapy. I thought buying this book would give me a spiritual perspective on how to deal with my mental disorder but instead it scared me. Anderson talks about people with mental disorders as possessed by demons. In his chapter on how to treat your disorder he has the reader recite prayers that deal with evil spirits and demonic possessions. He also believes that relaxation practices such as yoga are evil. I am a very spiritual person and get my strength from God, but not in this way. I do not believe that I am possessed by demons or under the influence of demons and I certainly do not want to think of my mental disorder as being that way. This is a book I would never want to read again, and wished I had never purchased."
1,Saved Christians cannot be demon possessed,".................... I find it disturbing that Neil claims tohave been bitten by a demon! Saved Christians cannot be attacked by satan! Neil aim's this work at people who have mental problems, recovering alcoholics and anyone else who have trouble accepting Christ's grace. I am one of those who when a new Christian and a recovering alcoholic, had trouble believing that God would have anything to do with me. The steps to freedom led to bondage. Please seek out more experienced people than me to get a work of warning from. .....................God Bless"
1,A big disappointment,"After seeing some of the raving customer reviews here at Amazon, I thought this book would be a great one. However, this book was a big disappointment. I do believe that demons do exist, however, the author seems to believe that you are possessed by demons galore and any and all of your problems come from them. The cure for any malady is apparently to exorcise the demon responsible. However there is little, if any mention of self-responsibility here. The author shows total ignorance of even the most basic concepts of psychology or mental illnesses. After gritting my teeth to get through this book, I threw it in the trash--the only appropriate ""library"" for a book like this."
5,awesome book,This book addresses a class of core issues relaed growth as a Christian. Neil's scriptural grounding along with his practical experience in the areana of binding vices and direct spiritual influences are a must have addition to any well rounded dicipleship program.
4,"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. John 8:32","Good, Biblical teaching in this book. I also recommend Joyce Meyer ""Battlefield of the Mind"" as well. For any Christian struggling with self-defeating thoughts both books are excellent. The best teaching I found on this subject is Kenneth E. Hagin Sr. ""The Believer's Authority""."
4,Can't get this one song out of my mind!!,"If you are a Babyface fan then you really need to get this album. It shows you his true start in the industry. The one song in particular that sticks with me is ""Crazy about you"". I remember at 13 playing that song over and over again on my record player (yes I did say record) and wearing it out. Imagine how I felt when someone scratched it up. This album has been the one true record that I've wanted since then but have not been able to find it. It must be popular because Amazon has it out of stock also!"
5,Best webcam for the price,"I bought this webcam based on other reviews and am SOO glad I spent the extra $20. I'm not sure of the picture quality of the cheaper one I was considering, but this the image quality is spectacular. The colors and image are crisp. And it is seriously a plug and play item. I would recommend that all mac users get this webcam (because there isn't much on the market). I'm sure the isight is nice, but it's way too expensive when I can have excellent quality in a cheaper device. I'm sure it's the best webcam for pc users, as well, with no need for drivers. I absolutely love this webcam."
3,does not work directly on Mac MSG,"i thought i should just plug and play in a Mac, but you will read in the manual that it works on yahoo msg ... i bought it for Mac & MSG and now use it in PC & MSG."
4,This is a great camera for MAC users!,"I just purchased this camera and I was wonderfully pleased with how easy it was to set up. Minimal instructions that amount to downloading a image testing application from the makers website. It took me all of 5 minutes. My parents and I both bought webcams since I am away at school as a way to talk. I am a Mac user and they have a PC. We tested it and while they spent way more money on their webcam, mine at almost 1/2 the cost has a better image quality. I would definiately recommend this camera. But getting a headset with microphone is a good suggestion if you want better quality sound."
4,the only option for mac - therefore nice,"very easy to install, drawback is the bottom of the camera which is very visible once you turn it down to a certain degree"
3,A nifty little machine,"I had to get this because Apple doesn't make the video camera anymore. It works fine, but you need an external mike."
4,ECAMM Great for Mac or Windows,I'm currently in Iraq and it is hard to find a webcam that works with Mac. This cam was a great price and has a great picture. I would recommend that cam to anyone.
3,Ecamm,Works really well for the price. Have to adjust the color every time we use it. But like it.Its agood value.
4,"Good cam, not the highest quality but good when options are limited","If you are one of the poor souls who has a mac that predates built in isight cameras and you don't wanna pay upwards of $150 for a real isight on ebay then this is for you. The cam works with your computer, requires no drivers and automatically syncs with programs like ichat and skype. It will even mount on top of your ibook or powerbook. However, since it is a USB cam and the transfer rate of USB is rather slow the picture quality isn't that high but its better than nothing."
2,Doesn't Work with Mac OS 10.6.4,"These are nifty little USB cameras for the Mac -- not the best quality, but fine for the price.However, 10.6.4 broke everything and these cams no longer work with any software -- iChat, Evocam, Periscope, even iMage's own tester. And the company is very slow to respond to problems.Avoid until they sort it all out."
5,MUST read for the new homeschooler!,"We will be starting homeschooling in June of 2001. I have read no less than 7 books on this topic and this one stands out amongst the others. It is so informative, it answered all of my questions and then some. It gives very specific information on the different ""styles"" of homeschooling, loads of resources, and best of all you get to read about real homeschooling families, how they do things and why. The author does write with obvious favor to her own schooling method of choice, but not nearly as overtly as others I've read. If you are considering homeshcooling, then read this book before any others."
3,it really is for beginners only,"There isn't much content in here that someone who has been homeschooling for a year or more doesn't already know, but it could be useful for a parent just starting out. One thing to keep in mind if you are currently considering a purchase is that much of what the author advises is *really* out of date for the contemporary homeschooler. For example, she strongly encourages that you attend a homeschool conference and join a group like HSLDA, advice that was more helpful ten years ago when the book was written. If you are new to homeschooling, this book isn't worthless, but make sure you read more up-to-date stuff as well, like homeschooling magazine & internet content."
5,Great Info for Those Thinking of Homeschooling,"This is a wonderful book! I wish I'd had it two years ago when we were just beginning to consider Homeschooling. I think this would be the perfect book to start with for anyone who is curious about Homeschooling or is just beginning to look into it. This is also the book I'm going to give to all of my child's Grandparents to try to help them understand it better.While this is an excellent book for ""beginners"", this book was also very useful to me even though I knew a lot about Homeschooling already. I still got a bunch of good info and inspiration from this book. I REALLY enjoyed it and I think I'll probably refer back to it for years to come."
5,Great Starter Book,"This is an excellent place to start when you first being to consider the option of homeschooling. It offers a wealth information on where to start and issues to consider. It covers a lot of the startup issues you need know abut, how to integrate it into your own life and lots of brief stories from real people are used to illuminate whatever topic is being covered in that section. I particularly liked the section that covered the issues and concerns people might have about socialization for kids are homeschooled.In many ways, it accomplishes what the ""Dummies..."" and ""Idiots..."" series books do...but with an intelligent, competent and professional style."
4,very helpful,"I love this book, I reread it from time to time to give me that extra motivation and encouragement I need. It talks about things you wouldn't normally even think about, but it's nice to have a book to go to when you need a few answers"
1,very dissapionted!,I have been looking into homeschooling my children and thought this might be a helpful resource. It started out fine but the author really started pushing the Unschooling method instead of giving a balanced view of all options. I was hoping for a helpful book--but it's not.
3,Helpful,I wouldsay it is nice to know what others are doing and the different types of homeschooling that is out there but it does depend on the laws of your state.
2,Not as good as the orginal,"I have twelve, yes twelve, cats. I know, we're certifiable.Anyway, with the recent addition of five kittens and their formerly homeless mom, all the older cats have their noses out of joint. We've got territorial marking,spiteful peeing, you name it. I bought a gallon of the Nature's Miracle Orange Oxy because the original NM always worked pretty well and I hoped the ""orange"" part would help discourage future visits by disgruntled cats.The Orange Oxy doesn't seem to kill the odor nearly as well as the original NM, and it leaves the surfaces with sort of a sticky/slippery residue that's really unpleasant. (I've tried it on both carpet and laminate floors.) After trying the Orange Oxy a couple of times I bought a gallon of NM original and went back to using that."
3,Decent body fat tape measure,"It definitely does its job. My only complaint is that it comes with no instructions. With other Gulicks that I have had in the past, they had the spring with two balls in the tube and it was pretty easy to identify when your tension was correct. This one, however, has a rod going into a solid metal cylinder. The rod has a notch in it, after it has pulled out of the cylinder about 1/4 inch, and I had to assume that the notch serves as the marker for proper tension. The notch is difficult to see though and therefore makes this Gulick harder to use than the previous model that I am used to.Overall: I would look for the Gulick with the other type of tension indicator, though this one will certainly serve to give you fairly accurate readings."
1,not what I expected,I was very disappointed in the quality of this book. I have bought many used books from this site. When it arrived I opened it and found candy stuck between the pages. There were also a few piece of mail and a fair amount of writing on the pages.
5,How to live better today,"John Maxwell wrote a power packed book on Why today matters and how to live better today so that tomorrow will be better than yesterday. Any person who is looking to grow in any area of life will be challenged, inspired and motivated to make some today changes. At the end of each chapter John gives clear guidance on how to implement what was written. The ending is awesome. The chapter on Growth was very inspiring. 12 things that matter today: Attitude, Priorities, Health, Family, Thinking, Commitment, Finances, Faith, Relationships, Generosity, Values, Growth. The best quote ever: ""Yesterday ended at midnight, today is worth 2 tomorrow's."" Awesome Book."
3,"Same Stuff, Different Title","Reading these books are like listening to music written by the same artist, after a while, it all starts to sound the same. If you have read one, you have read them all! Rehashed material!"
5,Today Matters and Tomorrow's Leaders,"I have been searching for a book to use in a Summer Youth Leadership Development Workshop Series at my church and this works! John Maxwell's office made this recommendation for me along with three other books that would be appropriate for teenagers and I totally agree. I'm looking forward to helping our youth have ""GREAT DAYS"" built on the strong foundations that they receive from many sources including Today Matters."
5,Excellent!,This book is quite an eye opener. It has really been a pleasure to read this book and apply the principles in my life. I really have seen and felt a difference in my life since reading this book.
2,Overtly Generic.,"If you have read any famous success books, such as Think and Grow Rich or Millionaire Fastlane, you will be bored to death reading this book. It contains all the platitudes your parents and teachers told you growing up, and not much more.Nothing to write home about here."
2,new age crap,if this book didn't have quotes it would be a pamphlet. definitely not worth the price I paid for it
4,Good story teller !,"Hans von Luck happened to live the lives of several men, so it seems. He was at practically all the major scenes of the European WWII theatre. Von Luck tells his tale well and, despite the subject, with some humour. He has good philosophical thoughts. There were however a few things which annoyed and puzzled me a bit. Hans von Luck stays clear of more detailed descriptions of the fighting actions. He describes them in the same fashion as he describes his visits to his friends in Paris.A bit casual and cool, as if fighting in sub sub sub zero temperasture in Russia is not worth much more description than the casual remark about the purchase of wine. He keeps his distance and stays cool. As he is always an officer and a gentleman he gets more and more a one-dimensional, fictional, person. In the end I wondered whether it were memoires or a bad screenplay. Albeit this, the book is highly recommendable for an insight in the German army."
4,A fine book by a fine soldier,"I have just about finished reading this book, but I feel that it is one of the best books on war memoirs that I have ever read (although admittedly I haven't read that many). Hans von Luck takes us through his experiences with the calm detachment of one who is at peace with himself and has come to terms with the many harsh circumstances in which he found himself. There isn't any gory detail or horrifying imagery to this work, so blood-and-death fans would probably be bored with it, but I find that it's a fascinating account form the 'other' side. It would be hard to find another soldier who had the breadth of experiences that Hans von Luck had, or had met the number of important people, for example Rommel, vom Manteufel, Jodl, Kesselring etc. as he did. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in stories of WWII."
5,Brought Tears to my eyes,"What can I say about this soldier? Well, he fought in the Second World War.What can I say about this book? It's Hans Von Luck's memoir.I don't think there's more to say.This man led his men with great determination and utter perseverance. Even if the war was going to a slump, Von Luck was unwilling to give up. It tells the story of a real man who lived thru hell. From the early victories of wine and prosperity to the last days of death and destruction, this man had seen it all...Von Luck is a greatly respected man notably the Desert Fox (aka Rommel) and the American historian Stephen Ambrose. He has played a distinguished role to foil the British's ""Operation Goodwood"" and he is mentioned in many books such as ""Steel Inferno"" and ""Six Armies in Normandy"".It's one of those books, which brings tears to your eyes.~Shc~"
5,The human side of war,"I found this book to be similar to stories told to me long ago by a member of the panzerwaffe whose fate was almost identical. The book itself is more of a human perspective and greatly omits the horrors surrounding a mechanized war fought in the blazing deserts of Africa and the snow blasted plains of Russia. The book underscores how one can get caught up in duty and have their whole life changed. It was interesting, enjoyable, humorous and shows that sometimes the only way through a terrible ordeal is with dedication to duty and a good sense of humor. I salute Heer Von Luck for many hours of enjoyment. It brought me back to a time when I was a child sitting listening to war stories told by one of his commrades."
2,Did the car survive?,"Here is a book from the German viewpoint by a professionalsoldier without the usual apologies. However, I was sorelydisappointed in this book. It is bland and completely devoid of any details regarding tactics, battles, relationships with his men, his fiance, etc. I do not dispute the Col. Luck was an exceptional soldier but his memoirs are very unexceptional. The prose is awkward and does not make for easy reading (may be lost in the translation). After while, I became more concerned with whether his Mercedes would withstand the travel from Germany to Poland to France to Russia to Germany again. I would pass this book by. END"
3,Panzer Commander's Non-Combat Memoirs,"I read this book hoping to get insight into why the German Panzer armies were so overpowering against their enemy. However the author rarely talks about military tactics or battlefield experience.The author fought on four of Germany's most famous battle fronts (Poland, Africa, Russia and Normandy). I was hoping to get insight on why the Pnzer army was so overpowering and how the German's had adjusted their Panzer tactics in the face of an enemy's increasing strength. Yet the author skims over these subjects and talks more about his personal experiences away from the battlefield.Hans Von Luck certainly has a wealth of war experience to share and his book is interesting reading. However with a title of ""PANZER COMMANDER"", I thought I would get more information about how the famous Panzer armies operated. This book did not provide such narratives."
2,tiny print,"This is likely a fine book. However, I need to use a magnifying glass to be able to read the tiny print. For $8 I hoped for a book with type a size I could read. The book, in this format, is not worth $8."
3,Very interesting but not for Military Historians,"This is a good book written by a protege of Rommels, as such he undertook tasks well above the rank he achieved. Hans was obviously a decent man and a brave and skilful leader (aka Rommel) and he was extremely lucky to survive the War. There is no discussion of tactics or strategy and the absence of any maps is a great disappointment. Many of us are familiar with the places of Europe but we got lost in the dessert!. Rodney Ross, Australia"
3,Interesting but not what I expected,"While Von Luck's memoirs are an interesting account of his experiences, and do provide key insights to such vital figures as Rommel, the descriptions of combat and the tactics used are lacking. The unexpected highlights of this memoir were his discussion of his relationship with his fiance and his experiences in Russia after the war, not his exploits as the commander of the Rommel's Reconaissance Battalion."
5,Can't be compared to any other book 5 STAR +++++++,"One of the best books I have read, Von Luck took me back in time and made me feel I was on his place. Most recommend it if you don't read this book you will never understand the war throught German commanders eyes"
2,"Tell the rest of the story, Hans.","Bells went off in my head when I saw that the introduction to this book was by Stephen Ambrose. A sure sign that little but dates and names would be learned. Against my better judgement I bought this book because there are so few memoirs of the war from the German side. This entire book amounted to little more than a travel memoir. The war actually sounded like a hell of a good camping trip. Mr. von Luck managed to reveal nothing of himself. Did he even see anyone die? Is there not one iota of anger in his skull? Is this guy human? Come on Hans, why did you hold back? History wants to know. If you want the antidote to this book, read Paul Fussell's ""Wartime""."
3,Somewhat Self Serving...,"Von Luck could have said something about the ""Comissar Order"" that meant the death (rightly or wrongly) of many men. He also choses to leave out the somewhat important fact that ""Barbarossa"" was implemented to destroy the Soviet Regieme and all who served it. In one part of the book he talks about finding coffee and sharing it with the whole camp. Where in Germany, cut off by Naval blockade, is he going to find coffee at the end of the war? I hope he didn't hurt his hand patting himself on the back. The fact he was a frontline soldier and survived well deserved captivity at the end of the war commands my respect. I feel he would have done better to write a little more objectively and a lot less than an enlightened personality. I feel a good B.S. detector is needed when reading this book. I do not reccomend it for Historians."
1,Terrible- dont buy it.,"Terrible book. I returned for a refund i was so disgusted. For a guy who was always at the spearhead, he describes the war as a road trip where he met interesting people. Combat isnt even discussed. Avoid at all costs."
1,Terrible. One of the worst military books I have read.,"This is a book about a guy patting himself on the shoulder, and showing how he was not like any other officers."
2,ridiculuously small book,"Alright...it's my fault, I did not notice the size of the book before ordering. This is a book about 1/2 the size of a pack of cigarettes. I read it cover to cover in a half an hour. Not worth the price, I threw it away."
1,"What is this book for, a fairy??","I bought this book for my dad as a Christmas gift and I'm now returning it because it's tiny! It fits in the palm of my hand! It's like 2x2 inches, completely small. I wouldn't even call this a book. No where on the page does it state this is a ""mini book"" and it should right in the title! Instead, if you happen to read the dimensions of books you're ordering (I know I don't!) then you'll see that it is indeed a tiny book. But who actually reads the dimensions of a book?? It's not necessary. So just beware. This book is TINY!"
4,Colorado Indie Horror That Delivers,"The Inner Room is a surprisingly good independent horror film. Shot in Colorado it revolves around the married couple of Julianne/Jules played by Jessica Duffy & Chris played by Marty Lindsey. The film is a ""box film"" meaning that it only takes place at the cabin and the woods surrounding it.Director Jack Gastelbondo creates a scary isolated film. The film does have faults including pauses in dialogue & some lighting problems. These are easily forgettable with a compelling, quick moving story with numerous twists.The Inner Room does deliver. It includes the mainstays of the horror genre of blood, sex & nudity. The blood is plentiful but not overdone. The ghosts are truly scary and unexpected.Colorado independent film continues to get stronger & stronger. This film has some indie flaws but still delivers. It also showcases the great work of Duffy & Lindsey, veterans of Colorado cinema."
2,Don't be fooled,"Just to add to the wealth of knowledge already poured into the past reviews (i.e. 'gooey' sounds), I would note that these performances are nothing more than a hasty interpretation pinned with a great name. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this CD is just a big conspiracy to raise money for the Seraphim company. If you want to listen to the master at his best, get his recording of the Beethoven and Mendelssohn violin concertos with Furtwangler and the BPO. If you want to hear the best recording available of the Bach concertos, listen to the Salvatore Accardo version with The Chamber Orchestra of Europe. But I digress...the sound quality on this CD is poor, with a muffled sound quality, the players have no sense of balance, and the tempo is too slow on every concerto. The same is true for the orchestral suites, so please, before you buy, realize you're getting what you pay for."
3,Dissapointing,"As I am doing research about this subject I found this one dissapointing. It's biased and often not well supported by facts or references. Still, I would recommend it to people interested in this subject, it at least gives an alternate view on many things."
5,BUY THIS CD!!!,"It's about time that an artist put together a collection of music that is a personal reflection on life. Enough of the grunge and depressing noise and welcome back meaningful lyrics and thoughtful music that comes from a man and a father, not a group of miserable teenagers. This CD has elements for all musical tastes and is sure to strike a chord in every listener. I have particular connections to Heart of a Man and Go On, but the entire CD is to be enjoyed. BUY THIS CD!"
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I hate when people call themselves owners of the truth. I hate that the modern Gurus are always trying to sell things and their time as if they were presidents of United States. This book is so simple, and the teachings from ordinary people like me are absolutely beautiful. Also I love Mr.Cohen foreword. I have always loved his books. Finally a book that points out where the real wisdom comes from in an affordable and heartfelt way!"
1,Exploring Tamil - Kids Learn Tamil,Exploring Tamil - Kids Learn TamilThis DVD is very poorly made. Its a ripoff for 14+ bucks. I have ordered a half a dozen DVD from india for [...] bucks each.I will not recommend anyone to buy any of the series by this author.
1,A big disappointment,"This DVD is very disappointing. It is very sloppily slapped together, with the background music and tamil voice-over poorly mixed, so that you can't hear the words properly. From some comments that I read, some of the words aren't ""proper"" tamil, but I can't judge, since I don't speak tamil, and I'm not sure that this is so critical. From a purely pedagogical point of view, I don't see how this DVD can be used. It is well-intentioned, I'm sure, but really too unprofessional to be considered an ""exploration"" of the language. Pity."
1,Kids learn tamil,We ordered this product with great enthusiasm however products did not fulfil our expectations. First of all many of the words used here are not even tamil words and not correct. These words are only used by Chennai Indians and not tamil words. This DVD will just confuse kids and parents.Either Amazon or Baby Einstein should remove this product from sale. This is not a real Baby Einstein product.
3,Filling the gap between High School and College,"Most of the primer covers what a student ought to have learned in high school History or social studies classes. Unfortunately, most high schools tend to neglect these basic concepts.Therefore the primer can prove helpful to the College Freshman dreading his or her World Civilization classes. Likewise, faculty could avoid many headaches and sighs by recommending this book for their courses.Covering the basics is indeed a dirty job, and someone had to do it. Anson is precise, topical and readable. A definite must-have for the College-bound student with a weakness in History or Social Science."
3,Printed fuzzy,"I really didn't want to pay for the oem ink. So I decided to buy this ink due to it's low price. Once it arrived I put it in the printer and printed the alignment page. It came out fuzzy, but scanned fine. I tried printing a picture with it and it didn't really show any fuzzyness. Printing with normal paper though, it did get fuzzy. For the price I think it was acceptable, but if I ever need to print something where detail was important I would buy original ink instead of refilled. It lasted less than original ink to. Not by much, but it did."
3,Absolute garbage!,"I only printed 10-15 pages and its fading like its about to run out of ink, I guess you don't get what you pay for, 5$ I want at least 20 pages what a joke! Stay away from this junk!UPDATED 1/28/2013Well it works now so I upgraded my review to 3 stars. Who knows how long though?"
3,HP 27 from Amazon,The item did not open and work in my machine. I will recycle to someone on whose machine it will work.
1,Didn't last long.,Purchased this 3 months ago and it is now running very low. Maybe 2 pages of text a month max and its already low. But its so cheap I knew it was a gamble. Definitely going to buy the HP next time.
4,Ink,My order was fast and the customer service was wonderful!!!!!!! I would recommend to anyone that is looking for cheap but decent or average ink cartridges.
5,worked for me,"i noticed the reviewers who gave it 1-2 stars, sucks it didn't work for them. i have been buying these for the past 2 years and they have been working just like the more expensive ones at cvs/walgreens. i always buy these since i save a lot more money."
2,1/3 failure rate,"I bought three from the same seller and tried all three on the same printer, 2 re-installs for each cartridge. One of the three cartridges failed every time, ie, barely any ink on the printout. The other two printed perfectly, although I don't know how many pages they last. I'm worried about the overall quality."
5,I Love Rookie Readers!,This is a great book to introduce the concept of continents to kids of all ages! It provides them with great content information and material that that students can actually practice reading!
1,A little disappointed...,"I was a little disappointed when I received this book. It is really, really for beginning learners. I realized it was for ""rookies"", when I ordered it--but didn't realize the contents per continent would be so elementary. The pictures and two-colored maps are really good - and I will still use this in my classroom, just not to the extent that I had intended."
2,Not enough content,This book is too simplified and id not meet my expectations for the price. It should add more details and explanations
1,ON WHAT CHART WERE THESE SONGS RATED?,I keep waiting for a good karaoke CD to come out with chart topping songs. This is not it.
1,words of wisdom,"First and foremost, I just want to say that my sole intentions are not to debunk this book, but to exercise my freedom of speech. It seems to me that this book is nothing but pure art, The only problems that have come with reading this epic, is the consist hearburn, and rash that I have developed, from touching this noval. Gaint ants, pizza, ""come on""! get with the program. Again, I am not debunking this book, but more work could have gone into it. So go ahead, and purchase the book. I think you will find it worth your while.yours trulystarchild"
1,One mans religious view disguised as a mind power book,What through the subject list appears to be a book on the power of the mind and how to harness it is simply the authors religious ideas spattered with quotes and misquotes from the bible.
4,A trans-Atlantic exploration of Portuguese culture,"As the millenium unfolds, Brazilian samba superstar Martinho Da Vila explores the positive side of European colonial expansion with a pleasant, not-too-glitzy outing that celebrates the Lusophone dance music of Cape Verde, Mozambique, Brazil and provinces far and wide... This has a hefty dose of West African highlife and Caribbean soca mixed in with Da Vila's standard samba sound, as well as lotsa guest musicians that I've never heard of (one assumes they are from Portugal, Guinea-Bissau and the other countries involved here). Cool concept, and one of Da Vila's nicest recent records. If you don't listen too closely, the glossier touches of pop production probably won't get in the way too much."
4,Concise History on the Lives of Two Great Men,"Hayward does a wonderful job in only 170 short pages of describing the similarites between Churchill and Reagan. It is a very quick read and will leave you feeling good about these two men and the accomplishments they achieved while in office.Hayward makes this statement, ""Greatness is ultimately a question of character: Good character does not change with the times: it has eternal qualities."" Are there any great leaders with character today? As in the lives of Churchill and Reagan, history will tell."
3,Interesting but not too relevant,"Steven Hayward extends his research of Churchill and Reagan to look at comparisons of leadership skills, styles and effectiveness. While the comparisons are interesting, I found it difficult to see the relevance. As a specific comparative analysis, the book brings forward otherwise obscure parallels in the life and times of these two great leaders. The title is misleading in that I found no insights on ""the making"" of an extraordinary leader. As a book on leadership, Mr. Hayward's work gives examples of Churchill and Reagan leadership, but the work doesn't analyze the leadership examples in a way that the reader could learn leadership tips.Overall, I found the book interesting, but not terribly relevant."
1,Why,"I have read this book and nothing in it strikes me as either great or extraordinary. I've noticed, however, that all negative reviews have been removed."
1,Raddis,Still havent recieved my first issue! I actually forgot I ordered it! thanks for the heads up Amazon. I will be looking into the purchase.
4,Useful guidance,I had done autogenic relaxation but never tried mindfulness meditations or body scans. I find both relaxing but difficult to truly focus. The recordings address those issues and guide you to continue to focus.
4,Interesting material ...,Quirky Japanese act runs the gamut from Bossa Nova to acid swing & kitschy pop. Features a take on Beck's 1996 hit 'New Pollution' - overall a highly amusing listen.
5,"""A hit out of the park""","This book grabs your attention from page one and dosen't disappoint. The vivid, colorful descriptions of the characters and places makes you feel like you are a part of the story. Having lived in the two cities in the book really brings the story to life for me. I feel this author hit one ""out the park"" for her debut novel."
2,The reader will be deceived,"As a group, we felt the book left the reader deceived along with a ton of unanswered questions. The group also felt that the author probably knew too much information about the surgery, which might have been a clue to the author's past. The group also debated the appropriateness of Toni revealing her previous gender to the men she chose to date. The group agreed that Toni has a responsibility of telling the men she anticipates having a committed relationship with and everyone else does not need to know. The group wondered how realistic it was for (married) Roger to openly date Devon when he is considering political office.How would you feel if your son came home with Toni and you found out that she used to be a man (Tony with a `y')???"
2,Blah.,"If you want a book like Terry Deary's Horrible Histories books, but completely lacking in wit and charm this is the book for you. My son loves Terry Deary's books so I bought this for him. He read it once and hated it. I also read it and was completely underwhelmed. Terry Deary's books are full of sharp British wit. This one was a pathetic attempt at copying his style. My advice, buy Terry Deary's Horrible Histories USA instead."
1,Are We There Yet?,"This book was much less funny than the Horrible Histories made by Terry Deary. It was not fun to read and I remember waiting and waiting for the end to come. I don't think many people would enjoy this book because it was no fun to read.Joe Waldman, age 11"
5,"Warm and Comfortable, but still stylish","I was looking for something warm and comfortable, but stylish and these fit the bill nicely. The waistband has no elastic - drawstring only. I was worried about the low waist being too low, but these fit nicely right at the hips. I bought three pair - white, grey and wine. The white and the grey are very fleecy inside, the wine isn't. They all look nice and are warm. I also have long legs, yet wear a small so was hoping they wouldn't bee too short. They were a perfect length - don't drag with tennis shoes, but cover ankle nicely. Sizing is correct - mine were true to a size small. Washed up nicely also - no shrinkage."
3,Fair to middling...,"I'm always on the lookout for comfortable, warm sweatpants to wear around the house. I had recently bought two different pairs by Russel Athletics (well-made) but found the mediums too large and the smalls too small (I'm 5' 7"", 117 lbs.) So, after searching some more, I bought these--despite the fact I knew the waist was on the low side. (I'm not young anymore, so I don't like having my midsection exposed.)I don't like baggy sweatpants, so I was pleased with the snug (not tight, however--for me, anyway) fit, though they were definitley lower than I like. However, after a few weeks of wearing them, they've completely lost their shape, even retaining the bend in the knees. I've had other sweatpants that held their shape longer, so I'm disappointed. In addition to the loss of shape, I'm constantly tugging at them to pull them up, despite the drawstring. If you only wear them once in a while, I suppose they'd hold their shape longer, but I won't be buying another pair."
2,Sweat pants!,"These are not yoga pants- they are sweat pants. I kept them to sleep in and lounge around the house, but they are NOT for exercising. Way too thick."
3,Sweats for lounging.,These are more like sweat pants. They run large which is not flattering but they are comfortable and great for hanging out at home.
4,Holiday Yoga Pants,These pants were purhased as a gift. Delivery was prompt and the pants are a nice quality. Hopefully the recipient is as happy with them as I am.
3,Women have absolutely no reason to fail,"Women have no reason not to succeed. from prek through high school, our educational system has been tailored to help girls succeed, while boys are ignored.More scholarships are given to women as more scholarships for men are eliminated leading to college campuses being 60% women to only 40% men.Just being a woman gains you advantages of federal and state funding denied to men. Sex-discrimination is acceptable if it's against boys and men, so women have absolutely no reason to fail, but when they do, hopefully they would learn from their mistake and avoid the feminist excuse of blaming everything on men."
3,"Good oatmeal, poor value","This oatmeal is great -- easy to cook, easy to store in the resealable bag, and tastes good too. It's also organic, which is important to more and more people nowadays. However, it's not a great value. I can buy organic rolled oats in the bulk foods section at the natural foods store for about $.80 a pound... and it's worth it to me to save the money in this area. If you want the convenience of having it delivered to your house (free Prime or ground shipping!), then go for it -- you won't be disappointed. But if you're already out and about running errands, swing by your natural foods store and pick some up there."
4,Great Production,This group would do great with some publicity. There is some amazing production happening on this album. I enjoyed their punk-rock-folk-funk-blues mix. Very well executed.
1,Do not buy!,"I ordered this from vision decor. The frame in the picture is not the one they currently sale! They said the manufacturer has changed it(of course they didnt tell me this until I received it!!). Instead of a bar that goes horizontal/across, the bar now goes vertical down the middle. When it arrived, it was missing the pins/bolts to assemble, and when I finally got the bolts to put it together, the holes were not lined up correctly, they were off by about 6 inches, so it couldnt even BE assembled! Be careful... I had to return it and get a refund."
3,not in perfect condition,"The frame arrived with two problems. 1. the middle bar has two holes on each end that are supposed to line up so i can stick a pin in them to secure it to the frame....well the holes did not line up so i was not able to secure the middle bar with the pins provided. 2. one of the feet was cracked.....it is still functional, but it was disappointing. other than that, it was fairly easy to put together and it holds my headboard and footboard well."
1,Bad Business,"I would never do business w/ Jerry's Furntire again. They had used Fedex for delivery and tells me that fedex made 3 attempts and left a postcard. Let me tell you I did not receive a postcard. And I am a working person you can't expect me to wait 2 weeks home for a package. I understand that it's not their fault, but fedex. But how is it that the company has no tracking information for their packages. I have received full refund which is the only good thing about all of this. But before they wanted to give me the full refund. They wanted to charge me $34.95 whether I wanted the package or not. SMH....Never again...."
3,Damaged paint,"Works overall, but most of the metal had been banged up and paint was scratched off in multiple areas. Still serves the purpose though."
2,Disappointed,"This IS THE CORRECT BED RAIL for the canopy bed frame. However, when I received the item, there were a lot of parts and hardware missing. Be prepared to go to your local hardware store. Also, you will need to rebuy the same washers, nuts and long bolts that come with the canopy bed frame in order to connect the headboard/footboard to the rails because the hardware they provide is only for assemblying the rail."
3,"Not as good as I expected, but OK","These were just OK. My son and I both expected them to work as good as on the TV but he found them hard to use, however the pages that come with the it to color in, have great patterns that appear as you color, so they look great regardless of if you got to blend colors or not. He enjoyed it very much anyway, and colored all the pages without getting bored. It arrived very quickly in the mail so that impressed me."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Bought a set for my kids. The colors don't blend and the marker isn't washable either. Ended up throwing them all in the trash. Don't waste your money!
5,better than tv,It was so easy to order this off of Amazon. Calling a 800 number off the TV can be very time consuming. Very happy with shipment it was timely. My daughter has begged me for months to order these for her. Now she and I are both happy. Very user friendly for kids and no mess!!!!
2,Where's the beef?,This entire book felt like the initial set up to an exciting story that never happened. The book read like a high level summary of what could have been a very interesting and exciting murder mystery. This is the first M. Truman book I've read so I'm hoping that given her success this just happens to be one of her weaker efforts.
2,What's the point?,"The mystery is obvious and while the characters are engaging, very little happens besides the crime that sets off the novel. There is plenty of wading through verbose descriptions and conversation however. This book might be welcome as distraction but it is not a rewarding, informative or particularly pleasant read because it is hollow and devoid of meaning or even a challenging plot."
2,MARGARET IS TOO POLITICAL,I have read many of Margaret Truman's books and enjoyed some of them. This one is ok for light reading.......but don't believe we need her editorial on all theRepublicans in Washington. Adds nothing to the story by taking nasty little digsat them. She would do well to stick to mystery in these books and if she has a'beef' with the Republicans.......write a book about that. The two don't mix
1,Broke after a week,"What else to say :-). I put in a pre-recorded tape, it made a clunk sort of noise and wouldn't play tapes after that. 2/3 of the screen was all snowy. I tried several different tapes before returning it to the store. Aside from that, I found it clunky to use. I should have come here for the reviews first."
1,I am on my third because they keep breaking,"I was expecting a quality Sony product when I bought this. I have another sony DVD player that I have been using for about 3 years without any problems. This unit is another story.After 4 months of use, the player stopped working with DVD/RW disks. A few days later, manufactured disks stopped working, now a few days later, no DVDs will play on the unit.I am so glad I got an extended warranty, because I am going to go and pick up my third new unit today for another 4 months of usage before the inevitable failure."
5,Great DVD/VCR Combo From Sony,"I bought this DVD/VCR two years ago, and I've had no problems. To keep this unit in good shape, you must use a good head cleaner. I'm upgrading to a digital unit, and will use this in my guest bedroom. My advice is to stick with a label/manufacturer that you're familiar with; a company that offers great products, excellent service, and reasonable prices. For me, I'll continue to buy Sony."
4,Great,I needed the book for class and ordered it close to the beginning of the semester. It was delivered at good time and also in described condition.
2,"Why ""the Flaw"" only gets 2 ** in rating system ...",It didn't have the story line of others of its ilk. I wanted to see more in depth of Greenspam. Wanted to see and hear a Why and How the Banks failed in a more coherent way ... only so-so ... mild and tepid ... I wanted HARD HITTIN' ...
1,wondering is occupy wall street made this,"We are so fortunate to have the 99 percent here to tell us how to feel. Phew, just in time. I was starting to think that government interference was the problem. Good thing this film set me straight!"
2,A Limited Story,"This is ""a love story"" written by a psychiatrist about the death of his wife from a cruel disease. It is well written and heart-felt but incomplete. The character of the wife, not as a patient or subject of illness, is left undeveloped. Instead, the story revolves around the husband/psychiatrist. He recounts his heated courtship with his wife; his dwindling love life by middle age; his attempts (constant and ill-fated) to escape his ""ethnic"" (Jewish) past; and the limits of science and medicine in the face of a relentless disease. There is something funny about the author's coping strategies that almost rescues the book. But the serious subject-matter called for more than a release of words. For in the end, one gets the sense, that through all the suffering the author has not really moved -- and has not found his true self (whatever that may be). That is sad."
1,a product from fwoods46,"when I received the curtis rt700 - 7"" LCD TV, it appeared in new-like condition and worked as expected. However, after using it for several hours (as a monitor overnight), it emitted a burning rubber-like odor. It stopped working. I had to dispose of it. I was disappointed with the purchase. It was a refurbished product to begin with."
1,"Junk, device terrible","I bought one online. First there's no SOUND. Duh. Now I decided to use it for something, so was using it on a video set to see footage from my camera. It worked for one (1) day now there's no VIDEO.The only thing that's working the one LED light that goes from red to green. TERRIBLE MACHINE. Waste of money. The manufacturer should be sued (class action). I read somewhere else that one almost caught on fire (didn't learn this till after I'd put down my money and bought this piece of trash. Rip off. UPDATE: The seller was nice enough to accept the machine but I can't find the entire (kids lost the remote, etc). So BAD machine but rather honest seller. I'll use the device as a door stop or home protection weapon. This month has been tough, I lost money on the software Harddrive Mechanic Gold, and now this Curtis LCD TV. I pray that some of you benefit from these reviews, and save your money. My heart will then feel better, until then, I'm disappointed."
2,Better than nothing!,"The tv's reception is ok, but the color from channel to channel is horrible. Some channels are so washed out that it is easier to lower the spectrum so it shows B&W than continue to play with the color controls. An auto feature would probably have helped. This tv is used for work & as such I found it to be a good deal for the price. The seller I purchased from was plain & truthful in describing the tv's failings so please understand the low rating is for the product itself not the seller. Thanks, T.J.L."
2,Sample vocalist - unwanted,"The musical arrangements are good, however the sample vocalist is recorded in the beginning of each track and on both L and R channels and you cannot mute it, therefore you cannot use this for performance. A terrible waste since the music is good quality."
5,Refreshing Illustrations for a Plastics Text,The illustrations in this book are clearly its greatest strength. The illustrator does a fabulous job of taking complex ideas and technical text and making them clear using enlightening 3D diagrams.
1,Horrible allergic reaction,"[...]This cream did nothing for me except for giving me a horrible rash on my face and neck. I am not an allergy prone person in general, but after spending over $[...] on this product and another $[...] on a dermatology visit and medicine, I was clearly very disappointed.By the way, I waited 3 months and tried the cream again and BANG within one day the rash came back."
1,Disappointing,I finished using this cream and it's disappointing - don't see anything happening to my skin. wonder why they call it X factor.
4,SIMILIAR TO RETIN A,"Been using this product several times a week for the last year and I think it is a pretty good face cream. I saw a dermatologist 15 years ago for acne and the doctor prescribed Retin A. This product is similiar in texture and smell to Retin A but without any nasty side effects. I'm close to 50 and get compliments on my skin once in awhile when out and about in public and at work. I also stay out of the sun, eat healthy and dont drink or smoke. Don't rate a product poorly just because you had an allergic reaction. Almost everyone I know has had a bad reaction to something during their life. I'm a tough grader so I didn't give it a five. There are very few things in life that I would give a 5 out of 5. I also use No 7 Protect and Perfect serum and that is also very good but at only half the cost. I have oily skin and thus large pores. No 7 noticeably reduces my large pores."
1,Wish I never set eyes on it,Bought the TRIAL OFFER for my wife as a little present to her. Did not know it was going to be that expensive. They took 94.99 out of my account within 2 weeks of her receiving it.There was nothing to say I had to send it back and it also did not state that IT WOULD BE A ROLLING CONTRACT.Have now managed to cancel this.BEWARE OF TRIAL OFFERS FROM THIS COMPANY.
1,Poor Bama Fans,This book serves no purpose. The book is written for Alabama fans and they are all illiterate.
1,Finebaum is an idiot,"Finebaum trashes every school, whether it's Auburn, Bama, or whoever else, all in the name of ratings. The state of Alabama would be better off if they boycotted everything Finebaum."
1,War Eagle,"Well reader from Tuscaloosa, AL, I can think of about 10 good reasons the 'sorry' Auburn team is better than the Bama team, but I dont want to reopen your sore wounds.This guy should write a book on Alabama starting with one thing even the Bama fans hate... Coach Fran.The fact of the matter is, this book is a cheap attempt at a few bucks, and Finebaum doesnt know his subject matter."
1,Paul Get A Life,The fact that this guy is able to maintain a sinecure as a sports talk show host making six figures per year proves that Alabama has serious education problems. The state would be better off if someone snuffed him out.
1,What A Sad Little Bald Man,"Hating everything and everyone will not grow even one follicle back on your smooth, shiny pate, Paul. And that hat doesn't make you look like Walter Winchell, either.Go Dawgs!"
1,grown up kids book being marketed as a juvenile book,"The pictures are top notch. The writing, give me a break. What elementary age child wants to decipher each sentence for the meaning. "" the sky blushed... the water is dapple in a confetti of pale light"" Parents read it yourself and just talk about what the pictures represent, you know what your child understands. It's a grown up kids book being marketed as a juvenile book."
1,Background vocals are hideous,"I am very dissapointed in the quality of the background vocals on Leader of the Band which I ordered as a single. They are quite hideous. And the problem is when you order the music, you can't always preview the parts that have them...so you don't know how good or bad till you order it and listen to the whole song. The instrumentals are fine, quite simple, they should be."
2,This book is not vintage Sara Hylton,"This book is not vintage Sara Hylton. I have read most of her books and have enjoyed each one more than the previous one. I saw this new book advertised before it was released and was hounding my local library to purchase it . I was so looking forward to reading it and was sorely disappointed. If I wanted to read a book of gossip I could have picked up my local newspaper and read the gossip column. The major characters were very well defined but the book was exceedingly slow and extremely boring. I kept waiting for Hylton's usual ""mystery"" theme and it never presented itself. The underlying theme of the best things happen to those who are patient and wait was very evident in Mary Styles, but it would seem to me Hylton could developed the love story in her usual style. All I could think of reading this book is ""I think I must be reading a Maeve Binchy novel"". Nonetheless, I will look forward to her next book and hope to find her usual style of writing."
3,Good enough story and writing to hold my interest.,"I enjoyed the characters, and wanted to see where the author was going to take them. Even given a few slower spots in the story, places where Hylton seemed to drag out things just a bit too long, I mostly felt that the story moved forward well. Not every character moved forward, and at least one or two actually seemed to move backward. But real life can be like that for people."
2,He has been much better...,"Not up to his great stuff, some good selections but still below expections. If you like Phil, you still may enjoy this one.I thought it was less than really good."
2,Not a fan,"Seriously - what is so special about this granola? I purchased it in the grocery store for $5, which is WAY too expensive for this tiny little package of NON-organic, bland granola. I suppose if you subscribed and saved (and bought in bulk) if might be worth it - if you even liked the taste and texture. Nature's Path organic granolas win the prize for best granolas in my book. This one is bland and unexciting..."
4,I eat it every morning.,"I love this stuff. I eat two servings almost every morning with a cup of skim milk. It's mildly sweet and berries taste great. The ingredient list is short and all the ingredients are easily recognizable(and natural!). When I'm in a bit more of a training mode, I mix in a scoop of unflavored whey protein isolate and it goes very well with this cereal and milk. I have Amazon shipping me 2 cases every other month and that seems to really cover me for this quick and tasty breakfast!"
5,Perfect,This product goes great with Greek Yogurt or alone. It's cheaper to buy here than in the grocery store. Thanks!
1,Horrible - wouldn't feed it to a horse,"This cereal is hard, tasteless, and very difficult to chew. Has a strange off-smell to it too. I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact I am going to write the company a letter since I am angry that I now have five and a half bags of crappy ""cereal"" lying around."
5,The Best Low Sugar Cereal,"This is great mixed with plain yogurt, Fat-Free ricotta (use Calabro brand only, the rest are terrible!), or just plain out of the bag for a snack. Bear Naked really delivers on taste and quality. Plenty of almonds inside too, a wonderful product!"
3,Bear Naked Vanilla Almond Crunch Fit,"This product adds a nice crunch to my frozen yogurt that I eat and it tastes very good. The only downside to me is that there are not many almonds in it for the price. I was getting it on subscribe and save because I loved it so much, but it seems as if the company started to add less almonds so I no longer get it."
3,A little bland,"The crunchy product has a subtle vanilla flavor. The oats are rather bland and pasty. Almonds are sparse. Low in sugar and salt, but fairly high in calories. Good snack for someone looking to limit sugar and salt."
2,Too sweet and costly,"If there's a Whole Foods store near your home or work, they sell this product for 30-50 cents less, per package and you won't have to wait for delivery. And, if you are sugar-sensitive, don't buy this flavor...it's a little too sweet."
3,NOT SAME AS ORIGINAL PRODUCT,"The original product, which I bought a few years back, were very tasty and full of flavor. Now the product is lacking in flavor and lacking in some ingredients, but still nice aromatic bouquet. It's NOT the same excitement my taste buds got orginally from the product. I DON'T think it's a fluk and every bag is the same. I've tried at least two bags of the new shipment already and every bit taste the same. Portions ""appear"" to be slightly down too. I still have (4) bags from the (6) bag order. This shipment, I bought both Very Berry and Vanilla Almond Crunch (12 bags total). What a disappointment ! ! Too bad, I won't buy this product again."
2,No go.,"This tastes like someone left the cereal box open...for tooo long. It's on the stale side, though it smells great.Too bad I purchased 6 bags. I DO enjoy the Banana Granola though, its excellent."
1,I dunno: Barley Malt!,"Barley malt? These guys are friends from grade school when they were spitballing each other, not reading ingredients lists, of gluten-free products because they've added barley malt...the reason you can't buy off the shelf of a regular grocery store...just about every cereal it seems has barley malt.I don't get it...can we google on this and see if it's gluten-free? I did and the answer was NO!pick the spitballs outten your ears and try again fellers..."
2,Granola I Would NOT Buy Again,"Since this was the only Bear Naked Granola on the store shelf that did NOT contain Canola Oil, which I'm very allergic to, it was the only one I could use my coupon on. Maybe the other Bear Naked varieties:Bear Naked All Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6),Bear Naked All Natural Granola, Peak Protein, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6),Bear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch Granola, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6),Bear Naked All Natural Granola, Banana Nut, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6),Bear Naked 100% Pure & Natural Granola, Maple Pecan, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6),Bear Naked 100% Pure & Natural Granola, Peak Flax, Oats & Honey with Blueberries, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6), andBear Naked Granola Heavenly Chocolate, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6), taste better, but I found this product unpleasant, with a foul aftertaste coming from the freeze dried berries.I recommend theBack To Nature Oat Vanilla Almond Agave Granola, 12-Ounce (Pack of 3)instead."
2,Yuk - gag - choke,"This looked like a great low-sugar cereal and had all of the elements I like in a cereal - berries, flax, no weird ingredients...so I gave it a try. I poured myself a bowl of cereal the day I got it in the mail and couldn't finish the bowl. It's like eating raw oats - which is not a pleasant experience, and it has a weird artificial aftertaste - even though it doesn't have artificial ingredients in it. I couldn't figure out why it tasted so strange. Sorry guys, but I may have to feed the remaining 5 and 4/5 bags of cereal to the local horses. I couldn't even choke it down."
4,Of moderate use,"This is a travelogue. I didn't expect an expose or a documentary, but I was somehow expecting more than I got.I think it was only about 9 minutes long. After watching what can best be described as a mini-letter box format, I was glad it wasn't longer. I will watch it next time on my laptop.I needed this to see what Haiti looked like in the WWII era. So I got what I needed."
5,bionic breaks,I recently purchased the vinyl release of boris dlugoschs'bionic breaks'. As usual vinyl releases only have a few of the tracks on offer. The twin vinyl has 9 tracks - hip hop be bop-al naafiysh-the party scene-one for the treble-ray gunomics-jam on it-in the bottle-play that beat mr.dj-and-makin music. All a great cross-section of early eighties electro-we need more of these to spread da word of the good stuff. Funk on!
2,Kagome voice stinks!!!,Its just not the same with out Kagome's voice!!! they could of tried a little harder to find someone in her voice!
5,Inuyasha!!!!,"if you love Inuyasha as much as I do than you must definitely purchase this!!!!!!!! it was fantastic! only downside was that Inuyasha, seshomaru, and kagomes voices have changed..."
4,Dub finally!!!,"The voice may sound different, but it does n't take away from this anime. If your a fan, see this and if your a anime fan that never saw inuyasha, what wring with you. See it, but there are better anime like fairy tail, naruto shippuden, and many more, but hey if you have money burning, this maybe a worth while run for your money"
5,THE BEST OF ANIME,This is my favorite Anime series. I love inuyasha and Sesshomoru and wished the series would still go on. Just shows that you do not have to be a kid to enjoy Anime for I am well seasoned!
4,Almost 5 stars,"Finally the ending to a great series. However, These final episodes are very rushed. A lot going on in one episode. So much in fact it's like they just wanted to hurry up and get it done. Some of the voices are different too. But at least there is a conclusion."
5,Fantastic series,"Only complaint is splitting the last season into two DVD sets. Money grab, but I'll pay it to see how the series ends."
4,Final Act: part 1?,I waited so long to finally own the remaining episodes of this great anime classic but was sad to here that they didn't just make a complete series instead they divided it up into two parts and something tells me that later on they might just make a complete series set. I hope they aren't double dipping.
3,shipping was fast,Didn't see that it was 2 dvds its ok im stuck with it I thought i was buying the whole series.
4,Finally an End!,"I've been watching this on and off on HuluPlus. So I'll wait till it comes out as a completed box set. Feels like I've been waiting too long for this. There is definitely a disconnect somewhere.Anyway, I purchased from Ebay, the complete 7 seasons set not knowing I could have paid $9 less through Amazon. I think the one I bought is from a prior production run. The one here looks like a new production run. I used to see the individual seasons go for $120 each 5 yr.'s ago with or without trinket. Who know's, maybe 30 yr.'s from now, one of those unopened trinket season box's could go for $100k like the unboxed bobbafett from 1976? that sold for $19k.I think the music from the Inuyasha series is the best I have listened to even if my copy was a knock-off. An absolute top-notch production as well the anime. The licensed copies from other countries go for alot less on Ebay apparently. Knock-offs have about 97% of the fidelity clarity of the licensed DRM copies I think but play anywhere."
2,my least favorite,This is easily my least favorite SILVER MT. ZION release. The music has come down in scale... it's not nearly as epic as I had hoped. And the vocals are solidly on the whining side. I've quickly grown weary of them.I would've done myself a favor by passing on this release. It adds nothing to their oeuvre.
1,He should consider voice lessons,"I've followed the progression from GYBE! and i like the instrumentals because they have a beautiful cryptic flow. His voice, which is really added to this album more than any other I have run into, is not. He sings off key and whines and complains and throws away anything entrancing or entrenching about the music. I find myself skipping through entire tracks trying to find tracks where he's not singing so I can feel I haven't wasted my money, but to no avail.And as for the lyrics, I'm sorry, sir but Canada is not an oppressive country. Stop fooling yourself and get some voice lessons."
1,terrible echo,I tried this headset with 2 different phones (AT&T 955 and a Polycom) and both had terrible echo when the user spoke. I heard my voice louder in the echo than the other parties voice. I called GN Netcom customer service (they were very nice and answered quickly) and they tried trouble shooting but to remove the echo meant reducing the speaking volume and the listening volume so low I had to yell so my party could hear and strain so I could hear. Maybe it would work better with different make phones.
2,Magnetic Horses,Was not impressed with them. I found that they were hard to balance and had bought them for an 8 yr old who lost interest in them quickley
3,Bald & Julian Lennon,"Bald - aka Frenchman Daniel Adjadj - sings a duet with Julian Lennon on the track ""All Alone."" Stevie Wonder plays harmonica on ""Annie Stays."" 1996 Japanese release on Quattro with one bonus track - ""Message Of Love."""
2,Not so good...,"I've been using this for some time, and sadly it has had no affect at all. I know it's a hard area get results from but it was still diappointing."
4,"Mistress Of The Dark - very dark, indeed","MISTRESS OF THE DARK, by Sephera Giron, is a whole different barrel of weasels. Giron keeps us squarely behind the protagonist's point of view. The entire novel is written in diary form, with a narrator that's about as unreliable as a used Lada. This is a long walk through a dark country - ""We be in deep psychosis now, bwana!"" It feels a little like a testimony, and it's up to the reader to weigh and measure the validity and reality of the narrative. It's a study in character that's about as fun to read as recieving a razor wire enema. Norman Bates has got nothing on Abigail Barnum.Thoughtful, dark and insightful. Not necessarily a fun read, but an intriguing one. Definitely worth checking out.Yours in horror,Steve Vernon"
1,A Flop,"This book started out well, but quickly turned out to be a book full of filler. Every time the author should've used 'than', she used 'then'. There were so many grammatical errors. The books is filled with the main character's odd dreams that are boring and don't go with the story. They take up PAGES and PAGES of the book. The only good thing I can say about the book is that the author wasn't afraid to be explicit."
4,2nd Time,"These work fine, the 2nd time. Ordered Black and Color. Color worked out of the box. Black did not. Printer didn't recognize it. Cleaned it to no avail. Supplier quickly sent me a new one from different manufacturer that worked correctly. Saved a ton!"
5,"Very Cheap, fast shipping.",It is cheap so far so good I just hope it allows me to print the amount of pages it promises too.
2,Not a good idea,"I read reviews before purchasing this remanufactured ink cartridge. Sounded okay, so I ordered. Wasn't a great idea. The ink didn't last long at all. The quality was okay at first."
1,HP remanufactured ink cartridges,"SORRY, BUT YOUR REMANUFACTURED HP INK CARTRIDGES ARE THE WORST!I TOOK A CHANCE AND ORDERED THREE (56,57 AND 58) AND ALL WOULDNOT EJECT INK; IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE ALL EMPTY!QUALITY CONTROL?AMAZON OWES ME 3 NEW CARTRIDGES THAT WORK!"
4,Worth the price,"These do not last as long as OEM (original equipment manufacturer) cartridges, but the print quality is good and for the price is a great value"
4,Good customer service on cartridge error,"I purchased two color and two black cartridges. I've only used two of the cartridges so far (one black and one color). Unfortunately, the black cartridge kept giving me a ""remove and check the cartridge"" error message. (This could be due to the cartridge's past expiration date.) After following their troubleshooting steps, the printer just simply refused to accept the cartridge. Fortunately, the company was nice enough to send over a replacement.So far, the ink quality has been consistent. We usually use it for normal or fast draft printing for school work. I've not had the chance to use it for high-quality printing yet, but may edit this review when I have."
1,Did not work at all,"Imagine, you are sitting at your computer putting the finishing touches on your resume to take with you to a job interview. You lean back in your chair to admire the incredible professionalism that IS the look of your resume. You click print. What comes out of your printer, however; looks garbled and completely unusable.Don't want this story line to be YOUR story line? There is one very simply way to avoid the issue: DO NOT buy these. They are a complete wate of 15 dollars. Dried up. Then didn't work. I don't know about anyone else but the ONLY time I print thing is when its important. I have learned my lesson. I will go ahead and spring for the real ink.I bought these and then got busy and wasn't able to install them quick enough to legitimately complain and get a refund. 15 dollars is only a better deal if they print but seeing as how they did not, it was simply a waste of 15 dollars.Learn from my mistake. Do. Not. Buy. These."
1,False Advertising!,I specifically searched for FOCUS brand cartridges when I was directed to this seller. I always use FOCUS brand and have not had many problems. I received my order today and was extremely disappointed that the cartridges I ordered were in fact not FOCUS brand. I have had bad luck with other re-manufactured cartridges and feel that advertising the FOCUS brand logo provides the customer with a false sense of the product. I will make sure not to order from this seller again in the future!
2,You get what you pay for,"I'm printing a picture directory for Church.These refilled cartridges do not have the quality of HP cartridges.Side by side you can easily see the difference in quality. Got about 250 pages out of the 57 knock-off cartridge...that's probably reasonable, but again quality stinks."
1,Not a good replacement ink,I bought this ink 2 months ago and used it for a week. After 1 week the black ink dried out although there is 90 percent ink left on the tank while the color ink fade so fast you can hardly see the different colors.I use to bring the original cartridge at office depot and have them refill them at their machine. That work well although the ink will only last for 6 months but at least much better than this replacement ink from this vendor that last only for a week. A friend of mine that brought the same ink hp 56 and hp 57 has similar experienced.
1,Did'nt work,I was excited to be able to buy discounted recyled ink. I got it in my printer and aligned he cartridges. Print check went good and ink seemed to be working. About a week later the black ink wouldent print anything. Completly out. Only thing it printed was the test sheet. Very disapointed. Waisted money.
1,Don't waste your money,"We thought we'd try these remanufactured cartridges because they cost so much less than the originals. We found out why they were so cheap. They lasted for about 20 pages and then the printer quick working because of a ""cartridge error."" We had to go to Office Depot and get new ones."
1,Poor quality refilled ink cartridge,Cartridge produced very poor quality print leaving streaks throughout the page. Purchased through Amazon and will not buy again. I tried cleaning the contacts but it was the remanufactured cartridge that failed to produce a good clean print.
1,Defective product.,"I purchased this product despite several reviews warning against doing so. Reviews said things like, ""cartridges print fine for 3-4 sheets, and then the printer no longer recognizes it and fails to print"" or, ""print quality is OK, but is unacceptable if you're printing a resume or other important document."" Unfortunately, I also encountered both of these scenarios, and now the print cartridges are boxed up and ready to get sent back to wherever they came. I'll be spending a little more money and purchasing a better product next time. Don't waste your money on these cartridges, and don't support a business who delivers such a sub-standard product."
2,Ink,"I can't in all fairness give this product a good review the price was right but the black ink cartridge would not work nat even when I tried all there suggestions I guess you get what you pay for I ended up going to the super store for a replacment, I will not use them again."
1,cartridges,"bad service, made an error on the order, also very bad and poor quality, called and emailed several time expecting customer service, i guess they don't care, about anything."
5,BUY THIS ONE!!!,Bought these for our printer to save a buck and damn glad we did! Very affordable and works just like OEM. No printer errors or blotchy printings. Excellent product!!! highly recommend
1,Just say no!,I installed the cartridges March 8. On May 5 the color cartridge caused an error message on my printer. The return window closed in April. That's all you need to know.
2,Smudgy,"First the black cartridge was the wrong one but company promptly sent the correct one. I got one good page after test page printed, now the black smudges or barely works at all. Disappointed."
5,As good as new,"These things were packaged very well; I was impressed by their cleanliness. I have only bought one pair, so I can't speak for the quality over time, but the set I received were as good as new cartridges. Couldn't ask for more on these. Great products, really saves a ton of money."
2,Didn't work,"Item didn't work for me, but I knew that might happen. I still gave it 2 stars because I'm sure it worked for plenty of others and I just got a bad one. Oh well."
3,"Worked for a while, then stopped","After a few months of intermittant use, both cartidges were suddenly rejected by my HP PSC 2200 all-in-one. Tried all of the troubleshooting the internet had to offer to no avail. Had to make an emergency run to Target to cough up $75 for HP cartridges when the printer stopped mid-day and refused to use these cartridges (they had ink, the device just wouldn't recognize them). Would not buy again."
3,HP Ink,Color cartridge worked well but the Black one ran out after 3 uses of light printing xxx xxx xxx xx
1,3 words: Does NOT work,"I'm very disappointed that these ink cartridges don't work for my printer. Before purchasing, I double checked that HP 56 & 57 ink cartridges are compatible with my HP PSC 1315xi, and they are. My very first and subsequent prints look like they're from an ink cartridge that is out of ink. Can barely see the prints. :( I'm returning it."
1,Worked for about 12 pages,"It worked for a few pages until it started skipping portions of the page. It is impossible to print more than one picture without having problems with printing quality. I was warned that remanufactured cartridges didn't work, now I wish I had listened. May work for some, but the ones we recieved caused nothing but problems with printing quality."
1,Junk,Junk. Doesn't work. Get what you pay for and we got nothing for this. Please send us our money back!
5,Ink cartridges,"I wasn't sure about ordering re manufactured ink cartridges, but after putting them in the printer & using them for a week or so, I'm sold.....I'll never order anything but these in the future! I saved a bunch of money & they work just like the ones that cost three times as much. Thanks for the speedy sale too, I didn't wait very long to receive these!!"
1,Do not buy,"I ordered two of these inkjet, now the printer will not print and does not rececognise the cartridges. A waste of money"
3,Bad printer or bad ink? I dunno.,"Yes, it's cheaper, yes it worked for a little while, but later the printer just wouldn't recognize the cartridge at all. But maybe my printer sucks. I'ma go office space on it."
5,Great Product,"The ink cartridge products worked great. They were just what I ordered, fit just as they should have and have worked great so far. They have now been installed in my printer for about 2 weeks, no issues whatever. I have used these cartridges before and they have always been reliable and last as long or longer than the original supplier carts that I used before."
2,I liked the idea - worked for a bit: 30 color copies later... kaput!,"I was suspicious when reading the previous reviews about these re-manufactured printer cartridges, but thought to my self, ""what can i loose?"" I found that the cartridge emptied just when I needed to print something in color for my kid to go to school the next day. The two lessons to be learned here, if you leave your homework assignment till Sunday night, a small hiccup can be a big problem. The second is, you get what you pay for; and these cheapies will not be in my shopping cart ever again."
1,Printer doesn't work,"After I replaced my name brand HP cartridges with these non-HP refilled ones, my printer worked for about 2 print jobs then just stopped working. If I place my old cartridges in the printer works fine (except for the fact that I am low on ink). Would not recommend, not compatible!"
2,"Misleading & False advertising by seller ""OCProducts""","I ordered these inks by Focus ink as per the advertisement from the seller ""OCProducts"" but they sent me some other generic ink. When I emailed them, they wrote me back saying even focus is a generic ink and that their inks are covered for year etc etc blah blah.....I didn't return the ink because I had an immediate need and could not wait for another couple weeks to get replacement from them...i am sure they didn't have Focus ink otherwise they would have sent it to me at first itself...If I had gone into a refund mess and other back & forth with the seller, it would just have taken couple more weeks.but the first question is, why do they advertise as Focus ink and send you their own inks...this is clearly cheating the customers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller....BUYERS BEWARE if you are specific about FOCUS ink DO NOT BUY products from this seller even if it the adv shows as such. They will not send you Focus ink."
5,Excellent purchase,"I purchased ink cartridges and received them super fast. Plugged them in when I received them, and the ink cartridges work perfectly. Highly recommended."
5,HP 56 Black & HP 57 Tri-Color Remanufactured Ink Cartridges,I have had great luck with these re-manufactured cartridges. I used to be afraid to try cartridges that weren't new for fear they wouldn't work but they are no different and a lot cheaper. I'm on a fixed income and cannot afford to be purchasing new ink cartridges as much as I go through them copying family photos and information for my genealogy. These cartridges make it possible for me to continue printing.
1,Doesn't work.,"Just doesn't work with my printer. Have hp 6110 all in one. Have purchased recycled cartridges, but these have serious issues with them. RECOMMENDED NOT TO PURCHASE."
3,"Grand Title, Narrow topic","Readers looking for a general history of the early years of Apartheid should take a pass on ""The Making of Apartheid."" The title is incredibly misleading: far from telling the story of South African society and politics in the 1950s, the book is a monograph on the design and implementation of ""influx control,"" the government's system for regulating the growth of urban African populations. Apartheid was a LOT more than that! As micro-history, the book is well-written and alive to the vagaries (and contradictions) of bureaucratic and business reality; it is much better than the average recycled PhD dissertation. But readers unfamiliar with South African history will be lost.PS: Prof. Posel, ""prevaricate"" does not mean ""equivocate."" You repeatedly use the former term when you mean the latter. You should ask Oxford University Press to fix the mistake in future editions."
4,Excellent 'Care' Cards,"I gave out these cards in my undergraduate class on self care. I was concerned about the femininity of the cards. However, my male students came to choose a card as well as my female students. I liked the size. Great way to end the quarter/semester."
4,"Good for reflection, meditation, and self-exploration","This deck of cards provides a good jumping-off point for reflection. Choose one, and focus on the ""new-age"" images, most of which are highly detailed and somewhat resemble dream images. Inspirational/guiding quotes are on the back. Be aware that there is some frontal female nudity on a small number of the cards - not pornographic, but rather artistic in nature; this may be ""jolting"" to some viewers. Both African-American and Caucasian women are portrayed; there is only one image that uses a male figure as the main feature. If you're having trouble focusing on a bothersome issue, or slowing down in your life, this deck is quite helpful as a tool of self-exploration. Images are by three different artists. You can preview some at the author's own website."
5,Soulfully Spectacular,"These cards are simply beautiful and therapeutic both to look at and to read. The art tends toward a Romantic style and features women of many cultures. Some cards do feature nudity and while it is artistic, rather than pornographic, this is something to consider before buying this deck."
3,Quick response,I actually cancelled by order for this product because I had changed my mind. The company responded quickly to me and were very helpful cancelling the order and refunding my money. They are very easy to deal with. I would order from them again.
5,Great Information for 4x4 owners of all experience levels,"Some of us think we know it all, then we see an instructional DVD like this! This DVD gives you the basic know how to perform safe recovery of your stuck rig.My favorite section has to be on recovery with the Hi Lift Jack. Bill shows how to use this tool as a hand winch, which could save your butt, and save you from buying a winch!"
1,Not proffessional,"Was not complete, two were duplicate and one was missing.. Not able to identify levels because swatches were not numbered. If I could identify levels by eye I would not need the swatches, so without the numbers they are useless. Does not look like the picture. Looked like someone just threww a bunch of swatches in a bag."
3,So-So,"I bought this book after reading all of the five-star hoopla that was already posted on it. Granted, considering that the authors are using only the sun and the moon, the descriptions are pretty good. But, with only the sun and the moon, the accuracy is going to be limited. This book is a good ""party"" book and has the potential to get others interested in learning about astrology utilizing a superficial approach. However, if one is truly interested in learning more about astrology, this is not the book to buy. These authors are obviously gifted astrologers--as well as writers. I see they recently put out a short ""beginners"" book (click on authors' names on the left side of the screen). I hope they are planning to write beyond that. They've got great potential."
1,"Zombies, vampires, vikings, Western ? Huh?","Yep, they tried to throw everything and everyone in here, but the mix just does not work on any level. There are too many killing scenes while there is very little story to balance it."
3,Overview of war but dated at this point in time,"This book gives an overview of the war. Unfortunately it is the one of the few that does. The major problem is that, at least today, the book is dated and presents nothing new. This was not the case when it was first printed however. Nevertheless it makes for a good introduction into the war."
5,Amazing!,I used this to clean a pair of sterling silver earrings and necklace from Tiffany & Co. It works really well and its so quick and easy to use! Would definitely recommend it.
2,Not for Tiffany jewelry,"Saw decent reviews so I thought I'd try it on my Tiffany jewelry. Bad idea. Girls, don't bother buying this."
1,Worst Product,This is worst brand cleaner! It turn my sterling silver chain BLACK!!!! I completely lost my silver chain shining.. I would never recommend this product to anyone else.I am very disappointed..
1,Contains Carcinogens!!,"This product contains a carcinogenic substance - thiourea, which causes cancer on the thyriod gland and can cause cancer through inhalation or even just skin contact! I can't believe this is not mentioned anywhere on the product website! I regret not reading the label more carefully before I opened the jar and stuck my nose in it. I am disposing of it right away."
1,Old? Simply didn't work!,"I have used Hagerty's silver polish and jewelry cleaner in the past with great results. I ordered this jewelry cleaner and cleaned several pieces -- I could immediately tell that the product was not working. In fact, after everything dried, it appeared to be even MORE tarnished than before I put it in the cleaner. Not sure what is going on here, but I'm glad I didn't pay a lot and I hope that a second cleaning in something else will reverse the staining that got worse when I used this stuff. I guess this is a product that one should buy locally from a trusted source -- not online."
5,Cleans super fast,Was so happy with how fast this cleans my silver! Almost instantaneous! No scrubbing or polishing needed. I dared to clean a few of my favorite necklaces from Tiffany's and it worked beautifully.
5,The best,Easy and quick to use u with amazing results. I bought it based on reviews and wasn't dissatisfied all of my jewlery looks great
5,Does the job,I bought this based on all the great reviews. Most of the jewlery I owe is silver so I really needed a fast and easy fix for the dullness and the darkening that comes with time. This works almost instantly so take case not to go overboard with this. I'm very satisfied with this product.
3,STINKS SO BAD!!!!,"This has got to be the WORST smelling ""anything"" I've EVER smelled. Has the strongest rotten egg smell you could possibly imagine. It does work though....but only if you can through the smell to actually USE it.Bought mine at Linens-n-Things for $3.99."
1,Poor quality of the CD ruins the masterpieces,"I agree with H.C. Morgan.The bigger your love is to the works (or masterpieces) introduced, the more disappointed and unpleasant feeling you would have when listening to the CD.Just alright to play the disk with a PC, not hifi or home theater system.No matter how cheap the price is, it'll be a bad choice. Why has EMI had such a poor production?"
4,Easy India Culture Reading,"This is a nice airport book, particularly when you're on your way to India. I found most of the reading particularly simple and much of it common knowledge for someone who travels once in awhile."
4,great product V E R Y SLOW service,the book is great but the service from this source was extremely slow almost two weeks to get a book.
3,Haven't gone to India yet But.....,I bought this book with the anticipation of eventually going to India but more so to better understand my Indian in laws. I always felt like there was something I was missing when my husband and I would visit his family. This book explained a few etiquette questions that I had. It's a good starter book but there is always room for improvement.
5,Required Reading for ANYONE traveling to India,"India is a culture that is far outside the understanding of most westerners. This book was easy to read and understand and DEFINITELY helped us to respond, behave and act properly in a very foreign land.The book is direct, concise and well written. We would recommend this to anyone visiting a culture that will appreciate the effort not to offend.This book was really A+_."
3,An Inquiry into the Banal...,"I am preparing for my first trip to India. I purchased this book along with the Lonely Planet guides to India and Rajasthan. I must say that this book doesn't really give that much more by way of guidance than your basic wikipedia article or the section on etiquette in the LP guide. Most of the book consists in glosses on Indian religion, politics, and culture. While there is worthwhile advice to be found in this book, I do not recommend it as a way to understand Indian culture or to follow Indian norms. In both this book falls short. Instead, this is ""India for Idiots"", a banal and trifling discussion of the most basic Indian practices ('don't shake with your left hand, bring toilet paper and other boring suggestions are everywhere in this book).If you want a rough guide, use the web. Forums like IndiaMike provide more in-depth advice about Indian customs than books like this."
4,The Best of Phil Driscoll,"This work is a compilation of some of Phil`s best work from earlier albums. They are all well done in Phil`s usual unique and very anointed style. However if you are a big Driscoll fan you probably have many of the same songs on different albums. This is the only reason I gave it just 4 stars. It is still excellent music which glorifies the Lord and if you don`t mind listening to Phil repeat some songs, which I can`t imagine any Driscoll fan doing, then definitely BUY THIS ONE!"
4,The Book That Resurrected a Reality,"This book, by Mitroff and Denton (two widely respected scholars) many consider to be the christening bell and watershed moment for the Academy of Management (largest and most recognized management guild for managementscholars) to accept the reality of faith's significance within the workplace context. In many ways this book sets the agenda and provides the starting point for researchers within this field. Although, many feel it is not providing a starting line, in as much as it acts as a reminder of many in generations past who understand that religion, spirituality and faith have always acted as a motivator (94% of Americans believe in God) for people within the workplace.Ewest, TimVisiting Research Collaborator,Princeton University Faith and Work Initiative"
2,juvenile; author capable of better i think,"Although I liked the beginning of the first chapter, and found some lines very clever (and antipated more of the same), I lost interest quickly. The characters, jobs and dialogue felt so artificial that I couldn't relate. I lived in NYC and they just didn't feel real, and the protagonist's job seemed childish. Perhaps I simply prefer more sophistication from a 30 year old character...."
3,Typical chick lit - funny and easy read,"This was a decent read - I gave it three stars only because it took such a long time for me to get into the actual story. I found it a little annoying that the book it titled 'Up and Out' and it clearly says in the description that the main character deals with being laid off, but she doesn't actually get laid off until about halfway through. It's as if you are waiting for this to happen but the author keeps putting it off.After she was laid off I found the book more enjoyable - it was funny at times and I think most women would be able to relate at something going on with the main character. The ending was a little too perfect for me, but overall cute story.It was a nice read while I was on vacation and then before heading to bed."
3,Once you get past Burton's racism and intolerance......,"Richard Burton gave me a rare insight into the attitude of the British in India almost exactly 100 years before I was born in a small town about 10 miles from Ootacamund. It was very interesting to me to read a description of Burton's passage up to Ooty on horseback. The railroad and roads (with their 13 ""hairpin bends"") came later I suppose. That region of India is very dear to my heart and I carry many pleasant memories of my life in the Nilgiris."
5,Excellent performances and unique music,"This is my favorite Christmas CD, and it is very different from everything else we hear this time of year."
3,A strong start,"This is an enjoyable book that is easily read. You do not have to be Indian to get the symbolism or the culturalisms in this collection of stories. The second half of the book was a true let down. It centers around the lives of New Yorkers who are all seeking something and inevitably dissappointed. For some reason most of the characters in the second half were gay which had nothing to do with India or any discernible association with Indian culture. It's not a bad book its just not very good. If your looking for something to read on the way to work, or something that you will be able to walk away from for a few days without feeling like you've got to find out what happened- this is the book your looking for."
1,Letdown,"I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about this book. I was bored from the moment I opened it, but of course, I had to finish what I started. The characters had no depth and the storylines went nowhere. It was just like walking in on someone's life for a day or two and realizing that there was nothing special about it. Maybe that was the point, but I was pretty disappointed with the stories."
5,hitman 2,this game total overdose is one of the coolest games that ever came out the graphic are cool and brillant colors but wouldnt recommend it to young one to many bad words in spanish but other then that i rated a 10.
2,dont wast your money,not much of a game has nothing to do with drug dealing and the game just goes in circles
4,A complete guide,This book covers many essential properties of x-rays and crystals. This makes it a little easier for a beginner to read. The book has detailed experimental and analytical methods for analysis of polymers.
4,Very cute,This cartoon is very entertaining for a younger crowd. I'd say 2-7 year olds. My 2 and 5 year old love it. It is not fast paced and absolutely no violence.
5,a really cute DV D,my great-granddaughter loves Kipper -they are so cute -lots of lessons and lots of love in these DVD's
4,Best female voice!,She has a fantastic voice. I always kepp an eye on her new stuff. My mom refers to her as the knew Patsy.
4,Excellent collection!,"Leann Rimes has had a very successful music career so far. This greatest hits album shows her growth. Somehow the songs produced by her dad Wilbur Rimes are conservative by country's standards, such as Blue, One Way Ticket and How Do I Live. But Leann branches out from that mode with later songs produced by Trevor Horn (I went the same guy that did Seal, Tina Turner and Cher's albums did Leann's songs), and even Desmond Child (known for Bon Jovi's hits). And her going to Graham Stack to remix Can't Fight the Moonlight just steps the momentum a bit. They allowed her to experiment more. Love the Written In the Stars duet with Elton John. I liked the very funky Life Goes On. Would have wanted Review My Kisses from Twisted Angel on here. But her country numbers are still her strongest suit. Leann sounds so irresistable vocally on all the songs and I hope that she continues to make more exciting music in the future."
2,"Her voice was something else early on,but things fell","at first Leann Rimes seemed destined for a great career&""Blue"" sounded so Good coming from her.She was early on in Her Career channeling Patsy Cline but nowdays She is headed toward Britney Spears ville&lets say expectations have fallen,fallen.the highlights here are the early stuff for me.Her material went down hill over time&vocally She still is decent but that brief feeling of Magic went out the window."
3,why is this in Bluegrass?,"LeAnn Rimes is about as bluegrass as Frank Zappa. C'mon amazon....get it right, or don't do it at all! I like LeAnn, but she is NOT a Bluegrass performer! PERIOD!"
2,Not Bad,"This is a collection of Leann's most popular songs, and it definitely shows her diverse style. I like most of the songs on this album, but I have one complaint - the album cover!! The album cover is so fake looking, that it almost looks computer generated. It is so unnatural looking. I would have preferred to see a photo that was not so airbrushed and redone. This album is not bad, if you are a huge Leann fan, otherwise it is rather boring and mundane."
5,THE BEST IS YET TO COME!,"This is an awesome collection of songs! Spanning LeAnn Rimes seven-year career, fifteen of her greatest hits have been assembled on this CD! The hits are awesome, ranging from country (""Blue""), to dance (""Can't Fight the Moonlight""), to pop (""Life Goes On""). Three new tracks are highlighted as well! The best of the new tracks is the song ""This Love,"" a moving ballad signaling that the best is yet in come from this beautiful and talented singer! Grade: A+"
4,LeAnn fever,"At fifteen LeAnn Rimes was a successful country starlet with a voice that can shut up many competitors. Her rendition of `Blue' showcased her a vocal powerhouse. But, other than the odd country ballad and a few wishy-washy hits, LeAnn doesn't have a lot to fill this collection. `How Do I Live' is, of course, on the release and her other smash `Can't Fight The Moonlight,' from the Coyote Ugly soundtrack is also present. Rimes visits classic balladry on `You Light up My Life.'`I Need You' and `Life Goes On' are booth pop endeavors that show the direction Rimes is really aiming at after her feud with her record company and her own dad."
5,Lovely!,"If you are looking for sampling a variety of music, this is for you. I gave it to all of my piano students for them to be able to listen to some good piano music. We don't do enough listening in my opinion and this recording is not only good, it is VERY affordable."
5,Well programmed and selected set,"These days many music fans with grounding in good ol' rock and roll have bent their ears to light, melodic jazz standards. Here's a challenge: pick up this low-priced CD, take note of the famous names and that each track averages about 3 minutes in length - that's what us rockers have been raised on.A little crass, but....check this one out. I can't imagine any heavy metal fan turning away from the exquisite, haunting ""Waltz No. 15 in A-flat, Op.39"" by Brahms, or ""La fille aux cheveux de lin..."" by DeBussy; factor in *5* compositions by Chopin, and you've got a keeper. Maybe just beneath Zep on the carousel (but it's all in the proverbial family).Note that Chopin is next sectioned off, as one might expect in a Classical compilation. So the flow of the music is regenerative to the senses, as well.Dame Moura Lympany plays with breathtaking sensitivity and delivers one for the ages."
4,VALUE FOR MONEY,Dame Moura is my favourite pianist. Her great style and sublety of expression comes out in all her recordings. this CD is the best value for money ever!!
1,So cold and emotionless,"I just popped this cd into the school library cd player and from just two tracks and skipping through others I could tell that this was recorded with no artistic temperament or emotion. Her ""Rondo all turca"" is boring and her ""Un Sospiro"" lacks the passion and fervor of the Marc-Andre Hamelin recording. This is clearly just a marketing slap job. I am no purist, I find nothing wrong with making greatest hits cds, but they need to be high quality, not just some run-of-the mill, uninspired, going-through-the-motions junk."
5,Regarding Mr. Krane,"For those erudite readers writing reviews to respond to Ronald Krane's earlier review, you might want to branch out with the romans and read a little Seneca and Petronius, who both explore this strange beast, with which you are obviously not familiar, known as ""satire."" (In other words, methinks Mr. Krane may not be altogether serious.)"
4,not that bad,"Hi this review is largely inspired by the review by ronald kane, and partly in response to a review by a nineth grade prodigy following ronald's review. The book itself is grand, however i must agree that the rhyming (or lack there of) distracted me greatly. Jewel is a wonderful poet, so is michael bolton, i think that Virgil might (let me stress the word might here) have fashioned many of his stanzas on bolton's remake of ""when a man loves a woman"" (ie not always rhyming but beautiful nonetheless.) I feel that perhaps many poeple (namely pedantic nineth graders) will read this text and not truly grasp the depths of Virgil's musical backround and/or influences-- take more time with your next review little fellow... the book is not that bad."
3,not as good as the Odyssey!,"I didn't like the Aeneid as much as the Odyssey. I thought that it was not as interesting and I had trouble reading parts. It is basiclly the same story as the Odyssey, just not as good. If I hadn't already read the Odyssey, I probably wouldn't have finished this or liked it at all."
2,Vergil writes poor English verse,"What kind of poetry is this? The words don't even rhyme! I guess in Vergil's day there weren't so many rhyming words in English. It takes real a poet, like Maya Angelo or Jewel, to rhyme words properly. ""My hands are small, I know/ But they're not yours, they are my own."" Now THAT'S poetry.But turning to the plot of this ""poem,"" I don't understand what this Juno has against this Aeneas guy. He seems like a straight fellow, but she's always trying to drown him and stuff. And what's the big deal about Rome? It seemed so stupid that Aeneas had to go off and found this city and couldn't stay with that chick who killed herself. I've been to Rome. It's not all that great, and they don't even speak English. Aeneas is not a good role model for kids."
3,The Aeneid,"I expected this book to be in better condition but the book was full of underlining. Had I known, I would not have purchased"
4,Adequate translation,I read the Aeneid in its English translation by Rhoades in the Great Books of the Western World and was somewhat put off by the style. Fitzgerald's translation of this Latin classic reads easier and is likely to enjoy greater popularity. Since hardly anyone is familiar nowadays with the names of ancient Greek and Roman heroes the glossary at the back of the book is also very helpful.
1,Incorrect Version,"I wasn't sent the correct version I purchased. Instead I was sent the ""Penguin Classics"" version, translated by W.F. Jackson Knight. Since I needed the specific translation for a class, it was definitely an issue and I wasn't pleased."
2,"Good Story, Poor Translation","As another earlier reviewer appropriately stated, this book is not for a Classics Scholar. Having read a large number of different translations of the Aeneid and having translated about 80% of the text from the original Latin myself, Fitzgerald's translation here is lacking in many aspects. He does not keep with the same lines as the original text, he takes great liberties in the use of various words, and sometimes his grammatical poetics is overly drammatic for the section of translation. While the Aeneid is a poem, one must consider that an Epic poem is not a Haiku.If you're looking for an English translation to use in conjunction with a Aeneid translation course, seek another book. I prefered David West's translation when I was taking a few courses in college.The Aeneid is a wonderful story, just don't read Fitzgerald's translation of it."
4,Aeneas' Great Adventure to the Promise Land!,"Aeneis by Virgil is a classic of its time. I am required to read this book by my English teacher, but I would not put it down if he told me I didn't have to. This book gives a mythological account of the trials of Aeneas and the Trojan refugees after exiled from their homeland by the Greeks. Jupiter (the king of the gods) would have Aeneis found a colony that would eventually become an empire in Italy, while Juno (the queen of the gods) tries to delay Aenies' fate for as long as posible. Aeneis goes through many trials in this epic and if you enjoy history with a twist of fantasy and mythology then you will be hooked the moment you start into this book."
4,Aeneas' Great Adventure,"Speaking from a student's point of view, I think this book is challenging yet engaging. I am required to read this book by my A.P. English teacher. But if I wasn't required to read it, I still might read it if someone just told me that it was an adventure. I am hooked on adventure and this book has something for everyone in that department!"
2,Poor translation of a great work,"Robert Fitzgerald's translation of The Aeneid, while highly acclaimed, is a very low fidelity translation. Fitzgerald shows throughout the translation that he is an excellent writter, poet, etc. However, as a translator, his work is much below what I would have hoped. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald seems to have decided that Vergil was not as great a writer as himself in any way, because he blatantly ignores the Latin in his translation. While one would expect all translators to interpret The Aeneid in a different way, one should NOT expect them to completely paraphrase, cut out words, and add many extra ones to a quality translation, like Fitzgerald has. If you are not using this translation and comparing it to the original Latin, than this is a great read. However, if you are looking for a translation that holds high regard for the words of Vergil, look elsewhere, because Fitzgerald seeks not to translate the Aeneid, but to rewrite it as his own work."
2,Not for a Classics scholar,"I've read several English translations of The Aeneid, and have translated the majority of it. Unfortunately, this is not a terribly good translation. While it flows nicely, and keeps a poetic form, Fitzgerald takes far too many liberties with the Latin language for my tastes. It is difficult to follow along with the actual Latin text, as he does not keep the same lines as Virgil. My recommendation is Mandelbaum's translation; he sticks closely to the Latin."
4,Aeneas is the Man,"Robert Fitzgerald takes this Trojan-saga Rubix Cube and spins it to coordination with ease. For the average 17-year old high school senior, this story shouldn't be so easy to read, much less as compelling and entertaining as it was. I didn't find Fitzgerald's translation the least bit difficult to comprehend or enjoy. You can't help but agree, after finishing the story, that Aeneas is The Man."
2,"Good Translation, Poor Recitation","Although the translation is fine, the reading of this classic is marred by the voices of the actors. It's over the top and is distracting. I'm waiting for a rendition by Derek Jacobi."
2,Let Down,"This CD was extraordinarily difficult for me to find, and was a disappointment when I found it. The late great Mark Heard was playing around in his basement studio while drinking too much coffee or something. This is a blemish on an otherwise wonderful string of CDs."
1,disgraceful reviews,"You should not publish the two existing reviews, written by the daughter of the author and probably another relative for the sole effect of giving a five star rating"
1,bjam1207,item that was sent is differant than one in the pic order msx-256s they sent me a msx-m256s whitch is smaller and will not work my camera.Email them and they no atempt to correct the problem. One star because of price. I have since givin the memory stick away.e
3,a catholic professor on religious tolerance,"This book, although interesting, was not what I expected. First off, the vocabulary of the book is geared quite specifically toward catholic readers, in its use of latin and esoteric references. It's not an easy read. It does contain some good points about holding on to the christian faith through changing times, but it is presented in a bleak and pessimistic way. If you have the patience to wade through the language and negativity, it certainly makes a good point about staying open to new ideas while holding on to traditional beliefs."
4,Muy buenas.,"Son muy buenas memorias, tanto para hacer cosas de trabajos como para juegos, lo que las encuentro un poco caras."
5,Amazing!!!,"Son lo mejor que nunca he comprado!!! olvidense de latencias ustedes no se van a dar cuenta de eso, estas memorias en dual channel son bestiales para todo tipo de procesamiento, es mas estoy q me compro un par mas..."
2,Compatibility issues. Only recommended for enthusiasts/experts.,"This RAM is VERY picky as to what motherboards it's compatible with. Check the motherboard manufacturer's website. Note that even if the 2GBx2 or 4GBx2 kits are listed as compatible, this may not be. Even if your motherboard is compatible, you will likely need to do a BIOS upgrade or change timing or voltage settings. I have not seen these work in a motherboard strait from the box yet. And the current motherboard I'm aiming to use appears to be completely incompatible."
4,buenas pero no muy overclokeables,estas memorias mientras uno la deje en velocidad de stock son muy buenas. no son muy buenas para overclok pero cumplen su cometido.
4,"very good collection of BAP-songs, excellent live recording","BAP is a german band that was founded in the late seventies in Cologne. The front man 'Wolfgang Niedecken' writes all the lyrics, the guitarist 'Klaus (major) Heuser' is the main responsible for the music. All BAP-lyrics are Cologne-dialect, hence in their early days they were a local Cologne band. Meanwhile Bap is one of the major german bands well known also in the neighbouring countries.'Affrocke' is BAP's 2nd live album. It collects the main titles (some of them in a new version) as well as some new titles from the recent album 'X f√ºr en U'. For the international audience maybe especially interesting could be a cover version of the legendary David Bowie title 'Heroes' featuring Julian Dawson.Other interesting albums are:- Verdamp lang her (1979) - Kristallnaach (1980) - bess demn√§hx (1983, live) - Amerika (1997)"
2,"amusing illustrations, but incomprehensible for an ""intro""","I bought this book because I liked the idea behind it, introduce the thinkers in a comic book fashion. Also, I thought the ""Introducing Postmodernism"" was good. But this one on Foucault is a great dissapointment. The captions that narrate Foucault's development are mostly confusing: the explanation of the ideas just aren't clear enough, and the biographical anecdotes are mostly irrelevant. This doesn't give one a good understanding of what Foucault was trying to do, what his books tried to say, how his life influenced his work and v.v., and why, in the end, his ""work has become a straight jacket,"" as the author asserts."
3,all you need,"strange as it might seem, this might be all you need in order to understand Foucault before moving on to other more important thinkers in the late 20th century. It is a very effective quick tour if what you want is enough material to decide whether you need to read his translated works in full. My take on Foucault is that he was always more of a cult figure in the homosexual community celebrated more for his perverse public antics than for the originality of his ideas. Others have taken up similar post-Marxist ideas with more force and clarity. Foucault has become a passing reference that you may need on an exam. For that purpose alone this book (and the whole series of graphic introductions) are excellent. So on Foucault I give *, as and introduction to his work I give **, as a study guide I give *****."
5,An odd little punk rock collage-comic.,"This was an accidental find for me. I was looking up some ""serious"" philosophy for a discussion with a friend, and the bright colors and goofy cover struck me as... unusual, to say the least.In the long run, it was definitely worth my time; in the way of truly intelligent things, it managed to be a lot more informative and complex than I initially expected. Not only did it give a clear and concise overview of Foucault, but it referred to at least a dozen other thinkers and artists, and explained how they had influenced and been influenced by Foucault.As a side note, I also particularly appreciated the way it didn't dither around or hide from questionable material. I like a book that's equally ready to explain epistemes or leathersex.I just hope that, somewhere out there, Philosophy professors are using this book in curriculum. It's the kind of thing that would get even the densest student excited and thinking."
3,One winged Dragon,First thing out of the box and a wing broke off at the ball joint (It happened to the white one too). My son loves these knights and their swords but the durability of this toy is pretty poor. I'm going to try to exchange them for new ones and if the same thing happens again we'll break off the other wing and call them big lizards.
3,Great fun - but watch the wings!,"Before I purchased this item, I saw one in the store that had its wing broken off at the ball joint. I was a little concerned about how it would hold up for my 3-year-old, but thought it probably broke because some kid was a little over zealous at the store. Not so. My son didn't have this toy out of the package more than an hour, when I found it on the floor with one wing out of it's socket, and the other one broken at the ball joint. I'm going to exchange it, but if it happens again, he'll have a one-winged dragon, and he'll be making up creative stories about how it came to be so mamed."
2,ditto on quality,Had same experience as everyone else with this toy's wings before it came out of the box. This is now our fourth one - noticed that the wings on this one came packaged differently than the three previous purchases.
4,Brought tears to my eyes,"Darlene suffered terribly in the prisoner of war camp, but her faith remained strong throughout. God answered her prayers in wonderful ways. Fed only rice or gruel while in solitary confinement, one day she prayed for a banana, a single banana. She considered all the ways God could answer her prayer and deliver that banana. Through the guard? No... The night watchman? No... As she began to doubt that God could grant her that request, she was delivered an armload of bananas - 92 of them! - from the most unlikely source.I cried when I read how God worked in Darlene's life. She suffered greatly, but He was always close. Even the Japanese leader of her prison camp, a mean-spirited man, was affected by Darlene's witness and years later, accepted Christ.I, too, wish that she had written a sequel and told of her return to New Guinea after the war."
5,Outstanding,Her obedience will bring the reader to tears...many times over. Her courage will inspire. Her well-written account is polished such that it gleams. This is a unique story that will be difficult to put down. May her tenacity and reliance on God be contagious to all.
1,Language as if it had no music,"This is like listening to a Midwestern newscaster mangle a foreign language. Being from the Midwest myself, I think it is a fair criticism. I will never understand why academics treat language as if it has no music. Instead, try ""Koine Greek New Testament MP3 CD (Ancient Greek and English Edition)...Greek spoken by a native Greek."
3,Genetics vs Enviornment,"A lovely book that discusses very simply that the adoptive child is not chosen, but placed and often the birthfamily makes the choice. Also discusses that elusive term parenting in ways a child can understand, to teach them, hold them, change them, drive them to lessons and games, the meat and potatoes of daily life that a child can understand how much work being a parent is. The book is reassuring about the adoption process and shows what is genetic, like physical and personality characteristics, but there are few examples as to what the adoptive parents provide, an address, a name, family traditions and religion. Considering how hard parenting is, the adoptive parents do not seem to be providing much and come off worse for the comparision. A great concept, but leaves this adoptive parent cold."
4,"Now includes 24"" instead of 18"" clamps","The Bessey Uniklamps are my favorite clamps. Bought two more of these sets and was surprised to find the 18"" clamps have been replaced with 24"" clamps. Also the plastic heads on the long clamps are black instead of the usual gray. So it looks like Bessey is refreshing the Uniklamp line. I did notice on most of the clamps in this set, even the shorter ones, that the heads are canted in more rather than starting out parallel. It requires a lot more clamping force to bring them parallel. Some people who like to really clamp down on things may prefer that, but I don't like it as it tends to cause the parts to move around while you are applying the clamping force, so that is why I am knocking off one star."
4,Paul in Huntsville,The only complaint that I have with these clamps is that they are a bit tricky to adjust. I know that I will get use to them and otherwise they are GREAT.
2,I reach for these first,"I have several of the Bessey K-Clamps and while I like them allot, I always seem to reach for the Uniclamps. I probably wouldn't have bought them myself and received as a gift. I came to discover that they are light, powerful, easy to adjust and perfect for everything from clamping boxes to clamping up an edge glued top. I have bought others to add to the fold and now only use the K-clamps when I've run out of these.Edit as of Dec 2012: I've changed the rating from 5 to 2. The reason isn't that I don't find them handy, but rather that I'm noticing that they seem to have a shelf life of sorts. What I mean is that I've always used them for light clamping tasks (boxes, etc), but have thrown three away lately because they don't engage anymore. I've kept them free of glue and the bar still has serations, but the clamp portion won't catch them anymore. That makes them unusable."
4,Overall a good product,"While they are not as heavy duty as the K body clamps, they seem quite sturdy and functional. While I haven't had the chance to use them extensively, they seem to be well built and I am sure they will be the first clamps I use when I need medium duty clamps."
5,Great set of clamps,"The little brother of the Bessey K Body parallel jaw clamp. Works in the same way, only it is a smaller light-duty version. Great for small projects."
2,Description inaccurate,"This set, according to Bessey, has 24"" clamps substituted for the advertised 18"" clamps. The advertisement should be changed to reflect this."
3,Smushed,"When I received these, they were in a crushed box with a note from the shipping company that said, ""recieved from retailer damaged."" The socks were fine but the packaging was torn up so badly that I couldn't give them to her like that. (they were a gift)Why would a retailer send ssomething out that they know may be damaged?!?!?!"
2,Disappointing!,"I am old enough to remember all these songs when they were on the ""hit parade."" MANY were truly great songs. Unfortunately, for this collection, TOO MANY performances other than the famous ones were chosen. For example, there is Englebert Humperdink doing ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"" instead of the great Bette Midler! Some of the pieces are great; for those I gave the two stars. Overall, I think you are better off buying a ""best of"" CD of Andy Williams, Dean Martin, Lou Rawls or any of the other specific artists you like in this set."
3,Good BUT......Dragged on a bit.,"I found this sequel to be less fluent than the A:Dawn.Its story line was relfective of the situations presented in the first book.Leaving the storyline way open for another sequel..Although with the lack of Christian Military fiction around, it was a welcomed addition to my Library!I especially liked the twist at the end and again Mel Odom's obvious attention to detail which shows a keen interest in researching facts before meeting publisher deadlines. Which helps provide a realistic interpretation of Soldiers and their families during any conflict."
2,It Was OK...Not a Keeper,"A very light read. The beginning was fun with Richard and Isabel matching wits with one another, trying to out-do each other with their thievery. But then by the middle it started to slow down and I wasn't so involved any more. I found the love scenes to be one dimensional and too simple. I felt no heat whatsoever. The story just dragged on and on, I could even jump three paragraphs or a whole page ahead and not miss anything. I lost all interest in all of the characters. Not a keeper, IMO. For a great read, try her series starting with 'Once a Dreamer'."
5,Beautiful Cards!,"This is a gentle and beautiful deck. Soft watercolors, beautiful flowers, and delicate clouds surround a variety of lovely little faeries. Almost exclusively feminine, this deck is wonderful for self reflection, encouragement, or simply sitting around enjoying its beauty. Each card has a keyword on it, such as ""relax"", ""dream"", ""knowledge"" and the like. There is some mild, artistic nudity, so if that's an issue for you you might give this one a miss, but the majority of the faeries are clothed. I've not really been into faeries before, but this deck is so full of serenity and beauty that I'll be using it as a deck for personal reflections. It comes in a sturdy box with an accompanying book with full color pictures and words of encouragement tied to each card. If you like the artwork, I know you'll enjoy this deck."
3,ehhh..,"this book isn't bad, but it's not really all that revolutionary if you've trained in practical combatives (as a cop and soldier i have). if you haven't, then this book might offer more for you, philosphically..."
4,robust,"It is indeed a comprehensive book. It is theoretical, so you shouldn't buy it if you want a quick answers on a practical matter. You should buy it though if you want to acquire more in depth knowledge on European Customs law.Essential EU Customs Legislation 2012: R. Andringa"
2,Couldn't make it through one Colorado winter,"I live in the middle of the Rockies and a good set of wipers that can handle the snow and crust is hard to find. These were no exception. They worked great for the first month, then the inevitable streaking set in. By the end of the season, maybe 5 months, the protective cover/boot to keep the ice out of the frame was starting to disintigrate. Within a couple weeks of the first crack in the casing the rest of the rubber was flapping in the wind, coming off in chunks and being a general distraction and annoyance. Obviously out of warranty. Nothing to be done but get some new wipers and it won't be these again."
4,¬ø Quien dijo que la fusi√≥n no es El Camino ?,"Impactante presentaci√≥n de este grupo sevillano. Con su primer CD en el mercado, O'FUNK'ILLO no hacen sino augurar la descarga de energ√≠a musical que derrochan sus directos, cuya fama ya les precede. Con este trabajo han conseguido demostrar que la calidad no tiene porqu√© estar re√±ida con un lenguaje musical directo y contundente, en el que se mezclan con mucho humor todo tipo de influencias (funk, rock, flamenco, etc...) dando un combinado fresco, explosivo y original donde cada uno de los m√∫sicos brilla con luz pr√≥pia, destacando el cantante y el espl√©ndido bajista Pepe Bao. Imprescindible para entender el incierto futuro del ""rock""."
1,Disappointed,"As a hitori fan, I was very disappointed in this book. The reason I chose this particular book was for the hitori puzzles and they are all flawed. For those of you familiar with hitori, there are blacked out numbers with no reason for black out, and also circled numbers with no reason to circle. Leaves the puzzles unsolvable."
3,1/4 of the book is useless,"It is great to see more of Nikoli's puzzles becoming popular, and indeed the Masyu and Nurikabe puzzles in this book are great fun and are a refreshing change from the more standard Sudoku and Kakuro, which this book also contains.Unfortunately, the author completely misunderstood how Hitori is supposed to work, so those 100 puzzles (1/4 of the book) are next to useless. When introducing and explaining Hitori, he states the rules correctly, but one hint he gives (""If a number is unique to both its row and column, then it must be white"") does not follow from the rules. All of his Hitori puzzles do not work out unless you invoke this ""hint"". And some of them do not work out even if you do invoke it.I give the book 3 stars because the other sections of the book have given (and still are giving) me hours of puzzle-solving enjoyment."
1,Too many errors to be much fun,"I enjoy various of the kinds of puzzles presented here, particularly Masyu. But about 10% of the puzzles in this book fail to have a unique solution, which every one of them is supposed to have, and after a while that becomes intolerable. There are other books that feature each of these kinds of puzzles, and I recommend that you buy those instead."
1,Very poorly edited - shamefully bad,"I am a beginner at Hitori and was stunned to realize that most of the Hitori solutions in the book are invalid. Mepham or his editors seem unaware of the basic rules of the puzzle. Other reviewers have noted similar problems and even said that the publisher has acknowledged the errors. The puzzles lose all of their relaxing, mind absorbing qualities when the book is so poorly created. Shamefully bad material carrying the name of a (supposedly) great puzzle creator. One star."
2,Duplicate Puzzles,As an avid Kakuro solver I found the kakuro puzzles some of the toughest I've seen. I also enjoyed the variety of other puzzles in the book. Even some Sudoku are quite difficult. And I'm a guy who tends to start with the toughest first.I am disappointed in several things though. The solutions to the Hitori are inaccurate and there is much repetition in the puzzles. I have not actually looked for duplicates but have found a half dozen or more *exactly* duplicated puzzles.
2,"Nice idea, but the puzzles have problems","Really the only good thing I can say about this book is that it introduced me to a variety of puzzles beyond Sudoku. Being a fan of Sudoku, I was excited to learn about some other Japanese puzzles. I flipped through this book in a bookstore and it seemed like a good purchase, but after having spent quite a few hours with this book I discovered the same problems other reviewers have, e.g. wrong solutions, multiple solutions, repeat puzzles, ambiguous difficulty, etc. It's been an annoying journey with this book.If you are interested in Masyu, Nurikabe, Kakuro, or Hitori, look somewhere else."
5,Revenge Poems,"I am the vocalist on this CD! I just wanted let those that are fans that Carmina Piranha are in the studio recording their next album. The release date is in June. Stay tuned! Also, our new website will be available in April!"
5,GO!,"First off I want my sister to know how proud I am of her and of course the Band. I saw the band in Austin, Texas at the South by Southwest concert and I really enjoyed the music. I am waiting for the NEXT CD!!!!Keep up the Great work."
5,Great sounds from talented women,"When I heard Carmina Piranha play at the ballet with Oregon Ballet Theater I just had to have the CD. It was sold in the lobby. I bought 2 and have enjoyed the vibrant, stirring music and meaningful, touching lyrics nearly daily. If you like harmony mixed with hard rock and intellegence then try this groups first solo CD."
5,WOW-WEE,"True Intentions was a wonderful, exciting,and great book .I will recommend every one male and female to read this page turning book .I could not put this book down I almost read it in one day it is truely that good.All of you out there need to go get this book!Halema is a GREAT writer and I can't wait for her next book to come out.If you don't have Mass Deception go get it so you can keep up with what Toni Goodwin is doing.Thanks amazon for having this book in stock . Krives@unch.unc.edu"
5,Amazing,"Hallema is the next big thing! I've read both of her novels and I must say that if I knew where she lived I would knock on her front door and demand a copy of the next one, but since I don't I guess I will have to wait for ""Wishful Thinking"" like everyone else,but for those who haven't read her first two jaw dropping novels you have a lot of catching up to do!"
3,Still a good-fun story,"I read ""True Intention"" and I still like the story. The writing is a little better. It is a good-fun read and I can't waited until the next story,""Wishful Thinking"". Good Job."
2,More for the ballet dancer than not,"I'm a total Physique 57 fan and have been religiously doing the DVDs every day of the week, but I just wanted to add a little something different to my routine. You get a good workout with this video, BUT if you're not flexible it is very difficult. Tracey moves very fast and all of the exercisers in her video are very flexible. I found this very discouraging because I can't stretch my legs out that far and when she gets going fast it's difficult to keep up. Also, there are no video shots from the side, so it's hard to tell what angle they are actually kicking their legs. More instruction in this video would have been very helpful along with someone not a dancer showing abbreviated moves."
5,Nothing better out there,"I have had this DVD for about 5 weeks and I can honestly say that I cannot get enough.It is very challenging (for me - I am 66 yrs old) and every time I do this I want to achieve more. (Can I get that leg up higher?). (Can I do the arm routine with heavier weights?)I have practiced with a barre and a chair. To be honest the chair works better.The arm work is excellent as well. Increasing the weights adds to the challenge.My only complaint is the ab routine, it is way too short. But then this is designed for the booty and legs more than anything else.After the Abs section there is a very good flexibility section. Again a minor complaint, I would have preferred that this section had been separated from the Abs in order that it could have been selected from the menu without having to go through the abs first.Sometimes I run out of time.I think all ages will enjoy this one."
5,good workout,"I bought this DVD to go along with my Barre and while it does not fit 100% of the bill for what I was looking for, it is a happy mistake. I am a dancer (though not a ballerina) and have been in sports all my life (now > 50) and thought I was in good shape and this DVD has taught me some humility. Never underestimate the value of cross-training. I started out doing the entire DVD in one morning from start to finish which made me sore but if you are active you understand the meaning of ""a good kind of sore"". I cannot do everything in the DVD yet but I did what I could and kept moving and did the variations she teaches and did not stop. But if her students (who are in the video) can do it then so can I. I plan to use this at least 3 times per week in addition to my other dance and the New York City Ballet Work Out on YouTube in between. I am motivated to complete this as they do in the DVD and feel certain this will strengthen me and augment my balance."
5,Great Workout,"I've only used it a few times, but from what I can tell is that it is a great workout. I've always been athletic, but this totally works muscles you didn't even know you had!"
3,different...I'm on the fence,"This is my first barre workout and I didn't know what to expect. I've been doing all the standby's...jillian, the firm, jackie warner and my new favorite Jessica Smith. This is very different from all of them. Can't say I like it a ton, but didn't hate it. I agree with the reviewer that said it's not for the inflexible. I like that it's less like traditional cardio (they all exercise in bare feet) but it's not slow like yoga, and it's hard. However not being able to complete the moves with any grace was frustrating. I gave up toward the end of the long workout and I can't remember the last time I stopped a workout before it was over. I'll keep it in my rotation but it won't be the first (or second or third) one I reach for."
4,This workout will kick your booty (into shape),"This is a tough but fun workout!Tracy is an upbeat instructor, and not at all annoying. The tough part is really just the workout -- your muscles will be trembling, if you push yourself.I liked that there is not a long intro at the beginning of the DVD (no wasting time with additional ads!). The arms, booty, and abs workout can be done altogether for a killer workout. Or, you can split them up to alternate muscle groups."
1,DVD does not work on computer,I was excited to try this DVD as I have done Xtend Barre at a studio for awhile. I bought quite a few barre/fusion/pilated DVDs with this order. I purchased two Tracey Mallette DVDs and neither one would work on my new Macbook Pro. The other DVD's worked so I know it is something with the formatting of this series that will not work on Mac's DVD player. Just thought I would give a heads up to anyone who plans to follow this workout from their Mac or computer. BUMMER!
2,Not what I thought,"All the reviews were great for this DVD but if you've ever been to an actual barre class, this is nothing like it. There's way too much cardio to be called a Barre DVD. I prefer the Bar Method Dancer's Body Advanced workout."
2,Really annoying,"I should have known that this workout wouldn't be to my taste from the beginning - I mean booty barre?? I was looking for a more straighforward ballet workout - and of course that naturally works your butt. But I found Tracey to be way too cutesy. As in, lots of ""shake that booty!"" I expect that in a cardio DVD, but it seemed out of place in a ballet-based workout. You can definitely get a good workout with this DVD: this has probably the best arm workout of any of my ballet DVDs. It's tough and I really like this section. But my overall judgment is the same, I just found her to be so grating.The Element Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan is more my speed."
2,I Expected Something Different.,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews, but quickly found this DVD was not for me. I will compare ""The Booty Barre Total New Body"" to an exercise video from the 80's: the bubbly instructor chirping away during the exercises and the no pain no gain style of exercises. To add to that, I did not appreciate the warm up which was not much of a warm up! I am enjoying ""Bellydance With... Jillina: Shape Up n' Hip Out!"" instead of the The Booty Barre-Total New Body."
3,Pedestrian interpretation but good sound,"Andrew Litton help;d revitalize the always endangered Dallas Sym., and his Mahler cycle has been recorded in excellent sound -- even the major companies are hard pressed to equal it. But he has no real affinity for the composer. This is a straight-ahead Fifth with regular tempos and an even disposition. It will appeal primarily, I think, to listeners who don't want Mahler interpreted in the first place. For me, everything is too bland and faceless, but I did enjoy the warm, detailed sonics. There are excellent Mahler Fifths at the budget level, especially one on Naxos led by James DePriest. It has more vitality than Litton's amble through the score."
5,Muy bueno !!!!1,Uno de los primeros discos de el consorcio el cual no he dejado de escuchar una y otra vez. C√≥mprenlo no se arrepentiran.
4,Decent laptop support,"This is a pretty handy, folding laptop table. It helps the laptop to stay cooler and fits easily into a backpack. Opened, it does feel a little flimsy and I usually left it folded with my laptop sitting up on both halves. I run the power cord in between the 2 halves and that is a huge help keeping the power cord from getting pulled out."
2,Why the quality changed??,I bought two of them. One a few weeks after the other. The first one was good. I'm still using it. But the second one was a completely different thing. The material was cheap and the craft was shabby. It broke only in a few weeks. Why the product changed so much for the same product ID??
2,not the same of the picture,"this lapdesk from the picture is just great, sadly is the old version, the new one is on black and is to fragile, easy to broke...they sell you the picture but they give you the new one. if you buy it be very careful when you use it, mine is already broken. :("
5,lapdesk,"This lapdesk is a handy item. Better than having the laptop in direct contact with your legs.Yes, you can still feel some heat from the laptop.I use the right side to position my trackball."
2,Right model but wrong style,"I order the Targus PA243U Portable lapdesk which is the gray solid. However, the item that they delivered is not the same as what is in the picture which is the gray solid lapdesk. What I got is the brown lapdesk with open slot and it is thinner than the gray lapdesk that if you try to lift you could see it bending in the middle because it so thin and can't hold the weight of the laptop. The heat from the laptop also travels between the open slot so if you have this on your lap you could feel the heat on your legs."
2,Not what was shown.,"I wasn't expecting much, but what I got is NOT what is shown at all. It is full gray, with only a few small rubber pads. I wanted a light, cheap, wide laptop tray so I could place my laptop across my knees when sitting cross-legged, but the entire thing began to break within weeks of purchase. The very sides started first, cracking where I'd pick it up and where the closures are. A few months later, the entire middle just snapped except for one small part of the hinge. It's being held together with duct tape until I get a good laptop tray.Do not expect it to hold anything over 5 pounds, and do not expect it to last even a few months. Not a good buy."
2,A less than study laptop desk,"The Targus PA24SU notebook desk is an interesting attempt at providing both cooling and a convenient lap desk in one unit. I really wanted to like this product and the price was right. Unfortunately the lapdesk turned out to be a bit of disappointment. The laptop desk turned out to be un-sturdy and rather flimsy. Worst, the unit actually became hot when using my laptop over prolonged periods of time. During usage the unit also did not dissipate heat very well from the laptop. This may be more from my own laptop's odd size (16 inch) but the unit definitely did not help with cooling. Plus, for those that like to use a regular mouse with their laptop, the unit is really awkward to use on its own. The narrow ends tend to make it easy for either the laptop or mouse pad to overhang the edges. Not recommended."
3,good for the $,"I needed a simple riser for my laptop. For the money this is a good little item. It suits my purpose. However, it is a bit flimsy and has a habit of suddenly snapping closed. I don't recommend it for mobile, or long term use."
1,piece of junk,You get what you pay for. This thing is so flimsy you can't even move your computer on it. Don't waste your money.
2,waste of money,"As with many things Targus, this is overpriced cheap plastic and it may keep your lap cooler, but doesn't do a thing for cooling your notebook in any possible way. It also in the Unfolded position, 1. doesn't fit widescreen laptops well as there is no room for a mouse and 2. probably will break if I lifted it onto my lap. I use the folded position to use the tilt function. It's still overpriced for what you get. I'd say it's worth $10 but probably made for about $2. I've owned this for 2 months now and the rubber standoffs don't work very well anymore and the notebook doesn't stay put in tilt anymore. (that and it will eventually rip my COA's off the bottom of the Notebook.)"
