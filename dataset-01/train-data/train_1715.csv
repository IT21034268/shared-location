1,Disappointed,I never got the movie or any e-mail from the seller!!!! + I never got money back! don't buy anything from this seller!!!!
3,Almost cool,"This movie was almost clever, almost witty and almost cool. The biggest absence was the lack of interesting and engrossing characters. Entertaining but not satisfying. However, it does have a very cool opening scene."
2,Pretentious Nonsense,So they think if they can put some realistic effects for violence they can make a good Tarantinoesque picture. I don't care. This movie is a waste of time.
4,Almost Great,"This film is enthralling, and I would have given it five stars had it not so resembled Tarantino's work. Skip Woods includes real human beings among his characters, going well beyond Tarantino's standard soulless cartoon hipsters. ""Thursday"" says some things about life changes, karma, love, and - without a doubt - luck. The review (above) claiming a "" lack of interesting and engrossing characters."" Please. Casey is one of the most interesting characters I've seen in a long while. His wife, the coffee shop waitress-turned-ironpants career ice queen, plays a small but pervasively significant part. Watch this movie."
4,Great movie,This is an awesome movie. It's just a shame it didn't get enough publicity to warrant more production. I can't find this DVD anywhere. If you like Boondock Saints you'll probably like this.
3,let's get real here,"Okay, all these other people must be teenagers. I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't Casablanca or even Pulp Fiction. And none of them mentioned my favorite thing about it, which was Paulina Poritzkova (sp?). Fun, nonethelesss."
2,Like Watching 2 Crackheads Fighting Over a Lighter,"You know it's a waste of time, very scuzzy and kind of pathetic, yet you're compelled to sit there and watch. I could not believe the sheer badness of this movie. I turned it off halfway through on Tuesday night, but forced myself to finish it on Wednesday.It was bad, it was bad, it was bad... and then Mickey Rourke showed up. Then it was just sad. All that's left of Mickey Rourke is his bone structure.However the film DOES manage to demonstrate from a technical perspective just how female on male rape could be managed, so it wasn't a total waste of time."
1,Stupid!!!!Stupid!!!!!!!!!Trash!!!!!!!!!,I cannot believe people liked this piece of junk movie. the only reason why people are selling this so high is because it is out of print and it has to do with drugs...........Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie because it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Hard-to-Find Gem,"I rented Thursday about a decade ago and was blown away by the performance of Thomas Jane. His charismatic portrayal of a very bad man gone domesticated was mesmerizing and watching him try to uphold his perfect suburban life while his past comes back to haunt him is hoot to watch. When he finally cracks and the raw emotion of his situation boils over, its a scene that still resonates. The cast is rounded out by a collection of interesting character actors including Mickey Rourke, Aaron Eckhart & Paulina Porizkova who all make this one rowdy Tarantionesque ride. Buy it if you can find it!"
1,Battery Dies,The battery in my Jabra headset won't hold a charge after about 3 months use and can't be replaced. Buy something else.
1,Just Static and feedback,"I purchased this product NEW IN BOX, but from CompUSA, which is going out of business - all sales final. The static is outrageous on this thing - 60-70% of the time, even if I hold my phone 2 feet away (at which point, why even have a bluetooth?!??!) And if I turn up the volume to hear over the static, the listener gets serious feedback. This is ridiculous! I tried it with both my ATT Iphone AND my US Cellular Motorola Razor. Bad reception everytime = TERRIBLE static if I even move my arm between the phone and the headset; inaudible if I turn my head away. And yes, it IS on the same side of my body. MY GOSH - I even tried it TWO FEET AWAY. Just irritating static!"
3,Fits good but stopped pairing with my Treo,"I loved this headset until it stopped pairing with my Treo. All of a sudden it won't recognize and is unable to pair. Still shows up on my list of devices, but that is it. The fit was great however. Since the price has come down, I may purchase same model again or try another model of the same brand instead. The way it fits makes it the best product for me."
2,Range,"This unit is as great as the other reviewers say,except for the range.I can't get more than six feet away before the static is intolerable.I have a Motorola phone.I have used an HS810 for well over a year with this phone,with great range,btw."
1,NOT new as advertised,"I should have noticed by the fact thet both packages were closed with scotch tape. I ordered two of these headsets ( one for back up ), because I like them and they are no longer available. Well, within a couple of days, I noticed light coming from the side of the unit I was using. There was a crack in the side of the unit!!! I am not abusive, so it was there!!! Well, time to charge up the second unit... opps can't do that - it won't charge. The question you may be asking is why did I not address this with the shipper, I was going to today .... now I have"
2,Comfortable but lousy bluetooth connection,"The earpiece is comfortable. When it worked, I enjoyed using it. But, the Bluetooth connection to my Motorola Razr phone was spotty at best. In the middle of about 33% of my calls, I would get a ""bluetooth connection weak"" message from my phone, even though I was holding the phone in my hand, 2 feet from the phone. Disappointing performance to say the least.UPDATE: Turns out the problem was really with the phone, not the ear piece."
5,The vibrate feature is a plus . . .,"I have three of these, like the vibrate feature since I work in a noisy environment and sometimes wouldn't realise that a call was being received. This is very comfortable to use if you don't wear glasses. With glasses I'd prefer to have an extension to the eargel. It's easy to forget you're wearing this light-weight earpiece. I got three so I could switch to another if one of them failed and was no longer available as they are now. I have had issues with others not being able to hear me, this may be the phone though. I've used this with an LG Dare and now with an LG Touch. No problem pairing but a short separation between the phone and the headset produced static. To eliminate this, I usually have the phone in my pocket on the same side as the earpiece. I need to select another BT headset because of my now having to wear glasses but I wish there was an eargel extension instead. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the performance of this Jabra product."
3,No better than the other ones,Every bluetooth headset I have owned have their problems and this one is no different. I have to take the phone out of its pouch so I can hear clearly but it is good then. People can hear me fine. I like the fact that it vibrates. It is not comfortable at first but you will get used to it. I am still in search of the best bluetooth headset.
1,Poor Design,"The Headset is to big for a ""regular"" ear.it comes with a charging cradle that needs adjustment every time you trying to charge.i used to have the Jabre BT5020 it is much better except of the ear ""nipple"" that came off every time i used it.don't recommend to buy this headset!"
3,Jabara BT250 not as slim,I recently purchased the Jabra BT 250 for my associate as I had been using a Jabara for some time (the older version of the 250) and love it. Since they were priced well I ordered one for myself just in case my old one went out. I switch out and use both now however the older version is much slimmer and gets the same reception. This is an exceptional product which ever one you use. We have gone through MANY cell phone ear pieces and Jabara is the ONLY one we have found to be all day comfortable and has great reception.
2,Poor Clarity (All the time),"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Jabra products, over the past 7 years I have had several Jabra Bluetooth headsets. I purchased the BT 250 only after my BT 500 battery stopped working, the old unit was ""AWSOME"" no clarity issues. The BT250 has a crackeling noise that you hear in the headset even when your not talking on the phone, this could be an isolated issue with the unit that I purchased????I returned the unit and purchased a jawbone."
5,A little something different for the bass headz!,Ok... Here's the deal!If you are a Magic Mike fan you will love the cdreguardless of the style of music...If you are a PEB fan you will love it because it is trueto his style..These two bass lords - combine ideas and bring bass to awhole new level... It's a great cd - just not the hip-hopMike we are used to... Check out Mike's other titlesthey are all 5 star lp's!
1,it sucks,"this is teh worst bass CD I've ever bought. It barely pumps my 20,000 watt speakers. It sucks for bumpin' and grindin'"
5,This one is a keeper!!!!,"Robyn has done it once again. I loved this thrilling suspense, yet dashing love story. Coco was full of laughs, and Jax was tempting altoghether. Jax tried to his best to keep Coco at armslength, but Coco broke down his resistance. I loved the way he threw her over his shoulder when his feelings towards her changed. Caveman!! I like it. Adrian and Mr. Thorp got exactly what they deserved. Jail time!!. However, I was sort of dissappointed with the ending. I was hoping that Jax and Coco developed a more permanent relationship. Say like, marriage !! Nevertheless, it was a good read. I've read all of Robyn's books and I enjoyed all three of them. I can't wait to read Blue's story. Keep up the good work!! Until next time."
5,This tool is a lifesaver!!,This tool is an absolute lifesaver! I was able to quickly AND accurately install (80) 12' pieces of siding with NO HELP! I HIGHLY recomend this product...
5,Great tool but confusing marketing,"I work alone most of the time. I purchased a set (thats 2 identical items) of the metal fixture (whatever it's name is.. overlap guage or facing guage) I do not own the plastic device. I use the 2 guages with hardiplank. The Hardiplank itself sets the overlap; 5-1/4"" Hardiplank is used for 4"" siding reveal, 6-1/4"" Hardiplank for 5"" reveal, and so on. The fixtures I purchased are indispensible if you work alone. The 12' Hardiplanks are heavy and, for lack of a better word, ""floppy"". The fixtures make quick work of putting them up. This is a must have tool if even if you are only doing your house BUT buy two of the metal fixtures and buy the right width hardiplank to get the reveal you need. Hint: Check the reveal every 2nd or third Hardiplank because as good as the fixtures are they are not perfect and an error can accumulate."
1,The picture will deceive.,"I have not used this set yet so I don't know how well it is going to work. Appears it will work pretty well.Be aware that it comes with the facing guage and only ONE of the overlap gauges, not two as the picture would imply."
4,"Great Music, Too Short","Well, to sum this CD up I would say all the songs on this CD blew me out of the water. They are absolutely amazing. The music is in your face, and it's great. There are 7 songs on this CD, which isn't all that bad. The one thing that gets to me is that the running time on this CD is only about 11 and a half minutes. That's the only reason I gave this a 4 star, because the music is great. I just felt kinda ripped off with only 11 minutes of music. This CD will cost you about a buck a minute. It's up to you to get this, but the music does kick butt, just be prepared to have a new CD to listen to afterwards, because it's over before it gets started."
5,Eating Stella Style,"*THE* best cookbook I own and I own tons! I have celiac disease. I absolutely must follow a gluten free diet which means I cannot have the gluten found in wheat, rye and barley. I also cannot have anything derived from these grains which, in the ""normal"" American diet, means I cannot have a lot of things and eating in restaurants is almost a nightmare. With this cookbook, by George, he has it! Every recipe, but one, is gluten free and that one recipe can easily be made gluten free by substituting the wheat bran with any other GF flour as the wheat bran is only used to ""flour"" the pan. I absolutely cannot sing the praises for this cookbook long enough or high enough. Everyone should own a copy of this book - gluten free, low carb, reduced carb, low calorie or not! Get it!"
3,Great Recipes--Poor Book Construction,"I love the recipes in this book--everything is incredibly delicious. I really like the muffin recipes--the banana nuffins and spice muffins are the best--and the key lime cheesecake recipe is fantastic as well. My favorite main dish recipe is the Meatloaf Rollatini, which I stuff with different ingredients every time. I love that the net carbs are listed for each serving and that the same ingredients are used for many of the recipes, so I can buy those in bulk to have them on hand. This book has made it very easy to eat low carb because the food is never boring.I'm giving this rating a 3 because I was very dissappointed in the book construction--the pages separated from the spine the first time I gently laid the book open to have it lay flat on my counter. At this point the pages are being held in the book by a clip until I glue it back in myself."
3,stella fan,Book content was good. Many useful recipes. Tried a few and liked them. Book content is not best suited for kindle fire. Cookbooks are probably better in print. PIctures were not available and pictures make the cookbook more interesting. Quick flipping between recipes is easier with a print edition.
1,Healthy Cooking - Where's the Nutritional Information???,"I believe that healthy eating includes balancing low carb, low fat and high fiber whole foods in the diet. When I heard about this book I thought it would be a nice addition to my Cooking Light and Healthy Cookbooks in an effort to add some low carb menu ideas. I considered this a ""healthy"" cookbook and did understand that George's key eating focus is ""low carb"". However, I was completely shocked to find that George does not include nutritional information for his recipes!Any chef/cook promoting healthy eating should know that it is a balancing act and that like another reviewer, artificial ingredients (i.e. sugar substitues) should not be used. This book will probably get donated."
5,Improving on perfection!!,"Stellas, you have outdone yourself again!! This cookbook is chock full of inpsiring wonderful recipes, so easy and delicious, not to mention an incredible peek into who I consider the ""first family of health"". Thank you again for all the hard work, it shows on every page!! To anyone out there considering a change in their way of eating and are a bit intimidated by it?....Get this book!!!!"
5,The Best Yet!!!,This is one of my favorite George Stella books. I like it more than the newest book on the market.
4,good book,"The recipes are not bad, although there are an awful lot of variations on scrambled eggs (frittatas, etc.) It's still a very solid book that contains many unique, original recipes for a LC lifestyle and there are also adjustments in the book where you can go the more low fat route. The flexibility was surprising."
4,Wonderful recipes!!,Wonderful recipes!! Have bought both of George's books and probably will buy his new one!!Loved almost all of the recipes!!
5,The best low carb cook book,"I purchased this cookbook a while ago, but thought I should come back and review it due to its quality and amazing recipes. If you are on a low carb diet, and need new and delicious recipes, this book is for you! Every single recipe I've tried has been wonderful, and even my family members that are not on a low carb diet love them. And the before-and-after pictures of George Stella and his family are like ""WOW!"" ...Combined with his knowledge of nutrition, and food, and chef background is like ""Double WOW!"" Buy this, even if you have lots of other low carb cookbooks. You won't be disappointed!!"
4,Campy old style sci-fi TV,"Compared to a few of the old TV series, I consider this one of the best. I had purchased some of the VCR tapes a few years ago but the DVD provides better quality. There are just a few of the episodes from the series on the DVD but well worth the price if you are into nostalgia sci-fi."
3,Interesting but not great,Gave this 3 stars only because something compelled me to read even though I didn't always enjoy what I was reading. I had trouble with the major character being a priest (my issue) and the lack of interaction he had with the other characters (other that the archangel). Also at times I found the priest and his ideas rather annoying. Hey I still read it and will probably read the next one too.
3,I thought the same thing.,"I basically agree with the other reviewers. I was so turned off by the blatant and flagrant evil of the church....and its consistancy with current events in the US..it was very difficult to keep going. I kept flashing on the incredible ignorance and gullibility of all classes of people and wondering how this state could have come about. I persevered primarily because I have enjoyed her books in the past and candidly hoping for some sort of redemption to give me hope in the dark times we are enduring in Budhieland. Didn't end very well, but perhaps there is a glimmer of hope as our anti-hero at least abandons the Church."
2,Really horrible writing,"Sara Douglass has a somewhat interesting plot here, but her terrible writing makes it almost impossible to follow. While there's been a slight improvement since the horrific Wayfarer Redemption, in which points of view changed within the same paragraphs, the clunking prose and the simpering dialog is still abundant, and the constant taint of amateurish style is never far away.Perhaps it would behoove Ms. Douglass to find a collaborator with whom to write. She could provide her insight and plot ideas, based on whatever scholarship she has attained, to a genuine wordsmith. Maybe then the work would be readable."
1,review from an avid sara douglass reader...,"[...]This book, however, was completely awful! I read to page 240 (about halfway through the book) and still couldn't get into the story... I have read historical novels about the plague era that I enjoyed... but this is awful...All that seemed to happen for 240 pages was that a monk with a bad attitude and no ability to think for himself goes from place to place looking for his predecessor Wynken's book to banish demons to hell... but as he searches, all that seems to happen is he calls women [...] and thinks most humans are evil... He experienced a tragedy that made him seek the church but rather than the tragedy tempering his heart with empathy and understanding, he becomes a misanthropic close-minded pig. I found that by the middle of the book, only one ending would satisfy... that some horror befall the horrid monk...SARA DOUGLASS IS AN AMAZING AUTHOR... BUT READ THE WAYFARER REDEMPTION SERIES OR ENCHANTER..."
4,A fascinating time in English and French history,"I enjoyed Douglass' ""Threshold"" a few years ago and looked forward to trying some of her series. This is the first book in the series ""The Crucible,"" which takes place in the 14th century in the years following The Black Plague, an interesting and turbulent period in Europe. Thomas, a Dominican friar, is visited by St. Michael, who tells him that demons abound in Europe and that it is his life's task to stop them. Although I didn't love it, I'll definitely finish the series. Another wonderful book that takes place during this time period is ""Katherine"" by Anya Seton."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the two reviews here, I was looking forward to getting this book and putting the information to use. There is, however, a major flaw with this book. You can buy and read it but NOT be able to put the ideas into practice. You need to buy Renee's special cards so you can tell which color group your clothes fit into.I am not even sure I really know which color group I fit into. The information on deciding your own color group is minimal: three pages. On the page devoted to which eye color fits into which category, there are NO green eyes! Am I the only person with green eyes?The book tells you how fantastic the color system is but then you can't use it without Renee's cards or having a personal color session at one of her salons. I felt like I bought an advertisment!"
1,What a waste of money!,"This book only has a few pages of text and photos that actually discuss how to find your own coloring. It is mostly about her life and shows other people and their before and after photos. Some of those people looked better before she chose their colors! I ordered her color tools too and they are an extreme waste of money unless you are wanting to paint your house. The colors certainly aren't good for anything else. Definately a buyer beware, don't waste your money."
5,Chocolate food of the gods,This has been a very interesting and complete history of chocolate. I've learned so much I had no idea!!
3,What You Should Know,"My printer came with my Home Internet Appliance, so I didn't CHOOSE it. I've tried compatible cartridges, but the color is wierd, so you really have no choice but to buy Epson Genuine Cartridges. I think they personally sell their printers at reasonable prices, and then ""GET"" you on the ink jet cartridges. As everyone else has stated, you do not get the promised amount of pages per cartridge."
3,Quality but expensive,"I don't use the printer a lot. My work is largely limited to printing text but I seem to replace the color cartridges every few months. The price here is better than an office supply store but still expensive. The color is beautiful, near photo quality on photo paper. The printer will not let you print black and white text if you are out of *color* ink."
4,Not bad,"Everyone keeps complaining that the cartridge is expensive and they can't use generic. Sadly, thas becoming the industry standard--you can't blame this one printer. I have to print pages and pages of detailed notes and figures every day and I haven't had to replace the ink more than once so far.The ink saver setting is very faint."
3,ONLY FOR EPSON 777,"My Epson-777 printer died for good, after two very usefull years.Now I just found out that EPSON ink cartriges can only be used by one kind of printer and I'm stuck with 5 color and 4 black cartrigdes I cannot return, this is about 200 dlls.Now I change to a HEWLETT PACKARD, with their printers you can use the same kind of ink cartriges on several kind of printers. Hopefully I won't end up with another 200 dlls. waist."
4,Super Ball Shoes,Good qualtiy shoes and a great design. The super balls are molded in the bottom heal area of the shoe. My son is convinced that he can jump much higher now!
4,BOYS SPORTS SHOES,NICE LOOKING SHOES...BUT THEY RUN TOO BIG. MY SON HAS TO WAIT A WHILE BEFORE THEY FIT WELL...THIS IS A SHAME!...THEY RUN LIKE ONE AND A HALF NUMBER BIGGER...THANKS ANYWAY SINCE THE PRICE IS WORTH IT!
1,not like on TV,"My grandson saw these on TV and HAD to have them. So, I went to Amazon and ordered them. They arrived promptly and fit fine. However all the jumping high into the air, great fun....nope regular sneakers. Now he is so disappointed he won't wear them. Sigh"
5,WoW,"If you are from LA or have lived in LA for some time, you will LOVE this video. Its like going home."
3,Bad But Good,"Entertaining low budget action/...flick about the russian mob, undercover cops, hookers and strippers with a heart of gold and half japanese samurai dudes with killing on their minds. New Concorde (Roger Corman) produced and distributed effort is isn't as bad as it looks but isn't that good either. What it has going for it is some great editing, surprisingly appealing leads and a whole lot action. ..."
3,If I could help direct for Roger Corman,"When there are any films that involve Roger Corman, you are going to see low budget film with an excess of nude women with big boobs. The concept of the story of a rebellious young yakuza severs ties with his family in order to form an alliance with the Russian mob only for it to go completely wrong after that same guy tries to rape a dancer that's involved with the nephew of the Russian mob [stupid move]. The yakuza rebel doesn't even look japanese, and his body guards look like bad extras from the matrix. The choreography was cheesy at times, but I do give corman credit for throwing more action into his films. The only two people that I feel did a good job in this movie was the old cop and the hooker. This movie had a good concept, but badly executed."
1,lid will not attach,Our lid fails to attach -- even approximately -- even after I read all the reviews here. I'm tempted to say something rude about it.
5,Makes Florida water taste good!,I didn't think it would be able to take the terrible taste out of Florida tap water (which tastes like drinking from a pool) but it did. The result is water that tastes extremely like some of the big brand names from the supermarket.The design is a bit funky but it was worth every penny. Try it! I'm very excited about all the money I'll be saving on bottled water.
2,very disapponted,"At first we were very happy with this filter. Brought it from the store, washed it with soap, soaked the filter, filled it not letting the water fall on the filter and put it in the fridge, did everything the instructions said. The tap water taste was markedly improved. However, after about 2 weeks, the container, the filter and the water it holds developed a very unpleasant smell. I do not see the algae, so it probably are bacteria. Needless to say, the pitcher is mostly in the fridge, nobody drinks from it directly, it just does not make sense! Washed it really well with soap again. After a few days the smell was back. Threw away the filter and bought a new one. After less than a week it is back again! I suppose the filters themselves must be contaminated, because no other explanation comes to mind. Will likely get rid of the pitcher at this point and look for another product from another company. Too bad! What a waste..."
2,looks good but defective,"Brita has a good reputation and the pitcher looks great. But after you start using it for a while you see those blue carbon particles escaping the filter and entering your glass of water. I tried different things but it seems the defect is in how the pitcher is designed, because I had a less well know pitcher in the past and this never happened.I contacted customer service and the very polite lady explained to me that it is OK if a few of them come out, because they are made from ""coconut tree"" or something. Still, these are supposed to be the carbon particles that filter the water, ie suck all the things we do not want to drink, so I consider this explanation poor and I am sorry to say I had to throw away the pitcher and buy another brand..Brita 42558 Aqualux Water Pitcher"
3,Ok quality for the price,"The quality of the individual materials is good, but the lid comes out too easily when I am pouring water. I didn't expect this lack of assembly quality in a +$30 pitcher..."
3,The lid is sooooo irritating,"We bought the older model with manual timer two and a half years ago. We are happy with the taste and have no issue (yet) with the quality of the different parts. On the other hand, the lid has never ever stayed in its place. I had to hold the pitcher with one hand and the lid with the other. Not always practical so now, we take off the lid (well, sometimes hubby forgets and I know it when I hear him growling) but come on, we are not supposed to ""play"" with that. Also I don't like the black particles standing in the top tank.Hoped the new model's lid would have been fixed, I'm disappointed..."
5,Excellent filter,I am very happy with this Brita filter. The water here in my area is very hard and metal tasting. This filter takes away that pipey taste. It has a digital indicator to tell you when to replace the filter. Overall a great deal.
3,Water ok but pouring spout is a nuisance,"The Brita filter works fine. I am finding this a messy pouring spout. Also irritated at getting my arm all wet if, when I have finished filling it, I accidentally tip it towards myself. There is a hole near the top of the handle."
3,Works but takes time.,The water taste fine but I find myself filling it over and over and there is only myself and my dog. Guess I am to use to the water faucet filter but since I have a new faucet that type will no longer fit on it. When I need a new fridge I will toss this thing out and just use the filter water and ice cubes from the fridge but for now I am stuck with this.
5,Read The Instructions,"I have had this Aqualux Water Pitcher for a couple of months now, and the only way I could duplicate the problems other reviewers have written about was to do everything wrong. It works exactly as described if you read and follow the directions; soak the new filter then rinse it under running water; do not attempt to pour while the reservoir is still full; when filling the reservoir, do not allow the water to hit directly on the filter; etc. I use this pitcher all day long every day and have not had a single problem. The water tastes great, and my tea and coffee taste better than ever. Do not be put off by the negative reviews - this is a great little pitcher and a great value."
1,Poor Design,"I agree 100% with a fellow reviewer named A. Ferguson. This is my 2nd Brita pitcher that we own. We loved the 1st one so much. When we came across a newer model in 2007, we bought one from Costco. We thought we would enjoy it like the old one that we had used for more than 7 years. We were wrong. Everything that was described by A. Ferguson is happening to us. The lid always come off when we try to pour water. We never attempt to pour it when the water is in the reservoir but it still comes off. It is horrible. I sent an email to Brita's customer service about our experience but the reply did not answer our question and concern. it was just a generic reply that a P.R. would do. Totally annoying and irrelevant. We love the taste of Brita filtered water but will not buy another Brita product until they can resolve the design flaw. I do not recommend this particular product to anyone."
5,Brita Aqualux water pitcher,"This is a terrific product. The water tastes better than any bottled water I've ever found, using a Brita leaves a very small carbon footprint (a new filter every 3 months is required) and it saves money and resources. I think by using the Brita we have not used over 1,500 plastic bottles in the course of a year."
2,"Awkward, Difficult to Handle","This pitcher is very heavy and the weight tilts forward when full of water. The opening in the top for easy refill is more of a pain to use than taking the whole lid off as the whole side gets wet and it is too hard to hold with one hand. I had the ""Slim"" model prior and even though I had to fill it more often, I much preferred that model. This is so not worth the price."
3,Disappointing...,"I love Cage, however, this e.p. is a seriously weak effort from the guy that brought us the incredibly dope lps Nighthawks, Smut Peddlers, and Movies for the Blind. For one, with less Mighty Mi beats, the production suffers (even the perpetually brilliant RJD2 seems bored on this lp, giving Cage so-so fare) leaving Camu Tao to pick up the slack (with J-Zone and Cage still not quite working their kinks out of their chemistry and on the redudant ""Too Much RMX""). Also, with Haterama only one verse long and already being released, this dessert e.p. suffers tremendously, wading in mediocrity where Movies For the Blind stood out like blood red mars, shimmering hauntingly in the night sky."
3,DECENT,"If you liked Movies for the Blind chances are you'll be feeling this release as well. My only complaints are its very short, 2 of the 9 songs are remixes which I didnt like as much as the originals, and 1 song was previously released on The Conspiracy, (come to Daddy). Weather People is nice (rjd2 beat), and my personal favorite song is Leak Bros. feat Tame One, dope Reef beat and the flows are nice. Cage is definitley stepping it up lyrical wise, but this album just feels like it was thrown together w/out much effort. If your a fan of the self proclaimed prince of leak this probably won't dissapoint you, but keep in mind its really short."
5,Graceful,I was very pleased when I received this print it really added character to the wall I hung it on. I would recommend this poster for adding a little splash of color.
4,My review of Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work,I have not finished this book. From what I have read Maria Montessori had a unique calling and mission--to bring to the world the understanding that the years of childhood are indeed in many ways the most important years of a person's life.
1,Horrible Movie,"I actually rented this movie by mistake. I was trying to watch The Headunter""s"". Which is a very good movie. This thing, I only watched a few minutes and realized my mistake. The few minutes watched were just horrible."
1,not exactly what the title promises,"Instead of a handbook on language learning strategies, you might find that you have a primer on comparative linguistics. Here are some topics which are discussed:--Romance and Germanic word origins in the English language--differences in word order between languages--differences in letter-to-sound correspondence between languages--noun gender in European languagesIf any of this applies to the language which you are studying, it will all be explained in your language textbook anyway.I can say one thing in the author's favor: on pages 64-65, he stresses the importance of speaking aloud while studying. That is one bit of advice which one can follow without adding to the daily schedule.He promises that following this advice will help dramatically. I shall try it."
2,Breathtakingly obvious language learning advice,"Grahm Fuller likes languages and wants to share his enthusiasm for them. This, at least, he does well. However, the vast majority of his advice can be found elsewhere and with better presentation. If you're looking for a little motivation and a few tips for getting started on language learning, Fuller is fine. But if you're serious about language learning, you'd be better off with Barry Farber's How to Learn Any Language."
3,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this release for the following reasons: First, the cover art is not the same and its not as good as what is depicted. Second, some of the live tracks are different from those listed. ""Eat the rich"" and ""just cos you got the power"" are not on the Cd though they are listed as being on it. Instead, the disc has ""traitor"" and ""built for speed"". On the plus side its a pretty good collection of some of the more underrated Motorhead songs."
4,I was so so hooked on this book!!!!~ it's my kind of book!,Ilove the book. how did Bebe think of it? I read a lot and I've read good books but Class Trip& Class TripII(2)are at the top of my list!!!!
3,"Well, it was okay . . .","Class Trip was an alright book; the author is pretty talented, except it wasn't too hard or complex to follow, which usually forms the best kind of mystery. The killer was only mildly surprising, and so was how the killer would get caught. But it's still a fine read, so go ahead and check it out. :)"
5,"A ""must see"" for every Christian teen","Sex As God's Gift is an outstanding and superbly produced series of six 25-minute videos developed specifically for use in youth seminars for 14 and 15 year olds, in order to prepare them for the sexual decisions they face as young adults and as Christians. The six videos are titled Making Good Decisions, STDs and Pregnancy, The Reality of Teen Pregnancy, Sexuality is a Gift, Relationships, and Common Questions Teens Have. Mary Ronan, a registered nurse who has worked with teens for ten years, communicates her wisdom and experience to viewers and students. Also included are a 78-minute program for parents, Raising Your Children in an Ungodly World, and the companion book. In a world where the secular media constantly thrusts irresponsible sexual images upon people of all ages, Sex As God's Gift is a ""must see"" for every Christian teen."
4,Quite interesting... but that's it.,"As far as I know, this movie was incredibly influenced by ""Mission Impossible"" (the first one) with Tom Cruise. Well, I may say that this movie is kinda like that with more HK style action and humour. So it's quite exciting to watch after all.But as for an entertaining action ""blockbuster typr"" movie, this one's story was quite a little bit too complicated and too up-and-down. But who cares, when Takeshi Kaneshiro is in there?"
5,Richie's Picks: THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT: A PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY,I am a librarian who has utilized this photographic history for many years as a resource book with middle school students. The text is clear and concise; the photographs speak volumes.
5,"One of the best, relating to UFO abductions","I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and it is one of the best I've read, relating to UFO abductions/sightings. The events and the people involved are very complex. It will answer several questions and open up several more. Great reading, I hope there is a follow up soon!"
3,This book kept me up at night!,"This is the first Budd Hopkins Book I have read. As a UFO enthusiast, I recommend this as an essential to any collection.The conclusions drawn in this book are controversial and you may not agree with them all. This book includes references to actual documented events that are cross referenced with times of abductions."
2,Long-winded and shaky alien soap opera,"I expected more from the first true book I've read about this type of phenomena. The book should have been a third of its 398 pages, because in the end, all you have is a couple of people's stories, however compelling they are, to judge for their truthfulness. The three cental figures connected to the Linda Cortile case won't reveal themselves, so we're left wondering if she made them up(by sending letters to the author) to further her sensational means. There isn't any real evidence other than a xray that used to show an object in Mrs. Cortile's nose, which is no longer there, well, because the aliens took it out. Hopkins conviction and analysis is compelling, as well as some interesting side stories. But in the end, even if the events did take place, which is possible, what happened is kinda silly. With obsessed top security agents, a wierd ""world leader"", and criss-crossing generational alien meetings, this should have preferably been a 30 page article."
1,Best sci-fi novel I ever read!,"I really liked this book, it was the best sci-fi novel I ever read. I live in New York City, how anyone could think that an abduction could take place here and only like five people see it. One of the witnesses ""Janet Kimbel"" said that there were a lot of other people on the Brooklyn Bridge with her and that were ""running around screaming"" in horror, yet not one of these other people called the police or said anything to anybody ever. Believe me, New Yorkers are not known for keeping their mouths shut. But it is a fun read, I couldn't put it down!"
5,Brilliantly Written,"Witnessed is truly one of the most bizarre and intriguing stories I have ever read. The author writes about a group of seemingly unrelated people that have a secret life involving dreams, UFO's, and aliens. The characters become aware of their relationship in a most bizarre and unexpected way suggesting a conspiracy of mind boggling proportions. The author then backs up the first bizarre account with numerous others reinforcing the suggestion that something unbelievable is going on in the world. The book does not offer any answers to the UFO puzzle and poses many more questions than it answers. The book reveals a tangent to the UFO phenomenon that has not been revealed before. Well researched and written, Witnessed is probably the most significant work on aliens and UFO's since Communion or Missing Time."
5,Great music,This CD is wonderful and takes me back to my teenage years. I would recommend this CD to anyone who remembers Bobby Goldsboro.
4,International mix,"I really enjoyed the video. It kinda made me look at my marriage in a different light. I am an American and I too am married to a man from Africa. Some cultural traditions that were brought up I am dealing with. Overall it was a good movie and I enjoyed it. Of course, some things are not true in every relationship but we all have those days and situations."
1,"Not Epson, not as advertised.","Not as advertised. This is NOT a genuine Epson T020201 cartridge for $6.95, it is a compatible cartridge from another manufacturer, 4Inkjets. Had to have a long argument with their customer service rep to convince them to refund the shipping charges as well as the product price since what they shipped was not what I ordered.A giant headache and total waste of my time."
1,Epson Colored ink cartridge,"This product (color Epson ink cartridges) arrived on time. I installed one of them. It is not producing print except for a few blurry smears. This is frustrating, as I cannot use my printer. I have not had time yet to make calls to Epson tech to assess the problem. Can I return the product and get a refund if it is defective?Obviously, I should not rate the item, except that the reporting system requires it, so I hit one star."
3,Anticipating Surprise,"Good read. Thought provoking. Timeless in the context of thinking about ""warning"" as a discipline, a process, an outcome, and as an intellectual activity."
4,nice hoop,"Not difficult to put together, I did it alone.Filling the base with sand is a pain, the holes are too small.I should've bought the larger backboard.A good hoop for the price"
5,Just what we wanted!,"This basketball hoop is nice looking, sturdy and perfect for home use. Someone else set it up for me and said it wasn't that complicated but it did take some time and work. I did take notes from the other reviewers and passed them on to the person who put it together. It arrived in perfect condition, with all the parts, and arrived on time. Overall, we are very pleased."
5,The other comments are accurate,"This is a very nice basketball system....and the instructions are a challenge. But, the bottom line is this is very much worth the money and the time to put it together,"
4,"Yeah, the instructions stink, but.....","I think this unit is sharp looking and worth the money. If you buy this, you might need to go forward a couple of steps while assembling, (ie if you are on step 19 look at step 23) to make sure you are going in the right direction. Some parts are mislabled, as another reviewer stated. I ended up with a bunch of extra parts, but everything works so I'm happy."
4,Inexpensive and does the job but prone to rust,"Unlike some others on here, I had no problems with the installation which took me 2 hours. The instructions recommend 2 adults to assemble, but I has no problem assembling it by myself. You do need a small table or stool to put under the goal area while you assemble the back of the backboard.My only complaint is that the goal has been up for only one week and it's already starting to rust! The hoop section has several very rusty areas and the pole is rusting where some of the paint was scraped during shipping and assembly. At this rate, I expect the hoop section may rust out in a few years."
4,Good product but convoluted directions,"Make sure you allot plenty of time to build this. I have always been considered adept at building things. While this is a good, sturdy product the directions leave much to be desired. Instead of explicitly written directions, this comes with difficult diagrams. Much time was wasted just trying to figure out the confusing pictures. Fortunately I correctly assembled it and now my son is having a blast. As others have said, it is a MUST that you have at least two people to assemble this. Overall, it's a very good product but Lifetime MUST make the directions more clear. Had that been the case I would have assembled this in half the time."
2,Horrible Instructions,"While this is a nice piece of equipment once it's assembled, the instructions for assembly are HORRIBLE! It took 3 intelligent men and 1 intelligent woman over 7 hours of putting parts together, taking them apart and re-assembling, and trying to figure out the illustrations included with the instructions. I won't buy this brand again if I have another choice.Sarah"
2,Buyer Beware,"The instruction manual is VERY poorly written, so much so that I cannot recommend this unit to anyone. The unit took 6 hours to construct, and we are still not sure if it is put together properly. Even the pictures in instructions contradict themselves. The biggest problem is the height adjustment (as mentioned in several other previous reviews). If the manufacturer put forth even 1 hour of research before releasing this product by watching a consumer put this until together, they could have produced half-way decent instructions that are actually usable. Frustrating best describes this product."
5,Lifetime 1482 Height-Adjustable Portable Basketball System with 50-Inch Backboard,"I ordered this yesterday at about 3:00 pm or so and recieved it by 11:15 am today. I'm impressed. And spent 100 dollars less than buying it downtown, plus gas and my time to do it. Thanks Guys. Now all I have to do is put it together before Christmas..."
3,Assembly Advice,I just purchased the portable basketball system and after reading the various reviews I'm afraid to put the basketball system together. Can anyone tell me where I might be able to find someone to assembly this for me? I'm willing to pay.
5,A must read!,"The Shadows of Babylon has realistic characters living in frighteningly realistic settings. Is the government taking over the personal lives of the characters? Is this set in the future or is it happening today? The action is non-stop and holds the reader until the end. If you like Frank Peretti's writing or the Left Behind series, you will certainly enjoy The Shadows of Babylon."
4,"Fun, Cool and Takes You Back ... Way Back","While these aren't as great as those collected on THE SOUND GALLERY collection, they are just a slight notch below. After you get those CD's, you will want these. These are the funky, brassy, & loud backing tracks of a soundtrack to a life of ""manly"" adventure - you are that guy instantly transport to a chase on a moving freighter, a race for your life across Paris rooftops or a mano fist fight in some back alley of Rome.All cool. All fun and all great."
2,Its ok...,The movie was funny at times but I really did not think it was that good of a movie.. I like Diane Keaton thats the reason why I wanted to see this move..She was great in it but that pretty much it...
4,Bright and Funny,"This film is a hoot. I can only describe it as a less intellectual, brighter form of a Woody Allen film. It's got beautiful shots of New York, it's got the neurotic ""uptown"" socialites, it's got the midlife crises situations (a re-curring theme in Allen's films), and it's got careless laugh out loud sight gags. A must see...a perfect ""sunday afternoon movie."""
2,Why not give it a glance on the positive side?,"Wow... look at all the big names out there: Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Gary Shandling, Andie McDowell, Nastassja Kinsky, Charlton Heston, Jenna Elfman, Josh Harnett... They somehow reminded me of another star-studded movie, ""Everyone says I love you"" (featuring Woody Allen, Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda, Julia Roberts, Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Natasha Lyonne, Natalie Portman...) which remains one of the best comedies ever. My point is, don't blame it on the actors. They could be at their best or at their worst (and they all got bills to pay don't they?) That being said, I believe poor movies like ""Town & Country"" are worth being made, just to render fairness and more value to good movies like ""Everyone says I love you""."
1,Wish I could rate it No Stars.,"Believe the rest of the reviewers when they say that this possibly may be the worst movie ever made. My review is only based on watching 1/2 of the movie because after the scene where Charlton Heston starts bellowing like a dragon, I had to turn it off or be sick to my stomach. My feeling is that movie is just too young for the actors playing the lead roles. Warren Beatty is in his 60's - yes I know that men get better as they get older, but seeing yet another movie where the husbands start to have mid life crises and start having affairs and the women are clueless is just passe at this point. These are roles that these actors can play with their eyes closed. They certainly have proven time and time again that they are talented - why did they waste their time on this drivel?"
2,what went wrong,All these actors and all the pretty places they live and the marvelous houses and clothes and cars and interesting careers yet the movie is empty. Maybe you expect more from people when they get past the age of fifty. It could have been fun and flirty and silly without losing all sense of proportion. I wanted to like these people and to care but when Wareen Beatty and Goldi Hawn show up wearing the same clothes they wore thirty years ago and playing the same character they've played before you begin to feel sorry for them. Give me something new besides all the pretty things. What a fun romp this could have been.
3,Having it all to having to start from stratch,"This movie is perfect for the perfect couple. When you figure out that your marrige of 25 years is on the rocks what do you do? Well Ellie nows what to do, try to resolve it. After embarrissing her in front of everyone and everyone knows about his cheating. So they finally get a divorce when Potter finally realizes let he had lost his only true love. So know he has to work on getting it back one step at a time."
3,Hidden Feature,"1 hidden feature on this dvdPush up until the high-light bar is gone, then push enter."
3,FUNNY,"Even though this wasnt a great movie, it was extremely funny. I would rate this movie a 10 by any means but for a good laugh i would highly recommend it."
2,"A Real Turkey, Considering the Cast","I understand completely why this movie sat on the shelf since 1998. It should have stayed there. I haven't seen a movie this poorly directed and unfunny since Breakfast of Champions. The story revolves around Warren Beatty's character, Porter Stoddard, a chronic adulterer married to Diane Keaton. Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling play their friends also going thru marital problems of their own.The actors were wasted in the movie and should have known better."
1,RE: Waste of Time.,"Unfortunately Town & Country was a total waste of time and good talent. Everything about this movie was painfully bad, from the writing to the directing to the uninspired acting of a tremendously talented cast. The movie just never took off and lacked any spark of intelligence or energy. Do not waste your time or money."
1,town & country,Worst film with so many stars that I have seen for quite some time. So many scenes were so pitiful. Nothing funny about this movie. All of the characters were pathetic.
5,Tae-Bo is the best!,"I have over 70 workout tapes, and I think Tae-bo is the most fun, motivating, and effective. You can really feel your abs working, and getting trimmer. And, you don't have to do all those boring crunches on the floor.I would buy my Tae-bo tapes at QVC.com though. They have a set of six Get Ripped tapes with these two advanced tapes, plus the two basic, an intro to impact, and a 8 minute workout, all for only (price). (It's {price} here for only the four.) Plus, they have the newest Tae-bo tapes, Tae-bo Total, that you can only get on QVC. It's a set of eight tapes, four basic and four advanced, for only (price). I have that set too, and it's just as good as all his other sets. QVC.com just has better prices!!!! (I don't work for them or anything, I just look for great deals!)"
5,Tae Bo II: Not for sissies!!!!,"This is the best Tae Bo yet. But a word of caution for beginners. These tapes are just what the say: ADVANCED! I started doing the first series of tapes about 2 months ago and the first time I did the Tae Bo II tapes (last week), it kicked my [rear]. This isn't for the beginner. Start with the first series and work your way up to this set. This is an awesome workout and somthing to work your way up to. Trust me, you will be glad you did."
5,Excellent workout,"I started doing Tae-Bo when the tapes first came out and I've been doing kickboxing for years-- this is definately the most intense workout I've done so far. I've ordered so many other tapes only to find that they moved way too slow and were completely useless. You do have to know your own limits with these tapes though because the tempo can be very fast at times. The music isn't the best, but this is an excellent workout and the time goes by so fast. Larry Lam's XKO is also an excellent workout, but not quite as challenging as this one."
4,A nice alternative,"I have always stayed away from any type of aerobic tapes since I found they never really seem to get the heart rate going much. I run, lift weights and do the elliptical machine at a high intensity. According to the Billy Blanks Tae Bo video reviews, I thought I'd try this exercise video for a cardio alternative. Well I have to say, I did sweat a bit on these videos and found the time went by very quickly.The balancing was more challenging than I expected. I just wish there was a bit more fast paced cardio involved to have my heart rate high the entire time."
4,Great workout,These are good if you are tired of your previous tae bo videos. Definitely gives you a workout and breaks the monotony.
4,"Great workout, but still needs some additional help","I was really looking forward to getting this DVD in the mail and continuing on my TaeBo workout. I have the original VHS TaeBo tapes, but they always left me wanting a longer workout. I wrongly assumed that these DVDs would have longer workouts (at least 35 mins of intense cardio). Instead the workouts average 25 mins total. The one saving grace is the 8 minute power workout. I now skip the cool down stage of the main workout and forward straight to the 8 min workout (which actually runs about 12 mins!). Then I either go back to the cool down or just do my own. As for the workouts themselves, I think they are vastly improved over the first series, and it's nice to have 2 different workouts to choose from, with some new moves. The sounds still needs some work. When you pay big bucks for a DVD, you expect quality sound, and this just isn't up to par. Billy gets washed out sometimes. The music is a little tinny too."
1,Will End Up at Your Next Yard Sale,"Pass this one up. This will be one that ends up sitting on a shelf forever, then sold at your next yard sale. This workout will beat you up, and leave you tired."
3,Tae-Bo II Review,"Of the two tapes, I think the 1st of the the two is a better tape. Both workout tapes are quite similar though. Very energetic, and a fairly tough workout"
5,BEST WORKOUT EVER!!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST WORKOUT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I'M THE KIND OF PERSON WHO GETS BORED WITH EASY STUFF, SO THIS VIDEO WAS A CHALLENGE FOR ME. I USE IT IN COMBINATION WITH FAT BLASTER WORKOUT, ULTIMATE BOOTCAMP, AND AB BOOTCAMP. IT'S AWESOME. GOD BLESS BILLY BLANKS FOR MAKING THESE WORKOUTS!!!!"
5,Best DVD workout,"The champagne of workouts...the best out there..I like the fact that the students look REAL..There are a few senior citizens,a few full figured gals,some 40-ish ladies,and some regular guys mixed in with the gym gods and godesses showing that Tae-Bo is good for all..The workout is for your entire body and the music is great..I would reccomend everyone get this DVD if you have to own something..."
2,Tae Bo with ADD,"I do not like these workouts. I have the original Tae bo workouts, and find them much easier to follow along to. In Tae Bo II Blanks moves so quickly and doesn't spend enough time on each move. It is like watching a person with ADD do a workout. There are also so many people as back up people that it's hard to follow. Too many faces cause much more confusion. If you're new to Tae Bo I highly recommend the originals."
4,Good Workout and Good Deal,"I bought this video because I was too ""thrifty"", OK, cheap to purchase the DVD version of the original Tae-Bo workout set, which I liked in the past. If you've never Tae-Bo'd before, you'll appreciate that you get instructional with this video. If you have, no real surprises here. The basic workout wasn't quite enough for me, but add the 8 minute at the end and you'll feel the burn. I am still partial to the original versions but for the price, this is a pretty good deal."
4,Book review,"""Your Way With God's Word"" is the perfect read for anyone, lay or professional, who intends to preach or who preaches. The book asks the reader thought-provoking questions regarding the reader's journey to the place of desiring to preach or of preaching. All of these questions, answered in written exercises, paint a picture of the new or seasonsed preacher. This picture helps the preacher to understand who he/she is and what he/she brings to the art of preaching God's word.Along with the questions, are homiletical meditations which bring many more remarkable insights to the preacher. This read requires the reader to allow breaktime (including rest, recreation, and prayer space) between each chapter. Each chapter prepares the reader for the defining questions that lead the reader to find his/her personal preaching voice. The reader's preaching voice will, after reading this book, be fully authentic and resonate full knowledge of the art of preaching."
4,One to read and think about.,"I liked this book from the standpoint that it caused me to think about things. Not being a biblical scholar or theologian, I tried to relate as a human with some reasonable religious training (albeit one dimensional). The book was readable and thought provoking. It prompted me to analyze things and satisfy myself as to the significance of God in my life. Can you ask much more of a book?"
4,Well worth reading.,"Great book but one statement doesn't check out.Pg 97 the author says Moses father not named in Bible.Should check out Exodus 6 v 20. Moe's fathers name is Amram.I found it, how come?"
5,Must read if you'd like to know what makes God tick...,"Great explanation for how God, if he/her was a charachter in a book, might play out. Read this and get a good view of HIStory!"
5,Sloppy reading,"Two reviewers demonstrate poor reading habits. With reference to the name of Moses' father, the author on p.97 does NOT say that the name is absent from the Bible. In fact Miles notes its appearance in Exodus 6:20. The whole point is the reference to the father at this crucial point in the narrative deliberately without name and as ""a certain man of the house of Levi"" and what this implies.The book is a beautiful demonstration of close reading."
4,"Pretty good condition, wait not so good","The book took longer than I would have liked to get to me. It had some folded edges and looks aged, but it was in good condition otherwise. It was practically new besides those two things. Like a book you get from the library in good condition."
1,"Well Intentioned, perhaps","The premise of the book is quite interesting - look at the Bible as a piece of literature and evaluate the ""characters"" as if you were reviewing Shakespeare. Unfortunately, it's horribly dry and reads like a Doctoral thesis. Intrigued by the topic, I continued the endeavor, truly wishing to enjoy it. By page 86, I could no longer tolerate the verbose, pretentious writing style and abandoned the book on the subway."
2,Uninteresting,I'm not entirely sure why this book has received such aclaim. Miles's commentary is uninteresting and he doesn't contribute any profound insights. His interesting points are few and far between and he manages to say very little about each topic he covers. I applaud him in his effort -- the idea behind the book is a good one. Miles is just unable to really pull it off.
2,Who is God?,Scholarly written from an unique perspective yet not convincing. Heavy sledding with little satisfaction.
3,I did not like it.,I must apologize because I did not truly read this book so I gave ita 5. I suppose if I had read it I would have given it a 1. I sawan interview with the author and I was disturbed by what I heard.I am a Christian who believes in the sovereignty of the Lord GodAlmighty. It is not possible to know and understand God withoutfirst acknowledging Him as the Creator and Sustainer of life. Anyattempt to do otherwise would be neglecting God of His due praiseand adoration. I pray that the Lord will open Jack Miles' heart andshow him what he missed when he wrote this book.
1,Unworthy of serious consideration.,"Jack Miles' god comes across as nothing more than a young, impetuous wizard, coming of age in a world he does not control. Indeed, his god is little more than a glorified, often malicious, and always unpredictable Harry Potter. It is unfortunate that one who has such admirable educational qualifications should write such utter nonsense. Miles ignores centuries of biblical scholarship and tradition. This book is poorly conceived and poorly written."
1,disappointed with a fake!,"I ordered the watch last week and received it today. It was a fake. It was not authentic as it is described and none of the company information and authenticity card was provided. Instead, there was a cardboard that covered the leather case and said Made in China. Steinhausen is a German company. Also, the sapphire that is supposed to be in the crown is missing! Very disappointed. Amazon should've stated it is not authentic. One of the photos even has the authenticity cards in the listing. Very upset1"
3,Wanted: A thin watch,"I ordered this watch from Amazon because it was advertised as being the thinnest watch and Amazon had by far the best prices and service.So far it keeps excellent time, which is the most important factor. It looks and feels great on my wrist.For my use, however, the date is too small for me to see, the night vision of the time is non-existant and the band is fraying after only a few weeks wear.I plan to purchase a new band for it and will have to live with not being able to see the date or the time during the night."
4,Thin watch?,"I bought the silver version of this watch as I have quite a few watches (I'm addicted to watches). So, rather than spend the extra cash on the gold version, I decided to try the stainless steel item.It comes magnificently packaged and is very attractive and worth the money, but it is a misnomer to say it is the world's thinnest watch. I have a watch specially made for Sachs Fifth Avenue, bought in 1984 for a mere pittance that is as thin as the Steinhausen watch. It, also, has a Swiss quartz movement with a date display at three o'clock, plus it has a sweep second hand that I like.The Steinhausen watch has a true thickness of about 6.5mm, which is much less than some of the behemoth's I own, but certainly isn't the world's thinnest. Nonetheless, I am a fan of this watch--the workmanship is far superior to most, and it is truly a beautiful watch."
4,My New Watch,PRO:Love the fact that the watch is very thin which was the main reason for the purchase.It's a very handsome watchCON:The date feature is useless since it is too small to read. If I had it to do over I would have purchased a watch without the date feature.There is no second hand.
1,awful,This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I plan on burning it next time I go camping. SERIOUSLY.
4,"Powerful story, great Indie thriller!","I saw this at a local film festival in Orlando a while back. I think about a year ago.Beautifully photographed, well made and a great concept. The concept of twins in horror films has been used many times before, but not this way, no way. I do remember thinking a lot about this flick days after I saw it. It might not have had the huge budget of studio films, but the smart filmmaking and story telling is there.I thought the main ""Bad"" guy in the film did an amazing job, as he not only is struggling with a great deal of guilt, but also suffering from a horrendous medical problem. Its quite original actually, but I won't reveal more, you've got to see it.Cool to see this film available to the public."
4,"Beautifully shot, younger twins steal the show",Beautifully crafted independent thriller. Looks and feels like a Hollywood picture. The story is interesting with the main character suffering from a true affliction I didn't know about. The younger twins (who is played by one actress) and the redneck father steal the show though in my opinion. Their scenes together are outstanding. A well shot piece out of Florida. Not many independent films end up looking this good.
3,A twin and her ghost.,"White trash twins grow up and one is murdered the living one is haunted by the ghost of her dead twin and can not rest until she finds the one who killed her sis.Good story and good acting make this worth a look. Keep in mind this looks like it was made for the Lifetime network but has a few curse words thrown in. The wimpy killer (Greg Thompson) begged for a bullet in the head and just really ticked me of as did the whisky tango (W.T. white trash) father of the twins, boy was he a worthless waste of air.I really think the young lady who plays the twins Juliet Reeves, is good in this and I hope to see her again. If you can take the made for video type of movies then this one is worth a look."
4,Brubeck on Broadway,"The Deeper I go into the Brubeck catalog, the happier I get. If you have a copy of Time Out, and want to go a little further, this is a great place to start.The joyful, brilliant rendition of ""Maria"" justifies twice the cost of this record all by itself. It is not all that often that a timeless classic is actually improved upon. This material might as well have been written for Paul Desmond.Almost 50 years after its release, this music remains sophisticated, edgy and elegant. Highly Recommended."
2,This is not a Brubeck Masterpiece!,The West Side Story songs are limited to four selections and the quartet does not delve deeply into any of them. I have almost all of the Brubeck albums recorded over Brubeck's career. The quartet usually stretches out with excellent improvisations but not the case here. There are no liner notes and the members of the quartet are not even listed.The listing of the 9 tunes on the album are not even in correct sequence but quite helter-skelter.This is an insult to the memory of the class act that was the Dave Brubeck Quartet.
2,Answer: NO!,"They cut out about 7 episodes from the Namek saga! Shame, shame! Dragon Ball Z is awesome! How could they censor all of this? These are the videos, not the TV series. They could have taken the time to release the uncut versions of this awesome series with an addictive plot. tsk, tsk...if you can get past the censoring (it is very easy to tell) and the incredibly corny dialogue, then enjoy."
5,Namek Saga,"This Saga starts out with vegeta falling from goku's last blast. Goku stops krillin from killing vegeta and vegeta swears to come back and destroy earth. Goku is in the hospital and Gohan, Krillin, and Bluma decide to find the dragon balls on Namek. After having alittle bit of trouble in space they finally end up on namek. There they find freeza and his gang torturing the nameks and are on the same quest to find the dragon balls. Goku finally heels and is able to join them on there quest. Vegeta also is heeled and finds out that freeza is also after the dragon balls to he rushes to namek too. Now krillin, bulma, and Gohan have to deal with freeza, and vegeta. Goku hurry up and get your butt to namek as soon as possible. This box set is only in english. A great item. A must have for all DBZ fans."
3,The Namek Saga is a BUST!,"Unlike the Saiyan Conflict, I don't like this saga. Its 28 episodes of fluff. Just waiting around for Goku. This saga I do reccomend to pick up the new pioneer version."
5,It's Dragonball Z! It's got to be good!,"Although I don't approve of Funimation editing Dragonball Z, YOU WOULDN""T BE ABLE TO SEE DRAGONBALL Z IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM! MUCH LESS HEAR ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! It's edited, but it's Dragonball Z, so it's good!"
5,DBZ RULES! BUY THEM ALL!,"This is the absolute best series I've ever seen! There are awsome fights, a good storyline, and sometimes funny dialog. The only problem with these are waiting for the new ones to come out!"
5,"ALLY TO GOOD, NIGHTMARE TO YOU!","If you like good animation, good voice acting and a wide variety of characters, this is the movie set for you. It may even shed a tear in your eye. When Goku changes into a different being, it made me go back into my library of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z movies before it to admire what kind of person Goku was. Freiza better power up to 100% of his power Quickly!"
5,all dragonball z sagas....,...my faveret show is dragonball z itsamazing i like all the sagas. June 25th 2002 I am from the ukmy dragonball z sain conflict saga should be comming soon.all the sagas are cool and amazon.com hase the best prises.If you are geting dragonball z on vhs get the uncut version.Becuse on cartoon network dragonball z is edited.also get dragonball z coolers revenge its awsome.it hase musik by deathtons and disterbed and way more.dragonball z is awasom !!...
3,"Good, but not as good as the originals","First of all, I'm sure if you've heard reviews like these saying how much better the Japanese versions of DBZ are. No, these aren't as good the Japanese version, but its better than nothing. I can understand if people want to get these because the sub-titles can be quite difficult to come by. Anyway, I gave it three stars because I couldn't give it a zero, because the stories there and because there aren't quite as many edits, but there are still a lot of things missing(Even whole episodes!). Can you believe they actually say die!! Wow, that's just terrible, after hearing that I found out that when someone gets shot through the chest with an energy beam, they don't go to ""Another dimension"", they(get this)die. What a concept."
3,A great backgroud setting for the Freiza battle.,"This saga is really, really slow for the most part. But it is a great set-up for the next box set, which is the battle with the rest of the Ginyu and Freaiza. Alot of plot development went in this Saga."
2,"It was brought into the US , but . . .","I cannot blame the people who wrote and censored the ""americanized"" dragon ball z , episodes for making it a cheasy Pokemon esque type of anime . Funimation , atleast tried to make this show hit in the US . If it weren't the effort of Funimation to even bring Dragon Ball Z into an ""American-children-audiance"" genre I would give this a -1 star if they had it . As you can see by the ""real"" fans that this was way censored , I mean theres so many goofy lines that its sad . Take for example on one of the episodes , like when the news chopter was blasted by Napa , Teinshin yelled out , ""wait they are ok , I see them with parashutes!"" when you can clearly see the chopter is burnt to bits . Well if you are an anime fan and want to see why Dragon Ball Z is great , then I would recomend you to try and find an uncut version of Dragon Ball Z. By saying Uncut I mean its realistic , better in story , and plain out good ."
5,I only wish there was more,"I was very pleased with what I saw. True, they are edited and some things are cut out. But they give you the story and its something that my whole family can watch together. The only regret that I have is that I can't get all of the episodes in this good of quality. There are actually 531 episodes total. 176 are just Dragon Ball, They are before DBZ. Then there are 291 episodes of DBZ. These are my personal favorites. Then, the last are the Dragon Ball GT episodes. I didn't really like these ones, but they are good none the less. I just wish somebody (Funimation) would make all of them available in English. I have them all but some are in japanese with subtitles which makes it hard to enjoy the episode, and some are just dubbed in English. I'm sure any true dbz fan would give an arm and a leg to have them all in English. I know i would. Hopefully this will inspire more people to try to get Funimation pumping out those episodes, it would definately be worth their time."
5,DBZ volume 2,Dragon Ball Z is probably the most popular anime. This set comes with all the Frieza episodes. Although this saga is not my favorite in the DBZ series it is pretty close. Frieza is one of the best villains ever in the show. Although in this season the voice acting kept getting weirder and weirder it is still a great saga. Also the art and animation in this saga isn't the best either.
1,Horrible Junk,"Please, this dubbed anime is even worse than Sailor Moon in English. It's been mangled to the core. Editing to the extreme, skipping about 16 episodes, changing the attacks. It's seriously the worst dub I've seen...(And that Rock the Dragon Music Video is the pits of 1995!)"
1,DBZ Hacked to death!,First off when I first saw DBZ in the middle of the saiyan saga I thought it as nothing more then a sailor moon type cartoon. Yet that is far from the case DBZ is one of the best show ever but this has been hacked away at too much. Its sad really and I think if you really want the full story and action that DBZ can give then buy the manga.
4,THE NAMEK SAGA,OUT OF ALL OF THE BOXED SETS THIS ONE IS THE BEST. THE HUNT FOR THE DRAGON BALLS IS ON. IN THIS SAGA VEGETA AND THE Z FIGHTERS TEAM UP! YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS SAGA. IT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
1,Not like they used to be.,"CHI does not have the same quality as before. These brushes break down after one use. CHI has outsourced their factories to China and it shows in the quality. I kid you not. I bought these brushes for my roommate, who's a hairdresser, and they break down after one use. She has been using CHI brushes for years, and she said they used to say ""made in the USA"" on the brushes. Now they have the ""made in China"" tag on them. She would not buy these brushes again and asked me to write reviews to warn buyers. Please beware before buying. If you've had good experiences with CHI in the past, they are not the same now."
1,Very Low Quality Now.,"CHI does not have the same quality as before. These brushes break down after one use. CHI has outsourced their factories to China and it shows in the quality. I kid you not. I bought these brushes for my roommate, who's a hairdresser, and they break down after one use.

She would not buy these brushes again and asked me to write reviews to warn buyers. Please beware before buying. If you've had good experiences with CHI in the past, they are not the same now."
1,Poor quality,"This is NOT a Boar bristle brush as it is described...instead, they appear to be plastic. Also, REAL boar bristles would not melt after one use. Would not recommend!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I should have heeded the warning of another reviewer. The tips of bristles melt from the blow dryer -- happened from the very first use. My daughter had bought one of these brushes, but the bristles on that one were metal, and these are plastic."
4,Great product!,"I'm a graphic designer who does a lot of presentations and color proofs. This printer is amazing: is fast, reliable and the color matching with the screen is perfect (!). I would have given a 5* rating if it came with an ethernet interfase and had a hardware postcript option.Great buy ! Make sure to get the special paper, the matte one is quite good (hq)"
1,Might be a defect but be warned...,I purchased this computer in July of 2001. It has performed okay. There are almost always black streaks down the center of the back of what you are printing which is a real problem when you are printing something double sided. I have tried everything and I thought the problem was fixed but it is not and now I am out of warranty. Probably cheaper to buy something new than figure out this lemon.
3,A Bit Dated,"Much of the information in this book is excellent but a lot of the technical infomation is dated. The projects anre interesting but some of the directions are not clear enough for novices. More color pictures, pictures of any type or color, are neededddr"
5,good for learning the basics,excellent and easy to understand. this book is well written and really helps with learning basic fusing/slumping techniques.
4,good investment for the beginner,I found this book very interesting. I'm new to glass fusing and although it goes into more of the larger type pieces. I found the information quite useful. It contains patterns and step by step instructions on how to do each piece.The only drawback I found is that most of the photos are in black and white.
1,Old book,"I found this book very old. Mostly the book is black and white. The information inside refers mostly to how to use a kiln and how to fire, examples are not nice (old style) to my opinion. The price is high to what it is."
3,arthurs perfect christmas,"My special needs grand daughter took a little extra time and found she had the dvd so never reviewed it. In the mean time the return window expired for a full refund and exchange. So, I am not reviewing the movies but I think around the holidays there should be extra time for a child to review their gifts. I will send the movies back. arthurs perfect christmas and good sport."
5,Great for Arthur fans,"We bought this for our nieces. We are Marc Brown fans and have enjoyed Arthur for years. My children have enjoyed this DVD since it was released, the main characters celebrate the holiday season in their own unique ways. The program includes different religions and traditions."
2,May be a disappointment for Arthur fans,"Our family loves watching Arthur on PBS and reading Marc Brown's Arthur books. Arthur's Perfect Christmas, however, was a disappointment. The show is very ambitious as it touched on Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Christmas and even, St. Lucia Day. I think it focused so much on the being all inclusive that it didn't do enough to explore the positive, non-commercial aspects of Christmas. Instead, the secular way of celebrating Christmas is explored with one character's family (Buster's)deciding not to celebrate the Christmas holiday at all because they find it ""too exhausting."" (Nice solution.) Arthur frets over his shopping list. D.W. pines away for the year's hot toy while everyone else in Elwood City seems to be celebrating alternative holidays.I think that Christmas was not portrayed in a very positive light in this video. The end result was that Arthur's Perfect Christmas didn't feel very Christmas-y. Maybe Arthur is getting a little too P.C. for me . . . ."
4,"Good, not Arthur's best...","I'm a fourteen year old guy and I still love this show as does my older brother who is nineteen. The jokes in the tv episodes go way over some kids heads and even over some adult's and when you catch them you wanna pee your pants. In this movie its less of the adult jokes, more random funny stuff. You have to love the way that in this movie (and alot of the episodes) they have a great way of ripping on toys/movies/books...Its awesome. With how cheap you can get this I would have to say...Watch the show first then go for it."
1,poor,This was terrible I never even received this item I only forgot about it because of the holidays. I was so busy I only remembered when my children had asked to watch it on pbs
2,Didn't get into it,My kids are young (under the age of 4) and couldn't get into this. Plus I don't enjoy movies about Christmas when they're really about being politically correct.
5,Can't Watch it Enough,"This movie is excellent! I'm older and have watched it 15 times. You learn about Kwanza, Hanukah, and Christmas. At first Arthur thinks he will have a Christmas with everything going his way. Then win his mothers present brakes he's heart broken. Everything then works out, it wasn't the way he thought but it was great. Each character has a side story like when Muffy and Francine get into an argument. This movie is great and I hope you share it with your kids."
5,One of or my favorite Christmas movie!,"I've grown up watching the show Arthur and have always loved the show. And I have always loved this Christmas movie. I searched and searched last year for this DVD but couldn't find a good deal on it. I am so happy they finally put it on DVD! I'm 22 years old and I STILL love watching this movie every Christmas. If you grew up watching Arthur, you'll like Arthur's Perfect Christmas :)"
3,Fine multi-cultural Christmas movie,I rented this movie for my kids this weekend while we were laid up with fevers. It was just okay... I found it was educational regarding other cultural and religious celebrations surrounding Christmas-time. But I'm annoyed by whining. Arthur's little sister is bossy and whiny and speaks in an ugly tone - not how I want my children to talk to each other OR to me. This is why I rated it low.
5,A Holiday Tradition,Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a great movie that my little sister and I started watching when we where 10 and 12 and now we are 22 and 24 we still watch it every Christmas morning right when we get up! Its a great movie and its fun to watch!
5,Professional flooring installer,"I've been installing floors for 35 years and have used these for about that long. I have tried to replace them with all of the new fangled pads that have come and gone but have always come back to these. These knee pads have helped prevent me from getting any kind of knee injury in all those years. Without them I can't stay kneeled on the floor for more than a hour but with them I can last all day, day after day. Well made, thick comfortable pad. My only wish is that they lasted longer but at this price it is a deal. Wide, durable, adjustable and comfortable elastic strap that will last as long as the pad. I even use the straps as a kind of bungee after the pad is gone. Don't confuse these with the foam pads or the ones with the thinner cheaper straps."
2,Kneepads have changed?,"I have been using this brand for 20 years. Easiest to get on & off quickly and have always held up well. Recent purchase was different.05/2012. The rubber rubbed off on everything it touched, turning things orange. Called company and they said to return them, that they were unaware of any problems. Don't know if this is short-term or long term problem, but be prepared to pay return shipping."
4,speaking skills,"I am really enjoying this software. As mentioned in another's review, it does assume that you have a decent background in Spanish. Someone looking for real beginners level work will be very frustrated with this prgram.I have a good level of reading comprehension, but am very shy with speaking. The voice recognition software gives good feedback and contains a decent amount of practice ""conversation"" (which is helping me to relax and think a little faster.) I am really getting a lot out of it and would definitely suggest it to others."
1,should have read the negative reviews,"Within an hour of using this program I was going to the amazon site to see if I could return it. This program is either way too easy ( say this letter, say this word etc.) or way too hard ( listen to someone talk in spanish for a few minutes and then answer questions about it) and doesn't have a lot of material to cover. I took spanish for a couple of years in high school and was looking for something to increase my speaking skills and vocabulary. This isn't it. Even if it was half the price it still wouldn't be worth my money or my time."
1,Not Mac compatible,"Not Mac compatible. I figured by now everything was, but not so. My own fault, but it would be nice if it was Mac compatible."
1,Talk to me in Spanish,Unable to use in home computer-very disappointed as I bought this for a Christmas Gift.
5,Dreader than dread,"This is one of those few albums that I can listen to all the way through. Every track is a classic dub. Some nice FarI tracks as well.To me, the stand-outs here are ""Reality Dub"" and of course, Ogun Dub, where FarI lets the sheep do the talking!If for nothing else, buy this CD for Sly's version of ""Sessame Street""!!!"
1,Don't be fooled.,DnB fans beware. this is not DJ HYPE it's some worthless imposter. I don't know who he is or where he came from but he needs to change his name because he's got some wack hip hop with crappy scratching all over it. It's not even mixed. I feel like a complete fool for buying it.
3,lasted 2 1/2 years,"Good for a ""banger"" watch. I bought this watch in 2007 and it died about two and a half years later. I thought the watch only needed a new battery, but discovered that the battery was okay. The second hand somehow got stuck. A couple of attempts to repair it failed, and for the cheap price, it wasn't worth further effort. You get what you pay for. The watch was good looking and kept time okay, but it's not really a Swiss watch and it's not really a high end watch, although it looks like that to people who don't know watches. I've owned cheap watches that lasted many years. Should a $60 watch last more than a few years? You decide."
2,fairly nice.,Was expecting it to be a much bigger dial. it appears to be small. the chronograph is too small and does not work in synchronizing fashion. this watch's date does not change after 12 midnight. the date and day changes after 6.00am. this a major drawback of this watch. i have gifted it to one of my friend.
1,Invicta didn't last 6 months,"I purchased this watch because I liked its style and Amazon was running a sale for $65. Unfortunately, the watch failed to function within 6 months. I initially thought it was a battery and replaced it to notice the second hand was stuck in one place oscillating back and forth. I decided to send it back to Invicta for a warranty repair and after they received it, they demanded $28 dollars ""shipping"" charge to send it back. Can you say gouge... I can since I sent it to them via snailmail (USPS first class) with tracking and receipt confirmation for ~$3 US.Needless to say this was my last Invicta due to their poor quality and unacceptable warranty/shipping charges. I'm going back to Seiko!"
1,Worst watch ever,"Purchased this watch in Sept 2010. It stopped working after three months, just one month after the warranty expired. Took it to a watch repair store and was told it would cost more to fix it than I paid for it. The watch looks great but has a LONG history of problems. Stay away from this watch."
1,"Good luck, buyers!","I bought one Invicta 2876 because I read the reviews most of which are good. It was fine at first (good look and accurate). After one month (the time after which I couldn't return it to Amazon) it began to be 2-5 minutes late every day, and sometimes it just stopped. So I sent it back to Invitca to ""enjoy"" the free in-warranty repair (I use quotation because I had to pay $20 for S&H;, and think about the price of this watch!). After 3 months I received it back. Great news! No more 2-5 minutes late, only half minute late (I knew it because I had to adjust it every 5-6 days).I believe customers who gave the good reviews must have good experience, although I had a terrible one. So good luck, future buyers!"
2,Item differs from description,"I recently bought this watch because it looked really nice in the pictures and the price was right. When I received the watch, I was horrified to see that the face is not the navy blue color like the picture and description, but in fact is PURPLE. Ugghh! I first thought it might be the light I was holding it in - but its definitely purple. Not cool."
5,Good Deal,"Its a nice watch for the right price. The watch looks shiny and spanking new right out of the box. I have to agree that the dial will change colors from blue to purple upon white or yellow light. But who cares, two color dials are awesome. The trying to figure out the date (sun, mon, etc) configuration is difficult so i just twist the crown (per day) til its correct. Overall, I like my watch and I but you will too. ^_^"
4,Very Good Watch,"For the price this is an amazing watch, the only minus is that the second time clock some times is to sensitive that it might lose syncronization with the main wath."
4,Invicta Men's Collection Watch #2876 Review,"The watch is beautiful and I am very happy with it, but I found the picture on line to be slightly misleading because the strap appears to be thicker in the picture in relation to the face of the watch and the coloration on the face of the watch also appears different in the picture, as it seems that it has wisps of lighter more icy looking blue besides the sapphire that make it look more interesting than it actually is. It just seems like some very skillful photographic enhancements make the watch look slightly different than it actually is..."
4,nice watch,I received this watch for Christmas other than the directions not being correct I see nothing wrong with it. nice sporty yet elegant watch...
5,Great watch!,This is a beautiful watch. I would highly recommend it. It is a heavy watch but nothing you wouldn't find in a high quality watch like Rolex or Tag. I actually prefer the weight and size of it. the band came a little large so for $10 i went to Sears and had it resized. It keeps time perfectly and I've had a lot of positive comments on it. I'll definitely buy more Invicta watches.
5,Beautiful watch.,"It's really impressive when you receive this watch, everybody liked it at work, in the picture you probably don't like the band, but believe me, the blue color dial is just beautiful and the band is not bad, i also bought the brown dial and is also really nice, and excellent price too."
5,Very Nice Watch,As expected Invicta watches are stylish and keep great time. This is a very nice watch and works great.
1,Price Change/ Look at 4,"The price was around $80 it has since jumped to $200... It is also a VERY CHEAP watch, look at the 4 and you will see it says llll NOT lV If they can not even catch this mistake how do you know there is not a problem inside the watch??? It is not even worth $80..."
1,Price Change,"The price changed from 69.99 to 119.99 :-(ALSO, LOOK at the 4 spot...It is llll and not lV...That just shows how cheap it is..."
3,Could be better...,"Bought this watche to use daily (will give it to my brother),i have two tag heuer, and we can not compare it with an tag, but a have seen many people doing it, beware you get what you paid for, the watche works and that is it, also the box have a very strange smell you can not face it for a long time, i will not buy another invicta again. It was not made for me."
1,Didnt last for 1 day.,"I take the watch out from its yellow box it was brand new.The buttons below and above the crown are so poorly made it.I can not even describe how bad they are. They dont have a screw or a lock function soyou will be chancing the date without noticing it. It is really easy trust me. Buttons are horrible.The main problem is, watch last me only 10 minutes. It stoped after 10 minutes. Wasnt a battery problem.Mechanism in the watch was broken. Yeah... Go figure it out..."
1,Terrible Quailty.,I had this watch for 3 years and went through 3 batteries. It does not keep time anymore. Looks nice but is a wasted purchase!
3,looks nice,"this watch looks nice, smaller than what I expected, but the major problem with it was 1 day after I got the watch started to delay time by 20 mins.; I thought it might be the battery and as recommended by Amazon.com, I took it to a watch store and changed the battery , 1 day later started to do it again ....I didn't take anymore chances and return it to amazon.com. The only positive thing about this experience is that I returned it for a full refund and didn't have to pay for shipping. I already bought my new seiko from amazon.com"
1,Had this watch for 2 weeks and it already broke!!!,This is my first invicta watch and probably my last. It was delivered in a very nice looking box.The watch looks beautiful and it has a very nice weight to it.Well after 2 weeks i started having problems with it. First the main dial used to adjust the min and hr started pulling out by itself. It happen like 3 times so i just thought it was my fault because i kept putting my hands in my pocket. Which might cause the dial to get caught in the jean. So i stopped putting my hand in my pocket. But it still happens. Then one day it just died. i'm glad i can still return it.but i'm very disappointed because its a very nice watch for the price.
3,Nice but very thick,"Note: Many of today's better watches are thick, but here are my thoughts on this watch.The watch is beautiful, but looking at the side of it, the watch is VERY thick. I have a self-winding Seko dive watch, and of all my watchs, the self-winding watch is the only one thicker than this watch -- but not much thicker. In my opinion, it is stange that this watch is as thick as a self-winding dive watch. I have always considered the Seko dive watch to be too thick for normal day-to-day wearing, so I guess this watch could be considered too thick for normal use except by those with extra-large wrists. The picture does not show this of course; it really needs a side angle.Believe me ... it is probably thicker than you expect or want. Look at the specs. The band is a nice 20mm wide, but the case thickness is 11mm. The thickness of the case is over half of the width of the band !!"
5,Walking with Dinosaurs Collection,"I saw this program on TV several years back and loved it. Thought it would be good for my 7 year old who is facinated by dinosaurs and she loved it. It's very educational, as well as, entertaining."
5,Ultimate dinosaur dvd set for kids too,"This set is a must have for any dinosaur lover. My future paleontologists, Will (5 years) and Annelise (2 years), watched these every day for the first six months. We've had the set for a year now, and we still watch about twice a month. Whenever a playmate comes over, he or she requests watching a dvd from the Walking With collection. The kids especially like to watch in the van. They are fun to view, informative, well-organized, beautiful, timeless and interesting for all ages."
4,Great for education and entertainment!,"This is a great collection. It allows you to purchase a set of some of the best shows ever made about the dinosaurs and prehistory, yet it isn't too expensive.The shows are obviously influenced by nature programs in that they take the viewer on a journey by telling a little story about the lives of many extinct creatures. The somewhat outdated CGI and extra effort put into the programs allows a person to better understand how they might have looked, moved, sounded and thrived on this planet many years ago.If you're interested in dinosaurs/prehistoric life or you know someone who is, I would most definitely suggest picking this one up. Also, I would get the Walking with Monsters program too, as it gives you a fairly good foundation on life before the dinosaurs."
5,The Best Dinosaur Documentary!,"For anyone who enjoys learning new things or for those of you who enjoy watching documentaries, this is the one for you! The Walking with Dinosaurs series is the absolute best source for information on these extinct creatures. Using puppets & computer animation along with real settings and backgrounds, the filmmakers have made an awe-inspiring documentary. You almost forget that the dinosaurs aren't really there.This is a must see for adults and children alike!"
3,Wagon,"The product served its purpose here on a school project. However, it was not very durable and did not survive very long after the school project."
3,The Doctor is an enjoyable release that has it's moments ...,"There are some great songs on this release. Take Me To The Top. It's Only Love. Some good ones, like 'It's Up To You', 'Kiss Me Red' and 'Name of the Game' to name a few. I think this album shows that even when Cheap Trick misfires with bad production, dated drum effects on some lesser, more experimental material they still put out a fun release that is entertaining and worth a listen. I would not say this is Cheap Trick's best effort, but even a mediocre Cheap Trick CD has a lot more going for it than most other bands top material. I enjoyed it, but not an elite release by one of America's All-Time Greatest Rock and Roll bands."
3,"This album takes a lot of negaive heat, some unnecessary!","Yes, this is largly considered their worst album, and it hasn't aged well with me, but it's not a total waste. It's Only Love is perhaps my favorite Cheap Trick song ever, and Kiss Me Red has held up well. ANYTHING on this album is still better than The Flame, IMHO!"
2,Too Many Doctors In The Kitchen,"This is the only Cheap Trick album to have left my collection. I consider myself a die hard fan, but this album had exactly two good songs (""Kiss Me Red"" and ""Take Me To The Top""), and wretchedly out of character production, forcing keyboards over Nielsen's guitars and blanding out Bun E.'s drums. It sounded like a completely different band. ""The Doctor"" showed a patient on life support. Give it a pass, and pray it remains out of print."
3,"Dated , but not all bad","This got a bad rap when it came out back in the 80s. I started pulling out some of my old Trick CDS after hearing their fantastic new one. Doctor has some weak moments but overall it's still an interesting listen. It's Up To You is a good opener but is dragged down by some cheesy keyboards. I really like Kiss me Red and Take Me to the Top. But, they save the best for last in the wonderful It's Only Love. If you're a Trick fan, you gotta have this one!"
2,The Doctor.,"When this came out in 1986, Rockford Ill.'s Cheap Trick was really on their last legs, albums just were not selling anymore, and ""The Doctor"" all but put the last nail in the coffin, on this release. Too much 80's production kills it, but I gave it 2 stars, because they had a few good songs in, ""It's Up To You"", ""Take Me To The Top"", (Should of been a radio hit) and ""Good Girls Go To Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)"". The rest is almost worthless. Thank goodness they got their act back together, since 1988 they have released around 10 more disc's, all very good to excellent except ""Busted"" (1990), which was a stinker like this one."
3,"One great song, nine decent songs","""The Doctor,"" a bouncy, musically and lyrically biting rocker, is one song from THE DOCTOR that I would place on a Cheap Trick best-of collection. The other nine aren't that bad but just aren't that good. The sum of THE DOCTOR's parts do not equal its whole. Even ""Kiss Me Red,"" the would-be hit single, blends in with, rather than standing out from, the other tracks. Cheap Trick fans will want THE DOCTOR. More casual music fans should first try CHEAP TRICK AT BUDOKAN, STANDING ON THE EDGE, ONE ON ONE or CHEAP TRICK(the first album)."
4,TRICK SEES THE DOCTOR,"I REALLY LIKED THIS ALBUM, AND IT WAS A SHAME THAT IT DID NOT TURN OUT THAT WAY FOR THE BAND. THE COLLBORATION WITH NIELSEN AND ZANDER REALLY CAME THROUGH. ""TAKE ME TO THE TOP"" IS WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION ALONE. I LOVED THE VIDEO, AND RICKS DOCTOR GUITAR. I WOULD SAY THAT LISTENING TO THIS HELPED ME GET THROUGH SOME CHANGING TIMES, AND IT WAS THE FIRST CT ALBUM THAT I BEGAN TO REALLY READ INTO THE LYRICS. I READ THAT BUN E. WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM, AND THAT THE STUFF WAS NOT STRONG LIVE. AND HE IS RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT IS THE DOCTORS' APPEAL. IT WAS A DIFFERENT ALBUM FOR TRICK TO MAKE. THEY WENT INTO IT WITH GREAT IDEAS, AND IT BECAME THE DOCTOR. JUST WANT EVERY ONE TO KNOW THAT THIS ALBUM GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS TRICKS OTHER RELEASES. MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO LISTEN THROUGH IT, BUT AS I SAID, ROBIN IS IN TOP FORM. TAKE A CHANCE AND GO SEE THE DOCTOR!!!"
5,Monster GFX!,"This card rocks! I plugged it into my new Xfire motherboard, and whooosh it took off like a rocket! Can't find a 3d game that doesn't run with all setting at MAX. How sweet it is! Great support. Make sure your BIOS and mb drivers are up to date. Install latest Catalyst Drivers from ATI website. Because this card is FRESH. Using 1280 X 1024 resolution. Runs very cool."
5,Happy with this purchase.,"Printer ribbons for the Epson 880 Printer are far from cheap. Luckily with my search on line, Amazon came through with a good price. I saved at least $10 by not buying from (other retailers). Thanks Amazon. By the way, the Epson 880 is a great printer."
1,Interesting life- poorly written,"This book was in desperate need of a ruthless editor. Mr. Donaldson has lived an interesting life, but the book is difficult to get through because of redundancy, lack of focus, and awkward prose."
4,fun to play with,"Haven't found it's true potential, but It defines hot spots in the oven, and cold spots in the refrigerator and if the double pane windows are working or not."
1,Bad Laser,"This is the worst, this is my second infrared Thermometer wish I had not given my first away. I will never buy this brand again. At five inch's away the laser is off by 1 inch. useless laser pointer.I've lost the receipt so this ones going in trash. What a waste of eighty bucks."
1,Not the jersey you get.....,The picture is not of the jersey you get. Last years jersey is what came in the mail. Contacted the seller and they knew the picture was wrong but offered nothing for incorrect picture. Not happy with this purchase and this seller. They lost a customer over this. You should get the jersey that is in the picture! Amazon should not be proud to have this seller on their site.
1,Piece of Junk,Record Rewind Pause Live Tv On Computer Capture Tv Video ImagesCouldn't get it to work. Had to return it. What more is there to say? Title tells it.
5,Very Nice Collection,"With the exception of True Lies, these are some of the best guy movies of all time. Not that True Lies is bad, it just lacks the incredible violence factor that is almost a necessity of a good guy movie; it trades that off for a more of a ""cutesy"" mass appeal. Overall, however, I think it provides a nice counterpoint to the other movies"
4,Good advice,Most couples disagree over children. The next emotional issue is usually money. This book allows one to step back and look at the details of a reasonable distribution of assets and debts. It covers areas that one does not always think of during a stressful time. Handy as an overview and a checklist.
5,An absolute must-have for any divorcing couple,"It's not unusual to see bitter divorces, and the source of such bitterness is often money. Now in a fully updated and expanded ninth edition, ""Divorce & Money: How to Make the Best Financial Decisions During Divorce"" is a guide to money side of divorce. Chapters cover how to deal with touchy matters through applying even-handed, level-headed wisdom, and how to craft outcomes that should leave both parties satisfied. Guiding divorcees through the process of evaluating their assets, dealing with taxes, child support, and more, Violet Woodhouse gives a complete and comprehensive breakdown on the economic side of splitting up. ""Divorce & Money"" is an absolute must-have for any divorcing couple."
3,Good advice,"Given that in a divorce settlement, most of the issues come down to money and how to split up assets (and debt), this book seemed like it would cover most of the questions one has when working through a divorce. It covers investments, real estate, alimony and child support, tax returns, etc. There is advice for dealing with attorneys and mediators as well. This is all great information, but I actually wanted more. Nothing seemed to go very in-depth. While there was some good advice, there is no CD-rom for drafting agreements and nothing really concrete to use. Unless you really have a lot of complicated investments, assets, etc. I think one of Nolo's basic divorce books would be more helpful."
3,Good movie. Came regioned though,Great movie. Total mindscrew. Disc came in good shape. No cover but that was stated in the sale. Unfortunately it came as a uk region movie so it wouldn't play on my players. Not a bad product just be sure to double check that it will play with your stuff
5,"Daddy, Could You Love Me?","I John Turner, received this letter about my book, I am extremely proud of this little girl. Dear Mr. Turner, how are you? I'm Jasmine Coleman. I bought your book, Daddy, Could You Love Me? Thank you for signing it. I also listened to your song. It's great. I did a book report on your book. In case you're wondering, I made a very good grade on it. if you make another book I'll look forward to reading it. Your Fan ,Jasmine Coleman P.S. how do you come up with what you write? This little girl looks to be about 9, or 10 years old. isn't this a great book review!! Wish I could show you the letter, it's in big block letters."
1,Search engine is defective,"I searched for a belt tensioner using our vehicle year, make and model! This Dayco tensioner was at the top of the list. WHY?it was twice the size of the one on our car, yet it was specifically listed as for our car.Beware, this is not the first time I've had such a problem"
4,Great Watch,Really like the Dragon Lupah. It is a large watch that gets noticed a lot. Invictas are well built for the price and Amazon offers the best prices and service. Thanks!!
1,Invicta Men's Lupah Collection Dragon Chronograph Watch #2093 (Purchased on 10/22/2009),The watch came with one hand missing. No item replacement available. I returned and still waiting for the refund.
5,Great Watch,Great watch. It gets plenty of attention because of it's size. Very heavy. I'm a little worried about the crystal scratching because it does stick out so much but the watch looks and feels amazing. Probably going to purchase another.
3,It's Okay Quality,"It's Missing A Few Pages Though , I hope I dont need those, but other than that its good for the price"
2,"Too expensive, get MSN Messenger which is free","The Ojo fails exactly where the previous video phones have failed: it's way too expensive, even before the ""generous"" mail-in rebate which will take months to receive if ever. For $50 or so you can get two webcams with video and audio quality just as good as (if not better than) the Ojo and then just get MSN Messenger which is free and has the best video phone quality and features, even over slow Internet connections."
2,Great Idea; Poor Execution,"I bought this hood so that the light from my 12"" Powerbook wouldn't disturb my wife late at night when I'm working in bed. It has two problems. 1) the folding instructions are utterly incomprehensible. I have -- I think -- pretty good spatial relationship skills and I had to spend about 5 minutes on the phone with the manufacturer before I could figure out how to fold it down so it fits in its storage pouch. 2) the sides of the hood are angled inward so much that your eyes have to be about 12"" from the screen to see the whole screen. That's WAY too close."
3,Almost Good Enough,"I use this mostly in the car while processing pictures in photoshop on a MacBook pro. It really helps deal with the glare, and I admit I wouldn't be able to edit at all without it. However, it's just not quite big enough to block all the light and inevitably some glare finds its way onto my screen. So I couldn't live without this thing, I just wish it was bigger and blocked more light."
2,Returned after a week,"The most important thing is that it works to block the glaring sun outside. But, if you add just a bit of wind you'll find yourself either using one hand to stabilize it or using various hacks such as binder clips.It is adjustable to smaller screens using metal snaps, but this is also it's biggest fault, in that the snaps tend to scratch the edges on larger screens. A small breeze and you'll watch in horror how the metal clips run up and down the black glass part of your unibody Macbook Pro. It's a shame because the product did work well outside it's faults."
2,Really not a cuttlefish,Although it is listed as a cuttlefish it really doesn't look like one and my grandson was disappointed in it.
4,Henry P. Willis Is an Author Who Should Be Better Known,"I have read numerous works by Henry P. Willis, and it continues to admaze me that the mainline publishing industry continues to ignore him. His latest work, ""The Future Climate of Planet Earth,"" is a classical example of the care to detail and research that Mr. Willis has applied to a complex issue.In this particular book, Henry Willis has taken great care to write on the very complex issue of global climate change in a manner that can be clearly understood by the average reader. He provides extensive definitions and Internet resources to substantiate his conclusions.This is a definitive reference work that any person concerned about global climate change should have in their library. If you want to gain an understanding regarding global climate change, then this book is a must read."
4,Marked improvment,Much better sound quality than using radio transmitter and much cheaper than replacing the stock stereo. Easy to install (on a tacoma) and only slightly confusing on how to operate.definitely worth the money. Have mine installed so that the wire comes out of the center console. So when console is closed no wires are visible.
5,2006 Tacoma,"Bought and installed in my 2006 Tacoma (w/factory stereo). Installed in 15 minutes (pry out the climate control panel, remove four bolts, slide out radio and plug in the new cables). Works great in hybrid mode (lets you use the factory CD player controls or the IPOD's controls to control the IPOD). Text display works fine with the Tacoma stereo."
4,"Good, but charging difficulties","While the product is easy to install (once you have access to the back of your stereo which, depending on your vehicle, can be quite a trial) and functions well, it is unable to charge the last couple generations of iPods. This is a problem they have supposedly fixed, and all new products contain a cable that will allow charging, but if it is the same as the replacement cable they sent me (for an extra $20), then it will not work.On the plus side, I purchased it from Pacific Stereo and I cannot say enough good things about them and their customer service. Really, they went so far out of their way to make sure I was as satisfied a customer as possible that it was embarrassing."
1,Just got it because it is the only one that works with my car,"It works, but is totally useless when flipping through albums, it only flips through playlists and is really glitchy. I can't see what song I am selecting and it does not show it on my mark Levingston screen. I had to use it on hands on mode to scroll through and can only flip through it when at a stop light. Its a super weak product, I mean with all the touch screen moving technology out there. I feel like its a Radioshack product. Someone really needs to step up and make a nice moving screen IPOD MP3 player attachment. It glitches sometimes between songs, and most times when the car starts up it goes directly to the first song on your IPOD in alphabetic order. BOo"
3,"Quite happy, as long as it lasted","After surfing many product comparison pages, the USA Spec PA15-Toy interface emerged as the best option out there, and I was very happy with the one I bought in April.Heres the good:Played music thru my factory interfaceCharged IphoneWorked well with phone calls etcAnd the bad-Stopped working after five months:Lost all volume on Iphone inputLost Left channel on aux inputand- drum roll- because the unit was bought through an unauthorized dealer, no warranty!In summary, buy at your own risk. If you get a good unit, you will be happy. If you get a bad unit or the warranty is up...you takes your chances.Thanks for reading and hop this helps."
3,"Seems to work well, but . . .","It is kind of an adventure finding songs with the adapter through the radio, It is a 1st gen ipod mini, and a 2003 Avalon, so I'm not sure where the trouble lies, but the text function does not work with this. If you have many tunes, good luck finding what you are looking for. The good side: it is nice to be able to skip tracks, and play lists, and if it is in the right mode, use fast forward and reverse through the radio controls. It also has better tone than the cassette adapter I was using before. All in all, I like the product. The shipping was super unbelievable. Placed the order on a Saturday night, and got it Monday afternoon with standard shipping. Like the product, love the store."
2,Sorta works,"Sound quality is good. Install is super easy.If set to ""headunit control"", then the display does not show song title as advertised. When I'm using the radio, the headunit will often revert back to CD mode, even when no iPod is installed.If I did it again, I would just spend the extra $100 and get a new headunit."
3,Starsky Directs Schwarzenegger,"Solid Ahnuld vehicle works best when it's satirizing TV game/""reality"" shows, thanks to the (then) perfect casting of Richard Dawson, adequate in the shoot-em-up sequences. Steven DeSouza's one liners aren't quite up to the ones in the magnificent ""Commando"", but I enjoyed it."
3,"Run, Forest, Run!",Market face Schwarzenegger is a renegade in the future trying to escape the country when he is caught and forced on convict killing game show for a multiconglomerate scumbag. Extremely entertaining cheapie-looking movie full of funny dialogue catch phrases and violent action to please vets and patriots. One complaint: The stupid scene for the opening of the show includes uncommonplace degrading of women.
3,Going Politics,"A good boy character murdered all bad boys used factulaly by the US authorities to execute convicts by deploying the sadist killers satisfying themselves before millions of bloodthirsty watchers of a popular TV show broadcast round the States of the 2017 (a centenary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia), transformed into a Stalin Gulag on a higher technological level.I do not remember since when Mr. A. Schwarzenegger is the CA Governor trying, eventually, to prevent such developments he was warning of in a produce of 2002."
4,Very watchable,"Obviously not one of the best or maybe even one of Arnold's best, but I have enjoyed watching all or parts of it several times and I don't get tired of it. Isn't that what you want in a film you are going to shell out bucks to have your own copy of?"
4,Good action film,Ben Richards(Schwarzenegger) is a wrongfully accused felon who must compite in a deadly game show called the Running Man in order to pay its sentence.The year is 2017 and this game is run by the goverment who wants to control the crowd in order to rule with iron hand.Helped by two mates and a woman(Conchita Alonso) they must escape from the stalkers the game persuants that won't stop at anything to kill all the contestants.With the help of the underground resistance they must decode a satellite link upcode to crack the show and reveal the truth to the audience.With a cold and witty host Killian(Dawson) the show is the first game show in the US.It's Showtime!!
5,"Behind T2, this is Arnie's best film","Arnie has done some fantastic roles, and as an owner of the Arnie DVD four pack, I can say that I own some of his best work. Not only does he rip out some great one liners in this movie, but it's got some great action, and the social relevance to some of the ""extreme"" game shows out now is downright scary.The basic premise of the film is just amazing. Arnie does his usual role of one man army, taking out some cleverly thought of enemies. While a lot of the effects look cheesy by today's standards, I think this film is perfect. The supporting characters are kind of weak, except for a very cool Richard Dawson, but what do you expect. Any movie with the balls to cast a Zappa is awesome in my opinion.Ultimately, you need to own this DVD if you like Arnie. If you love Arnie, buy the DVD four pack instead. While Commando isn't fantastic (save for those great one liners), the other three movies are Arnie classics."
2,"schwarzenegger bombs in this turkey,but richard dawson shines as the anti-gameshow host","the two stars i gave this turkey is for richard dawson as the running man host damon killian,he steals this movie and makes it his. using every gameshow trick he ever had dawson turns killian into the anti-gameshow host as he deals death and prizes out to the masses. richard dawson should have gotten an oscar nod for his funny and scarey turn in this otherwise waste of a movie. ""let's play the feud,i mean the running man"""
1,Where's the Widescreen Version?,"I purchased the Special Edition DVD precisely because I wanted a clean widescreen version of the Running Man for my movie collection.Imagine my disappointment when playing the Widescreen DVD and seeing the full screen version. Wait, maybe they messed up the labeling and the full screen disc actually has the Widescreen version.No.Tried to find a Customer Service NumberNo such thing.So, if you want two identicle full screen discs of the Running Man, here you go!Thanks for nothin' Artisian Home Entertainment! I'll be returning this DVD for a refund."
5,The Running Man,Great movie. Loved every second of it years ago and still enjoy it. Bought it from Amazon a few months ago and have watched it at least 3 times since. I don't know if I'm showing my age or what but I still prefer the older movies to the newer ones. Even the special effects in the running area were great. I'd suggest this if you like movies with a lot of fighting without a lot of gore.
4,A pretty Descent Arnold 80's action flick,"This is a pretty good movie for arnold. Taking a different direction from his last few blow-em up shoot-em up type movies (terminator,commando,raw dea), this type, arnold is running for his life instead of the bad guys. Their is plenty of good action, with some great hand to hand fights, and even the ""fake"" fight with jesse ventura is a pretty descent fight between them. The villain/s are good, a hockey bladed foe, a chainsaw wielding bast ard, a flame thrower, and an electic shockin man all provide a challenge for arnold to defeat. But whats an Arnold movie without the occasional shootout. IN the beginning prison escape, arnold is caught up in the middle of a shoot out, and at the end he is also caught in a viscious gun fight. A lot of diverse action.........it delivers"
4,Ahead of its time..,"Ok, first off I'll say that I'm not a big Arnold fan, and the movie is campy and silly at times. That said, the concept of a futuristic TV show that kills people off for entertainment of the masses is truly prophetic. Think about all the enourmously popular 'reality' TV shows of today. How long will it be before the decision is made to air shows that actually show people getting killed? I'm not talking about news reports here, I'm talking about people being killed for purely entertainment purposes, perhaps with a bit of prize money dangled in front of them. Are we really that far away from the modern-day equivalent of the Roman Colllesium? And we all know what happened to Rome soon after their population lost all sense of decency and compassion."
5,A lot of fun.,"Yes, this movie follows all the cliches of 80's action films. But, how many of those 80's action were as fun and funny as The Running Man? This is one of my favorite Arnie movies, after the Terminator films. If you have read the Stephen King book but have not seen this movie and are planning too, I have one suggestion:forget the book. The movie has a higher entertainment value. When Arnie gets his revenge on the host of the show, you will feel like laughing and standing up and cheering. Jesse Ventura's appearance is absolutely hilarious and has an extremely high 'I don't blame for being angry one bit' factor. When you see the movie you will understand what I mean. Maria Conchita Alonso's character is also extremely likable. And Arnie is surprisingly fantastic."
2,Just Another Mindless Dose of Arnold-Packed Silliness,"This is a tricky one to critique, because it's devastatingly stupid in every single imaginable way, but that's also precisely what makes it such a silly, reckless good time. In many ways it's the prototypical Arnold Schwarzenegger action vehicle: tons of bad one-liners, genuinely awful action sets, a romantic subplot with zero chemistry and a retreaded sci-fi premise are only the most glaring notes on its loaded rap sheet. That he's backed by two of the genre's most notorious overactors in Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown just amplifies the insanity, while a carefree, pun-loaded screenplay is only too happy to take advantage. Former Family Feud host Richard Dawson is noteworthy as the conniving silver age comic book villain behind the whole mess, a role he clearly loved playing. Mind-numbingly simple and eye-poppingly profane, it's the best bad movie you'll see all month."
2,"this is a ""so what"" kinda film","This is a pretty run of the mill formula flick, with nothing whatsoever to add to the genre of dystopias that are fragile enough to be destroyed by a single toughie. While I admit that I used to enjoy these films for the action and explosive violence as a kid, I have seen so many as an adult that they bore me to no end. Arnold isn't so bad, it is just that the story is unbelievably banal.Not recommended, unless you want to waste 2 hours, which at times is exactly what I would want to do, that is, with a good movie."
5,I'll Be Back!!!,"The Running Man on Blue Ray was absolutely great! I was like 5-7 years old when this movie 1st came out & I have loved it for years. I had a VHS copy when I was a little guy & it got played quite often. I'm 32 years old now & I hadn't seen it in 10 or 15 years, it was nice when I got my copy and enjoyed one the good Arnold movies w/ my wife.(I am not saying my wife was in the movie, her & I watched it together)"
4,A true classic!,"I used to love this movie. This movie is such a great mixture of enormous plot holes, ultraviolence and phenomenally bad Schwarzenegggerjokes, that it is just pure fun to see all actors take things so serious! In the future criminals are being punished live on television during the Running Man game show by sadistic scum (one of Schwarzenegger's quotes during the movie) Of course the big former Austrian is also put on the show as a criminal contester and guess what happens? This truly is a classic! (SARR)"
3,Unbelievable Liberal Propaganda in extras,"I'm love Arnold movies, and this one was one of my favorites from the 80's. In the re-mastered version there a documentary called lock down. This political liberal crap does not belong on this DVD. It's quite clear that these people have truly lost their minds now. If I knew ahead of time this was on the DVD I may not have bought it. The movie is very clear and sound quality is good."
2,Ridiculous extras,"What do you get when you combine interviews with people from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other random idiots? Think it's a protest taking place in Washington, or a news story on slashdot.org or your favorite left-wing website? Nope, it's a ""special feature"" on the Running Man special edition DVD. Apparently the studio responsible for this release decided tinfoil hat politics would help sell the movie. Yep, nothing like 30 minutes of ""THE GUVMINT'S SPYING ON US!!!111"" And I sincerely hope this mistake is not repeated. I'm an avid movie watcher but if heavily-biased political commentary like this starts showing up in DVDs on a regular basis I'll just find something else to do with my 15-20 bucks per movie. I've got better things to do with my time and money than support wackos like this.Oh, and the movie itself was pretty decent."
1,The Running Man (Special Edition) NOT,"Better luck Artisan Entertainment. Please remaster this title again. This has got to be the worst widescreen transfer on DVD. The print used for this SE looks like it was the same one used on the bare bones edition DVD. There is alot of pronounced grain and muddyness throughout. I think the person who had the two pan and scan discs had a defective version. There is a anamorphi widescreen version. But it is a really bad print. Also, Artisan, Please go back and put the DTS audio on this disc. There is no DTS there. When I selected the DTS option, there was no DTS trailer at the beginning of the feature. Having the DTS trailer there is a hallmark of quaility. Instead my player played the sound in Dolby SR stereo. This DVD falls below the DVD's you have put out in the past. This is a tranfer that falls short of expectations. This disc needs to be recalled. I fully intend to return this disc and get a refund."
1,Read the book instead,"I read the book by Stephen King and I loved it! This movie is NOTHING like the book. The basic plot (and I mean VERY basic) is the same, but the events that take place aren't even close. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this sad excuse for a movie. I was very disappointed and I recommend to everyone READ THE BOOK INSTEAD!"
3,Why does this always happen?,"I can see changing a few minor details here and there to smooth out production and make the movie more digestible to the general public, but this is crossing the line. They butchered the Running Man just like they butchered Relic by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. They both have epic plots and two of the best sets of characters I've ever seen. Neither movie stays true to the book...or even close. The most frustrating reality of it is that both movies would have been SO MUCH better had they done so. They say King(Bachman) novels don't translate to the screen? How will we ever know if hollywood continues to twist plots and butcher storylines for a buck? Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, almost really good. But if you looking for the movie version of the Bachman novel... well......there isn't one. Sorry."
2,I agree with an earlier review,"I agree with an earlier reviewer: Arnold should have tickled the spanish chick's feet when she was tied up and barefoot. What's her name, Maria Chiquita Banana or something?"
2,Not better than DVD,"This Bluray disc is not much better than a DVD. I like to watch Bluray because of the high def sound and picture. Some transfers are just not worth it. If you own it on DVD, stick with it."
3,Not that bad,"In a postapocalyptic world, the government frames Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) for a bloody massacre. He's given the option of staying in jail for life or participating in a ""gladiator""-type game show that usually leads to death. He opts for the show, teaming with other contestants to survive the game and overthrow the corrupt system. This sci-fi thriller costars Richard Dawson in a twisted send-up of his game-show-host persona."
4,THE SHORT STORY IS MUCH BETTER-BUT A GOOD MOVIE,"It's hard to believe that the Running Man is based on a Stephen King short story. I probably would have enjoyed the movie more not knowing this. Stephen King's short story is completely different than the movie and much better. As far as the movie itself, it is very fun and exciting to watch.A typical Arnold action flick. The characters (especially the stalkers) are very colorful and well cast. Schwarzenegger is the undisputed king of the fun to watch action flick. Check out Total Recall and Terminator 1&2 also. Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon when there is no football on TV!!!"
5,So very Mad Phat Movie!,"This movie was mad awesome! The music was sensational, the plot was what ""The Most Dangerous game"" should have been, and I love the quote: ""I Haven't Been In the buisness as long as you. But I'm a quick learner, And I'm going to give them what they want."" and then he slams Killian into the luger. This was one of Arnolds Greatests!"
3,"NOT THE BEST, BUT DEFINITELY NOTE WORTHY","Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the ""running man"" which (if you've seen the movie know it's a game show.) I really did enjoy this movie. I have seen Arnold Schwarzenegger in better roles, but the action is really good and it's a movie I love to watch again from time to time. If you haven't seen it, GO FOR IT. I believe you will like it, if not love it."
3,Not great but worth watching,"I have yet to see a movie with more naive and silly plot than this one. The story is so foolish you would not believe. The plot has too many holes. I would say the whole story line is a big, big hole. The actions and fights were not far from being substandard. But I still would give a credit to it. ""The Running Man"" was a great and a very original show to watch. The stalkers were real monsters; they looked and acted like killer machines. The most terrific stalker was definitely ""Subzero"". The picture quality of this DVD, by the way, is poor."
2,What was he thinking?,"Arnold has made a lot of 3 or 4 star outa 5 star movies in my opinion & he had to make this one. What for? This one has no good story and just isnt a very good sci fi film. The action was fairly poor I thought! Once the game starts,everything is way downhill from there. Normally in arnold movies, the plot isnt the best, but it still entertains you, which this one seizes to do. It seizes to entertain you."
1,Did any of the good reviewers even read the book?,"This movie SUCKS! Period. I read the book by Stephen King and it rocked. This disasterpiece trashed, wrecked, and destroyed the book. You want to see Arnold in a real film? See Terminators 1 and 2. Ignore this rubbish and stick to the book."
1,Purlease,"This movie looked like it fell out of a cereal box it was that tacky and dreadful. I am a Schwarzenegger fan and I have to say I was very disappointed in 'The Running Man'. The plot is surprisingly dull and unimiginative for a futuristic action flick and the adaption from S. King's original book is appallingly dissimilar. If you've seen the great Arnie action movies: Predator, The Terminator and T2 and Total Recall then expect a big drop in quality from these to 'The Running Man'. Only for a very rainy day, 1 star."
4,The Running Man,This is an old movie. I still like it and the plot is good. The picture is not like the new movies of today but still the picture was okay. I recommend this movie and it does have alot of action.
5,See Ar-Nuld Kill All The Big Bad Dudes!!!(And Ms. Alonso Is HOT!!!),"This is actually a pretty good adapatation of a Stephen King book which is a rarity in itself. It concerns a Futuristic Earth where a game show sends ""Stalkers"" out to hunt down and kill their victims. This is kind of like World Wrestling with a BIG shot of Testosterone. Once again Ar-nuld walks away without a scratch from his many fights and a big PLUS for this movie is the presence of the beautiful Mara Conchita Alonso who has a very sexy accent!!!This lady is an actressof tremendous talent and it is a real shame that we do not see enough of her in movies these days."
2,ANOTHER STEPHEN KING NOVEL THAT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO SCREEN,"Enjoyable film, but hardly worthy of any accolades in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. The only plus was to see RICHARD DAWSON (former host of THE FAMILY FEUD) as the antagonist TV HOST/PRODUCER from hell. Quite a contrast from his lovable persona on THE FAMILY FEUD. Otherwise, one is better off sticking to the novel."
3,Comprehensive but Dry,"Barbara Levick writes books about the ""boring"" emperors, Tiberius, Claudius, and now Vespasian. The challenge is to bring these emperors to life without having the wild anecdotes of Caligula or Nero available. The problem is compounded here since the narrative source material on Vespasian is very limited.Levick has done a wonderful job bringing together all the different kinds of evidence available concerning Vespasian. If there is something you want to know about Vespasian, it is probably in this book, or the references in the footnotes will tell you where to find it. However, the book fails to tell the story in a way that will interest anyone but scholars or diehard Roman history buffs. I count myself in the last group, and am glad I read it, but it was pretty dry at times."
2,I picked this book for a report,I found the book really boring. I did it for a school report and it was a convenience thing. I rented it on amazon but their TTS (text To speech)was horrible so I bought it from Google Play and It was fine. This Would be a awesome book for someone that likes Roman history in depth. The author does a really good job telling you about the life of Vespasian. I liked learning about him.
2,BIO ON NOT THE BEST KNOWN OF ROMAN EMPERORS,"""Vespasian"" is a bio on one of lesser known roman emperors. After a time of civil war he established the Flavian rule over the empire. The book is well written but not overly dramatic. It is rather dry telling of Vespasian's rise to power and rule with his sons over the expanding roman empire. The book is like reading a textbook. Maybe the author lectures better than she writes, she is a professor at Oxford. Levick cites a number of sources including such Flavian writers as Pliny the Elder and Josephus. I think in the end the reader would be better off reading those works than this book."
1,Did not even get the correct product.,"The pen I was sent is not even the correct product. Not made by Belkin. May have 4 functions, but they are not the same as advertised.The pen I received has a stylus, pen, led and laser. No pencil at all. Which was the major reason I ordered this item in the first place.Even if this item was what I ordered, the laser doesn't work properly.I am emailing the company ""Ebuy Always"" to see if the product can be replaced. Do order if you want the product described."
1,cool idea but I won't buy another,"Well, I thought it was a pretty cool idea. I was a little worried that I couldn't quite figure out how you were supposed to put new lead in the pencil part, but that didn't turn out to be a problem. Never used up first lead before it broke. It's an interesting concept, but it's a dud."
1,Keep your money . . .,After 1 week of use the barrel started to separate. Not worth the money I paid for it. Save your money--buy a rOtring or Lamy stylus pen.
1,it doesn't work,the clip got out from the pen's body so easy and it's lost. and now my pen doesn't work.
4,Castile for Isabella,"I only knew of Isabellanin passing from history class, her sending Columbus on his journey, and from books on Katherine of Aragon, her daughter, mentioning her love for her.Plaidy introduces Isabella before all of this. When she's young, not certain to inherit the throne of Castile, in danger from her brother, his wife and nobels of Spain.As usual Plaidy works her magic on history. You're drawn in from the very beginning. You sweat and remain calm when she does, you feel the hotness of Spain, you worry about her mother, her brother and you are rooting for her to get what she wants.I liked that Plaidy spends so much time on Isabella's world and the other people are supporting players within. It sets up nicely for the next books in the series.It was also a nice departure from the English series I've been reading and totally worth the detour."
5,organize quick and easy .......love it,"I love this program, so much so that I am trying to find a way of using it on my MAC. I use it on my PC with windows XP it runs beautifully, I use it in my medical practice"
2,fit,it works good but tight arowned the chin which puts persuer on ure nose would work great if had upper support
3,hate the look..,It's functional that's about all I can say. It moves everytime I try to talk and everybody makes fun of me for looking like a masked wrestler. Does keep the wind off your face though.
4,It is like a wetsuit for your face - frostbite fighter!,"So yeah, not super breathable, but super effective. It keeps the wind off your body parts, meaning nose and ears. With supporting gear it can be a little hard to breath, so if you are cluastrophobic, this is not for you. Inexpensive, fun and functional."
3,"Urban camo color is incorrectly tan not gray, otherwise nice quality face mask","Overall this face mask seems to be made of good quality, but be warned, the light gray color on the Urban camouflage mask that I received is completely incorrect and is tan. The pattern looks identical to the image pictured (even with the darks and lights in the exact same spot) except that the light gray shown in the photo is actually clearly tan on the real mask (similar to the tan of a woodland camo pattern) and is not at all how it appears in the photo. If the color was even close to gray I would have given this mask a higher rating because it seems to be overall good quality and a great price, but if you're looking for true urban camo pattern and color fidelity (rather than something looking closer to desert) look elsewhere."
4,Very Nice,"Fits really well seems warm enough for what mother nature can throw at you. Only bad thing it has more tan on it than I would prefer, Still looks sweet specially with my snow camouflage goggles by Polarlens."
4,"Warm, protective, nice fit (52cm hat)","i ordered the crash test dummy version of the mask. fits great, but gave it four stars because I had to trim below the eyes for better vision, and it was rubbing below my eye which would have been very uncomfortable snowboarding. took my time and now it fits perfect and you cant tell I did a thing. Thick foamy stretchy material was EXTREMELY WARM. quick to take off/on and velcro feels quite secure. Cant beat it at $9. Surprisingly comfy but WARM!"
2,just a novelty item,"this item isnt very well designed. its made well, but the nose hole is too far down, and it's uncomfortable around the nose no matter what you do. it would do a good job of keeping your face warm in high wind while snowmobiling or snowboarding if it didn't slide down every five seconds because the velcro strap on the back of your head (or should i say top of your neck) was set higher up on the back of the head. well made, just doesn't fit right/badly designed. + i dont have any crazy deformities on my head IE random appendages growing out or anything resembling a pack of hotdogs growing on the back of my neck. I have very average proportions, but this thing just wont fit brah. F that noise."
4,Kept my face warm!,"Used all winter, kept my face warm on the coldest days. I used in the snow and blistering cold air. The only negative is that it is slightly hard to breath with this on."
3,cool,it covers my face well and that's what it's meant for right? not sure what else to say about it
4,"Nose part is much too small, but still great","Yeah, I have a big Italian nose, but like some other reviewers have mentioned, the nose portion of this is just too small & flat. I mean it's still very wearable, but just makes the mask fit awkwardly.That said, I would not bike the frigid Minneapolis tundra without this mask. It's a face-saver."
1,!!! Not Desert !!!,"I order this product for when I ride my bike out here in Afghanistan, but the color is not Desert is more of a greenish color, like the ARMY, not USMC."
5,Great price,My son loves it even though it is a little big because it is an adult size. Thanks for a great prouct.
3,Too small and hard to breathe,"I bought this for my 12 year old son to wear for Halloween. He could barely fasten it, and when I tried to put it on, it would not fit me at all, so beware that it is very small. Also, it was hard to breathe in. It wasn't awful for trick or treating, my son said, but it doesn't seem like it would be good to use while doing any sort of physical activity. It does look cool and the quality seems good, but I would not buy it to use for a sport."
3,not what I expected.,"It may be because my face is too big but the nose-hole doesn't fit well over my nose, maybe if I was10, my nose would be the right size after running a round a bit, it is hard to breathe and too much pressure on my face cuts off air though the nose, should be OK after modification, but I don't think any male over the age of 10 has a nose small enough out of the package."
3,Nice Item. Company - not so much,"The mask itself is great. Warm, fits good, ventilates well and keeps moisture out. But the company took its dear sweet time in getting it to me. I placed the order 12/22 and it didnt ship until 1/12. The arrival estimate was 1/6 through 1/14, it arrived on 1/15. I probably could have found a store selling a similar item that functioned just as well and got it to me immediatly within that time period. During the winter months with this type of product; quick arrival is very important."
4,ski mask,"I realy like this it kepps your face warm ""sweaty"" but war....only drap back from me is that if you do not have it tight the mask tends to slide...besides that its great buy"
4,Pretty Gud,"mask does its job and is pretty comforting. problem is that it can get too hot if you have it on too long, doesnt do good in airsoft. id rather get a half mask but the mask looked pretty cool."
3,neoprene mask,"it is exactly as they said it was, neoprene mask, one size fits all. Sadly, it must be made for people with a small head. Mine has a brain inside so, it is larger than most. The velcro closure is not long enough. Consequently, I don't wear it. It sits on my winter wear shelf."
4,it looks better on the picture,"it looks better on the picture but is a good mask, not 5 stars `cose it doesn`t have a nose band"
5,No more cold while riding my ATV,"This is a good looking and practical face mask. Fits like a ""T"" and is comfortable. Good price as well. Came early and at this time of the year that's almost unheard of. Once my Marine buddies see this they'll be on-line in a heart beat. I'd highly recommend this product."
1,made for small faces,this mask did not fit my face at all i am 6ft tall and weigh 250lbs i don't have an abnormaly large face or head it fit my head fine it wraped around and fastend nicely but from forehead to chin it isn't long enough the nose and eye holes don't line up with your nose and eyes it clamps your mouth shut and makes it imposible to hear anything around you that said it was really well made from quality materail but i do not recomend unless u have a small face with odd placed eyes a tiny nose and no use for your ears
5,awesome,"I use it for freaking my kids out when they wont brush their teeth, as soon as they see it they brush as fast as they can just to get away from me...lol"
4,Great for the cold!,"I have two of these for cold weather motorcycling and bicycling. I have a 3/4 helmet so it will work even with my helmet on or a buff or neck gator pulled up onto my head. There's 2 issues with neoprene in general that's a negative for me. It fogs my glasses over because it doesn't vent quickly enough and my breath condenses moisture on the inside of the nose/mouth area. Depends on how far I'm riding, but I've had the condensate run down my chin into my coat before. Like I said, I don't know what to do differently because this is such an effective cold and wind blocker. I wash them after each use and leave them to dry at least a day so that's why I have two."
4,Better than a ski mask,"This actually works to keep your nose warm. And it stays in position much better than a ski mask. It also allows for better vision than a ski mask. I wear mine with the black side out as the ""glow in the dark"" side looks like something for Halloween. I would have given this 5 stars, but the Velcro fastener was positioned so that it would only properly fit someone with a very large head, or perhaps a woman with lots of hair. However, I added an extra patch of velcro which easily solved that problem. I far prefer this over your traditional knitted ski mask which tends to slip around and block your eyesight."
5,"One the Great ""Screwball"" Comedies","Decidedly racy for its time, the film tells the story of a small town spinster who secretly produces the most shocking and sexy novel of the decade--a novel so hot her own home town bans it from publication. Scandal follows upon scandal, with small town hypocrisy and big city morals lampooned at every turn. Irene Dunne offers the finest comedy performance of her long and distinguished career in a cast notable for exceptional performances over all.""Theodora Goes Wild"" easily bests earlier comedies such as ""It Happened One Night"" and contests the more widely known ""Bring Up Baby"" as the finest film of its genre. A must-have film you'll want to watch again and again."
1,Bought as Gift,It seems unfair to have to rate this book with a star since I bought this as a gift for my 6 year old grandsons who are reading at 3rd grade level but it is too hard for them. They have put it away for later. Need to work on more math skills first :-)No fault of the book because I'm not sure what age group it was for. Just a Grandmother error I suppose. But it doesn't seem age appropriate for 6 year olds unless they're math wizzards.
2,I wish it came with instructions,I will change my review to more stars if I can use the paddles as intended. There were no instructions and I can't find anything worth while online. The way I am using them they are pretty much no better than my webbed swim gloves - if that good.
4,"""UNPLUGGED"" MUY BUEN DISCO!","Esta produccion grabada ""En Vivo"" del duo de bachata MONCHY & ALEXANDRA esta muy buena. Tiene muy buenos temas y buenisimos musicos. Los mejores temas lo son ""Hoja En Blanco"", ""Besos Callejeros"", ""Como Abeja Al Panal"", ""Pasion"" y ""Para Decir Adios"" pero todos los temas son buenos. Lo unico que no me gusto de este disco es que la calidad de la grabacion en vivo no fue la mejor y que al momento de pasarlo a un CD se debieron de correjir algunas cosas de la grabacion, pero vale la pena tener este CD. Monchy & Alexandra son excelentes y tienen muchisimo talento. Mucho exito y saludos desde Puerto Rico!"
4,One Song Makes it all Worthwhile but the Others are Nice Too,"This is a good effort. Tony Bennett sings in a swinging jazz style and does a great job of it. Some of the recordings are studio quality and others are recorded live. All are first rate. One song, though, sets this album apart. ""Solitude"" will grip even the most jaded heart. After hearing that one, the rest were superfluous. They were good, however."
5,Love Tony Bennett,Fantastic CD - never tire of listening to great music - this CD does not disappoint. Tony Bennett is timeless.
2,Biased,"It started well, but after some pages Strathern starts to mix very reduced information about Marx's thought with personal attacks and tu quoque (hypocrisy) appeals. Worst, the attacks consist of irrelevant information about intimate details of Marx's life that may be inaccurate or mere gossips. Sure, it is perfectly right to include biographical data in a book like this one, but it is dishonest and false to use this data only to disqualify thoughts and theories.It is very clear that the author is severely biased against this social thinker. It contains some interesting information, though. If you read this book, you should look also for a counterpart from a serious scholar."
3,Good but there are better Furs recordings out there,"By all means buy this album if you like the furs you wont be unhappy, however this is possibly the most ordinary of all their recordings seemingly aimed for the mainstream rather than producing the individuality and class their earlier and later works have.Still on the bright side Richard Butlers voice always shines through."
2,Poor effort from a great band,"This is the worst Furs album -- everything else they ever did (and including the 2 albums by Love Spit Love) was fantastic.To me, it feels like a tired effort -- an attempt to milk the late 80s glam image of the Furs' when they no longer had the heart for it.It also alienated a lot of their original fans, so that the critics unfairly panned the Furs 2 great albums that came afterward in the 90s, as well as the 2 great Love Spit Love albums.If you like top 40 with a slight alternative edge, you might like this. But if you really want to know what the Furs were all about, start with a different album, and add this one only when you feel you've got to have them all..."
2,The only disappointment from this amazing band...,"Unlike most bands that end on a bad note, The Furs fortunately hit their bad note, this album, slightly more towards the center of their career. They then recovered from this pop-crap to end with two more awesome albums, Book of Days, and World Outside.I'd say buy every album except this one. I only give Midnight to Midnight 2 full stars because of Heartbreak Beat."
1,Silex talks a Good Game,"From the product description this sounds like the holy grail. My USB bus is overloaded so I thought I would defer some of that load onto this. So I forked over the 2 hundy. After a week of trying to get the $*&*% to work, I returned it. The instructions were not simple, but pretty convoluted, and I am a geek! It refused to be recognized by the network and the device refused to even reset according to the instructions. And the instructions kept making sure I knew I was the idiot screwing up the process. The support was not toll-free and only during business hours. The online knowledge base was non-existant. So I refused to be abused for 200 any longer, that was more than I paid for my frickin top of the line Wireless N router that works easily and perfectly. No more Silex ANYTHING for me. I am buying an HP print server for my HP printer because they just plain work. I will look into other solutions for my scanner."
3,exciting harmonies,"Among the men's ""quartets"" I find them among the most interesting, however. If you like the Soul Stirrers and the Dixie Hummingbirds, you will probably like this one. I am anxious to compare one of the tracks to the same song recorded by the Fairfield Four. I find the Chosen's harmonies a bit more adventuresome and the overall style somewhat more relaxed, even raw, than the aforementioned groups. Maybe three songs on this album are sub-standard in recording quality and are therefore painful to listen to. Which is really too bad because they are excellent. They should have been cleaned up more before being released on CD. Unfortunately the Chosen did not record very much music, but what is here is excellent."
5,Essential resource,This is the essential resource for a summary evaluation of research and emerging measures for emotional intelligence. Anyone with an interest in this fundamental human capacity should consult this book.
4,Very solid book on how to advertise correctly,"Great book for people in advertising. If your job is to create advertising, or manage people who do, this book will be valuable to you."
4,Excellent Reference but Kinda Wordy.,"This is a must have book if your going for Certification. However, If you just want to learn how to work the different components I would recommend ""Cisco Secure Internet Security Solutions"" CSISS is not as wordy as this and gets into the nuts and bolts of the components.MCNS is excellent for those who may normally tend to ask more questions in class, or may have a little trouble understanding the theory behind the components.These two books go Hand-in-Hand to give you not only the certification but the know how to use the Cisco Secure Components."
3,Most errors ever published in a book,"They should contact Guinness on this one. Almost every page has some type of error. (Mislabeled IP addresses, mistyped configs, etc.) It's amazing! Seriously though, the content in the book is good. However, the number of errors is bad. If there weren't any errors, I would have given it a 5."
3,Good Book but mistakes make it a difficult read,"This book has good coverage of all cisco security technologies. PIXes are there with intense detail but no config examples with access-lists at all. All examples use conduit and static. I wont blame it as this book is published in Jan 2001 and pix access-lists became famous around the beginning of this year. The biggest problem is config mistakes, i wasted hours to figure them out and finally decided that they r definitely wrong. So read it but watch out for mistakes. 3 stars becoz of this"
4,Excelent Book,"It doesn't get five starts because it lacks information about Intrusion Detection, which is an important part of Network Security. The rest of the book is excellent, not only for the CSS1 & CCIP certification (it can be a guide for the 640-442 MCNS, 9E0-571 CSPFA & 9E0-570 CSVPN (you need additional info on the VPN 3000 and the CS VPN Client for this exam)) but also as a reference book for implementing security on Cisco Networks."
1,Law & The Mental Health System - A Review,"Good coveage of the caselaw when it was published in 1998, but much has happened in the mental health area of law since then. The clinical studies and theories were hopelessly outdated when the text was published, and are today so dated as to do a disservice to the reader. Until this text is updated, especially in the clincal areas, I cannot recommend it."
2,False Description,The binding is already falling apart- very poor condition and was not described this way in the description
2,Not what I paid for,I ordered this ring because it said it was Comfort Fit - but it definitely is NOT.
3,Where is Santa Fe? No 5.1 Transfer,"One of the most anticipated video-to-dvd transfers has to be the Juan Gabriel/Rocio Durcal concert, which was filmed in 1997 during their one-stop in Jalisco. Although many rumors have been passed around over the cancelation of the tour, at least you have this lipsync version. In this 16 track concert, you have to hand it to the spectacle the directors put; flashing colored lights, dancers, and mariachi. When first aired on television, the song ""Que Bonito Es Santa Fe"" was sung. Unfortunately it is not included in this dvd version. In regards to sound, you have two choices: Stereo or Surround. No extra features included. Music: B+ Sound: D"
4,Missing one song-Falta una cancion!!!,Try to get the VHS version of this. The song Que Bonito Es Santa Fe is missing on DVD!!!!! But can be found on tape!
4,Dos de los grandes génios de la música juntos...otra vez!!!,"Es un placer ver y escuchar a estos dos artistas con tantisimo talento...es espectaculo,color,luz,sonido y el maravilloso teatro le da al DVD un valor maravilloso.la única pega es el play-back(hasta cuando la discográfica va a seguir siendo tan cutre con sus mejores artistas?).Es una pena porque ver y oir en directo a la Dúrcal cantar Me Refugié en Tu Juventud por ejemplo...no tendria precio.Pero la discográfica sigue sin oir porque es prepotente y no deben de saber que juntando a estos 2 artistas juntos suman 100 millones de discos vendidos con esta discografica.Un 10 para ellos dos y un 0 enorme para la casa de discos mas cutre del mundo(dimitan por favor!!!)"
2,In complete agreement with other reviewer.,"Whoa -- are some of these Gnomon DVDs bad! This guy does not explain the first thing about how he has arranged his layers in Photoshop, the kinds of brushes he is using, or much else. Instead, you basically watch him strut his stuff, skillfully laying down colors and through mysterious methods making it all sort of work. I thought some other Gnomon DVDs were bad (alternately too detailed and then not detailed enough) but this takes the cake. $59.00 should get you a teacher who can really help out."
2,Great if you have experience..,This is not the greatest dvd that I have seen. It is very loose and general in my opinion and does not explain the information well (especially for a beginner). The projects were increased in speed and I think this is also a negative for a beginner. It would have been good to have fewer projects with solid explanations of what was happening throughout the project. Some of it was clear but overall not the best place for a beginner.
2,Don't buy this book - Another is better!!!!,"If you are interested in learning Sonar or Sonar2, the books by Scott Garrigus are better (see below).This ""Quick Start"" book can be completed in 1.5 hours. Even though this book comes with a CD (containing some tutorial files), I was very disappointed. While the instructions were clear, I didn't feel I learned enough to justify the ...cost. This book has 48 pages (really big print).The books I recommend as an alternative are:- ""Sonar Power"" by Scott R. Garrigus- ""Sonar2 Power"" by Scott R. GarrigusI have the Sonar Power book..."
4,Good,I received the book in just a few day and that was a plus. The class I needed it for started the day after I received the book.
1,Fraud,"Amazing how all the reviews speak breathlessly about Mr. Siluk's work, yet are in the same poorly written, grammatical error strewn manner that he writes. And they all come from his hometown of St. Paul, nonetheless!Do you think the self-published, childish work of Mr. Siluk *really garners the attention of world leaders and the Pulitzer Prize committee? If we all lived in a fantasy world, I suppose it would."
3,Better than nothing,"The 1.7 size is decent-more than plenty, especially if your not sure about the product. I personally think two sprays is perfect, anything more could come off as too strong. When I first received the product I sprayed on my wrists and one over my uniform, I could definitely smell it. It's sweet but on the verge of being strong, I like it. I rated a 3, but 3 1/2 would be perfect. I'm deployed and I wanted something light, this will do for now, I probably will not repurchase though. My favorite perfume is Nina Ricci's, this doesn't compare, but it was terrific for the price, size and nice to try something new."
5,smiley face cross stitch,this is a perfect addition to my smiley face collection. i cant cross stitch so i bought this for a friend to cross stitch for me :)
1,Didn't work,I needed these to only hold up sheer tiny sleeves. They fell after 2 minutes. May as well use scotch tape.
1,HATE IT,"So I was looking for a non-expensive way to wear my gown for my mother's company party and thought of these ""fashion tapes"" to help pin up the dress! My bust isn't very big, so I couldn't fill in my dress all the way and went to these, BUT it didn't help me at all! It just left a big red mark on my chest and my gown slipping down me all night."
5,saved the day!,"I am so glad I bought this to hold up a strapless bridesmaid dress. It worked great to hold my dress onto my bra. I was worry free while dancing during the reception!I did not try it against my skin, so I cannot comment on that."
5,The best continuum mechanics text ever written,"This is the best continuum mechanics introductory textbook one will ever find in many years to come. Most of the writers in continuum mechanics write with their feet. But Malvern write with his brain and patient. His concise, vivid explaination make one really appreciate what continuum mechanics is"
2,Book pages and cover of bad quality,"I'm a little disappointed with the book finish quality. The text is excellent but the book pages and cover are of low quality. It seems that I received a ""false"" photocopy. Also, the book paperback and first pages are twisted. As the book does not stay opened in no page, I need to put something above or hold open with my hands."
5,great kids video,Great kids video. Our son is fascinated by airplanes and this video is perfect for him. He loved the music and the airplanes. Wish I could buy more of these!
3,Poems,The poems just were not right for what I was looking for. Other people may have enjoyed them though. Well written.
2,Much ado about Murder,Not as good as the other books in the series. Almost like the author (Simon Hawke) had run out of ideas.
4,"Perverted & Demented, But Still an Eye Opener","By the time i was at the end of the book all the drug use, bondage and mental decay was almost meaningless. It desensitized me so much to it, that i would almost recommend it to anyone, but that would be wrong because i figure that most people would be horribly offended by it and they would continue to believe that he is an evil person. I recommend this to all Manson fans, but others, be wary. The rumor clarifications at the end of the book helped a lot, but i wish he had said more about it."
5,AWESOME,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. THERE WAS A LOT OF STUFF IN THE BOOK THAT I NEVER KNEW ABOUT MANSON. FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT HE ALMOST DIED A COUPLE OF TIMES FROM DRUG OVERDOSES. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF MANSON,OR WHO DOESN'T LIKE MANSON TO READ THE BOOK. IF YOU LIKE MANSON YOU WILL LOVE THE BOOK. IF YOU ARE AGAINST MANSON, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS THE WAY HE IS."
4,Its the best book i've read,"This book is an eye opener to all people, fans or not. This book gives you a compelling look into Brian's younger life, from shooting rabbits and playing with his cousin to his grandfathers basement and getting crabs. This book goes highly recommended to whoever would like to read it. I have read it four times and it still fasinates me. This is a book everyone should own."
4,Manson stands up for human individuality.,"I had to pick an autobiography for one of my college classes. It had to be an autobiography where a person stuggles between their celebrity image and their personal image. I think Manson does just that. The reading was fairly easy and it was thought provoking. It made me think about issues such as religion, mob behavior, the seperation of church and state, the effects of drug use, small town beliefs, and individuality. The only things I would change about this book are: I would add more stories about his childhood and add more about his search for his own identity. I would recommened this book to anyone who believes that every person is an individual."
5,In The NightSide E*C*L*I*P*S*E,"This book has left a hallowing impact on me and has shown me what a beautiful person Marilyn Manson truly is. He is one of the most inspiring people on this earth and one of the most honest musicians. He is not intimidated by the realism of his own thoughts and opinions, and states what he thinks in all forms manageable. I admire him for this undiminishing raw spirit and the way in which he is able to present himself. This book is definately one of the best books i have ever read, philosophically as well as an autobiography. It is a power that he has to create art and beauty out of his own personal darkness, and this is something I aspire to accomplish as well. Thus he has been an enormous inspiration to me and will undoubtably leave a deep slashmark on the world...... I love Marilyn Manson..."
4,"Marilyn's Just This Guy, You Know?",Look. Manson is obviously a liar and exaggerator and in love with himself - but he sure is a lot of fun! I haven't laughed so hard out loud for a long time! Thanks Marilyn
5,Great insight!,"Marilyn Manson is undoubtedly one of the most controversial rock stars out there. This book offers great insight to one of rock's most misunderstood man. Find out truths you never knew, find out which rumours surrounding him are true and which are not, and as with all biographies, read about how it was like growing up as Marilyn Manson. Great read for fans and non-fans alike. Word of caution though, make sure you have lots of time on your hands- this book is extremely difficult to put down once you pick it up!"
4,explict sexual content =0,i bought the book after reading reviews and i am a fan of Manson so i decided to order it. i was really surprised at how he views sexuality. and how important sex and girls where to him growing up. its not what i expected. my mom saw the book and i got really embarrassed! but its an interesting read. im only half way through.
2,The Freak of the Century,"Marilyn Manson could not get an worse. I only read this book to see why Marilyn Manson is the way he is and I got all my answers. I mean it was like reading a Stephen King novel. Just one creeping book that haunts you at night. I heard that Marilyn was going to kill himself like 5 halloween nights ago but unfortunately, NO. I bet he likes being called the freak of the century though. And writing this review doesn't help because all you pot smoking Marilyn Manson fans can't read anyway. I mean, jeez, whiping his bum-bum with the American Flag? Ripping apart puppies on stage? What's America come too?"
1,When will people open there eyes?,"Well he is right about one thing, people are still hating him for the wrong reasons. Most of the people who reviewed this book, dislike him because he misrepresented Satanism, or because his real life isn't as demented as his image, or he isn't as talented a writer/philosopher as he was made up to be. WOW! What about the fact that he is making $millions$ for acting stupidly insane on stage and sucking younger and younger children into his insubordinate lifestyle and/or world view? God is an idiot, authorities and law enforcment are just there to stop you from having a good time. Because God and the police know how to have a good time but, they just don't want you to have one. Right?WAKE UP!"
2,What the Christian Right has trying to reach him with and why.,"The Christian Right does not hate Manson. We Love Manson. We love him so much that we want to share the truth of the Gospel with him in the prayer that Our Heavenly Father might bring Manson to Himself through His son Jesus Christ. If Manson would only turn from his sin and repent, see Jesus as the Lord of all things that He is, and believe the Father raised Him from the dead then he would understand the love we have for him brought about by our love for Christ."
4,Nice and strange. a cocktail of weirdness,"Well some nice background stories and some nice things he has done in his life...and what happened around him. That's what you get!You get to read about a part of his life....the beginning, the tours...the drugs and women. If you like Marylin Manson I suggest you buy it, yet if you don't like him...leave it in the shops. This is about him...and him and his friends only!"
2,I'm not impressed... sorry,"Ok, I am a fan of what I have heard of Manson's music (I have ""Antichrist Superstar"" and ""Mechanical Animals""),but his book simply left me bored and unmoved. He is intelegent, but not THAT intelegent. Some of his ideas and beliefs are good,but simple. I truly expected more. One phraze that kept popping in my head throughout the book was ""yeah right!"" His description of his life is just too over the top. Until I began reading the book I truly did not think he was a fabrication,but I now have to wonder. Don't waste your time or brain cells on this book, stick with decyphering the social commentary he puts in some of his songs (the ones that aren't strickly commercial)."
4,---,"I felt this book was very good indeed. however, i feel that it focused more on mansons private life, rather than his music. having said this his private life is very interesting and at times quite funny...overall a good read - buy it."
5,The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell,"I started reading this book expecting it to be a fairly brief description of the life of Brian Warner/Marilyn Manson, but I was very pleasantly surprised when great details about his thinking, and life experiences were brought out in the first couple chapters. I had never realized some of the motives behind his music, and why he had such a horrible reputation at venues for his performances. After reading this book I find him to be a much more interesting individual, and it almost frightens me how much of a genius he is. There are elaborate reasons for everything he does in his shows, and for the lyrics in his songs. People took things out of context, or didn't understand them when he was at his prime, and thus gave him a really bad reputation that has carried over to what people think about him today. Read the book and you will understand what I mean."
4,Enlightening and grotesque.,"Marilyn Manson is an artist. Visually as well as poetically. He writes and intrigues while he shocks you with unbelievable stories of sex,drugs, and rock and roll. He brings about valid questions regarding society and the norms ""we"" choose to live by, albeit hypocritical as they may be. He is the product of a genius and a madman, who found his voice in artistic expression. I do not agree with most things he does.....but he makes me think."
2,F*** Neil Strauss and his bullshit hack approach to human life,"I liked most of the man behind this book. I enjoyed the unfettered romp around the US in a drug filled frenzy, but it was hard to get past the shadow writer Neil Strauss who also wrote ""The Game"" and several articles for Rolling Stone. Seriously, F*** that guy! He writes for 8th graders. Target audience. And do you know what? He succeeds at what he does because people don't want originality, depth or intelligence.I'd like to try my hand at a Marilyn Manson Biography with an older and more disillusioned Mr. Manson and really make some people uneasy. Cut a bit deeper and bring out a more refined hatred for existence. Perhaps someday..."
3,Mediocre,"As a fan, I am disappointed in this shallow account of MM's story. Manson is an intelligent, insightful, and creative individual, but that does not come through at all in the book. While he does occasionally share fleeting moments of insight, it's mostly the same old rock-star whining: I had a messed up childhood, my record label screwed me, I did way too many drugs, I had lots of weird sex. Skip this book if you're looking to connect with the more intelligent and pensive side of MM. If you're looking for gross-out stories of self-destruction with only cursory glimpses of insight, have at it."
3,Don't believe this is all true.,"It's a entertaining book but I must say I think Manson is full of himself and alot of this book seems like bull. Maybe it's not, I know Manson is a pretty weird guy so it could be true. The book also seems to jump around to much. Overall it was good but I take everything he wrote with a grain of salt."
2,I can get better soft porn out of Penthouse Letters,"An exercise in literary depravity. That is what the title should read. I enjoy Marilyn Manson's music, and the sanitized articles that I have read in many periodicals left me curious about what really goes on behind those fake eyes. I was looking forward to something that I didn't get, however, after I read page after page of disgusting sex stories about Mr. Manson. I'm not judging his lifestyle, I'm just saying that I am not in the least interested in anyone's sex life in that minute of detail. It went on and on, too, about the bizarre sex on stage, sex behind the stage, sex in hotels, sex on the road, sex, sex, sex. I put it down halfway through because I was picturing a naked Marilyn Manson having sex. Quite revolting. Do not buy unless you like reading poorly written smut in the first person."
5,explains most lyrics. Can change anyone's view of Marilyn,Awesome book. It explains alot about his life and I can now see where most of his lyrics came from. He is so real. This book gave me a deeper respect for Marilyn. I love him!
4,"Great History, For Steel-Stomached Readers","When I read this book, I thought that Marilyn was the greatest gift to music and to the world today. I guess that the image put false pretenses into my mind. I found out that he is actually a nervous, witty, complacent, determined, and most of all experienced HUMAN BEING. He knows the ways of humanity both pleasant and not so bright. I found the vivid descriptions of what lurked in his randfather's cellar interesting, albeit somewhat discomforting. I still love Marilyn's music, and now have respect for him as a person, not as an icon. I recommend this book to both fans and 'antiMansonites' alike. It will give you a better understanding of what Marilyn Manson is all about, and his day-to-day life. Great Rumor clarifyer.."
5,CREEPY SKIN CRAWLING BOOK: FASCINATING,"A deep twisted book that goes farther into the human brain than ever thought possible, Marilyn Manson speaks openly about his life: sex, drugs, accusations, goth, and all those other contraversial objectives that make this man more notorious than Kenneth Starr. With large lavish glossy color photos, not only will you see him materially, but internally also."
5,"Do not judge a book by its cover, literally!","I remember the day I saw Marilyn Manson and heard his music. I then remember how disgusted I was with him. Yet, I am not one to judge people just by the glance I take of them. I investigated him and finally got a hold of this book. Instantly, all I hoped for was proven, as I learned that none of the ill-fated rumors surrounding him were true. He is now my favorite performer and my most respected. All of you who believe he is anything devilish or disgusting must read this; I challenge you to explore him and discover his honesty and trueness. There is nothing bad about his message, for he is only warning us of the things that he wishes us not to be."
5,Thanks!,Great price and quick service. Just the way you'd want a transaction to happen. Wonderful job!
4,I learned more about Marilyn Manson,"I really wish that I had read this book sooner. It seems so out of date now; I wonder what he is up to now. It was an interesting read; I don't really know what he was trying to tell us or not tell us through the book. Just seemed like any other kid that wanted to be a rockstar, and when he actually made it, kept up the stereotype of one. Well written, it was a quick read for me."
1,I expected so much more.,"This book was awful. I thought that there would be more insight into Marilyn Manson the performance artist, rather than page after page of his drug induced disgusting sexual sadistic escapades. So he grew up with a strict christian upbringing. Big Deal. So his grandfather had hidden porography. So What. The story never gets any deeper than that.I can't even tell you when or why he started a band, or how he even found out that he had an acceptable singing voice. If it's there, I didn't see it.I'm not one to be easily turned off by rock-star decadence, but some of these incidents bordered on such a level of sadism that I was apalled that these situations were even put into print.Total garbage, and a waste of my time."
2,Absolutly Disgusting,"I bought thid book because I absolutly loved Manson! Some other people said that it was sick, but I didn't listen to that, because I loved him so much, and thought they knew s**t. If you are a big Manson fan, and are saying that too, beleive me on this one! If you like to read about Manson picking off bugs from his d**k, grandpa's masterbating, losing virginity, and other sick sex, well this is for you. If you're a big Manson fan like I am, just stick to the CD's. Trust me on this one, and you'll be glad.I still like him, but not this book. Oh, one more sick thing. Marilyn and Twiggy, (by the way I think Twiggy is the hottest guy on this Earth!) are left deserted, both naked in cold snow. They dig up dead bones, and bring them on the tour with them. This book did however have a couple of good points about his tragic childhood. Stick to Manson's Cd's this time! Twiggy is soooooo hot!!!"
3,Decent,"Yeah, let's face it, this had the makings of a great tell all book, but it was written very, very badly. For a man who assures of his intelligence, it doesn't show throw his literature. The quality of writing goes beyond trying to identify with the audience, it numbs the reader. However, he does lead an interesting life so it was worth the effort."
5,Thumbs up,This book tells a lot about Marilyn Manson and his life growing up and his family. I read this book quite a few years ago and I can't believe noone has reviewed it yet. Great book and even some good pictures.
4,"Great Story,too early in his career","I've read Dave Mustaine's book as well as Slash's, and this book far surpasses theirs. Much more shocking, blasphemous, and philosophical. Manson cleared up common rumors and misconceptions which was great because now we all know the truth. The only complaint I have is that it was written way too early in his career, having only released 2 studio albums and 1 EP. I wish he would have held back so we could have read the behind-the-scenes of Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood. Other than that, great book, thoroughly informative and interesting."
3,an interesting kind of boring,"Interesting bio, but the time line bounces around it seems like a lot of work to keep track of. Overall ok book though."
4,Honesty of the outcast.,"This book was a reread for me as I purchased and read it the first time when it was initially released. The second time was even more enjoyable.I am a fan of Manson's, with my favorite song being wormboy.I do not however claim to agree with everything he says or does, and I do not wear black lipstick or anything his fans tend to get stereotyped as. With that in mind, I have to say this is one of the most well written and entertaining books I have ever read. Manson's ability to tell his life story is admirable. He creates rapport with the reader from the beginning and never uses his ego to relate his situations, but honest and humble language. His book allows you to focus on why rather than the extreme what. Loved it!!!!!"
4,Does not disappoint,"This is the second time I have read this book. I am hardly a Manson fan having heard no more than sweet dreams and the beautiful people, but I find this book fascinating. Marilyn Manson is horribly misunderstood. I don't entirely agree with some of his opinions or actions, but this book is well written. He is actually a very intelligent human being."
4,Manson is quite the devil,"And a self-centered ass. But what an engrossing tale. Quick read, interesting stories... some not for the weak of heart. Must read for fans. Now I need the sequel from an older Manson."
3,The Long Hard Road Out of... Hell?,"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell reveals that Marilyn Manson is not a product of his environment. Everything that you believe about him is the result of a carefully calculated plan to become the world's most shocking musical and visual artist.He succeeds in repulsing readers with stories of drugs, fetishism and violence - but tries too hard to convince his audience that he's demented. Unfortunately for him, there's nothing scary about that.On the plus side, this book dispels rumors and gives fans insight into his motivations. It's not a great rock autobiography, but it's not bad either."
4,A Journey to the heart of Manson,I have never been a big fan of Marilyn but I was interested in his work and about him. This book helps you understand who he is and why he is such a shock to our society. Even if your not a fan of Marilyn i recommend you reading it.
5,"a riveting, can't-put-it-down account of Manson's life","As a fan of Marilyn Manson, I was anxious to get my hands on this book--well, I finally did on 10/12, and I read every word in less than two hours! I devoured this book like a hungry cannibal in a graveyard! I agree with other reviewers who have said that everyone, no matter if they are a fan or not, should read this book. It is fascinating and it gives great insight into Manson's life and times and perhaps explains accurately how and why he has become who he is today. Hail Marilyn!"
4,"Some disturbing parts, but otherwise very good read!","I have enjoyed Manson's music since I first heard about him during the controversial release of Antichrist Superstar, so I was intrigued to read his book. He does a good job clearing up facts about his life & childhood, and while some of his tour stories can be shocking & disturbing (although maybe not as much for true Manson fans), his story is still enjoyable & very real to life."
4,Great read,"I've been a fan since the 90's, and this book is a great look into what made Manson who he is."
5,A DEMAND FOR MANSON FREAKS!!!,"Being a Manson fan myself i found the book to be fascinating. At times I was disgusted, very much ammused, surprised, and delighted to find just how genius he is. Not all my opinions are the same as his, just like all fans, but everyone should give him and his book a try because you just might be able to relate to his point of view."
4,What was God Thinking!!!!!!,"The book it self is not that well written, I think that Marilyn could have done better by him self. However it is very insightful behind the mind of this psychotic genius, and all the crazy things that he's done that most people might not know.It provides ample room for dicussion. Like all that Manson does, it is of course not for the sqeemish."
3,an inside look at the nations biggest satanist,"When i read this book I was thinking of the hell brian went through as a child. From his mothers drug abuse to pornography to having vermin running free in his home. Although it was written well, and in great detail, I find that it is nothing more than just Mr. Manson bragging on himself. There for I think that it was just another way of hyping his fame( or trying to gain more of it)."
1,Most Feared and Revered Superstar in the Country?,"""from the pit of despair to the top of the charts, and recounts his metamorphosis from a frightened Christian schoolboy into the most feared and revered music superstar in the country. Along the way, you'll hear what happens to fans--and celebrities--who dare to venture backstage with the one of the world's most dangerous rock stars.""who wrote this review, Manson himself? Hardly the most revered rock star in the country. Hardly one of the world's most dangerous rock stars. This self-adoring review is enough to keep me from spending any money on this."
2,Manson-fascinating guy? judging by this book nay,"This book was nothing more then a bunch of bullsh*t. Manson is constantly trying to make some kind of extremely philosophically profound writings and eulogies. This book was fairly well written but its message is nill however its slick enough to satisfy the simple and childish minds of his teen followers. Personally I think his songs are not bad but his image and attitude is overdone. He's not a musician anymore, just a sellout buisnessman. He's also giving bad name to real goth and goth get blamed for stupid things that mansonites do. Manson says god is dead but he sympathisez satan. It isn't any smarter not to believe in god and worship satan. So if you wont a book of slick quotes, record sellin' image creatin' fake creativity and a bunch of statements that don't make sence that gets your pondering check out this book. Or better yet go read some classics or something. Atleast those authors know what they're talking about."
2,this obviously will be misunderstood and overanalyzed.,"his detractors and disciples have already lost the meaning in the message. it was well-written and served its purpose splendidly. as for the posted reviews of the book, i quit reading anything above 3 stars; i wanted to focus on the detractors. sadly, they were no different than the disciples, they just thought they were. everyone knew what the focus of this book was and reading this book would do nothing to alter a readers perception of that focus.as for my own rating: giving it fewer than 3 stars will draw more attention than a screen full of 5 stars."
4,Good ideas and stories!,It has allot of good ideas. Allot of books start out slow but this one has allot of great stories from Manson's life from beggining to end. I read the whole thing in 3 days! I didn't really have any problems with the book. It was all really good and interesting. It really never slows down.
5,This Book Rules!!!,"This Book is an all time great book! It follows the life of the great creative and talented man of Marilyn Manson! It clears up rumors, questions, and if you hate him, I can guarentee you all have so much more of an understanding of this man after you read this book!!!!!! I give it two thumbs up and HIGHLY recommend this book TO ALL PEOPLE!"
3,"Not a fan, but ok book",This book gives a brief look into the twisted mind of a bad boy. If you like bios like these get it for $3 like I did.
3,disturbing,"good book, but found somewhat disturbing. i did not like the female degradation. Still an interesting read. Good insight into a twisted mind."
4,Most Definitely Very Different,"I am currently finishing up ""The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell"" by (of all people) Marilyn Manson. I only saw it because it was one of the Kindle Daily Deals. And no, I don't listen to his music (I mean, of course I've heard some of it here and there, but who hasn't?).VERY VERY interesting autobiography. What a life. This guy's so freakin' wierd he's actually interesting. But also obviously very intelligent. Anyways... if you wanna try something different that will keep you turning the pages, give it a shot. I don't really know why, but I certainly can't put it down."
2,Long Road out of Cocaine,Manson's book is a self indulgent trip through cocaine addiction. Not too bad. I would like him to write a new book every ten years.
4,Everything you may expect from a Marilyn Manson bio.,"This book was everything I expected from Marilyn Manson: the messy, creepy family, disturbing childhood, an unbridled need for attention.However he is also very articulate and excels at manipulating his image to create controversy (just like other one-name ""singers"").Something tells me that there's quite a bit of embellishment in all the stories about roadies and sundry mayhem. No matter what, I remain very interested in how uncomfortable he makes religious people. Bravo Marilyn -or Brian, or whoever the voices in your head tell you at the moment-!!"
4,Awesome read,"This book provides an inside look at the life of a Rock Superstar. I've been a fan of Marilyn Manson for many years, and this have me insight to his life and how he struggled that I never knew. I could hardly put it down! It's a must read, fan or not!"
5,Good read.,"This book was a really good read. I read it very quickly and though I squirmed through some of it, (I expected that I would) I was mostly just fascinated by it. My only disappointment was that it ended where it did. I wish there was a sequel to this book written in the same storytelling fashion. Maybe someday..."
2,"You're a Haughty One, Saucy Jack.","There's not a whole lot to say about this book that hasn't already been said. If Manson and his ghostwriter were trying to write like Jackie Collins in black leather pants, they succeeded. But judging by Manson's philosophical posturings and the GRIM DARK title, I doubt it.I will say this though: the story of the making of Antichrist Superstar has the potential to be a brilliant black comedy. It's like ""This is Spinal Tap"" meets ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" with Manson himself as a black-clad Ignatius J. Reilly. Unfortunately, that would probably require more self-awareness than he seems capable of."
5,Wow! Well written and intriguing. I couldn't put it down!,"I'm a huge fan of Manson, and this book made me appreciate him even more. You won't regret it, and the price is right as well."
5,Wow this book was good,This became one of my favorite books I have ever read. THe story not only intrigued me but was very well written. I couldn't put the book down from the time I began reading it. I went back many times to re-read sertain parts. Many things that the band did were amazing but to see how Manson came out of the situation was kind of inspirational. I have new respect to him and will never forget this book. It was such a great read.
5,"Man or monster, you gotta love him","I can't stand here and tell you whether or not Manson is a writer of integrity, a strong person, an intelligent person, or a person of morals and philosophies. My personal opinion is that he is all of these things. But the book held me enthralled for so many different reasons. The most enthralling moment of all was the chapter on the creation of ""Antichrist Superstar,"" an amazing chronicle of how a disturbed man retreated into his past (and to the beginning of his book) to escape the wretched whirlpool of his life, faced terrors about himself that had afflicted him for years, and come out stronger and refreshed, like the Antichrist Superstar described in the album (which, incidentally, meant so much more to me after reading this segment). His section on ""The Rules"" is a welcolme amusement that never fails to crack me up. I was truly touched by his story."
4,"Honest, Smart, N'Sexy","I really loved this book. It kept my attention because it's easy to read and you can't wait to find out what happens next.He is very open about his childhood and other Manson Questions everyone is dying to know. Not to mention his writings, pics,and magazine interviews as well. I gave it four stars because I thought he could have benn a little more in depth about the rest of the band."
5,End the lies and confusion of Marilyn Manson,"Ever since people reconized Marilyn Manson, people have created many lies and confusion about Marilyn Manson (a.k.a. Brian Warner). This book tells, from the man's own point of view, about his life as a child and what he has become to be.Brian Warner went to a Christian school as a child. He always tried to fit in, but the kids always rejected him. He tells about the life he had as a child.After working in the band for a while, he started to become noticed. When he came out with ""Anti-Christ Superstar"" in 1996, that is when most of the lies and confusion started. Many rumors about him started, which were untrue.If you are a Manson fan or not, you should read this book. It will tell you about what he is, and most importantly, what he isn't."
3,Purchased for my teenage son,It's actually a pretty good read which was surprising to me. My son could identify with the childhood that M.M. had and realized that the adversity and difficulties that he himself has faced and faces makes him who he is and makes him stronger and that he could use this strength to become something great. I personally don't care for a lot of M.M.'s shocking ways but I do admire his intelligence because he knows what it takes to stand out in the crowded music industry and sell sell sell... smart business man. Good book - My son is 17 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than that because of the material.
3,Mr. Pseudo Goth,"I thought this book would be interesting in a ""shock rock"" sort of way but Manson's negative slant on the world comes across as unrealistic and whiney in it's excess. One interesting note though: He admits it's all an act. He calls it ""performance art."" He's trying to wake people up to all the bad in the world. Yeah, like most people don't realize there is too much bad stuff in the world. It's amazing how much you can get away with when you wear one blue contact lens."
1,Didn't like this book,"I could not even force myself to finish this book. I like some of his music and am fascinated by his video's, but just couldn't stomach the book."
1,waste of time,i am a big fan of his music but this book shows a differnt side he is nothing but a bully and a losser if any of the stories are actuly true that is but one thing i do know is he drinks alot of his own bath water nothing like being your own biggest fan
1,Not that good of a read,"He doesnt really answer all of the accusations made against hi, if anything it leaves more questions than answers. However it does provide an inside to some of the obstacles he faced with drugs, and alcohol."
2,The finest example of formalism I have ever seen...,"The packaging is excellent, dazzling, but artfully chosen...An informative read, but falls miserable steps short of genius...Its tenuity easily unfolds to an observant eye...Visible lack of nuance...No extraordinary display of subtlety... Entertaining throughout, however...Chock-full of disturbing musings, and articulate, dotty reminiscing...His previously lyrical trademark of cryptic imagery and metaphor abound here as well, and are fittingly egocentric... Conclusion: With its emphasis on the art department once again, Manson becomes our favorite Thespian. Dangerously charismatic, he is an arrow of dry wit -- unsheathed, and ready to strike. Yet his aim remains pitiably poor. This is no Beelzebub, folks. Simply raffish, teenage hearthrob. The book is a misnomer, and I suggest Memoirs of a Megalomaniac. CChaxes"
5,"vile, true, dirty.....I LOVE IT!!!!!","This is an absolute wonderful book. It's one of those books your can't put down, just wonderful. You do not (as many people dont know) need to be a Manson fan to read this or even to enjoy it. It tells you some of his most private details of his life, and in such great wording.The reason why people would not [like] this book, is because they are judgemental, people look at Manson and assume hes a stupid rocker, they judge him by his image, which is wrong. He is one of the few artists that actually have something to say, and isnt afraid to say it.But back to the book: words cant describe how awesome it is, it tells the story of his chilhood, his fight against [certain] people, how he overcame it and his triumphs. And it comes with some very cool color photos. So i highly encourage ANYONE to buy this book, its art."
2,It Was Okay...,"This was an okay book about MM's life, childhood, and goth depravity... but just okay. As far as being a ""how-low-can-you-go"" type of book, David Crosby's bio ""Long Time Gone"", and John Phillips' ""Papa John"" bio were both light years better. Give either of those 2 a try before giving this one five stars."
2,A Short Quick Read into Hell,"Worth a browse in some mall bookstore, readable for about as long as it is comfortable to stand with a book in one's hand. I will admit to one real laugh that almost made the cappucino foam burst my eustachian tubes. The pics are pretty artsy. But the horrible stories of boring experiments of depravity on handicapped groupies was really too much. Not even so much as a tinge of regret evident, either. I wonder when or if he is ever going to wake up to the existential nausea of his own existence, instead of merely reacting to the banality of post-modernism. And how about more details of his granddad's basement hobbies, eh? Anyway, might be worth buying a copy just to have to take to Vegas sometime when Manson is in his 50's and playing some off-strip lounge act, you can get him to sign it."
5,"Must read for a true fan, covers past, present, and rumors.","This book explains almost anything you ever wanted to know about the controversal man in the media, Marilyn Manson. From his childhood up until the end of his Anti-Christ Superstar tour this book doesn't hold anthing back. Lastly you'll finally find out if he was a part of the Wonder Years cast or not..."
5,"I'm not such a great fan of his music, but I liked his book","I don't read that many books, (I read too many mangas and comics...), but I just one day decided to read this book. I only owned 2 of his cds (Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals) and I didn't listen to them that much, but I just thought I'd read the book simply out of curiosity. Once I started reading, I was kinda disgusted by the first chapter but it got me interested in this guy's, some-what messed up, life. I acctually just finished reading the book a few days ago and I liked it all the way through. You don't have to be a big M.Manson fan to read the book...just be somewhat curious about it and give it a try. I did and ended up really liking this book."
2,Self-Absorbed Drivel,"Followed the band over the Nine Inch Nails period so I bought the book for some light reading.I read to the end hoping that it would lead to his seeing that he was taking himself too seriously but he just never does. This is a boring, repetitive account of someone's self-absorbed, destructive adventures at the expense of other people. There are a couple of amusing parts (like his lists) but really he is trying to make a book out of nothing.Like every ""deep teenager"" he seems to think he is the only person to endure rough times or question anything. Luckily, most ""deep teenagers"" eventually open their eyes, suck it up, move on to adjust to a reasonable approximation of the life they want in the context of the world they live in.Perhaps some of his self-loathing is a fair judgment. He is proud of all the wrong things. This book is a yawn. I feel intellectually worse off for having read it."
3,Certifiably crazy.,Interesting background about Marilyn Manson - from bis early beginning. Read it with an open mind and remind yourself that it's entertainment
3,I didn't think it was all that good...,"I'm a big fan of Manson's music since last summer. I've been wanting to read his book but while reading it, I realized that most of it is just his experiences with drugs (and how they mess up his thinking, his actions, his feelings, and his experiences with bondage and backstage sexual encounters with fans who are willing to be exploited sexually and who enjoy that kind of thing. I didn't learn a whole lot about him as a person except that he enjoys disgusting sexual acts and snorting coke. I thought that buying the book I would receive a lot of insight into his mind but I was disappointed in that. I felt that his writing this book was just a way to make more money off his fans, and to literally disgust everyone. (Which he certainly did). His music still kicks [bootie] in my mind and I don't hate him just because I didn't like his book."
3,Different,"Not for the faint, but certainly interesting. It gives you some insight with a lot of sadness. The message was clear and deliberate, yet delivered in an unfortunate polarizing style."
4,Great book on Mormon Temples,"My wife and children love this book. They can look up the first 100 Mormon temples, review statistics and stories about that temple, and see a Chad Hawkins painting of that temple."
1,he was wrong,"Today, it came out that Felt was Deep Throat. Seems this guy's sleuthing ability isn't that good...."
3,"A quick and interesting, if not satisfing read.","I found the book interesting but only because I first read All the President's Men. In fact, All the President's Men should be required reading before picking up In Search of Deep Throat. In Search of Deep Throat examines throughly many characters that time and space could not allow in Woodward and Bernstein's book.Mr. Garment concentrates more on those he feels aren't Deep Throat in explaining why he rules them out. It lead me to feel that the time spent on his actual choice cheapened the outcome and didn't seem to satisfy me.What I found most interesting is that his choice as Deep Throat doesn't warrent a single mention in All the President's Men."
4,A great book about a good guess,"The fact that no one has figured out who Deep Throat is, after 27 years of amateur sleuthing, suggests that no definitive evidence exist (remember how quickly the author of ""Primary Colors"" was unmasked? And that was just a novel). Garment doesn't have anything new, but he combines all the clues that exist (there aren't many) and produces a plausible guess. Is he right? I don't know, and I suspect neither does he. But the point of the book is not to find out who Deep Throat is, but to relive the scummy underbelly of Watergate, following the leaks and counterleaks, attempts to unmask and conceal sources, and so on. This is a fun book to read, even if Deep Throat's identity (Garment's guess, unfortunately, is not particularly exciting) remains unknown."
4,Amusing for Watergate fans,"For some reason he devotes a whole chapter to Nixon's rise back to power which in comparison to the other chapters seems somewhat out of place. The highlight of Garment's book is when he recalls Woodward & Bernstein's classic All The President's Men. While he goes through the shortlist of who is suspected of being Deepthroat and disecting the characteristics of DT to the people he actually knew was very interesting to the say the least. But when Garment states that DT might actually be a composite of several people in the administration, I started to lose interest. I still read it twice though. Very Good."
4,Beautiful well made grabbing ring,"Really pleased with this purchase as it is cute, the fabric is soft, and the teething part is a lovely beech wood. My daughter is only newborn so I don't know if she will actually use it, hence 4 stars overall rather than 5. It is only small, around 16.5cm, but so adorable. As per the other reviewer, the colour is deep orange rather than bright red. That is fine with me, as I love orange - but buyer beware."
4,Great fair isles,"This book has incredible Fair Isles patterns that can be adjusted to different sizes. If you use Elizabeth Zimmerman's circular method you can go crazy with this books patterns in any number of shapes and sizes. The book itself has a nice range of designs and sizes for men, women and children. Most are a little shapeless so I recommend tweaking them if you want a less bulky result."
2,this new EA game don't like it.,"i don't like this new version of FIFA. I'm a big fan of EA FIFA games but this one don't like it.The game play is to slow, the players appear to be dummies in the field and the user interface don't like it too.Maybe its the version for the PS2 and maybe for the XBox and xBox360 have a better perfomance.Regards."
1,DontBother,"This is a crappy DVD. Bond spends 45 minutes going over a single Tai Chi move. You spend all of that time and don't know any Tai Chi when you're done. Plus Bond is annoying. Also, when I got my DCD there was a big scratch on it and it didn't work very well.I suggest Scott Cole's DVD (Discover Tai Chi for Beginners). Scott also does the mirror image style that is easy to follow... and you actually get a real work out. You actually learn several moves, step by step. Scott takes you though the moves and then gives you 2 separate routines (a warm up and a work out). Once you get the moves down you can skip straight to the workouts on the menu. There is also an added feature with about 6 extra moves that aren't in his workout. Scott isn't bad looking either, and the scenery is great."
4,A Gift,"Book well received, and well loved!This is for anyone who wantes to read some good positive text!"
1,Garbled and misleading,This is yet another example of a book allegedly by the Dalaia Lama which is in reality nothing more than an interview with him. In this case the interviewer is so muddled in his thinking that he hasn't even understood that Buddhism does not accept the existence of soul.
5,Exhilarating,"Hey People!! ATHUL is a must buy CD!! You just got to have it!! It has everything - lyrics, skits, music...and not to mention excellent instrumental music! This CD will keep you bopping and smiling all the time!! You won't regret getting it!! I haven't! One more thing this Guy rocks!!! ATHUL, my friends and I dig your stuff!! Way To Go!!"
3,OK,"This is an ok kids movie, like the movie Jack type, but the kids are not cute in this one! It stars that Ernest guy. Its an okay movie for like 9 and 10 yr olds."
3,It's OK....,"First, I simply can't agree with those who rate this book as the ""best ever"", etc. It is not. If you're looking for content or some historical perspective of ham radio, forget it. This book is basically a graphical display of QSL cards collected by the author, with sporadic and somewhat disjointed anecdotal stories to go along. It's actually a satisfactory but not great work, with little informational content. Visually it's very good, but the appeal will only be to those interested in seeing a LOT of QSL cards from around the globe, and some light text and a few pictures to go with. Not bad, and on balance I do recommend it, but it's a C+ work."
4,Acer ScanWit 2720S Film Scanner,"If it were not for the poor instructions and missing SCSI terminator, the Acer ScanWit would be outstanding in all respects. One discovers after hours of frustration and a close read of the poorly written (translated) manual that a passive terminator is required, but not included, if this is your first (and only) SCSI device. Also look out for the second ""Press"" on the slide mount. The mount should be drawn all the way into the scanner, with only an inch protruding. Once the terminator is connected and the slides or film mounted, it is a an extremely valuable,easy-to-use piece of equipment."
2,Nice watch...bad band,"This is a great looking watch, but the band will not stay clasped so I cannot even wear it. Invicta does not warrant the band. I am not sure what good a wrist watch is if you cannot wear it."
5,Gr8 quality watch...!,This is a really nice watch. One of the best I had. Any one who likes watches will surely compliment about this watch. It is a bigger than average watch. Overall my satisfaction is 99%.
1,bad investment,"After about two weeks I dropped this watch on the floor from just counter height. For how bulky this watch is, it should handle a simple drop. It hasn't worked right since then. The time adjustment knob (middle knob) frequently gets jammed in to far causing the watch to stop. Also the chronograph timer never sets to zero any more. It sets to 20 seconds as zero. You have to pay $25 plus your postage to send it back to be fixed. There is a reason they get poor marks with the Better Business Bureau."
3,Huge Watch,"This watch would be perfect if it was half the size. When I opened the box I though; "" this is the ugliest and biggest watch I have ever seen."" This watch looked like a Buzz Lightyear gadget or something."
3,The big curved crystal actually is the biggest negative point for the watch,"I bought this watch since it looked very nice on the Internet. Price was great. I had to return this watch since the crystal was curved so much that it reflected light and I could not read the time easily. Also the dial is a bit busy. I would definitely keep this watch if it was not for the extremely curved crystal. In my opinion, crystal hurts this watch overall. I did not like the feel of the Lorica band either. Leather would be better. I wish Invicta would have a little smaller watch with not so curved mineral crystal."
4,Movement stoping,"Love the Watch, great size and great feel. however, i had a problem with the movement stopping after a couple days of 'rest'. i put a new battery in it and it seems to solve the issue. But now i find the movement stopping after a couple weeks, then one week, now just a couple days. anyone else have this problem?"
4,VERY Pleased,"I recently bought this watch looking for something with a little weight, and a nice stylish look. I am very happy with the feel, and style of this watch. At certain angles there is a weird distortion to the face, but nothing too drastic to make the watch difficult. Easy use and simple chronograph make it a very versatile watch, and looks good doing it."
3,Men's Invicta Watch,"I had priced this watch in the mall and it was about $400 so you can imagine my surprise when I found it here for $150. However, I should have known it would be a catch. The watch itself looked cool as if it were authenic. But the band brought about a bit of concern. It is clearly not the actual band that goes with the watch. The real band is a good quality leather and it snaps, not buckles. This made the watch look like a knock-off, but I could tell the timepiece itself was genuine. Be ware and use your discretion when the discount seems a little unrealistic! =)"
5,Learning about modern art,This is a terrific book that fills in the kind of links in Modern art that you might be unaware of. Written beautifully by Robert Hughes...Haven't finished it but I am enjoying it!
2,Not For a Beginner,"This book is very wordy, the author tends to use French and Italian phrases without translation. The book's cryptic explanations and definitions must be tediously read and re-read, since they do not appear to follow any pattern. Hughes is a pretentious attention seeker. This book is not for anyone outside art students."
2,Difficult reading.,"I have read some past reviews on this book, and i am shocked to find that college students have been using this book for learning. I am currently in high school and my teacher is making us read this book. I find this book very hard to understand. If anyone has any information or quick summaries of this book i would appreciate it. Thanks."
2,DONT EVEN ACT LIKE U FAMOUS,EMINEM WILL SLAY ROYCE ANYDAY OF THE WEEK. ROYCE IS LUCKY EM EVEN BROKE HIS ASS IN TO THE BIZ. HE HAS A NICE FLOW BUT HIS MOUTH WILL HAVE HIM KILLED B4 HE DOES ANYTHING. HE AINT GOIN NO WHERE ANYWAYS NOW THAT EMINEM AINT WIT HIM. PROPS TO ALL THE PRODUCERS ON THIS ALBUM THO ROYCE IS A LIL PUNK
5,Great Music,"Contrary to one of the reviewers, the production on this album was top notch. With production by Just Blaze (King of Detroit) Kanye West (Heartbeat) The Alchemist (I Won't Be, Danger) and The Neptunes (Feels Good, Make This Run) you can't complain. The production is great and as always Royce is on point with his flow and his lyrics. It'll be hard to find a better album, but try September 23rd when Royce releases his official sophmore album ""Death is Certain"". To conclude, Build & Destroy is a good buy, actually a must buy."
4,NICE*,"First off, Royce has great wordplay and good lyrics to compare. Second, the beats he was rockin to were subpar. I was feelin it but I don't know if the replay value is as good as his first release. Check it out, its worth the listen."
1,Deceptive cover,"I bought this book when I was looking for speed reading books It turns out that this book is not about speed reading words but people. So if you are looking for a book to practice speed reading skills, keep on looking this is NOT the book. I was quite disappointed. I know I should have read the preface, introduction and all but I didn't. I still think that the cover title promises more than it delivers inside. Just my opinion."
4,Complete & Comprehensive Entries / Scholarly and Readable,"This Dictionary contains all of the necessary entries that it should and even goes beyond what most others do. It is very scholarly but yet very readable. While it is the best that I have come across yet and would reccomend it to anyone that is even considering it, I am still hopeful for THE DICTIONARY and hence in that hope give Elwell a 4 star rating. If you know of THE DICTIONARY, then by all means please contact me. willi775@pilot.msu.edu"
5,Phonetics and Beyond,"Mackay provides chapters on the relationship of phonetics to the study of language including dialectal variation, writing systems, articulatory phonetics for vowels and consonants, speech dynamics, suprasegmentals, phonemics and phonotactics, anatomy and physiology of speech, and speech acoustics and perception. Exercises in phonetic transcription are provided. An excellent introductory text, particularly when anatomy must be combined with phonetics. Useful as the first semester of a two course sequence in teaching speech to individuals with hearing loss."
1,Fragile Plastic Houseing,My Topeak Hexus multi-tool broke in my hand under what I would consider to be a reasonable amount of stress. When it broke the plastic housing snapped and the sharp plastic edges cut my hand. I don not recommend this tool because the plastic is not strong enough. I recommend one with a metal housing. Take a look at the customer image that I uploaded.
5,great multitool,"A great multitool that is compact and light. I keep it in a bag under my seat with a patch kit.The tool has been indispensable for the chain tool, the allen wrenches, and especially the tire levers.If you can get it on sale, it is well worth it and will likely bail you out of trouble sometime in the future"
1,Multi-function tool that often fails to function,"The tool looks good out of the packaging and has a decent heft. I was initially pleased.First inner-tube change, snap goes one of the flimsy tire levers (see the image I uploaded). Disappointing, but not so big a deal since I have other levers I prefer.Now for a simple chain repair. No problem getting the pin out, but forget about ever getting it back in. There is not enough thread to accommodate the pulled pin, so trying to re-engage the thread while keeping the pin aligned was a real pain. Then, as I finally feel a bit of bite, it turns out the thread is giving way. Now it's worthless until I can re-thread it.I'm glad other folks have had better luck with this tool than I have, but I can't help but warn other buyers about the problems I've encountered."
4,Good basic bike tool,"I'm not an expert at bikes, so it would have been nice if this tool came with at least a small instruction manual explaining the names and functions of some of the attachments. The screwdrivers and hex wrenches are pretty much standard to what size fasteners are on most bikes, so that's an asset. Can't complain much, it has suited my needs so far."
2,Not what I expected,"This was my first bicycle tool to carry with on my rides. I didn't do enough research to realize that it doesn't have all the tools I would need. I need a wrench to take a tire off since I don't have quick release tires. I wouldn't be able to replace a tire on the road with this tool. I'll keep looking and do better research in the future. The quality is so so. The philips screw driver is too short and I couldn't adjust my derailer with it, and the flat head screw driver is too short as well. I couldn't get the tire levers off without another screw driver and then I scratch the multi-tool up. As I used the other hex tools they weren't very stable and I spent more time trying to hold the tool correctly than actually fixing my bike. Maybe I'm not coordinated enough to use this tool."
5,GODS HOLY WORK,I AM CURRENTLY STATIONED OVERSEAS AND I DON'T GET MUCH TV. BUT I WATCH THIS TAPE ALL THE TIME AND IT INSPIRES ME A GREAT DEAL TO SEE THE LORD HAS BLESSED BISHOP PATTERSON TO PRODUCE AN EXCELLENT VIDEO THAT I CAN WATCH ALL THE TIME. IT'S A TRUE BLESSING TO WATCH AND LISTEN TO GOOD MUSIC.
3,You Can Learn Sign Language,"This is a nice well-illustrated book for young children ages 6-8. The photographs are colorful and most are easy to understand.I chose this particular book as a text for my sign language classes. I do not, however, agree with some of the signs. Some of the hands in the numbers section on the clock are facing backwards as if the person is signing to himself. The sign for ""what"" is not used in the question ""What is your name, but rather a gesture (a shrug) has replaced the word. Although I disagree with a few of the signs chosen in this text, basically the book is very good in layout, design, and making the subject interesting for children."
5,Babies and Girls.. and a Island too!,"Great fun!As a young girl, I read this book over and over. Loved it! Magical. Shipwrecked on an Island with babies in their care - the girls in this story have an adventure. I was so jealous! I loved babies, still do! This book was dreamy fun.The author, Carol R. Brink, also wrote ""The Pink Motel,"" my other fav in the 5th grade. Have them both, and will treasure them forever. All my daughters read this, and liked it, as every little girl would.Delightful! Buy it! thanks, Gramma Sally"
5,Fond memories,"This is one of the few books I remember reading as a young girl. I passed it on to my younger sister who adored it. She found our original copy (yellowed and dog-eared) and I now have it again. I am excited that my niece is finally old enough to read it and share in the adventures of that magical place called Baby Island. Even in today's world of TV, videos and computers, I am sure young girls everywhere will still love to escape to that little tropical island with all those babies."
5,this was my favorite book as a kid,"I absolutely loved this book. Must have read it 20 times. I used to play in the yard with my dolls and little brothers and sister, pretending we were stranded on an island! Great adventure for girls!"
4,A baby lovers book,I read this book for the first time when I was in 4th grade. I am still and always have been a baby lover. This is a terrific book for any young girl (or boy) who loves babies and children. It is an extmely entertaining book. I introduced this book to some of my 5th grade students who I knew were interested in babysitting and loved being around younger children and they loved the book as well.
5,"Two young girls cope with shipwreck, babies, a grumpy hermit","This book is a great story of two great women-in-the-making. Shipwrecked and alone, young Scots Mary and Jean are unfailingly clever at finding food, water, shelter, and just about everything else they need for the babies whose lives they save, and the grumpy old hermit whose life they rescue. At the same time, they are real girls - singing, playing, crying, praying, and taking care of each other. Read this book to sons and daughters both for examples of strong, brave children, and read it yourself for a laugh and nostalgic look back at childhood.I've been looking for Baby Island for 25 years and am thrilled to find it again!"
1,The Cake Crumbles,I bought this for my children birthday cakes and every time I use this the cake pan it falls apart no matter what you do with it. I just it for jello now for fun with my children.
1,WORST $ EVER SPENT,"I got this station not even a week ago and its the worst money that I probably spent. Granted it was only around $50 but trust me you will regret every penny. Its impossible to set the time on this thing since the button that you are supposed to hold onto it doesn't work 90% of the time. When you have it pressed it just literally doesn't move the clock hands and as you take the batteries out and reinsert them it magically starts moving again and when you push the clock set button again same thing happens and it doesn't DO ANYTHING! This is the worst thing Honeywell made...I would not recommend this thing even as a useless piece of firewood or anything you could potentially take out your aggression out on, otherwise you'd be wasting your money."
2,Ok Just As Long As You Don't Use the Clock,"Bought this weather station back in the fall, mainly for the ability to monitor the outside temperature/humidity as well as the indoor temperature and humidity. That part works great. But, if you plan to use the clock, good luck. When you press time set, the thing goes nuts and the time hands swirl around and around. I did manage to set it once (how I don't know) but, come DST and trying to set it ahead one hour.... well, I gave up on it.Bottom line - if you want to know the temperature indoors and out as well as the humidity, then this works great. Don't ever plan on using the rather large clock portion though."
2,Wonderful opera! Unacceptable cuts!,"Shostakovitch's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk is a masterpiece. A previous movie had been made of it, less effective than this one. Petr Weigl film is nice to watch but has a major drawback: more than 50 minutes of the score are cut. Whichever may have been the rationale for such choice, it is hardly understandable. Due to some of the cuts, the sequence of the plot even becomes somewhat strange because you feel that something must surely be missing in the action. Leaving out scenes like the Boris' ghost scene is unforgivable - this scene clearly shows that Katerina is haunted by the spirit of the man she killed (establishing the connection with Shakespeare's Macbeth and Verdi's opera). So, to me, due maily to the cuts but also to some dubious director's choices, this movie rates very low. Unfortunate, but true, considering that it could easily have been otherwise. Respecting the whole score, for instance, would have done a much better job."
3,Bargain recording - mediocre film,"The soundtrack is the best thing about this release - this is the recording made by Rostropovitch, Vishnevskaya et al towards the end of the great Russian soprano's career. By buying this DVD you get that splendid recording for less than the CD version. But you also get a film superimposed on the recording with variable results. There are the usual problems with lip-synching but it does attempt to be a real film of the piece. But the director has opted for a sort of romanticised realism which is essentially decorative rather than insightful. Opera is not a realistic medium, of course, so this film is no more successful than others in finding a solution for this ongoing problem. Has any director other than Bergman (with Mozart's Magic Flute) made a film of an opera which works on its own terms?"
3,Useful for the clueless; useless for the Y2K-savvy,"If you're tuned in to the Y2K problem, this little book is a waste of your time (all five minutes). However, if you're looking for a way to tune others in, and those others may have a short attention span or a tendency to freak when confronted by recommendations from folks like FEMA or the Red Cross, this is the book to give them."
4,Light and entertaining,"I used ""Got Beans?"" as stocking stuffers and sent a few others to friends. The feedback I got was quite positive! It is humorous to read, light and entertaining, but thought provoking at the same time. It made me realize the specific preparations I may need to make for Y2K. My son and his college roommate say that Y2K is a hot topic with them and they used this book to educate their friends on the subject."
1,Cute and Compact but not really helpful,"This book is cute with the humor in making light of Y2K but it doesn't offer nearly enough helpful info for people who want to know how to prepare. There are several other books that are available here and they are FULL of helpful info. Also this book should not sell for any more than $2.95 instead of the $7.95 that it's going for. It's a small book (5""x5"") so you can tuck it in your bag but that's about the only handy thing about it! You're much better off getting titles by James Talmadge Stevens,Victor Porlier,Edward Yourdan and Bruce F. Webster. Also an excellent guide for yourself, your family and community Y2K Citizen's Action Guide put out by The Utne Reader. Good Luck!"
5,Scott Dittman Gives a Great Performance,"If you thought Scott Dittman was brilliant in Skid Marks the Movie you have to see this one. Dittman gives a phenomenal performance in this surprising little film. I loved the opening sequence and the way he handled every situation that popped up, I was very entertained by Scott Dittman. I'm still smiling as I type this, wow!Now I'm searching for more Scott Dittman movies."
2,Superficial,"I think the Chinese have developed wonderfully sophisticated systems of Astrology, Feng Shui, and Healing among other things. I'd never come to this opinion from reading this book, however. I found it to be simplistic and shallow in it's content. The delineations are more surface descriptions minus compassionate, psychological insight. If I had flipped through it at a store or library first I would most definitely placed it back on the shelf. Sorry, it just wasn't for me."
5,"In depth, yet accessible","I found this book to be a good combination of in-depth yet accessible information about Chinese astrology. It gives what I've found to be quite accurate information about the various animal sign of your year of birth, while getting more detailed with information about the other influences under which you are born. It's quite easy to read and follow, and entertaining as well. I would definitely recommend it. (And Lau should rewrite those awful placemats you find at the Chinese restaraunts. For years I thought I was a dragon but I'm not!)"
1,"Elementary, Mr Watson","I purchased this book based on the comments and reviews of other readers. So, I made the mistake of thinking that this was a book on advanced Chinese astrology. This is elementary Chinese astrology. Which is equivalent to looking up your sun sign in your local newspaper. If you're serious about learning Chinese astrology, then try and find a book on Zi Ping Four Pillars of Destiny."
5,A Great Response to the DaVinci Code,"Dan Brown's book is fiction, but there are claims that he makes that have confused some of the basic issues of Christianity. This thoughtful and well produced video curriculum will help to dispel many of the myths and untruths spelled out in the novel. I used this in my church and we found it very useful in opening dialogues with those who have read the book or seen the movie."
3,Good concept but requires adult assistance,I like the whole concept but my 2 yr old is not able to change the pics on her own. She loves doing puzzles so I thought that she would love this. It holds her attention for about 5 minutes tops. This product would be better if it did not require my constant assistance to change the pictures for her and i think she would be more entertained if she was able to do it on her own as well. I like that all the pices fit securely inside and has a handle for carrying. unfortunately the handle was broken but not worth the effort of returning- Nothing a piece of duct tape won't fix!
5,Wonderful skill building toy!,"This toy is great! We were introduced to it by my son's speech therapist. He loved it the first time he used it. It's fun for the kids and it helps reinforce color knowledge, sorting, following patterns using the colored sides, encourages imagination using the black & white sides and is great for fine motor control. My son received it when he on his second birthday, still uses it daily 7 months later and now my almost one year old daughter is beginning to play with it also. The entire toy is still in perfect condition despite being subjected to a toddler's handling. I also love that it is totally gender neutral. I recommend this toy to everyone!"
2,Not my best choice,"I was not impressed with this product, tried to cancel the order but cancelled the wrong item. Not much I can say about it."
5,No complaints here,"Wonderful video. Even though I had seen every video on here, it was well worth me buying it. Where the streets have no name is an entireley different version than I had ever seen. That was very cool. And it was nice to see One Tree Hill with clear sound & picture, compared to the version I have from the Rattle and Hum outtakes. I would recommend this video to anyone."
3,Fabric is very soft.,"My granddaughter loves the softness and the color. The length of the blouse is a little too short, so I wouldn't order any more. When she lifts her arms or moves about it rides up and shows her tummy."
3,Armchair Reading,An excellent way to become familiar with Celtic stories but a more avid Celtophile will not find their thirst quenched!
3,Not a guidebook for the novice.,"This is really the Art of make up. It doesn't give you step-by-step instructions for applications. It has great pictures of celebrities and autobiographical text by Aucoin. I thought it would help me learn more about make- up applications. I guess I wanted a face map. The pictures are great and he is an artist, but I didn't learn much from the book, other than some history on Kevin Aucoin..."
2,not a thorough application book,"I bought this book thinking that it would help me learn to apply makeup, professionally. The picutres are dramatic, but there is no advise for everyday people."
1,The worst from the 3,"Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand."
4,The beginning of a legend,Kevyn Aucoin is a truly inspiring figure and this first book of his is a great kick off to his coffee table book career! Its *alittle* dated at this point and you can tell when reading his other books that his techniques matured. But he inspired me to become a makeup artist and I still use this book as a reference on some points because its timeless and Kevyn is just a god of makeup!
5,Wow! What a Book!,"As a chiropractor, nutritionist, author, lecturer and parent, I have had to relate to a variety of people--employees, collegues, independent contractors, patients, students and children.In EXECUTIVE THINKING, Leslie Kossoff has shown the dynamics of my own thinking, the dynamics of these relationships, and most importantly, how to utilize this information.Anyone alive should read this book. It applies to every aspect of one's life. I cannot recomment it highly enough. Buy it, read it and integrate its principles into all aspects of your life."
5,Insightful Visions for Dynamic Development,"Kossoff delivers in this book. She not only shows you how to dream, she shows you how to reach and realize the new vision of your organization and your place in it. In clear, graceful and logical writing, she gives you step-by-step guidelines for creative, ""out-of-the-box"" thinking and the means to harness the ideas that emerge. Using compelling case studies, she reveals how this technique energizes management structure to move ahead, empowering individuals throughout the corporation. The book will have a significant impact in maximizing operations. A MUST READ FOR EXECUTIVES ON EVERY LEVEL."
2,Disappointing,"This movie had the potential to be really good--the acting talent present in the film is superb, but the story line moves too slow and becomes boring after awhile. Instead of bringing out emotion and introspection, this film led to extreme frustration . . . I watched this movie because I read how overlooked and unrecognized it was in the theaters . . . Folks, do yourselves a favor and watch Dangerous Beauty instead . . .you won't be disappointed with its quality."
1,A Waste of Time,The critics must have been really drunk when they rated this movie. That or they were bribed with a fantastic dinner. The movie is full of nonsense and is looooong winding. Easily one of the worse movies I have ever seen.
1,"Nova Development, Invoices and estimates Pro 2.0","not satisfied with the technical support or product, seems to be the only thing compatible with Vista, however does not print 2 copies or have an easy navigation though work that needs to be done as in the last invoice and estimates pro for XP"
1,Don't spend your money on junk.,"The software is ok for a novice. The invoices take alot of time if you want to customize. The reports are garbage, they can not be customized in any way. I am taking advantage of the 90 day money back guarantee from the maunfactor."
1,One big headache.,"I thought this would be a quick, inexpensive solution to my small business's needs for a professonal invoicing system. After two days' of trying to adapt its templates--rather amateurish-looking--to accept the kind of entries I want to make, I'm returning it. Users' manual is opaque. The insertion of new ""fields"" into the templates is quirky, and the changing of font styles and sizes has to be done field-by-field, rather than in complete sections (such as address blocks) at a time. Couldn't figure out how to expand fields to allow more than one line of text, such as in the ""Description"" line (to describe service or product). Users' manual no help on this. Unless you have lots of experience designing documents and customizing forms on a computer, avoid this software. I'm looking for a more professional-looking, more user-friendly alternative with a good, clearly-written users' manual."
2,Pittsburgh Steeler Cling,The cling only sticks on the back side. I wanted to put it on the inside window of my car.
5,A must-read to learn about Welch's success strategies,"This is an insightful examination of Welch's management principles, initiatives and strategies that will be valuable to anyone in business. It sheds light on the origin, evolution, implementation and significance of Welch's signature initiatives and concepts--such as ""#1, #2,"" ""fix, close or sell,"" boundaryless, the four E's of leadership, globalization, Six Sigma, the learning organization and more--and explains how he turned GE into a global powerhouse. It also shows how managers can apply Welch's methods to their own businesses. Jeffrey Krames has done an outstanding job of capturing the mindset and seminal ideas of one of history's most successful CEOs. Highly recommended."
3,"Get Jack Welch's ""Winning"" Instead...","This isn't a bad book by any stretch of the imagination. However I found it hard to follow at times. It simply outlays some of Jack's strategies one-by-one with only a limited amount of examples to provide context and concrete learning experiences. I would strongly recommend you get Jack Welch's ""Winning"" with Suzy Welch instead. ""Winning"" gives more concrete examples, is much easier to read, and the me-to-you conversation style is almost like sitting through a high powered seminar with Jack, rather than reading a book. And I have to say, the way Jack applies all the ""management theories"" you typically learn in a university degree into a practical, simple business approach anyone can use is just amazing. He really is a management ""guru"". I would have loved to have worked with him at his peak!"
5,beautiful,Lyrical graceful hammer dulcimer playing by Russell Cook of a wide variety of musical styles from Jim Croce to Blessed Assurance. Very enjoyable.
1,"Poor quality, not OEM","This product appears to be an OEM LG adaptor, from its picture and lack ofdetail. Caveat emptor, it is not! This is a knock-off that failed on meafter only three uses, when the plug at the phone end retreated into itshood, and I could not plug it in. I took the hood off, reseated theplug, and taped it back together. The next time I used it, though, theentire plug (wires broken off) remained with the phone when I tried todisconnect it.The item is not as pictured, as it does not have the LG logo on the side."
3,"5 stars for Sting 1 for the band, average=3 stars","I purchased this VHS as a compensation for not being able to attend the concert. While I still want to see Sting Live, this may have not been the best tour for me to catch if this show is indicative of the whole tour... While Sting was up to par; charismatic and wieldy as ever; the band left much to be desired. I have come to expect so much from Sting's back up since the days of Bring on the Night, and Soul Cages... These new players were not in sync, and the dischord often distracted from Sting's vocals. And the back up singers, they didn't seem to FEEL the music, their movements were so staged and forced, they seemed more focused on keeping their tummies sucked than singing the songs... It is still worth it to watch but if you can only own one Sting concert video, this is not the one to get. Bring on the Night or MTV Unplugged are the ones to get."
1,Worst DVD sound quality I EVER heard!!!!!!!!,Don't waste your time an money! The audio is muffled - at best.
3,Dolby Digital is the only way to get good audio,"Just thought I should share that if you do not have a Dolby Digital receiver, you will have audio problems with this DVD. All reports on audio difficulty with the sound fading in and out, etc, are from people not using a Dolby Digital decoder receiver.Compression problems, absence of vocal effects, Cheb's loud vocal mix on Desert Rose are still a problem using DD."
3,TRUE STING FANS WILL BE UPSET,"Yes it is true.... The dvd sounds terrible. The 5.1 and 2 channel both ""fade in and out badly"" and I am sorry to say that there is no BUTTON on your receiver that will help this problem. I am currently attempting to contact someone from EMI to see if there is going to be a fix, and then a possible replacement. Anyone who is a true fan knows that Sting goes out of his way to make sure his recordings are TOP rate. I am not sure what happened here. I even verified the problem with my local stereo stores who also have disks with the same problem. ( I must admit that the video is excellent, and when the audio isn't fading it is GREAT!) If any other bummed out fan is interested in what I find out feel free to email me. dprosser@wi.rr.com"
2,Digital receiver doesn't help,"In response to another review concerning the type of receiver to use - I have a Dolby Digital receiver (Sony/Bose system) and I also have problems with the sound fading in and out, etc regardless of the sound field setting. In fact another review described exactly the same problems I have. The band instruments sound fine until just before the vocal starts or continues then abruptly drop off. Changing the mode to 2 channel stereo does not help the problem. I'm currently awaiting the delivery of another disk that hopefully will have quality sound. Otherwise the show is superb. With normal DVD audio my rating would be 5 stars."
5,Crisp and clean!,"I saw Sting perform live this summer, in Moline, Illinois, and this DVD is almost a mirror image of that performance. Granted, every live performance will be unique...but this DVD captures all of the music, all of the set design, and more! This is also one of the most crisp and clean, musically as well as visually, recordings of a concert I have ever seen. This DVD also captures a beautiful selection of songs, from almost all of his solo career, and a couple from the golden days spent with the ""Police"". I happen to be a fan more of his personal work, though, than that of the Police. If you've followed Sting's career with any love for his music at all, you should be quite happy with this DVD!"
3,Mediocre at best,"There are several problems with this DVD. First, Sting does not appear to be at the top of his game- missing some notes, unable to hold others. Second, the band is not tight- poor coordination between bass and drums esp. Third, the sound quality is poor. I have a set of five identical full range speakers with a good set of components all chosen with music concerts in mind. My first reaction listening to this DVD was panic that one of my components had failed. Changing to 2 channel helped a little but overall the sound was dry, excessively bright and uninvolving. Bass notes were bloated in many cases and wispy in others.There are some good songs on this DVD- enough to merit purchase by Sting devotees. But not, unfortunately, enough to delight those of us who aply a broader set of criteria."
4,great concert,A lively concert featuring most of his big hits. It was quick in arriving and quite a bargain.
3,"Occasionally fun, but disappointing","It's true that Cheb Mani's voice is about 10dB too loud on Desert Rose. What were they thinking? The sound quality on the rest of the disc is ok - sure it's live, but it's no James Taylor-level quality. This is one of those discs that you watch once, and may occasionally pull out for single songs."
4,good but not perfect,"although sting is not that good to be a stage performer, i did enjoy the songs, i have a complete surround system and the output was quite ok, i do not know why other people had some bad sound outputs.....the pre-performance interview was quite boring, too long i guess..."
2,Better on CD than DVD,"I watched this last night. Sting is better to listen to on CD than to watch on DVD as it is rather boring to watch as there is not much stage presence. This DVD is not in my ""top 20"" concert DVD list. This one is not a keeper."
5,Better With Age,"Sting`s musical style together with his Jazz roots before The Police show how truly amazing he has grown as an artist.A true superstar in our generation. A fantastic concert, great camera angles and a great DVD to have on even while cleaning the house!"
2,Poor Audio Quality!!,When playing this DVD I seriously thought there was something wrong with my system! The audio comes and goes in waves when played in Dolby 5.1 and is not much better when played in stereo. I wish I could have returned it for a full refund.
3,Poor sound,"I agree with some of the reviews here. This DVD does not provide the dynamic sound to give the viewer a ""LIVE"" feel. It does not give the kick people look for at a concert. Certainly not as enjoyable as ""THE CORRS: LIVE AT LANSDOWNE ROAD DVD"", despite Sting's good vocal performance (can't hear his bass guitar clearly though)."
5,Best DVD out there!!!,"Some of you people gave this awesome DVD no credit. This is, by far, my most treasured DVD I own, and I own 20+ DVD's. I saw this tour in Milwaukee, WI and the DVD is ALMOST identicle to the show I saw. I'm not a huge Sting fan, but I am a fan and believed I need to give credit where credit is due, this DVD is for anyone, fan or not, BUY IT--you won't be sorry. Best Sting song---Seven Days!"
4,An uplifting and joyful live performance,"The video footage on this DVD is good but 5.1 audio is somewhat uneven - the concert sounds more balanced when switched to 2 channel stereo. Nonetheless the DVD is a valuable addition to an audio library, especially considering the brief, but charming appearances by Stevie Wonder and Cheb Mami on Brand New Day and Desert Rose respectively. Just sit back, forget the technical aspects, and enjoy the feelgood music of Sting - a great DVD to watch after a stressful day at work!"
4,sting at his best,"If your a sting fan, this is the DVD for you. The behind the scenes portion of the DVD shows another side of Sting right before the concert begins. Sting's performance of Fragile, Moon Over Bourbon Street and of course Desert Rose is worth the price by themselves."
2,"My Bard, Sting, is Perfect!","I couldn't get the sound right on my PC's DVD player (with SoundBlaster Live Value!) but when I plugged this into my surround sound on a regular DVD player, its full glory was revealed! There is no better composer, musician or lyricist as far as I'm concerned!Sting is the poet/singer (bardaugh) of the century! And this concert is very memorable in its perfection."
2,"well, alright","Having seen two concerts of this tour, i have to say that I am honestly disappointed by this video. The band is not that well-played together yet, the three shaking girls aren't the greatest vocalists, the mix is disappointing, (where's the bass, bassdrum etc), sometimes it seems as Sting is happy that they made it through the song. There are mistakes on the tape (wrong chords etc)...there have been better videos and concerts, and it tells me, never go to the third concert of a new tour."
2,Very Disappointed,The sound quality is so poor it is almost unbearable to watch. I had high expectations based on Bring On The Night. I thought for a moment the disc was defective until I read other reviews. EMI should consider fixing and rereleasing.
2,Thank god I kept my receipt!!,"I just bought this DVD from the store hours ago and came home expecting to see a high quality live performance, which it was, no doubt...Only problem was the not-so-high-quality audio that came along with the package. Everything else was just fine, but seriously, am I supposed to shut up and pretend I didn't notice? This is really Crappy sound. Who's playing with the volume control? I'm sorry I have to do this, but this one's going back tomorrow morning. Still, I shure hope they re-release it with the glitch fixed..."
2,dvd audio problems,this would be an awesome dvd if it werent for the fade out audio problems. i have a harmon kardon surround sound system --not top of the line but you would expect it to at least play dvds.....and it does...all my other live in concert dvds work just fine. the people who say this is great audio must be the lucky ones without a defective copy.
3,"Great artist, but band could be better","I am a huge Sting fan, have great respect for him, but I do not understand why he keeps touring with Dominic Miller on guitar. Miller's solos are by far the worst I have ever heard and almost always seems out of tune with the rest of the band. I preferred Vinnie on drums. Manu is not bad, but is not as talented. It also struck me that the slow, jazzy songs are the best of the concert."
3,Good concert - bad audio . . .,"I bought this right when it came out, before there were any reviews here - Sting and co. perform a good concert, but as the other reviewers have noted, the 5.1 audio fades in and out on many of the songs, I'm really surprised this made it past the pre-production review process - this should have never been released. If you can get past this problem, it is a good concert, but for the audio purists, this will bug the heck out of you :-)"
2,What a shame - Sting without the honey!,"I was really looking forward to this but unfortunately I agree with the reviews I have read of this DVD. I saw this concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in May 2000. I had never seen him before but it was fantastic and Sting at his very best. The DVD disappoints because the stereo soundtrack has been created direct from the mixing desk without any effects, particularly on Stings vocals. As much as I love his and Cheb Mami's voice on Desert Rose, they are far too loud in the mix and make it near impossible to enjoy. I would love to see Ten Summoners Tales on DVD which was a film recorded during the recording of that album at Sting's home in England. Or Bring on the Night, or his previous music videos - please...there has been so much better than this from Sting."
2,"Great Music, Horrible Sound Transfer","I must agree with most of the reviewers on this site. I wish I had listened to them before buying this DVD. The music is great, as usual from Sting. But the sound is CRAP! Even listening on stereo headphones the sound goes in and out, up and down, really loud and then barely discernible. It also always seems to go down when Sting is singing or speaking. Whoever was running the board this night should be shot... repeatedly... in the knees... with a bow & arrow... for days. I mean, it's ridiculous. I'm going to try and return it, but I'm not hopeful. See if you can rent this first (try Netflix) and see how it does on your sound system. If it's good (or even okay) buy it, because it's a great concert. Please take this review to heart from someone who didn't."
3,Can Anyone Supply A Track List? Seems Amazon Can't,If anyone can supply the track list for this disc it would be appreciated? gave 3-stars as I have not seen it. Poor flexibility with this set up.
2,more problems than solutions?,"As a student of its originators and a practitioner of the grounded theory approach, this book was for me a bit like reading an intelligent observer's critique of the conversations overheard at my family reunion, without knowing any of the context, history, or quirks of the family members themselves. Although Dey titles this book ""Guidelines,"" I found it instead to be a methodological critique, as acknowledged in the editorial review provided by this website. Many issues Dey raises are reasonable and provocative, but his critique of the major methods texts of grounded theory bypasses the many hundreds of published examples of grounded theory research and thus doesn't address how the method is actually used in practice. This book will be of interest to serious grounded theory devotees who are able to see beyond some errors and misconceptions to a thoughtful exploration of important ideas behind grounded theory analysis, but it may discourage and confuse novices."
1,Grabit performed poorly on deck screws!,"I am removing deck screws from my decking... they are 2 1/2 screws and a few of them stripped the phillips head when I was removing them. I worked with this tool for over an hour and only was able to remove one screw. And then I burned up the ""easy-out"" end of the tool. I was using the middle sized tool, since my screw size is #8. The boring end of the tool acted like it was dull and did not want to drill into the screw head... and the lack of depth was likely the reason it didn't work. After the middle size was totaled, I tried the small size... it bored in easily, but the tool was too small to work on such a large screw. I feel I wasted $20 and a lot of my time ordering and testing it."
1,JUNK,"Drill head is made of something about as durable as coathanger wire, bit barely worked on a clean screw, rusted? forget about it. drill tip wore to uselessness on 4th screw, extractor rounded out by fifth, you'd do better with your money by buying a lottery ticket, at least you'd have a small chance of getting your money's worth....the only reason I rated it one star is that they won't let me rate it ZERO stars."
1,Useless,Don't believe the hype...The removal side of the bit snapped off on my first attempt to remove a rusted screw from a snowblower. Waste of money.
1,broke within 5 minutes,I should have read more reviews on other sites. I followed the directions to a T. The product couldn't get the screw out and actually broke within minutes of trying.
1,No Good,"This product was no good for my use. I needed to remove 2 small (m4) screws that I stripped. For some silly reason, Honda puts what appears to be red loc-tite on the screws that hold the power door lock actuator to the door latch; hence the reason I stripped 2/3 screws. This product was useless. It broke the head off one screw and did nothing to the other screw. Both bits I used look like they wouldn't work in the future. I ended up having to remove the latch from my car and use pliers to remove the 2 screws in question. I will be returning this useless product."
1,Making a bad situation worse,"First the drill end was too soft for the broken bolt - doesn't matter turning counter-clockwise, it just won't drill. Oh the bid slips too while my high speed won't. After using my high speed drill the extraction end broke without much torque applied. Now the embedded piece is too hard for the high-speed drill. So far I've worn out a few high-speed drill bits including a diamond grinding bid. I'm in the process of butchering my project with a saw off disk in order to get the corroded bolt out, making a bad situation worse. Pro grade baloney, even the Chinese junk is better. With so many one star ratings I should have checked before purchase. Seems like I'm not the only one having this problem."
2,More expensive than other brands and has some issues.,"The sizes 2 and 3 do a good job of gripping the screw, but once you get the screw out, it is hard to separate it from the bit. It also does not seem to be worth the extra expense of this brand--Home Depot had much cheaper options. If you could get it cheaper, I'd give it three stars."
5,It did the trick.,"I had a stubborn screw during a carburetor rebuild and the small extractor saved my butt. So yeah, I'd recommend this product."
2,Not very accurate,"It works as a gauge and I use it, but it can vary as much as 1/8 of an inch depending on how hard you are pushing on it. That can add up to quite a bit after 20 rows of siding with each row based on the previous. Would be much better, if it were more rigid."
5,Fun and fascinating!,More Rock Family TreesWe own all of Peter Frame's book. Interesting and great if you're in to trivia.
5,I Love This New Scent,"The Manhattan Diffusion fragrances are known for being sophisticated and unusual. I've always been a big fan of Bliss and Festivus, but this new scent, Pearue -- unbelievably wonderful. So warm and rich. Everyone on my Christmas list is getting this. Aren't they lucky?"
5,Lifelike Doll,My little girl never has liked dolls until Baby Annabell. She has had her doll for more than a year and still loves her. She is worth the money. This doll is so lifelike and fun to pretend with. My 88 year old grandmother loved her and wanted one of her own! I highly recommend this doll!!!!!!!!
2,"Problems with doll, big problems with returning defective product to Amazon.com.","While this doll is great fun for our Grandaughter to play with, we have now been shipped 2 dolls from Amazon.com - Toys R Us that have been defective. The dolls do not go to sleep unless you remove the batteries. We had so much trouble returning the first doll to Amazon.com that we decided to just keep the second one to avoid the hassle. We are really disappointed with the poor Customer Service at Amazon.com - Toys R Us with this order, and cannot recommend this doll to anyone else."
3,The doll is just sitting...,"My daughter goes on and off playing with this doll. The limited functions tend to bore her (she was 5 when she got it.) Also, she feels bad when the baby cries. Maybe she just doesn't want to spend the time it takes to play with this doll correctly? I have to say though, the doll is pretty and there are many accessories available to go along."
2,Disappointed in Baby Annabell,"My three year old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it. However, Baby Annabell sounds very mechanical and we cannot get her to cry. When she sucks on her pacifier or bottle, it does not sound like it did the first couple of days my daughter played with it. We can also hear noises in the dolls head when the doll coos, babbles, or cries. I expected more from Zapf Creations and from Baby Annabell."
3,No Tears,"I just bought Baby Annabell for my daughter. We adore the doll, however, she does not show tears when crying. When she sucks on the bottle, does not look like any water has gone out. The doll did not come with English instructions! Does anyone have any suggestions?"
3,Fun.... for a day or two,"I'm not sure why a kid would want a baby that cries in the first place, but maybe that's supposed to be the ""educational"" value of this toy? This doll is heavy - too heavy for my 3 year old. She thought it was fun for a while, but got tired of it quickly. To be honest, I'm glad. I didn't like listening to the doll all the time anyway. I also wish they made the doll with brown eyes. I'm glad they make a African American doll, but I really wish a major doll company would realize not all ""ethnicities"" are the same. What about Asian or Hispanic children?"
5,Very pleased!!,"I got this doll for my daughter for Christmas and it has worked as described. The tear function does take a while to work but once I got the tear ducts full enough she cried everytime. I think it is a very cute doll. My daughter loves this toy and I have yet to hear a malfunction in her. I even bought a little wooden crib so that she has a place to sleep, maybe next we'll get some new clothes for her."
3,Fun if it worked right,"My 3 year old who adores dolls got this doll and I think she would be great except that we got one that won't cry, tear or sleep so it's obviously not working right. My daughter has loved playing with her anyway but I'm sure once we get one that works right, she'll like it that much more! I am just disappointed to have to go get a new one and go through the hassle of exchanging her, etc. Finding one hasn't been easy but I'm sure now that the holidays are over, it will be a bit easier! Cute concept if only it worked right the first time!"
4,Cutie Annabell,"Baby annabell is so cute. She crys like a real baby, I think thats cool. Its a little hard for me to give her the bottle because you have to push it into her mouth really far and squeeze. I like when she sucks the pacifier and when she goes to sleep. When she wakes up to a noise she cries real tears and I sing to her and she starts to laugh. She is worth the money."
1,GREAT!!,This is GREAT!! I love this toy!!! I dont see why all parents have to be so grumpy with this toy. I adore it. The only thing is she only cries out of one eye. But I dont really mind it. It is a great example for kids all ages. I HIGHLY recommend this toy.
5,My Neice is in LOVE,"My 7 year old neice received Annabell for Christmas and it was love at 1st sight. That doll makes the cutest sounds she's very realistic, I'm buying one for my Grand daughter, for little girls who aren't around a real life baby this doll gives them the opportunity to bond and feel maternal."
2,Great Doll Just don't lose the bottle,"My daughter received this doll for Christmas. It was an instant hit with her. The doll is very life like. However, I would only recommend this doll if you are very adept at keeping track of the bottle. This doll will not function without the bottle. I have tried to obtain another bottle, but no one will sell just the bottle. Zapf offered to send one, however that was 7 weeks ago. I emailed them again and they said it takes 6 weeks because of production issues. I can't believe they would sell a product whose primary function relies upon an accessory they cannot produce readily. Fortunately for us we did not lose the bottle, but rather the dog chewed the end of it. It still works somewhat, although it drips a lot of water. My daughter however, would be entirely disappointed if we had lost it all together. I hopeing I can ""limp"" it through until the replacement comes."
1,SUPER THIN (FLAT STOMACH),"this doll has a super flat stomach so she cant get put in real baby clothes or preemie clothes. She laughs uncrontrolibbly!,it is really annoying!!!!!! My cousin (5 years old) hates this doll because she dropped her once on accident and now she does not even sleep. All annabell does is laugh,laugh,laugh and laugh some more. the laugh is also super fake sounding! annabell is also ugly and a cheap fake looking face. the tears dont come out at all so dont even try getting it because you think the tears would be awsome. I was so dissapointed with her so i got rock-a-bye chou chou and she is super cute (actually the cutest doll face i have ever seen). rock-a-bye also sounds and acts much realer. I would not but annabell unless you want a huge dissapointment. If you want a satisfied child...get love me chou chou or rock-a-bye chou chou!!!!!!"
3,African Americans children left out,I am an African American girl and this baby doll does not come in the color i wanted it only comes in white
5,Fabulous,"""It"" is, for my money, the best film of all time. Clara Bow is absolutely stunning. Although people have called her a sex symbol, this movie makes a good argument that she was a feminist."
4,Kino dvd of 'IT',I read Amazons reviews to see how others rate the movies for quality. I didnt see anything wrong with the Kino transfer & i think the score was catchy. I dont have the money to go out & buy another one from Image just because the picture is a bit sharper & i enjoyed the documentary on the Kino dvd. From a average buyer thats my 2 cents.
4,Great Silent Film Classic,"It's an interesting story regarding the reason that I bought this film. One day, out of the clear blue, my 90 year old grandmother mentioned this film. I wasn't familiar with the film, nor have I ever been a silent film aficionado. I did some research and learned that Clara Bow was quite the idol in her time. And, this film was one of her best.After viewing ""It"", I was unexpectantly pleased. I was impressed with both the plot and acting of this old silent classic. The film kept me interested throughout. In this film, Clara Bow is truely ""It"". She's cute and flirty in 1920's style. I highly recommend this DVD to silent film lovers and modern movie lovers alike. If nothing else, the film provides a great history lesson for classic cinematography. Most of all, watching the film made my grandmother feel like a teenager again. Enjoy..."
5,Good basic introduction to the era for newbies,"For those of us with no prior knowledge of Japanese history, this book is a great way to start out with that particular time period. It is an easy read, with lovely pictures accompanying the text. Please be aware of that in spite of Mr. Turnbulls statements, this is a general overview of that era, NOT a serious in-depth treatment. Regarding the Genji Monogatari, the book refers to it frequently, but in a very superficial manner. The main purpose of this book seems to be to whet the reader's appetite for Japanese history, and in that aspect it was successful for my part."
2,"Too little of everyday life, as with others in this series","I think this is going to be the last of these for me. I don't need to hear any more about intrigue amongst members of the royal family (or families), which is most of the first half of the book. It gets better when it covers more of everyday life, arts and crafts, the class system, and what it was like to travel around the country. But that's the last little bit of the book."
1,And it came to pass...,"I read to ""Ether"" and felt like I'd been chloroformed. What utter drivel. History? Bwahahahahaha. Foreged steel in Pre-Columbian America? Oh, OK. Horses and War Elephants? Wow where are the fossilized remains and feral herds?"
5,Need an Intro to the Book of Mormon?,"I highly recommend this book. I have read it numerous times, and it has much in common with the Bible. It brings a great sense of peace to me when I read it. If you're interested in this book but want to learn some more about it before you actually get one (ie, what it's about, where it comes from, the history behind it, what it teaches, etc.), mormon.org/book-of-mormon has some great material. They'll direct you to a page where you can order a free copy too."
1,Pulp Fiiction,"I have read The Book of Mormon eight times and have studied it in religion classes in high school and college. Although high in fiber this pulp fiction is detrimental to the spiritual diet leading one to existential constipation. The Mormon Church has printed millions of copies of this comical ""cowboys and Indians"" story line that has clogged up library shelves, second hand stores and recycling bins for decades now. As a percentage few copies of this fantastic fallacy have ever actually been read and most who start reading it never finish the second chapter. Maybe if L. Ron Hubbard signed on as co-author with Joseph Smith sales would jump. Tom Cruise, have you read the Book of Mormon yet?"
3,A little too fine.,"This is not he chalk line for the everyday user. The line is really too fine. It comes very handy in a detailed place, but it usually doesn't cary enough calk. (I used the Tajima chalk by the way.) It is only good for one good snap. I find it works well on drywall and say were you have to rip a small amount off wood. It has its place but do not get it as your main chalk box."
5,simply the best!,This is a must for all chalkline pro's. This machine just delivers line after line. No line too short or too long. __________________yeah!
5,The Heart of God,"Like many of the people taking a retreat to the Abbey of Gethsemani, I went in search of finding the ""Heart of Thomas Merton [Father Louis O.C.S.O.]"" and I found so much more than I ever imagined. I spent part of the retreat reading this wonderful book and I found more. This is a book about the Heart of Gethsemani, the Heart of Peace and the Heart of God. An excellent read which will be read again and again and again ......"
4,Very Moving,"The author's pain, passion, and heart are open books. A wonderful book for psychologists and patients alike. The poetic imagery offers a glimpse of depression that no textbook can explain. It offers a human side every Doctor should read."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I needed an exact size replacement for an existing sink.It was delivered on time, was well packed, and installed perfectly.Noise level is acceptable. I was replacing a cast iron/porcelain sinkand the noise did change, but it is no louder."
2,SAS Men-at-Arms Angus McBride,"Don't waste your oney on this newer reprint! It looks like they took an old copy of the book and ran off McBride's awesome illustrations on a color copier! The book is flimsy and the illustrations are not sharp and crisp, but fuzzy. I am going to find a second hand copy of this book. What a disappointment!"
4,For the money this camera cannot be beat!,"I have read the recent Amazon customer reviews on the DiMAGE X1 and I do not understand some of the negative comments. I bought one for a friend last month and have used theirs since and found the results to be great plus the stabilization allowed me to get some sharp low light and close up shots that would not have been possible without a tripod. True, it's not the fastest camera around, but I purchased the camera because of it's size, 8MP, and anti-shake features. I use my Maxxum 5D DSLR for that kind of fast shooting. I think some of these users are expecting a point and shoot type camera to perform like a DSLR that it never was designed for.For an industry point of view, potential buyers may want to check out January's '06 Shutterbug magazine test report which rates this camera so high that the author admits he would recommended the DiMAGE X1 to his friends.RJ"
5,A Christmas Gift replaced,"The camera I bought, well it was a Christmas gift for my daughter, her previous camera was stolen, so I replaced it. Thank you for getting me the gift right away and ready for Christmas.She is very pleased with the camera and so am I."
1,This camera was a big mistake.,"At the time that I bought this camera, there were no reviews because it was so new. I bought it anyway because I liked the way it looked and because it had over 8 MPs. I was completely disappointed when I got the camera and realized that I couldn't have made a bigger mistake. The LCD monitor was dark and blurry. I felt like I was watching an old video that had been copied over many times. The picture quality was horrible. The pictures appeared to have this haze over it and most of them were blurry.This was literally the worst camera that I had ever come across. Luckily, I was able to return it for a full refund, but I recommend not wasting your time on this camera."
4,Good For 3 Years,"I purchased this camera from London in 2005. It still working without issue, but its outdated now..take lot of time to save picture even in small size of pic.It has got GREAT ANIT SHAKE Tech...but night vision is poor.Charging dock is great and still working after 3 years....no issue yet.But I would say, not to buy it as there are plenty of better cameras in market now..."
3,Good camera but slow taking pictures,"I bought this camera even after reading the reviews which said so many bad things about it because it seemed like it had a lot of good features for the price. It is a very good camera. The pictures are good, even though in low light the flash is not very good. It has a lot of features, you can even copy an e-mail size picture with the camera. The only thing I don't like is that it has too much shutter lag. I can't get what I want when I want it most of the time unless I am taking something still specially in low light, sometimes as much as three or four seconds. I think this is because of the camera trying to focus. So if you want to take a picture of something moving, you will most likely not get it when you want to.Other thing I would have liked is not using a craddle for downloading the pictures to the computer. Other than that I like the camera and the picture quality is good. Actually I give it 4 stars not three but I could not change it."
2,The price should be about $45-$50,"This would be a great camera for about $45-$50, based on the quality of the pictures.The lens cant focus about 30% of the time and the pictures come out blurry.Very slow shutter time, the firmware should be updated as soon as receving the camera, it helps with the quality of the LCD display, not much help with the pictures...it bosts an 8MP resolution but it looks more like it was made with a cheap 3-4MP cameraSpend a little more for a Sony DSC T-7 it is well worth it if you need a slim pocketshirt camera."
1,Can I rate this Negative 50?,"This camera is terrible. The camera takes forever to start up. If you see something good and want to capture it on camera quickly....well just forget it. If you do happen to catch the image just a fair warning it will 90% of the time be so blurry you won't see it anyhow. If you like the way it looks when you pull it from your pocket ok just remember that it may look nice, but really really sucks. Buy something, anything but this camera."
3,"Not as good as the Dimage X50, Brand New?","This camera model does not have the fast action picture taking ability as the Diamge X50 model. The camera can has a very slow reaction time.I also question whether the camera was brand new???? Amazon claime it would be, but it was missing the bag case and the SD card that the box said it should contain."
5,Great camera....awesome photos!!,"I love this camera. I get great pictures in all kinds of light, indoors or outdoors, flash or no flash. The pics are crisp and capture every detail (even stuff you don't know you're shooting!). I've had professional quality results when taking portraits. The LCD screen is a good size and the photo options are alot of fun. Even the video feature is pretty good, with a better than expected mic range. I reccomend this camera every chance I get!"
4,wonder ful,Beautiful and Nice camera.I have developed about 300 picture from this. all most all are coming good.very easy to handle.great product
1,Unstable Product,"I purchased a Western Digital Book external hard drive in Jan 2009 and thought naiivly after connecting it that I had to use the Memeo Back up program and purchased it after 30 days. I seemed to have purchased both Auto Sync and Backup and having two programs was confusing - poor explanations as to how they worked for a novice. Honestly didn't know what it was running - Sync or backup or both. I never trusted it and started using a stick for backups of my family tree. ( someone told me this was unreliable if I had to restore)... Well, a renewal, or a Memeo update appeared in Feb 2010 - I downloaded it and then the sync and backup functions quit running - it was like I had a trial version again and that was when the Book stopped working altogether. I guess this may be coincidence. I couldn't make any backups on CD until I uninistalled the Memeo. I think I will go with a Seagate AND NO auto-software."
1,Memeo Backup Premium Sucks,This program is driving me nuts. It came preinstalled on WD USB external drive. It does nothing but give me error reports on files that can't be backed up. The company only offers email support. There is no phone number listed for the company on their entire web site so forget about talking to someone.I figured if I took the bait and bought the software it would work but to no avail. When I uninstall the program it still shows up on my computer. It's like a virus.If there are any Memeo people reading this give me a call 616-399-5853.ThanksSteve Wasylkowski
1,Don't make a mistake by installing this program...,I have been trying for hours to get this horrible program (Virus) off my brother's computer. This thing does not work but is impossible to uninstall. Don't do it!
1,Anyone interested in forming a class action suit against Memeo?,The local computer firm who had to reformat my laptop to finally resolve the issues created by Memeo Autosync says their attorney is interested in filing a class-action suit for the antics their POS software performs when one elects not to buy after the trial period is over. Reply to this post with a valid email address. After 1000 addresses he says we have basis for suit..
1,This software is dangerous,Why? It claims to back up a directory like Users in Vista but on checking does not do so completely. I am using the latest downloaded version. It also fails in this way on reinstall. I cannot be bothered with it any longer so have uninstalled it. I will just use EMC Retrospect which does back up when it says it has even though as somebody else has mentioned it has an interface that reminds me of 1980s computing.If you do try this software do not be taken in by thinking that you have backed up when the software says it has done so. Try a restore to a new file or check what has been backed up and that it's what you wanted backed up!
3,Be aware that bad reviews are for old versions of this S/W,"I got Memeo as a freeby with my new Buffalo Technology RAID device in October 2009. The version is 2.50.3143. It took a few hours to back up 25gig, but I could still use my system while it was doing it. It is early days yet, but it seems to do what it says on the tin. I especially like the way that it automatically backs up files that I have modified or created while not on the network.It does have a couple of inconveniently missing features (e.g. the inability to move to a different backup target without creating a whole new backup), but another thing I liked was the very fast response from their support line when I asked how I could do this (even though the answer was, ""you can't"").The bottom line is do not be put off by the lousy reviews that seem to be based on older versions."
1,"Corrupted my computer files, uninstall failed,","This is the biggest piece of poop I ever installed on my computer. And I built my own PC from scratch (20 yrs in the industry). The install corrupted my XP files and the Memeo ""uninstall"" process failed which left corrupted files all over my computer. It took me over 5 hours to repair and I still have not managed to delete all the Memeo trash from my desktop. And I've been a tech programmer for 20 yrs. What a disaster!"
5,Quiet Genius,"Nella Larsen's ""Quicksand"" is a sleeper masterpiece. She artfully weaves a tale of coming of age & unrequited love. The characters are real, and the conclusion is open to several different interpretations."
3,Harlem Renaissance in Quicksand,"Nella Larsen's book ""Quicksand"" gives an interesting perspective on the black experience in the early 20th Century.Larsen reveals what is seldom heard about young black intellectuals frustration with black's progress at that time in gaining societal equality in America.The writing style is not exceptional but the book's message is."
2,Cotton-candy synth fluff,"Well, after listening to his later work first, I picked up this album and found it to be a disappointment. This is bland synth-pop, with pleasant, sugary melodies sung in a high, airy style, but absolutely forgettable in every respect. It goes in one ear and out the other and leaves no lasting impression.Worse, most of the songs sound almost exactly the same. I almost thought the first three songs were all parts of the same song. Throbbing synthesizer eighth-notes on the bottom, innocuous melodies on the top. Yep, it sounds like a lot of the synth-junk that was being put out in the mid-'80s. Oh well, he improved. A LOT."
2,Middling.,"A mediocre effort from guitar god Matthew Sweet. I bought this album after his latter works (the spectacular ""Girlfriend"" and ""100% Fun""), expecting more of the same, but getting very fluffy pop. It's not bad; it's just not the Matthew Sweet I'd come to know and love. ""This Above All"" is actually a very pretty song, something that one doesn't normally equate with Sweet. I would recommend this album for completists only."
2,This album scared me.,This sounds like a bad Duran Duran cover band (except for Blue Fools). I can't believe this is Matthew Sweet! It's worth listening to to see how far he's come.
1,Starved Rock History,"The book has great information in it, I have read a hardcover copy and wanted my own copy; however, this book contained only a small amount of the text and the pictures. Two thirds of the pages in the book I received were grey because of a bad scan."
2,13 Dollar Shipping????,$13 (or $25.00 for two day) delivery... for a TOP? It's not the top to a HOUSE. It's a toy.Duncan Tetra Top Deluxe Set - Tetrahedron/CubeoctahedronWhat gives?
5,walking on sunshine is really good,This is a really good song. Pam has a good voice and the pictures in the cd are very cute. I like this cd very much everyone should buy one so we can get her to number 1 and have someone famous from tucson.
3,What?,I know Pammy K and I don't think she's a very good singer. Her voice isn't consistetn and the songs on the cd scuk.
3,National Chenille Gripper Robe,I am pleased with this robe. So far it stays sapped unlike a former robe like this. It is a favorite.
4,Christmas gift,"I purchased this robe for myself a while back and I liked it so much that I decided to get one for one of my friends for Christmas. She loved it. Its very comfy and cozy!! It does shed a bit at first, but its ok after a few washings...."
4,Good source for Aran knitting,"This book includes a variety of sweater and vest patterns for men, women and children using different types of yarn. The majority of patterns are for women. The sweaters all include some type of aran/celtic pattern and many have cables. The patterns are suitable for intermediate and advanced knitters. There are colored pictures of each project and detailed charts where necessary. The book includes some knitting ""tips"" for various project to help the less advanced knitter. There are several sweaters in the book I am considering knitting. I am working on my first project and so far the instructions are easy to follow and seem accurate. I would recommend this book as a good source to someone who is interested in knitting this type of sweater."
2,Seemed like a good idea...,"OK, I know that Aran knits are bulky and covered in cables. I also understand that these aren't exactly in style. HOWEVER, I do feel some buyers remorse due to the fact that I couldn't see more photos in this book prior to my purchase. After pouring over it today, I might knit ONE thing out of the book. The styles are dated, not timeless (in my opinion). I do not recommend this book for those people looking to create something close to a classic gansey."
3,Aran Knitting patterns,Book has some nice designs in it. All the cable patterns are represented by graphic symbols which I guess some folks get along with. But I like to read the knitting pattern instructions rather than have to figure out what picture represents which stitch.
5,Lots of great patterns.,"Lots and lots of great patterns, which is really what a want when I purchase a knitting book. Also, lots of great textures."
4,Very good wheel; NOT for drills,"First, let's clarify what this is. The photo is correct; the product description is close; the name is wrong. This is a 6"" fine brass wire wheel for mounting on a 5/8"" mandrel/arbor. It can be used on a 1/2"" arbor with the included plastic bushing. It does NOT have a 1/4 hex inch shank for use with a drill.The bushing has a small flange that helps keep it in place when sliding the wheel onto the threaded arbor. When mounting, ensure that your shaft's flanges or washers trap the bushing in its hole. The product includes two stamped metal flanges for a 1/2"" arbor but they are very cupped and will not immobilize the bushing.The wheel is well balanced (i.e., no vibration when spinning).Update: Please note that this is not a brass wire wheel, it is a brass-coated steel wire wheel."
2,Will not mount on tapered spindle,"Plastic insert would not stay put, so would not mount on my tapered arbor. Can't use it! Fell dangerously off grinder while in use."
5,SMALL BUT VERY BEAUTIFUL,"MY DAUGHTER IS A BALLERINA SO I THOUGHT SHE WOULD REALLY LIKE THESE, AND SHE DOES! BUT MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THEY ARE TINY! THEY SEEM TO BE FOR A TODDLER. OVERALL GREAT DETAIL AND QUALITY."
3,Almost excellent,"This retelling of the American civil war could be excellent. It has very a good narration (not David McCullough) and contains very good material (not directed by Ken Burns). The story is told using contemporary photographs, film of re-enactments, and scenes from early movies. They are well spliced together and explain the civil war clearly and simply..."
2,"pretty bad, and listing has wrong info","the previous negative reviews are pretty accurate. the listing i read on amazon had the WRONG INFO for the video. it is not 680 minutes. it is 90 min. also, some of the information is wrong. i didn't watch past the battle of shiloh, but up to that point several things were wrong, including names, pictures attributed to the wrong historical figure and even statistics. shiloh had 23,000 casulties (killed wounded or missing) but the film stated that there were 33,000 dead.i can't say i would recommend this to anyone, even if you just want an overview of the war. ken burns doc. is still the best overview, though it is lenghty.there are a lot of better cw video/dvds out there. i hope this helps."
3,"I Wouldn't have Passed without It, but...","I used Sybex's ""big"" book by David Groth and the exam notes book, to prepare for A+. Exam notes definitely had the extra material, which I did not see in Groth's book, that I needed to pass. I do wish I'd passed the test by a wider margin however, which makes me think that Exam Notes, while valuable, could be improved on."
2,"Good Info, But . . .","This book has some great material in it, but it is rather annoying that every Sybex Study Guide always leaves some material out so that you'll have to buy the Exam Notes books as well. There is material in here that you won'tfind in the Study Guide, but which should have been included in it. So to get all the information, you'll need BOTH books. But as far as it goes, the book is pretty decent. Should not be used by itself to prepare for the exam -- it is a review tool, and does not contain enough information to stand on its own."
3,Found a few errors. Otherwise inexpensive and to the point!,This book is inexpensive. It gives a good summary of the course. I have used this book alone to study for the exam. Only on few occasions did I need to look things up elsewhere. I did however find a few errors and hope I caught them all. Thanks.
3,Compatible with Danco GB-1 Replacement Cartridge,"Our faucet began to leak recently, and then wouldn't shut off. I didn't have time to get parts from the manufacturer, as we were without water. I took the broken cartridge to a large chain home improvement store--the orange one ;) -- and eyeball matched the cartridge to one made by Danco (Part number 89902 or GB-1 - not sure which number on the package is actually the model number). Anyway, I was hoping it would be compatible. It is! Saved me buying a new faucet. FYI, the Danco packaging lists it as ""Replacement Cartridge for Glacier Bay Lavatory Faucet, fits models: 169-640 & 231-087). Thought I'd put this out there just in case anyone else was in the same boat."
1,terrible conditioner,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is the worst conditioner I ever tried. The only plus is that it does add volume. But it does so at the expense of healthy hair. Even to apply it is impossible. It simply cannot be worked through your hair. I have very fine, thin hair. As I applied the conditioner and tried to work it through my hair, my fingers kept getting caught in the tangles in my hair. Afterward, I either have to spend a good amount of time trying to comb the snarls out of my hair or I have to apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner just to be able to comb my hair. And while it does seem to add volume, it is so hard to get a brush through my hair while blow-drying that I just give up and go for the pony-tail look. Don't buy this."
2,not great,"This product is not salon worthy. I hate how it feels in my hair. It does not leave my hair feeling weel conditioned or tangle free which was why I ordered it. Save your money, do not get this!"
3,It didn't volumize my hair. . .,"I honestly loved everything about this conditioner. Except the fact that it left my hair looking as flat as usual. It smelled wonderful, and left a nice smooth feel to my hair, but it didn't volumize it. That was kind of disappointing. Maybe it will end up working for you though. Anything is possible."
1,teeeeeeeerrible,"dont get me wrong, im one hard-core spongebob fan, but nickelodeon could do soooooo way much better than this. the graphics r the worst ive seen yet on a handheld game, the controls are horrendous, and the story is just stupid. its such an easy game, and its not fun in the least. do nooooot buy this game. i repeat do NOOOOOOOOOOT buy this game."
1,"Bad Game, Too Easy!!!!!!","This game was a very big disappointment. It's not that it wasn't fun. It was fun. The problem is that it was too easy. I finished the whole game in four hours. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. The next time you play, it's exactly the same. The stuff is all hidden in the same places and the exact things happen in the exact way. There is only one level, it doesn't get harder each time you play. Take my advice and don't buy this game! Watch a Spongebob cartoon instead."
3,"Spongebob is cool, but the game is not","I got this game for Christmas just last year, and i stopped playing a month later. I am also a big fan of spongebob, but I think the people who made it could've done a better job. It's funny that when an enemy touches him he loses his pants, if he touches him agian he loses his undies hehehehehe. But anyway they have the main places on the show like the carnival, rock bottom, jellyfish fields, and so on. I have to admit, the graphics are kinda[unrealistic], sometimes you can't even see where you're going and stuff, and his movements are kinda hard to control, like his jumping. So in my point of veiw, you should just rent it first and see if you like it. DONT BUY IT RIGHT AWAY. This goes for those other cartoon games, like dexter, tom and jerry, stuff like that. I hope this helped. GO LOOK AT MY OTHER REVIEWS!..."
2,Odd controls!,"Who ever designed this game seriously needed some help and playing some action/rpg's wouldn't hurt either. The controls are very odd, and switching weapons(bubble wand, net, etc.) isn't very easy. You have to pause the game and go through three screens. Another part that is really, really, really annoying is you can't just 'save' your progress..they give you a code to re-enter. To all game makers!! Put a battery in the cartridge!! Codes are a thing of the past..we're in 2001 not 1981!! I'm a TRUE fan of Spongebob and this was a real heartbreak. 2 stars just for the name, not the game."
4,Comments,"I really like your site. I think the articles and photos are just great. I would like to make one comment though, why does everyone insist on displaying red letters on a black background? It really makes for distracting reading and takes something away from the program. Other than that, I found your site to be intertaining, interesting and for a novice UFO enthusiist educational and I will recommend it to my friends."
4,I liked it.,"I liked it. The story was interesting and held my attention. It was also easy to read - I read it in one day. I think most of the people objected to it because it doesn't fit into the main story line of the TV series. I didn't have a problem with this. It's a great story, told from differing view points of the characters but mainly Security Chief Garibaldi's. It was lighter than some, but I liked that too after reading ""To Dream in the City of Sorrows"" which was a great book but the story was a bit heavier and took more thought. I think most people who reviewed this book have forgotten about the TV episodes which also seemed to have nothing to do with the ""shadows"" storyline but had almost totally separate and sometimes light-hearted adventures. Anyway, I enjoyed it and I think anyone interested in a light sci-fi adventure would too."
3,A possibly promising beginning but then...,"This book was a bit of a dissapointment for me.The beginning offers the book to be full of either interesting opportunities or huge dissapointments. It was neither.The plot was intriquing and the book kept you with it, but there was not enough pay off at the end, as the author fell back on old, predictable solutions and colorless writing.A nice read but nothing is missed by not reading it either."
1,Doesn't belong in the series,"Although it is nominally set on Babylon 5 and uses the names of various of the characters (mostly unrecognizable from the series, or mere caricatures of themselves), this book really has no place in the Babylon 5 universe. The story is poor, it advances nothing within the B5 universe, and its ""reset button"" Deus ex machina ending violates the entire spirit behind Babylon 5.Take a look at ""Thirdspace"" by Peter David (based on the movie by J.M.Straczynski) to see how this story should have been done.There was a serious slip in quality control when this book made it through as an authorized B5 vehicle. If you like B5, avoid this one at all costs."
2,Jhaeman's Review,"Although I enjoyed the first four Babylon 5 novels, I found this one rather disappointing. The plot is hackneyed and the sort of thing that has happened to the U.S.S. Enterprise about a dozen times. The conclusion is of the ""ambiguous"" type that doesn't indicate complexity so much as a writer apparently too lazy to give answers. Unless you're a B5 completist, avoid this one."
2,I found no satisfactory resolution in this story.,"As the people reacted to their primal, anti-other dreams, the violence reeled from one description to another. I do not believe Babylon 5 would have the resources to clean up the totality of destruction that was described. [Who could really believe the ""Hell's Angels""- type characters would be allowed to bring their motorcycles to Babylon 5?] No viable hint was given as to the character or purpose of the Green Worm. The ending drops like a boulder - or magic wand - with no real weaving together of purpose. I love Babylon 5, but not this book. It could have been done with any characters from any space environment."
2,Nothing really,"This book adds nothing to neither the storyline, the characters nor backround.This book has ""StarTrek the Next generation""-style strange force that causes people to get violent. It is handled even worse than in Thirdspace (movie).There were 2 great thing in this book:1. Kosh gave straight answer(!) ""Yes."" 2. Fermis angels, A religios motocycle gang, that wanted to blow up B5.One a star for both."
1,Where's the Unreal Editor,"Since this game looked like a bad Xbox 360 port (and it was) I bought it totally for the new Unreal Editor which was prominantly advertised on the box as being included. If it was not as far as I could tell. Customer service never returned my E-mail asking about it.If you are looking for a sneak peak at the new Unreal editor, buy ""Roboblitz"", not this sorry XBox port."
5,WRC World Rally Championship Arch Rivals,The WRC is in my mind the finest racing on this planet. I look forward to view 2008 and hope to obtain it from Amazon.
4,Lilias is still great after all these years,I have enjoyed Lilias for over 30 years off & on (more off than on until recently) -- I used to exercise 'with' her when she had an AM show on PBS ages ago. Some of her videos that I have done over the last couple of months seemed a little too laid back & easy -- not so with these. After doing them I feel like I've gotten a real workout & have targetted the areas that I wanted to work on.
5,Love Lilia,I love this DVD. Unfortunately I am unable to use it due to it all being floor exercises. This no fault of the product but due to my not reading the description correctly. I wish I could perform these exercises.
2,Faulty product,"I've had to return the DVD TWICE. It would either hesitate or completely freeze as soon as I started watching it. Finally got a refund and contacted Lilias directly. I purchased the same DVD from them. It still hesitates in a few spots, but it's definitely better that the first two. Obviously not the sellers fault. He refunded me the money for the purchase, but I did have to pay for shipping charges the both times I returned it."
2,Complete Yoga,Not the best Yoga for beginners............repeating the same routine on one CD is not the best learning tool
3,Not my Favorite Version,The story is good but the acting is a bit strange. The parts where it seems I am in some kind of hallucinogenic is not my favorite part but the action parts are nice. It's an OK movie to watch once.
3,A Beautiful Film But Not For All Tastes,"Collin Farrell portrays an explorer who falls in love with an Indian woman and becomes part of her world for a while before she becomes exposed to the ways of his culture.Don't expect a Dances With Wolves epic though,as directed by Terrence Malick this film immerses you in a different style of life but is purposely short on drama and excitement.With all the hustle and bustle of modern life it may be hard for some viewers to adjust to this film's slow pace and to tell the truth there's not much of a story to propell it along.However if you turn off the lights and tune out all distractions you'll be able to appreciate the lush beauty of this film.With no giant special effects this film casts a natural hypnotic spell.The performances are actually decent(especially compared to Farrell's terrible Alexander)but this film's real strength lies in the visuals and the recreation of a time long gone."
3,Jamestown,"The film by itself is rather long, with outstanding photography.The colors and sceneries are just fantastic.However as a movie itself,it was not that great,as there was no conversation,which should have been.After all this is a historic movie,and it did not give credit to the actors.I liked it, but it was not the best I have seen."
2,"They had a movie, why did they screw it up?",I will tell you what this movie makes me think happened. The money ran out...so in a race to salvage this movie they hodge podged it together with what ever footage they had left. Then they had no time to edit so they overlapped scenes with voice overs so you will understand it without any dialogue between characters. It was like a bad french movie and the off the wall questions made it all seem like a 2 hour Obsession by Calvin Kline commercial. I did like the cinematography however but whoever put this story together missed the boat. I saw all the pieces for a great movie underneath all the pretension so why didn't they make it?
2,Wasted opportunity...,"This movie could have been fascinating. The lead actress was well cast and the camera loved her. The scenery was gorgeous. The story, or fable in the case, is an interesting one. With strong characters this could have rocked. Instead, this movie is puzzling at times and incomprehensible at others. I watched with two other people and we kept having to pause the movie and ask what was being said. It was very hard to understand. The editing was just weird - the first cutaway made us think our DVD player had malfunctioned, and I actually rewound to see if it had skipped anything. The characters had no names, and no development. Just a wasted opportunity. I'd advise anyone planning on viewing this to use subtitles to help understand the limited dialog."
4,A Question,hi i have a question i've never seen this movie before and was wondering is it sad in the ending does pochahontas marry john smith in the ending is there even a john ralf in it thanks!
2,Disappointing,"A dull retelling of the Pocahontas story. The whole movie is rather strange without much really happening. It was, however, nice to see them get away from the more stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans. The only saving grace is the cinematography--plus, I like Colin Farrell. Overall, a big disappointment."
1,Buy British!,"I loved the film, so I wanted the DVD. I bought the US version from Amazon, but rashly didn't do enough checking. The US DVD is 135 minutes but the British version is 150 minutes!!!. So for some reason the US DVD is cut/edited/censored. US consumers lose 15 minutes of film.My US version is now in the trash and I have ordered the British DVD. This great film should be seen in it's entirety not censored by New Line. So, buy British (from Amazon UK of course!)."
1,Crammed a 1 hour movie into 3 = BORED out of my mind!!!,"This movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of Christian Bale and Colin Farrell to date. It was boring, overblown and incessantly long. It's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better, but it never does - and then it just ends. Don't waste the time or the money."
1,A travesty,"The only redeeming quality of this film is nice cinematography, thus the one star. It is historically inaccurate, boring, poorly acted, trite, a deserved failure at the box office."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!!!,"This movie was bad! I wish I didn't have to watch the whole thing but it would have bugged me to not finish the movie once I started it. It was sooooo long it felt like it was 5 hours long. If you typed up all the dialog in this whole movie it would probably only fill up two pages, I swear it went for like 45 minute with no speaking except for some voice over which I could barely understand for they were talking to slowly!!!Please avoid this movie!!!!!!"
1,Cinematography is like a giant perfume commercial...,"Do you remember the old perfume commercials from the late 90's and early 2000's where there was over filtered landscapes with some woman whispering a single word lustfully? Well turn that into a 2 hour movie about John Smith's travels to America, and you'll have an idea of how this movie feels."
2,so dissapointed...,maybe as as dvd where u can watch an hour at a time but sitting through this yesterday drove me crazy.
2,Must be in the mood for...,....a beautiful two and a half hr slideshow. With heavy classical music overlay. While showing Native Americans. General synopsis: Colin Farell's hair blows in the wind. Pocahantas's hair also blows. Some people die. Others have boils. Pochantas looks down coyly. Colin Farell's been fake-tanning. Alot. There's water. And sky. And trees. And snow. Batman arrives. The end. 10 minute black screen and silence before the credits role to fully ponder the master piece.
3,Disappointment,I was really hoping for a much better film but this one let me down. I kept falling asleep through it. Boring.
1,Insulting,This movie is not historically accurate. At all. I realized pretty quickly that this film should have been boycott as it does not tell what really happend to Matoaka (Pocahontas' real name). This film is no more accurate or less offensive than the Disney version.
1,The Worst Movie I've Seeen in a Theatre,"I had to force myself to stay awake, then I had to force myself to remain in my seat. I was wrong on both counts. Sleeping or exiting would have been better than watching this! Almost nothing happens in this movie, and when it does, it is either off screen or in the background. Sure there are some lovely nature shots while voice-overs recite poetry, but I've seen better on PBS. Please, avoid this movie!"
1,Absolutely horrible ...,"This movie had lots of potential, but the director simply blew it. The whole movie felt like a never-ending sequence of Calvin-Klein-a-new-fragrance-for-a-man-and-a-woman commercials to me. If the same movie had been directed by someone with 2 beans worth of talent, the whole story would have been told in about 30 minutes. Do yourself a favor and pretend this film had never been made."
2,If you are having trouble sleeping....watch this movie!,"I saw the previews for this movie and could not wait to see it. When I finally watched it, I was completely disappointed. I admit the music was beautiful, but the lack of storyline made this quite boring. I actually fell asleep several times during the long 2 1/2 hours."
2,Must be viewed with a grain of salt...,"I just saw this movie, and was expecting more action and dialogue. It took me two days to get through it, as I was very disappointed with the storyline, (if that's what you call it.) Of course, there was little historical accuracy. Pocahontas was just a little girl, about 11 years of age, when John Smith arrived on the continent. He never fell in love with her! She did marry John Rolfe, had a little boy Thomas, and went to England, where she died (20 or 21 years of age) at Gravesend. The authenticity of the costumes and sets was good, the photography fabulous. I just wish they would have cast a different actor for the role of Captain John Smith. Colin Farrell was just not believable. This movie could have been so good! I heartily recommend the book, Pocahontas and Her World, by Philip L. Barbour, for an excellent take on the history of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. It is a 'must have' book!"
2,Not impressive.,"Colin Farell has done some good acting before, however in this one he was particularly off key, as was just about everything. As to Mr. Farell, I am not entirely convinced he has sufficient scope of ability or demonstrative emotional range to become a leading legend as his previous demonstrative 'shines' have previously confined themselves to the dark, introverted typecast and support actor scenes such as when he basked fairly ingeniously under the floodlight of Cruise. As to the movie - This is a good example of a movie where all parts effectively conspire tragedy upon the sum - production (cookie-cutter), music (bland to match the plot I suppose), dialogue (ho-hum), character (cardboard), narrative (ineffectual bandaid), plot (petty) and acting (lukewarm is a compliment). Accolades to the tatoo artists, though I suspect the style doesn't reflect historical context and style, and it doesn't particuarly matter.Moral of the story- take the ""Two Thumbs Up."" with a BIG grain of salt."
5,In response to G. Wayfer,"I think it's unfair to discount the opinions of those who disagree with you by pasting some judgemental picture based on what the reviewers seem like. If a movie doesn't grab somebody, it might be the viewers fault or the film-maker's fault. Movies are supposed to entertain. And reviewers are supposed to critique the movies, not the other reviewers. You said yourself that each has his own opinion, so don't go trying to cheapen other peoples'.Sorry to those who wanted to read this and learn about the movie."
1,pollyanna-disney-tripe,"Yeah, the movie was pretty but didn't it disgust/infuriate anyone who knows that the romance between Pocaho (little girl & not her real name) and John Smith(old man imperialist ahole) is a total fabrication? And why is it that she's revered when she threw her own people under the bus? it's revolting but I guess the reality doesn't make for good entertainment. yuck..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I saw the previews for this movie and instantly wanted to watch it. I finally rented it when it came out on video and honestly regret it. It was a waste of money but more than that, a verrrrrry long waste of time. The story being told was great, it's just the way that it was being told that annoyed me. Thirty minutes into the movie I started wondering ""Is it going to be like this the rest of the way through?"" ""Is anything exciting ever going to happen?"" and so on. Basically, The scene shifts can get a little confusing and the movie as a whole was very uneventful and tiresome. Very lame."
1,Calvin Klein commercial at its best.,"When I saw the previews in theaters for this pic, I wanted to see it. It must not have played long in theaters because I rented the DVD a couple months later.After I saw the DVD I now know why. BORING! What a waste of excellent actors, gorgeous scenery and great costumes. Maybe they should have hired a writer and director for this flick instead of a poet.This movie had so much potential, and I watched the whole thing thinking it would take off and get better. Instead I got a 2 hour Calvin Klein ""Obsession"" commercial from the 90's. You remember, the ones that showed a man and woman doing something artsy-fartsy with weird camera angles and pointless voice over dialogue. The only difference was that the commercials were shot in black and white and this movie is in color.There are very few movies I hate, unfortunately this made the top of this short list.I give this one star for the actors, location of the shoot and the historically correct costumes."
1,Boring,The story started off quite good when they arrived at the Americas. But then it just got boring. The actors were almost wooden. The lines they said were bad. If you were tired and wanted something to put you to sleep. This would do it.However the pictures of the country side were nice.
4,A beautiful tone poem,"Visually stunning film with little dialogue. The power of this film lies in evocative imagery and the wonderful performance of the young actress who plays Pocahantas. Not a film for the multiplex crowd, and that's another reason why I like it."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"The good: the cinematography was (for the most part) beautiful.The bad: The abrupt scene changes remind me of raw footage and is distracting. I understand there's an artistic element here, but when people's lines nearly get cut off, it's annoying. The voice overs were difficult to hear without turning up the volume. Must everything be whispered?The pet peeves: Colin seemingly has one expression: furrowed brow and darting eye. Pocahontas' native dress reminded me of a porno version of what Native Americans might wear: off the shoulder and mini skirt. The soundtrack repeated so often that it become a sort of nightmare. Pocahontas spent way too much time running through the tall grass.Summary: This movie really let me down. I had hoped for an epic film about the new world; instead, I had to watch a sketchy, rather abstract picture of a love affair between Smith and Pocahontas. This movie does not make my list of ""watch agains."""
1,DVD Quality,This product did not perform up to the standards that I feel are acceptable. This DVD stopped severals times and completely stopped a couple of times. I feel that this particular DVD is an inferior product.
1,Desecration of a Beautiful Film,"There is a reason why copies of this edition of ""The New World"" are selling for $.32, and buyers who are not savvy deserved to be warned. The original release shown in theaters was 172 minutes. This disc has a cut version, 135 minutes I think, which, believe it or not, seems much longer than the longer version. In the theater, 172 minutes passed like lightning, because its pacing was exactly appropriate to the near ecstatic experience which Malick set out to convey. If you are at all interested in this film, go for the longer version. If you care for film as an art, you will be well rewarded for your time and money."
2,TEDIOUS & BORING,"People go to movies to be entertained which Malick keeps forgetting when he directs his ""pretty"" pictures. Yes, he is a masterful cinematographist but a boring director. This film is all about long, boring snippets of characters thinking out loud. Do we really need these voice-overs ? Actors are supposed to act either through their voices or expressions. Viewers don't need the director's voice overs to translate their feelibgs. The film is slow moving and confusing. The editing is atrocious. Acting is so so. Everyone seems to be in a perpetual depressed state - just like I was after only 30 minutes....I sat through it all hoping its pace would change but no luck. Luckily I didn't waste 12.00 but only 3.00 renting it. Malick should rethink the way he makes movies because I'm sure they must all be money losers."
3,Oh It's A Very Long Film,"The cinematography is excellent, the script disappointing. Music score so so. Acting is fine, but the story is so very very long and one sometimes finds it hard to keep an interest on what's happening. It has shades of ""The Last of the Mohicians"" a much better film. This is definitely NOT an action movie. At it's best an ok love story. Best to rent than to buy."
3,It's a graceful but not engaging world.,"The scenery is naturally lovely, and poetic. That's the greatest strength of this film. Half of the movie is about the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). The trouble is I do not sense any love between them at all. Even though the director took a lot of time to depict the chemistry between them. It's more like reading the biography of Pocahontas.It's worth renting not buying.Ghost is still the only title on my list of Best Love Story movies of all time.."
2,Very slow,"For the most part, this is a very visual movie. It is very slow but if you like historical fiction and have the patience, it's ok"
4,"Interesting, sometime touching, but not what we are used to.","I can see where some would think this an outstanding film, others a dreary, drawn out disaster. It is not what we expect from a ""settling in America"" love story. It is beautifully photographed and, often, well acted. It tells a story fundamental to the myths of America and tells it well. Yet, it makes no concession to the rhythms of American film-making, the expectations of an American audience. It is slow, even when events are dramatic, the film is not; better, it is dramatic in a measured way with the drama implicit in the scenery, the walk, the glance. Frankly, I watched it over a period of three days, able to enjoy it only in a series of segments, one at a time. So, judge what kind of viewer you are before ordering this for an evenings pleasure."
5,outstanding,"Without doubt, even the 135 min long version was already a masterpiece. The extended version of THE NEW WORLD is far beyound any description. Especially the now different structure of several chapters emphasizes now more the lyrical character of this outstanding film. Firts of all it is a quite different film than the shorter version. The 171 min-version as well emphasizes the miracle of Q'orianca Kilchers performance. How her face changes in the film, from a teenager to a /still young but almost very mature ) woman is one of the great cinematic events in this decade. Malicks fourth masterpiece proofs as well that the cinema of Terrence Malick belongs to the sacred places of world cinema today."
2,A HISTORY LESSON ON FILM,"One can't deny the visual beauty of Terrence Malick's films. His camera captures glorious vistas, and beautiful lighting. I found THE NEW WORLD, however, ultimately a dull, laborious history lesson. Too much use of visuals, stilted dialogue, long unnecessary scenes, repetitive in nature, and even the action scenes seemed lethargic and unimaginative.Q'oriana Kilcher's performance as Pocahontas is the strongest one in the film; she has a stunning presence and uses her silences effectively. Colin Farrell seems lost in his role as John Smith and Christian Bales and Christopher Plummer are lost in their brief roles.The movie is too long and tedious, and not one of my favorite recent films at all."
3,A Poem of a Movie,"I saw this on DVD, but I wish I had seen it on the big screen, since it is so visually beautiful, like all of Terence Malik's movies. The way to enjoy this movie is just to suspend all expectations of narrative drive or realism and enjoy it as a visual and musical poem or dream. It's the Pochahantas story again, with Captain John Smith and John Rolfe. The portrayal of the Indians is so incredibly romanticized and stylized that anyone with an historical sensibility will be offended. The English settlers, on the other hand, are demonized as savage, brutal, and stupid: a ""politically-correct"" reversal of the traditional stereotype, but equally stereotypical. The acting is OK, but we have the most conventional romantic heroes and heroines. I almost felt like I was watching a harlequin romance. Just accept it for what it is. If you're looking for narrative drive and realistic characters and actions, look elsewhere."
1,Is there a rating less than one star?,"If there was a no star rating choice I would give this ZERO stars. Bad, Bad, Bad. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw this in the theater and only watched the whole thing because I shelled out the 7.50 to see it. Stay away... you have been warned!"
1,Power Glove,"Had two different Power Gloves Had big trouble with both of themSecond glove they said, changes were made. Worked for a short period of time.Than messed up. Good idea bad electronics"
1,Mallick has the uncanny ability to turn gold into lead,"Reprising his glorious capacity to take a subject of great interest and turn it into the most boring film on earth, just like he did for the battle for Guadalcanal in his version of James Jones's classic ""Thin Red Line"", Mallick has taken the story of Pocohontas and James Smith and turned it into a very boring, tedious, unoriginal, slow-moving, unengaging, uninteresting, --did I mention boring? - film.I'll give it one-half star for cinematography. Other than that, this film just basically sucks, big time."
1,"Ouch, am I at School??????","Rented this movie, Ouch lost my money on one of the worst films that was in the store. It was rated PG-13 for intense fighting scenes. Where were they? Oh I guess I could have missed them while I was sleeping. Now I expect it out of my father, falling asleep while wathcing a movie but this one put the whole family to sleep. Take my advise unless you need a good nap don't rent/buy this movie."
3,"A tale of love in an untamed, beautiful wilderness","This film is based on the true history of the English explorer John Smith and his romance with the young Native American girl, Pocohontas. First of all, this movie was more like a montage than anything else. There is very little dialogue and storyline. It is made up of mostly long, dragging scenes of water flowing, grass waving, and Pocahontas walking slowly in the forest.Although I was massively bored by this film, I have to admit that it was a gorgeous sight. The untamed American wilderness was exquisitely shot, and the tone of the film is highly stylized and artistic. This film was quite an accomplishment.In addition to this, the new actress Q'orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas, is absolutely amazing. Her acting is hypnotic and engaging. She does a phenomenal job. It's hard to believe that she was only 14 at the time."
4,For fans of Malick,"I've only seen this film once, in the original 150 minute version released in selected theaters for 2 weeks. This version has 15 minutes of footage cut out. It was promised that there would be a 180 minute version on DVD, ""the director's cut"", and now there doesn't seem to be enough interest! So if you want at least the original 150 if not 180 minutes released, send an email to New Line and tell them so. They said they would likely release one if there's enough interest.I can't add too much about the movie on top of the other reviews, save to say that if you really liked The Thin Red Line, you will love this. It has the same meditative quality to it, and a similar subtext. If you hated the Thin Red Line, and prefer movies by, say, Spielberg, then stay away."
3,just a dream,"This is a fascinating group of visuals but not really what most people would regard as a coherent story. Perhaps the overall image of a fevered dream is an attempt to put us into the mindset of the colonists. But for me the only thing that just doesn't work is the prominence of Wagner and Mozart in the soundtrack. Sure the Wagner piece is about water but its really distracting. I can't imagine Horner would have chosen it so the director must be a huge fan of Wagner's music. Worth a look, but not as good as it might have been."
2,Beautiful scenery but not much talking (more of a pantomime),"The movie was okay but had to follow the actions and body language throughout the entire movie to not get lost. The beauty of nature was astounding! There was a story! Just not to much verbal communication. I got lost several times but I can't even understand what happened at the end? Ahh, did she just die like that?"
2,Dreary,"The self-indulgent brooding is just suffocating. It is nicely photographed, notwitstanding the director's over-use of gloomy, overcast days."
2,Disappointed,"Not many new movies intrigue me to go out and rent them, but I had a lot of expectation with The New world. I read some reviews that praised the director's effort. I'm all into nature and meditation so I thought I would like this movie. Unfortunately, I didn't like it at all. I could not relate to anything in this movie. It tried to make something emotional and meditative out of Pocahonta's first love for John Smith, but it was pretty bad effort. The theme was the innocent and pure first love of Poca, and it just didn't work."
5,Lush and Romantic,This was a beautifully filmed movie. The acting is exquisite. The romance is epic. Enjoy...
4,a fantastic journey between two nations,"it begins with a fascenating opening, just nature photography with a thoughtful score and you hear not a word , the first 10 mins. is a blessing though. i,ve seen Disney,s Pocahontas it was excellent as a family entertainment but this film is superb in every way ,it takes another turn in pocahontas, life with such believable acting and fine direction. the photography wins in this one . you should see this one if you liked the thin red line because it has the same atmosphere though."
2,"Had somebody else directed, it would've had potential","The cinematography, costumes, sets, and the acting for this film is top quality. I love historical movies and I was expecting a lot from this one which deals with the early English settlement in Virginia and the encounters with the native Indians, particularly Pocahontas and her tribe. The problem with this movie which overall greatly ruins it is the artsy fartsy artschool dream sequences which make up a large portion of the movie...maybe if I was a dope smoker (or 10 years ago) I'd really dig this one but obviously there's a reason why this movie bombed at the box office while others of similar historical nature such as Braveheart, Gladiator, The Patriot, etc. were huge and have remained classic films...artschool tactics and dream sequences bore most people to tears."
2,No Words,"I really wish I would have read the above reviews before going out and buying this DVD. I feel like I was robbed of $20! I really wish I would have rented it first. I enjoyed the scenery ( I am from Virginia) and I always like Colin Ferrell however, with so little dialog between the actors made it very hard to follow for me. I kept thinking it was the end of the movie and then later I was hoping for the end of the movie! Just rent it if your are curious!"
2,"slow, slow, SLOW","Could have been a great movie, had some wonderful performances, but the plot was so plodding that much was missed between the snores. I really can't reccommend this unless you want to watch some scenery."
3,I really wanted to love this movie...,"...but it was lacking something throughout. First off, I think that Colin Farrell was not the right actor for this role. However, I enjoyed Christian Bale and was more interested in the film when he came on, but unfortunately, that was toward the end. The actress who played Rebecca (or Pocahontas) was wonderful. Next, I think the story line was also lacking somehow. There was never a sense of suspense, and I was never completely drawn into the movie. The scenery was beautiful, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the film was a bit slow. It was like watching March of the Penguins without the Penguins. :o) The movie wasn't terrible. I did enjoy it, however, I think you would definitely have to be in the mood for it."
2,Boring. Boring. Boring.,"Oh my gosh. Could this movie have gotten any more slow, dull and boring! Every single solitary scene was dragged out forever and ever. And we're talking scenes where Pochahantis and Collin are doing nothing more than walking in a field. Not saying anything. Just walking! Then the next scene could be of her looking at a butterfly with her voice over. Then his. Then hers. Pleeeze. It was painful.The dialog, what little there was, was hard to understand due to poor audio quality.Frankly I don't know how the actors made it through to the end without falling asleep. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the beautiful scenery."
2,Overblown and disappointing,"Having looked forward to this film , I was most disappointed . It was an indulgent exercise is wistful coveting for a 15 year old indian ""maiden"" . Boring and overblown - sort of an early American version of Death in Venice , but at least having a heterosexual angle to the relationship , not Dirk Bogard looking wistfully at an effete school boy ."
5,Simply Poetic,"All of Terrence Malick's films are poetic and 'A New World' is no exception. As someone who grew up near the Jamestown/Williamsburg area for 26 years, reading, hearing and visiting the historical sites of Pocahontas have always been my favorite since childhood. Of course, there is no way we can 100% prove that John Smith was exaggerating the truth in his journals except for maybe bringing him back to life. Besides that point, Malick did a wonderful job of portraying his take of the infamous historical couple. I watched the 150 minute version before it was trimmed down to the 135 theatrical run and sad that it's the version they are planning to release on DVD. Hopefully, the director's cut will also be available. If you absolutely loved this movie, make sure you buy the 150 minute version."
4,The REAL Pocahontas,"The New World, is a great interpretation of the accounts of the famous Native American princess Pocahontas. Though the film still uses the romantized versions of Pocahontas' relationship with John Smith, the film is very dramatic and tells a great story. Though it felt like slow moments in the film, it was counter balanced by the natural beauty of the scene locations present in the majority of the film.It's a great buy, especially for history buffs."
4,The New World,I enjoyed this movie very much. The scenery was beautiful and I appreciated the camera work. The simplicity of their love was perfect. They didn't need words to communicate. I think a lot of people could learn form their relationship.
4,AMW,this movie gets 4 stars because Pocahontas is hot and the acting was good. The dialogue and atmosphere was very poetic. I was not satisfied with the ending but I'm willing to overlook
1,Bunny huggers xmas come early,"Its all in the title chaps, don't waste your time, have another beer and relax............. boring, the stuff of hairdressers dream......... forget it."
1,One big sucky Obsession Commercial - Too Artsy Fartsy,Half the movie was nature sceens narrated with wierd deep questions. Even my wife did not like it.
1,THE TIRED OLD WORLD,"MUNDANE.......MAUDLIN..........PROSAIC......no dialogue........no character development........no cinematography..........no sets..........no narrative..........no magic........no nuttin'........add this dreck to the american pantheon of ISTAR, HEAVEN'S GATE, and YENTL..........yuch........."
1,Beautifull to watch but that's about it,"What a big dissapointment this movie was. From it;s opening credits it was shot beautifull and I loved the way the camera moved and the scebery but that's about it, that's the only good thing about this boring, no acting film. The acting is horriable there isa ctually no acting the actors stand around and deliver there lines, but what lines there is hardley no talking in this film. The story is long and has no life to it it drags on and on and on. Overall beautifull to watch but it dosent make this movie come close to being good."
1,Love Affair Movie,This movie had very little to do with the discovery and making of the Jamestown Fort. The majority was focused of the love affair between Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell)and Pocahontas. I guess the promo was correct because it did say it was a romantic. Sure wish it focused on the discovery of Jamestown more. I don't recommend this movie.
1,This is a horrible movie,"Man, was I let down by this. Opening up a high school text book and reading about Pocahontas is 100x more exciting than watching this movie. It's a good story but Terrence Malick has absolutely no idea how to tell it. This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen."
4,comfortable!!,"These sheets are not only warm and soft, but feel so comfortable. You will enjoy sleeping on them."
2,"Great at first, but didn't last","I loved these modal sheets so much when I first purchased them that I came back and bought another set. Then after just 2 washes in the delicate cycle (cool dry), they pilled very badly and also lost their soft, shiny texture. Not recommended."
2,Don't waste your money on these,"I have two sets of Bed Bath & Beyond's modal sheets and love them and thought I might save some $$ buying these. Ha.Like others have said, they just don't fit a standard mattress, much less the extra-thick ones that are being sold these days. I can't get the fitted sheet even close to the bottom of my mattress. I ended up giving the sheets to a friend with an older (thinner) bed and she said the sheets eventually gave out at one corner, likely from being stretched so tight after several washings.I'll go back and buy more BB&B; sheets, thanks."
2,Sizing is way off,"I agree with the other reviews that the feel and colors of this set are remarkable. But that does little good when the fitted sheet won't fit onto the bed. As instructed, I pre-washed the set before putting them on my queen bed. Obviously, the bottom did not fit and popped off easily, and did not even cover the sides. My mattress is 6-8 inches thick, not a deep-sided one. I believe it was a double bed, not a queen size, though the top sheet was almost ridiculously long, so I know it was not totally mis-sized. Either quality control is sadly missing at this company, or the shrinkage rate for this fabric is unacceptable. As I say, this did not seem to be the case with the top sheet and pillow cases. What is most irksome is the difficulty of returning items purchased from Amazon.com. Part of my criticism is how exasperating and what a rip-off the whole process is. I will probably not purchase items from Amazon Marketplace again."
5,Superb quality and feel,"These sheets are the best sheets i have ever used, once you use them you will never go back to anything else. My husband and I did not move an inch all night they were so cozy. Additionally, we have always fought about the top sheet and i always got the short end of it. Not with these sheets, the top is so large that it covers way more than the sides of the bed. Highly recommended.After about 4 washing the sheet starts to pile."
3,Doesn't work for cake,"I have made three cakes in this pan and there is no way to get the center of the cake done without burning the edges. Things do bake faster, but the edges are done long before the center, and the net result is a partly ruined cake, whether you go for a done center or perfect edges.It is a beautiful pan, but it still requires nonstick spray coating to be easily cleaned. For cake, it's back to the metal and glass pans I've been using for the past decade or more."
5,Great gift!,This was a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it!This show was shown on PBS back in the 1990's and was a popular weekend treat. The first five seasons are the best.
5,VERY nice condition!!!,DVDS look brand new and the price was great! They came in the mail quickly and tracking them was easy too. Thanks alot these are for my sister for Christmas and she will love them.
5,Best English comedy!,You can watch these episodes over & over again. They show people as they really are! Reminds me of many I have met & been around in my life. As American as it is English!
4,Flush Free Niacin 500mg,"Excellent price for the big quantity. Even with shipping, the price was still lower than the big box ""club"" stores."
2,Niacin,"Years ago when I was taking traditional niacin ""nicotinic acid "" I wouldsuffer with intense flushing for two to three hours. Then I discoveredNiacinamide and flush free niacin and been taking it for many years now.Alas, I just learned from a Doctor that the nicotinic acid blood levelreaches only about one-tenth of the traditional niacin on a milligram-for-milligram basis. Taking an uncoated asperin 30 min. before takingniacin could help to deduce flushing. I can't,I am on coumadin. What to do? Do I take more of the flush-free Inositol Hexanicotinate? How manymg.? I am confused"
2,"Electric erasers are wonderful, just not this brand!","The price looks too good to be true, and it is. This is definitely not the best bang for your buck as far as electric erasers go. First off, the battery compartment is very difficult to open, and you risk breaking it just trying to put batteries in. Second, the button you push to operate it is rather difficult to push, so you won't be able to erase for long without having to take a break. It might be nearly impossible to use if you have arthritis. The mechanism used to hold the eraser is also difficult. I broke the metal piece trying to pry it open to get my old eraser out.I strongly recommend looking at the Sakura or Staedtler model instead. Here is a video which reviews the Helix, Sakura, and Staedtler erasers: [...]"
2,Dont have a Use for it,the eraser keeps sliding into the nose and you have to pull it back out. Cant see a use for this thing because it chews up paperlike other erasers. Ill stick to the kneaded erasers as they dont harm the surface of the paper. This thing just weighs down mypencil bag.
2,not as good as I expected,"Hello, everyone! When I was looking for the eraser, I didn't need anything special, so I decided to get the cheapest. Well, I was rather upset, when I tried to erase something written with regular HB pencil. It was smudging... badly. It has 2 types of eraser: white and gray. Both of them smudge. Maybe, if you change the eraser (use the one that you rely on), it'll do the work in a proper way.Second characteristic is that it's less comfortable than the one by Staedtler. The good thing about it is that it's compact and light... and cheap.I really believe that, if you change the eraser itself to the better one, it can perform much better (the way you want, maybe), because the motors in these electric erasers are almost identical.Best wishes!"
4,Used Correctly...,"Used correctly, this is a perfectly fine cordless eraser. I have had mine for 8 years without problem. If you have problems with the eraser sliding into the unit just adjust the metal sleeve. If the batteries are wearing quickly or you have burned the motor out, then you are bearing down much too hard. This is a tool for a specific purpose, erasing medium to light lines! The rotation means you don't have to press down. If you need more power, then a corded model is probably the ticket."
5,Keeps Husband busy,"Bought this for my husband for his bday and he enjoys it everyday. I see a difference in his waist measurment. Looking good babe!! People say its not portable, well once you attach it to the door way you want, you cant move the hooks but you can move the bar off."
5,works as expected,"I am happy with this product, we just leave it up in the entrance to the kitchen, it doesn't get in the way and I do 5-10 pull ups every time I pass under it, that adds up, its also great for inverted squats and crunches and my girlfriend has a bad sciatica nerve pain from a car accident that historically has plauged her, even cortisone shots worked for only 2 months, but hanging on this makes her feel better right away and for a long time, it has pretty much fixed both her and mix back problems, without adding to clutter and adding in a workout as well. I very happy with this product, its solid and is what they say it is."
4,Very nice! but the gravity is still there.,"EZ-Up Inversion Rack With Gravity BootsPro's:- RACK: very easy to use, easy to dismount for regular use of the door frame, good grip.- BOOTS: firm hook grip on the bar, I don't believe putting it on and off could be easier (but it still takes over a minute to put them on ""comfortably"")Con's:- RACK: not portable (mounting brackets screwed to the door frame three 2-inch-long screws each)- BOOTS: not really comfortable, but one has to keep in mind, that you cannot cheat physics, and the gravity IS still there, pulling the weight of your body down. The only thing constraining are the shoes, with half of one's weight at each foot base. In my opinion the foam should be either thicker or less deforming, and/or the boot shell could be better profiled to distribute the load on a bigger area.Just be prepared for some pain until you'll figure out the right boot setting for yourself ;)"
5,Great Workout!,"The rack/inversion boots are worked into my son's daily workout routine. Well made and easy to install, the system is great for an out of the way door frame."
1,did not work for me. difficult to install,"Deserate for back pain relief , tried everything. This did not help unfortunately. I found installation to be pain . Maybe the other teeter that is self standing is better."
3,"ok, but......","-a little hard on the ankles when hanging for very long-it's not due to cusioning, that's sufficient. it's shear body weight and gravity pull."
5,A great classic,This is probably one of the best PS 1 games out at the time it was made. i would give it a 5 out of 5 it's a great classic withok Graphics for a play station game.
4,Anime Lesbian ...... Assassins with Assault Rifles. Hurrah!,"Graphics are wonderful for PS1, and still hold up pretty well on the PS2. Voice acting is top notch. Plot is rich, and very different (gotta love that Japanese weirdness). Controls take some getting used to. Inventory system isn't the best. All in all an excellent game for adults. Challenging and very atmospheric."
5,"Great Story, Worthwhile Puzzles","After having played the first FE, I bought this game without ever having read a preview... a first for me. This game has something no other ""survival horror"" game has, logical puzzles. Despite the huge amount of puzzle solving that needs to be done, all of the puzzles seem organic and really fit into the story, rather than the contrived feeling of the Resident Evil series. Match this up with tons of action and a story that beats Metal Gear Solid (although it's sexual insinuations and graphic-violence in the cut scenes may be a bit much for some). In short, if you loved the story and interactivity of MGS and the creepy action of RE, this is a musy buy."
4,GREAT ADDITION,THIS COOKBOOK IS A GREAT ADDITION TO MY LIBRARY. I COOK SALMON FREQUENTLY AND HAVE USED THIS COOKBOOK SEVERAL TIMES AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOMES.
5,Balanced and Accurate,"Neeley's saga depicts the life of the man who led the last free Comanche tribe from the Texas plains into the modern world. In one lifetime Quanah successfully bridged centuries and cultures. A chasm so vast that Quanah is the only native American Chief that truly made the transition. Son of a captive girl, Cynthia Ann Parker, and son of a Chief, Peta Nocona, Quanah is a man who is truly unique in every way. Neeley's account of this man is fantastic."
1,Worse and worse,"The US needs to get a life and balance; at one time any book mentioning a Native American just about had to contain the idea of ""bloodthirsty"" or ""sneaky"", even if the Native American was an old Navajo woman weaving blankets. Then there is this superficial mess, which extolls Quanah Parker to the point where you wonder if the man ever burped.Yes, it has a long and hairy index quoting sources, so you can be impressed (not). Yes, it gives an account of the man's life in the same superficial way as a history text from high school, mentions only Adobe Walls as any real confrontation, and more than half of the thing is devoted to the 'statesman' portrait Neeley attempts to draw of a man who had to sell out -- whether to save his people or for his own advantage is something you have to judge for yourself, as Neeley keeps trying to make him out as a 'statesman'. This book is insulting to the intelligence of almost anyone, never mind the Native American Indian.pat chapin[...]"
1,Displeased with Seller Customer Service,"I never received the product. The seller said they shipped it and that I failed to select ""insurance"" for the shipment so they could not replace it. I have never seen this option when buying from Amazon. If it exists, I wish it were promoted, or that Amazon would make it more visible in the purchase process."
2,Vitamins,"I bought thesebecause they are lower in sugar. However, they taste terrible so my kids will not eat them. Not cherry tasting."
5,Curious Buddies are great!!,"My kids (16 mos and 4 years old) both love the curious buddies. My son loves to listen to the music and dance while my daughter now knows the words to all the songs and the movements that go along with them. The entire series is a nice set that my two children can enjoy together. Curious buddies is a educational dvd that teaches without sounding like a drill instructor. Vocabulary is repeated throughout the video, but not drilled. We now own the entire series!"
5,A no-nonsense realistic perspective of daily life even under the most extraordinary pressures,"Illustrated with a handful of black-and-white photographs, Just Call Me Moose!: Growing Up Italian In America by Karl R. Bossi is the haunting memoir that follows the author from boyhood in '50s Boston, and the terror of his father's suicide, to the jungles of Vietnam as a member of a bomb disposal team, to civilian life. Over the course of fifty years, he learned that it was impossible to live fully as long as he shut out the reality of his father's death. Just Call Me Moose! is filled with dialogue straight out of the author's memories, and a no-nonsense realistic perspective of daily life even under the most extraordinary pressures. Highly recommended."
5,The story in each of us.,"This is a great story about one individual's journey through life. From the endless freedom of youth, through the tribulations of growing up and having to take life serious. The experiences Karl writes about brought back memories of my own, and I'm sure will touch on some of yours as well. From the hilarious to the extremely sad, it's all there like the story in each of us."
5,Mr. Humphries I Love You,"This is absolutely my favorite British sitcom, and I have volumes 1-4! I am so excited because this is another of the British sitcoms taken off of my PBS station when it was sold! I can't live without Mr. Humphries, he absolutely made the show, in my opinion of course. From Mrs. Slocum to Mr. Lucas, this on of Britian's greatest! I can watch each episode again and again! Thanks to the seller and to Amazon for selling this to me! It came to me in perfect condition!"
4,The major themes of peasant fires,"Peasanta fires is an interesting, imaginative account of the pilgrimage of Niklashausen. Richard Wunderli has done a good job of recreating the story of Hans Behem and the pilgrimage of Niklashausen in 1476. The ever-present and extremley important themes that run throughout the book are that of pilgrimage, indulgences, and social classes. Although some of the story is the imagination of Wunderli himself, he clearly explains the story of Hans Behem. This novel is a useful tool when studying the history of Germany in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is not the usual reading material that one would find when learning about history. Nonetheless, it gives a different perspective than that of a usual textbook."
2,"Feh, I dunno guys","I'm a student of history, a professional investigator, and a writer. Just to lay out my credentials. In the end, after reading numerous imagined stories and that one particularly troublesome sermon that the Author created, I wasn't sure if I was reading history, or historical fiction."
2,Hard to grasp,This is a quality product that is less than marginal. It was hard to grasp. I would recommend this product.
2,"... actually, that never really happened.","Relatively common 15th century German micro-history: Peasant claims visions. Peasant is burned alive. A fascinating topic, and more so per the specifics of this case; unfortunately marred by Wunderli's approach, including a several pages long imagined sermon, which saddles this otherwise intriguing effort like a wet blanket."
1,More junk from Breyer,"Once you cut the thread-ends off the badly-sewn pad, you can watch this saddle disintegrate when you put it on a horse. The stirrup straps are made of cheap leather scrap that you can easily pull apart with your fingers. The stirrups themselves are not properly attached and one fell off. The saddle itself is crooked (sits at an angle). The metal fittings are cheap pot metal that come apart after a few minutes of using the toy. This is absolute junk."
5,Best Kept Secret,"Honestly, I'd never heard of this lady in my life. My father mailed this cd to me and it was AWESOME from the 1st track to the last. I don't know why it's taken two years for me to hear such an anointed woman. I am waiting on her next album and it has to be soon."
1,Junk,"Put the corn in, took it to the woods, thing would not work. Sent it back. Can't get another one. Looks like a good Idea but needs a lot more quality."
4,it a good starter feeder,if you are looking for a feeder that is cheap (not made cheap) this is a good starter feeder. I wanted a feeder that was easy to setup and if stolen easy (cheap) to replace. I'm happy with it and I look forward to using it again next year.
5,automatic deer feeder,I bought one of these feeders 2 years ago and very pleased on how long the 2 (9 volt) bateries would last. It feeds twice a day and clock keeps feeding times almost to the minute. When i saw these 2 for sale i had to buy!Hold 50lbs.of corn and can be concealed and weatherproofed. Also throw wheel can be adjusted for more or less corn dispensed at each feeding. You cant go wrong with this feeder!!
4,Red Dwarf 8 leaves us drooling for 9,"Ok, i still do not like Chris Kocanski. i just love the bantering between the 4 boys. but, after such a long wait here in the US, the 8 series has satisfied me for a few months. not as good as the earilier series, but still full of laughs, and worth the money to own."
2,Light Reading,"I think the book is over priced. Finished it in two days. Interesting only from the standpoint that Chrysler was a pioneer on a few items. Since Mr. Breer died in 1960? the automotive technology has exploded, so many of his statements are now not relevant."
2,too silly..,"A bunch of aristocrats with long and silly names run around playing at James Bond in cravats. If Regency Romances, excruciatingly detailed accounts of attire, and sentences like: ""The tall man with the dangerous eyes knew that someone was going to die tonight"" flip your skirt; with a little bit of that ol' pagan magick, faeries, gypsies, tramps and thieves thrown in for good measure, this book is for you. The only vaguely interesting character I encountered before I gave up on the book altogether was one Rupert St. Ives Dyer, Captain His Grace the Duke of Wessex [ouch, huh? you think that's bad.. everyone else has at least five more names.], a sort of Jim West/Lestat in tasseled riding boots. Maybe someday I'll go back to the book and see what kind of wacky and off-the-cuff espionage that dashing Duke is up to for the rest of the story, but I doubt it.. maybe if I'm in the mood for a little Duke from UNCLE, or a good chuckle.."
4,Delightful! Cries out for a series of sequils.,"All the other glowing reviews are true. As much fun as Suzanne Frank's ""Reflections in the Nile."" I have read and liked Andre Norton all my life. One of the greats keeps getting better."
5,As Amazing & Enjoyable as The Scarlet Pimpernel!,"This was one of the most amazing books i have read in a long time! My two fav stories in the world are George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel."" I'm a real science fiction/fantasy person. So naturally i was overjoyed when i saw this book. i wasnt disappointed at all! There were many diferent characters with intruiging personalties, mystery, romance(i would have been happier with a bit more romance, but under the story's circumstances it wasnt possible), magic, suspense...everything you could ever want was right here in one amazing book! Also, an 'alternative history'is an amazing idea. i just loved it! i highly recommmend this book to everyone - it's a true masterpiece!"
2,Disappointment,"I really loved the author's scifi novels under her other name. I looked forward to this one because I love old fashioned romantic novels, but what I found was a messy beginning full of unnecessary flashbacks. Once those end, the story gets going, but it's not ""Jane Austen meets the Scarlet Pimpernell."" There is no Jane Austen and no hint of Wordsworth, or Byron, just a lot of Georgette Heyer slang and characters. Including the heroine and a lower class girl getting on a first name basis in a public shop. Elizabeth Bennet never showed that kind of vulgarity. Why not make up a world instead?"
5,A short picture book,This is a very short picture book of the VW Iltis. It contains very little information. Being the only book about the Iltis how could I say anything bad about it!
5,Short picture book,"Hi, this is a very short book of pictures of the VW Iltis. It contains a small amount of information about the Iltis. I would have to say that being the only Iltis book I have found how could you say anything bad about it!"
5,Beautiful -- well worth owning,"This is one of my all-time favorites -- Tania Libertad's strong, clear voice is at its best in this recording. Although some of the orchestration may sound a little dated (this album was first released on vinyl about 20 years ago) the musicianship is superb. Even if you don't speak Spanish, you'll probably enjoy the music; the melodies are beautiful and there's some lovely guitar and piano work, too. If you enjoy Latin American music, this CD is well worth owning."
2,nice but....,I bought the bracelet expecting the stones to look like amethyst. Unfortunately they lack color and almost appear like a very pale rose quartz. It is well constructed and comfortable. Thats about all I can say about it. I was not pleased with this purchase.
2,Inconsistent color,I purchased 3 of these bracelets. The stones in 2 of them were very light which made the bracelets look extremely cheap. The third bracelet had darker stones with just a few lighter stones mixed in. It was much better looking.
3,Happily Received: A Sterling Silver Amethyst Bracelet Review,"I found this sterling silver amethyst bracelet at a great low price, so I bought several for gift giving. The bracelet comes in a small gift box and includes a storage pouch. The amethysts are a pale purple, providing subtle contrast between the stones and the sterling silver.When I first saw the bracelet I thought the stones were way too pale. They certainly aren't as deep as the image suggests. However I sent a couple out to family members as birthday gifts. Many in my family have skin issues and react negatively to plated jewelry. The both recipients loved their new bracelet.If I had bought this for myself I would be unhappy, I would expect deeper color in the stones. As an inexpensive gift the receiver has no preconceived expectations, both family members were excited and raved about their gift. For my purpose, this sterling silver amethyst bracelet was perfect.PROS:Nice giftSterling silverCONS:Pale stones"
2,"Pale, mismatched stones make it look cheap","I got this bracelet at a very low price, and still, it's not worth what little I paid for it. The stones are terribly, conspicuously mismatched, ranging from pale lavender to nearly clear with a hint of pink. Some of the stones seem cloudy and don't sparkle at all, even in direct sunlight. On the plus side, the setting seems sturdy and the clasp is secure. The silver has a nice polish to it. But the poor-quality stones ruin it for me, so I'm returning the bracelet for a refund."
3,Extremely thin,"I had seen the negative review on this bracelet before ordering, and so my expectations were low, and it did meet my low expectations. The bracelet is very thin, about 3 mm wide, and the stones are tiny though they have a good shine. They don't look like amethyst, more like transparent cubic zirconia, with a very light pink hue to them. The bracelet is comfortable and nice. Definitely not worth the $50 price tag on it. You can get similar looking bracelets in stores for $15."
3,Fun for a while but a game with NO depth is destined to fail,Crazy Taxi 2 is fun for a while but when you either beat the pyramid or become upset because its too hard to beat then the game will slowly make its way to the bottom of your collection.It has great graphics and tight control but the music is a letdown and my aren't those cab drivers crude. The game is a welcome addition to any Dreamcast library even if it will eventually get old.
5,CT2COOL,"I honestly didn't they could get much better than the first Crazy Taxi,but somehow they managed it.The graphics (especially colors) are better gameplay is improved and I love the new crazy pyramid.I think on the next one they should let you get a bus or a tank or maybe even an airplane."
3,A good sequal,"Crazy Taxi 2 is a lot of fun if you have never played the first one. But it is so muhc like the first one it is kind of boring if you own the first one and then you buy this one. There isnt much of a difference beside new mini games and you can now jump over on-coming traffic. Also there is a new map to drive in since it is in new York. There are four new people al lwith different cars, but who cares? My advice is spend a lot less money and get the first one because tey are both very alike."
2,Really disappointed...,"I loved CT1 and was really looking forward to CT2. Unfortunatly it didn't do anything for me. I found the characters less interesting than 1, and the biggest let down is the track/city. Not nearly as fun as CT1. All the hills and jumps in 1 were great. CT2 maps also feel smaller than the maps in CT1. The added gameplay elements don't do anything to enhance the basic gameplay- i.e. jumping cars. Picking up two customers is kinda cool but I wish you could pick up ANY 2, not just the same ones together."
3,It's Crazy Taxi but doesn't live up to the Original release,"I got this earlier this week and have been playing it. Good notes about the game are that it's easy to play, and has the same relative functionality of Crazy Taxi and Crazy Box but in a different setting. And there are added challenges and features to this game. If you like Crazy Taxi, the original, you will enjoy this sequel's game-play.However what was lost was the ""charm"" of the game, in the new characters. BD Joe's slang is missed. As were the voices of the Conservative drivers. Now they all pretty much sound the same and are really kind of flubbed. Even the young kid with the urban accent and the preppy girls voices. So that is what I miss about the game. Otherwise it's quite entertaining."
5,DA BOMB!!,"This is one of the best games for Dreamcast I've ever played. The graphics are awesome, and the mini-games are fantastic! I love the songs, yet they get a little annoying after a while. I'd say that this on is better than the second one."
5,How much Crazier can it get?,"This is a great to sequel to a great game. It has even more features then the first one. In this one you can make the car jump. There are different drivers and a different city. The excitement is just as crazy as the first one and you'll have a blast jumping over cars and landing on them too. The graphics stayed the same, but the gameplay is even better. This game will provide you with many hours of crazy driving."
5,Awesome Game!!!!!!!!,"This is the best taxi gme ever. Yes it is better than Simson's Road Rage. The graphics are unbelieveable. Even though Dreamcast has died this game rulz. New York, New York is awesome. There are many things in this game that are in NY and they actually look exactly like thereal thing. There are some things like the Brooklyn and manhatten bridges, City Hall, and even Yankee Stadium. So if you looking for some Crazy Drivin' buy this game."
5,"A great strategy, driving, and fun game","This game is one of the best game I ever played and I never got bored of it after 4 months when I bought it. Even with 2 levels, it doesn't get boring and the levels are huge so you feel your in a city with lots going on. This game, you get to break traffic laws without the cops. You can drive on pedestrian areas, cut through traffic, and drive underwater. If you like strategy games, this is a great one because you must memorize how to get to each location like a real taxi driver plus using shortcuts to get to places fast to satisfy your customer. You also get tips if you drive in style with swift moves and dropping your customers in style. But all I have to say is that this is the best driving game for people who like to explore places, drive crazy, and think. So buy this game and it doesn't get boring like most games."
3,So boring,"The graphics are spectacular. That's it. Nothing else is going for this game. You'll enjoy it for maybe 20 minutes, then you'll regret having bought it. The game has no story, little extras, and is incredibly repetitive. Oh, and the same Offspring song is played over and over nonstop. Yeah, that's not annoying.Visual/10Audio/5Fun/2"
4,Almost the same game,"The first Crazy Taxi was a great game. The graphics were smooth, the scenery was beautiful, the gameplay was fast and exciting and the controls were great. This game is nearly the same as the first. The drivers are different, there are more special features, you can pick up groups of passengers and your car can jump. These additions do little to make the gameplay better. What I had hoped would have been most improved was the levels. Unfortunately, there are still only 2 and they aren't nearly as attractive as those in the first game. Also, they are mostly flat and all you can see are unbroken rows of tall buildings. If you already have the first one and you want more, get Crazy Taxi 2. If you're trying to decide between them, get the first one."
4,Its ok.,You get 4 new drivers and you race in NewYork not San Francisco. You get to have some fun with the new crazy pyramid not cube from the first. And i like the pick up 234 feature that lets you earn more money. But i hate how its just like CT1 I mean it is almost to simalear. But it was so much fun the first days and it still is today but it just gets older and older every day. I only reccomend it for people who have never played CT1. I love number 1 it was fun and i thought this one would be so much better but its not worth the fast buck that Hot D brings up when you pick him as one of the drivers.
4,bundles of fun,"This game is awesome! If you thought the first one was great, then get a load of Crazy Taxi 2. There are a lot of new and fun minigames. The music by Offspring and Methods of Mayhem is great. There are all new characters to choose from and they all have their own unique cars. The flow of the game is the same as in the first one, but now there is an all new jump function that will allow you to jump onto low buildngs and over the traffic. The best part is that it is in NYC. There are a few landmarks that most people will recognize right away. All in all, this game will be fun for the whole family."
2,VERY DISSAPOINTING!!,"I WAS REALLY JUICED WHEN I HEARD THAT CRAZY TAXI 2 CAME OUT, BUT VERY DISSAPOINTED AFTER I PLAYED IT.BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST, SAME GAMEPLAY , SAME EVERYTHINH, EXCEPT FOR HARDER TIMING, AND DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.BEEN THERE! DONE THAT! TIRED OF IT!"
3,whatever,"crazy taxi two is know better than the first one.The only thing different about crazy taxi 2 than the original is you can make your car jump and you can also pick 2,3,4 people up instead of one,and last but not least this crazy taxi takes place in new york not san fransisco.but for people who have never played crazy taxi and whant to play you will have a load of fun with the original or the second one.Pretty much both crazy taxi plots is just picking up as many people in a certain time limit and seeing how much cash you can get.And like i said its fun but you will soon get bored of picking up people and trying to earn cash"
4,One of the best games ever!,"Holy [crud],whoever does'nt like this game should be sent to death.This game has the BEST soundtrack EVER(on a game). Pick these killer charicters either this guy without a shirt,cool haired guy,Cimonin,and this funky old man. The game gets a LITTLE boring after a while get this game if you liked the Simpsons Road Rash(But CT2 is better)and you like the Offspring(the band)."
2,socks for him,These socks are nice thin wool. However they did wear out rather fast.... Guess it depends on what you want them for... heals and toes.. gone. Not for everyday use.
3,"Not as warm as expected, but versatile","You buy wool socks for one reason, really: warmth. These socks are not 100% wool, but I didn't think the small percentage of polyester would make such a huge difference. I am comparing these to 100% wool socks which are usually about twice as thick as these thin socks are.However, these socks not being as thick can work to their advantage as does the color. In a situation where regular wool socks would not be appropriate (i.e. with dressier shoes) then these socks are a nice compromise between really warm wool socks and just plain cotton socks.If you want big warmth, I suggest other socks (that are gonna cost more). If just somewhat warmer than cotton is okay with you, these socks are cheap enough to give a try.Warmth: Two stars.Versatility: One star.Total rating by me: Three stars."
4,Wool Socks,A bit thinner then I expected but since I do not have any nice thin wool socks these have worked quite fine in most instances.
3,start out good but..,they get holes in them too easily. NOt as durable as WigWam (but a lot less money too)
2,worth the price,"These socks were inexpensive. You get what you pay for. Don't be a tightwad, and spend a little more. They're socks, and socks are one of the most important and most taken for granted articles of clothing. These are uninspiring. I think wool, and I think warm. These ain't warm. They're thin and they stretch out easily. wouldn't buy these again. In fact, the whole catalog of the company was full of cheap, cheesy stuff."
2,Ight 1st CD,"Yo this muh cuz cd, i gotta support him in this.... He prduced it by himself wrote and everything.... its koo for something he did on his own... it has a couple of tracks i like on it.... He is gonna blow up though AlAbAmA UnDaGrOuNd!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Yes, they've all done very well!","Are You Being Served? is one of those rare TV series that achieves sheer perfection. The characters are so well drawn, the ensemble cast so over-the-top magnificent in their portrayals, that the laughs begin with just the slightest hint of what is to come.I'm so happy that I can now escape to the world of Grace Brothers Department Store on DVD! (I am free!)"
3,OK Buy.,"This printer gives you exceptional quality. It's handling of text documents is flawless! And you too will think it wonderful until you run out of coloured ink and can't print a thing even though you have an almost full black cartridge. So once you don't run out of one ink and you can handle a little noise when printing (OK more than a little), it a good buy for the price. I probably would have bought something else if I'd known about these little quirks beforehand."
2,status,"this item have been broking yestarday 19 may 02, i traied to cencle it from here but i can not plz be awear about that."
1,Marketing for the 777 is misleading,"The Epson 777(i) will accept only Epson OEM print cartridges. Epson has installed a chip in its cartridges that defeats the use of aftermarket cartridges. I believe this is the sole function of the chip.None of the advertising I have read discloses this attempt to force printer owners to use only Epson cartridges. The sales people with whom I spoke concealed this (or they didn't yet know about it).The issue is the expense of Epson vs. aftermarket cartridges. My daughter, a student, uses approximately two cartrides every two months....Buying aftermarket cartridges [is much less than replacing with the OEM cartridges] with the same resulting printer output.Had this been disclosed, I would have purchased another model such as the Epson 880 or another brand."
2,"Worked great , then went to crap",I got this printer brand new at CompUSA 4 years ago for only $40 (a new store opening celebration). It worked great until I put a generic cartridge in there. All it did was streak and clog the heads. When I finally found a cartridge that worked the gears and belts went to crap!! The estimate for repair was $60. I threw the printer out a 6 story window.
2,too much ink,The printer is slow the ink cartridges dry out fast.No were in the instructions did I see that the printer should be turned off or the cartridges would dry out.
1,Noisy black ink guzzler printer,Color pictures are rendered very nicely but the black ink replacements will kill you. Got one free with my computer but the paper feed was broke so I was sent a replacement. I have burned through five black cartridges and one color cartridge in a year and I don't print all that often. The printer is quite noisy when it's turned on. When you print a page it makes a lot more noise picking up the first sheet of paper and preparing the ink nozzles. I am printer shopping again after this expensive mistake.
1,Read this before you buy,"Ink jet refill printers are great because you can buy inexpensive refill kits. But the 777 is not worth buying because their ink cartridges have connectivity issues. Ink refill kits cannot be successfully used with the 777. Enter ""ink refill kits"" into any search engine and you will see many companies that sell such kits. 8 out of 10 refill companies will not specify kits available for the Epson 777. Also, if you are a windows 95,98,or ME user, you will have to download new drivers because the software that comes with the printer is now officially buggy. Check out epson.com and see for yourself. I am a Windows NT user, and I have to turn the 777 on and off again three times before I have to print anything out. The 777's printing quality is very good, but the ink maintenance costs WILL be high, and the printer itself is certainly not as stable as other ones out there. Spend your money on $150.00 range-printers for more something more stable."
4,"Epson ,dependable ,colorful","Not knowing much about printers I bought an Epson 777 ,upon a customer service recommendation.It was inexpensive , so what did I have to loose ?Would I ever take a reccommendation fron that company again should it have been a dud ?They had more to loose than I.Well I'm glad I bought it .I've been given many compliments on my pictures ,T shirts ,and articles.I'm always asked what kind of printer I have because they say my pictures are better than theirs.And I mean a substantial amount of people looking to buy a printer like mine because of the results.It seems to print a little slow to my likings but I'm never pressed for time and I do like it. It does help to use the right paper for the right printing task however ,and the results will be superb."
2,"Poor Print Quality, Brutal Ink Usage","I purchased my Epson 777 from a local store about a month ago, and though I print very few sheets (under 100), I've already had to replace the cartridge once. Midway through the next month, I see that the cartridge is half empty after only 40 more sheets.Not only does this printer use up ink at an obscene rate, the print quality is extremely poor, even for a printer at this price range. The cartridges constantly clog, and the software constantly crashes.This product feels flimsy, prints at abysmal quality, and sucks down ink as fast as it sucks dollars out of your wallet. Unless you fancy the idea of paying double the printer's purchase price in ink every 4 months, then I suggest you look elsewhere.Rating 2/5 stars."
3,"...it's the ink, stupid","Good quality, noisy (I can live with it), but no bargain. I've spent twice the purchase price in ink cartridges in no time at all. Also, if one of the cartridges is empty you can't print even if you only need the other cartridge. Next time I'll look elsewhere and check the ink cartridge price/availability first . Epson, are you listening?"
1,An absolute waste of money,"I'm an 8 months user. Price is cheap & quality is excellent. Yes. The catch is it eats a lot of ink. And they are not cheap. No generic ink replacement available. This not the worst yet - if say the color ink is finished, even though back is still available. This printer won't print ! STUPID design !!! (or rather this is a smart way to drain your wallet). It creates unneccesary down-time. Actually my color ink became dry because I didin't use it for 5 months. Then I have to waste $30 to buy new color cartridge JUST TO MAKE the black ink prints !Beware - first time users will be impressed by this printer, but wait until several months. Better still, just don't waste your money on this machine.Other model like Epson 880 could be a better choice if you want to have generic ink replacements."
3,SLOW NOISY INK GLUTTON,"This printer came as part of a computer package deal so I didn't actually pick it out. It WORKED fine & dandy for 2 years, the speed & noise were no big deal. Expensive ink is just the nature of the beast with inexpensive inkjets!Then it suddenly conked out & no amount of new drivers, (very little) help from maker, or reinstalling would work.Repair would have been $90 just to LOOK at it, so I said forget it & bought an HP1209 3-in-1 for $79!!When it first stopped working, the trouble lights indicated low ink (though I print rarely & it had nearly full cartridges)But I bought 2 new ones which of course didn't help & I now have 2 sets of no use to me that will only fit Epson 777 or 777i models. Wish I could unload them REAL cheap on someone whose 777 or 777i still works!!"
2,worked for less than 9 months,"After spending the summer wrapped up in its box my son's 777i doesn't work anymore - the print head can only move 2 inches to the left. The troubleshooting guide says I should contact Epson to get a replacement but given how inexpensive printers are now and the fact that my son needs a printer for school I am not sure what to do. My investment in cartridges for ONLY this model exceeds the cost of buying a new unit, but I am considering buying a more reliable machine, less I face this situation every September!"
3,Epson Stylus 777 Printer...,"I bought this printer as an accessory to the computer I bought when I went to college last fall. After setting it up and printing only several pages, it suddenly failed to perform print jobs. After looking through the manual and not finding a reason for this, I went to the Epson website and found that I had to download a different driver for the printer. The printer worked fine after this, but it was annoying that this problem occurred after I had taken it out of the package only days earlier. Another complaint I have is about the ink that corresponds to printer--this thing is an ink monster. I needed to replace the black ink after only 3 weeks (I print about 15 pages a week), and its ink is not cheap. It's also quite noisy, and I find that the vertical tray that is supposed to support the paper feed is inadequate--I often have to feed it myself. The upside of this printer is that it prints fairly quickly and the quality is very nice--when you have enough ink!"
3,Disposible Printer,"I was able to pick this printer up for 50 bucks at the local Office Depot. The pictures printed aren't bad, but the ink doesn't last long. And if you try to buy ink, it costs more to by the ink then it does the printer. Therefore a disposible printer. You CAN'T refill the cartridges. A little microchip counts the amount of ink spat out and turns it off even if ink is left in the cartridge. I recommend spending a little more for one that you can refill or one that lasts a little longer.It was VERY easy to setup. No complaints on actual use. I was a little harsh earlier, the pictures did look nice."
4,Good but noisy.,"As far as printing quality goes, this printer is great! I've used it to print regular black-and-white text and it works great. I've also printed out pictures that I have scanned and pictures I've taken with my digital camera. The picture quality is EXCELLENT as long as you use photo paper and set the printing quality to Photograpic. It does consume ink rapidly, but what can you expect when you're printing images? Aside from that, it makes a great deal of noise when it's starting up, and randomly when it is about to start printing. Still, this printer is very good and does the job right."
3,"Amusing, informative but not much of a mystery","I enjoyed this for the information about Twain, riverboats, late 19th century America. The mystery is fairly obvious (or maybe I'm just congratulating myself). A laid back, humorous tone throughout. Young Cabot is modeled on the quintessential mystery straight man, Dr. Watson; eager, interested, a little dense."
2,Only Twain makes it readable.,"While Heck creates a decent Twain for his book, the rest is a sorry excuse for a mystery. An obvious villain and an insipid narrator make for a painful read. If not for a decent grasp of Twain's general demeanor and commentary this book would have been unreadable. A good idea but the execution does not make me want to see if the author grows into a better mystery writer."
2,Save your money!,"I found this mystery to be boring and obvious. The reader is hardput to like any of the characters, especially the protagonist. Heck deliberately writes the character as a dolt, but he succeeds so much that the reader cannot sympathize with such a naive, whining wimp.If you is interested in MarkTwainology, then I guess this is the book for you. I have little interest in riverboats, and the book seemed to ramble about them considerably.The mystery was the worst part of the book. It was obvious from the beginning what was happening and how it would unfold. Heck dropped so many early clues that I almost didn't finish the book. I have to wonder if he really thinks that readers are as obtuse as that! I was terribly disappointed in this book and would not recommend it!"
2,Disappointment,"Quality was good, but I was very disappointed with the style. The chronographs were so small there's no way you can read them without a magnifying glass."
3,I wanted to be bowled over,"I read all these great reviews, so of course I got the book. It's good. I like that each hero has two pages, and the book is thought-provoking.But it's slanted...These (mostly) _are_ good heroes to admire, but be warned: this book includes the despicable Rachel Carson, responsible for untold human misery and death due to the banning of DDT and the resurgence of malaria.I prefer the Childhood of Famous Americans series -- the books are more in-depth and enjoyable, and more politically neutral."
1,Carson and Carter?,"Rachel carson is responsible for the deaths of millions. Mostly black children in africa, as her ridiculous book silent spring led to the outlawing of DDT the most effective way to kill disease carrying mosquitos.Jimmy Carter supported Kohmeini's taking power in Iran, leading to the slaughter of more Iranians in his first year than the Shah had committed in his entire reign. Kohmeni also created the suicide bomber and instituted strict islamic law, removing the freedoms and the pro-western culture the Iranians had previously enjoyed. We now face crazy Achmadenajab acquiring nukes thanks to Carter. These authors have a strange definition of hero."
5,Good reading.,"Richard Smitten does an excellent job of portraying Jessy Livermore. He does not protray Mr. Livermore as a hero or a goat, just a man.The book is easy reading and is very insightful to the frailities of a successful stock operator. It also discloses the principles by which Mr. Livermore built his wealth, and lost it. Good job Mr. Smitten."
3,This is very interesting story,"I found the story intriguing. Learned many bits and pieces of this amazing man's life I had not known before. My only issue: this is so poorly written it made a great and compelling story so very hard to read.In these days of economic turmoil, it is good to be reminded that the financial world always is and always has been volatile. Leaves me musing over who might be the Livermore of our day."
2,Very Interesting Life Hurt By Poor Writing and Editing,"Jesse Livermore had an extremely interesting life. It is too bad, then, that Richard Smitten's biography of Livermore was so poorly written and edited. Smitten has the extremely bad habit of telling us in advance of major events in Livermore's life so that when we get to these events chronologically we have generally been told about them multiple times. Also, there are many references to people where names are incomplete or where a nickname is used and then noted on a later page. The best parts of the book concern Livermore's trading and his rules and they make the book worth readng despite its many weaknesses."

3,"Lightweight & large, but handle is short","This shovel is lightweight and should make it easy to move a lot of snow. However, the handle is short which forces taller people to have to stoop and bend when using it. When I say taller, I mean 5 feet 5 inches or more. That is my height."
3,Flimsy No Name Shovel,"I had hoped this shovel was more like (it looked like anyway) a shovel I already own but its a cheap knockoff. It is very light so that's good for those who don't like heavy objects but the blade is very thin, has no leading edge of metal, so I don't expect it to last more than one season. Another great product from C. Its only use will be for as a deck shovel for fresh snow, I wouldn't recommend this for use anywhere there is heavy wet snow or ice stuck to walkways."
2,snow shovel,Ames snow shovel - I am giving the shovel only 2 stars because even with spray the snow sticks to the shovel. I purchased it because it was very light in weight and snow would slide off easily. It is light but I have others that are just as light. So I now am using my old shovel over this one.
3,Haircutting scissors,"The scissors are good, most people would like them just fine, but I had an earlier pair, and liked them better, and couldn't replace them."
2,Sega..........What have you done?,"When I first played the demo for this game I was pretty excited, but when I got the game I was immediatley disappointed.If your expecting a remake or similarities of the first game, let me just say think again. All you do is select your side (Hero or Dark) and play the scenerio and get all the emblems plain and simple. Besides that the camera angles are a mess you'll get SO frustrated with them. Finally this game is very plain and simple I personally beat the game (without all emblems) in two days but its all how you play. If your a hardcore Sonic fan buy it but expect to be disappointed."
2,Why Sonic Team?,"Taking a first look at this game about 6 years ago, I wanted it.I put it my my DC and was not very happy.Yesterday I picked this game up from CoolRom and was not happy today, either. First problem was it Wouldnt save my Chaos!.On a genuine and a copy!When you start of the game you can either pick hero or Evil.What about picking your Charecter like in SA1 was SO HARD?Well no mather what you choose, its the same objective.Collect rings and get to the end.How original.Sonic and Shadow stages are fun, but they RARELY POP UP!It shouldnt be called SONIC adventure 2.It should be called SONIC AND FRIENDS adventure 2!Tails and Dr.Eggman stages are fun and cool.You get to shoot at enemy's which is nice.Then FINALLY there are Knuckles and Rouge's stages.These are completly tidious and challenging.They are not fun.The controls for them are slippery.The camera has been a problem in every Sonic 3D game.But this....is god awful.I would recomend getting it off CoolRom insted of waisting money."
2,Not So Super Sonic,"This game is a game with a good story but the character of Shadow was totally un necessary, if there should be a good/bad sonic it should be Sonic nd Robotnick not Sonic and Shadow. Fun but bad character development kills it."
2,Sonic,We bought this game when we purched our Dreamcast. This is the least played game that my daughter plays.
1,Sonic Adventure 2 IS THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have been a Sonic fan since I was 2 and I am now almost 13 and this is the biggest disappointment of my life as a Sonic fan. I should know because I have every one of the Sonic games in existance! SA1 was much better; you could choose your characters and it was much longer. They reeeeeeeally pushed the rival limit with them. This is was the worst game ever in Sonic history!
5,this game rocks!,"when my little bro bought this game i though it was stupid.But when I got a chance to play it,it turned out to be the best sonic game ever.I also like how you can be good or evil."
4,Its pretty good,this is a great sonic game but definately not as good as sonic adventure 1 i mean this doesn't even have adventure parts but still its a great game to own
5,It only Gets Better,"I first saw this game on Tech TV an have played the demo. I did not think Sonic Adventure could get any better than the first but I was so wrong. The graphics on this game are undescribable and unthinkable. The levels are much better and so are their plots, stages, and missions. The place that had the most improvement was the Chao homes. They are just unbelievable. I'm telling you now if you like action, long game play time, extreme graphics, and getting your money's worth then this is your game. This is a definite buy!"
5,Super!,"This is number one! It's like Sonic Adventure with adrenaline. It is totally worth the [price]! It is fast, fun, and challenging. The whole setup and gameplay is only a little different from the first one."
5,a good game,"I think this was a good atempt for sega to make money off sonic adventure 1. Grafics are great, game play is great, but level transition and set up could have been more like its predicessor. Great intro to sonic 3D, 2 player competition, the best yet. The characters are over animated in cut sceens. it is still a great game, just not up to my pre set standards."
2,This one really wasn't that great...,"My goodness... all these five star reviews really awe me... I've been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars. Sonic Adventure one was very fun game to play, but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed. Those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title. I didn't give Sonic Adventure 2 a 1 star review because many people,including my own brother enjoyed this game. It also had a decent following.On a personal level however I feel they kept all the flaws from the original game, took out all the previous positive changes, and slapped a title on it. I was very disappointed. If you own the dreamcast I'd recommend getting the original before this one."
5,Best Sonic Game ever,This new game has a great plot and an overall score out of 10 would be ten. This game is really addictive because when you starte playing you can't stop playing until you are done.(I am an expert gamer)
5,The hedgehog shows no signs of slowing down,"I've actually had the game since June(actually, I got it the day it came out. Hah!),but I never got around to writing a review. I can pretty much describe the game in one word: incredible. The graphics, music, levels, storyline, overall ending, all leagues above the original. Even though the camera seems worse than in the first one, it never spoils the fun. If you're a Sonic fan and don't have this game, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???!!! BUY IT NOW! Do whatever it takes! Sell blood, pets, toys, your little brother, anything! This is one purchase that you will never, ever regret."
4,Sonic Adventure 2,"If You've beaten Sonic Adventure this is the game for you. With great graphics, great music, and all new characters this is one awesome ride. But for those of you who have beaten SA1, E102 Gamma, Big the cat and Chaos aren't in SA2, Amy is, but you can't play as her. Hope you enjoy the game :)"
3,ultra sweet game,This is the best game ever! you will have hours of fun playing this ultra good game.
4,"IF YOU ARE PICKY, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!","This game litteraly stinks when it comes to graphics! I give it four stars**** because of the graphics! (But since that is one subject I take away one star). I mean, Eggman and Sonic DO NOT LOOK LIKE THAT!! But if you count plot, characturistics, and the new stuff (Sonic and Shadow doing somersaults, and grinding, Tails and Robotnick using homing missles, giant robotic legs, and being able to use Robotnick in a Chao garden, Evil Chao, and Hero Chao, Evil Chao garden and Hero Chao garden, ect.) All of that is a great gift to us from Sonic's 10th birthday. So if you are a person who dosn't need and backround and starts the job and likes to learn about other charactors special stuff and don't care how stupid they look, this is the game for you! (you would also be a good spier!) ^ ^ -"
4,Images,"I think Sonic adventure 2 is a four star game**** because of the graphics! I mean, Sonic does not look like that! And Doctor Eggman > <! The story-line I give two, the plot one and a half and I . give graphics a half. So, if you like stories, not a big plot person, and don't about scenery, this is the game for you!"
5,Sonic Team does it again!,"Remember those old Sonic the Hegedchog games for the Sega Genisis? I do, in fact Sonic 2 was my first video game. But what about the new one? Well don't worry 'cause this one blows every other game away. The Good: Fantastic graphics, larger levels, and even more missions than Sonic Adventure 1, blowing away it's predisesors 150 emblemes with 180, which are almost impossible to get! And yes, those cute little boggers the Chao are back!The Bad: Nothing except beating the story mode is too easy."
3,The jewel of the eigth season...,"...but unfortunately, that's not saying that much.In the 8th season of it's wonderful, zany run, Red Dwarf seems to have lost much of the magic. Even the return of the brilliant Chris Barrie could not save the overall flat tone.However, if you love Red Dwarf, Byte 2 will provide you with some laughs. I like the introduction of psychotic Kill-Crazy, and Kryten's sexual identity crisis (he is classified as a woman due to his incomplete anatomy) makes me howl. Cassandra and Krytie TV are great episodes, and watching the Dwarfers play basketball is classic. I wouldn't pass this one up, but I would say it pales in comparison to the earlier seasons of Red Dwarf."
3,Sadly there is very little choice for the CCNA WAN Switching,"Part I of the book gives a good grounding in WAN technology. However, Part II can be inconsistent, providing varying levels of detail across the various products. Some WAN concepts are assumed knowledge, which isn't helpful if you are new to the area or come from a LAN background."
4,Easy to follow,This video is perfect for a person just starting yoga. The instructor explains every move. The movements are easy to follow. Very relaxing and you can really feel your legs working.
1,if only i could give it zero stars,"I paid fifty cents for this book after being told that there were sly references to Dave Eggers (Mike Yoke in the book) and Douglas Coupland (Canadian writer Darren Cooper!).I want my fifty cents and four hours back.Carla Sinclair has managed to write a dull, unbelievable story about inconsiderate, useless people. The dialogue was flat, the plot was insipid, and the ending was trite.Jim is an editor at the ultra hip tech culture bible of a magazine, Signal. (He's a spineless pencil pusher.) Kat is an intern at a zine, and feels that the world owes her more. Her sense of entitlement throughout is appalling.She drunkenly gambles away $200,000 on his computer never quite apologizes.This book isn't even worth any more of a review.... just stay away from it."
4,"Fast, highly enjoyable novel","Once I started reading this book, I really couldn't put it down until I finished it. The main character, Jim, is somebody I started out hating because he is such an arrogant simp, but I ended up rooting for him. The other characters are great fun. I don't know if the book accurately portrays the ""multimedia gulch"" scene, but the book was so good I didn't care."
3,"Sinclair tries to imitate Coupland, but falls on her face.","This was a mildly entertaining book, and a fast read, but throughout, I couldn't help but notice the author trying to copy the style of Douglas Coupland. The plot was interesting and offered plently of action and tension. On the other hand, the dialogue was downright clumsy. I'm sure that Miss Sinclair is a fine non-fiction/magazine writer, but her dialogue sounds like she spends all of her time in chat rooms."
2,"It's cool if you're in the scene, but will anyone else care?","A great novel could be written about the multimedia artists and computer industry workers that congregate around San Francisco's South Park. Unfortunately, this isn't it.I had fun playing ""spot-the friend,"" but before too long that got old and I was left with a not-too-original caper story marred by a few too many unbelievable coincidences and a way too pat ending. Sinclair is a decent writer, and the multimedia scene is a good setting for a book, but there was too much wrong with this sotry for my to suspend my disbelief and get involved with the characters."
5,aptly titled,"Shiver is the best and will be the best album released this year. The Sabians have the total package. Thunderous precussive mastery (Chris Hakius), infectious bass (Rachel Fisher), surreal guitar sweetness, (Patrick Huerta) and emotional, searing vocals (Justin Marler). This album is most aptly named because Shiver is exactly what I do every time I listen to it!Let's hope 2004 sees another release!"
1,Will not print desired number of copies,"I have asked Olympus tech support to tell me why this printer will not print the number of copies I send though to the printer. After six weeks, three calls with hour long waits and voice mail messages, I have had no response. Very disappointing. Time to move to Epson."
1,Let the Buyer Beware,"Olympus should take the time to print out these comments and make it a resolution to have engineering, the tech manual writers and customer service become familiar with the problems associated with their product."
5,olympus camedia digital color printer p-400,Absolutely love this printer. It is so easy to use and the results are amazing. We printed some of our favorite pictures and put them right into frames. It looks like a truly professional job. We have given prints to family members that don't believe we did them ourselves. The only complaint - is to plan ahead - the printer ribbons and paper are not carried most places - so order ahead and in quantity.
5,Simply Amazing!,"Got this printer for $199 new (plus tax). This is the only printer I have ever used that literally is plug and play. No tweaks or fiddling with settings (though the option to do that is available). Right out of the box it prints so good you'd think you were in a Kodak or Fuji lab. I've shot photos with Lumix LC5 and Lumix FZ20 and the prints are spectacular. The trickiest part was loading in the new film, after using up the sample film that came pre-loaded. It took a couple minutes to read the directions. Someone else commented about this and gave the printer a ""1"" rating. Big deal. After you install the film once, you've got the idea.I ordered supplies on Amazon.com and the per print cost goes down to $1.58 total. Ya can't do better than that at Costco or Sam's club. Think about it. An 8x10 in 90 seconds for $1.58. Best deal on the market."
2,Technically Flawed and Discusting Customer Support,"A consumer level printer only. Each page has micro-lesions running the length of the print. This appears to be caused by the feeded rolls cutting the top layer of the photo. Olympus engineers did not know of this problem till I pointed it out, and acknowledged it was a problem they could do nothing aboout. Most highly noticable when you turn your brint towards a light source at an angle. Second problem is it will not print the number of copies you ask when controlled from a pc rater than ditrect media input. Don't bother asking 'professor Otto' from their web-site as they don't reply to customer requests. They don't answer their phones either. This is an inferior product."
1,More garbage from Olympus,Avoid this printer for the following reasons.1) It's paper size doesn't fit regular frames 8x10 or 4x6.2) It takes ribbons that are sometimes difficult to load.3) Print quality is about the same as a the latest ink jets.4) Doesn't have slots for Compact Flash or Secure Digital cards only Smart Media which almost nobody still uses.5)Consumables are at least twice the cost of ink-jets.
5,Peak Learning Key for the Information Age,Ronald Gross is a master teacher who understands the fundamental value of learning. Peak Learning offers the building blocks to a lifelong learning adventure. I recommend this book for anyone looking to make order out of the chaos caused by the information overload of our times.
2,Covers the basics well but has been poorly edited.,Gross covers plenty of territoryin this primer for new students but the condescending tonegrated on my nerves. Obviously the editorof the book failed to use Gross's theoriessince the editing is not up to snuff.
1,Daily Blandness!,Here is another completely new way for those who are 'Get Fuzzy' fans to be reminded of how bad this strip is on a daily basis!
2,Smurf This,"What were they thinking when they made this. Okay okay I know it is a little kids game, but come on it was way too easy, I beat it in an hour. Although I got to say it was some what fun while it lasted and probably a game worth the used price but don't expect a lot of play time out of this one."
2,Don't get too excited,"I love the anime, so i figured I'd get the game. It started off promising. Though the graphics were weak for the DC, it had some nice strategic gameplay elements and the way some of the characters from the anime were brought into the game was quite nice (at least the two I got to). Unfortunately, it's very easy to get stuck partway through the game, and that's what happened to me. As a result I can't give this game a very good score. If more effort had been put into it it would have been great, but sadly it falls short."
3,Hmmm rare game,"This game was very boring. I mean really boring. The graphics were bad. But I heard this was a good game and rare, yes rae. The only good thing about having this game is that its one of those hard to find games that make people say ""ooooo"" because it hasnt bin seen in stores for decades (well actually years but....) The gameplay was that of diablo (ack I hate tht game) quit slow. I never cared to beat it because it just got so da#@ (Am I alound to swear in review?) boring the 1st hour, yes in the first hour. Theres nothing in this game that stood out. The characters from the series never showed up either (well as far as I got )-not very far. I didnt recognize really anything from the series. I was a joke I was expecting more. For those thinking of buying it I say trade in your dreamcast and get another, better game station! And just don't get this game its a waste of time and money."
5,A subliminal Christmas with Jessye Norman,"Jessye Norman has a powerful and beautiful voice; and When that voice is combined with traditional carols, a cathedral and a big orchestra the result is a journey throughout our childhood full of christmas trees, gifts, snow and chilly air. These both concerts are a gift to our child inside that remembers christmas as the most special time of our life. Thank you Mrs. Norman!"
5,bbc fan,Good price on Dvd had six hilarious episodes and clear picture with a great cast still no real extras bios good give me bloopers.
5,This DVD is also contained in the boxed set of AYBS,"When I purchased the boxed set of the first 5 series of ""Are You Being Served?"" Amazon.com suggested this DVD as well. It seemed only natural, since it's labeled ""Volume 6"" -- but note that this is a duplicate of the Volume 6 disc in the 7-DVD boxed set!So despite Amazon.com's suggestion, don't buy this if you're also buying the boxed set. :^>(I didn't intend to review the disc itself, only to make this information available ... but this DVD is one of the best, and it includes a somewhat rare episode that isn't often shown in on U.S. PBS stations: ""Founder's Day,"" in which the staff put on a ""This Is Your Life""-type presentation for Mr. Grace.)"
3,low - dinosaur act cd single,"if you have the vinyl version of 'things we lost in the fire', you'll already have all 3 songs. if you have the cd version of that album though, the 2 b-sides from this single were left off, so this might be worth it for you."
4,Idiomatic Tchaikovsky,"The second volume of the Tchaikovsky Cycle has the Second Symphony (""Little Russian""), in my opinion the least inspired of the early symphonies, often nervous or noisy and musically not really cohesive. The performance is certainly exciting, especially in the powerfully played finale, but I will not return to it soon. This is a matter of preference and should not deter you if you like the score. Eight excerpts from the composer's only famous opera Eugene Onegin (based on Pushkin's novel) are included. The soloists, Lydia Shernikh (soprano) and Alexander Nenadovsky (baritone), are excellent, perfectly at home in this piece, and the original Russian text does much more justice to the musical flow than the various translations. The audience responds enthusiastically."
2,Mindless Opacity,"One of Allingham's few (mercifully few) outstanding failures. The plot is a mess, with a lot of needless complications (all recounted in Allingham's obscure manner that makes Gladys Mitchell look sober and straightforward) failing to disguise the fact that there is no actual plot to speak of. The murderer is known very early on, revealed and killed some chapters before the end, which is an anti-climax rivalled only by the behaviour of Albert Campion."
2,Near the end for dreamcast,"I just bought the game and have only played it for an hour so far. What I have seen form 2k2 so far is that it has improved on the features but the graphics are inferior to last years game and most baseball games on the market right now. Maybe next time, if there is one, dreamcast can put the whole package together."
5,The Best Baseball Game Out There,"This has got to be the best baseball game on the market.The learning curve is not to steep and you will be hitting the ball with ease in no time.Base running,throwing and fielding are all excellent.I just got through playing a complete season which took about 3 months playing it pretty regulary and made it to The World Series and won....the cpu is smart and depending on what skill level you have the game set on the cpu is a tough opponent.Pitching in this game RULES!Curveballs,Sinkers,sliders,fastballs,Change-ups,forkballs and splitters.They're all here!The players are so realistic it's like you are controlling real life players.Each player has their own unique body type,batting stance and swing.Mark Mcguire looks and acts JUST like Mark Mcguire.All of the players are true to life.If you own a Dreamcast or are thinking of buying one this game is a must in your Sports Collection."
3,Some good points.,I rate the Game a 8. there are some good parts and a couple ofbad parts. The graphic's are good and the franchise mode isgreat.. The one weak part of the game is the Gameplay. thepitcher is slow to the plate. and the play in the field is weak.Batting is O.K. but I wish it took a little more skill to begood. all in all I would only by this game on sale. ...
3,so-so,"i would give it a 3. Its okay. The good things are that the graphics are good, and the stadiums look like their real countier parts. The bad things are that the anouncers always repeat the same thing over and over again and the announcer makes mistakes. If its a linedrive to center field, he will say the ball is hit a mile in the air to deep right and that kind out stuff. Another bad thing is that when the ball is hit into the crowd, it just dissapers when its own the crowd. A wacky thing is that it you are two feet away from the ball you will still catch it and you could catch the ball when you are standing backwards."
2,how would any one know?,"I don't have any clue if WSB2k2 is any good but from what I know from last years game, its a dud. No fielding? No home-run-derby? Then that's no baseball. A possitive comment: excellent graphics.david west"
1,booooooooooooooooooo,(...). Ya I admit you could finally play defense but they totally changed everything. What happened to saying how many home runs they had after they hit one? What happened to the home runs and what the hell is that new system of hitting? What are those graphics? It went from great graphics to terrible graphics.It was a big let down. (...). So i have to say BOOOOOO.
4,theres 1 problem!,"world series baseball 2k2 is a very good game...it is much better than last years game, but i think there is one problem...too many homeruns! if u get the batting curser underneath the ball just slighty, the ball leaves the yard with no problem....but besides that, i think the game is a major success!!"
3,"Good, but i think they could have made better","This game is an overall good game. But there are some bad things.1.) The outfeilders sometimes catch the ball with their backs, and it looks stupid . Also the outfeilders sometimes do a pee dance waiting for a fly ball.2.) The anouncer says stupid things sometimes. Such as ""a pop fly to the second baseman"" but it is really a grounder.But there are also some really cool things in the game.1.) Is when playing francis mode, you can bring up and send people down to the mirnor league. And the minors players are real players!!2.) In WSB 2k2 you can feild the ball, unlike 2k1 which the cpu does it for you.3.) Their is a home run derby. But whats bad about it is that home runs count as outs, and there isnt a way to turn it off.4.) They have real cool stats for the players. They have cold and hot hiting zones.I might have given this game 4 stars but i think it is more of 3 1/2 stars. So i gave it 3"
4,Played it Today,"Well, went to All-Star Fanfest today and they had about 15 WSB 2K2 stands to actually PLAY the game! I own 2K1 and I am very disappointed. 2K2 was fun to play and I am going to be preordering it very soon. They have drastically improved the gameplay and the added cool things. I was disappointed because they used a burned disk from SEGA and it was very buggy. However, they had season mode in which you have minor leagues and can call up people! VERY COOL. Home Run Derby, and online stuff. They have new players ICHIRO! and the stadiums PNC PARK. and you can play defense and commit errors. Anyhow things Im dissapointed in are the bugs but they will be gone and the fact that some of the players stances dont look like they do in 2K1. It is not as graphically inhanced as 2K1, but over all I am impressed and very very excited for the August 1 release date."
4,World Seires Baseball 2k2 (was it worth it to make it),"World Series Baseball 2k2 is a pretty good game. In some categories it's better than last years, in other's it's not. Playability wise the fielding is well designed and pitcher/batter is good. The graphics has taken a step down. Last year my family couldn't tell the difference between the game and t.v. Now you can't really tell who is who facial wise. All in all it is a little better than ps2 baseball games. If they had used this gameplay with last years graphics it would be great. If you have a dreamcast buy it."
4,World Series Baseball 2K2,I own this game for the dremcast platform and I relly love the game especially the franchise mode. The only problems being that:1.It takes 192 blocks of your VMU to save (like all other Sega Sports games for Dreamcast).2.And in multiplayer mode you can see what part of the strike zone your opponent pitchet the ball in when at bat.But all in all it is a good game
3,A point about players' names,"To correct someone's earlier review: The reason certain players' names are changed, like Benny Agbayani, for example, is because he's not a member of the Major League Baseball Players Union. It's the same case with Rick Reed and a few others (these players were replacement players during the last lock-out and therefore have not yet been accepted into the players' union). With licensed MLB products, only actual MLB union members are allowed to be depicted for licensing purposes. So what's why you never see their names in MLB-related stuff. Someone comment earlier that players like Benny were left out so that programmers could use their own names in the game, which is a TOTAL falsehood."
5,Great game,"This is one of the best baseball games I have ever played, and i've played some great ones. The curveballs actually drop insted of just curving, and it's easier to call your pitches than W.S.B.2k1. Most of the rosters are up-to-date, and it's sweet that you have the minors on franchise mode. The price is fair, and i think it's worth it. Buy this game!"
4,Okay baseball fans,"Do Not buy this game if you're looking for a 4 player baseball game.This game is only 2 player game...,no 2 people on teams vs 2 other on line,...other wise this game is good,easy to play,Graphics look good,most liky the best baseball game around."
3,Wow it could have been better,"I will get straight to the problems.First you can only create three players total.Second after a Franchise season you have to release who ever is out of a contract, you cant even attempt to resign him.So you have to try to get him back in a fantasy draft instead of being able to resign him. Now I expected a little more from the gameplay.When you hit the ball it is 90% of the time a line drive.Sometimes the screen cant even keep up with the ball.There is also only one fielding view which looks like your sittting in the bleachers.Second I love the minor leaguers option but if your not that team you cant accquire the player that you like from another.Lastley in a actual game(not a home run derby), you're not even given the distance.It's obvious the game has improvements but they took away the few things that were good in WS2K1.I will stil play it because it's the only baseball game for dreamcast."
4,Welcome Back,"Despite peaking at around the fifth series, this show still has its moments. Although it's a completely different atmosphere all round, and some of the more dark humour has been abandoned (probably due to the absence of former co-writer Rob Grant, whose novel 'Backwards' was riddled with it). Sadly, the once hilarious Kryten has become kind of annoying, and Cat has become more of a conduit of filler material since his days of great lines aboard Starbug. But bringing Chris Barrie back as Rimmer was a good move, even if he isn't as sarcastic and evil as the hologram version of the earlier series. If you like this show then I recommend the video. These first three episodes are not the best, but act as a good introduction to the series, which is definately superior to the near-dire series 7. What befuddles me is why it has been released in the US before the UK?"
1,Uh oh!,"Ooooooooh dear... To date, in my opinion, Red Dwarf has never been better than in series' 5 and 6. And here's the proof. Whereas in those earlier series, the jokes were side-splitting, well thought through and generally really funny, here we have nothing but some daft lines and silly characters. The humour is just so goofy now - just watch the ""hilarious"" meetings between Rimmer, Lister and the Captain. Just silly. Captain Hollister has also been reduced to plain daft, and Doug Naylor seems to think that having the Captain get angry and shout is hilarious. No. Kryten and Cat are also treated badly, and the whole setting of the crew in prison is just annoying (they have done what excactly? Steal some information...that's a court martial offence?!?). The special effects are quite good, but on the whole this is a dreadful reminder of how much Red Dwarf desperately needs Rob Grant to come to the rescue. Doug Naylor, either give up or get some other writers to help. You're crap."
1,Red Dwarf lost it's momentum from series 7,"It lost everything the series had built up. You have the stupid humour of Rimmer and Lister reporting to the ship's captain which gets old in the first episode. It is too bad to think such a funny series took such a dramatic plunge (head first) from where it was before. Granted expectation were high, but you can truly feel the commercialised writing and pointless humour. Where's Ace Rimmer? Well, you won't see him here, or any other interesting character that past episodes have developed. You are left with the captain that is a true bore. Series 8 did not do Red Dwarf justice!"
2,Borrow a friend's tape - it's not worth paying for,"Red Dwarf has really gone downhill in series 8. It has lost the depth that made it stand apart as a must see show in past seasons. The jokes are stupid and everyone acts even more idiotically than usual (and that's saying a lot!). There are some truly funny moments here, but they are few and far in between. I recommend drinking a few pints of your favourite lager before watching this season, maybe then it'll seem comparable to the last seven."
3,Thread breaking,"I think what you need to do to prevent your thread breaking is adjust the tension on the thread. It should be easy to do on a machine like that, I'm sure the manual can help or you can go to any local fabric store and they can help you"
3,Don't know why the thread is always broken.,"We bought this sewing machine for our coming baby. I hadn't seen any other reviews before I bought it. The reason for me to choose this machine over others is the reasonable price and the reputation of the brand. After spending one afternoon figuring how to use it, the needle suddenly broke. Fortuately, there are another two in the accessories bag. THe main thing makes me worried is that if I sew fast, the thread will be broken. I kind of feel sewing speed should not be a problem to cause the thread broken. Maybe I am not proficient in operating this machine. I hope someone will give me some advice on how to solve the problem."
5,Good Stuff,"I've been a fan of slow row for a few years now, and i'm glad that their starting to get some attention. they should have broke it big instead of Drowning Pool, but they are still rising. Every single song on here is killer. stand-out tracks like #4,#9,#6, the radio single is track 1. these guys are what real metal's about, not that linkin park garbage. the guitar work has the chunkage of Dime, the drums drive the metalbus, and if the singers not scream/growling his nuts off, he's singing, if he's not singing you might hear him through his bull-horn. these dudes put on an awsome live show. get this cd, steal it, or something."
2,The Quality isn't a good explanatory variable for the price,"Actually I do think that this book is too expensive, it is not worth to buy it. It spends five chapter (167 pages), more than 60% of the book, to teach matrix algebra, reader can easy read the detail matrix algebra review from many econometric texts such as Greene and Johnston. I don't think this part is helpful. For the last three chapters, it just discuss the material about OLS, all of these can be easy found in some introductory econometric text. I don't think it is very useful for anyone to read this book before studying other econometic text."
3,Compelling reading...,"Especially if you live in the East Tennessee area or vacation in Gatlinburg TN often. Everyone wonders about ""the mansion on the hill"" but all you hear are rumors about drug dealers, etc. This book gives you an accurate picture of the atmosphere of the area in the 1970s & 1980s, when it really paid to know the ""right"" people. Interesting & enjoyable ""true crime"" novel."
4,Great Value,"We expected this would take a couple of hours to put together. We were wrong, it took about 6 hours. Of course, we're not at all handy. After spending that much time putting it together, we were disappointed that one of the last pieces was missing. However, the manufacturer sent us a new one in a couple of days. Now that it's put together, it's been a great product. We're pleased with the quality and the ease of changing the height. We couldn't find a better quality portable 50"" backboard remotely close to this price."
4,Great Portable Hoop,My husband and I assembled this in about 3 hours. The instructions really were not that bad. I have seen much much worse. A few of the pieces are tricky to put together but it was not the fault of the instructions. We both understood what needed to be done and how it should be done. It was actually doing it that caused some frustration. I'm referencing the portion of assembly involving the aparatus used to adjust the rim up and down.The finished product is nice and works well for my purposes. The rim and backboard vibrate a little more than I would like (the reason for the 4-star rating) but I think that was the sacrifice I made for choosing the portable system over an in-ground system. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.
3,There must be better products than this...,"I read a lot of reviews on this product prior to purchasing it. Also, I am a woodworker and have assembled many tools a lot more complicated than this in less time. 1) the parts did not show up. I was missing parts from the base, rim and backboard. 2) when I called, they would not send the parts 2-day express (another week goes by...) 3) the directions were poorly done. All I can say was that I was warned by other reviews and I should have been smarter about this purchase..."
4,Same As Other 'Bliss' For A Few Less Dollars,"Amazing, This is a great singer at the top of her form. Plenty of up beat songs, but more slow songs than most other Paradis albums-all of which are very compelling. If you are a fan, this is a must have, but a casual listener might enjoy the first Live CD more. It's great that she's still putting out top quality material-year 2000 and as good as anything I've heard. In French, but English speakers won't miss a thing."
4,fantastic!,"My favorite Vanessa CD was Portrait (Variations), but this one is destined to be right up there with that disc. Varying her styles rather drastically throughout the course of the album, she shows off her (slightly!) matured vocal talents quite creatively, and quite rewardingly. If you're like me and have been dying for Vanessa to put out a new disc, your prayers have been answered! Definitely worth your money."
5,Cool and intriguing,"Vanessa really mixes up the styles on this one. There's everything from the sort of techno and electric guitar stomp of ""Commando"" to the fragile samba lounge of ""St. Germain"". Jazzy horns fill out many of the tracks while ""L'eau et le Vin"" has a middle eastern flavor. Other tracks have a folky sound. Overall, though, there is a similarity of the material that keeps the disc sounding cohesive rather than flighty.Of course, she's no diva wailer but I like that. I like the way she uses what she has. Her vocals are seductive and she makes certain her voice fits in as it leads the music and then at other times seems to hide inside it. Much more intelligent singing than alot of the shrieking that is popular nowadays.The arrangements are classy and simple. Lots of interesting instrumentation and non-standard songwriting and production make this well worth picking up."
4,Big Band With Humor and an Edge,"Rachel Z and Aziza Mustapha Zadeh are as close to ""smooth jazz"" as I can stomach, and I've never been a ""big band"" fan--more an Anthony Braxton/David S. Ware/John Zorn kind of guy. With that said, this album is sophisticated, funny and edgy. The review by ""A Music Fan"" is off the mark and kind of misses the point of the session."
2,smooth jazz. 'nuff said.,"normally i wouldn't even review a CD like this, but since someone thoughtlessly gave it to me as a gift i thought i'd share.if you like smooth jazz then it might be your cup of tea. i don't like smooth jazz. i put this CD on and... well i kind of liked the first track. but by the third track I felt like i was strolling through a department store. very bland and too smooth. no life, no edge. this is the kind of music that people so offensively play when they want to play something unoffensive.sorry - james mcbride might be talented and maybe i'd like him in a hard bop or other more vital setting. but on this cd... smooth jazz. 'nuff said. my 2 cents."
3,smaller than stated,"I love this bank, except that it is quite small (4"" cube). I am still undecided if I want to keep it or not."
5,FUnny,You've gotta see this. Robert Gant from Queer as Folk plays a 50's Dad who is a fudge packer... in a candy store.
4,Fun,This game rocks. The players are so simple looking and move smoothly. It arrived before expected and didn't work at first but I fixed it
2,Bilingual Parallel text - French and English,"I love reading bilingual or parallel French and English books. It is a pleasant way to learn French. However, the ""French Short Stories 2"" edited by Simon Lee is a collection of the most depressing and miserable short stories that I have ever read - covering such topics as suicide, battle deaths, or decayed bodies on the beach.The translations were good, I only wish the editor chose some redeeming stories."
3,did i miss the turn??,"when i first got this game I thought It was going to be like Gundam side story 0079, where your in the cockpit. i'm warning you if your looking for a good graphics high detail ms combat game, this ain't it. It has game boy graphics and little realism, plus bangai-o, the cool mobile suit(ms), is a speck on the viewscreen. but if your two years old get this and giggle. otherwise trust me."
4,Catchy as hell!,I really like this cd--the tunes have a great pop vibe and brooke's lyrics are really meaningful. This cd is worth the the 10 bucks!
3,Weak and Lacks Passion,"While T. S. Eliot may have had good intentions in arguing for a Christian society, he lacks the conviction to build a solid case. He seems overly concerned with style, which really isn't that commendable, merely academic sounding--and dated at that. His arguemnt really breaks down when in his mind he lowers Christianity to other religions.In discussing the fact that the church and the world will always be at odds, other writers make the same point, only more convincingly. Peggy Noonan comes to mind immediately. She makes the case much more passionately."
2,3 yr old not impressed,"The seller was late in shipping due to his error, The product was great as sold but my 3 yr old was not impressed with it did not really enjoy the game too adcanced for him"
2,"Too expensive, one less game than previous version","My 4 y/o loved playing his older cousins Leapster, so when I found the older unit at a great price, I got it. I knew I'd have to have the same Dora game, but could only find this L-MAX version. The problem starts with a feature of the L-MAX that only allows one of the games called ""Animal Adventure"" to be played if L-MAX is plugged into the TV. That means the older, cheaper verion of Dora offers an extra game on the handheld! I think product development really dropped the ball on this one.I returned the L-MAX version and found the cheaper plain Leapster version instead. I'm still offended that Leapfrog would charge more for this version and offer less.If your kid doesn't need to plug into the tv, pass this one up and shop for the non-L-MAX version of Dora's Wildlife Adventure."
4,Nice Fit,The product has a nice snug fit that will protect my lantern for some time. As they say it Fits better then OJ's glove.
3,"Great cocoon, needs a zipper","The neoprene used is much thicker than I expected, which was a welcome surprise. However, even though I ordered this knowing that there was no zipper, I expected the cocoon to close more snugly. However, when you close it up, the neoprene does creep up a bit, exposing the lantern to danger. A zipper, or some way to keep the cocoon closed would make this a 5 star item for sure."
3,wrong color,"This item is quite expensive for what it is. I got it because it fits and protects my red candle lanterns. However, I ordered two of these in black but one arrived in blue. Agrhh, this blue does not go well with my red lantern! Since I will use it this weekend I will not go through the hassle of returning it. Buyers beware, you don't know what color you will get!"
4,Excellent way to pack away safely,"This is an excellent way to pack your lantern away safety and protect it from accidental breaking. I travel by motorcycle and many times I've lost my lantern in my tail bag only to later find I've loaded heavy stuff on top of it. Half a dozen glass globes later, I discovered this cocoon that protects the glass."
5,Great DVD!,"Very funny show. Any fan of Are You Being Served will love it. Funny, funny, funny! A must have DVD."
1,Use REA's CLEP Human Growth and Development instead,"I used the Educational Psychology test prep guide to study for the Ed. Psych CLEP exam. This book was so out of date that it included references to imbeciles, cretins and morons when talking about people with developmental disabilities. There is no study guide included in this book. It is simply a series of tests with answer keys, but there is no explanation of the answers.I also recently took the Human Growth and Development CLEP and found that the study guide put out by REA for that exam was invaluable in studying for the Educational Psychology exam."
2,Lullaby...,"I did not like this book at all. I had to read it for my summer assignment for Government AP. It was extremely boring, however, not very complicated to read. If you have trouble falling asleep at night then purchase this book immediately."
1,Not good at all....,When I first ordered this book I thought I would receive a NEW BOOK since thats what I was paying for... I chose the standard shipping...The book WAS NOT NEW and the shipping took WAY TOO LONG...
1,"Liberal, Liberal, Liberal","My God! This book could have been written by the ACLU itself. At every possible chance, Irons discards objectivity in exchange for a liberal slant. Don't read this one unless you have to!"
5,The Courage of Their Convictions: Sixteen Americans,"This was a fantastic book! People may know about some Supreme Court decisions and its impact but I do not think people understand why such important cases were brought before the Supreme Court. We never learn in school who these people were, (they are everyday people) and exactly how much courage and determination it takes to fight your case to the Supreme Court (after all I think S.C hears about 1% of all cases filed to the Court). Irons is an academic but boy you can read this in a day-this is not a dreaded book you are assigned to read for school."
4,A Summer Reading Assignment That is in Fact Interesting,"I was instructed to read The Courage of Their Convictions as a summer reading assignment for AP US Government. Usually, I dread reading summer assignments, but this book was written in a way that made the cases relatable and interesting. I appreciated the fact that it had first hand accounts of the major player in each of the suits, the person who was defending their freedoms as an American. It wasn't written in a complex way, the text had a good flow to it. I felt like I was getting a proper idea of how the Supreme Court actually runs, and overall it was a worthwhile read."
4,Just From Observing My Daughter....,"She seems to absolutely love this cartridge. She received for her birthday on 10/21, and has not used any other cartridge since! we have to kick her out of the bathroom because she brings it in there with her also!!!! As for the educational value I couldn't answer, but it has held her attention."
1,Two D660's later and still no good.,"Don't buy a D660u. A week ago I bought (from Amazon) a new Canon D660u. After I hooked it up I noticed that the underside of the glass had grime on it and needed to be cleaned. An email from Canon in response to my question asking how to clean the underside of the glass, I was told that it is not consumer serviceable and needs to be forwarded to a warranty station. An email to Amazon brought a VERY prompt reply and an offer to Air Express a replacement unit or issue a refund. The second one arrived in two days and is just as contaminated. Looks like a grimey gray wavey film on the bottom of the glass that simply needs a two second cleaning. What a shame that this simple that task is not something Canon thinks ever needs to be done. I'll be returning this one too (at Amazon's expense). I sure like dealing with Amazon, though. They're number one in my book. Canon on the other hand, sucks."
2,Upgraders be warned!!,"This scanner has everything you could want: good quality, good usability, good speed. However, tech support is lacking. The packaging states (in small type) that this model does not support the use of a USB to PCI add-on card. My parents purchased this system because it was recommended to them, but they did not understand the difference between an add-on card and 'native' USB support. And the documentation does little to clarify this restriction for inexperienced users. For that matter, their technical support website and phone support did not address this issue either. If you had to purchase an upgrade card to enable your system to communicate with USB devices, then this system is NOT for you!!"
3,CANOSCAN SCANNER,"I really can't say too much about the scanner. Although the scanner worked, I never got the software to work on my computer's system. But I can tell you that the seller was very nice and patient w/me trying to get the software to work. The delivery was good and the communication with the seller was great."
3,"Poor photo quality scans, not worth it for the money","Bought this scanner because it was supposed to be a good photo scanner, but when i got it and set it up the quality was worse then the scanner i had gotten for about 60 bucks a year or two earlier. For just everyday scan use and not for nice photo quality scans it worked ok. Was very fast, just don't reccommend if you are looking for a high qualtiy scan. Returned and it took forever to get my money back."
3,Meet Wally West!!,"This collection looking into the early days of Wally West as both Kid Flash and then just Flash is a fun read. The art, except for Humberto Ramos, really holds up over time and the story is decent but hokey. The overall collection is a little weak but it is what it is, an introduction to a great character."
3,Decent History Review,"If, like me, you're a newcomer to the Flash fandom, this book is a good review of how Wally got his powers, and what forces helped shape him into the person he became. However, the stories really don't go too deep into young Wally's psyche, and alot of questions are left unanswered. The art is so-so. Most of it is very traditional comic book art, which isn't my cup of tea. I prefer more contemperorary art and manga-style art. But that's just my personal taste."
3,The Slowest Read for the Fastest Man,"Haven't we been here before? If you're not up on who the Flash is (Wally West's Flash) then it might be worth your time to pick this up. There's just no new ground covered here. It's a decent introduction to Wally, but nothing terribly interesting or groundbreaking."
1,Kindle preview shows nothing,"The kindle preview of this book shows us: nothing.Not a single pattern is contained, so I am left with the feeling that the author/publisher is ashamed to show the content? Afraid to ... what, publish a secret?Many kindle books are hardly usable for their bad grafics. How am I to decide about this?I won't buy the book under this circumstances. Period."
3,Frustrating,"The content of this book is good. My criticism is that the layout is badly planned. You have to refer to charts on different pages, then look at the questions on another different page, then refer to the answers on another different page etc. Lots of flipping pages back and forth, kind of ruined it for me."
3,Candlestick course,This book will improve your candlestick skills and help improve your trading success if combined with other indicators. The book is really like a textbook with questions and tests after each chapter so if you are expecting a spoonfeeding course then you might be disappointed because you have to do some homework and really practice with this book.
1,Based on what?,"Reconstructing the Subject: Modernist Painting in Western Germany, 1945-1950 lacks historic fact and accuracy. Heibel jumps from speculation to speculation without ever using a single secondary souce."
3,low end build,"Shipping container looked in good condition upon arrival, but 3 drawers had their sliders bent out of their mounts, probably by heavy dropping.I repaired the mount for the sliders as best as I could, but the sliders bind a bit and the drawers don't line up squarely. Shipping was free and it shipped in only about 2 days after the order. Side hanger hooks are a joke as they hang loosely and flop around."
4,Firetruck lamp,"Cute little lamp - looks great in my son's new transportation themed room. The colors are not quite as bright in person - more of a burgandy-red and the ladders and top part are a kind of khaki-olive green color. At first I was disappointed by the colors, but upon putting it in his room, it actually ended up looking really nice with the colors already in there (but for someone looking for bright red and white, this might not work). My only other complaint would be the order of the lights...on the first click you get the night light, on the second the regular lamp, and on the third both - It would make more sense for the nightlight-only to be the last click so that if you wanted to turn the nightlight off after your child's asleep, you could do so with one click (vs. having to turn the whole lamp on and possibly waking them). Other than that, great little lamp."
4,"Cute- Doesn't function perfectly, though","This is a cute lamp with good paint quality and quick shipping. Our problem: the switch isn't quite right. It needs to be in-between ""clicks"" in order to have the lamp on. Makes me a little nervous as I've always been a little afraid of electrical fires, etc. We use it, though, and the night light in the cab is great. I should mention that we did not contact the seller about the switch issue. My husband says it's not a safety issue & we could always install a new one, so it didn't seem worth the effort to send back. I would recommend."
1,unworkable product,These masks only work if you use one or both hands to secure them to your face. You wind up breathing more room air than oxygen because of their poor design. The bag is too small & when you exhale it blows right up into your eyes.
2,Not that funny.,"Ever since spongebobs creator, Stephan Hillenburg retired from the cartoon, the new episodes of spongebob seem less funny than the classics...and if you look carefully, you will notice that the characters look diffrent. The last thing Stephan worked on was the spongebob movie. Now, he left the show to his producer.When I watch the NEW spongebob, I am saying to myself, ""the classic spongebob beats the NEW spongebob. The NEW CREATOR is trying to make us laugh like we did before Hillenburg retired, but right now, they are making the show look bad."
2,Don't be fooled,"Green Rogue is marketed as a follow up to Sarge's Here's 2...Well, don't be fooled. The graphics are a joke and it is a typical 'quick to market' answer to a succesful predesessor. Do yourself a favor and buy another game."
2,Is This An Army Men Game?,"I always liked Army Men games since I bought Sarge's Heroes 2 for N64, but this is an exeption. The grapics are the worst I have seen for PlayStaion ever. It is very hard to move around the person your controlling and the idea of having no auto aim is pretty bad because it is impossible to hit a tan. I gave it 2 stars because of the choices of weapons but that is it. This game looks like it was published in 1994. It was so bad I got rid of it the day I bought it. My advice is simple JUST DON'T BUY IT!"
1,How Army Men Green Rogue Stinks,"I have Army Men Green Rogue for PS2.My cousin who is the best at viedo games can only get to the 2nd level.But I know a code[cheat]for it.In the game press start and press R1, R2, square, triangle and L1.That makes you invisible."
2,A little light on this yoga strap,I was used to the heavier gauge strap that I use at the studio where I practice. This one tends to bind and cut in a bit and is more difficult to undo.
4,Does its job,"Nice yoga strap. I have really short arms so a yoga strap is very useful for me. Now that I have used both, I think I prefer the D ring metal latch, but this one works well too. Just alittle easier to hook and stay hooked with the metal D rings."
4,yoga strap,"I had to buy this strap, to match the brand and the color of the yoga mat I bought. It works like other straps, but its also nice to have it in the same color as the mat."
3,Too Long,This is a decent quality strap but I do not like the metal tip on the strap as it is noisy in a yoga class as it strikes the ground. I should have bought a 6 ft strap the 8 ft is too long.
5,A Wonder Book,"Stephen Bann's book is a true joy and a work of art. Paul Delaroche was one of the great artists of the 19th century, but has never obtained the position in modern day, art history books he so rightly deserves. Bann analyzes works such as ""The Execution of Lady Jane Grey"" and ""The Young Christiam Martyr."" Bann's examination is thorough and fair. So little is written on Delaroche, that it is a joy to find such a complete study. The color plates are stunning. A very well written book."
3,A must have,"This DVD is a must have. The quality of the video is very poor, the soundtrack is acceptable. The music selection is excellent.Los enenitos verdes is a great band. I did not know most of their songs and thanks to this DVD I was able to appreciate what wonderful Spanish rock musicians they are.I definitely recommend this DVD."
3,Decent but wrong length,"Bird does a decent job summarizing this kitschy topic in a succinct manner. In a sense though the length of this book is its worst enemy. He could have either been even more brief and cut about 50% of it to focus on the main issues rather than repeating himself. Alternatively, he could have truly explored the characterization of the individuals behind the craze as well as probed the American psyche and increased the length by 50%. Straddling the middle, Paint By Numbers ends up being pleasant but vaguely dissatisfying."
1,ThIs Is Worst Music Documentary EVER,"DON'T EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS TRAVESTY. I collect music documentaries extensively and I have seen both great and terrible videos. This is in a class by itself. Yes, all the songs are there -- in audio. The video NEVER matches the audio and there is no live footage where the video matches the audio. The inane commentary might be interesting but the only person who never sings audibly on camera is LEON RUSSELL. It is as if they bought the video rights without audio and audio rights without matching video. You would be better listening to the music and ignoring the video. At least then the commentary would not have to be put up with. This is a [copy] of an artist who deserves better.William E. Donoghue AKA 'fessor Mojo"
1,worthless at any price,"I can only hope the ""authors"" did not take more than 30 minutes to put this awful little book together. It is of no use for anyone remotely involved or planning to be involved in pediatric echocardiography. The images would be horrible if it were 10 years ago. I purchased it to give to one of the newer techs in my lab but will toss it in the trash instead since it would be insulting to give it to anyone. 1 star only because that is the lowest Amazon.com allows.Michele P. Monaco, M.D."
1,Not worth the money,"Poorly written, typos abound. Not well organized or comprehensive. Poor quality Echo images. Overall not a useful book at all."
1,Worthless book. DO NOT BUY- DO NOT ACCEPT AS GIFT,Step by Step Pediatric EchocardiographyNot worht 5 bucks. Worthless book. I am a registered diagnostic cardiographic sonographer. I bought this book to gain some insight into performing pediatric echos. I learned nothing by reading it. Many errors within.
1,worthless,"worthless book, total waste of moneyavailable in India for about 30 rupees, i.e. less than one dollar, surprised that it is priced so high here"
1,Mislabeled anatomy,I bought this book and quickly noticed mislabeled anatomy. Didn't want to trust reading it more. I quickly returned it.
1,Step by Step Pediatric Echocardiography,"Don't waste your money. This book is worthless!! Poor information, This is not at the at the expected skill set of pediactic sonographers. Very elementry."
2,Limited Faux Painting Techniques,"I guess I should have paid closer attention to the cover of the DVD on the web page as I didn't realize that the DVD just covered Venetian Plaster, Woodgrain Finishes and Marble Finishes. I was expecting all of the Faux Finishes to be included such as leather, sand grain, crackle, etc. For the price of $29.95 I don't feel that this DVD really gives value for money. The ad for the DVD should highlight better the three areas of Faux Painting featured on it. I was very disappointed."
3,Mueller's not-so-good is still pretty good!!,"As always, the environmental plot is of immediate concern and well researched - the technical points of the actual narrative get a bit tiresome though, with the abrupt, shifting points of view making it difficult to feel very sympathetic about the many characters we're introduced to. Not one of Ms. Mueller's best by any means, but a quick, enjoyable read and still better than your average off-the-rack fiction - the ending is a neat twist that makes the book satisfying."
3,Eco murders,"Jessie Domingo is an ecologist who has been flown in from New York to a small town on the northern California coast, to help locals in their fight against a huge corporation who has claimed the right, under Californian law, to collect the town's water in massive rubber bags, which would be towed to more arid areas, for a huge profit. Old crimes, old vows of vengeance for real or imagined grievances, all come to the fore as greed battles with common sense. Old alliances break and old enemies join forces in this story of murder in a small community. Unfortunately, it just hasn't got the magic ""it"" factor which makes a book sing for me."
4,Solid Mystery From Muller,"I've been reading Muller's Sharon McCone stories for years. They aren't, in my estimation, on a par with Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple, but I always find them fun to read. Cape Perdido is not, however, a McCone mystery and I wasn't sure whether I would like it as much. Happily, I found it thoroughly enjoyable. The characters were good and the story held my interest right to the end. It was perhaps not quite as dramatic as it wanted to be -- not what I'd call spellbinding -- but enough to keep me involved. A nice standalone and another solid effort from Ms. Muller."
2,Maybe Somebody Will Like This....,This book just didn't get started for me. I'm still trying to get interested in it...and for me not to be able to keep a Marcia Muller book in my hands until I'm done is unthinkable.
1,In very bad taste,"At our own risk, if you want to watch a really dumb/stupid movie and/or waste your time (and money). Be warned!"
4,Diorama kit,"I am an avid plastic modeler builder and occasionally make a diorama, which is the reason I purchased this product. Be warned this is not for small children there are numerous small parts for children to choke on! The detailing is excellent and will enhance a Desert Storm diorama, I am in the process of building."
5,WinBack: Best Game Ever!!,"This game is great. You get to do all the stuff just like the James Bond movies. The single player is a ok mode of play where you and a team of SpecOps guys try to take back(or Win Back) a base over run by terrorists. The multiplayer is probably the best mode of play. You can choose to play by yourself or with a friend. Also, there are plenty of characters to unlock in multiplayer which keeps you playing. Also, there are seven modes of play and three of those modes you need to unlock. The first is the story mode which is the main mode, then there is the bot mode(multiplayer and single player instant action). another mode is verses which is multiplayer. Then there is tutorial which is self-explanitory and there are the three modes you need to unlock but I will not spoil them for you. Overall I think it is a great game and was well worth my money."
4,Gift,My Fiance loves the game and has finally beat it. It was a great gift for him since he remembers it from childhood. Thank you.
3,A Good Game,This is a good game with excelent graphics. I think that the environments could be touched up the slightes bit though. I am disgusted at the people that think that winback is making metal gear solid quiver in its rubber soled boots. Ithink that Solid Snake makes Jean-Luc look like a boy scout. I also think that Jean-Luc is a fairy princess. Even thoght I would never be in his position Snake is a better overall charachter. Eny one who is praising Winbak should take a peek at the Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty demo included in Zone of the Enders. I think that some of the more realistic elements make for bad game play like the ablity to hlod only a few clips at a time. Even tough my reveiw is negative twords this game try it any ways.
1,If you like 1st person shooter games you will hate this game,"This is the worst shooter game I have ever played. Weapons are pathetic, movement is akward, and aiming is purely painful. When I see the name KOIE on any other game I will certainly know not to by it. Seeing the 4 star average rating on this site makes me think that most of these reviews are bogus.( Has anyone ever seen a game with a poor rating on this site? I have not. This game diffenitly deserves a zero.) It disgusts me that there are games of this crappy nature allowed on the market. Give me a break."
1,Winback Review,Winback For The PS2 is a Sad Excuss for a game i liked it better when it was called Metal Gear Solid This game Tries so hard to be Metal Gear it is sad..The graphics are PS1 Quailty and the game play is Horrible you can barely move there is no side straf and it takes 3 gun shoots to kill anyone thats if you player does not auto aim straight at a wall in many cases He does...This game Get's a big controller Down... Dont rent dont buy DONT PLAY! -{_{V}_}aDness
3,Not as good as a previous Noni product,"True Noni is tastes like crap. This tastes like cherry flavor. Yuk. I would prefer the true flavor SOMEWHERE in the taste. There is no way to verify if this is even Noni. Cheers,"
5,Fast-Paced Thriller!,"I enjoyed this story and really got into the characters. Audrey Wilson, a financial planner has a client, janitor Ed Dixon who is accused of killing a beautiful young teacher at the school where he works. He begs Audrey to help him find a lawyer. She meets this guy in her building who is an attorney and there is an immediate attraction between them. A good part of the story deals with Audrey running from her feelings for this man because he is white and she has issues with inter-racial relationships. Audrey's sister Renita is a singer at a jazz club. She's a riot! I liked her and wish she had a bigger part in the book. Since this is a series I look forward to seeing more of this character in the future. I've read an excerpt of book #2 A Cruel Way To Die and I'm salivating for the next installment and can't wait to see what happens to Audrey next."
3,Taxes Death & Trouble,"This is a page turner! I loved the setting (affluent African American town) and the characters were well developed and likeable. I also liked the interaction between the two sisters, Audrey and Renita. I can't wait to read the next installment and hope that Audrey Wlson will be around for a long time."
4,"Taxes, Death, & Trouble",I felt a kinship with the characters in this book! Audrey and Renita's relationship reminds me of mine with my sisters. Renita is a trip! The story is fast paced and keeps you guessing until the end. The villians are as delicious as the romance between Audrey And Jules. I was thrilled with the way things ended for Ed Dixon. I look forward to seeing what happens to them in the future. Bravo Ms. Miller! Can't wait for the next installment.
4,Taxes death and trouble,"I loved this book! It's part love story, part mystery, and total enjoyment. Audrey is a likeable, classy, home-girl that's trying to make a go of a financial services business after the end of dull marriage to a stuck-up husband, Emory Kimborough. Just as things start to pick up a bit with her business, her main client Ed Dixon is accused of killing a teacher at the snooty school where he works as a janitor. He asks Audrey to find him a lawyer. She does in Jules Dreyfus who just moved into the office building where she's struggling to pay rent. While they try to get Ed freed and find the real killer, Audrey and Jules begin to fall in love. The love scenes are sizzling and the interrelationships ring true. Can't wait to see where the story goes in the next book."
4,Zone Pefect Choc Vanilla Creme,"These bars are pretty good, not as good as the chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch, but they will fill an empty spot."
5,miss the point?,"as most of my fellow reviewers have missed the point let me correct some misunderstandings. David Tibet(current 93) recorded this music to be read with the short story by Eric Stenbock,which is included. did you not read the story? heres a clue. that's what the liner notes are. this is the 2nd such work David Tibet has done and he does a good job creating an atmosphere for reading this wonderful story. If you are looking for wierd for wierds sake, PLEASE go elsewhere. The story is a retelling of Faust. Stenbock is able to add some nice twists and turns to an old tale. He paints Satan as someone to almost be pitied, but despite this pity the ""protaganist"" ultimately devotes his live to christ. To say it is good music or bad music is missing the point. It sets up a wonderful story wonderfully. If you enjoy this look for the rerelease of thomas ligotti's ""In a Foreign Town, in a Foreign Land"" 4 storys of the borderland between dream and reality set to a score by David Tibet and friends."
2,Worth the price????,"It's true that the whole package idea with the story and the creepy ambient stuff with the whispers is compelling enough to make you want to buy this disc. Unfortunately, it's not worth the money. Yes, it is a well done thirty-two minutes of halloween noise. Current 93 has done some amazing work, but this is just a fun muscle-flex. Better to go with ""Emblems"" as a starting point, or maybe ""Thunder Perfect Mind"" or ""Goddy"" for more classic C93. Spend wisely."
3,Cross Necklace Review,"The picture is very deceiving! It showed a lot of detail and it looked much bigger. We were a little disappointed, but needed this gift for a birthday the day it arrived."
5,Great Book About A Great Man,Everyone should read this book. It's interesting to see that Yeager's starts are similar to those of Larry Bird. (see Bird's autobiography Drive)
5,The best book I have ever read. Needs to be a movie.,"This book just keeps you reading and reading. I absolutly loved this book. The different ""voices"" of General Yeagers peers and friends is awesome. I especially like how it is told. Chuck is an awesome American and I would love to meet him someday."
4,The barrier is broken,"Chuck Yeager's biography is also a surrogate USAF history. From the well timed ""Sound Barrier"" attempts, to his off-duty exploits, this true American hero accurately describes the hazardous nature of military aviation, and the talented, ornery characters imbued with the ""Right Stuff"" to develop the military's cutting-edge fighters. General Yeager holds no punches in his recollections of mistreatment by the envious, unctuous newcomers bent on having his career derailed, due to his lack of educational credentials. America would do well to remember the many sterling accomplishments of General Yeager, and that someone with the physical acumen, coordination, superb vision, and a general ""can-do"" attitude does not need a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering to fly well."
5,A straight shooting biography of several amazing lives.,"Yeager personafied the WWII generation, the finest ever produced by America. His humble description of his amazing life is inspiring to all and incredible to those with a love of aviation. Besides his own history, he chronicles the life of several other people, such as lady pilots Pancho Barnes and Jackie Cochran, who also lived lives that read like movie scripts. A book that has to be read several times to be fully appreciated. Also check out ""The First and the Last"", by Adolf Galland, for an equally unusual true account by a great aviator and leader. Farron Dacus, Irving, Texas."
5,Katie H.,"My 12 year old son read this book in 4-5 days, he couldn't put it down. Obviously agreat book for all ages."
4,Hello evolution..,Lots of evolution (at least in the beginning) but great footage!! Amazing how close the guy got to the birds...
3,The Life of Birds,We thought the content was beautiful but did not appreciate the cartoon preambles.
1,Frustration,"How do you expect anyone to buy a product without size, dimensions, material, installation, etc. noted somewhere. The absence of this information makes it so frustrating in making a decision & then hope for the best."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,"I'm so happy that I finally found this movie on DVD and at such a great price. The first movie has been a favorite of mine and have watched it several times, and when I seen that I could get the second one in the same DVD, I just had to have it."
4,"Great Performances, Limited Dynamics of Period Recording","Rachmaninoff playing his four piano concertos with the great Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy and his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini are the best a lover of this great composer and master pianist could wish. However, it is a tragedy to posterity that the high quality tape recording available from the 1960's and 1970's was not yet developed to preserve these performances, because they suffer from the compressed dynamic range of the recordings of an earlier period. Otherwise, this CD would have received a 5-star rating."
4,A new rachmaninoff Preludes,"The Preludes of Rachmaninoff have been well represented in recorded form. In the days of LP, the complete set by Moura Lympany was a classic; interesting older ecordings included individual pieces by Victor Schioler and Oscar Levant.This new set by Alexander Budyonny, a name previously unknown to me, holds it own very well, if not exactly effacing the memory of individual Preludes recorded by Rachmaninoff himself. The recorded sound is excellent."
4,Great Recording,"This is a very worthwhile recording. It contains the preludes from all three opuses. The interpretations are very good but it is the sound quality that is the best thing about this recording. The sound is rich and the clear, and never harsh. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes these preludes."
1,Rather Die than Play,"High Heat Baseball is a very disappointing game. The graphics are horrible. I was playing Sega Dreamcast World Series 2K1 and when I switched to this I thought there would be better graphics. Instead I got players like Brady Anderson that don't have beards in real life but in the game they do. When pitching, you can't control where the ball is going, you can only control if it is a ball or a strike.For instance you can tell it to throw a fast ball for a strike, and it will throw it right down the middle for an easy home run. You can catch a ball that is 6 feet away and when a player throws it goes off way to the side of you and you still catch it. But fielding and base running is very fun in this game."
2,Bad graphics and a lack of realism ruin this game.,"To begin, let me just say that I don't understand why people think that this game is so good. Firstly, the graphics are extremely poor when you consider the power of the PS2. Even given the most advanced graphics engine on the planet, 3DO still managed to make this game's graphics look like an old 16-bit cartrige. In addition, this game lacks realism. The fielders take forever to reach the ball, even when it is just grounded to the shortstop. Also, it is impossible to warm up pitchers or locate any pitches with any accuracy at all. Overall, if you are looking for a great baseball game for the PS2, go with Triple Play Baseball. It has better graphics, a better pitching engine, and the fielders stay awake. This game was a huge disappointment."
3,Not so great,"I had high expectatipns for this game but am a little let down.First, the graphics are awful for a PS2 game, But since this is a baseball game graphics aren't everything. Where this game falls short is in the pitcher- batter interface where you sometimes have no control over where you pitch the ball and where some pitches(curveballs) start about 3 feet over your head. The camera options are ok pretty standard but there are no gameplay options excepy season,exhibition, and all star. No create-a-player or team or franchise mode. Best thing about the game is a 9 inning game can be played in less than 20 minutes and this is not a homerfest."
1,You've gotta be kidding!,"This is one of the absolute worst PS2 games I have ever seen. At best HH baseball looks like an average PS1 game! I have now played all 3 PS2 baseball titles and with out a doubt HH is no where near the quality of TP or ASB, and that's not saying much since I wasn't all that thrilled these 2 either. The other reviews talk about realistic game play, the fact of the matter is the graphics and player animations are so bad, that any realism is lost because of this! My final ratings as follows: 1.) Triple Play: Great graphics, gameplay ok once you get used to it. 2.) All Star Baseball: OK graphics, horrible AI, has bugs. 3.) HH Baseball: Horrible graphics, gameplay ruined by graphical glitches."
2,Could have been a LOT better!!,"I don't have much to say about this game other than it has the worst possible graphics of all baseball games I've ever played. The gameplay is good, but the graphics is very poor. When I pitch, I like to have a pithcer's camera on, and when you take a look at the catcher, it's pityful. All the time he is half-standing and half-sitting. This is bull. I only give this game 2 stars for gameplay.If graphics is impportant for you, buy an All-Stat baseball. Game.I hope that High Heat 2003 is going to be better."
2,Not as good as Triple Play,If you want a good baseball game by Triple play. EA has killer graphics and better game play.
3,Could be better. Weak graphics and no joystick control......,"Alot of gamers have praised this baseball simulation for it's gameplay alone. I think the gameplay is well done also, but the graphics looked absolutely horrible....and very choppy animation to go with it! The players' faces looked like they had gone 30 rounds in the ring, straight, with Lennox Lewis! The players run the bases and field like little Jawas. You control the players movements, pitches and swings by the analog pad instead of the important joystick....that was a really lame idea from 3D0! That is what turned me away from really appreciating this game....incredible graphics, control and gameplay is essential to have for a Playstation 2 baseball game, and this did not have all of those! Hopefully next year, they'll be better in putting out a much praised game that we all can agree with!"
3,Musky Mastery: The Techniques of The Top Guides,Good quick overall review of various types of musky fishing. A good starting point for the novice and part time musky fisherman. I enjoyed its layed back style but still packed full of useful information.
1,Arrived in appalling condition,"I ordered three of these from Hirt's through Amazon and regret that I had not checked reviews for Hirt's Nursery prior to placing an order. The plants arrived today in deplorable condition: dried out, yellowed leaves, spindly growth, and roots growing out from the bottom of the containers. Potentilla is such a lovely plant, but having ordered these from Hirt's was a huge mistake."
4,It's a Hit,"I bought my daughter the first season since she loves Scooby Doo so much, so I figured I'd get her the second season as well. Though I'm not the biggest fan of What's New Scooby Doo, she is, and she loves it. That's all that matters. She watches them all the time. (When she's not hooked on The Backyardigans, that is...)"
5,My Grandchildren loved it,Perfect gift for a 5 and 7 year old. Season Two continues the same entertainment that children seem to love and mine were no exception.
5,Second season,"What can you say about Scooby! my kids favorite show, they love this DVD set. Recomended"
4,My Kids Liked It,I won't go into the intricacies of who narrates and whether this is the 'new' or the 'old' Scooby Doo. I will just say that my 4yo likes Scooby Doo and this DVD made her very happy. That's reason enough to pick it up in my opinion! I'd buy it again. Good purchase.
2,A Poor Examination,"I have enjoyed the film ""2001"" countless times, and decided to buy this book; what a waste of time. This book offers little other than very basic scene analyisis, and some general (and fairly weak) speculations about the film. I was also supprised that the author was mistaken about which characters were in what scenes, and seemed to think that both Frank and Dave are interchangble. A large portion of the book doesn't even pertain to 2001, and mostly served as an excuse for the author to promote his other books, which he shamlessly suggests you buy. Well I'm sorry I got this book and certainly won't be purchasing any of his other books. If you want a book about 2001, I suggest looking elsewhere; as I will be!"
4,flawed but worthwhile,"This analysis of 2001 is one of the most unique and enlightening I've read to date. It finally acknowledges Kubrick's brilliant use of sound and music which few other directors besides Godard and Scorsese have ever rivaled. It's utterly perplexing, however, that for all of Chion's insights he fails to even acknowledge Kubrick's manipulation of Ligeti's ""Adventures"" for the alien sounds in the 18th Century bedroom sequence (and the composer's successful legal action for this alteration.) His interpretation of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is simply bizarre and neglects to regard the return of Ligeti's music and its insistent and concise use in the film. Regardless, Chion's book certainly expands on the formal understanding of what still remains the greatest film ever made."
5,Quiet Achiever,A great insight into the music of this quiet achiever. Having a morbid fear of flying I would never have been able to enjoy seeing this artist engrossed in his work as I live 'down under'.
4,JJ Cale in Session with Leon Russell,"A must for any fan of JJ Cale. Although this session is almost 30 years old, there is no mistaking the laid back style of the man. It is not hard to see where other talented guitarists such as Clapton and Mark Knopfler drew their inspiration from.The sound may not be as good as some of today's DTS tracks, but the session itself is as cool as it gets.Well worth the money."
3,late night with J.J.,"J.J. Cale in a studio setting playing live. Whether it be known album cuts or just one chord jams JJ plays and sings with his usual low key style, all of which is what made him a legend. My only fault,is the mix, jj's vocals are soft enough as it is but on many songs his vocals are mixed clearly to low to give the songs the effect needed. That said ,its a upclose look at a reluctant star who we all want to know just a little bit better."
