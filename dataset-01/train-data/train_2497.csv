2,Not very useful,"Almost all of the material in this book is a slightly more verbose explanation of what can be found in the docs. If used as a reference this is fine, but for someone who is trying to learn Java 3D it would probably be more useful to get a book that goes through examples and explains more clearly from the ground up. While it was not written badly, this book does not explain the concepts as clearly as they could have been. All of the examples I looked at come with the Java 3D distribution. Personally I would just download all the documentation and the Java 3D tutorial and not spend the $50."
5,... and a fine moonlight battle,"When I was a child the same things appealed to me as to other children. I had many of the same interests and beliefs--I followed as much as led. It was with this special book that I began to seperate my own child into the adult that would someday be. This book doesn't have fancily colored illustrations or a flashy narrative style that depends on shock or novelty. This book is a quietly absorbing tale that kept this child reading it over and over. It lets the reader bring his/her imagination to the story--then the story sets it on fire. Bravo, Ms. Calhoun."
4,The politics behind Masterpeice Theater,"""A fascinating narrative and analysis of Masterpiece Theatre's birth. Jarvik's book exposes the commercial and political motives of all the interested players and makes it no longer possible to think of the series only as a pleasant weekly visit to Edwardian England.""--George Griffith, Chadron State College"
5,LOVE This Mic!!!,"I love this mic and I am so glad to have it in my sound kit. I have never had a problem with it and I have been using it for almost a year now. The audio sounds great, the price is great, everything is wonderful. It's so versatile and you get two mics for one price!!!"
4,~ Not for Panasonic AG-HMC40 with XLR Adapter,"I ordered this Mic due to the mostly good reviews. I also bought the Panasonic XLR adapter which provides an offset mount for the shotgun mic, freeing up the camera's mount for the LED light.Well...first off, the Mic's barrel is much smaller than the diameter of the XLR adapter's mount. So, about 1/3 a roll of electrical tape later, wound around the barrel of the Mic; the Mic is secure in the mount.But, and a big but... this Mic is so long, that it droops down towards the front, and even with the mic mounted as far back as possible. This mic is just waaaay too long for a compact pro camera! I'll post a pic soon, just to show you."
3,Awesome water effects but....,"The water effects in this game really and truely are awesome. No game has ever matched the detail that water is treated with in this game. Having said that, all you do is drive a boat. Sometimes the boats get faster, sometimes better armed, but it's still just a boat.Now, the game is an interesting concept and it is fun to play, but the replay value on it does wear thin. Additionally, the multi-player is tough to play because unless all 4 of the players are experienced it becomes a bloodbath for the one who knows how to play. Which granted can be fun.Bottom line is this. If you can get this game for a good price then by all means get it. It is worth about... and will provide more then enough replay value. But as with many games, once you stop playing it for a while, it is not one that you will long to go back to.Good Gaming!"
2,This game blows,"Although the developers of this game were able to come up with awesome water physics and great boats, they seem to have forgotten a key component to this game: good gameplay. This game had soooo much potential, but the gameplay [is] soooo bad that I never got past the 9th mission before I gave up entirely. Basically, you get eaten up alive in this game, and when there are 20 boats coming after you, you just get slaughtered. And after the 30th time on the same mission (read: slaughter #30), I said screw it, and then I ""fuggotaboutit""... Save your money adn buy a game that won't have you throwing your controller across the room."
2,BLOOD WAKE WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP,"I was excited about this game before it came out and was anticipating its release. However, for those of you like me, let me break it to you gently. This is definitely a rental game and no more. The storyline is weak, the missions do not draw on the storyline, and the graphics are not that good when compared to other xbox games such as Halo. In my opinion, Blood Wake does not come close to using the tools that the xbox has to offer. A disappointment, but you should rent it anyway to form your own opinion. If you buy it on a whim, just remember that I told you so."
1,really ...,i'm telling all ya'll do not want to get this if i could iwould give it 0 stars but if you'd want to waste money rent it from blokbuster.
1,Do NOT BUY this game!,"Pros:* The water effects are fantastic, but, thank the nvidia chip for that.Cons:* Deathmatch was boring and not challenging* I got vertigo from lousy ship control* The levels\missions were not challenging:("
1,Whats with the stupid xbox games?,"(Im not 12 im 14). I'm not an xbox lover or owner and i've played lots of games on xbox but all of them were bad. I have played halo but not much and it was ok but this game really was bad. There's nothing you do in the game besides shooting other boats with stupid weapons. I own a gamecube because im a huge nintnedo fan. Gamecube has tons of good games. Whenever there's a good game on xbox that games on gamecube to. There's no point in owning an xbox. Gamecube has games like Super smash bros, luigis mansion, pikmin, eternal darkness, Tony hawk 3,and 4, mario sunshine, starfox, metroid prime. See all this great games. Xbox is the worst system ever."
4,All good BUT the controls are very frustrating!,"Like my title says, this game has it all, mass destruction, flying objects, and my favorite unlockables! Although the game is rated very low and it had poor controls, the water graphics and the game itself is most impressive. Don't judge this game by just reviews, don't even judge it by MINE! Go out and rent this game first. Beileve me, i think you'll enjoy it quite well."
3,Nice Shooter and Blow em up Game,"Excellent Graphics and a fun game in it's own rights.I was excited when I saw there was a Fast shootin' boat racing game but still after playing Hydro Thunder on PS1,this game is second best. (Eventhough Hydro Thunder is not a shooter)"
3,Good change of pace.,"Blood Wake is a high-speed gunboat warfare game. The most impressive aspect of the game is the water physics. The effects are truly amazing and highly believable. The graphics are also pretty darn good. It keeps a fast pace and it is a welcome break when you want a change of pace and to try something different. While this game isn't necessarily highly engaging, it can be a lot of fun. Now that the price has come down a bit, it is worth the purchase."
3,good but gets boring,This is a GREAT game when u first get it so i reccomend renting it i bought it and beat it in 1 week so rent it and dont waste ur money but game play wise graphics r good. A lot of fun until u get to a level nd have to try 10 times to beat it :(
3,Great game until......,"This is a great vehicle combat game to come to the XBOX due to the fact that it takes advantage of the XBOX hardware. This game wasn't toooo hard on NORMAL difficulty until the last level, where I come to think of that level as IMPOSSIBLE. I had to wait until an invincibility cheat came out, and I hardly EVER have to do that with a game, and with that code, the last level was still hard to complete. There is almost NO replay value to this game because who would want to go back and try to beat it on a harder difficult level such as Admiral?! Multiplayer is also bad unless you have the code for Bloodball: Soccer in the water....It is very funny but still not that great!"
4,This Game Rulz,"This game turned out to be a good game. The way the boat moves and gameplay is the greatest. The storyline gets a bit confusing with the wierd names they use for the characters. You have to beat certain levels on certain difficulties to get nice new boats and arenas to use in multiplayer.Some of the levels seem impossible, though. There are no checkpoints to save your progress in the middle of a level. If you like and never get sick of blowing up other boats with many weapons, this is the best game for you."
2,"Well it doesn't totally suck, but.....","I found the graphics in this game quite impressive, however the storyline leaves quite a bit to be desired.You have to complete the storyline mode in order to unlock boats for multiplayer head to head combat, but the missions simply alternate between multiple fairly easy missions followed by one or two that take many attempts.When you can finish the story mode in under a week, the only thing left is head to head play, so don't count on this being one that gets played much after your initial voyage through the storymode."
3,"pretty good, but room for improvement",If you like a fast-pace shooting game then this will do fine for you. The graphics on the boats and water are very good and detailed. The first few missions are really easy (if you have talent in the game) but all of the sudden it gets like really hard and I still haven't beaten it. But if your up for the challenge then you should definitely buy this game.Pros:-great graphics-challenging and interesting missions-pretty good AI-nice variety of weapons-fun and competitiveCons:-really funky controls-takes to many shots to blow up a boat-sudden change of difficulty
4,Great GAME,"This game is great! The things holding it back from being a five star game is you don't get to choose the boat that you use on each level. Also it doesn't have a co-op multi player mode. You should also be able to custamize your boats.Now the positve things: GREAT graphics,not a piece of cake to beat, 3 difficulty settings, and good story line."
3,"Eh, Fun for awhile but not too engaging","Blood Wake is another hit braught by the Xbox. The game looks to be promesing but It's really not that great. The graphics engine for the water is just pure and Amazing. I loved how they desighned the levels of water they really made them look awesome. The game is also great with the boats as you can shoot out many different types of ammo and this is one of those pretty cool run and gun fights except...it's with boats.But the game is lacking. There isn't much to do except run n' gun boats, they don't add anything new to it. The gameplay is good for about 15 minutes but then just gets boring and a little repetitive.ProsGraphicsLil gampeplayWater desighnConGameplay..heheBoring storyCutscenes arnt that greatKina repetitive but we can handle itIn the end I give this jumbo sized Xbox Title a3 out of 5 starsLates."
3,call it a 3.5,"Not a 4 rating but not quite a 3 either. It is interesting but all you do is race around and try to blow up other boats...sums it up. Not a game that you will play over and over, but good for that break from Halo and some others. Worth its current price."
2,Disappointing,"When I bought this game I thought it would be similar to Twisted Metal, but on water. And I also figured the graphics and gameplay would blow TM out of the water. Well....what a major disappointment. Don't get me wrong...the graphics ARE awesome, but the gameplay just flat out (...). Not many weapons to choose from, and the boats are hard to control. Your pirate wannabe sidekick is so annoying that I actually turned the volume off when I played. This just isn't one of those addictive single player games. For multiplayer games it can be fun, but don't buy this game if you don't plan on using the multiplayer mode."
3,A DISAPPOINTMENT...,"I was really looking forward to Blood Wake, as it was one of my most anticipated post launch games. What I got, was a letdown.The game has unbelievable water effects and gameplay is quite fun to play, yet frustrating at times. There are over 25 different type of missions, some incredibly easy others mind boggling difficult. My biggest complaint though, is the lack of story. The game is told through drawings and is poorly done. The voice acting while mediocre becomes annoying and silly at times. The sound is also poor. The battle mode is fun but lacks the maps, boats, and modes to make it replayble. This game could have been much more.All in all, I feel this was a botched effort by Stormfront Studios. It is a decent game but could have been wonderfully done if given the time and effort. My take, give it a rent before you fork over the [PRICE] for this game."
3,It Could Have Been Better,"-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-This game definately has the water thing down. The physics on the boat through the water is superb. It fun just driving the boat around. But, of course, that isn't enough to make a great game. For me, the game became boring REAL quick. The graphics aren't as good as they could be (come on, this is the XBox guys!!) and the level design is slightly on the poor/boring side. With a little bit of inspired innovation, this game could have been really good....even great. But alas, such a game didn't surface.Maybe they will make a sequel with some much needed upgrades? Anyway, this is a rent first title before you buy it."
2,Not the right stuff,"Well this game is really weak, ITS TO SLOW and the controlls are terrible. The one thing i do like about this game is the waves are very neat. The multiplayer mods are very strange compaired to reqular, u can tell they rushed through it to get it out on the market as soon as possible. The ships weapons are all the same and there is nothing really speacil about it.IF U HAVE A PS2 GO BUY: TWISTED METAL BLACKIf U Want A Game Similar To This One Go Buy: CELL DAMAGE, sure Cell Damage is cartoons but its game play and graphics are alot better. It provides alot more. The best one out there is still TMB"
3,defective DVD,"I also experienced problems with the DVD playback during ""Buck Privates"". And it's not just my DVD player, I tried it on two other DVD players and it still has problems playing the first two chapters of ""Buck Privates"". I'm going to return the set for antoher (hopefully good) copy. Otherwise this set is a must-have for Abbott and Costello fans."
4,I'm a completist,"...so I wish these had been chronological across the A/C canon, rather than just the Universal offerings. In other words, there's no RIO RITA! And I assume Ch 2 will NOT contain A/C IN HOLLYWOOD. What a shame that there was no cross-pollenization w/MGM.But, what's here is prime. I remember watching these on Sunday mornings, when they were butchered to death. In a LOT of cases, its as if I'm seeing them for the very first time. Sure, UHF stations took out a lot of the music and the romantic subplots, but the chuckleheads responsible for editing them into a 1.50-hr timeslot w/commercials also trimmed some A/C classic routines!!!!An excellent investment. I'm eager for Ch 2."
4,"The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol 1",It was good to view real comedy from the A & C CD. We experienced the real comedy experience and enjoyed laughing at the shows. A real good presentation from the Best of Abbott & Costello.
2,Another shoddy Universal DVD!!!!!,"I spoke too soon concerning not having problems with these DVD's, so I have decided to come back and edit my review as a warning. Unlike others, I did not have problems with skipping/locking up during ""Buck Privates"". But when I got to watching ""Hold That Ghost"", I DID encounter this problem.I have since returned that set and received a replacement, and time will tell if this one is okay. Sadly, though, it takes a great deal away from having a DVD set in one's collection if one never knows if it is going to act up.The movies in this set are great. How unfortunate that Universal has put out yet ANOTHER in its long line of substandard/shoddy products. (Add this to the DVD's for the ""Airport Terminal Pack"", the ""Back to the Future"" set, and ""The Glenn Miller Story""...all bad experiences with Universal issues!)"
5,Talk about being a kid again on a Sunday morning!,"I remember getting up on a Sunday morning and putting the TV on at 11:30 and watching these great comdians. Just think how I must of felt watching these two guys again. To this day I laugh my posterior off not one on them was a favorite because they were all my favorites. You have to get these I can not wait until May 4th when Volumn II comes out. I will be collecting them all,so get your now don't wait until they are sold out. Remember Sunday mornings will never be the same o dud day. Every body needs to laugh and these will certainly do it."
2,flawed dvd,"I tried to watch In the Navy and the picture started to break up and then eventually froze. It also froze my DVD player, and I had to power it off and then on to get the controls to respond. Another volume contains Naughty Nineties which refused to play at all. Frankly, this kind of poor quality is inexcusable and reflects a cavalier if not a willful and culpable attitude from the manufacturer. I could not recommend any of these A&C dvd's to anyone."
1,Where's Abbott&Costello???,"I know I was just a little kid when I used to watch these guys, but what's up with all the ""singing & music"" I mean, Abbott & Costello crack me up, but you don't see much of them on this entire DVD if you ask me. It's as if ""THEY"" were the guest stars. If you love this sort of stuff, you'll love this DVD. I would recommend ""The Best Of Abbott & Costello Vol. 3"
3,"great movies, just lousy disks","I love watching this comic duo, but the videos get screwed up. Should have used 4 disks, one-sided, for better quality cd's"
5,Hymnal Masterpiece,"I was visiting another church and saw this Hymnal. I started turning the pages and could not stop reading it. It brought back so many memories of my childhood. New songs, old songs, so much variety! Every choir member must have this book!"
4,Buy this book!,Great book! This has many of the songs that you hear but don't normally find in a book. The variety is excellent!
3,Excited and Relieved,"I just ordered the hymnal based on the customer reviews. I attend a white protestant, charismatic church that I love. But, the worship music leaves me wanting because I am accustomed to the african american style of worship. I bought a keyboard and the songbooks included only contain secular folk/international songs that dull my interest in practicing. So, I am excited about getting the opportunity to learn to play some down home gospel songs that will quicken my spirit. Thanks, Amazon."
4,Hymnal,"Great collection of old favorites some with new arrangements, and things new - to me at least."
3,If not a ww2 games maniac don't buy it...,I bought the game two months ago and i was experienced 'cause i had a new call of duty game in my hands!But when i put it in my console i begun rethinking about my choice!First of all the graphic system hasn't change a bit...it brings back memories of old fashioned games with a lot of faults at the graphics.Although it has a nice storyline but this advantage is covered by the bad graphic system!!The graphics are just like Call of Duty 2!We thought that a new title will bring and a new game experience!But Call of Duty 3 is definately not this experience!The only reason i haven't sell the game is because i am a ww2 games maniac so i mast keep it for my collection...It is not worth to buy it unless you are one of the ww2 maniac!!Keep your money and buy something else that may worth it!!
3,Falls short of hype!,"The new features were not significant enough to over come the slow and disconnected story line compared to COD2 which had a map to show the progress of the mission. It was very disconnected. The individual segments have some intensity but you are left with no since of accomplishment with the exception of perhaps three very challenging segment. One in the middle of the game and the last two missions. The second to the last feels as if you finally defeated the (game) but you supprisingly have a final mission! Some missions have too drawn out battles to get to a checkpoint and others have rather frequent ones. Lastly, the music score and ability to control sound effects are essentially nil. Get this game if you are a COD enthusiast but the first two CODs are excellent!"
2,Why this game flat out sucks,"Want to know why you shouldn't buy this game? The unoriginal gameplay and the crippling controls, A army shooter you say? Meet Counter-Strike, Medal of Honer and Battlefield.And the controls are so crappy i didn't even know how to turn around"
3,Not a gammer,I own the computer version and decided to hook up the PS2. Bought the game and found it's a lot more exciting and harder to work. Gotta get my thumbs in gear for this fast action game!
3,fun,"a great game, but there is better out thereplayed this game for a while, i've kinda stopped playing it now"
3,"Fun game, but not on PS2","Call of Duty is really fun, on the PC. Too bad COD3 is only made for Playstation. Difficult to aim/shoot quickly with a game pad."
4,"Great game, lots of action",This is a great game lots of action good images a lot better than (Medal of Honor) games.
5,Very good game !!,"I'll have to admit, that this game is truly a very cool game in my view and one of the best of 2006. This game beats Call of Duty 2 graphics wise, however, unlike 2 and sticking to a solid story line, Call of Duty 3 moves you to different battles so that you can get a full effect of WWII. The game does have its frustration points (like all new games do), however, with time, you pretty much will learn all the new stuff very easy. This game gets a solid A+ in my view and is highly recommended !!"
5,Best game ever,"This is the best game ever. I thought Call of duty 2 was really cool but I got this last night and it was awsome. If you are buying you first ""Call of Duty"" then buy Call of duty 2 big red one.Over all this is the best game ever."
2,sumwhat disapointing,this game is not wat i had expected. i had bought COD 2 big red one last year and i thought it was pretty good but nuthin to the 360 version. but anyway i just bought COD3 yesterday and i wasn't really impressed. the graphics were no better. and the gameplay barly changed at all. there were a couple things however that were improved. one was the health. there was no health bar but instead u duck for cover when u can see the heart beats. another thing was that smoke grenades were put in this one and there is also the melle block thing that i liked. but aside from that nuthin changed. disapointing
5,GREAT WAR GAME!,"This game is awesome! The story is based on actual combat. The actors actually discussed the game with Veterans! Guys who were there! The graphics are great, you get to not only run around killing Germans, but you get to drive tanks, jeeps, etc. This game is awesome! Make sure at the end you watch the stories of the Veterans who shared their experiences with the game makers and role players. Today is Veterans day, and I am proud to be an American and thank the Men and Women who have served and gave the ultimate sacrifice so I be able to chill and play a cool game like this one! Semper Fi!"
4,best pa2 game,"THE BEST GAME EVER FOR THE PS2.The graphics of this is awesome it almost look like the ps3's graphics. the controls are also very easy to master. it is a one player game which can be played in story mode and also online multiplayer,But no 2 players.there are dozens of gun that are AWESOME.This game is about the battles that lead to D-Day. this the best WW2 game i ever played and i hoped it would be yours to."
4,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT TOO SHORT","I got the game because I didn't find any other good games except this. It turned out pretty good, the first big thing that surprised me in Call of Duty 3 is that there is a destructible environment. You can destroy walls and fences but there are limitations like only a part of the building can be destroyed not the whole thing but the fencing can be totally destroyed. Another fun thing is you can use mortars and THAT IS VERY FUN trust me and you have to use a very interesting button to move the mortar but I won't ruin it for you. There are also very detailed weapons in the game like the FG42 and others. The missions are about 20-30 minutes long so you can pass the time quickly and there are some surprises along the way. Very good graphics too; you can see small details of weapons and vehicles. But the game is too short there are only 14 missions. I finished it in 4 days but overall it's a very good game if you like WW2 games buy it! Best game I have!"
3,Good,"History Channel always produces great shows.. this one is excellent. However, I don't see why anyone would spend money to purchase this on DVD when it reruns so often on TV that you could easily record it."
3,Good but not perfect...,"Knowing the history of these blunders and WW II in general pretty well I guess I bought this series out of curiosity more than anything. The footage in each short episode is very good, some of it thrown in and mixed up for effect from unrelated events but some of it I have never seen before.Its not without its errors though, one example during the 'Failure of the Kamikaze' episode was the mention of the abortive Mongol invasion of Japan in the 12th century, when it was actually in the 13th century.Overall, for the novice WW II student and enthusiast its a good general collection of short episodes on the subject. But, for those with a good to excellent knowledge of history and WW II its simply summarized revision with a few gaps.The period footage alone is worth 3 stars."
1,Put me to sleep,I own many WWII documentaries and you just never know when you will find a gem or a clunker. This one is a clunker. It was a disappointment because of the loud background music. I don't really need the music to tell me how to react to what is on the screen. I found the music distracting. I didn't learn anything new from this video that I have not seen in others. I would not recommend buying this one.
5,My Favorite Book,"I have read many books that fall within the ""travel literature"" genre; Motoring With Mohammed is hands down my favorite. I rarely read books twice, but I read this book once every few years and never tire of the way Eric Hansen describes his experiences in Yemen during his quest to recover his lost journals. His eclectic combination of anecdotes are simple but beautifully written. Upon reading this book, you are left with the essence of Yemen, her people, and Mr. Hansen himself. A warning: If you lend this book to a friend, you will never get it back. I am on my seventh or eighth replacement copy!"
5,Excellent for world travellers and armchair adventurers!,"Light hearted, well written tale of a quest to understand the often complicated ways of life in the Middle East. The protagonist enjoyed an adventure that led to respect and understanding for another culture that he hadn't sought nor imagined. A must read!"
5,Loved It,What a wonderful book. He has the perfect balance between action and description...and leaves his ego out of the writing.
5,"Perhaps, one of the best travel books I have ever read.","Having read literally hundreds of travelogues, I must say this is simply one of the finest I have ever run into. Eric's experiences are unusually wonderful, and his writing is magical. His focus on the Yemeni people and their lives and experiences make this book far more engaging than travelogues that focus on personal experiences, interpretations or places visited and described.Kudos Mr. Hansen! I thought I had travelled enough and read enough about other people's travels. Your experiences are illuminating and incomparable.-a"
2,Boring.... what did the clouds do next?,"Not my type of book, overly descriptive fluff with no insight. Only gave it 2 stars because I'm sure there was some good stuff to come but I couldn't stay awake more than 5 pages to get in to it."
3,Not for over 80 inch trailers,"Despite what the title says, these lights are not sufficient for trailers over 80 inches wide. Over 80 inch trailers must have yellow marker lights on the side and a light bar on the rear, between the tail lights. I give these lights 3 stars because they appear to be well made. A dunking in salt water will be the true test, however."
5,compelling reading with deep insights into small town people,"I enjoyed reading this book a lot. The end is weak and cliche, but the insights into the life of one of those generally praised small communities were absolutely fascinating. The description of ordinary citizens and the scapegoats they need in order to maintain their ordinariness and the violence that is there waiting for a pretext to be released make this book one of the most interesting ones I've read for a long time. And as I hate the stupidity of action movies and don't really like Stephen King there was nothing, apart from the end, that could disappoint me. I simply couldn't put it down. Gerhild Ahnert"
2,Did Stephen King actually READ this book?,"Church of the Dead Girls was terribly disappointing, made more so by the glowing rave credited to Stephen King on the back cover. The narrative was incredibly flat and boring. I kept reading solely for the promised climax which never came. Very disappointing."
5,Nothing will seem normal in this small town again!,"In my stereotypical small town, I will, for some time, gaze a little too long at the seemingly normal faces for a glimpse of the snakes under the surface. This book was familiar to me in that I know the small-town mentality is a truth and ignorance can often seem like sweet naivete. I can't stop thinking about the story. It snuck up on me and is resting on my shoulders. Great book"
3,Slow moving disappointing novel.,"This book is slow in the telling. Being a first person account, the book gives so much detail, most unnecessarily, that it slows any momentum. A person finds 3 dead girls in someone's attic with the left hand's missing. Then the search begins for the killer. What happens before the finding of the bodies is the belly of this beast. A lot of superfluous details about characters history, lives, etc is not needed. The ending is so not dramatic or incisive, the twists and hints of who the killer may be are completely false and forced. The fist and last 1/3 of this book are tedious, the middle part actually had a head of steam going until we are bogged down with unnecessary information. There is a great thriller in these pages, a competent editor would have slimmed this one down to read quicker and build suspense."
2,Imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery,"The Greek translator below is correct, you can't possibly compare Dobyns with Stephen King because King is a hugely superior writer! The New York Times cocktail party snob's comments were obviously stolen from Douglas Winter's book on Stephen King, The Art of Darkness. Also I found the characters very unappealing."
4,Not just an old mystery,"I found this book to be a relief from the ordinary, cheesy mystery novels that have been spilling out over the years. While some people feel that this book is a big let down at the end, I don't really think that it was. If one is looking for a suspense mystery it could have been, but if the book is read for the character development and how each element of the plot and book is related to the others, the book is great."
5,If Hitchcock was alive today...,"If Hitchcock were alive today I'm sure he would be drawn to this dark, psychological thriller about a small town caught in a maelstrom of suspicion. Dobyns draws a dozen memorable characters and the town itself becomes a character; the reader gets a sense of the community as more than the sum of it's parts. A worthy successor to PSYCHO and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."
2,more of a chore than a thrill,"As a reader who, for better or worse, is driven to finish any book I start, ""The Church of Dead Girls"" was an absolute nightmare for me. The characters are completely wooden, and the meandering narrative drains every ounce of suspense right out of the novel. I can't imagine that finding a better book for your buck would be too difficult."
2,A slow paced mystery at best...,"I'm an avid reader and enjoy well put together novels but this isn't one. I continually waited for it to pull me in and it just didn't happen. I constantly found myself skipping over rambling details in the hopes I might somehow get involved with this book. After 200 pages, it's in the trash can. <sigh>"
5,Will keep you reading far into the night....,"The Church of Dead Girls reminds you of an early Stephen King novel, the kind you read all night long. Also brings to mind the underlying life of a small town, a la Twin Peaks. Fortunately, the book focuses on the effect the disappearances and murders have on a small town, not the crimes. And in the end you have one pretty scary witch-hunt"
3,"Too long, too many characters, too little intrigue","The book starts out in such a way which pulls the reader in with heart pounding alarm. The story then dilutes and becomes a whos who of small town NY. Boring and confusing. You almost have to draw out a tree of characters to keep them straight or memorable. The book then culminates showing the face of just one of those introduced earlier as the ultimate villian, who cares, snore.... I didn't know the villian and never would suspect him anyway. This book just took too long to read with too little to show. What scared Stephen King so much I will never know..."
3,Who was who?,"This book is very well written, and the quality of the story was exceptional, though through story-telling one shouldn't have to face the repetition of small town faces. So many characters were introduced that it became increasingly difficult to distinguish ""who was who"".The viewpoint of the teacher was somewhat accurate, however I was left wondering exactly how he knew so much.And the ending was wrapped up very well-although somewhat disappointing.I believe had the characters been easier to grasp, the book would have been easier to identify with."
3,2 1/2 stars,"Dobyns shows us a classical case of overwriting in The Church of the Dead Girls. H goes to great lengths to describe the town, the people, even the crime, but not nearly, enough time with the resolution and capture of the murderer.On the dust jacket, there is a quote from Stephen King that states he does not expect to read a more frightening novel this year. Well, he must not plan to read any other books, because this was far from frightening. Maybe if King had written it himself, it would have been better."
1,Failed in the Execution,"This book had real possibilities. The title is good, and the premise is good. For me, however, the execution failed. I found the book to be far too long and too laden in the middle. I do not doubt that the attempts to find the girls would be a huge issue in the real world, but in the novel it becomes tedious, and the murders and violence later in the book seem less motivated by a real need within the plot and more like throwing a bone out to keep the readers interested. Unfortunate that the book couldn't live up to the expectations."
4,Bloody good read,"I must say at times I did wish the story would speed up just a little, but that was only because I only had limited time slots in which to read this novel. I love it and now I have to buy some more of Stephen Dobyns work to get another fix."
3,interesting.........,"I read this book and I thought it was captivating. I felt like I knew many of the characters very well. Plus the descriptions were never boring or tedious. The ending may have been a bit of a disappointment, but overall, I enjoyed this book and thought it was brilliant in its own right."
5,unputdownable,"I picked up this book by chance and was expecting another ""seial killer terrifies town"" type thriller. What I found was a well-written, intelligent and compulsive account of what fear does to a community. The gradual disintegration of the sleepy, dull town into a suspicion-laden, self-destructive gang of vigilantes was beautifully described and I think the author managed to create a climate of terror far more powerful than if he had stuck to what has become almost a formula for the mystery/horror novel. I am looking forward to reading more of his books."
2,Very disappointing!,"This was the most slow and boring book I have ever read. The writing is good but the story is very boring. I almost did not finish it. I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. There seemed to be far too much unecessary ""filler"" in this book also. I agree, did Stephen King actually read this book or is this guy a friend???"
2,The ending is so week it lets the whole book down.,"Sorry : - ( It start's out OK Dobyns lets us know who's who. Now the story starts to get good, now a little better, then you guess who done it. The ending drops out. What a let down."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G !!!!!,"I expected a 'thriller', especially given Stephen King's commentary prominently displayed on the cover; however, I had to force myself to read the entire book. Such drudgery! Although I'll admit that parts are well written, it is painfully slow. Only about the last 50 pages had any real tension.Perhaps if it hadn't been billed as a 'horror thriller' I would have approached it differently and enjoyed it more.Also very annoying were the author's arbitrary changes in 'person'. The story is purportedly told from one guy's viewpoint, but we often are ""in the heads"" of other characters. This can change from paragraph to paragraph, and clearly the main 'storyteller' would not have been privy to the thoughts and privacies of the other characters. Very strange, and I saw no need for the ""1st person"" viewpoint at all."
3,glamarahhh,"This being the first work of Dobyns I have read, I had no expectations. From the first line I was hooked, the entire novel was read in one sitting. All in not well because it does not end well. What a disappoinment in the last few chapters, he turned this captivating work of a creepy social commentary of small town paranoia into a dreadful over-the-top cartoonish who-done-it. However, due to the author's great command of the English language I will pick up another one of his works and cross my fingers."
1,The Church of Dead Prose,"This has to be among the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish. The prose style reads like something ground out by a twelve-year-old and one cries out for even a two-dimensional character to relieve the tedium of the one-dimensional ones Dobyns has created. It also seems obvious that he completely ran out of his small fund of ideas at the end of the novel. With no attempt to build tension or even to explain the actions of the killer he simply ends the book. Personally, I'd rather he'd finished it a few hundred pages earlier."
2,BORING<BORING and BORING,"Stephen King has a glowing remark on the coverabount how great this book is. I don't know whick book Mr. King was thinking about but it wasn,t this one."
4,An excellent psychological thriller,"It is very interesting to find a thriller that manages to progress slowly without ever becoming boring. Stephen Dobyns lets us see - in excruciating detail sometimes - into the hearts and minds of a small-town populace that are shaken by the disapperances of several local girls. The psychological aspects intertwine with a poetic prose that is hard to resist; and perhaps what really makes this book work is the lucid and believable character portraits mr Dobyns has created. This is one of the better books I've read all year - exciting, enlightening and entertaining."
4,A richly woven tale of evil and paranoia in a small town.,"I enjoyed Mr. Dobyns' narrative writing style, and marveled at his ability to weave richly developed characters into a story of evil festering beneath the skin of a small town. An excellent read - highly recommended."
2,Nothing thrilling about this book,I bought this book based on the reviews I read here. I don't think I will be doing that again. This book never took off for me. I read it thinking it would get better but it never did. The characters were not developed enough to get to know them. This made it impossible to care when the killer was revealed
2,Very Disappointing,"After struggling to read this book, I realized it was not well-written. I did not care about the characters, I did not like the writing style. I know I'm in the minority of the reviewers, but if you must read this book, you may borrow it from me. I would rather read Stephen King, given the choice.BETH"
3,"With the number of ""10"" reviews, I was expecting much more.","This book started at a decent pace, but quickly moved to humdrum. The narrarator jumped around too much, made too many suppositions, and did a poor job in the telling of the story. Additionally, the ""bad guy"" went from being an upstanding figure in the community to a homicidal lunatic in about 2 paragraphs. The change and tie-in were totally unbelievable. The best, and only realistic parts in the book are his description of small town life. I haven't read any other Dobyn's books, and after this one, aren't likely to"
5,You've gotta give this one a hand...,"Dobyns' latest novel will have you looking at friends, neighbors and co-workers in a whole new way. A chilling glimpse of the secrets, prejudices and diabolical evil which loom just beneath the surface of a small town's seemingly idyllic facade. As you turn the pages in the frantic hunt for the murderer, you may find yourself asking, ""Could this happen in my neighborhood?"" And that realization is what makes this novel so frightening"
3,Totally Mis-labeled,"Although this book was a good story, it was NOT a thriller/mystery/horror book. The characters were established well but the story dragged in some parts. If you like John Irving I think you'd like this book, if you're looking for Stephen King forget it."
4,Character-driven story a page turner!,"Just like the cover says, the story pulls you in from the very first line. Dobyns' ability to create finely tuned characters and in-depth histories is what kept me going in this book. Far scarier than any supernatural entity, the kidnappings and subsequent repercussions in this small town are highly believable and very disturbing. The last hundred pages kept me reading into the night and the climax culminated in a very satisfactory ending. Though I figured out early on who was not to be trusted (all from ONE descriptive sentence), the story and the talent of Dobyns made the whole read worthwhile."
2,STPEHEN KING WAS WRONG,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE BORING AND EXTREMELY SLOW.IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO READ ON A LONG FLIGHT TO NOWHERE, TRY THIS BOOK"
3,Whole Lotta Mystery,"This book was a bit weak. There was a lot of mystery and suspicion and I was expecting a big payoff. The ending didn't satisfy me. I was hoping the murderer(s) had been different. I think the book would have been much more powerful. There was too much unnecessary information. You would think all the details the author put into the characters and the events would have payed off. The author did make an interesting point about human beings at the end that I completley agreed with. But, I don't think I would recommend this book."
4,Flawed but still delicious,"The Church of Dead Girls has an excellent plot and Mr. Dobyns has great command of the English language. However, I thought that the story could have improved by treating Janice, the first victim, as something more than a slut. As she is, she was much too one dimensional and encouraging of misogyny. In fact, except for Sadie, Dobyns seems to dispise his women characters. Usually they are either sluts or victims. If the book had a strong female character, I would have enjoyed it more. Don't get me started on Harriet. The characters Aaron and Ryan didn't exactly float my boat either. Aaron was basically a misogynistic gigolo, and Ryan was sort of embarrasing, with all his simpering. I would say the characters I liked best were the narrator, Sadie, Jesse and Shannon, and, especially, Jaime Rose. In conclusion, I would say Mr. Dobyns just needs to flesh out his characters and love them a bit more. And maybe give them some recommendable characteristics."
3,"Good Story, But Could Have Been Told Better","Dobyn's tale was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages, but there is something about his writing style that prevents me from giving ""The Church of Dead Girls"" a rave review. Dobyn's style is too expository; he seems to be relating a series of events rather than telling a story. An interesting read, but by no means a classic."
3,Creepy,"My wife and I disagreed about this book. She hated the whole marxist sub plot. I thought it added to the energy. Besides that though, this book is creepy. I found that the feeling stayed with me even after I put the book down. I was disappointed with the ending. The killer could have been anyone, but Dobyns hangs it on one of the least interesting characters. Still, read this book. I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,bor-ing,"I liked the first couple of chapters but then I got so bored b/c I felt I still hadn't gotten to the ""meat"" of the book. Turned out there was no meat. I found the whole Chihani/Aaron part to be pointless and the the Malloy/Leimbach part came from left field. There was no continuity."
4,skin-crawling,"I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THIS LITTLE GEM. YES,THERE ARE DULL MOMENTS IN THE BOOK BUT OVERALL NOT A WAST OF TIME. THE ENDING LEFT ME IN AWE AND MY SKIN CRAWLING. BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WON`T BE SORRY."
3,Red marks all over costume and too short for a maternity dress,"This item arrived just in time for Halloween - that's a plus.My husband and I went as a doctor & nurse combo and all-in-all everyone liked our costumes.However, my costume needed some work before I could wear it in public.When I took the costume out of the package - it had red marks ALL over it. Looked like ink from the cross on the hat. It took lots of time and energy to try to get the stains out and they were still visible after many attempts with stain remover.The ""dress"" was also REALLY short. Maybe I'm more modest (or taller) than most pregnant women - but I don't think anyone wants to show their butt cheeks when they walk. haha. I ended up having to buy red scrub bottoms to wear underneath."
2,"Light ""gift"" Bag","Just received my One Pound Bag of Red Pistachio Nuts and am a quite displeased with the bag I received. First off, the ""gift bag"" they state the nuts come in is nothing more than a clear plastic bag with a white twist tie...was expecting something a little nicer if they are using the term girft bag.Also the one pound bag was not one pound....i have a kitchen scale and i weighed to bag to see how honest the company is and it turns out that it only weighs 383 grams. One pound should equal 453 grams so they shorted me a whole 70 grams of nuts.Won't be buying again thats for sure!"
2,Red Pistachio Nuts,"It is hard to find red pistachio nuts, but it is a Christmas tradition to have them - so, I had to resort to ordering online. The nuts were perfectly fine. The only issue I had was that while the nuts were $10.50, the shipping was $9.95. I didn't realize it until after, as I had multiple items in my order from multiple vendors. My fault for not paying attention - but, to basically charge as much for shipping as you do the product - a very small item - is ridiculous."
5,just what I wanted,"We have had a trash compactor almost 25 years (OK, we replaced it once) and prefer this type of bag over the plastic ones. Seems like I have to constantly adjust the plastic ones while these stay in place and never leak. Finding a generic version at a great price is a boon."
5,Compactor trash bags,Have compactor and have been buying these since they are a lot cheaper!! Work just as good as the ones I use to buy at sears
5,"Paper, not plastic!","Paper bags are better than plastic for a trash compactor, especially if you use a heavy duty stapler such as the Arrow P22 to close the bags when you they are full after you replace them in the trash compactor."
5,Great buy on a hard-to-find product!,"We have a fairly new-ish whirlpool trash compactor and ran out of bags. Having just bought the house over the summer, we didn't know where to buy bags. I like the paper because I see them as being more environmentally friendly, but local stores only carry plastic trash compactor bags, go figure!! Anyway, these worked great for our compactor and the price was good, too!"
3,Not many familiar songs for the youngsters,The only song my daughter knew was stop in the name of love and wasn't too interested in the rest of the cd. It's okay for adults too.
3,Accurate but extremely short,"Bought the kindle edition of this book as part of a research paper I was working on for which I needed a good general knowledge of American cultural attitudes in the 1950s, especially in regards to sex and violence. While the book was helpful it only presents the barest summary of any of the topics because it is so short. Not a bad book, because often such summaries can be very useful for quickly gaining a overarching understanding, but it absolutely is not worth $23 for the amount of material that is given."
2,Two stars for Kindle version,"I keep looking for a copy of this book for myself, but they are extremely expensive when or if they can be found.I keep looking at the Kindle version--which is at least three times more than I care to pay for a book that has flaws in its execution.The flaws can be seen if you download the sample. Mathematical formulas translate just fine, which sometimes is a problem with math-heavy books, but after the first few formulas, there is a graphic which is useless--only the text made it into the book. From reading the surrounding text, these missing graphics leave the book sorely unsatisfactory.The publisher could have done a much better job--and they could turn this text over to Dover so they could satisfy the demand for paper copies of this classic."
3,OK.,"Ok book but hard to follow unless you are versed in the insurance business, etc.Hard to follow at times."
2,Didn't work for me,Not bad but it did not work for me. You might like it. I picked it up for free and if you can get it for free give it a shot
5,The Flinstones Big trouble in Bedrock - GBA,This game is fun but a little on the hard side it only get's hard in till you get to level 9 then I don't know I haven't got past that level yet but it is a really fun game I would recommend anyone to get this game. Go get this game you'll have ton's of fun it really is a really great game you'll never want to put this game down if your into the Flinstones like I am.
4,passwords,This doesent have any poasswords either. it is fun i just thought it would be better withe passwords or save slots.
1,I did not enjoy this book.,"This book was recommended through the Amazon ""Book Finder"" based on my interest in intrigue/spy, etc. titles. I bought it, but wish I hadn't. I never really understood what the author was trying to tell us about Peter or his situation. Although it's a quick read, I actually forgot to finish it and found it several days later in my study, face down, with about 5 pages left to read. I won't try this author again."
2,Peter up at the half.....loses by one.,"This book was recommended by the online `Book Finder'. This was the first (and most likely the last) Sanders book I've read. I finished this book in four days, it was the last half of the book that took the last three. The first half of this book was awesome, I couldn't put it down. Somewhere in the second half of this book it starts winding down. It becomes rather predictable and monotonous."
3,Lacking any suspense or depth of character,"If you need a quick easy read for a dismal weekend, here's the book for you. No intellect required. An easy read with an easy-flowing storyline. I read until the last page and didn't know it was actually the last page, so don't look for suspense here. My first Sanders book, so I'll try another before I give up."
5,A treasure for cinema buffs especially,"Featuring more than 125 full color photographs, Frank Thompson's The Alamo: The Illustrated Story Of The Epic Film is an amazing tour of ""The Alamo"", from director John Lee Hancock, starring Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid, Jason Patric, and more. ""The Alamo"" was the first theatric film about the brutal battle in over 40 years; The Alamo: The Illustrated Story Of The Epic Film includes a point-by-point summary of historical events, an extensive tour of casting, costuming, historical recreations and set design, the full movie script, and more. A treasure for cinema buffs especially, and the perfect companion volume to anyone who enjoys and appreciates the power ""The Alamo""movie has had in bringing history to life."
1,What Bluegrass???,"If this is bluegrass I am Batman, Ironman, and Bullwinkle Moose. lol Maybe one song out of all 3 CDs would qualify as bluegrass for me and not a very good version at that.Decent COUNTRY Gospel, one might say. Very good vocals, decent guitar but really POOR banjo (what very little one was used) very mediocre fiddle and mandolin.ALl in all I would not buy it again.... Sorry."
3,It Could Help,"Louise Hay's writing has been around for a very long time. So long that some New Agers repeat things that she said 30 years ago as if it is some proven truth - one example is the idea that you choose your own parents before you come to this life. That's not a fact, people. That's an idea that people latched onto because it makes them feel better. Another is that anyone can heal themselves and that all illness comes from your thoughts. I'm sure the five-year-olds dying of leukemia, etc did not cause their own illness from their thoughts. Yet because she was saying this back in the day, it has evolved into a tenet in New Age thinking. Louise had cancer and spontanteously recovered. Because this happened for her, she has made a lot of money telling other people that they can do the same. Maybe some of them can, and if you know nothing about how your thoughts affect your physical body, this book might give you some insight. Just remember that what she says is her opinion, not fact."
3,"Love Yourself, Heal Your Life Workbook","I bought the whole ""Heal Your Life"" series, including this workbook. Its selfhelp, an interactive guide to start or continue your healing journey. In this one she tells her story and how she over came her past. My story is similiar, as I am sure most people that buy this book will say. It's a hard read (too many tiggers), but if you are serious about healing your past it's a great tool to have."
4,"Love Yourself, Heal Your Life Workbook",Great resource book for therapist/counselors. Good exercises to incorporate in therapy sessions.
3,"Great book, lots of help and goes great with the actual book...Love yourself, heal your life.","Excellent resource to go with the book...Love yourself, heal your life. I highly recommend this workbook to help really understand what she is trying to teach you."
1,WizDog Indoor Potty System,I was very disappointed in this item...ordered for my mother-in-law's dog and the dog won't go near it! She is now using to put her plants on! Would not recommend!
1,this stuff stinks to high heaven,"I got this for my 2 dogs, i wanted them to have the benifit of omega 3's but one dog wont touch it and while the other likes it just fine when added to their food, it smells really really bad, like rotten fish. I will not be buying this again!"
3,Bottle,"The dogs loved the salmon oil, but the bottle leaked and kept getting all over the place. I'm afraid to buy another bottle because of that"
5,My Parson Russell Terrier Loves This Supplement,This product is a healthy addition to my dog's BLUE BUFFALO dog food. His coat sheds less and is more shiny. We had problems with the first two bottles as we received them with large dents. The product does not require refrigeration and does not have a nasty fish smell. Amazon was very helpful with resolving the dented bottle issues with efficient exchanges.
2,"Every bottle I've tried, the Pump leaks all over","The oil inside is fine, but they must be using a cheap pump! After buying this product for 2-3 years (because it was well priced) I finally swore it off, because I'm so sick of having yellow fish oil all over the cabinet where I keep it. It's hard to clean off! Now I'm trying other brands."
2,"Smelly, leaks, and so far ineffective","I have a golden retriever who has been suffering from dry skin for the past 6 months or so. In search of a solution, I purchased this salmon oil with very high hopes due to the great reviews. However, the bottle is flimsy and the pump leaks leading to a very stinky and messy situation. It is super gross when I try to add a few pumps of the oil to my dog's food and a drop splashes on me by accident. The smell is very strong and lingers even after being washed with soap! The worst is when it gets on my clothes. The container is very oily and I have to put a dish under it to catch the leaks. The scent of fish oil is very unpleasant. Everyone in my household hates it. However, this could all be overlooked if it did wonders for my dog's skin. After nearly a month of use however, he is still as flaky as ever.Two stars because, he does like the taste. I have tried giving him fish oil pills before and he would avoid those like the plague."
1,"Leaky, smelly, squirts all over AND my dog won't eat her food!","I was excited to get this item based on the positive reviews. I can't tell you how much I hate this product!! The slightest touch to the pump will squirt out super-smelly salmon oil. My arm and counter were full of it this morning (the first time using this product). When I finally was able to get some in my dog's dish it came out in loads and the bottle leaked something fierce. I checked the tightness of the neck and it was good. I don't know what is causing the leakage, but the smell was horrid. Then, on top of that, my dog (a siberian husky who LOVES salmon!) turned her nose on her food and wouldn't eat it. If I could, I'd return this product in a heartbeat!!"
5,"Fixed my pup's dry, flaky skin - and she loves the taste!","My Boston Terrier was having a some skin issues (flaky, dry skin) so I did some research and found that Omega 3 oil (or Salmon Oil) was supposed to do the trick. I'm not big on giving my dog meds, so the idea of something that went right on her food was appealing. Let me tell you, she loves this stuff! She freaks out whenever I start the pump, just knowing her yummy salmon oil over dry dog food is on its way. Not only does she love it, but her coat has never looked better. It's shiny, healthy, and no more flaky, dry, itchy skin for her. Yay! And it lasts a really long time too. I bought a new bottle about 60 days ago and I'd say I have a few weeks left. The only downside is that she smells like a fish house right after she eats, but I thin that's a small price to pay! I'm really happy with this product!"
5,service and quality of items,"I would like to say I got my order on time and it was exactly what I wanted, couldn't find it at anystores or pharmacies so that was great. This company was excellent with their customer serviceand I would definately use them again to find an item. 5 stars for sure I would recommend them to anyoneneeding something special."
4,A keeper,"A very good book. The charater Tempus has been one of my favorites since the first Thieve's World book I ever read, and he has evolved much since then. I like the way this story evolved and beleive the ending will please any fan of Tempus."
1,Not what I thought,I should have looked deeper into the book itself and not just reviews. A kids book really. Just not what I expected more than a nbad book in itself.
5,Beautiful illustrations and history,This is a beautiful book and includes many details of St. Francis of Assissi's life. I purchased a copy for my godson for his birthday and also for my children as well.
2,A light-weight Franciscan story,"I purchased this because of the cover (oh yah, some of us do!) and the author. It should have been in the childrens section as it concentrates on the ""pretty"" part of Francis' story. Nice pictures, but not for someone seriously interested in the story of Francis' life."
5,Great book for all!,"I teach second grade in a public school in a large Catholic nieghborhood. I get invited to many first communions. I am not Catholic, but growing up in this nieghborhood I know a lot about this deep faith. The story of St.Francis reaches out to everyone no matter thier religion. It has always interested me. So when this book was released I borrowed it from the library. I was taken back by it. I now buy this book for all of my students that receive their first communion, and I personally inscribe each one. My students love this story!"
5,Not in My Backyard!,"Totally in agreement. I'm tired of friends and co-workers passive-aggressive machinations because I was smarter than they were. This book tells it from our side; the side that never cares to have the jungle gym in the backyard, the mine-field of toys on the carpet and the smelly, sticky fingers. Hate me if you must, but at least I can say ""No underage pregnancy worries in my house"". And, I can still wear a size 2 at 46 years of age!!"
1,A horrible book!!!,"This book was beyond horrible. Instead of giving real reasons that many people choose not to have kids, it went on and on about selfish reasons. I don't want kids but it's not because I want to save up for a mansion, sports car, buy all designer clothes and shoes. God, come on!!! This book wasn't even clever enough or witty enough to be funny-just insulting. Only a small portion actually deal with real reasons for not having kids: freedom.Please don't waste your money on this. I'll sell you mine for $1 if you're really desperate to read this trash."
1,Not helpful,I purchased three books on this subject and this one was not helpful to me at all. I would not recommend this book!
3,"Ok, but not as good as others","I got a few books on the subject of kid-free lifestyle, and this one left me flat. Much of it just wasn't funny, more like a ""how to"" pamphlet. Too many obvious subjects and areas to skip over....It's *OK*, but no better."
4,"Cute title, cute book","Unfortunately, ""cute"" is the best word I can find to describe this book. It wasn't very informative in the sense that it didn't raise too many points that made me think, ""Hmm, I hadn't thought of that."" But it is a fun take on the decision to remain childfree. The book seemed slightly more aimed toward girls - animated pictures of girls wearing cute outfits (that they can afford and wear without getting them ruined, because after all, they have no kids) in their cute apartments, sipping cute cocktails. But I think for a light read, something fun and not very controversial, this book would be a good choice. For something that raises valid points in a VERY humorous way that will keep you nodding your head in agreement, read ""I Hate Other People's Kids."""
2,Surface Book,"The book tries to be colorful about the child decision, and unfortunately, it doesn't dig deep into the issue of whether to have a child or not. Most of the ideas are pretty common sense and straight forward. Other books are probably better."
1,Should have saved my money.,Seems geared toward women who are looking for quick and easy comebacks and put downs to sling at the rude baby club crowd . Irreverent. Not a good read if looking for something with substance. Quite funny if just looking to sling mud.
2,Disappointing,"I'm rather disappointed with this calendar. The ""Words of Wisdom"" are pretty bland. I hoped there'd be some inspirational thought or something like that, but it's rather boring."
2,Not much wisdom (2003 edition),"Based on my purchase of the 2003 edition, I won't be buying this one. Having read a couple of his books, I expected something uplifting, inspiring, and at least a little bit ""wise"". Most days the Words of Wisdom are nothing of the sort. They are mostly just quotes or thoughts. Buy a book instead - at least you can preview that before buying."
1,Extraordinarily amateurish tribute cd,"Who was willing to pay money for this group of musicians to record this ""Holiday Inn Lounge Band"" tribute to Macca is beyond me. Honestly, I only got it on a whim, and I liked the artwork. Sometimes something is so bad it's good, but this is just PLAIN bad. Faltering playing, bad karaoke vocals; avoid if your intention is to actually listen to this!"
2,THESE CDs ARE NOT THE COMPLETE SHOW!,"I have both of ""Sinbads Sounds of the 70s"" shows. I cherish them ! (As a matter of fact, just watched them about 2 weekes ago!), unfortunately, they are both on a VHS Tape, since that was the format that we could record at the time. I have both shows, and on each show, each performer did at least 3 songs. If you buy this, you are cheating yourself...HBO Should have released both of these shows on DVD already"
3,Everage assortment.,"The Gift contained an interesting assortment, but lacked in quantity. In most cases there were only two or three items for the sweets. The 'biscoti' or whatever were were small swirls about the size of a quarter dusted with a salty cheese mix - uninteresting and not enough to serve several people as a snack. In all it was OK, but not something that would be purchased again."
4,Common Sense Advice,"David Dorris in his ""Third Edition of Life is Too Short: Life is What We Make It"" provides the reader with common sense advice on living a full and happy life. It is always good to be reminded that ""Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it."" Thank you David for sharing lessons learned in a life well lived.-Susan Collins,Midwest Writing Center, Davenport, Iowa"
2,Cute but a little too Cute,"This DVD claims to have subtitles but only the ""Opera"" the final 15 min. is subtitled. The slap-stick comedy is fun but heavily over-played. I would not recommend this unless you are a Britten freak or you have young teens with a love of slap-stick comedy that you want to introduce to opera."
4,A Delight to Enjoy,"This production is ideal for young children. Most with an interest in music would find something in it to stimulate further investigation and study. But alas I have not been a child in well over forty years, yet I find it just as enthralling as any grade schooler. Funny thing, in those days I was into mainly Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, etc. Only later in life did I have an interest in this ""kid stuff"". If that makes me an old kid, so be it. Approach this work with an open mind, try and remember what it felt like to be a child, and chances are you will enjoy this. So will the children in your life, if they have any real interest in music."
1,Yawn,"Don't flame me, I love Mr Browne's political writing and I voted for him. But this book was real hard to finish. Like it or not we are part of society and if we all make up our own feel good morality, look forward to this country falling even faster and harder. I'm real unimpressed by someone who decides he'd be happier without seeing his daughter and sez ""bye-bye"". Again, I love his politics, but can I vote for this guy again?"
5,A classic,My husband and I read this book in our late teens when book first came out. Book made a HUGE impression on our young truth-seeking minds. We believe it to be one of the BEST books EVER. A real classic. These reviews are 100% spot on!
2,A bit odd...,Some of the ideas are unrealistic and the author seemed pushy. Other ideals made sense but would be hard to achieve.
1,"this guy is nuts, and stupid",really short sited and thin arguments from a crazy right wing lunatic. not worth it except as a guide of how NOT to find happiness/freedom
4,Personal Freedom for everyone to grasp,"I recommended this book to several people who all expected, due to Harry's political role in the libertarian party, to be a book of politics. What many don't understand is that the libertarian party is one with the goal of eliminating politics. Letting people think for themselves and act for themselves. Don't read this book, if you don't want to take personal responsibility for your actions. This book shows that self reliance is key to avoid life's traps. YOU are all YOU have. Read the book, even if it's only to confirm what you think you already know."
5,Don't Read This Book Unless You Want to Change Your Life!,"I'm not kidding. I look for the old out-of-print paperback and when I find one I usually find a person to give it to. It has changed lives. The premise of the book is that we all draw nice little boxes around ourselves (like a chalk box on the sidewalk) and then say that we can't get out of the box. This book shows you not only how to get out of the box but why you should want to. (Yes, Harry Browne is running for president on the Libertarian ticket.) I gave a copy of this book away, to a coworker who was going on vacation for a week; and when she came back to work on the following Monday she quit her job. This has happened more than once to people who have read this book. So, don't say I didn't forewarn you. Enjoy and get ready for changes."
5,strong and easily stretchable,very strong and easily strechable tie down rope. The hooks at the appears to be of metal and looks very strong. I used it to tie down a uhaul medium size box to hand truck without much effort.
2,A Hand Tool Only,As advertized this is really just a hand tool - not useful as a Sawzall accessory - so don't be deceived by the looks of the tang
1,Hands Free Ear Bud,"This item worked great. Sound received was outstanding, and folks I spoke with said, it sounded great. Sorry to say, it only lasted a couple of days, before the flimsy wiring fell apart. Vendor was great but again, the item was manufactured cheaply. Figured the cost of returning item just wasn't worth the time and effort."
3,"Fine , but not so precise","'working in high luxury hotel group wih many VIP's. Expected more specific details and oinstrucions from this book, but generally research and results that are brought in this book, are more then interesting .Not for professionalists but good guide."
5,Excellent book - A must-read if targeting the affluent!,"I have always been a big fan of Matt Oechsli's writing - his monthly column in Registered Rep magazine and his other books - are always right on the money. Matt's done it again with this book. If you want to know how to think like the affluent and gain them as your clients, then I suggest you order this book right now. If you want 2005 to be better than 2004, read this book and implement what it says!"
5,Wonderfully written...A must read book for all involved in selling.,"Selling to the affluent is different from selling to any other market. As with any selling, you must know your market; and this book provides you with the perfect roadmap. If you follow and apply the strategies and techniques outlined in this book, and possess the confidence required, you will without a doubt, not only attract and serve the affluent, you will also become affluent."
3,Kind of bulky,"I purchased these sunglasses and am still contemplating on whether to keep them or not. The YSL on the side is very cute and is probably my favorite part of the sunglasses. However, the frontal view shows that they are very bulky. I am used to the big, trendy sunglasses, but these are even bigger. That part doesn't bother me all that much, but something is just off with them. Perhaps it is because there is no curve on the top portion of the sunglasses, just straight across, making them kind of masculine? Considering they are YSL sunglasses the price is very hard to beat. They come with a nice, large white leather case and a silky sunglass bag."
3,Yep! Kind of bulky!,"If you're looking for big sunglasses, these would work for you! Actually, they don't have the right curvature I think, and look a little bit masculine. Anyway it blocks the shine very well without making everything too dark!(which is what I was looking for). However I like the logo at the sides and the white leather case!"
4,I like Chicken Noodle Soup!,"I really don't care wat other people think of the song ""Chicken noodle Soup"" cuz it is awesome and great 2 dance 2!"
3,CBGBs carried overseas,"A 1985 concert with three pieces and a couple of guest stars. The real thrust of Wendy's amazing erotic performance is constantly undermined by hyperactive editing with too many close-ups of bass player Greg Smith (as great as he plays and as cool as he looks), too many of the same audience reaction shot - the first row shown over and over again, basically no closeups of the drummer. WOW is never caught head to toe in a tight *one*.Added to that, her powerful voice is mixed too far back. Can't say she's got the most melodious voice but that primal scream starting at her heels, snaking up past that black string bikini, and erupting through her voice box should be the loudest instrument on stage.Still, we have an important DVD. and one which cries out for a proper re-edit, re-mix."
2,Typical 1980s hair band sludge,"The footage itself was okay, but this really wasn't one of the high points in WOW's career. She drags a very average bunch of hard rock musicians from LA over to London to back her on a solo tour. The guitar player is one of the lamest Van Halen clones I've ever seen. Lemmy from Motorhead shows up for a tune, but the whole thing is an endurance test to watch. Forgettable."
4,Thule Roof Rack 445 F-150 Ford,"Recieved Thule 445 roof rack imediately after the order was placed . When recieved the box appeared damaged and once opened I found parts missing. I reported the problem imediately to Niagara Cycle Works who was through Amazon where I purchased the product from. They imediately had Thule drop ship the parts to me and even included some spare parts - where can you receive service like that! I will definately buy from Amazon , Niagara Cycle Works and Thule again. Most important, this roof rack fit like a glove and with the Thule Goal Post Rack at the rear of the truck , the 2 racks hold my kayak securely in place ."
1,Poor sound quality,"This item did not work very well with my LG1300. The sound quality was very poor even after adjusting the volume controls for the handsfree device on my phone. I found a universal hands-free kit for 2.5mm jacks at the store where everything is a dollar and bought it, thinking that if it didn't work, well, at least I'm only out a buck. Amazingly, it worked MUCH better than this one! I am therefore returning this item for a refund and keeping my one dollar bargain in its place."
1,Poor quality,"Ever try to meditate to a cd whose audio increases and drops off for no reason? Can't be done. Also, the narrator has a limited vocabulary and as she reads her script, mispronounces some very common words. So instead of finding stillness, I found silliness.Toss this one in the trash."
5,You'll love this CD!,"I was given this CD by a friend, and have listened to it a lot. It has some great tunes on it, and I first heard of it while in europe, where it sold out! The songs vary in intensity, from pretty mellow, to down right rockin, and the lyrics will stay with you. It's definitely an intelligent CD, and some of the songs take a refreshingly alternative look at America. I recommend it highly, and I guarantee it is one you'll remember!"
4,VooDoo Lounge Book of the Month,"As the title states, the VooDoo Lounge at SAIC voted this the ""Book of the Month"". To be honest, I read as much as I could in one night before writing this review, but it interested me enough to want to buy the book and read more. The title and cover make it appear to be some sort of joke, but the parts I read were profiling the man who is arguably the formost meteorite-hunter in the world. I plan on studying it more to find out how to find one of these little buggers lying somewhere in the desert - like the guy who bought the book at our company did - which is currently being appraised at UCLA and estimated possibly at a 5 figure amount...but I digress, unless you want to spend your life playing Laser Tag, I recommend you buy this book and study it in detail. It is entertaining and possibly profitable."
5,Space rocks,"We are novices in meteorite hunting, and this book shares alot of information on this interest of ours. I feel it is a good reference, and educational tool for those wanting to learn more about meteorites and meteorite hunting. Now if one would just land in my yard! Enjoy"
2,Different from picture,"I was disappointed because these turned out to be much darker in color when I received them. When looking at the picture, they look more pastel, light shades, which is what my bathroom is done in. They are cute, but they don't match!"
3,pretty good,I have lots of back and sholder pain and this help sometimes. Over all it works pretty good. A little expensive once shipping was added. other then that pretty good.
3,satisfying but...,"This piece of software has some very interesting features such as the video desktop mode where you can watch your dvd as it plays in the background on your desktop thus allowing to keep on working while watching. Another great feature is the capture mode that allows you to ""photograph"" a video frame while listening to the movieBut one problem does come to mind, dispite having more than the minimum requirements for the player sound playback is uneven. The player frequently seems to be a fraction of a second behind or in advance when compared with the movie."
3,Ok but a bit disappointed,"I liked the program, is easy to use but you have to be HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET to receive and look at all the pictures. I have dial up internet and it takes alot of time to down load pictures. If I new that I would not have bought the product."
1,The Worst,"I tried unsuccessfully several times to install it.I contact their alleged support. They sent me what they deemed a ""fix"". The fix was awful. It caused my computer to crash and Print Shop would never work.Broderbund used to be a good company but I've had nothing but problems with their software of late.They need to rethink their products, their support, and their company focus.They are lousy at this point.They obviously don't give a dang about quality, support, or their customers."
1,LOOK OUT,I have been disappointed with this new verision because it locks up the computer causing a Quick Project to take way to much time---Look into buying a different brand-Broderbund what happened?
1,Print shop 22 will not completely load.,"This is the first Print shop that I've owned, everything goes ok loading until it gets to the product registration. Its stops and rolling back action takes place. The program is erased from the computer. I have other Broderbund programs that work correctly the first time. If any body has any tips to correct this problem, please let me know.Larry (San Antonio, Texas USA)"
2,NOT a web page designer,"I put a lot of work in designing a webpage using this poduct. When I did a preview, it turns out to be a complete disappointment. The alignment on every object when looking at the source file is ""absolute left"" leaving a huge white space on the right of my browser, even in a 800x600 screen size. Sure there are different browsers and resolutions out there, but somehow even Word's web publisher provides better results. If there isn't a patch released soon to allow a web page to be ""liquid"" in a browser then I'm wasting money and hard drive space with this. Note to Broderbund, don't add features if you don't know how to properly develop them."
1,Read details about product before buying.,I could not install this software on my computer becasuse it was not Vista compatible. This information is not readily available when reading specs about the software.
1,Incapatible with my minolta color laser printer,This program zapped my marvelous Broderbund Printshop Ensemble III AND used 9 times as much printer memory and probably 100 times slower than deluxe 20. They should be sued.
1,"Printshop Deluxe, version 22","This is a very disappointing product. I've had previous versions and they never gave me any problems. Version 22 does not let me add text in the textbox after double clicking. I've installed and re-installed the product a few times, but it's always the same. There is no online support and I kept getting the run-around. I will uninstall it for good this time and throw it in the garbage. Do not buy this product !!!"
4,reviewing print shop deluxe 22,I found this product easy to install in my computer and was able to put it to use within an hour. This was very helpful since I had a project I wanted to use this to do and it arrived in time for installation and use to be within my deadline.
4,SCRMC,"I work in the Education Department, and we love it, love it, love it.We use Print Shop to create all flyers for meetings, announcements, special projects, etc.We love the large variety of graphics and formats that are available for all occasions.I'm still discovering the many features it has to offer. It is software and user friendly."
4,loved it,Before I upgraded to the vista I really loved this product but sadly it is not usable with vista. It is user friendly and fun and makes great projects.
3,works online only,"The program and most graphics used actually work as a shell and Internet connection is required for the files to run.This should be quite clearly stated on the programs own advertising .If the company goes bust at any time then the program is of no use and all customers will have wasted the cash paid.It is quite clearly not advertised by, nor is it stipulated by broderbund as an Internet program only.It's a let down greatly on the company's own part, other than this the program is perfect and well worth purchasing."
2,Don't use it with Windows Vista,"This product does not load in Windows Vista without workarounds. In fact, Vista warns that it is incompatible! Try something else."
5,Wonderful,Would recommend for anyone with a graphics business. I print shirts and need graphics. This was great and easy to navigate.
1,PRINT SHOP 22 DELUXE,RETURNED. SOFTWARE NOT USEABLE WITH ALL THE OPERATING SYSTEMS (SPECIFICALLY ME) TOUTED ON THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION PAGE.
2,The Print Shop 22 Deluxe,"Not pleased with it at all, had expected more of them with this release. Have had earlier versions including 21 so should have known better."
1,Print Shop Deluxe 22,This program is not compatible with Windows Vista. It locks up or just stops working.
1,"No support, need on-line to use. But Wait! There's More!","What a waste of money. I have dial-up and was horrified to discover that you can't do squat unless you download the images. Then, to make things worse, it times out and fails to establish an internet connection, even when the computer is already connected.Tech support has a one-line response to every problem, no matter how different the problems are. The answer is: That's the program.Hello! That's no answer and that's no help.Broderbund used to be a great company. What the heck happened to it?Even with a refund ($40 off this $50 program), this isn't worth it.And as for ""wait,there's more ... ""I lied. Just like Broderbund."
3,What Happened?,"The squire and knight in the first two books is really what got me started in this series. Then Morris let go of them ( although they didn't dissapear completely) in the third book. Now this. It's pretty good, but the only reason I'm reading this series is to find out what happened to those two people. He didn't finish their story!"
4,good read,"I purchased both of Sara Gruen's horse themed books after reading ""Water for Elephants"", one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time. I enjoyed both of her horse books too, but not nearly as much. Good story, but a little too horsey for me :)"
4,Review,"Sara Gruen is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Her books are fun, engaging, and very entertaining to read."
5,I enjoyed it!!,"I do not know enough about horses to respond to reviewers who criticize the reality of some scenes. But, I read to be entertained and step outside real life."
5,When will the next one be available?,"I have read both the Annemarie Zimmer books on my Kindle and could hardly put them down. I think you need to be a horse enthusiast to really enjoy them, though."
2,Flying Changes,Routine story line . . . nothing out of the ordinary. Conflict line was without real challenge to the main character before she got her 'pot of gold' and everything worked out beautifully. Not very interesting.
4,Water for Elephant lover,"I read Riding Lessons and Flying Changes because I was interested in Sara Gruen's other books after reading Water for Elephants.As stated in my Riding Lessons review, I can't give these books 5 stars because I'm not a horse person and felt a slight disconnect with the storyline in that area, as well as when she was describing different horse and riding terms that I'm unfamiliar with.That aside, I loved the characters and got lost in their stories. I read Riding Lessons in less than two days and hungrily craved every chance I could sneak a chapter or two of Flying Changes during busy holiday traveling. The storylines take dips and turns you aren't expecting, all while keeping you right in the character's head and emotions. They're really great stories and like Water for Elephants, ones I'd revisit again in the future when I start to miss the characters, as I sometimes do after great novels."
4,Changes And Dealing With Them,"This is a sequel to Riding Lessons by Sara Gruen. Annamarie Zimmer continues to be a passionate neurotic determined to sabotage her own happiness by impulsive behavior. There are changes in her. She is riding again, although not competing. She's rekindled a relationship with her old flame, the one she should have married in the first place. And she's getting her due comeuppance from her daughter, who wants to ride competitively.Reading a book like this is like getting a visit from the nutty relative that no one can stand. There is a dreadful awfulness, for example, in the scene at the fancy restaurant where Annamarie storms out on her boyfriend and yet, if the reader can cultivate a certain detachment, it is mighty entertaining."
5,I loved this book,"I am a horse rider, and I had, had a riding accident myself. So this book really hit home with me. ( as did Riding lessons the first book of this series )The main character in this story, cames across as a funny..strong and caring middleaged rider..I felt that there was enough riding and horses in this to keep a rider happy. It also touches on a subject that is taboo in the horse world "" FEAR"" , I for one was very happy to see that story line develope.. ,, but also think that non-horsey people will enjoy the story line..as there is a lot of "" other "" drama in here to keep you turing the pages."
5,"Not Zane Grey, but touching","I met the author, Sara, at a book signing in Keene, NH. My attention was brought to the book by its cover. Loving horses I thought this might be of interest. When I started reading the book I said to my self....this is a women's book. But, I had payed my money and took my chances... and decided to stay with it. I am glad I did. It is a heart warming story of a divorced mother and a teenage daughter and a fiesty grandma. I became very engaged in the story and was pleased with the story line. While not a Zane Grey, Sara touched my heart. Nice work, Sara. Shelby"
5,Great book!,"I had picked up the first book, ""Riding Lessons"", in a used book bin. I loved it so much that I had to buy the sequel! If you loved the first book, you'll love this one - it's just as good! (I can easily see both of them being made into movies!)"
2,Even less realistic than the first one,"Sadly, the more deeply the author delves into the world of eventing, the less realistic the portrayal is. Take her daughter Eva's comment, ""Arabians can be sport horses."" No, Sara, they can't. Arabians posses many wonderful qualities, but saying that a 14-hand Arab could be a world-class eventer would get you laughed out of the barn.Other than that, though, I still have trouble caring about either Anne Marie or Eva, and I found the physical descriptions of the characters confusing - at times it seems Eva is described as shorter than her mother, then another time much taller and bigger. A small detail, of course - I don't mean to nitpick - but it those things kept throwing me off. However, Sara Gruen is obviously a very talented writer (look at Water for Elephants), but this story left me cold."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I was actually quite disappointed with this book. For openers, the author clearly has only the most superficial acquaintence with the horse world she is trying to portray. In addition, the heroine and her daughter are two of the most self-centered twits I have encountered in some time.Some of the scenes are well-written, so if you don't have much knowledge of horses and/or have a high tolerance for inaccuracy and contrived situations, you may very well enjoy the book.If you want to read horse oriented fiction by someone who really knows her subject, I suggest Rita Mae Brown's Jefferson Hunt series."
1,Flying changes,"Great read enjoyed more than I had anticipated has all the requirements for a great read ... family problems, love, death, and rebirth!!!!"
2,"If there are more in the series, I won't be reading them","I did not care for this book or the prequel. I felt like I was getting depressed, scattered and pathetic as I read the thoughts of the main character.As a horse loving adult, I will read any fiction I can find featuring horses that is aimed at adults but these two did not make my keep shelf!"
1,"Boring! Too Little Story, Too Much Filler","I liked Water For Elephants even though there were some technical problems with it, but Flying Changes is so boring I didn't make it past pg. 11 before I started skimming and by pg. 25 still hadn't found any connection with this book. I'll put it up for resale.Too much description of small things and every move the horse makes is kind of a hint that there isn't enough story to make this thing move. It seems Gruen is trying to show us how much about horses she knows. Well, I have horses and work with them every day so this book becomes redundant to my life. I'd like to read a book where something I know nothing about is happening."
4,"Good book, fast read","A sequel, this was an equally good book, a very fast and easy read. Good character development, well-written, entertaining, and very interesting immersion in the world of horses and equine performance events."
1,Flying Changes is a led zepplin,"After reading Water for Elephants, which I adored, I immediatly went to Amazon and ordered Sara Gruen's other 2 books; one of which being Flying Changes. I was disappointed from the get-go. It was less than sophmoric and drab. I forced myself to keep reading thinking ""It's gotta get better - look at how genious Elephants was."" That'll teach me to think. I gave up on it yesterday after getting about 3/4 of the way through it. I started ""Where's My Wand"" and am extremely pleased. I'm afraid to even open the other Sara Gruen book - it may just lie under my bed in and hide in shame."
2,Disappointing,"I suppose I should write something clever, but I pretty much agree with everything in Bruce Loveitt's review above. It seems like the book should be very interesting, but it just isn't. I too finished it just for the sake of finishing it, but my life wouldn't be any poorer if I'd just left it on the shelf."
5,Samurai Books,Japanese writers are very creative. Love this book. The stories are rather short. But the contents are good. I know that a movie was filed based on this book. I loved the movie too.
5,The absolute best!,"I could only wish this 3 part series was on DVD now. It was informative and inspiring. Because of the beauty and the history presented in these videos, I was able to visit many of the locations on my first trip to Britain. They are even more amazing in person. The background that this series gave me allowed me to have a better experience where I traveled and helped me look for the more special places and treasures. John Julius Norwich brought the houses to life. Don't miss this series!"
2,Not a bad beginners book but.....,...beware of bugs in the code. This is a good book for an intro to digital sound and sound file formats but the code (at least the stuff involving the windows multimedia API) is rather buggy. Hopefully the 2nd edition will be better.
4,Old But Good,"I bought this book mainly because it has some examples in C++ for various platforms including Mac. It's outdated and doesn't include anything for Mac OS X (or core audio obviously) but it does describe the principles very well, and the source code is pretty easy to grasp. I like the book, but I'm still looking for another that will show me some more modern examples using .Net in windows and core audio on Mac OS X."
1,Not of much use,"This book is a reasonable reference for audio file formats. I would not recommend it for much more than that. There's also a feel to the text that implies it was written to supliment the sample code rather than the code suplimenting the text.I much prefer the Sine Wave code from Charles Petzold's 5th edition of ""Programming Windows"" to the code found here. There is much more clarity in the Petzold code (a simple function that can be compiled in C or C++) than the Kientzle code (too much emphasis in doing everything with classes).I would not recommend this to someone wanting to learn how to do more than write a file player."
1,"Good on theory, lousy on practice","IMHO the only useful stuff in this book are the various file descriptions for different audio formats (which can, of course, be downloaded from various ftp sites all over the net). Other than that it's almost useless as both a reference and a tutorial, being a lot heavier on theory than practice. The code is really top-notch object oriented C++ which makes it EXTREMELY difficult to follow and learn from. Obviously the author had usability in mind instead of learnability, eventhough the usability of the source code is questionable: it's useless for C programmers and it skips all system specifics and uses existing API's to do the work. Nothing about DSP programming is even mentioned in the book. Still, some of the theory parts are pretty interesting which is why my rating is 2 instead of 1."
4,Good cross-platform intro to sound,"This is the only book that I've come across that covers any of the trivialities of cross-platform sound programming. Sure there are better books on the various platform APIs, but they don't cover the differences between playing sound on Windows vs Mac. Small things like signed and unsigned data and byte swapping for 16 bit data are covered here. You won't find these things in Petzold's book. I did find a few small problems in the example code, but if you actually read the book, they're easy to spot. If you're writing cross-platform sound code, this book will be very helpful."
4,Thick Picks,"The nutcracker is a good tool, but we mostly bought it for the picks. They are too thick at the working end to get into the cracks and to do the work necessary to dig the meat from our pecans, but we are getting good use from the tool overall."
1,"Better than a hammer, but not by much","First of all, the picks are absolutely useless. The tips are too fat to be used with any nut smaller than a coconut.The nutcracker itself works well for smaller nuts like almonds and hazel nuts. It's a real challenge to crack larger nuts like Brazil, Pecans, or Walnuts. When a larger nut is inserted, the angle of the teeth is too large to get any grip on the shell. More often than not the nut slips out of the cracker before any cracking is done.I'll be shopping around for another cracker."
5,Really Cool!,"This game is really, really cool! For starters, it's pretty easy to get used to. Secondly, it's fun. The game's nerve-racking tension gets higher and higher as your Trace Viewer (You'll have to buy that at the start of the game for virtual-money) bleeps and tells you that someone is 87% hacking you. Anyways, buy this game. It's fun and will keep you occupied for hours on end."
5,"Fun, interesting, and somewhat technical.","This game, while dated is still an excellent choice. For anyone that ever has wanted to be an ""elite hacker"" or just thought it was cool, you should try it. The game is very easy to learn, there is a short tutorial and then it starts you on the missions.The game shows you some things that are correct with hacking, but the game does take place in the future so there are fictional things as well. In order to progress you need to upgrade your utility programs as well as your computer system.Every time I would get caught hacking, it would make me want to go back and try again. Its simple and addictive. Definately a worthwhile purchase."
1,Poor Delivery,"Item ordered one month ago, never shipped. Two e-mails never answered. When we called we were told the item was never shipped, no reason. Told it would be shipped two day air. Three days later it is still not here. The piece may be beautiful but I can't tell since I still have not received it."
4,another great book on interracial relationships,"this novel is more about a woman's coming of age in world war two south, then just about interracial relationships. her love interest, elias doesnt even come into the story until much later. but the effect he has on her is dramatic, making her realize that love is more than skin deep. the language mr. french uses is beautiful and does justice to the time and place the story is set in..."
5,This is a GREAT camera!,"I bought this camera a few weeks ago and I think it is one of the BEST purchases I have ever made! It is a great price for all you get and it takes GREAT pictures. It is very easy to learn how to opperate. It takes little movies, which are great. I have plugged it into the tv(with the connectors that COME WITH IT) to show friends and family pictures on the tv. My fil just went on a hunting trip to Canada and took it with him and he took GREAT pictures and he has NO clue about digital anything! LOL! It is SO nice to take pictures and see them and either keep them or get rid of them and develop only the ones you want. If you want a great camera for a great price this is it!! GREAT BUY!"
4,Now it's perfect!,"Hi, I'm the same person who wrote the May 2, 2003 (""A Bumpy Road so far..."") review below. I decided that Camera #2 definitely had blurry pictures, no matter what settings I used. Perhaps a lens problem, I don't know. So, I exchanged the camera again, and Camera #3 is perfect! The pictures are incredibly sharp, even on my large computer monitor. The batteries last for a long time. Despite the minor difficulties I had with my purchase, I really do love my Canon A60!"
2,Two different A60 cameras...both had problems.,"2 different A60 cameras... 2 different problems. The first A60 camera I purchased didn't work right out of the box. The lens would zoom out but wouldn't zoom back. It appeared to be a problem with the toggle switch. I sent it back and received a new camera. I used the new camera 2 or 3 times and suddenly got the infamous Canon E18 error. The lens gets stuck in the out position and the error code ""E18"" appears in the display. It appears to be a common problem with Canon digitals... just do a Google search on ""Canon E18 error"". I was dissappointed.... twice!"
1,Poor Focus and picture quality,"Somehow, I could not get the camera to do a better job on accurate focusing on the subjects. It's auto-focusing always blurs out the subjects while capturing the surroundings. Also, it's user manual is not detailed enough to explain the manual settings of the camera."
3,High portability but low quality,"I agree that the camera comes at a very attractive price, but on closer inspection, I don't think it is really worth the money.Cons:- Looks cheap and feels cheap- LCD is not that clear compared to other dig. cameras under the same category- Poor LCD light contrast- Very limited features in general, especially in the manual modePros:- Rather light and small- CheapBuy this if you want a camera that is portable enough to take with you to social events and parties. But definitely not recommended for taking panoramic or travel pictures. Even if you're a beginner in photography, consider spending an extra $100 for a way better camera with more features and flexibilities. You will grow out of this camera in a matter of weeks! A60 is cheap and easy to use, but it doesn't allow your creativity and imagination to go very far."
2,Broke after 1 1/2 years,"Originally, I liked my A60 until it broke after 1.5 years. I called the customer service only to find out it would cost $200 to fix a camera that I paid $250 for new. They offered me a refurbished camera for $150. The first day I opened it I found two problems with it. They would not return the camera and now I am out more money for a bad product. I would not recommend this product or the A70, which was the replacement camera. The Canon quality was very disappointing and the service was even worse."
4,low resolution LCD,"The biggest problem I have with this otherwise perfect camera is its relatively low resolution LCD screen. It isn't bad in general, but problem comes when sometimes the camera's auto-focus doesn't work properly, which is the nature of being ""auto."" You take a picture, and it looks ok on the LCD. But when you come home and transfer the picture to your computer, you find out it's out of focus! If I had waited a bit longer, I would have opted for the A75, not for the 3M pixel sensor but for the higher resolution LCD. Another minor problem is the ""low battery"" indicator. Once it starts blinking, you can get only three or four more photos before the batteries actually die. Wish it can give more advance notice."
2,Poor customer service from Canon,"I purchased this camera in June 2003. It worked fine for about a month, then one day, no images showed on the LCD, nor were recorded on the CF card. Sent it to Canon for service, it took 6 weeks to get it back. Now, 2 weeks later, the same problem has resurfaced. A GREAT camera when it works, but the quality and service are VERY POOR. Canon now tells me to send it back, they will repair it again. Maybe I will have a working camera for the Christmas holidays, what do you think?"
2,Poor Picture Quality,"I got this camera after reading a lot of online reviews. But to my dismay, the picture quality was not upto the mark. Most pictures were giving a 'greenish' hue also, the skin tones and sharpness left a lot to be desired. I tried this in different lighting conditions and the only time it worked well (gave true colors) was when the subject was v.close and the lighting was bright. I also tried the higher resolution A70 and even the salesman in the store agreed that there was a 'greenish' hue with the camera. Other features are good and the camera is easy to use. But lack of true picture colors made me return this camera. I would not advice buying this camera."
2,JUNK!!!!,"Same exact thing happened to me as the reviewer Joe; got the E18 error and lens won't move after only 18 months! Canon, you should be ashamed; such JUNK!"
2,Canon PowerShot A60 2MP digital camera,"This camera was great for about two years. Then, various functions ceased to work, and the camera died altogether after 4 years of moderate use. Maybe this is all people expect or want anymore, but I expected better of Canon. I had hoped to be able to use this camera for many more years--am I unrealistic? I would like to believe that a quality camera made by a reputable business should last longer than 4 years."
2,"Okay, but not great","I bought my A60 to replace my A40 after it was stolen. I figured if I had to replace a camera that I absolutely loved, I'd go with the next model up. Now I wish I would have just gone with the same camera. Besides a smaller, lighter build and more interesting sounds when operating, there are NO differences between the two. The biggest difference I've noticed with my A60 is the interference/colored lines that are often on the LCD when I turn it on to take a picture. It's like trying to watch TV with a bad signal. My A40 may have been less glamorous, but at least it was reliable. I'm keeping the A60 for now because I'm grateful to have a digital camera at all, but as soon as I have the extra money I'm going online and buying another A40."
1,Dont buy it,"At first it seems great, but mine broke after four months. I am getting an error message that says, ""Memory Card Error."" I have tried a new memory card, but the problems is not with the card, it is with the camera.Even thought, it is relatively cheap, it is not a product that will last very long."
5,Carmera,I bought a canon power shot A60 from this seller and all I have to say is this company is the best company I have bought anything from I ordered the camera on 7 pm sunday night and I reseived it on Tuesday morning. That was really fast. I wish they would of sent it without needing signing for it. But I know its more secure. I just think there great ++++++++++++++++
2,Great Comeras Beware of Bad Customer service,"I bought the A70 which takes great Pictures the colors are vivid and it is easy to use. I purchased an underwater case for it which leaked and ruined my month old camera. Customer service was rude, blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested. The underwater case has a 7 DAY WARANTY and the camera is not covered for water damage. My father had a similar problem with his $1000 Nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. So beware of bad customer service. Canon's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the Better business Bureau"
2,Don't Drop It,"I found this camera to be top notch for the money....that is until I dropped it. Yes, it is my fault that I dropped it, and unfortunately, people do drop things. Now, I get the dreaded ""E18"" error. In essence, the lense will not retract, and the camera, not liking this, shuts off. This camera fell from my lap to a carpeted floor, a distance of two feet. I wonder what would have happened if I dropped it from eye level to a hard floor or cement.The truth is I loved the camera, but if you figure that at some point in the camera's lifetime that you might drop it, I would either look elsewhere or keep your fingers crossed."
3,I love this!!,"i bought this camera a few months ago and i love it!! it is great quality, takes great pictures and is very dependable. ive dropped the camera a bunch of times and it doesnt break.. and its supercute"
4,GOOD CAMERA,I received this camera as a gift for Christmas and I couldn't have asked for a better camera. This one is great. I wasn't to sure I was going to be able to use it because it looked a little too high-tech for me. After messing with it for a few hours I got the hang of it. It's also very helpful to read the booklet it comes with. It came with a 16mb memory card but that should be replaced becuase 16mb isn't too much storage Overall it's a great camera and i suggest it for beginners and people with experience.
5,Great Camera!,"I received this camera as a gift, and couldn't have picked a better one. I don't know much about cameras, but it is very easy to use and takes great pictures. My fiance is more technical with it and knows the different settings it has for the different pictures you can take, and it works really well. He's taken some great shots of people & things in the dark, lit up, or from a distance, using the different lighting and speed settings on the camera. Very user-friendly and easy to learn!"
2,Loved it for 18 months,It worked great for nearly a year. A loose connection was fixed under warranty. At 18 months it died with an E18 error. The lens will not move in or out when turned on and then it beep and displays 'E18' on the display. We were on vacation so I replaced it with an A95. It's the only camera available at Best Buys that still uses CF memory cards. Hopefully Canon has the E18 issue resolved.
1,E18 Error,"before buying the camera, i read a bunch of reviews about it, and there were tons of people complaining that after a few months, the camera stops working and gives you an error that says ""E18"", and basically when you try to turn the camera on or off, the lens motor makes some weird sound and the lens doesnt move and the screen just stays black and says ""E18"". I've had this camera for about 3-4 months and i've been very pleased with it and the quality of the pictures, but looks like I had to learn the hard way about the E18 error. Definitely not worth it if the camera will only work for a few months. Trust me, do not take your chances. Do a search for ""Canon camera E18"" and you will see that this is an issue with many canon cameras. I wish I had taken other people's advice, but oh well."
3,A60 problems with E 18 error,"I purchased the Canon A60 for my son to use while he travelled on a 6 month visit to America. All went really well with the camera and we were very pleased with the quality of the photos and the performance of the camera. That was until he arrived back in Australia. Two days later we got the E18 error message. The lens would not retract and the camera is inoperable. To make matters worse when I checked the warranty, Canon offer only a limited warranty that is only effective in the country of purchase. This limited warranty was not obvious to us on purchase. We now have to mail the camera back to the US to have it fixed. Not only are we left without our camera but we will also have the expense of the postage. This error is well documented on the internet and seems to be a common fault with this camera."
3,canon digital camera,actually what I want to know is if this camera has a battery charger so I don't have to deal with batteries. The batteries go out too quickly. Please advise.Elsie
4,Very good camera,"I am very happy with this camera being my first digital camera. It's easy to use and the aperture function is very good if you can't use the flash (just keep the camera very steady!). I have one recommendation, get the rechargeable batteries that canon recommends only! I purchased the monster rechargeable batteries and when the batteries have no more juice, it just shuts off with no warning. When I use regular batteries, there is a low battery indicator that comes on but not when I use the rechargeable batteries. I have yet to purchase the canon batteries but I would think that it would be compatible."
3,"1st digital camera - its ok , not great","Purchased camera in December, took pictures at my daughter's wedding, birthdays, trip to NY state, Niagra Falls and various outdoor scenes with waterfalls, scenic views, etc..Used most of the various camera modes. It takes excellant outdoor scenic/ panoramic views in bright and low light conditions. Indoor photo's so-so, red eye reduction does not appear to work, wedding pictures were a disappointment because of this.Viewfinder is not very accurate, pictures tend to have much larger field of view than what appears in viewfinder, especially at top of picture, causes difficulty composing picture.Zoom mechanism is not very smooth, somewhat jerky & diffciult to get just the right composition."
4,"Good size and pictures, but controls could be better","This camera replaced a Kodak DC280 that I left behind on a bus. Its a good size and fits easily into my hand. The A60 uses AA batteries that are easy to obtain (both alkaline and rechargable). The quality of the photographs is excellent, sharp and with no noticable distortion. The numerous features are fun to play with.However, the controls are a bit complicated. Perhaps that is because there are so many features, but it took me a while to find my way around and it still does not seem nearly as intuititive as the Kodak was. There is also a slight delay between when the shutter is pressed and when the picture is actually taken. Finally, the optical viewfinder is not accurate, the only way to make sure of the framing is to use the LCD. These are minor gripes. Overall I am very happy with this camera."
4,Plenty of functions for the price.,I've been having this camera for the last one month & i'm quite happy with the image quality. ONE MAJOR COMPLAIN --> I DID'NT FIND THE USB CABLE IN THE PACKAGE. I wrote to amazon and they gave me the contact details of canon. However since i was in a hurry to download the images i bought a CF reader. Apart from this the camera works fine.....no dreaded 'E18' error yet!.If u want to get the best out of this camera then i suggest u read the manual and explore all the various functions however I got the best pictures in the auto mode. The metalic frame makes the cam look sturdy. The huge battery compartment (4 AA) works as a perfect grip for the cam however the 'zooming' lever could have been better off on the rear side. The 'stitching' feature is also great if you are shooting a panaromic shot. All-in-All this is an ideal digital camera for any amateur photographer who is just getting into the finer points of digital Photography.
5,K&N Drop ins for my Mercedes E55 AMG,"After the install, took out the car for a ride. Def noticed a def w/throttle response when step on the gas pedal. Car seems to want to pull alot quicker and reach the rpms alot sooner than before. Cheapest price for hp gains!!!"
4,Good product,"I've used this product for several years, and it is using a good material for my C240; you need to know your car too!"
3,Surprisingly doesn't fit,"Yes the throttle response is better and yes the fuel consumption is better but, considering the box says that this is ""drop-in"" and requires no modifications, the front, outboard corners of the filter housings will not seat properly and the torx screw in that location will not screw all the way in. Have asked K&N Techinical Support to advise if the rubber ""gasket"" piece can be trimmed to allow the housing to seat properly; no answer as of yet."
1,Worst shipping,"I ordered this item on December 13, but it's not deilivered yet as of Jan 3. HORRIBLE SHIPPING!!!"
2,Beautiful basket but horrible shipping,"I ordered this item in late November, got a shipping notice on December 4th, and it took until December 22 for it to arrive to it's destination. Customer service blamed problems with FEDEX, FEDEX blamed the company. I would NOT order from this company. I got the runaround for 2 weeks and item arrived 1 week later than what it was promised."
5,coffee???,"I bought this for my coffee drinking mom. It is a GREAT gift. She drank all the tastey coffee and I had a few bites of the cookies and snacks they were absolutely delicious, she felt so special and I felt good about getting it at that price. I will do again for my coffee drinkers. It was worth the price and now she has two starbucks coffee cups to remember the wonderful package I got her, do get it."
5,Best Christian book for both Parents and Teenagers.,"This book speaks for itself. It is written in easy English, so that even your jr. high students can read it and understand the contents. It is a good bridge between the parent and the child. I would recommend both the parent and child read it, and then sit down and discuss it. Sonnenberg does an excellent job in refering to the bible to support his points. He covers everything from the anatomy, to issues on homosexuality, infertile couples, masterbation, and great sex with your spouce. Sonnenberg is very much a Christian, and it shows through his book. Must read for everyone, and a much needed book in all church libraries. This is also recommended for the non-church sector."
4,Parent Manual on Sex terms: A prep for sex education of children.,"This is a Parents Manual on Human Sexuality. For Jewish, Christian, & Muslim parents, members of religions that espouse monogomus marriage,a book to be read in preparation for sex education of their children."
1,Hate it,This book will not help to read Hebrew at all. Very poor teaching tool. I would never buy from this author again.
4,TEACH YOURSELF TO READ HEBREW,"My wife and I decided to take the tour of learning Hebrew using this book. We liked it! If you stick to the guidelines and keep practicing you will learn. The teaching layout is clear, the model letters are in good size and in boldface so it helps your imagination when you try to write them down and memorize them. I recommend this book. It's a small book but with good teaching."
1,REALLY basic,This book really does little more than teach the aleph-bet. It uses the hebrew alphabet to spell out english words--not much point in that really.
3,Exactly what the title says,This really only teaches how to read Hebrew. The problem is you have no idea what you are saying.
3,Disappointed,I was a bit disappoint after reading. It teaches out of order which was a bit confusing and went a bit fast. I learned more online than book. But I keep it for a review and reference.
5,I Love This Book,I Love This Book I learned How to read a majority of Hebrew and all the letters and speak it I learned in under a day i'm still not finished yet but i managed to make it to lesson 6 in 1 day and it took me maybe a few days to finish I think this book Is great if someone wants to learn Hebrew i'm 14 and i caught on to it really quick. I'd Recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn hebrew and to me its a very easy language but some parts may be a little challenging but if you really put your mind to it you'll really like it.
3,Teach Yourself to Read Hebrew,Very Hard!! Too many different inflections for the vowels and can't tell which is which.
4,Just the Basics,"For the goyim, this is a great place to jump into the world of written Hebrew. It will teach you how to recognize and read Hebrew words easily, within a matter of days. I have had this book for over two years now, and though it is only a basic primer and workbook I still use it often for reference. It even includes an excerpt from a Hebrew prayer book, making the jump from a mechanical understanding of the words to a personal understand of the language a bit more palatable.While it has practical uses, it does not give the calligraphy strokes for writing in proper (or ancient) Hebrew. It also fails to go beyond letters and vowels, into definitions, proper sentence structure or composition. As I said, this is just a basic primer. Still, for the price it's wonderful."
3,"Some good photos, interesting reading material","It's been a while since I've read it but the preceding reviews seem to tell it like I remember the book being. You read some reporters reminiscing about Diana, especially towards the last, and you see some good photos."
1,Meh.....,"Yes, this book portrays women as seeming to only be worthwhile when they are serving a man in bed OR having his children...Alix is wanted romantically by BOTH her cousin AND her half brother and NO ONE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS!!!Ewwww - gross..... There has to better fantasy with strong female characters...."
2,Absurd amount of repetition,"I barely made it through the first book before giving up on this series. Around 60% of the story seems to consist of the exact same circular conversations and arguments over and over and over and over... There are many other problems, the grating nature of almost all of the characters, the lack of world building (which was sad because the Cheysuli had the potential to be quite interesting), but it's the repetition that really got to me. Conversations that had to happen once, maybe twice just kept resurfacing, which finally made me realize, this apparently ""strong-willed"" heroin never actually does anything, never takes action to change her situation other than to whine about it again and again. This apparently fascinating culture is never actually explained except when the characters mumble sagely (and vaguely) about ""the prophesy"", which they do again and again so that the culture never acquires any depth."
3,Enjoyable fantasy,"Jennifer Roberson's Cheysuli series is a fun read. Obviously a lot of thought and care has been put into the characters, and the developement of the vaious races. Roberson has taken pains to create a complete universe, and I thouroughly enjoyed exploring it.It's not *great* literature, and the later books I think show how Roberson has grown as a writer. The series has some flaws, as does much of the genre in general. However, this was the first and only fantasy series that I read all the way through without growing bored, which is a testament to the author's abilities."
3,Alright,"Okay, this was a good book. The only thing I had trouble with was Alix. Very annoyin! Her constants whining about how she feels and her actions without considering the consequences of them! Otherwise, it was a good book."
1,Overpriced product.,It wasn't a good buy at all! I should have purchased from other sellers. Their prices are much better. I don't think I'll shop again with this company.
4,Good Inexpensive Software,"For a pretty good price you can have one of the best label software products on the market. I've tried several and were never really satisfied. Surething allows you too save groups of CDs as one file so, for example, if I recorded a series of high school football games, I can save each football game as a separate label and save the whole thing as one file. When I want to print out just one, I can specify which one and what label on the sheet I want to use for the print.There are lots of backgrounds that come with the software and lots of options for creating text. You can create text that circles around the CD or a simple text box with various fonts and sizes. Importing is easy so you can use your own graphics.The thing I like most about this label software is that you can take any picture and center it, resize it, etc. so that it fits on the CD exactly how you want it. I started using this software at version 2 and it has improved without losing the feel of the original."
5,Our Pooches Go Wild for Salmon,"We've given our girls a number of fish based treats and kibble with great success. Evie the Bichon has assorted food allergies, but has never had any problems with fish. We like the texture of the treats, easy to break into even smaller pieces.We like the wholesome ingredients and lack of junk filler.The foil-lined pouch is sturdy and keeps the snacks fresh, though in our case the supply doesn't last long.We like that the treats are a product of the USA, not a factory on the other side of the world.Being a Spudman, I especially like the potato content.In short, our dogs like these fishy treats and react to them with much enthusiasm and anticipation."
2,Cheaply Made Faceplate,"This product is no where near the quality of the original Sony faceplate. It feels very flimsy and was a little difficult to fit onto the system. After installing the faceplate, I cleaned the screen with the microfiber cloth that came with the PSP. The cheap plastic couldn't even handle this and was soon covered in scratches. It ended up looking worse than the faceplate I was trying to replace."
1,NO GOOD,"I order my first one and it did not work, I return it and recieved a replacement one, and again it did not work. Amazon was good as far as both returns, but I don't think I will ever get anything that is solar from here."
2,Mixed feelings -,"I use this headset when I need my hands free. Most of the time it works well but at others, I cannot be heard on the other end. So when it works, it works well and I love using it. When it doesn't, there is no explanation and no fix.If I had to use it everyday, I would have to get a more dependable one and one with a volume control. But it does work for the most part, doesn't take up much space, and is cost effective."
3,Disney make-up,I bought this for a little girl who is a friend of mine. She LOVED the makeup. It is to messy however for her age (4 at the time). NEEDS ADULT SUPERVISION. Glitter is very very messy. Product arrived timely and in PERFECT condition. I would buy again from this seller.
5,CBTW,"This book was very difficult to put down. I read it overnigth and I also read the special edition of this book. Russel is the real deal. I have a lot of respect for his work and his integrity. I recommend this book for everyone who wants a insight in the life of a psyquic.It is an honest, deep and touching view of his own life. Defenitely a good read"
1,They don't even know the rules of chess,"First, their draw by three fold repetion is off.second, their expert level probably isn`t even rated 1000This is the worst excuse for a game I have ever seen."
5,Table Games is fun,"This set of games is addictive, especially if you are competitive and you enjoy playing pool. The games are cool to play and the talk back feature is great, I think. You can throw a pie in one of the characters faces. lol. The maximum pool has several versions of pool, like cutthroat or snooker, which I haven't seen in many games. Plus, if you think your good at chess, this will make you really think before you move."
3,Many bulbs were smaller than advertised,The bulbs/corms arrived on time but were disappointing. There were not exactly the amount advertised per bag and many in each bag were smaller than advertised.None have grown yet and I planted them several months ago.I'll take a wait-n-see attitude for now.
2,"yawn,yawn,snore",nothing to talk about.games great for a short time.by the organic level i thought i would vomit from the background.weapons and bosses okay.graphics sad.somethings missing.buy ADVANCE WARS instead.
3,An updated release of a classic arcade game,"I have always loved the Gradius series, its always been a simple side view spaceship shooting game, with a fire button and a power button. You are a small spaceship, which must fly through enemy platoons and fortresses destroying big bad monsters, turrets, ships, flame dragons and much more. Its simple, its ""classic arcade"" fun, but this Gradius has added a huge amount of detail, such as great backgrounds, enemies with more animations and more traps like volcanoes and moving gates. This however slowed down the game drastically! Playing this game is very difficult because everything moves so slowly and some of the time the directional pad does not respond! It gets very frustrating compared to the old Gradius games for SNES and NES, which had super smooth gameplay!"
4,Great game--screen is a little dark,I have been a fan of Gradius since Super Nintendo days so I had to order the Game Boy version. The game translates nicely to Game Boy. My only problem is the darkness of the screen. Probably a work light will take care of that.
2,An insult to Gradius,"The older Gradius games were great back in the day, but this GBA version bothered me so much I had to return it. The graphics are below average for GBA standards, but what really frustrated me was the gameplay.Gradius gives lots of cool and customizable options, but your ship's starting speed is so slow you can't even avoid being hit by enemies with 2-3 seconds to react! Once you can get a speed power up things balance out, but seriously the game is complete frustration trying to dodge slow moving enemies with a sluggish ship and still not being able to do so.Avoid this game unless you are a Gradius freak and need to re-live the old days."
4,good value,Will reccomend this product for work and fun. Ive been using it during CPTraining and outdoor activities as skiing.
4,A Gripping Expose',"""Presumed Guilty"" is a compelling, skillfully written first-hand account of the tragedy and drama surrounding the apprehension of Rodney King. The author, Stacey Koon, does an excellent job of depicting police life and he tells the story in a true, real way. His style is detailed and persuasive as he takes you from the fast-paced arrest to back-stories of his police career, and finally to the trial and the brilliant strategy created by the defense.This is unquestionably a fascinating story. While this is an easy plot to follow, I do recommend getting some background information before reading this account, because you will better understand Koon's writing."
2,Play the game before you review it.,"This game is complete garbage, the developers fixed up the background graphics but left the forground graphics in 16 bit.All the characters look like they got caught in a pixel explosion. The gameplay itself is verry slow as apposed to the fast paced Guilty Gear X. I think this game was developed verry poorly and I hope the next installment will be done right. Get Guilty Gear X, its the absolute best 2D fighter out and the price is only 40.00, you cant go wrong."
1,If you dont know what this is - DONT BUY IT!,"Reason? Its rubbish. I appreciate that old games should be kept alive in some shape or form, but keep them on the old machines unless you're going to do something about it to justify buying this games powerhouse.Hate to say it, but you're your own worst enemies if games like this make the Xbox successful. Avoid like the plague."
5,My favorite fighting game of all time!,"A huge selection of characters for endless gaming... This isn't a game you play over a weekend and never touch again. If you like fighting games, this is a must have.If you're interested in buying this I highly recommend having a arcade already with this game or a friend/people to play with or it can get pretty dull. I also recommend playing with an acade stick opposed to a controller."
4,"The news on ""Capcom vs. SNK 2""","Good news:-Interesting gameplay-More charactersBad news:-Still doesn't make as much sense as Marvel vs. Capcom 1 or 2-They(the characters) also don't fight as fast nor as powerful as the ones on Marvel vs. Capcom 1 or 2(Maybe some)Weird news:-Will they actually bring the entire Capcom and SNK families to the show?-Can they make the moves more interesting and organized just like in Marvel vs Capcom?(For example, Ryu's Shinku Hadouken and Ken's Shinryuken are a whole lot better in Marvel vs. Capcom 1 and 2 than they are here)Final news:I think that this is a really cool game as a whole. But they could make some sense out of it. If they added Strider, Hayato, Hanzo, Andy or anyone else but no more Street Fighters and King of Fighters and the switching, assisting, team up attacks, and the really insane super moves, this would be a perfect game."
4,More Complicated than MvsC2,"This is a game for people who like to incorporate strategy into their fights. If you have Xbox live do not buy this on PS2, get it on Xbox so you can play it online. I personaly prefer Guilty Gear X2 over this anyday."
3,An okay game,"I hadn't played any Street Fighter games in years so I couldn't quite understand or figure out the grooves. The graphics were fine but I prefer 3D animated characters over the 2D characters. I'm sure if you've been a fan of Street Fighter over the years, you'd enjoy this game."
2,WARNING Dont be fooled read this first,"Unlike the rest of the reviewers I actually have this game and I know how it really is. First off I like 2D fighters alot, but something has gone terribly wrong with this one. Before you buy this I strongly warn you that the graphics are terrible, I'm talking Super Nintendo quality if not worse. The backgrounds are extremely well rendered and look perfect like you would expect for Playstation 2. But here is the catch the actual characters are about 16 bit and appear verry pixelated. Look on the net for some screenshots and you will see what I mean. I give the game 2 stars because the gameplay itself is pretty good but not great. I honestly don't know how this problem got past the Beta testers. If you were looking forward to this game be prepared to be dissapointed. There is one solution if you don't already have it get the game Guilty Gear X its the best 2D fighter out now, (...)"
1,this thing don t work,wen i get the game i open the box to play but i wass fullllll of scashhhhes is all bad i tried to contact you gus but not answer i spend money on one game and it comes all relly baddddddddd i want another game or tell me how u cn help with that and next time make sure u r sellin something god!!!!
2,Its ok,"This game is ok. It has lots of characters and cn be fun. But 2d fighters arent acceptable anymore. its almost 2003!! Tekken 4 is 3 d, if this game was 3d it would be almost as good as tekken. The last 2d fighter game i liked was ultimate mortal kombat 3 in 1997."
5,Best of both worlds,"What do you get when you combine Street Fighter (with a little from Darkstalkers) and King of the Fighters (with a few from Samurai Showdown). What you get is one of the classics in the realm of 2D fighting games.The idea behind this game is simple. A tournament is being held to determine 2 things,1) the Best Fighter out there2) The best team out there.Along the way (if you are good enough) one of the bosses from either series will pop up (usually Bison or Geese), however if you are really good (1st place) you get to face off against one of the hidden bosses (the end result of the Akuma vs Rudal battle).Over all this is a simple 2D fighting game that is loads of fun and well worth owning. It's focused on combat but doing a non stop barrage of fireballs never hurts either now does it."
2,not bad,the case had no cover and the disc looked ruffed up but it plays like nothing is wrong so i will give it a shot. after i fully play the game i will see if there are any more problems with disc.
3,"It's good, but I'd wait for Marvel vs Capcom...","I like the Capcom games because the controls are always good and it's easy for my younger siblings to play them. The other cool thing about fighting games in general is that the matches do not last long so you can accommodate a large number of players (i.e. kids).I prefer ""Marvel vs Capcom"" to ""Capcom vs SNK"" so if you can wait until that comes out, get that game instead. Otherwise, ""Capcom vs SNK"" makes for a good party/holiday gathering game."
5,<<< FIRE + ICE >>>,"This is Skaldic excellence renewed by Ian Read and all. The Fire and Ice of *The Runes* [Futhark] is evoked via *various angles* -- pure and sharp ones in a *flowing wind* -- in sections that present various themes. These pieces add up into a greater whole -- like a moderately complex Ice Chrystaline SNOWFLAKE -- that is a unique bland of Chaos and Order / Fire and Ice / Kenaz and Isa / Creative Condensation. Even musically, great usage is made of musical SPACE -- the Gaps between the notes and a spacious flow of the old and new instruments -- from Nordic pipe and harp to modern organ and guitar. The fair and dark or mellow and stormy feel of the drums and acoustics is most fitting for the Spirit of the Runes [Wodenaz, Wilhaz, Wihaz]. Great to *meditate* on *the Runes of the Runes*. Complete via the last sectional theme *Seithkona* -- to inspire *utiseta* [even indoors] +++"
3,it was alright,"While this book does have some good information, and lots of photos to demonstrate techniques, the author doesn't even actually seem to demonstrate that he realizes any difference between muay thai and kick boxing. All in all, i would rather not have bought this book, but am not terribly upset that i did. So, not a terrible buy, but don't expect too much."
4,"Useful, eventually.","My first encounter with this text was as an undergrad, and I, like a couple of other reviewers found it baffling, and I held it with disdain. Later, as a graduate student, I actually dropped a course because when I purchased my texts, this was one of them. Now, fifteen years later, with higher education degrees and ten years of teaching experience under my belt, I actually find the essays interesting because I can relate to several of the points. They are very deep theoretically, and often philosophical, and I certainly would not recommend this to anyone for a bit of light reading. However, I must finally admit that, for the proper audience, this text is quite useful and even enjoyable in the sense that it presents and discusses complex aspects and quandaries of not only literature, but life. Fifteen years ago, even the essays I could almost comprehend left me asking ""who cares?"" but now I look at them and say ""how interesting!"""
1,Portentous Professors Unite!,"If you are looking for an easy introduction to literary criticism, than look no further!!.... for a different book. This book is a collection of essays that are poorly written and constructed, have almost no point or conclusion and for the most part leave the reader thinking, ""whaaa?"".In almost ever essay they use very large ambiguous words and quote many authors but actually don't define the term they're given. They end up using poor examples to express a word they forgot to define in the trample of nonsense. All in all the title of the book should be Irony because it's written by english professors."
1,this book is the devil!,"this book is the devil! i am using it in a lit studies course and loathe every second i waste reading these essays. they seem to be written mostly by stuffy university professors who are attempting to sound like they know what they are talking about. It is not a dictionary, nor does it help the reader properly understand a term. If you are curious about a word that is discussed in the book, i suggest looking it up in the dictionary. it's easier. and you'll actually learn what the word means without having to search through thick sentences that really make no sense and large words that you know the author just pulled out of a thesauraus."
2,Excellent Writing Marred By Loathsome Characters,"The trilogy the title refers to, revolves around Patrick Melrose at three points in his life. The first is at five when he's raped by his sadistic father. The second is in his late twenties as a a drug addict who has come to claim his father's ashes. The final section is a glimpse at Patrick as a recovered addict, navigating life while trying to put the demon of his father to rest. The technical writing is great. Beautiful witty prose, descriptive and vivid characters and smart witty dialogue. Yet I found it increasingly difficult to hang in there when I detested nearly everyone in the pages of this book. Sneering snobs, and drug addicts. Not my idea of an enjoyable read."
3,Not so pleased...,"It was a cool toy that never really worked very well. It has a sputter to its drive, when it works. Most of the time it doesn't work. Very annoying considering it cost 35 bucks... 35 bills wasted. I tried some other cheaper brands and those worked perfectly. I hope my inconvienience was just a fluke! Obviously from my experience with the other brands, this type of toy is a blast... if it works."
2,a big let down,"after reading her first two novels I though this one would be just as good, however, i found myself forcing to finish it and completely dissapointed. I did not feel the sense of terror or suspense that I felt with moofall or haunted. I hope she goes back to her previous format of writing."
2,book,was not interesting poor rating reader was led to believe something different went reading the cover review; long and boring
5,Perfect mix of scares and humor,"I love Tamara Thorne's work and Eternity meets my expectations. Her story-telling will draw you in, the tale itself keep you, and the ending make you seek more of her work.I'd love for SyFy to pick this book up as the basis for a series."
5,Heavenly CD,"Such a wonderful expression of ones Love for Jesus Christ. Eddie James sums it all up in such a beautiful way, not only God & his followers will enjoy, but many others looking to find the light, will apreciate as well."
5,Automotive quick disconnects,"Comparing various versions available, this brand seemed to have the quality at the lowest price. They work fine, kit keeps them together and the price was very reasonable. You need these to remove fuel lines on modern fuel-injected engines."
5,As described and On Time,"All parts are pretty good, everything was as described and pretty good package, nothing more to say, good service."
2,Keep On Going,"I have to admit that I was slight disapointed with this book. I was expecting great things as a novis rose gardener. I was expecing a more informative, colorful book. The material seemed to lack something. I didn't get very much out of the book and the mostly black and white pictures / drawings didn't help me much visually either. If you're wondering if you should purchase this book, keep going and find something better. I recommend the Miracle Grow book on roses - it is full of color photographs and more useful information."
3,It's OK...,"Very informative on a broad range of all things roses, but mainly on the surface-level; a good book for dummies, but not beyond.The color picture section was over-saturated, obviously not life-like colors.A good beginning and a quick read, but now I need to find a new book to continue learning about roses."
4,"OK, But Other Books Are Better","I bought this book along with ""Miracle-Gro Complete Guide To Roses."" I thought this book was OK, but the Miracle-Gro book was much better. The other book is in full color with picures of all the roses next to the descriptions. This book is mostly black and white with a short color section showing a few roses but not nearly all. There are other differences. Please read my review of the Miracle-Gro book if you're interested."
4,"Simple to understand, full of information",This book is for the beginning rose gardener. It is stocked full of information and guides you through every step from what you need to know before purchsing your roses to care after the roses are planted. I would recommend this book if you are thinking about growing any kind of rose.
3,The Novice Rose Gardener,ROSES FOR DUMMIES is just that: a basic A-Z book for those that are new to growing roses. The middle pages are devoted to some colorful pictures of roses that the author and editors of the National Gardening Association want you to consider. Everything else is in black and white. There is enough information here to digest so don't be put off by the cover.In many cases the information contained in this book was provided by members of the American Rose Society so you can't go wrong. For those of you who have more experience and want colorful pictures and informative descriptions look for the AMERICAN ROSE SOCIETY ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ROSES by Charles and Brigid Quest-Ritson. If there is a rose that still exists you should find it here.
2,Incomplete and Disappointing,"I wanted a digital version of Claire Davies excellent book ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition"" . Since there isn't one, I ordered this. I should have read the index first. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I looked for ""serratus posterior superior"" - the muscle with my worst trigger points, and one of the most difficult to isolate - and found it missing! With such a glaring omission I can hardly trust the rest of the information in the book. Stick with the Davies book, and hope that a digital version is available soon."
4,Straight forward book. Easy to use. Good value for the money.,Straight forward book. Easy to use. Good value for the money. There are many books who describe trigger points. This book is very easy to use/It is not a book for theory - more for work.
5,Trigger Point Therapy,"I bought this book for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. He just graduated as a massage therapist, and he loved the book. I got him this one the Reflexology Atlas. He loved them both. They are great books."
5,Great Book for Trigger Point Relief!,"Trigger Point therapy is the miracle cure for many aches and pains!Trigger Point Therapy for Myofascial Pain: The Practice of Informed Touch by Donna Finando is an easy to use book which incorporates illustrations of different stretching exercises that REALLY works out the trigger point knot. I use this book in conjunction with The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition by Clair Davies, which is a better source for diagnosing the trigger point (both cause and location)."
3,Slimey yet satifying?,"Though I found this book a fun and fast read, it left me a bit unsatisfied. I greatly sympathized and could relate to his stories, however, I felt that he didn't leave any great insights on how his past experiences will shape what he will do in the future. A lot of the book is common sense but it helps to read about it from another's point of view."
3,Is your life easy?,"I knew the author, having somewhat grown up with him. I found similarities in his life, and my own. I think that his storytelling is fascinating, and I wished for more, but I guess book editors can have their way with first time authors. I think that until you have experienced this kind of life, you will never know or have much understanding of it. How ironic it is that a college graduate would have to endure these kind of day to day hardships, that many would think would only be for the ""uneducated"". Yes, it doesn't leave you inspired. How often are we told that a book must have a happy ending to it. I think for those who have never known hardship, it is required reading."
3,Great for travel in Europe,"For anyone who has never traveled in Europe, washcloths are rarely offered or found in lodging or hotels. We bought the Rick Steves Clean Kit specifically for travel in Europe, but is also great for gym or camping. They dry very quickly.The wash is very gentle and works on body and clothing that is washable. I used this a lot on our Egypt cruise for things that needed a light wash and no pressing, like bathing suits, cover-ups, and evening gowns.I gave the product only 3 stars, as I have yet to find a refill for the wash, and the cloths are pretty small. They barely fit over my small hands, and my husband has a difficult time holding on to them. Additionally, there is a chemical smell in ours that we cannot get rid of, even after machine washing."
4,"Old book, but great organization and explanations","Even today this book is a good intro grad-level text. It covers reactions based on oxidation or reduction, and covers stereochemistry of nucleophilic additions, etc."
1,So disappointed I can't play this,"I was so excited to get my Intellivision Lives. But sadly I didn't read the reviews ahead of time. It just won't work under the newer Mac OS X software. Without Classic Environment, you are just plain out of luck. This is sad because their website said compatible with Mac OSX, but apparently it hasn't been updated since 2002 or so. I did see an interview online with the CEO who claimed they were working on an iPhone emulation for all these games, but until then, I have a useless CD."
3,Warning: DOES NOT work with Intel Macs,"I've used this program on my G4/G5 Macs and it works okay if you have the old Classic System9 emulation installed. Which is a pain, but would work okay.This emulation is NOT supported on Intel Macs. Do not buy this if you plan to use an Intel Mac, it will not work until they upgrade to something beyond System 9."
4,"Bring Out Your Dead... or rather, your undead","Okay, I really loved this book this has such great information. it offers you tons of stuff that I bet (even if you love all things undead) that you've never heard of before... or at least never gotten a proper explanation of before now. The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because I had previously read ""Vampires: A Field Guide To The Creatures That Stalk The Night"" by the same author and illustrator and that book is just outstanding, I mean, truly amazing - so by comparison (to how they are written, drawn, information compiled, etc) I had to drop this one a star because it wasn't quite as good as the vampire one. But nevertheless, this is a most excellent book and I highly recommend it."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this book online thinking it was going to be like a mock version of something a Giles character from Buffy or Sam and Dean from Supernatural would have. Something that described a particular demon or creature, its motives, its strengths, its weaknesses, special details about the creatures etc. Something I could skim for inspiration. That is the idea I got from the tagline ""A field guide to the creatures that cannot rest in peace.""Instead of a ""field guide"" I got a history book. Detailing some old wives tales and ghost stories. It was a somewhat interesting read but I never actually finished it after losing interest after awhile. I gave it 2 stars because of the deceptive title. Without that I would rate it at about a 3.I can see some people finding a use for this book but its nothing you couldn't find on wikipedia for free in a span of 15 minutes."
1,doesn't work after one day,"My son's car adaptor broke. After failing to find a replacement in game stores, we turned to Amazon. They delivered! But after one day of good use, the new adaptor doesn't work anymore. We've tried more than one car, but the little green light doesn't even come on."
3,Car adapter AOK,This was not a game; this is a car adapter for the kids' Gamecube. It doesn't seem available in very many places so I was glad an Amazon vender had it. It works fine and the kids love being able to play the Gamecube in the car on long trips.
1,"Great Concert, Poor Quality DVD","I saw this concert on HDNet a short while back (and it has been shown on PBS as a fundraiser.) I thought that it was one of the best concerts I'd ever seen! The concert had a great lineup and the dvd quality was fine. I bought the Outlaw Trail Collection so that I could own the dvd (since the single dvd was no longer available.) The dvd quality was the worst I'd ever seen! Grainy, colors were way off and pixelated (although the sound quality was decent.) I was very disappointed--the Amazon seller was nice enough to send a second copy of the dvd, which was better than the first but still worse than a bad VHS copy. Was the original dvd that was produced for sale this bad?"
1,The Outlaw Trail Collection,"Absolutely Poor Quality. CD,s were Miss labeled . Music on two cds were duplicated even though the label on cds were different.The concert dvd was the poorest quality I have ever purshased. most disappointed."
3,Concert was Outstanding,"Like another reviewer, one of the bonus music CD's was mislabeled and duplicated. Another complaint is that the concert had 25 songs, but the music CD of the concert on had 17 songs, missing some good music."
2,outlaw trail collection,"I thought thesongs were performed by the outlaws, instead it's done by alot of other artist.I'm looking for green grass & high water, I think thats the name of the song, I can find it in cd, but bot dvd, can you helpme find the correct dvd?"
5,Willa Cather's early works,"I adore the classics. It is rare if I am not currently reading a book by Tolstoy or Twain, Hugo or Voltaire, but somehow I missed Willa Cather. I recently read this entire 5-book collection and I was hooked on her writing style. She is good with the turn of a phrase, and is a skilled enough writer to take her readers into the story with her. Her writing seems so effortless. How is it that the real masters of any art form make it look so easy? Her skill is admirable and her characters unforgettable. I highly recommend her works."
5,Review,Most book from Amazon are excellent. I do not bother reading anything but the best authors. tHE kINDLE IS EVERY READER'S DREAM.
4,My Antonia,This book was very interesting had a good theme and plot.It kept the reader on edge throughout the entire book. I wouldrecommend it to everyone.
4,Roller Coaster Tycoon,Very Fun and Addicting! Great for any age. Customization is cool for building your uniquely designed roller coasters and other rides.
2,Extremely Bad Sound Quality,"What could have been a good album will forever lay at the wayside of bad acoustics, now I understand that this is their first album, but someone should have told them that clubs and bars are not meant for recording. Now I would also like to relate this is the only negaitive quote I have ever said about Flogging, and will hopefully be the last."
3,"Okay, so the romance is a little thin...","...But Christie Ridgeway manages to reveal candidly what it is like to live in a small town, where one's reputation maps one's life. Though few people have Kitty's exact problem, that of being the latest desendant of the town madame, and working every day in the restored cat house, Ridgeway does strike a cord with anyone who knows what it is like to be known for the deeds of one's ancestors or relatives, and not for one's self. All Kitty wants to do is be seen for who she is, and to be understood apart from her family's reputation. When she and Dylan spent a night together years ago, she reached for a glimmer of respectability. Now he is back, and steaming mad.The plot is very thin, and Dylan is practically a cookie cutter hero, but something in Kitty's situation grabs the reader and makes them like the book despite its obviously weak plot and carbon copy characters. Try this one. You might just like it."
3,Didn't finish it...,"It's a nice story, has lots of potential but it's so slow that I wasn't able to engage in the story...."
4,"Unique approach to balanced, natural hair care","Janssen's book takes a holistic, ayurvedic approach to healthy hair. There are tips about discovering your different doshas, and This includes addressing dietary issues, stress-response issues, and physical fitness. The author speaks about the anatomical structure of hair, the history of hair styling and hair composition.The author has meditations to use to reduce stress, mindful nutrition, yoga tips, etc; and recipes -- including creating your own shampoos, step by step henna applications, making ayurvedic oils, conditioners and gels.Really wonderful book."
3,Little disapointed,This book offers a lot of information about ancient hair styles and technical information about the construction of the hair shaft and even the chemical make-up of the hair. Which is all good information to know if you are writing a research paper for cosmotology school. But if you are just looking for simple recipies to improve the health of your hair you may want to try a differnt book.
3,very technical,"Not the book I was hoping for- if you want to learn the ""science"" of hair- this is the book, however, i wanted something simple, with easy to do receipies and tips. This book goes into a lot of detail, that might be better suited for someone in beautician school......"
3,Aqua Fitness,I would like to have had more detailed instructions for the exercises shown. Although you have pictures of the exercises I found that I needed to have more information on them.
2,Kindle version of Huffington is lacking,"I enjoy the online Huffington Post a lot, so I was happy to see it offered on Kindle. Unfortunately, the Kindle version bears little resemblance to the online version. Only short excerpts of most articles are available, with a link to the remainder of the article online. This defeats the purpose of the Kindle, which shouldn't need a constant internet connection and cannot render most web pages satisfactorily. Additionally, the current articles online are not available on Kindle at the same time, in spite of frequent updates. You'll want to check the web version anyway. On the plus side, it's cheap and the articles and news items are often interesting. Amazingly weak effort by Huffington Post."
3,"I don't mind the format, but what is with the adds???","I love the Huffington Post! So much so that I can deal with the Kindle format for this blog. However, what I don't understand is why I should pay $1.99 to have advertisements on my Kindle."
5,No problems here,"I signed up for the Huffington Post the other day and have had zero delivery problems. The blog updates throughout the day and is a pleasure to read on the Kindle. Of course, some of the interactive content is missing (videos and such) but otherwise it's a great way to experience Huffington. Of course, if you're like some of the other posters expecting balance, stay away. This is a liberal blog edited by the author of:Right Is Wrong: How the Lunatic Fringe Hijacked America, Shredded the Constitution, and Made Us All Less Safe"
4,"Dec. 31, 2007 problem",I had to cancel my subscription and then resubscribe to get the blog to update after the end of the year. Hopefully this was just a one time issue due to the year end. Otherwise I enjoy the content and the frequent updates.
2,not worth it,"I used to subscribe to this on my Kindle.But there are just too many unsubstantiated wingnuts here, anti-vaccination loonies etc.also the formatting is pretty bad on the Kindle.go read it for free on the web if you must."
2,Love the functionality but.........,"Love having the Huffington Post on this device and love having it update regularly, when it is working, however, currently, mine has not updated since 12/31/07 and the website has updated repeatedly since then. What is the story? Cannot find a support person who can help with this."
1,Look Elsewhere,"Update: 7.25.2008Based on subsequent reviews, I decided to give this another try. Glad I did! Good schedule of updates; informative content. It's a keeper! I'd give it 4 stars currently, but the system won't let me change the earlier rating.=== Prior Post ===Several months have passed since the most recent review; hence, this update. Today is June 4th, the day AFTER the history-making last day of the Democratic primaries. McCain, Clinton and Obama each gave speeches last night.As of 9:45 a.m. today, the Huffington Post is stuck at Monday, June 2nd.Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the Daily Kos. Updated frequently during the past 48 hours, including snippets of related international headlines!"
3,Should be free,As with all blog subscriptions. Anything that can be accessed with a smartphone without charge should not be charged monthly re- occurring.
2,I'm glad I tried it free before subscribing.,Today is July 5th. The issue hasn't been updated since June 28th despite all of my other blogs updating multiple times per week or even daily. Plus: Where are all of the articles?? There is nowhre near the content here for $2 per month that there is for free daily. Save your money. Use your Kindle browser and read HuffPo for free when you have a connection.
2,Initial impression is it's lacking on multiple fronts...,"From my initial impressions I'm concerned with two issues:The content doesn't seem to update as often as the website. Granted, some of the lack of updates were during the holidays but the website is contantly being updated. That brings me to the other point...Not all the content from the website is in the Kindle edition. It seems like they are selectively choosing articles to include in the Kindle download. I'd be nice to get everything..."
1,read full article at....,"They give the first few sentences and refer you to the web page. If I wanted to go to the web page I would not be paying to get it on my kindle now would I? I love Huffington Post and was really looking forward to this. I found it really lacking. No delivery issues, yes a few ads I found REALLY annoying. Not worth the money.. Reminds me of getting a text message to tell you that you have voice mail."
1,What's Happening Here?,"I subscribed as I have been an HP reader from it's inception. Very frustrating that it has not updated all week! What is the problem? A short note to inform subscribers would be appreciated. I will give it a few more days, then I will cancel and expect full refund!"
3,I've enjoyed having this blog up until 12/31/2007,But I agree with the other user that it hasn't updated this year. Constant updates is the purpose of subscribing to this blog. It would be nice to get more recent news.
2,Was Good But Is Slipping Away,"When I first began subscribing to the Huffington Post blog for Kindle, I loved it! For one thing, it was always delivered promptly in the early morning, ahead of Reuters even, and always filled with interesting articles. That was early in the year. Now, both delivery reliability and content seem to be suffering from lack of attention. I usually like Arianna's work but feel that she may have overextended and a suffering HuffPost for Kindle blog is the result. I may soon cancel!"
3,ok but I hope it improves,"Can't say this is too bad and it's nice to get the Huff Post on Kindle , but its not the internet version. I'm hoping they'll improve it as the tech gets better. This and the NY Times online is all the news you'll ever need."
2,No Updates,I signed up for the 14 day trial. It updated once (I think) and no new updates since. It is stuck on Tuesday of this week and now it's Saturday. Isn't this supposed to update several times a day?Any suggestions?Thanks.
1,Horrible!,This was absolutely nothing of what I expected. Very disappointing! I will avoid ebooks in the future due to the return policy.
4,book review,book has a lot of wonferful infowish i could have had this info 3-4 years agoprobably would have been more useful then
2,Not Enough Practical Information,Sounds great in theory but not enough practical information. I find Katharine Leslie much more helpful.
2,Not what I thought!,"This book is written for parents/guardians of kids/teens who have been through a traumatic experience, not for parents/guardians of difficult kids/teens, although that is how everything I read about the book before I purchased it led me to believe! I can't say much about the book itself because I have a difficult child, not a child who has experienced a traumatic event. Just wanted everyone else to know EXACTLY who the book was written for before they spent their money on it!"
1,Complet waste of money,"This book was terrible and it's scary to me that something like this is in print. The first clue was the bashing of ""traditional views"". When someone is so intent on bashing other opinions, usually they are not too secure in their own. After reading this trash, now I understand why. What is really disturbing is that the authors actually quote Scripture but their message is far from it. The bottom line in the book is everything the child does is not their fault or their responsibilty. It is something in the parent that makes the parent upset by the behavior. God help the families that actually by into this message. I'm very sorry that I spent $20 on this book - even $1 would have been too much."
5,"Beyond Consequences, Logic & Control","This book was about love! This book was about seeing children from a love-based perspective. It was about responding to children with love (which allows us to think clearly and rationally). It was about healing. It was about providing emotional safety for children with trauma histories. Heather T. Forbes & B. Bryan Post, the authors of this book, address some of the most crucial and demanding issues faced by parents of children with histories of disrupted attachments.This book taught me how to uncover my own fears, step into my child's inner world, and respond to their behaviors with love. By confronting my own fears, I am better able to help my child confront his or her or fears. The book emphasizes that we should parent children from a place of love and compassion rather than fear and control.Easy reading!I recommed this book to EVERYONE!"
4,A great resource for foster parents,"This book is a great resource for foster parents or any caregiver dealing with very difficult behaviors. The only problem is the text layout makes it a hard read and with no margins to write in, it is a hard text to make notes in for future reads."
3,For reference use only,We bought this book as we adopted an older child with a lot of psycholigical and behavior issues that were treated with medication only and not discipline. Some of the information is good but the system isn't always the best for every child.
1,"""Dr."" Post","Since I purchased and read this book, I have found out that Bryan Post's credentials are suspect. His PhD is from a college (Columbus University School of Public Administration) that is basically a diploma ""mill"" where anyone can get a ""PhD"" for a price. He has been reprimanded by the Oklahoma State Board of Licensing and forced to use a disclaimer in all his advertising. (All these facts can be found by searching online) In my opinion while Bryan Post has some very good ideas and is a dynamic public speaker however I cannot trust him based on these facts."
5,"Finally, something the REALLY works!!","I have trained, consulted, and provided family therapy for families all over the nation for 20 years. Families challenged by severe behaviors in their children, themsevles and in their entire family system.Finally, a book that I will purchase and offer to EVERY family with whom I work. Real life situations, real life examples, real life, realistic and love based approaches to our children who are often so frightened. And all based on recent research and findings in the field of neuroscience, physiology and psychology. A hit for every family-Thank you Dr. Post and Heather Forbes, thank you for paving the way for those of us too afraid to often start it ourselves!!Juli Alvarado, President, Coaching for Life, LLC-"
2,just not for me,Having an adult child with special needs i thought i would get some great information. To my surprise it was nothing i thought it would be. Very disappointed!!!
4,Life Changing,"Heather Forbes approaches kids in a whole new light. She takes the most current research on brain development, trauma and parenting and pulls it together in a way that makes such good sense! She is both a mom and a therpaist - so brings real life ""in the trenches"" experience to her work. This is not your ordinary parenting book - it is for parents of kids who have experienced loss, trauma or other difficulites in their lives. Let yourself be open to the information - and it will truly change your life and bring peace back into your home."
5,A Parenting Model with an explanation and a road map.,"I am a therapist and a school social worker for emotionally handicapped adolescents. As a therapist and social worker, I am involved with childen who live in their family of origin, foster children and adopted children. They have all experienced some type of trauma and come from places of much stress. The Stress Model works; it is more than an explanation, it is a method. Since steering my practice in the direction of helping children and parents attempt to overcome stress (read fear) and come from a place of love and empathy, children's behaviors are no longer overwhelming to me. I seldom consider the need for hospitalization to stabilize a child. The model as taught by Bryan Post and Heather Forbes is as clear as a road mpap that includes maneuvers to get you where you are going. It isn't technical jargon; it is real. Buy it! Read it! Re-read it! And don't lend your copy out; keep it near you. Elaine Spicer, LCSW"
4,"Whats there is good, but the subject is so broad that more would be better","100% worth buying.The book touches upon many ideas in budding systems.But it left me wanting more. The book is just a starting point. It wouldn't really help you much if you were designing a system.This book is of most value to someone who isn't familiar with several systems, philosophies, and lots of conventions.It brings you up to speed, but then you are left on your own to do the real work.It's an interesting book, but by itself wont be enough to design any worthwhile system."
3,Worked OK,"Extremely hard to get clean, so I don't think I will be able to use it again for a different project."
3,Nice little woolie for tight spaces,"Used to use this woolie quite allot, for tight spaces, between door jams and walls, it's small, so you need to keep track of it :-)"
1,Disappointed with the Reputable Brand,"I ordered this item on 3/25/09 and got it on 4/3/09. I live in New England so I have to wait until my pond thaw out completely and clean it before I can place the pump in the pond. The pump starts in mid May and now it's just mid July it stops pumping. I took it out of the water to find out the cause and I found that the impeller is no longer turns.I have no idea what cause the malfunction, I'll contact the manufacturer for a replacement, but I am not putting much hope for the replacement unit to work for much longer.Buyer beware!"
4,A Heartfelt and Sincere Tribute,"Oddly enough I've never considered Ronnie McDowell's voice to be all that similar to Elvis' - despite his numerous pinch hit appearances for the king on several TV movies. A rather soulful, modest and sincere crooner, who's voice resonates equally with the influences of country, gospel and soul. On this '97 tribute, Ronnie's debut on Intersound, several of Elvis' biggest hits are revisited (along with a gorgeous original ""Tupelos Too Far""), with the help of no less than several surviving members of Elvis' original band. The arrangements echo that of the originals, without ever sounding maudlin or derivative. There have been many cheesy Elvis tributes recorded over the years, but this is definitely not one of them. As an aspiring guitar player myself, I might also add that this CD also marks a most welcome return to form for one of my earliest heroes - Scotty Moore, still sounding fine after nearly five decades!"
3,"Great pictures, but a tired format","A tradition that every November we preview the coming ski season with the new Warren Miller film. I'm afraid this one disappoints. Some great footage, and a worldwide coverage, but there isn't much different from last year's film, or the one before. Creeping commercial content and an over hyped commentary. Too serious - where's the comic content that his films used to display to break up the epic actin shots?"
3,"pretty pics, nothing new","Warren Miller always delivers good skiing on beautiful terrain. That said, I was disappointed with the glorification of Jeremy Bloom and tired park tricks. It is entertaining, but it only inspires me to do a run or 2 off the chairlift before hitting the bar (most ski films make me want to slap the skins on my teles and hit the biggest peak I can find-now). Good film, buy it if its on sale."
5,Great Ski Movie,If you are looking to get in the mood for ski season - Warren Miller produces some of the best skiing footage I've seen. Another quality addition to the skier's library.
4,Nice Product,"I'm impressed with the quality of the product. For the price it was a good buy. The only issue I have with it is the zipper. The zipper has a fault. When the wallet is opened up, the zipper retracts into the wallet and is very hard to zip back up. I'm getting used to it but definitly poor design. Otherwise it's a pretty good product!"
3,cd holder,nice looking case on outside but when when u go to put the cd in the film is real thin and it rips easily when u are putting the cd in i wouldnt want to buy to many of these even at the price they offer it at
3,Okay product but paid too much on amazon...,"i guess designing a case to hold this many cds is like building a rocket, as it's hard to find one that works. but this one does...as good as it gets i guess. my only gripes are as follows: it's as ugly as a russian rocket and I just saw it for less money at the local wallmart."
5,good,i have spent too much time reviewing products i am done done done done done done done done done done
1,Only stores 280 cd's,"The holder has 33 pages that hold 8 cd's each, and slot for 16 more cd's in the front cover. That's enough space for 280 cd's total. Either the manufacturer or Amazon.com sent the wrong case or this is a bait and switch gimmick. I am very disappointed."
2,Not the best quality,"I was expecting a disc wallet with more quality. I am a little disappointed with my purchase to be honest. The item I bought seems very cheaply made and flimsy, like it could tear very easily. I suppose it will do its job, but overall I am not entirely happy with my purchase."
3,It's ok..,"I wanted a DVD case - I was under the impression that this had spots for cover sleeves, but it doesnt. It is just a gigantic CD holder. It feels a tad flimsy too. Not impressed."
4,Nicely Designed Case,"This case is designed with ease of use in mind. The new binder system that is used within this case makes turning pages very simple.The oval shaped rings are now plastic instead of cheap metal. This means that instead of warping with pressure, it bends and regains its shape.This wallet does lay flat on a service to allow for quick and easy access to all 100 discs.There is only enough page slots to hold 92 discs in the wallet, the other 8 that it holds go in the front of the wallet for ""now playing"" storage."
3,Anthony,"I like most everything about this product. No problem inserting CD/DVDs into the pockets. I like the fact that the binder holds the pages securely while allowing you the option to open the binder to move pages around. My complaint is that CaseLogic does not allow you to purchase additional pages for this product. While they sell ProSleeves for standard 3-ring binders, they do not offer the sleeves for this CD Wallet. I contacted customer service, and they could only apologize for the inconvenience. The rationale escapes me since they are willing to sell generic sleeves."
3,Effective but not Effiecient,"The case does store a large number of discs which I like, but it is very cumbersome to add pages to the middle of your selection if you organize them. I often have to take a large section of pages out of the case in order to get to the unused pages, the rethread them onto the binding. It can be time consuming."
2,Poorly designed sleeve lock,"The mechanism to lock the sleeves to the book does not work at all, it consistently pops open whenever the book is opened (yes, even when ""locked"").Perhaps there is a way to store this many CDs, but this product is not it.Look elsewhere or forever be putting the first 5 pages back into the book."
5,Big!,I really like this case. It holds all of my individual and dual disk set DVDs and I still have a little room left. It zips closed and slides into a shelf in my entertainment center. It seems well made. When opened up it provides easy access to each page. Disks are safely secured 8 to a page. Clear vinyl makes finding what you want easy. For disks with no easy to read titles I used my label maker and affixed it to the vinyl.
5,Great case.,"This case is better than the other case logic cases i own. The reason for this is because this one has disk storage on the inside front cover.As always, another great product from case logic."
2,Does NOT come with the 16 Disc Fast File Insert,"I feel ripped off, I did not get a 208 disc wallet with the extra 16 disc fast file insert as the description claims. Don't be tricked like I was ! It's also quite flimsy, lined with cardboard for support."
2,Case Logic CDW-16,"Not as well made as their other products. Very thin and kinda flimsy. Case made in China. Case Logic quality has gone downhill in recent years, I used to be a fan, but not anymore."
3,NYLON CD CASE,"works great if all you want is just to store old CD's that are thrown out there.It's not the best quality but if what you are looking to just organize your CD's, it does the job.I am satisfied with the product."
3,"great product, quick service, price could be better","The CD wallet arrived quickly and was just as described. I happened to find and purchase another one (as a gift) at a local ALDI store for $ 9.99. This wallet was very similar, maybe not quite as sturdy, but a lot less expensive."
5,Great case,This case is great. It is wonderful to get rid of all those plastic cases. It stores a lots of CDs/DVDs with ease. The only thing I can find negative is when the case is full it can sometime be a little difficult to zip closed.
1,"No handle, pages not removable","I just received this 100 capacity case. I was disappointed because it does not have a handle at all. Also, the pages are not removable. Those were 2 details that I really wanted. This item will be returned."
5,Does the job!,Very Basic but just what we needed. We bought it for about 8 dollars and it does the job. Not super great quality but we just use it to store our cd's.I would definitely recommend it for its price.
3,Case Logic Nylon 336-Disc CD Wallet,"The front cover was bent and mangled when I received it. Apparently, the covers are made of cardboard. This is not very durable compared to my older Fellowes case that holds the same number of CD's. The locking system is great. However, if you load your CD's from top-to-bottom, you will need to remove all the pages to add one to the bottom (assuming that page order even matters). I loaded my CD's from the bottom. The last page is on top. I can add a page to the top without removing the others. I greatly prefer my Fellowes case (but it is old... I don't know how it compares to the new Fellowes cases)."
3,Lots of storage for the price; bad rings.,"Lots of storage for the price; but you can only add or remove pages from the very front . . . which makes it hard to manage a growing, shifting, or changing collection that you want to keep in some sort of order. if the rings opened in the middle it would be perfect."
3,DvD case,a great value for the price. the only bad thing is the cheap zipper on the thing. you cant just grap the zipper and pull. you have to graab the zipper and then with your other hand push in the opposite direction for it to zip up. other than that its great
2,Cheaply made -- a disappointment,"Compared to past Case Logic purchases and to recent purchases of similar no-name products, this Case Logic CD wallet feels very cheap. They nylon is very thin and looks like it will not stand up to much wear and tear. The slots are about half a millimeter too narrow: CDs fit very snugly, while CD liner notes are a struggle to get in and out. Overall, it will suffice, but it's a disappointment. Based on the quality of this product, I will avoid this brand in the future."
4,Definitely Worth Buying,I've had this case for about 3 months now and I'm happy with it. It does exactly what I need it to. I am very picky about scratches on my discs and the discs I put in 3 months ago don't have any sign of scratches or scuff marks. They play fine on my dvd player which is sensitive to scratches. I filled it up a few days ago and actually just bought another one. I would give it a 5 star rating but it loses 1 star in my opinion due to the difficulty to zip it up when it's full and opened all the way. When you open it all the way so that it lays flat and you can flip through the pages it is a bit of a pain to get the zipper started. Once you get it zipped a half inch or so it becomes easy as any zipper should. Over all it's a great case for me and I will buy this case every time I fill up the ones I have.
4,What more can it fit?,"It's big and holds a lot, such is it's good qualities. No damage to any CDs at all, but a lack of a top protector to keep CDs from falling out is noticeable. Buy, but don't turn upside down."
3,save some space.,"Now that my music is in Itunes, I don't need easy access to the originals anymore. This is a good way to store them for posterity... whenever I get around to putting them in the case."
3,CD Case,Its pricey for its appearance and build quality. But lot of space for organizing all ur cds.
4,Compact and Easy to Use!,"This is an amazingly nice case for such an inexpensive price. It is sturdy, high quality, and fit my hundreds of cds nicely in a compact space. I'm thinking of getting another to hold my expanding collection and I may also start putting dvds in it too."
4,DVD Case Continued,Back for my third purchase as my library of movies and TV shows continually expands. Still proves to be a great flexible tool allowing easy way to store and access my collection. Great solution for my needs.
5,Going to buy another one,This worked out very well for us. We travel a lot so we needed to get rid of some weight/volume. CD's were an obvious target so we ripped out the CD covers with the disks and put them in this folder. All the CD's had been ripped to the iPod so I'm not sure how often we'll be looking at them again but at least we can and they are neatly stored.
1,Crappy.,"I bought one of these to store my DVDs in and I absolutely hate it. It&#699;s built like a 3 ring binder, (the page adding feature is what made me want to buy it in the first place) but the binder rings tend to open and the pages either slip or get squished while you&#699;re flipping through the book. My husband and I finally submitted to duct taping the rings shut, and while the pages don&#699;t slip anymore they don&#699;t turn too great either. My suggestion? Pass on this one and find something without rings."
3,Not a gr8 CD wallet,"Dont go by size, though this is bulky it can accomodate very limited CD's & the worst part is you cant add sleves to increase the capacity.There are better options available."
2,CD wallet - too large!,"I bought this case because I got free shipping by getting another item - it is too large, unweildy to handle when filled with CD, though it does hold a lot of discs. The quality seems ok, though because it's so large, it seems flimsy. I'd recommend getting a smaller case."
4,Serves its purpose,"Case logic has been around for year. I know the quality to expect from them and I like it. I only gave it four out of five because it's not exactly 'exciting' to purchase their products. Overall, would always recommend case logic to anybody."
3,Serves the purpose,"The Case Logic Nylon Disc Wallet (CDW208)holds many CD's. I'm not using it for DVD's because I'd like to get something that holds DVD's and the graphics/liner notes. This wallet serves the purpose for CD's because I can keep the liner notes along with the CD, so that I know what songs are on the CD (some CD's aren't printed with the contents, so it helps). It seems sturdy enough, but I don't lug it around with me. It sits on a shelf. Only time will tell if it holds up against moisture, dry rot, etc. So far, so good!"
2,Too Big.,"I thought this size would solve a multitude of problems with all those CD's! It's nice looking, but too big & bulky and hard to zip."
5,CD Case,This I got for someone for Christmas gift.It was on their list and I was told they wanted something notebook like to store their CD's in. I showed it to someone else who knows what this person wanted and it's PERFECT! So I give product my recommendation if you are in need of a nice place to store lots of CD's. Very well made also and I think well worth the price.
1,Skip this one,"There are dozens of storage albums for CD's and DVD's. This is one to avoid. It has just one fault, and that is the zipper. The problem is closing the album. The zipper runs fine for about 1 1/2"". Then it must make a sharp turn, and there is nothing for you to hold onto to keep the zipper straight. This is where the zipper will fail, and then it will not close at all. It opens fine, has good storage, but closing it is a real nuisance.Buy something else."
5,Simple CD/DVD Case,"For the price I paid, this was a giveaway!!! I used to have so many small cases laying around everywhere. Now with this case, I fit five small cases into this huge one with plenty of space left. Thank you Case Logic and Amazon!P.S. People, it's just a CD/DVD holder... It either works or it doesn't and this one DOES WORK!"
4,Excellent Case,"This case is very durable and easy to use. It wouldn't be simple to remove a middle page, but otherwise it's lightweight, durable, and portable (what I wanted)."
2,Low quality product,I have a 50 disk case logic wallet I got a few years ago and it is fairly sturdy. This thing just seems more flimsy to me. The case itself seems weak and the dvd pockets are made of a very thin plastic. My old one seems like a much better item.
3,Does the job,Not attractive for display but it does the job and holds EVERYTHING!Feels flimsy but adequate for archiving DVD's
3,"Lots of room, but still room to improve","I have owned this CD ""wallet"" for about a year and a half now. I purchased it in anticipation of my little daughter discovering my CD tower and the impending destruction that would follow.I chose this one because at the time it had the combination of the largest capacity and the best rating. My one complaint with this product is the weak zipper broke within a month. I have a small CD wallet that holds 20-30 CDs with a zipper three times as burly as the one that came on this.I suppose the zipper is not truly an essential part of the product, but it could be improved GREATLY by simply upgrading this one thing."
5,Bingo!,"I purchased 2 to hold my CDROM's and DVD's. They are well constructed, sturdy, and have a good operational zipper. It appears to be 'one good Bingo.' ...LOL"
4,Great Product,"This CD/DVD wallet is great and exactly what I was looking for. When this one is full, I'm sure to buy another one!! It makes storing my movies and CD's much easier than in their bulky cases!!"
5,Binder DVD Storage,"This is the fourth time I have purchased the same product and have yet to be disappointed. My DVD collection was getting out of hand, even using the thin DVD cases, so I'm using these to hold various TV series such as Bones, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, House, MD, and so forth.Although you may need to take the flat straps completely off (or out) to adjust pages, you won't if you plan ahead."
4,Good Quality for Price,I caught these at a great price ($12.99) and I feel it was a good deal.The case seems sturdy enough. I bought 2 of these but didn't completely fill them in order to leave room for new additions.
5,Good as expected,"Good product as expected, not really tough for the road, but perfect for home use. Will buy again when needed."
4,Was not what expected,"When I ordered the case I was under the impression it had removable pages according to one of the pictures. Turns out the 92 cd size does not have removable pages.The case is very durable but not what I was led to believe was what I was purchasing.With a little more research, I found out the removable version only exists for the large sized cases."
4,"Not a bad quality, but could be better","The quality seems okay, not so great. Okay,Ii was expecting a better quality for the money spend. It would be better if the material that touches the CD/DVD is a little softer. Anyways, I am happy for now, but would love to spend more $$ to see a far better product, yet I can't spend more time to search for it either so this comes in handy and good."
4,Heavy Duty and Sturdy,"I'm moving soon, so instead of hauling a DVD collection, I decided to purchase a disc wallet. This product is by far the best value that I have seen online or in stores. What I really like is that it has a sturdy spine with a handle on the side. Other similar wallets don't have a spine and are very flimsy (and some even cost more). I also like how on the inside of the front cover there are sleeves - this works great for discs that you will use more often, like video games. This will definitely protect your DVD/game collection. Highly recommend."
4,Better design,"I've been using Case Logic cases for years - probably since at least the early 1990's. I have never had an issue. I like the updated design of this one, specifically the ""easy grab"" slots for the commonly used discs.My only beef with it is the fabric seems to be a little less quality than the last multi-disc case I purchased (5 years ago).Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with their products."
2,Poor Quality,The material used around the zipper pulled out of the seam just a couple of days after we got it. There are a few reviews on here already complaining about this. I like how many DVD's it stores but I don't love that we have to already be so careful in how we hold it so it doesn't rip more and completely ruin.
5,Perfect for us,This product was perfect for our needs. We had hundreds of movies and needed to ditch the plastic and make room. The wallet is well constructed and the sleeves are easy to use. It works great for movies or music.
3,Ok,Its not as sturdy as i expected. Its an okay product and does the job though. Not sure if ill buy it again
2,Not exactly what was promised,"Definitely will hold a lot of CD's but he advertised pockets were missing. I purchased this one for the pockets so I could keep all of the booklets in now, they just fall to the ground every time I unzip it. I wish I had sent it back, but had already thrown the box out. Stuck with it."
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I've ordered a couple of these in the past and really liked them, sturdy and well made. Ordered another unit a little while ago and they have really changed the quality of materials used, very thin cheap materials. Used to be that one of these would stand upright on its side even with some discs in it, now with a few discs inside mine basically collapses because the construction materials are so thin. I can't really recommend these anymore, sad because they used to be one of the best choices."
1,Product shipped was not as advertised on website,"Unfortunately the photos of this product were not the same as the product shipped. We have several other case logic CD cases, which all have black pages with full square pockets that accommodate liner notes as well as CDs. The product we received looked the same as the others from the outside, with the nylon cover and zipper, but inside it was a three ring binder, with white binder pages that had CD pockets with the corners sewn, preventing insertion of any liner notes. Unfortunately we don't trust that we'll get the right thing if we order again, so we will try to find another of these in person."
5,Organize and save space,I was able to get rid of DVD AND CD cases and save space and find my discs without going through bookshelves and drawers. Now I can sit and open it up and find what I need very easy. I have my CD'S of pictures in here also. If we ever move I can grab and go without a lot of boxes to pack.
5,Super!,"Holds up amazingly. I have had this for over a year and it does the job. Has been dropped, borrowed, soaked many times and protects perfectly. Backing does not scratch CDs."
4,Plenty of space for few bucks,"This case makes it work perfectly even considering that its interior is made of cheap plastic....anyway, is reistent enough for the use that I am giving to it. I am happy with this purchase"
2,"Not a good quality, cheaply built, zip does not work properly","First ever review !! bad enough to compel me to write. I bought this seeing the photos which looked quite good. Disappointed as it is cheaply made, not sturdy, it is filmsy. The zip will not close properly once completely open. The sleeves require a efforts to hold the inserts films open with both hands,, just can't slide the disks in the inserts. will not recommned."
4,Great disc wallet,"This is just your average 32 capacity disc wallet. It is, however, more well made than most, and I think it will last me quite awhile."
4,Case Logic CD/DVD Wallet,"Great Price, will work for what I need but looks like it frequent usage will cause wear and tear easily since the case is made of cheap material."
4,Great storage concept,"This product is great!!! We love the front pockets. Only problem is that if you need to insert / remove a page from the middle or back, you have to pull out all the pages in front of that page to get at it. Aside from that, there really are no complaints. This product is well made and should last a very long time."
3,Case Logic disc/cd holder,This is wonderful for holding multiple cds. I like it very much except for the zipper which is very difficult when closing the case. It is like an aerobic feat to do this. Otherwise I really like it very much.
4,Really really big,"Wow, this thing is big. The face is about the size of a 3-ring binder, but it's at least 3 inches deep. It seems very sturdy, and will hold all my CDs and DVDs, but I realised belatedly that this means that my 3 year old's Dora and Raffi DVDs are in the same place as my, uh, ""Disturbia"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" DVDs. It would be better if I could keep those in different cases, so my toddler wouldn't accidentally get into DVDs that are inappropriate for him. It's also heavy, and isn't even full yet, but it has a sturdy carrying handle (an improvement over my other older model) so I think it's a good purchase. If I did it again, I would buy 3, each one-third the size of this one.It DOES fulfill the function that the kids are eager to put their CDs/DVDs back after watching them, and the slots are easy to get the discs into, so I hope it will solve the problem of discs that get scratched, lost, or misfiled, by small kids. I'll probably buy another smaller one for the kids' stuff."
5,Nice,"Arrived fast, looks just like it did on the sight. Not much to say other than it looks and feels durable!"
5,Birthday gift,"I bought this for my son so he could put all his dvd's or cd's in it and be able to carry it with him where ever he goes, good item"
1,Pages rip out after 6-12 months,"I loved this at first, and I am willing to bet the that ""good"" reviews are based on immediate use. Less than 12 months ago I purchased several of these CD/DVD cases, and all five have fallen apart with gentle, typical household use. If you look at the picture you will see two plastic straps holding the individual CD/DVD pages in place. Unfortunately, as you flip through through the holder, the two solid plastic straps begin to cut and wear away the thin plastic pages they hold. The pages eventually fall out and the CD/DVD holder is then useless. They were the WORST waste of money; do not buy."
1,Big problem not yet mentioned,"One large problem that I have yet to see mentioned is the following.You will probably be adding your discs in the wallet by Genre, and then alphabetically sorting either by artist or titleAs you fill the book, every time you want to add a new disc, (ie Carly Simon), but all the spaces between ""R"" and ""T"" are taken, you have to remove all the pages to fit one in where the ""S"" are to accomodate your new disc.In a normal binder where the rings split in the middle, you can flip past the last ""S"" page and add a new page there. However since these rings force you to add a page in the front, you have to remove them all every time you add a page. The second problem is that because these pages have ""slits"" for holes and not ""circular"" holes, replacing the pages in the binder is a real pain.Be forwarned. this is not a problem if your collection is not growing. But if it is, it will likely quickly grow disorganized due to the difficulty in adding new pages where they need to be!"
4,Great price and product,"I just purchased a second one. I use them for my computers Discs. I use one for Programs and the other will be for Data. I was going to buy a 200+ capacity, but I think it would have been too big and heavy. The smaller one is great and easy to store and access.You cannot move pages. Very easy to flip pages even when full. I have some pockets with the notes and a disc, and a couple with 2 discs in the same pocket.Product is 'Made in China', which I avoid but this is a great product."
2,How the mighty have fallen,"Case Logic cases were once the epitome. I have bought over 2 dozen of their cases over many years, and still have all of them. Their overall design, craftmanship, materials and selection have all gone down, while prices have gone up.They used to provide a hard leather cover with precision metal fasteners, which have lasted me over 20 years. Now I get a very thin nylon membrane over cardboard, with cheap plastic fittings that are poorly assembled and do not last.I have no complaints about the seller; just the manufacturer.The ad claims ""Durable padded outer-material resistant to heat, moisture, and tearing"". Resistant by what yardstick? It certainly doesn't ""resist"" very vigorously, by my standard."
4,Probably the best option for storing a large number of cds,"When I was attempting to transport my 300+ cd collection 1000 miles to school, I went looking for the largest case available, and this was it.Overall, it's a good case. The cds have been well protected. They don't scratch and the pages are tight enough that they don't slip out if stored upside down. The handle is really strong, and I've had no ripping even carrying the case entirely filled.The one problem I have come across is with the zipper. I put a lot of heavy wear on this case recently, so for normal use it will probably be okay. But the zipper on my case has recently started to seperate from material, making it really difficult to zip up. For storage around my room, it is still wonderful, but it does make it a lot more difficult to travel with."
2,No Liner Notes,"I bought this trying to replace an old off-brand CD Wallet that I purchased many years ago which has a nasty tendency to rip the paint off of the CDs (not too healthy for CDs). Case Logic's CD slots are very gentle on CDs and a that's one of the strong points of this product.What renders this product useless is that it doesn't hold the liner notes (album covers). They just plain do not fit into the slots. I have an older model of this same case that works perfectly fine, but none of the dozen or so covers that I've tried fits into this newer model. Am I the only one who like to have album covers?!?!? I called and complained to Case Logic but they didn't have anything useful to say.In conclusion, if you don't want your album covers with your CDs, this is a fine product, but if you do want album covers with CDs, find another product -- I'm still looking."
5,very nice,"I like the construction of this case. It's a little pricey but if you can get this on sale, it's worth it. Looks nice too."
1,Returned in a heart beat.....,"As soon as I received this case I returned it. You can not add or move with this case. I have a 800+ alpha DVD collection and no why was I using these case.PLease bring back the 3 ring zipper binders(large)and the top load refill pages...please, please, please."
3,"Go for the bigger one, it's almost the same price.","the one that holds 336 is the same thing really, so why not just get that one. i got both to see what they were like, as we have thousands of cds we need to archive. i don't really like these cases, they are ugly and look tacky on the shelf...but i have not seen a better product by any other company, so what to do?"
5,My favorite CD/DVD Case,"I've gone through a few cases to hold discs but stopped searching when I bought the 128 capacity one about 8 mo. ago. Now I can hold all my DVD's (who uses CD's anymore)... This is the best option you can go for and its relatively cheap on amazon.com.Pro: Sturdy steel zipper, Strong oustside Nylon Case, CD's do not come out of the pocket, Each sleeve is secure and I feel confident they're not going to rip.Con: The only thing I don't like about this is how hard it is to insert new sleeves. It's not like a three ring binder where you can insert sleeves where ever you please. If you want to insert one in the back of the book, you have to remove all the other ones.Anyway, buy this DVD/CD? Wallet.. you won't be disappointed."
3,Good Price-Cheaply Made,The outside of this case seems to be made of reinforced cardboard. I received an email the next day for a way better item.
1,Different from first two photos,"As of May 17, 2012, the 64 CD version shows one look in the first and second photos, while it is a different look / design in the third photo. I didn't think it can look different before ordering... and I ordered according to the look of the first and second photo.And the item arrived... it is the one in the third photo... I don't know whether the problem will be fixed later on (I am going to return it and mention it to the customer service). Hopefully it is fixed by the time you read this comment."
3,"Good capacity, good looks, poor usability","I bought two of these knowing that I'd only put two CDs per page side (four per ""page""). Everything fit well and I probably could have put two CDs in a single slot if I needed to without much issues. However - as has been noted before - if you need to rearrange the pages it's a HUGE PAIN. You need to take everything out and put it back in and it is not a quick process. But once you dial it in it's pretty easy to turn pages and look at everything."
4,Huge,"This is fine for what it is, but I was surprised at the size given that I had other 96 disk wallets and was used to a certain profile. I found it to be a lot larger in all dimensions than I expected or wanted."
4,NICE STORAGE OPTION,AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS I WAS A BIT HESITANT TO PURCHASE THIS CASE BUT I DECIDED TO TRY IT ANYWAY. IM SO GLAD I DID. THANKS TO THIS CASE 1)IVE DUMPED OVER 300 DVD CASES IN THE GARBAGE AND 2)IVE RECLAIMED 4 SHELVES IN MY WALL UNIT THAT HAVE BEEN OVERSTUFFED WITH DVDS SINCE I DONT KNOW WHEN. ITS A WONDERFUL THING (THIS CASE) ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT HATES THE SIGHT OF CLUTTER. MY ONE COMPLAINT WOULD BE ABOUT THE ZIPPER THAT SOMETIMES DISAPPEARS WHEN THE CASE IS OPENED ALL THE WAY. AFTER FOLDING THE CASE CLOSED I HAVE TO STICK MY FINGER IN THE SPACE TO RECLAIM THE ZIPPER. OTHER THAN THAT I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. THE SLEEVES ARE A GOOD SIZE DVDS SLIDE IN AND OUT WITHOUT A PROBLEM. UNLIKE OTHER REVIEWERS I HAVENT HAD THE PROBLEMS OF DVDS SLIDING OUT WHEN THE CASE IS MOVED AROUND NOR HAVE I EXPERIENCED DVDS BEING SCRATCHED UPON REMOVAL.
5,GOOD SIZE!,I really liked this CD wallet. Im going to use it for my movies i have lots and is a good way to keep them organized.
4,Excellent other than the zipper,"Great product, very durable as is to be expected. Much wider than the picture suggests. My only complaint is the zipper; it is rather difficult to get it into the ""zipping position"" after the case has been opened all the way. One other minor quirk is the new trapping system: it can be annoying to move around the pages, but the durability of the plastic holders more than makes up for the effort.Other than that, great product, I definitely recommend it."
5,Great Quality,The cd case was just what we were looking for to organize our family wii games and have easy removal for our kids.
5,Exactly as described!,I love the sturdiness of this dvd case. The inserts included made this a great purchase. I would buy this again.
5,Very reliable cd/dvd case,"I have 2 other similar cases from Case Logic. All have lasted a long time and wear very well. My kids use them for their video games, and considering how tough kids can be on things that says a lot. I'm very pleased I can still find them on Amazon!"
2,Neither well made nor easy to use,"I own two of these things. The zipper on one of them broke within a week. The ""Quick Lock"" system really doesn't lock the pages securely, and they're always coming loose. And it really is a pain trying to reorganise CDs, since you can't just add or remove one page at a time.For customers in Ireland or Britain, a much better wallet is available from Maplins - it uses a simple ring binder system so you really can insert or remove pages quickly. I'd advise American customers to shop around for something like that - somebody must sell it!"
2,Fell apart after only a few weeks,"BAD: I bought two of these so that I could dispense with my jewel cases.I thought they served the purpose, BUT... after only a few weeks and very little use the tab that holds the CDs in (akin to the rings of a 3-ring-binder) no longer hold. My sister went to put it away tonight and half of the pages fell out. What a pain! I am also in agreement with the reviewer that said the 3-ring-replacement here is not very user-friendly, even when it does work as intended. If you need to switch pages around, you have to take everything in front of it out. UGh! I do not recommend.GOOD: Nice looking, holds lots of CDs."
4,Just what I wanted,"I recently threw out my jewel cases for my CD's and put everything into two of these cases. It's great - so easy to see what I have and easy to store. The only drawback is the way the plastic sheets go in (would be nicer as a binder because now you have to take them all out then back on) but otherwise, a great product. Durable, too, so far."
4,A real space saver,"I had CDs all over the place until someone told me about these books. I have 2 of these. I bought the largest one (320) at Best Buy. But this is a far better price for the next largest one. It was a pain to zip up, until I discovered the trick. Start the zipper until it stops. Then put your finger behind the zipper to give it support while you move the zipper up further."
5,great product,"This product is great but what's up with the price increase. I went to buy more and they are $8.00 more than when I purchased last time. Easy to flip through, easy to store under the TV"
4,Great Case!!,"Definitely recommend this case. It's definitely good for me since I have tons of DVD's to fill it up. A little heavy when full, but hey, that's a lot of DVD's in there. Good buy if you need a big case."
2,Much room for improvement,"I decided to buy this product because my cds were getting wrecked keeping them stacked as they were when they were in their unburned state. I saw this large carrying case in Staples and then I found it on Amazon for less than half the price and free shipping. However, it is really not up to the challenge- the binder is flimsy and the zipper is just about impossible to operate. The pages are minimally capable of protecting the cds- offering just slightly better defense against audio destruction than stacking. Conclusion- if you're as desperate as I was for something that's better than nothing, then this is the product for you. Otherwise I'd suggest keep on looking."
5,Convenient for home or car,I have two. I use one in my car for CDs and one at home for DVD. It looks good. Easy to store. Ease to get disks in and out. Helps me keep disks organize. Good buy.
4,Huge capacity...,This item has the potential for holding a lot of cd's or dvd's. My concern is that the zipper and the material that the zipper holds together is rather flimsy and I wonder if this will withstand full capacity without ripping or tearing. It doesn't seem like it was built to stand up to much wear and tear (even just basic everyday stuff). I don't have enough cd's or dvd's at the moment to test out what full capacity would be like but wanted to make sure that I posted my concerns for other potential buyers. Price seems kind of high for the material that this is made of.
4,"Simple, functional case","Nothing fancy about this case, but it works perfectly for holding my DVD collection. Would recommend as a nice low-cost option."
4,"fantastic price, great quality","The price is awesome! Paid $13 for this and similar items in stores were at least $40. This would've received 5 stars, BUT the price was raised to $28 when I tried to order another one a few days later!"
4,Worth the cost,"Product came on time....was exactly what I expected. Holds dvd's well......worth the price. We use it for my daughters movie, it's easy for her to browse through and see what see wants to watch."
1,this is junk,"I own 5 case logic cd cases,and all the previous ones were great. This one is pure crapp. It takes 2 hands and plenty of useless time to close the zipper. I think they used material that was way too thin, and added way too much,making closing this thing a chore. The zipper intself is extra clunky and nearly impossible to deal with. I suspect that the screw-up is the nylon. Buy anything else"
3,Case Logic Review,"The zipper is a PIA. Jeweled cases will not fit. Nice idea to add pages. I guess, for the price it is OK."
1,Ripoff - Not Like the Pictures,"Unfortunately, this product is being misrepresented in the pictures. I ordered the 100 capacity folder and it has neither the strap on the spine nor the plastic ""rings"" that the pages ride along. The flimsy pages are sewn directly in. The whole thing is very shabby and is very very light. I doubt it will last more than a few weeks unless you were to store it and never unzip it. I'm very disappointed in Case Logic for this terrible product."
2,Nice 64 piece case but missing it's handle!,I ordered this item because the picture clearly shows a handle on the binder edge. When received it does not have a handle! I wouldn't have ordered this had I known there wasn't a handle! It is not worth returning so I will keep but I'm unhappy! Please remove pictures one and two from this item so others will not be mislead!
4,Great for adults and kids,"I bought this case for my 3 year old. She doesn't have 100 DVDs, but I wanted something that she could put her DVDs in and have room to grow. It's perfect for her. I don't have to worry about all of the DVD jackets being everywhere anymore either."
4,"great wallet, doesn't fit liner notes","I purchased this CD wallet to eliminate my 2 towers of jewel cases. It fits all my CDs, and seems pretty sturdy. My only complaint is that you can't fit a CD with its liner notes in the same sleeve. You could put a CD in one sleeve and the liner notes next to it in another sleeve, but not both. I ended up cutting off the first page of each set of liner notes, and putting just that one page in with each CD so it's easy for me to find a CD by cover art. Also, the description is confusing about how many CDs it holds. It has 26 pages that hold 8 CDs each, which makes 208 CDs, PLUS slots for 16 more CDs inside the front cover. Therefore it holds a total of 224 CDs in the entire wallet."
3,barely OK,case logic usually has much better quality. get what you pay for. i was hoping for something made of better materials.
4,good storage solution,"I had an older case logic binder which was great. When I needed more storage space I thought I'd purchase another case logic. The model I had before no longer existed so I went with this one. It's a good build and it works well. It's not too big as some reviewers suggest. The plastic sleeves that hold the CDs are cheap, even cheaper than the ones that came in my old case logic binder...but they seem to get the job done...and they're probably equivalent to other sleeves on the market. Would recommend and/or buy another if needed."
4,Great cases- we ordered 3!,"We weren't listening to our cds because they were in jewel cases on a shelf in another room and it just wasn't convenient. We ordered 3 of these cd cases and we've put all of our cds in them. It's so much more organized. And now our toddler can't access them. He was carrying the jewel cases all over the house because we didn't have a good place to keep them before. We really like it. The cases seem pretty durable. But wow, they sure are heavy when they're full. I recommend them!"
4,Great Case!,"Although I used thi case to put in both CD's and their covers and couldn't fill it up all the way because it just got too bulky, I still was able to fill it (minus 3 pages front and back) with no problem. Awesome product."
3,A couple of design flaws,"The zippers are really lightweight and flimsy. If you open the wallet all the way, the zipper gets ""stuck"" in the corner because it's not sturdy enough. It requires some tugging and positioning to get it to work. There is also no way to label these on the outside, so if you have multiples be prepared for lots of openening and closing to figure out which wallet you're in. This just leads to more zippers getting stuck."
4,Encyclopedia of US Army Insignia & Uniforms,This is a great reference book if you are a Militaria collector.
4,"Great Book Explaining the ""Killer Bee"" phenomenon","This book ranks as one of the best books I have read on the subject of Africanized Honey Bees. (aka Killer Bees) This book is easily understood by the layperson, yet full of great data for the serious student of this exotic pest. From Texas to California, we have to learn how to live with this creature - it is not going away! I strongly recommend this book. While I have been teaching classes on the subject of Africanized Honey Bees for the better part of a decade, I still keep this book handy as a reference, and recommend it to my students."
3,Description probably not correct!,"When I first read the description of this product I believed the item included the tripod and Rod. It says ""Trimble Spectra Precision Laser AL224 24X Automatic Optical Level Kit Includes: 2161 Tripod, 10' Inch Rod and Case."" However upon receiving it there was no tripod or rod. I called Amazon and they said return what I got and they would send out a new one with the tripod and rod. It came the next day!! but still no tripod or rod. In re-reading the description I think Amazon is NOT selling the ""Kit"" but just the head. I was VERY satisfied with Amazons Customer Service throughout this problem and the problem has been resolved to my satisfaction."
5,Sounds Great!!!,This album sounds really good! A friend of mine from Toronto sent me this CD and I have to say that this is one of my favourite CDs in my large collection. I would love to here them live in a concert setting. There band sounds super tight. It's really hard to say which songs I like the most because I like them all. I hope to hear more albums from them in the future.
1,cheap plastic,"The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."
1,Suncast 175' Hose Job,"This is a terrible product. I have used it for a year now. It is flimsy, bends and flexes far too much when it is cranked or moved. I think it is made of flexible vinyl or polyethylene. This is the wrong type of plastic for this application unless it is very thick. The wheels fall off. It bounces when moved because the wheels are either out of round or hang up on the axle. I heavily greased the axel, but that had no effect. I usually give products a good review, but this thing is horrible!"
2,hose reel,"This hose reel is misleading. It may hold 175' of thin wall hose, but it has trouble holding 100' of a heavier hose. I was able to buy a different hose reel that holds more hose (it is much larger) from Walmart for less money than I paid for this one."
1,Many leakages!!,"Bought it few months ago. Since day one, the item start leaking.It doesn't perform at all.The plastic is not durable and costs too much."
1,Piece of junk,I've had two of these. The first lasted less than one year before self-destructing. The second one lasted less than one season before coming apart. Do yourself a favor and stay away from ALL Suncast products.
1,Falls apart quickly,"I bought two of these (for front and back yard) and both of them are now dead. First one lasted 2 years, second- three years of gentle use. The reason of death in both cases is that the plastic part on the side of the cart to which the short hose connects(the one that came with the cart) shoots out of the cart under the pressure of the water and water gushes through the hole. Replacement of the 2 rubber O-rings on the part did not help."
1,"Very, very fragile","I just finished using this for the first time and already the wheels are starting to wobble. I believe the impact of trying move it, with the weight of a mounted hose, placed too much stress on the very thin plastic. The wobble makes it now difficult to move further, defeating the purpose of the ""mobile."" I don't anticipate the whole thing will last very long. I am very disappointed in this product and feel my money is basically wasted. I will not buy this brand, nor probably any plastic hose reel, again."
1,Not even worth the reduced pricel,"I used this item about 6 times and it cracked . This is either not really dishwasher safe (I washed on top d/w shelf only). Also, I didn't even heat up in microwave. So there is really no excuse. Just badly made glass. Caveat emptor!!"
2,heavy glass with bubbles,"Well, I'm really bummed because I liked how this gravy boat looked. It was very simple but classic and I thought it would match any china pattern.... well upon inspection this gravy boat is really poor quality. It is heavy glass but there are bubbles in both the ladle and boat. Some parts of the ladle weren't even smooth. The handle on the boat was cheaply adhered to the bowl with a crack in it that looks like was super glued or something."
5,Wonderful series,All I can say is Why oh why won't they release this on DVD along with the other two parts of the series?!
3,Nice film cropped transfer,Olive film has artificially transformed the format from 1.33 to 1.85 cutting the superior and inferior borders of the image.Knock on Wood
2,Disappointing,"As stated by another reviewer, the book has just a few black & white small illustrations: the cover is deceitful. And I don't know what to do with such poems as ""Don't write poems about what's happening. / Nothing is born or dies in poetry's presence. / Next to it, life is a static sun / without warm or light..."" (Carlos Drummond de Andrade, a poet I appreciate, but not for children). There are too many abstract, religious and moral topics, and the pleasure of playing with words and worlds is scarce."
3,Review from a mom,"I liked the book but was a bit disappointed in some of the poem selections.Overall, a good purchase for our family.Not great for children under eight."
5,Perfect Poetry Book for kids,This book is the perfect poetry book for youth. It has an array of different authors and different levels. I have used it for my children ages 3rd grade and up. All styles are represented. I even recommended it to a teacher and she ordered it that week!
3,Terrible copyediting,"I read this awhile ago, so I won't try to address the book's ideas in detail. Suffice it to say, I was sympathetic to the authors' points - I'm a vegetarian - but thought Singer's Animal Liberation was better. I'm posting at this late date because the book popped into my mind again just yesterday as one of the most poorly edited books I have ever encountered. I assume the paperback is better, but honestly, the number of editing errors in the hardcover set a new standard for poor. I remember thinking that even the draft submitted by the authors to the publisher should have been cleaner than this finished book. Really, really terrible. A minor point, I'll grant, but perhaps of interest to the detail-oriented."
3,"A real challenge, good for a team project.","IF you can answer the most questions by Sept. 12, 2000 you can win $25,000 (or split it with the other winners). Hints are throughout the book and updates and hints are on the website. example; A33.Who was the only speaking role in Silent Movie? Clue on website is ""A33. The least obvious."" (I discovered it is the mime, played by Marcel Marceau.) You need at least 940 correct out of 1,566 to be in the contest. There are other such contest books, but this one has the highest cash prize to date. There is some trivia in the book. But it is mostly questions. No answers."
2,Too many questions,"Since there are so many questions, naturally many of them are uninteresting. On the other hand, the book ""Quizzing"" which has less questions was a much better read."
5,Great Euro/Trance!,"This is a cover of the 80's tune by Journey. Dee Robert (who last wrote ""One Good Reason"" for Nicole J Mccloud) is back in full force with this dance floor anthem. Very much in the same vein as DJ Sammy ""Heaven"" and DJ Encore ""I See Right Thru To You"", this could be the next ""I Turn To You""!"
2,you get what you pay for,"this book is cheap, and teaches little. i'd reccomend spending more to get a better book. this one is confusing."
2,Poor flask,"Well, it worked for what it was intended to do... for a while. Eventually, the bottom cracked and it broke. I found nearly the same exact thing (with a different label) at walmart for 3 dollars. If I wanted to buy a cheap easily crackable flask I could have saved myself 20 some dollars and just got the cheapo one at walmart. The only issue with the walmart flask was a huge sticker on it, I fixed that up right away with lighter fluid."
1,poor quality,"I was able to use this for about a month, at first I thought I hadn't tightened the cap entirely and was spilling the contents. However now it is clearly leaking, at the top left side, the seam wasn't welded correctly and it is now falling apart."
4,Excellent value,Slight learning curve. Made the job of hanging drywall a breeze. I'm a woman and this driver was light weight and easy to operate.
5,Senco Screw Gun,"At $99, this screw gun is a STEAL!!! I've put the screw gun through drywall, wood, fencing, decking, and it hold up VERY well. It is very well made and the speed that I can get projects done at now is well worth the money. A+ product"
4,Outstanding,"The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are times the screws get hung up in the head. I'm building a deck around my pool and did the first 20 feet by hand (drill and individual screws). Even with the occasional jams, this has made the job go 100% faster... and should something happen to it, I'd purchase the same gun again."
3,Ehhh...,"OK, if you don't have a shitload of drywall to hang. Works good until you drive a screw in crooked--then it is impossible for this thing to drive ANY screw in STARINGHT."
4,Drywalling fun,"Made hanging drywall a breeze and fast. It took a couple of test screws adjusting to its operation. Loading screws a little tricky, having never used a collated screwdriver before but once screwing saved tons of time. Well worth the money."
3,Missing pieces,"Just received this product, and it is missing the bits and adjustment wrenches, so I haven't been able try this out yet. I will update the review after I see how Senco deals with the missing pieces."
4,Good tool for a great price!,"I purchased this tool in preparation for my conversion of part of my garage into a large bathroom suite since I had a lot of gypsum and concrete board to install on walls. This is a nice belt-fed screw gun that will defin itely save time - especially if you are working without any help. You can sink screws while you hold the board. This tool does take an ""acquired touch"" to work well all the time. You must apply the tool almost perfectly perpendicular to the work surface and apply the ""right"" constant force to sink the screw properly - which is usually difficult when you have the gun high over your head. I have a small standard screw gun next to me so I can fully sink the few screws that dont fully embed. I am happy with this tool and would recommend it. It has a nice case, is good quality and you will spend the same money on a standard hand-fed drywall gun."
2,"Senco 1R0004N DS200-AC Duraspin 3,300 RPM...",This product being a refurbished item never worked right from day one! I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it!
2,Can you say BORING?,This game just doesen't cut it. I was expecting more of a Tony Hawk style play. Controls are slow and the game is not interesting at all.
1,Tony Hawk this is NOT...,"THPS is so much fun, and it has infinate replay value, so this should too, right? Sadly, no. Only 2 tricks are customizeable, but that's not the problem. No one has ever heard of any of the guys, except maybe the ""Slim Jim"" mascot, but characters' names don't matter, either. So what is the problem? SPEED. Think about it, in THPS, you start out fast, you recover fast, and you never really slow down. In this, you go slow until you hit a hill, take 20 minutes to get up, and once you stop--you take your sweet time speeding up again. (Ever ride an actual single-speed bike? Hard to pedal, right? Espescially up hills. Same here, you pedal like crazy and go nowhere. [But you get there fast!]) Seriously, pre-order THPS3 and steer clear of this."
4,rent it and see if you like it,"It's pretty cool, not as cool as tony hawk, the game's cool, but the controller configuration's hard.The music's cool, and I like ""moment of truth"" (gangstars), but the best track's ozzie osbourn!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Dave Mirra 2 is starting to age...,"When Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 was first released in 2001,it was pretty fun for the time.But extreme sports games have come much farther ever since then.With hot games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and the underappreciated Aggresive Inline pushing the extreme sports boundries so far these days,there is really no reason to buy Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2.I will have to give it some credit though:it features huge,well designed levels(athough you can sometimes get lost in them they are so big.)and the soundtrack is actually pretty good(it features artists like Subline,Gang Starr,The Cult,Rage Against the Machine,and more).That will only get it so far though.I suggest you should skip this title and move on with your life because you aren't really missing much if you don't buy or play Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2."
4,"super graphics, not super controls","this is a very good game, well worth the money.however the game sometimes stalls when the soundtrackis changing. but besides that the game is great."
3,a bmx game with a good soundtrack,"A good game within its own category considering its a extreme sports game. It joins the ranks of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but does not live up to THPS standards.However, the soundtrack is impressive enough to keep you somewhat entertained as you bike your way through the levels. It is a mediocre game but not of THPS quality so unless you have a passion for BMX then you should keep some distance from this game."
3,meh,"the book's good if you'r really into the obey giant type stuff. it doesn't have much text, and is really thin. i also wished it covered more of his non-giant work, and more recent graphic design work. but if you like seeing the giant in the star a lot, more power to you."
5,"Very good, as usual","This book is sort of a ""debrief"" of self defense incidents, both LE and civilian. Almost a dozen and a half are covered. ""American Hangunner"" features a column ""The Ayoob Files"", several incidents recounted herein are previously unpublished. This is an excellent book for any one who is self protection oriented, making it as thoughtful for civilians AND police officers. If you wear a firearm, you should read this book, and as many of his others. It is well worth the investment of 15 dollars."
5,Great read if you are into true crime - very detailed and technical also,"Another great Ayoob book. Many true stories of true crime and self defense. If you are thinking of getting a gun for self defense, read this book."
3,Chameleon,"An interesting movie, but not quite as good as I had expected. A very good story-line; I guess it shows how that a con-man doesn't have to try too hard, if the victim is gullible. It reminds me of years ago, when adults just didn't tell everything that they know, to kids. Mother always knows more than she tells."
5,Grip On Tools 3000lb Winch,"I looked around for an economical winch that I could buy to load my ATV into the back of my F150 pick-up truck. It's just too dangerous driving it up the ramps yourself. I selected the Grip On winch because it was only one of a few that had a wireless remote control and a handle bar rocker switch. I attached an eye bolt to the bed of my pick-up, I then attach the winch cable to the eye bolt, and then stand back a few feet and watch the winch do all the work! The installation went smoothly and wiring was a snap to install. I've only had it a couple of months now, but the people at Sportsmen's Den who sells the winch said they stand behind everything they sell, 100%. I've also recommended this product to my friends, and would also recommend this to anyone interested in an ecomonical winch."
2,to weak,Had to buy another wench. not real happy with product. Also when i got it the remote was turned on and the battery was dead...
5,The most realism to a boxing game,"The best boxing game so far. Delivers everything so much better than knockout kings. After practicing with the analog stick, you get the hang of the control after about five fights. The game is hard to master but fun to play. I still like the Knockout Kings series, but this game is everything that the Ps2 version of Knockout Kings 2001 should have been znd what knockout kings 2002 tried to be. If you are impatient and unwilling to learn you probably won't like this game."
3,Japanese Boxing?,"This is your typical quirky japanese style video game.You play as a boxer through story mode,and fight a bunch of other boxers in different venues.There is also a single match mode,where you and the computer or a second player can have a single match.The boxers that are beaten in story mode are unlocked and can be used for the single match mode.The gameplay in this game is fair,but very far from perfect.The controls can be a bit sloppy sometimes,and it defintaly takes some time to get used to.The graphics are very outdated,but the music is pretty good.Overall,Victorious Boxers is decent as best.The lack of game modes and the sluggish controls really hurt this game.If you're looking for a really good boxing game for the ps2,you're better off just buying one of the Fight Night games instead and just leaving this title alone."
1,Full of Redundancy...,"I am wondering why Sony even let this game published for their PS2. This game is nothing but repeat. It gets boring when you reach to the 1/3 of the game because you know you're going to play the same thing over and over.Game Control - No Good.Game Graphics - Could be better.Story Line - Boring.I don't really care if this game derived directly from the Japanese comics. The comic is good and the story is well developed, but the this game is aweful! If the game maker of this game is trying to use the Top 5 Comic book to advertise their boxing game... The game is poorly designed and will ruined both Sony and the comic artist's reputations."
2,"Hard to control, I guess it isn't half bad","I rented Victorious Boxers over the weekend and I could say I diffiantly have played better games. You play as this guy trying to reach the top of boxing. The game is mildly frustrating because of the controls, it is very hard to move around the ring. Most of the guys you fight are way better than you, basically your guy is a piece of CRAP! The punches are hard to master. The thing that really got me was that it said on the box you would be training your guy to make him better but all you do is box people who are better than you. The graphics are okay but it doesn't make up for its horrible game play. It's fun to knockeople out though. If you don't have a life and you're a loser please go ahead and buy this game!"
4,FOR TRUE BOXING FANS,"Like many other gamers wrote before me, I also had low expectations for this game when I purchased it. Another drawback for me was that I got it used and it didn't have the manual. However, after taking some time to learn the controls, I found the game addictive.The best feature about the game is that your character does need to use boxing skills to prevail. Some of the opponents are sort of goofy looking, but you tend to overlook that when they start pounding on you in the ring.I'm in agreement that the inability to block punches takes away from game being near perfect, but for me, Victorious Boxers blows away Knockout Kings. This is coming from a huge EA fan, too.My PS2 will only play silver-back discs, now. Thank goodness this game is one of the ones I can use. I don't even miss the Knockout Kings 2001/02 I have. Get this game. You won't be disappointed."
5,The Greatest Boxing Game ever!!!!!,"From the first time I saw this game in the local movie store, I knew it would be fun. Victorious Boxers has it all. An abundance of boxers, unique gameplay and control, realism, and a good replay value. The fighters are based on a Japanimation cartoon called Hajime No Ippo, so don't expect Tyson or Lewis in here. But every fighter has its own style, so you will learn various styles. The one thing that isn't so good is the voice acting in Story Mode. Every round, it's the same thing. But anyway, this is the greatest boxing game around..."
2,Much smaller than I expected.,These earrings are EXTREMELY tiny. Make sure you pay close attention to the dimensions before purchasing.
5,Laser Receiver,"This laser receiver enables machine grading at a fraction of the cost of permanent mounted systems. You can use the magnetic mounts directly to attach to the machine blade, backhoe or make an extension mount from angle iron and a couple of 4"" ceramic magnets. Either way, it attaches firmly and can be moved between machines."
5,Dean Markley FT1000 D,WE bought this for a friend. He loves it. We have one that my husband uses with his Autoharp. Great bargain.
2,And Filmed on Location,Too many chapters are superficial. The author's spend many pages on each movie going over the plot and other well known details and then give only 2-3 comparison/contrasting points between the movie and the 'true story' Woulda been better covering 50 movies and providing more historical scholarly work.
2,Won't play in color,"My DVD player was defective out of the box. It would only play black and white, no color. Since I purchased it through target.com now my options are to send it back (at my cost) and try to get it repaired or take it back to a Target store and try to exchange it if they have one in stock. Otherwise I'll get stuck with store credit."
1,Don't buy!!,"Don't waste your time or money on this portable DVD player. We bought it and were highly disappointed. We either had very washed out color on the screen or absolutely no color at all. It continually flashed to black and white. Other times there was a little color while other parts of the picture were in black and white. Don't bother buying it, you will only end up taking it back like we did."
4,Overall a good product,"The Polaroid PDV 077PT loads the DVD pretty quickly. Picture quality is avarage but not bad. The DVD player is very quiet sounding, and the screen swivals pretty good. The DVDs do not skip or freeze up like it did in the Mintek Player. There is also a mode button that gets rid of the 2 black bars and puts it full wide screen. This is the only Polaroid Player that comes in black. For the price I'm Satified with this DVD Player."
4,Great player with a good size screen,"I really like this dvd player. The screen is large enough to watch movies in a pretty clear resolution, and you can adjust the picture from FS to WS with the push of a button. For the price, the 30 included games are fun for a while but certainly not varied or exciting in the long run. Overall, you should buy it if you want to watch lots of movies on the go, but you can probably pass on this one if you don't need your movies every second of the day. So, buy it for the movies in the car, but buy a handheld game system for games because the ones included aren't that hot."
4,So far so good,"I bought this unit yesterday after returning the new Toshiba dvd player that was just released (don't recall the model #),due to the fact that it skipped during play and had low volume. This player seems great so far. It has a pretty good picture, a little less sharp than Toshiba, the games are a little outdated, but at least they're there to provide extra entertainment. The sound quality is great. No skipping during play and the swivel feature is great too. It comes with earphones which some units don't do. The price is reasonable for what it delivers."
1,Why not to buy Polaroid products...,"If I could give this product a zero rating I would because the one I received as a birthday gift was defective. But even before I realized that it was defective it was apparent that the swiveling mechanism was of poor quality because it is not possible to lock the screen in the forward position. Once I realized the product was defective I called Polaroid to inquire about an exchange or refund because the retailer from which I purchased it does not exchange electronics that have been opened. Well Polaroid does not exchange or refund its defective products. My only option was to mail them the defective productive, at my own cost, to get repaired and then it would be returned to me approximately 3 weeks later. Essentially I paid $230 for a refurbished product. Its not worth the risk of buying a product from a company that will not even back its own products."
3,Merc W124 manual,"Pictures are not always adequate to illustrate the procedure. Main windshield wiper replacement procedure was not very helpful. diagrams did not show how the parts are removed, and where there are variations in the models, the manual did not cover them either.Other than that the book was helpful. It's a fair enough guide to read and know what the workshops are doing to your ride, but to use it as a workshop manual i'd say there may be better options out there.there was nothing on the A/C system and the center console looked nothing like my 1991 200E. oh well."
2,A Mercedes manual with no vacuum diagrams? Yeesh.,"I bought my wife a 1991 300TE 4MATIC and since I do all the work on my vehicles I looked around for a comprehensive shop manual for the Mercedes W124 chassis. This one seemed to have the best reviews, and Amazon had the best price, so I purchased it. Unfortunately this manual is very general - there are a few good tidbits like testing some of the fuel injection components, but one of the main issues I am having (vacuum-related) is not addressed. In fact, there is not a single vacuum diagram in the entire book that I can find. On our vehicle, a previous owner has capped 2 vacuum lines under the dash and I wanted to reference the line color to a diagram - no such luck. Most likely I will re-sell this manual since it has limited usefulness to me and it is being sold (on that big auction site..) used for $10 more than Amazon sells it for."
5,good book - good read for current and future physicts,I am a female graduate student in physics. There are certain issues the field has not dealt with adequately. Learning the stories of our colleagues is essential to understanding the problems which exist still. I recommend this book to current and future physicists because it will help us understand what was wrong and what is wrong with the field.
1,Inaccurate Data!,"""Idioms for Idiots,"" that's what we call this device. We sold it after several frustrating support calls with the manufacturer, pleading for an update or upgrade. Their contention is that the database is accurate despite examples like, ""Pool your leg"" and ""Black ship of the family"" and numerous mis-translations between Russian and English words. If this is the best they can do, we ask, ""What school of fish did the duraks attend?"" Our advice: they should change professions, like cleaning bathrooms or grooming dogs. The only reason we gave it one star instead of zero is because the case is pretty. Save your money!"
1,Faulty Keyboard,"I found data entry very frustrating because not every key-press is accepted by the system. About 10% of the letters have to be entered twice before they appear on the screen. In addition the tone signal which should signal the successful entry of a letter is not fully reliable.I returned the unit three times to ECTACO in the hope of getting a properly functioning one, without success. Only then did a person at ECTACO admit that this problem was a ""common feature"" of all units of this and some other related series."
1,Don't recommend it,"I purchased this gadget for a trip to Russia, since I don't speak any russian.Overall I think this translator is way overpriced. It has a very cheaplook-and-feel. The LCD screen had a minor defect right from the beginning.The most annoying thing was the keyboard. I usually had to push a buttontwice to get a response. Audio quality is also very poor.Also beware that this thing only has a 10-day return policy. Since my triplasted 2 weeks, I could not return it at the end.I think a cheap paper dictionary would have been better ..."
1,there is no dazz without skip martin singing these songs!!!,the dazz is my group i love the band but skip is the lead singer i don`t know who is singing on here but he`s not going to cut it bring skip back!!!!
2,Great Ambitions Fail To Deliver,"This had the potential to really made a difference in a lot of people's lives, as great rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur teamed up in an ""anti-violent"" album. However, both of their verses are filled with profanities, screaming exactly what the album is trying to change. A huge dissapointment."
5,Very Good Book!,"Both volumes, one and two, are very helpful to analyze horoscope that includes different aspects of effect on house and it's lord.Some real time examples help to understand it better. Need to have both volumes."
5,This book is too cute!,"My 7 mo old son loves to see the little animals pop out, this is a great book for babies!"
1,need more info on product,I am retired an now live in Nicaragua. I needed a camera but they are to expensive here so i decided to order a used one from Amazon. I had it sent to my daughter and she brought it to me when she vacationed here. How is the camera? I have no idea since i can not use it!!! It takes some kind of large memory card that i can not get here. In my reading of the camera i do not remeber any mention of this different kind of card. I am VERY disappointed having a camera i can not use. I would order the card from Amazon but i am not sure if it would work since i have lost all faith in Amazon.
4,A nice digital camera,"Canon PowerShot S50 is a nice little digital camera with 5 megapixel and 3X optical zoom. It has a load of exposure features from fully automatic to fully manual. It takes high quality pictures in JPG or RAW format with normal, fine or superfine resolutions. The only drawback is the focusing being a little slow. It is also sluggish under low light conditions. The rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery doesn't last long (never got it to go longer than 100 shots under normal shooting conditions with the LCD screen on) but can be recharged within an hour. Overall, a nice little camera to have around."
5,GREAT!,"Tried (and by that i mean bought, used, and returned) quite a few cameras before finally deciding on this one. Has the best mix of features and performance of all the ones i tried (Canon G3, Nikon 4300, Nikon 4500, Canon S45). Would definitely recommend this camera, it has great AF (especially with the AF light) and takes amazing photos. Colors a brilliant, and everything is sharp and beautiful. Buy this camera, and also a second battery!"
3,Nice Camera For The Price But...,"Overall, I am satisfied with the quality of the pictures taken outdoors. The landscape shots turned out beautiful. If you want to shoot quick photos, this camera is great for the price.However, there are a few drawbacks with this camera as stated below.1. Sliding Lens Cover Pops Open.2. Too much red-eye in flash photography.3. Pictures look grainy and blurry in low-lighting and in macro shots."
1,Canon S50 has Red Eye Issues,The amount of red eyes in my photos is unbelieveable for a camera in this price range. I am very disappointed. I will probably sell this very soon.
1,I can't get this thing to focus!,"Everyone says that this is a great camera. Now, if only I were able to make out the subject of my photographs it might be something. All I get is blurred, messed up images. This is pretty consistent in any of its autofocus modes. Sure! I see this thing attempting to focus, but it always gets it wrong. I sat here for one hour trying to take a sharp picture of the stuff on my night stand, and was able to do it only on the manual focus mode. Even then, the picture was not that sharp. My old Sony 1 megapixel camera takes far better pictures. Is my camera defective? I Don't know, but I read other reviews that mentioned the same problem. Whatever; I am returning it today."
4,Great camera but door needs improvement,"The camera takes great pictures. It helped me give up some of my ""issues"" with digital versus film. I have yet to print any photos, but they look GREAT on-screen and on-line (my main reason for using digital). Love the quality, love the compact size and the light weight. Good zoom capabilities. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the lens cover. I feel like it could come off each time I open or close the cover (in fact, the one we looked at in the store had it's cover broken -- almost didn't buy it because of that). I compared several different types of digital cameras before purchasing and this one was the best for the price."
4,Digital camera with growing room,"The Canon S50 has lots of strengths: crisp, sharp color, excellent automatic focus and exposure settings, sharp optics and snazzy design. And a few annoying weaknesses; major redeye problems, an optical viewfinder which only shows 82% of the picture, one second shutter delay and a tiny multi-function switch. It's very durable; I dented mine dropping it from an overhead train compartment in Japan. The 32 meg compact flash card included only holds ten pictures at the highest setting but you can buy a 128 meg on the internet for $35. The very compact battery charger charges Canon's proprietary battery in 80 minutes and works on 110/220 volts. You can buy a clone battery on the net for $5.95. I recommend substituting a neck strap for the provided wrist strap. Included software is okay but I like ACDSee better.On balance, an excellent value at Amazon's price. Highly recommended."
2,Nice Camera - Terrible Lens Cover Design,"My experience with this camera has been pleaserable for the most part. However, the lens cover is another story. The lens cover openning and shutting is the key to get the camera operating. After seveal years of use, something happened where the lens cover would no longer shut, making the camera in-operable. I sent it to Cannon for ~$150 service. After getting it back, it worked properly for a few months and then the same thing happened! I'm now in the market for a new camera (I can't keep pouring $$ into this one!)."
4,Canon S50 review,"Very nice camera with a few shortcomings. Very annoying that there is no battery meter, so get a spare battery to keep with you if you plan to be taking lots of photos. The lens cover binds a little and seems flimsy but has held up so far. Be sure to upgrade the capacity with a larger Compact Flash card, the card that comes with the camera has limited space. It takes a while to get used to the shutter action. It can take a full second for shutter to open after the button is pressed, this can play havoc with action shots. In spite of the list above, the quality of images is outstanding. The camera sometimes overexposes images in bright light, but this is easy to compensate for. Overall an excellent camera."
1,Terrible lens cover design,"Is this the best camera that Canon can give for more than $400? Like other Canon Powershot S50, mine broke after 3 years. It seems to be innevitible for this model. If you want something last longer than 3 years, go for other brands. No Canon anymore."
4,Print quality is 100% as good as film,"I was concerned with two things regarding digital cameras: print quality and low light shots. This camera could not have performed any better for either criteria. I have stared at the shots developed on Shutterfly and I honestly cannot tell they're digital. I also tested many different dark shots and it passed with flying colors. The automatic setup picks it up well, but the camera also has a ton of manual overrides in case you want to increase the exposure, etc.Only reason it's not 5 out 5 stars is that I worry that the sliding plastic door will break off before I'm through with the camera, and the software is not as user-friendly as Olympus.Overall, though, I am incredibly pleased with this camera!"
5,Love these kids!!,These kids are awesome!! If only the world really dealt with issues through dance everyone might be happier. Can't wait for season 3!!
3,ok,good book. it taught me the basics and showed some things i had not thought of. would recomend it for the beginner
1,Complete???,Very poor and hardly complete book. Don't buy this one. Very few plans and just a few charts that may be useful. The charts are published in other books with far more information.
4,Just what I wanted,This little book is just exactly what I wanted and that was info on building houses for bluebirds. It's pretty comprehensive for a 46 page book but it's not an encyclopedia.
4,For 3 bucks buy it!,"The title is certainly misleading. It is, by no means, a book on constuction. It is a good reference book on the concept and the design of birdhouses but will leave an inexperienced woodworker reaching for more info. However it is worth the $3.50 - at least it will whet your appetite and give you some idea of what you ae getting into. This book give a lot of thought to the welfare of the bird. It will also help make up enough to get the free shipping."
5,Glad I Read the Reviews,I'm glad I read the reviews and purchased this book. For the price you certainly can't complain you didn't get your bang for the buck! It's written in an easy-to-understand format and loaded with lots of useful information and ideas. If you want to build birdhouses and have a basic understanding of working with wood (and I mean basic like knowing the difference between a nail and a screw) then this is the book for you.
1,Not enough content,Not that many designs. The designs included are limited to birds for certain regions of the USA.
4,Inexpensive book with best table of birdhouse sizees.,"Not very complete as far as types of birdhouses depicted, but it has one of the best and most complete tables listing the interior size and other dimensions needed to construct houses for various species of birds. It also recommends the habitat and height above the ground for locating houses for the various species, and best of all it is cheap. I like it."
3,Worth buying,"This book has a lot of useful information for you to use in making your own blue prints. If you're looking for blue mprints to use to make a bird house, this is not the right book. The information it supplies is the interior size, hole size and shape, hole height and how high the house should be above ground. It also gives some examples on how to hang the bird house you've made. The plans for the included are very generic and don't give much detail.Overall, this is a handy reference guide, but not very good if you need plans."
5,Great Compilation,I bought this CD on a whim a few years ago and it is one of my favorites. It is a great mix of songs and most are by performers either I had never heard of or who I had never listened to. It introduced me to artists whose CD's I now purchase. I like the concept and hope that more CD's are to come. I only know of #1 and (recently now) #2.
1,"Not a quality product, fitment issues",This would have worked great if it fit nicely but it would have taken way too much time to modify to get it looking like a factory option. Ended up just fabricating a mount into the pillar and color matching it with SEM paint. Cleaner look and the same amount of work it would have been just to make this product look acceptable.
1,Is this gameboy advance?,"This game is not gameboy advance. It's not even gameboy. Almost everything went wrong here. Bad graphics, unresponsive controls, and terrible music. It doesn't even seem to have much in common with the movie except that they both have monkeys and they where both bad. Don't even think about buying this."
3,"Its ok, but...","...I didn't really care for it.Here are my reasons:a)the ending is unsatisfying(I know, spelled wrong)b)a little too fast paced, everything is rushed.c)Waite didn't really show me the way of a wallpapers mind, there are a couple of points where she could go further"
4,Halloween Ideas,"This is short but contains good information, especially regarding Halloween. It has 3 different Halloween hunt lists!"
1,Terrible,Very disapointing. No where near worth $12.95 Maybe .25 cents at a yard sale if you happen to come by it. I suppose someone has to pay for the cost of printing it!
5,Excellent for a Home Theater,"Purchased this for a home theater system, creating a 120"" display.Advantages:1. Screen takes up zero space.2. Projector can be placed off center, with adjustments to compensate the angle.3. Bright, even in bulb saving mode.4. Display can be bigger than any plasma screen on the market.5. Costs less than a decent sized plasma screen.6. A very portable television.7. Can connect a PC to view photo collections, internet, etc.8. Works very well on a blank wall (doesn't have to be white).9. Perfect for events at home or away.10. Wow factor!Additional requirements:1. Tuner to watch television (vcr works).2. Audio system for sound.3. Creative setup/placement of cabling and components.4. Large blank wall with adequate distance from projector location.5. Control of ambient lighting.6. Bulb replacement every 3000 hours (equates to over 1000 movies)"
5,Carly's Sound,Carly's Sound was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. It was a fun and romantice novel set in an ideal tropical island. What more could you ask for?! The characters were real people dealing with realistic interpersonal dilemnas and issues. The idealistic setting only added to the romantic fantasy.
5,20 thumbs up,"This is an item that I had purchase for my little bro previously but he used it and then gave it away. He highly recommended it, and now i do. I have already increase my typeing speed three fold, and i have only done for or five lessons."
4,Great Part,"This is a great piece that looks cool. It provided a small increase in torque when put in a car that had previously run a regular K&N filter in the stock housing. If you are stepping up from a paper filter, expect a noticeable increase in torque and horsepower with no real loss in fuel economy."
2,Could Not Get Into It,"There was just nothing about this slow moving romance that could keep me reading. There was nothing terrible about the writing or characterization, but there was nothing compelling to keep me wanting to read."
5,Great part and great seller !!!!!!high quality!!!!!!!!!!!,"Highly recommend this is a nice addition to any vehicle.. Has a great finish and somewhat mirrored, I have had tons of comments and compliments.."
4,A Full Stride Piano at its Best,"Billy Maxted had a long and successful jazz history. Retired in South Florida. where I heard him live in the 1980's, Billy was featured with the Bob Crosby Bobcats, Pee Erwin in New York, and heading his own band. His stride piano reminds one of the late Bob Zurke of the Bobcats, only more at times--a full, two-handed boogie style--but from what I gather,his temperament made him difficult to work with, at times. Although I do not own this LP, I have about five of his albums, including an outstanding Pee Wee Erwin album."
5,One of the best of its' kind,"As a coach of a 5th and 6th grade boys basketball team I found this book a tremendous teaching tool this season. Most of the children I coach have had little or no formal teaching in basketball previous to me. This books true value comes from being geared towards all skill levels. A coach at my level, straight through coaches of High school varsity teams, can find drills to introduce to their players.Every year I've bought a new book on drills because I've never been completly happy with the previous years' purchase. I'm happy to say that next year, and for many more to come, I won't have to buy another."
3,Good enough for beginners...,It describes the basics of basketball but with few exercises for each subject...It's a good book for beginner coaches; want to have a very good knowledge of basketball fundamentals. But this is not a book of basketball drills.
3,Good Product once bit glued into driver,"DS200-s4 Worked well after glueing in the bit. The provided bit locks into the screw gun with a ball bearing and a grove around the bit. After about three screws being driven the bit would pull loose from the driver. I ended up glueing it in with gorillia glue. Contacted Senco and was provided no help. Senco agreed to send me a new bit, but the bit never came. Called Senco again, they provided no additional help. They basically said that this company probably removed the Senco bit and replaced it with a generic bit. Senco's only advise was to bring it to one of their authorized dealer, which is 25 miles from my home in the city of Philadelphia. Thanks Senco."
3,doesn't work long,"This does not work long, but when it was working it performed very well. However I reccomend you pay the extra $$$ and get a higher quality one."
4,car charger,Looks identical to original that lasted 4 years; new products is functioning well and I am pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to purchase again through Amazon or this manufacturer.
4,thoughts,"very pleased with product and shipping time. told phone was out o date and needed to upgrade, thanks to this did not have to"
1,Fell apart first day I used it,This is not even worth the penny I spent on it. It fell apart the first day I used it.
5,Great Insightful Performance,"I have become a big fan of Mr. Zander's. The CD discussions of the symphonies are worth the price alone. He is clearly passionate about the music, as well as what's behind the music, delving into the composers life and perhaps Mahler's perspective. After listening to Zander's discussions and taking in his performance, it is quite interesting to go back to other versions I own and listen to them. Luckily, Mahler's genius is so great, that any well performed interpretation stands on it's own even if you disagree with certain aspects of it. Highly recommended."
3,Some Good Orchestrations,"I purchased this CD primarily for Elmer Bernstein's THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. However, that recording was marginally acceptable. The real gems on this CD are Elmer Bernstein's THE SON OF KATIE ELDER, Tiomkin's ""The Green Leaves Of Summer"" from THE ALAMO and Jerry Fielding's THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES. THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES was quite a surprise. Also of note was 101 Strings rendition of TV's BONANZA. Better recordings of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE COWBOYS and HIGH NOON can be found elsewhere. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was ludicrous. 101 Strings should never have attempted to record it."
5,great,"This is a great documentary series. I did not see the original VHS, and although these DVDs do remind of watching a VHS, it doesn't bother me in the slightest because I am not a videophile. If you like Aurel Stein or are interested in history or geography, then you will find these to be very rewarding and the music sets a nice mood. Definitely check these out."
3,TOO BAD,We have watched the series on VHS--also a very poor transfer but fascinating film. I had hoped the DVD would be a good transfer but sounds as if that is not the case.
5,Unique resource on the Silk Road,"I saw the comments in these reviews about the alleged poor quality video but went ahead and bought the series anyway. Very glad I did. You have to balance whether to focus on the content or cosmetics; I decided on the content, and the production is more than adequate. I have traveled some parts of the Silk Road that are featured in the film and it seemed to me to be a faithful presentation. But having been there, I can personally attest to the challenge of getting to the remote areas, so this film may be as close as you may ever get to seeing them. I can recommend this dvd series to those looking for an in-depth look at the Silk Road in western China."
1,poorly built,"this fan is terrible. I deliver mail and purchased one for my vehicle because my car gets incredibly hot. While I recognize that I run my car for an extended period every day, I am not disappointed with the cooling ability of the fan. I used the fan for about 2 weeks and then out of no where, it started to make a terrible noise. The bolts that held the face to the motor came loose and got cought in the actual fan blades, causing the blades to stop rotating. I thought I solved that problem by screwing back in the bolts, when the motor case on the back came loose and caused the fan to slump on the clip. Then the bolt came loose again, rendering the fan useless. I decided to try to rebuild this fan (which by the way, sells for $10 at walmart) and came to realize that instead of using a screw thread, it used a plastic bolt in the motor case that was completely inaccessible without completely destroying the fan. Don't buy this fan, save your cash and buy yourself a cold drink."
1,Cheap machetes are just that...cheap.,"I would recommend this knife to anyone who wants a cheap, simple, and relatively tough machete for average, like the name says, brush thinning. The machete handles small and medium sized tasks alright, but is definitely not the knife for anyone doing anything other than menial yard-work. For first time knife buyers looking for a garden tool, this knife is also an alright choice.-M"
2,Boring read for the half-interested,"This book contains more useless history and religious education than viable techniques. Even most of the usable information themselves are dumbed down with ancient, irrelevent mystic ambiguoussness.Perhaps this book would be more useful to a person with a keen interest in eastern religious values. To its benefit, it also contains some relevent basic psychiatry, predominantly when it describes how the human mind saves information, as well as the use of symbols.Get [i]The 48 Laws of Power[/i] by Greene, [i]Influence, the pshychology of persuasion[/i] by Robert B. Cialdini and [i]Four Arguments For the Elimination of Television[/i] by Jerry Mander. The information provided in those three tomes are more precise, more in-depth, and more worth your time and money. Don't buy this travesty."
1,Expert?,"Where are his credentials? There's nowhere to find where he got his ""Dr."" title from. As an expert on martial arts and mysterious cults of the east, he quotes shakespeare ecessively. He also references other books by a man named ""Dirk Skinner"". Nice pun. Couldn't find anything about that established author either. The book says its written by Dr. Haha Lung and Christopher Prowant. I challege you to find anything about Prowant as well. Good luck with that."
3,Practice makes Perfect,"It has some pratical technical techniques. But like all things you must practice them daily or this book will be of no use to you. There is a lot of hypnotism in here, if you believe in that I would reccomned it to you, if not then a lot of this book is a waste for you. In a real sense I would suggest another body language/mind control/dark ninja arts type of book to get."
1,Nothing that resembles Ninjutsu,This book seeks to offer a quick ninjutsu solution to the uninformed. If you're looking for REAL ninjutsu(and I do wish to stress REAL) then search out any book written by Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi.
2,Kindle Format TINY,"I bought this in the Kindle format and the text is too small to read (the font cannot be changed).I tried reading it on my computer and it was a little larger. The book is simply the same two pages repeated. One page includes a meeting template (problems/issues to be discussed-new ones and revisiting the ones from previous weeks). The next page is simply lined for notes.Although I like the template, this is a lot to pay for one page of information. I was expecting the book to contain topics for character building discussions as the title indicated."
4,look back on death,"attorney/ P.I. investigates an old murder case.a woman's nephew in prison for her death.eight years later, there is doubt."
3,"It's okay... More Green than Jasmine, Wanted Jasmine","I bought this product for the Jasmine aspect. I was disappointed and I really don't drink it. I ended up finding a nice Gunpowder Jasmine at a local shop and am drinking that instead. I occasionally add some of this to a tea blend, but it really doesn't smell or taste of jasmine like I would have preferred.The tin is nice. Charming...I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Stale - no flavor,"I think I received a very old batch of this stuff, or it's not sealed right in the tin package. I'm betting on the poor packaging. I has no flavor. I'm throwing it away."
4,Very good book!,The book AFTER THE FALL is a very interesting autobiography by a charming and talented performer. It describes how Suzanne Somers became one of the the most famous TV performers in the 70s only to become one of the most unsuccessful TV performers of the 80s. She deserved better than what she got on THREE'S COMPANY. It was especially interesting to read about how Suzanne reacted when she met the actress who replaced her on THREE'S COMPANY. The book is also about how Suzanne and her husband blended their families together. Suzanne's husband was very resentful of her son and it was sad to read about the way Bruce was treated for many years. But in the end everything works out for the best. And I can only hope that one day there will be a THREE'S COMPANY reunion?
3,A BIT Disappointed,"I like Suzanne Somers, but I didn't grasp how she actually got back on her feet AFTER THE FALL, which is what I wanted to know!"
1,I AM SO SORRY!!!,"I really am sorry but this may be the worst western I have ever read. If not it is close. Have read the other reviews and at this time all there gave it a five so I am sure I am wrong but it is the way I feel. Except for about the last 20 or so pages it is so bad, to me anyway. It is so, I really don't know what, I keep thinking of a ""soap"" on television. The characters are not real to me. It is like a melow drama, so much put on, unusual feelings and so much thinking of thing in the past. The ending was also not very good. All in all am glad I bought it used. Sorry!!!!!"
2,Backtrack could have been better,"Backtrack is currently the only First Person Shooter available for the GBA,this means that I have no comparison to others like it. But I can be sure that this is not the limit to this system's capability. First off,the gameplay is just plain boring,since there are very few dirrerent enemies, and the level design barely differs at all. It is also very short, it only has 12 levels where as every other FPS games for the GBA has at least 20. This game also throws you right into gameplay without telling you anything about whats going on. Overall,I'd wait for Doom,Ecks vs Sever,or Dark Arena. But if you can afford it, this game still has it's fun points(though few and far apart)."
2,BackTrack is a good game. Not that bad. Right?,"Can FPSs be pulled off on the GBA with great results? Of course they can, and we have seen exactly a dozen on the small system. Some good (Duke Nukem Advance, Ice Nine), some bad (Wolfenstein 3D, Medal of Honor: Underground). But is the one that started it all any good? Back Track is the tenth best FPS for the GBA and the 1st released for the system. Back Track is a campy sci-fi FPS that limits you to the point where you can see only two feet in front of yourself and lets you man artillery like a bubble gun, yes, you heard me right, a bubble gun, and that's right, you guessed it, it fires bubble gum. What!"
2,Don't buy it.,"This is the first game to show off the GBAs ability to do raytracing style games like Doom, Duke3D, etc.. sadly this one should have never been made. It offers nothing new, graphics are often bad.As of this writing Doom has just been released, get it instead."
5,BackTrack,"I am amazed that a handheld system is capable of this. This game is one of the best games I have ever played. There are 9 levels to get through, then you have to go and backtrack to get out. There is an impressive array of weapons, enemies, and problems to solve. It is like Doom in that you must kill enemies and collect keycards to advance to the next level. If you are considering buying a first person shooter, this is the one."
5,"Comprehensive, easy to read --This book is a gift to women everywhere","I am a child psychiatrist (no longer in training although my review title still refers to me as such), and I work closely with the parents of my patients. I am always looking for books that provide thoughtful accessible guidance for parents. This book is a gem and I will be recommending it often.While the discussion of mood disorders, diagnosis and treatment, pre-conception, during pregnancy, and postpartum is completely comprehensive, this book doesn't just focus on psychiatric diagnoses. It talks openly and wisely about the emotional adjustment required when one becomes a parent. It provides advice on how couples can argue in a fair manner, to preserve connection during stressful times. It explains how different types of psychotherapies may be useful. This book has a great deal to offer. It is very impressive."
4,Very good overall but design and battery is a big problem,Very good overall but design and battery is a big problem.Since Canon does not supply battery charger with the camera you have to pay 20 bucks more.And the camera is very battery consuming.But other features are good enough.It is worth buying it.
3,Size is everything...,"Pros: Photo quality is excellent, and the features are ruling. The movies look good, and I haven't had any technical issues with it. Compact flash is a nice storage medium.Cons: This is a very heavy camera, and the end part is quite big, preventing it from being carried in a pocket (I don't carry a purse).Final thoughts: Excellent for photographing your friends in bars (and making new ones!) Having said that, I would have rather had a smaller camera with the same features for the same price. Maybe a Pentax or the Digital Elph...."
1,"Great Camera, Bad Company","It's a great camera, but hope you never need support. The Canon support structure is bad and nearly non-existent. Very difficult to get to them. I have major problems with my Windows 98SE system and their TWAIN driver and after a week and four or more tries I finally got an email response that said it's a windows problem and they won't help (WON'T not CAN'T). The TWAIN driver doesn't work with my OS and it maybe my old hardware as well as the OS but everything else I try works. It's just their attitude and difficulty getting them to respond. By the way, the camera works okay on Windows XP. Just beware if you have older Hardware or OS - Support is basically not available or helpful and the TWAIN driver may not work or it may hang your system."
5,Excellent Camera - Value for money.,"Excellent Camera - Value for money. Used during my Hawaii trip and was amazed by the output. Not too expensive, but provides most of the features you look for.Bottomline, the quality of the pictures is clear enough for human eye. Not sure, how someone can convince me to buy something more clearer for double the cost."
5,Great Camera and would get it now for a kid in grade school.,"I've had this camera for 6 years and it still works perfectly! However, I gave it to a cousin of mine who is in grade school, because I wanted something with more pixels."
1,Great camera until it died,"I happened to see all of the ""not so good reviews"" on the Canon A70 and thought I needed to send in my bad luck story also. I'm in Iraq right now and my wife was using our camera the other day taking pictures of the kids and it stopped working. After going through all the troubleshooting, she still can't get it to work (won't turn on at all). My initial thought is that it will cost well over $100 to fix and the camera really isn't worth much more than that now. The camera is about two and a half years old and I figured for what I paid for it it should have lasted a lot longer. So, I went from having a great camera to not having one at all. My next thought is my next camera probably won't be a Canon. Sorry Canon, but after all the recent reviews here you might want to look into this."
1,"After 1 year warranty, expected problems occurred to me","I thought I would be the exception from experiencing the Black Screen problem. However, I wasn't. 13 months after I bought it my camera occasionally had blurry purple come up on the LCD screen and that's exactly how the picture looked. I literally bang it against my hand and then the screen comes up clear. However, since I'm past the warranty, I don't feel like getting it repaired. I'm tempted to look into other Canons like the SD400, but I'm reading how that has a LCD cracking problem. If someone has a good suggestion for a $300 digital, I'm all ears."
5,A Devoted Fan,"I've had my PowerShot A70 for about a year and a half and I love love love it! I bought it because I wanted a point and click camera that I could take anywhere. The photographs it produces are so much better than I expected from a camera in this price range. Pictures taken on the automatic settings come out well most of the time, and other options that can be set manually let you take perfect photos in trickier situations. Battery life is also good, and the downloading software that comes with it is easy to use. Highly recommended.My only complaint is that the red eye flash takes really bizarre photos - it looks like the flash goes off twice, so if you're taking a picture with any action in it, you get a sort of double image. But redeye is easily corrected in an image editing program, so I just don't use that feature."
1,Dont buy this,"Nice camera - until it stopped working. The lens mechanism jammed, i got an E18 error and the camera would have cost too much to repair by canon so i've had to spend money twice for a camera: one that doenst work and a new one. Never again"
1,Value for money & Warranty problems,"About eight months after I bought the camera from Amazon USA I have noticed a white spot on all pictures I took with my A70. First I thought it is a piece of dirt on lens so I ignore it. Soon I realized it is a ""dead"" pixel. I contacted Canon USA and they told me to contact a service facility in my country. I called the Canon service in my country and, to my great surprise, they told me I must pay 25$, the cost of repair, which actually implies not changing the sensor but downloading new interpolation data so as to hide the white spot. Since I have already paid the warranty, as embedded cost, I do not understand why I should pay extra money.5 stars for Canon engineers.0 stars for Canon warranty."
2,Falling Apart After Moderate Use,"While the features and ease of use may be good on the A70, the overall quality and durabilty is VERY POOR. My camera developed a fuzzy spot (presumed inside the sealed lens) that appears at the top corner of every photo. A panel on the body also has begun to loosen, even though the camera has always been cased, and never mishandled.In reading other complaints and problems in this forum, it seems that Canon sees users of its consumer cameras as idiots, who will gleefully send these cameras back to the factory and pay a further $150 (plus shipping) for a refurbished replacement.I suggest you purchase a higher-quality brand (Nikon, Leica), and leave Canon to sort out its obvious Quality Control problems on other, less-informed consumers."
2,it's a great digital camera until you have E18 problem!,"Think again and google the internet (canon digital E18 issue) before you buy it. You don¡t want to bet on your luck. Everything is great until you have E18 problem (the lenses jams, google the internet to see how many complains out there!).I had sent my A70 back to the repair facility (in IL) and got it back two days ago, but the problem happened again after about 20 pics taken. Have to send it back to the repair factory again. It's costly when the shipment cost adds up."
1,R.I.P. Canon A70,"Once I got the hang of taking pictures with this camera, I loved it. It took great pictures with amazing quality. A few months back though the camera started blacking out or it would have purple lines. I thought it might be the LCD screen but it wasn't. My pictures were coming out black or with these lines. I would hit it a couple of times and that would do the trick and the pictures would be fine. Now the camera gets hit so hard my hand would start hurting. I gave up and moved on to a Minolta. Apparently Canon cameras, according the negative reviews has this type of problem with their cameras. It's sad because the pictures came out awesome."
2,Poor image quality,"I used this camera to take images in a lab as a record of some work done on a steering mirror system. It's a cheap camera and the image quality reflects it. Matte surfaces had nasty artifacts, even at the 'upper medium' resolution and 'Superfine' quality.Although the camera is easy to handle and quite simple to use, the image quality is everything - and this is a piece of junk in that respect. Any of the Nikon Coolpix series are infinitely superior.Sorry, Canon. You should be able to do better than this."
4,Whoa!,"Really 4.5 stars. The only bad thing is that some of the pictures have looked blurry or soft (but you can just delete them and take them again.)and the LCD screen has looked fuzzy a few times.All the good stuff overshadows that, though. The camera has preformed very well in the inside(bright and dark rooms. Dark are excellent.), outside, and in dark outside scenes. I took 6 pictures the lunar eclipse last night and they are all crystal clear.It powers up very quickly and the menus are easy to navigate. The digital zoom is very useful in far away subjects. There is no delay if you focus first by pushing the 'shoot button' halfway down.I spent 3 months comparing and looking at digital cameras and I finally chose this one. I am extremely pleased. I hope you will choose this one too- you won't be dissapointed!"
4,Excellent choice for the amount of money spent,"At the time this review is written, Powershot A70 is the best digital camera someone can get for this amount of money. After doing some research, by comparing to other digital cameras at the same price, the choice was easy . A70 outstands them all. The image quality is very good for 3.2 mpixels, the manual mode is excellent for such a cheap camera, and it is possible to use extra lenses from Canon. The only problem is the Red eye effect which is quite intense with this camera. This is not very important of course because it can be corrected with the use of software. Another drawback is the use of 4 batteries, where other 3.2 mpixel cameras use 2 batteries. Last but not least the flashcard included is way too small and the purchase of a bigger one is mandatory.In a few words :Pros : good quality, excellent manual mode, excellent video modeCons: Intense redeye, small flashcard, 4 batteries required.I highly recommend this one, it's a great buy."
3,Lack of low light autofocusing...,"Canon is really making a BIG MISTAKE by not improving on its low light autofocus ability. This is another Canon that takes GREAT daytime shots but is incapable of focusing in low light (even with the assist beam). Even my puny Sony U30 can focus in low light, and its only a 2.0 mp (though not a very good resolution). Sometimes it even lies and double beeps that its focused but its not! Don't get this camera (A60/70/80) or most Canons if you take dark indoor or a lot of night shots, they CANNOT FOCUS in low light!The images are also a little soft. They require a bit of sharpening to make them decent to view. Nice that there is enough resolution to make it sharp but you ""have to"" sharpen."
4,Satisfied,"I purchased this camera last week and love it. My wife and I have not stop using it. We take pictures of everything.I read the reviews before I made my decisions and I have to agree with the rest. This is a good camera...Of course I am not a professional but the shots I take are very nice. The quality of the pictures are great! I love the zoom. optical is 3x and then you can zoom in even closer digitally... At close range or far the picture is very clear. no purple problem...The download to our PC was very easy. The use of the camera seems tricky with all the buttons; it's just intimidating; read the manual and after awhile you will be a pro at it.We deffinately recommed this to anyone interested in going digital. I have to agree, the auto lens cover is a nice feature among all the others."
4,Not a bad little camera for the price.,"I've had my A70 for a year now and have not had a problem with it. It takes nice pictures and short movies. There are fancier new cameras out there now (like the A75 or A95), but if you're looking for a bargain the A70 is a good choice. I've always had good experiences with Canon products because they're affordable and user-friendly. Some drawbacks: shutter speed is slow, camera is heavy/bulky, LCD is small. I do not mind the drawbacks, however, and I would recommend this camera for a bargain shopper."
1,Problems after only 2 months,"When this camera works, its great. I've only had it for two months and just received an e18 message. Turns out that Canon cameras are notorious for this e18 message where the lens will get stuck and it stops working. Do a google search with A70 and e18 and you'll see what I mean. I called Canon and was told that there must be something stuck in the lens. I asked whether this was a factory defect and was told that it could be. I now have to send this relatively new camera in for servicing for something that appears to be a known issue to Canon! Can you say class action lawsuit? I will follow up on this review once I get it back. I am keeping my fingers crossed that they will fix whatever defect it came with."
2,I'm tossing mine,It takes nice pictures when it works. Unfortunately it seldom works. Two trips back to Canon is enough. I think Canon has a quality control problem with this as well as their SLRs.
1,DO NOT buy this camera,"It's been three months since i bought my A70. I ran into an ""E18 problem"" where the lens won't retract and the camera won't power up. Turns out it's a common problem with most such cameras and the Web has thousands of complaints about the E18 problem floating around. Make sure you do a search on this problem and find out for yourself. So now I have to ship my camera to Canon wher they will attempt to fix the problem. Too bad Amazon editorial reviews never bothered to do their own research before recommending a completely useless product!"
2,"Maybe mine was a lemon, but...","...out A70's digital pickup elements died after just a year. It would play back fine, just couldn't take pictures. We sent it back twice for fixing until it finally ran out of its warranty. I absolutely loved the features of this camera though, and was sorry to give it up. And, sorry to say, I wouldn't buy another Canon because of this experience."
2,Disappointed,"Just like the other review, my canon powershot A70 became non-functional, just beyond the warranty period. Instead of the picture, it produced orange and black stripes. The Canon Service Center determined it to be a non-functional imaging unit and indicated it would take a minimum of $100 to repair. My options were either to junk the camera and lost $300 investment in it or agree to their demand. I would have expected Canon to repair it for free because the camera was discovered to be non-functional within 13 months of the purchase and at the time of discovery had not been used for over a month. I have reluctantly ponied up $100 for the repair but would warn any one considering a canon powershot to be aware of the reliability problem with their imaging unit."
4,"The ""A"" line cameras are perfect for the point and shoot",I am completely satisfied with the camera. I would recommed you read your manual before you begin taking pictures. I was amazed by some of the features it does have. I also like the fact I can use regular batteries in it. Make sure you invest in a rapid charger and couple of sets of rechargable batteries.It's not perfect taking pictures in low light. I still did receive some red eyes even with red eye reduction light on.I would recommend this camera.
1,Dead after one year.,"Great while it worked, which wasn't long. After 9 months of ownership the camera stopped working, with all the pictures coming out black. Because it was still under warranty Canon repaired at no charge, but the same problem occurred again 3 1/2 months later. No longer under warranty, my only option now is to spend $100+ to fix the exact same problem, which is only guaranteed for another 90 days. Not worth it. I will be spending the $100 towards another camera, and it will definetely NOT be a Canon."
4,good,I received a Used Canon powershot that did not work sent it back. By MY MISTAKE it was returned because I put the wrong address on the package. I returned again with correct address and I was credit immeadately. THANKS Kathy
3,Canon Service Notice,"I have have this Camera for about 3+ years and it was been worked very well for what I wanted it for. Mostly pictures for my website and to print some for shareing with friends.I just recently started having problems with my camera not working all the time because of the screen, but now my lens is stock about half way out and will not right it's self. I did some searching and found that cannon has a service notice on this camera that will repair it even if it is out of warranty. I will be sending my camera in to see if I can get it fixed. To bad to because I just got a new camera for my birthday."
2,A temporary camera,"If you want to spend the money for a great 1-year camera, the Canon PowerShot A70 is the one for you.I agree with all the great reviews of the A70 digital camera. It takes wonderful pictures and is easy to use. I have used the video function numerous times and it works great. When I bought the camera, Consumer Reports recommended this camera.HOWEVER, this camera is apparently designed to ""fail"" between 1 and 2 years of use, depending on how often you use it. After exactly 2 years of use (4,217 pictures), my camera also now gives me the black/purple screen that numerous other consumers have complained about. When the camera decides to be operational, the majority of the pictures now come out blurry. This camera has turned from the best camera I have ever used to an unreliable piece of junk."
2,Everthing is great until you have E18 problem!,"Think again and google the internet (canon digital E18 issue) before you buy it. You don¡t want to bet on your luck. Everything is great until you have E18 problem (the lenses jams, google the internet to see how many complains out there!).I had sent my A70 back to the repair facility (in IL) and got it back two days ago, but the problem happened again after about 20 pics taken. Have to send it back to the repair factory again. It's costly when the shipment cost adds up."
2,disappointed in warranty service,"Bought this camera along with the accessory pack for my daughter as a college graduation present in May 2004.It recently dropped out of her purse into a puddle, it was in its case. It worked initially, then stopped working.The company offers nothing to replace or fix this camera other than she can spend 150.00 to get a refurbished one or she can send it in to be repaired which would cost over 200.00.That seems out of line for a camera which cost 219.00 originally and you can get now for 175.00.They didn't even offer to look at it for no fee and give options for repair or credit for purchase of another canon camera.She was very happy with the performance of this camera and is devistated that all is now lost. I will be hesitant to purchase another canon product."
3,Poor Indoor Autofocusing...,This camera definetly has a problem with indoor autofocusing. While the little red light was shining (focus assist thingy) it still could only focus 2 out of 20 times in my house. I had to return it because 90% of the time thats where I take pictures! I would definetly say to not buy this camera if your an indoor shooter.
1,This product is defective,"I bought my camera about 2 years ago. The camera worked beautiful. I started getting error messages about a year ago. I thought it was the memory card so I continued to use the camera. The problem worsened and the camera would get stuck and wouldn't take pictures. I took my memory card to have pictures developed. The memory card was empty. I lost all my pictures. I went to get a new memory card and took a sample picture. I was able to view the picture and then tried to take a second picture. The camera said memory card error. That's when it was confirmed that this camera is defective. If you want a camera to buy, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. Defects need to be handled. Canon need to give people refund on this camera."
3,Fast camera but not so good picture quality,"As some of the reviews on the web have indicated, the newer Canons have a problem with soft focus, almost to the point that the pictures are out of focus. On the plus side, the camera startup time is very fast and flash cycle time between shots is about 3 seconds (very fast). The camera has numerous manual controls, but lack of picture quality makes this camera less than desireable."
1,Bought 3. All now broken.,I bought three Canon A70s. All are now broken. This camera obviously has some design or quality issue. I am not sure if I can trust Canon now.
3,LCD Screen issues,"My camera is about 3 years old. It is my first digital camera. About 1 year ago the LCD screen began to fade and soon I could no longer see what I was taking a photo of AND when the screen was dark, the photo did not turn out. I would need to turn the camera off/on for it to clear. I called Canon support and like the other person who wrote a review, I was told the the LCD screen was defective and that they would pay for me to send it back to be fixed and return to me at their cost as well. They were very nice about it. About 4 weeks later I had my camera. While I am happy with the photos that it takes, I still have issues with the LCD screen. Every once in awhile the screen will go dark and I need to hit the ""display"" button once or twice before it clears up again. Very annoying. I will need to call Canon service again but I don't know what else can be done. I just had it ""fixed this past summer.W.Kohorst, Silver Spring, MD"
1,Don't buy this camera - won't last you a year!,"I've had the camera just about a year - and a great camera it was for the first year. Then..... Almost to the day, I started getting the E18 Error message (the lens is stuck and won't move in or out - takes 15 minutes every time I turn it on to be able to use it - then it just stops working completely!) So, I checked for reviews on line and, surprise, surprise - HUNDREDS of people are reporting this problem but Canon doesn't seem to be doing anything about it.So, no. I won't be buying another Canon product. Not if this is what they're like. Stay away from this one or you will regret purchasing it."
2,disappointed,"I am regretting buying this camera. I have a Canon scanner which is not compatible with the software for this camera. SO, I am spending several hours trying to set my computer up so I can use EITHER the scanner OR the camera. BEWARE. I can not use both. I have contacted Canon tech support simply to get to this point-there is no software available to fix this glitch.Also, the zoom control is coming loose after shooting about two dozen pictures. And the viewfinder scratches very easily, even if you are VERY careful.This is my first digital camera and I am quite disappointed. It simply is not doing the things I had hoped for."
5,photos from jersey,i want to buy a canon digital camera but having difficultyarrangeing shipment to jersey uk can you help?
1,"Dust, dust and dust. Poor focus, heavy, so so picture","I returned the camera the next day, even I had to lose the gift card of $50.3 pieces of dust on the top of the lens once I opened the package. And one piece of dust under the lens.fuzzy focus. Picture is just so so. The camera is very heavy with the 4 AA batteries.Japanese camera is not as what I thought before. The 1 M kodak I bought 3 years ago takes sharper picture than this one.I would rather buy Samsung Digimax 4500, digimax 3500, Digimax V3 and digimax V4. They also have full manual control. And they are much lighter."
3,camera specs,"Is the Canon Powershot A70 camera pictbridge compatiable,and does it come with a cable to conect to and print pictures directly from my Canon i560s printer?"
4,"Dust, dust and dust","Found 3 pieces of dust on the top of the lens when I opened the package.Then found 1 piece of dust under the lens.Though I could clean the dust on the top, I couldn't clean the dust under.So I returned it to the store, even the camera is fancy."
2,Consider this Review before Purchasing New Models,"I know this camera is old. However, it is similar to the newer models. Don't buy this camera. I bought it quit after 5 years of use with great care in handling it. The reason I bought it was because it took 4, AA batteries. This seemed like a good feature at first with not having to recharge the battery all the time, but it also made the camera have a delay while taking pictures. The delay was long enough for me to miss many great shots. The batteries just aren't strong enough for a fast flash.My next camera will probably be a Pentax Optio M50. It is great for casual shots like when the family gets together. It is also only around $200 at the time of this review. Canon has good cameras, but this series is not one of them, and I give the A70, 2 stars for working 5 years. And all things considered 2 stars is generous."
1,Buy something else!,"We bought our Canon Powershot A70 for a small camera to take on trips, etc. We've already sent it back to the factory twice and although Canon upgraded us to a new camera with more megapixels, this new one is broken, less than 6 months later. Don't waste your money. We will be shopping for a non-Canon product next time."
4,Cannon PowerShot A70,"I had purchased this camera for my job. I like the camers so much that when I changed jobs, I purchased one for my personal use."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,"I have two of these cameras, the A60 and the A70. Each of them worked for about 6 months. Then the screen got all fuzzy and had lines through it, and woukdnt take pictures. After a while it just turned black and stopped working. I sent it in to be fixed under warranty and they fixed it. A few months later it broke again and of course my warranty was up by then.I find it ridiculous that I spent almost $200 on each camera and now all I have to show for it is two broken cameras. I will NEVER buy a Canon again!"
1,Has NO Staying Power,"I based my purchase decision largely on reviews I read on this site. Just about everone was THRILLED with their new camera - so I purchased.I, too, was thrilled - for about 1 year. Then the camera began producing pictures with black lines through them - or red hues. I thought perhaps I got the camera wet - as I also have the underwater housing and take it scuba diving.I surfed the web looking for a repair store in my area - and found many blogs where COUNTLESS people complained of the exact same issues with their PowerShot A70. I contacted Canon, as given sheer number of people who complained, I concluded there must be a design defect. Canon did not stand by their product at all.My conclusion? The camera was not built to last. A good starter digital camera, to be sure. But you should only expect it to work for about 1 year."
1,Quality Problems,"My A70 has quality problems...even after Canon repaired itunder warrantly I continue to have the problems. Whenthe mode switch is flipped to viewing, the camera remains inthe mode to shoot the picture.From reviewing the usenet groups, it appears I am not alone."
1,DO NOT BUY,"My sister and I both have A70's, and in one year, they've started to exhibit the purple-black hazy line problem. Giving the cameras a couple slaps seems to solve the problem at the moment, but it keeps on coming back, and sometimes the slaps don't work. This is a well-documented problem online. it takes great pictures, but the body & doors are rather flimsy, and it's useless once you get the lines problem. too bad."
2,Did I get a lemon?,"I recently got the A70 and immediately like the feel and was impressed with the ease of use and picture quality. However, I am concerned about the construction quality. After taking about 20 or 30 shots, the switch to change between shooting mode and replay mode broke so that I could no longer review pictures that I took (would not switch into review mode). It appears to be still taking pictures, but I'm not sure. Also, the zoom control feels a little loose and the LCD monitor flickers. I'm returning this one and I guess I'll try again."
3,Dying after near 3 years,I bought it in June 2004 and took (only) near 3800 shots. The recent photos have distorted colors. Some experts told me that the CCD is dying.It was a great camera with great pictures. I only wish it could last longer. I hate to buy a DC every 2 or 3 years though it is the trend for consumer electronics.
3,It's OK,"This is an OK entry level digital camera. It's small and well built, not a cheesy piece of junk. When it manages to focus on the subject, it takes pretty decent photos. There lies the rub. The focusing system is worthless. It picks random points within the field of view to focus on and I have not found a way to make it consistantly focus on the center of the frame. The small lens picks up no light, so every indooor shot is a flash photo, which leads to red eye and flash bounce from everything. The time between finger press to shutter release in agonizingly long. Half the time, you'll move the camera thinking something is wrong just as it's releasing the shutter.If you can deal with these problems, then it's not a bad system. I would go the next level higher and get one that you can actually pick what gets focused on.My 2 cents."
1,This Camera Broke My Heart,"I've owned the Canon PowerShot A70 for about 18 months and loved - LOVED! - it. Simple to use, plenty of options for full auto or manual operation, a ton of extras, efficient battery usage, great companion software for easy uploading - all in a compact, attractive, sturdy package. Then the lens retraction mechanism failed and I got the dreaded ""E18"" error message. I emailed Canon's support desk and got a speedy and thorough reply. But since the one year warranty had expired, I was told my only options were that I could send in the camera to its service center (average cost of repair: $100 - $200) or I could pay $150 and they'd send me a factory refurbished A70. Considering the expense, I'll just spend a little more to get a brand new camera. Unless somebody from Canon is monitoring these posts and wants to cut me a deal on repair costs for my beloved but broken PowerShot A70..."
2,Overall quality,"This camera was a good one as long as it lasted. However, we have used it lightly less than two years, and it has stopped working. We've been told that cost to repair these cameras is frequently more than replacement cost. Since we paid over $300 for this camera, I expected it to last longer."
3,I loved (past tense) this camera,"We went everywhere together. I had it for nearly a year and a half when the mechanism that reads the image suddenly went dead. The camera displays photos fine, so it's not the LCD. I didn't drop it or expose it to any extreme elements. I'm disappointed that it lasted less than 1.5 years - but I do have to say that it was a very good 1.5 years.If the camera didn't break so early on, I'd have given it the full five stars."
3,Some good stuff here,"Some folks with a limited attention span may find this book laughable. However, as the parent of a young adult, two teenagers and one adolescent, I found this book to contain invaluable advise many years ago. My children, who have never rebelled, have often sited some of the lessons I learned in that book to being the reason they did so well through their growing up years. The advise to never let your children stomp to their rooms in anger was the most excellent thing I ever learned. Thanks to that book I made my children sit in the same room with me while they cooled off. I reinforced that I loved them and wanted to keep the lines of communication and affection open. They did not have the luxury of plotting in their rooms against me. They often mention this as being the best thing I ever did because we never lost touch with one another, even during the tough times. I learned this through the book. Buy it. Every little bit helps!"
4,Thrilling story!,"I had the privilege of reading this book before it ever got to the publisher, as the author belongs to my circle of friends. But I'm trying not to be biased.DIAMONDS FOR THE DEVIL is a book that will cary you along. The action is so swift that it sometimes keeps you breathless; it's like a film rolling over the screen. There are duels galore, dangers lurking in the dark, but of course there is also a fine love story connected with all of this.One of my favorite scenes is where Marguérite and Lord Newton finally realize that they love each other.I can only advise others to read this enthralling novel as well!"
5,One of the BEST storybooks for children!!!,"I read this book to my sons over 25 yrs. ago when they were little. It has always been one I wanted someday for my grandchildren. The stories are so comforting and wholesome, reinforcing family and innocent fun. The illustrations are unforgettable,which is actually how I found this book again. I've been looking for the book with the boy bunny that helped his mommy for over 10 yrs. I couldn't remember the title, but I DID remember the illustrations. I would HIGHLY recommend this book for all families with little ones."
5,Love this book on beads & threads!,"I'm a big fan of Diane Fitzgerald, and being a knitter and beader, I was intrigued by this out-of-print book. It has some beautiful designs using a loom approach for threads and working in the beads. I don't work with a loom, and doubt that I will start, but it gives me ideas for some things I might do with beads and fibers - through kumihimo or knitting, crocheting or tatting.There are beautiful intricate patterns, and the color photos show off the results - primarily beautiful bib-style necklaces."
4,"A Difficult Read, At First","Wow. My wife and I consider ourselves to be bilingual, however when we tried reading this book to our 9 month old we both stuttered and paused and repeated. I'll have to say that it turned me off a beloved book for about a week. I did return to it and now, after 11 reads, I feel more fluid in my reading that I can start acting out parts. Fun, if you don't quit."
5,Great Book,My students enjoyed this book immensely. We read one page in Spanish followed by a page in English. It worked out great.
3,Mrs. Morris fell into two VERY big traps. .,"1. She allowed her ""christian"" beliefs to shade her perceptions of HUNA.2. She was under the impression that she could use mana to influence others with no consequences to her.What you send out does come back to you, and sometimes it is not pleasant.I can speak to that from personal experience! There was a prayer I saw somewhere that I will paraphrase for you. ""God: make my words and actions sweet and kind so they will not be bitter when I have to eat them later.""She lists MANY anecdotes of people using HUNA to improve their lives.If you are interested in HUNA view my HUNA listmania list This book is good, but there are some books that are much better.

5,Crystal freeze mug,I purchase this for the same co worker that received the lanyard and needless to say he loved it he keeps it at work and shows it off occasionally with a thanks. I was and still am thrilled that this mug was a huge success!
1,Will split within 2-3 months,Bought this couple months ago. It has now split down the middle. Was careful not to put in hot water for cleaning/rinsing. But split anyway. These do not last long.
2,"After only 8 months, one has broken","I ordered two of these in January and one just broke last week--it split right down the side. We've been taking care of it according to the directions. Shoddy product, sadly."
2,"Not enough power for 3"" screws","I have been satisified with SENCO products in the past. I think the DS-200AC screw gun is amazing. Unfortunately it only drives 1""-2"" screws and I needed to drive 1 1/4 and 3"" screws for a project. The DS300AC is really meant for subfloors and is too awkward for drywall, so that left the DS275-18. I was leary of a battery operated system, so I called SENCO and they stated that it could handle 3"" screws without a problem. So I went ahead and bought it.It powers through the 1"" and 2"" screws - not having a cord is very nice. However, on a fresh battery, it could only drive a couple 3"" screws into 2x4's. The drive simply ground to a halt at the end. After the first two screws, it would only drive 2 1/2"" of the 3"" screw consistently. I guess a hint that this tool was never really meant to handle 3"" screws was that the 3"" screws do not fit into the screw guard - the instructions state to remove the screw guard - wish someone at Senco would have told me that."
2,Not for me,"I have a Senco angled finish nailer and I am very satisfied with the durability and reliability of it. This gun, that I was gifted, isn't really my bag. It feels like a mattel toy. It seems to work alright, but it doesn't handle 1 5/8 screws which is industry standard. Plus I have piles of screws at the shop and having to stock the collated screws needed for the gun just isn't worth it. Especially since you have to learn how to use the mechanism that feeds and screws the fasteners in. It just isn't worth my time. I imagine if you are one of those carpenters that are on a crew that tapes their screw gun triggers down and punch hundreds of screws in an hour maybe it is for you, but we are not a high octane type of outfit."
3,"Not bad, but not great, either","""Elvenblood"" falls prey to several major problems with sequels: it's significantly shorter, less complex, more limited, and less careful than its predecessor. The plot is not as tightly constructed; the characters are not as well-developed. And it's full of glaring continuity errors. Didn't anybody read the series through to check facts?But it's fun enough to read. I'll buy the third book."
5,This book is incredible!,The book starts out with Lashana helping the wizards find a new home. It progresses with them buliding a home deep in a cave. Meanwhile the book is telling you about how an elven girl grows up and eventualy becomes a wizard. At the end of the story the elves are overthrown but the authors leave the story open (hopefully this means that the authors are going to write another book!) so that the elves are not completly destroyed
2,don't get your hopes up,"Well, I really hate to say anything bad about one of my favorite authors, but this book really is a disappointment. It'd be ok I suppose if ""The Elvenbane"" didn't come before it. But with such an amazing prior book, it just doesn't measure up! After reading Elvenbane, I looked forward to the next book for a real long time, but when Elvenblood finally came out, it really disappointed. The book is too bland, not much excitement, action, not much of a plot at all to tell the truth. It just can't move you like the first book did. And one more thing I can't stand is how the characters paired up in the end. To think that such a nice boy would end up with such a disgustingly depressing wimp of an elven girl."
1,Unrealistic,"I understand that this book tries to reflect real teenager's feelings and that the ending is considered realistic, but I found Shadow People depressing. Four teenagers - Lydia, Hollis, Alec, and Gabe - start a group called Shadow People, where they plan to go out and release their fury on the unsuspecting town. I don't believe that the feelings and actions of the characters are accurate reflections of teenagers. Sure, we all get angry, but most of us do not blow up buildings because of it. When I read this book I was looking for an intriguing thriller, but the book is neither interesting or suspenseful. I wouldn't waste your time on it."
4,Kev's Review,"This book was easy to read and it was very intriguing. I found it easy to relate to. I didn't really like the ending. it seemed like the plot was going somewhere, and all the sudden they were on trial and the book was done."
1,Beware of offensive language,"When Gabriel's family moves to a secluded area in western New Jersey, after his brother is murdered, Gabriel finds himself involved with three other teenagers in a series of increasingly violent acts. Each teenager has his or her own problems. Hollis is the leader and instigator of the most serious acts, and forces the others to remain involved in the group, or else.This book should be for mature readers only because of the mature subject matter and the offensive language."
5,Great and easy!,"I bought this almanc for my son, who refers to it all the time now, not just for book reports and such, but also to look up all kinds of everyday information based on what he sees on TV, in books, and in school. His teacher recommended it to me because they get TIME for Kids in class [....] I use it also! It's really easy to find fast information on just about everything. And it's really graphically appealing with great design and photography! It's awesome -- the best I've ever seen for kids."
1,Dont buy it if you want it to work with a Phone,The seller sent the order right away and it arrived quickly. It did not come with product drivers. It was purchased to transfer files from a cell phone to a laptop. It does not work for that. I have searched the internet but I have had no luck in finding drivers that will work for the purpose that I purchased this bluetooth adapter.
3,Still Trying to Make it Work,"The price was right, but I'm starting to think I'd have been better off just buying a more expensive one. The drivers on the CD that came with it didn't work with Vista, and the included Vista drivers kept calling it a generic ""Motorola Bluetooth Device"". That did not let it work with the PC. It took several hours of Google searching to find out that you have to manually set the drivers as ""Blutonium BCM2035"" to make it work. Even after all that, I'm still having problems getting it to connect to any of our cell phones. Seems like I'm half way to making this thing work, but I'm losing patience really fast!"
1,Broke during installation,"The plastic top plate broke completely off and the lower clamp assembly fell down into the stake pocket on my 2006 GMS Sierra when I was tightening the screws. I used a screwdriver with what I thought was normal force, not a power drill.They looked like they would have worked ok if they'd not broken during installation, though. I ended up ordering a version of these that has metal-to-metal contact at the installation point instead of plastic-to-metal."
1,Too short small for 2011-12 Chevy/GM - buy Bull Ring instead,"I bought these for use on a 2011 Chevrolet truck and the anchors are too narrow and too short for the stake pockets (1.75"" x 2.75"") on the side rails of my truck by at least 1/2"" in each dimension.I returned them to Amazon and had to pay a $6 return fee even though the item was not right for my vehicle.I went to another vendor and found the Bull Ring truck anchor points part number 4003ss for the 2011-2012 Chevy/GM trucks. When they arrived it was clear that they were stronger than the Highland Bull Ring and had an extra plate to latch into the stake pocket and provide a solid connection."
5,"Perfect, simple, quality, sturdy","The title says it all. Easy to install, works great. Coudln't ask for anything better. Installed easily on my 2012 chevy silverado crew cab standard bed xl texas edition."
4,Little expensive but work as advertised,Bought total of four for 2010 Chevy Silverado HD with a linex bedliner. These installed easily with no problems. Stay up when you want them to and no rattle that I have noticed when they are down. Have used these to secure loads with no issues. Would buy again.
2,Size of rings,"These seem ok. Size of ring seems a little small to accomodate a large hook which would be on a 2"" ratchet strap."
3,"Good, but...","Here are the pros and cons as I see it:Pro: This is pretty comfy to wear on my bicep. Mind you, I'm pretty skinny. If you have muscles like Ahnold used to, you may want to try it out in person before you buy.Pro: You can see the Pod through the shield.Con: While I can see the Pod, I can't really read the Pod through the shield - particularly outside in sunlight.Con: It's not an adjustable band, so if you have large arms it may not be so comfy for you.Con: Using it with the Nike sport kit is kind of a mixed bag. The band has to stretch a lot to fit over the plug in the bottom of the Pod, and once it's stretched over that, it doesn't snap back so well. To the extent that it doesn't hold the Pod in place nicely without the plug."
5,David Pack-Incredible Singer/Songwirter,"I have always loved David Packs voice and songwriting and this release is no acception. The new songs have some great melody lines and lyrics along with some cool guest appearances by Steve Perry and Timothy B Schmidt on backing vocals. The new versions of the classic Ambrosia songs "" Your The Only Woman "" and ""The Biggest Part Of ME "" have just enough of a rhythm change to make them fresh and new. I'm not saying they needed something new but these versions make them new again.This is a CD that you put in and listen to the whole thing all the way through."
4,"David Pack, a true artist!","This is one of the best albums I have bought in years! Unique songwriting, unique musicianship, and a unique combination of vocalists! David Pack's soothing voice combined with some of the finest singers in the world makes this an album well worth the money, and well worth listening to, over and over again. I'll be waiting for the next one!"
5,An Amazing Collection of Music!,"David Pack has come up to the plate and hit a home run! His arrangements and singing are as great as he's ever written or produced. The guest appearances are very apparent but not overdone and it is obvious there is a lot of respect by the industry or there would not be this much support by top notch music industry people.His remakes of the hits he made with Ambrosia are wonderful and the new songs are well written and expertly produced. I don't write reviews often and this particular CD is well worth anyones consideration. Put it on, relax and enjoy!"
1,worst cuppa soup ever,I love miso soup but this was so baaad. It smells like my grandma's henhouse...like chickens and old hay. It tastes very bland and watery.
4,interesting,I find the book very interesting. It is one that I have a hard time putting down. Jackson just wants his life back and some people are making it difficult for him to do that.He is wounded an you just want to wrap your arms around him and tell him things will be okay.
5,Dinah McCall aka Sharon Sala's Best Creation By Far,"I am a huge Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall fan and through the years that I have discovered her books and writing style, it always uplifts and inspires. This book encompasses both, life is tough as it is, but with this book, Jackson Rule, one can be hopeful; we all go through patches of darkeness in life but there is that light that we can look forward to at the end.I just hope Ms. Sala would be able to bring back all the emotion and inspiration she gave into this tremendously wonderful book in her future offerings."
2,DNF,"This was given rave reviews somewhere, but I found it unrealistic and boring. I kept at it for a while, hoping it would turn around, but no such luck."
3,"Bringing the Bible to the masses, but then what?","Despite the fact that Ryken seems more theologically conservative than I find tasteful, this book does a good job of making the Bible accessible to the average reader as a matter more of Western culture than Christian faith. The author's emphasis on literature underscores that the importance of the Bible lies in its ability to communicate by evoking an emotional experience in the reader.However, as a product of Western literature, there are a few important points Ryken skips over: How can the Biblical stories clearly intended in the Bible as morality tales not become trite and manipulative to postmodern Western audiences? Does the use of metaphor in the Bible invite differing interpretations because each reader will have a different experience of the original metaphor? And perhaps, due to Ryken's Wheaton-based theology, he entirely fails to address overiding themes in the Bible such as the condemnation of hubris and exclusivity."
3,Missing Pages,"Purchased this book for a literature class. Unfortunately, when I reached a certain page, about 20 pages were missing from the reading."
4,The Bible as Literature,"Leland Ryken is excellent in pointing out nuances of the Bible that most people have never even seen (such as satire, tragedy and parables). It gave me a fresh perspective on the Bible because even though the Bible is inspired, it was still written by competent men of God (I guess people 2500 years ago aren't as dumb as we were taught they were). This book helps to interpret even more accurately, and helps you identify the genres withing a book of the Bible. I believe this is a condensed version of another larger, more in depth book of his, but I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about biblical literature and what's in the pages of the Bible. Pastors and congregations across America would benefit from owning a copy of this book on their shelf."
2,"Decent pump, but not universal","So I bought this to use with my 750ml Torani syrup because the description states it's a universal fit for these bottles. However, the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. I ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. The price was cheap so I didn't feel like returning it."
5,Great Quality!,"I purchased this one and according to its price I thought it would be low-quality product. I was wrong! it is high-quality product and installs easily, beside its flawless movement."
4,ear candy and sing in the sunshine,"I have wanted these two cds for a long time and finally they are here. I purchased both back at the time of release in the 70s, and like both very much. Listening to ear candy today- i feel it the stronger of the two releases. Song selection is superior and better array of sound. I felt then and still do the song baby im a star is just awful and a total ego driven song on helen part (sometimes a record comp has to say no) Sing in the sunshine is a nice collection of songs and just a little bit a disco here and there-my feeling is there was just not a great stand out song on the record, but still enjoy listening to the cd. Helen reddy was one of my favorite singer when these records were released and she hold up well even after 30 years, and i think that sums up pretty well for her and the listener."
2,Another poorly made movie.,"If you want to see a good horror movie, rent one that was released in the theaters. This was a waste of time. If you want to support an independent film maker, go for it."
1,Don't waste your money,There is nothing on here you cannot get off of YouTube. THis was a waste of money.The last part is nothing more that a rolling screen (ala Star Wars) of a Biography that is common knowledge.Nothing new here.
1,DON.T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU..!!,"I most certainly have to agree with the last reviewer of this pathetic piece of junk. PLEASE..DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PURCHASE OF THIS ITEM !! Out of all of the other much better Amy Winehouse video / documentaries of such a great artist, this is absolutely appalling..no if's and's or but's..hands down the worst. As stated, nothing that you cannot view on Youtube. The producers of this should be made to take it off the shelves for sale and compensate all the buyers of this disc. Better still, they should be made to donate all of the profits made from this to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. R. I . P. Amy, you will be missed by millions and remembered to future generations."
4,Why Should You Read This Book? To Have Fun Learning!,"Lila Prap's ""Why?"" is a scientifically sound question and answer book disguised as a silly riddle book. Each two page spread features an animal, a question, and several possible answers. ""Why do kangaroos have pouches?"" One ludicrous answer is ""To hide their bellybuttons."" The correct answer is marked with a star, always found on the far right of the page. The rest of the ridiculous answers follow kid logic and some adult logic, especially those adults driven quite mad by a little one's unending ""Why?"" questions. While the illustrations and short text are well-suited to preschoolers, older children will also fully enjoy the book's information and humor. A nice introductory book to the mysteries of the animal kingdom for ages 4+.Recommended."
4,"Great detail detective work, but...","This is a great resource for historical artifacts that don't fit the usual history of America, but the conclusions are very speculative. The bookNoah's Ark, Discovering the Science of Man's Oldest Mysteryoffers a more plausible explanation with facts that support the theory."
4,2009 Corolla,"Used this on my 2009 Corolla. It fit the cutout in the S/XRS bumper almost perfectly. Love the way it looks, just wish it was bit less expensive."
2,Where's the rest of the book?,"While I have enjoyed many of Sun's books, this one is simply inadequate. The organization of topics was mediocre, but, in my opinion, the book is a disappointment because of its sheer lack of depth (just 300 pages). What few examples that were provided are typically discussed in two or three sentence paragraphs, often leaving out several key concepts contained in the example. In addition, many more subtle patterns/topics seem to be left as an excerise for the reader. Unfortunately, this probably _is_ the most complete JNI book to date."
4,In depth coverage,"While new JVMs are reducing the need for JNI (speed is getting better), there are some specialty things that are not documented well anywhere else. This book is well written and concise."
1,Didn't find it useful,"We tried to use this book for our Java/JNI development effort. It seemed like a good resource at first, but fell apart when we tried to write JNI code based on the book's examples. The examples were full of bugs and almost never worked. Time and time again we had to go back to the JNI chapter in Sun's Java tutorial. As limited as the online Sun JNI tutorial was, it was much more useful than this book."
5,"Concise, Complete, and Definitive","I was not looking forward to learning and using JNI, but found myself in a position where that was in fact what I had to do. Of the three books I purchased on the subject, this is the one I keep going back for the information I need. It provides a high level discussion with just enough code snippets to turning what you learn into real code. This is the one I'll keep on my shelf."
4,"Worth it, but i've seen better","I'd suggest this to more die hard fans of Batman/Joker, but not as much as a lot of other Batman/Joker comics out there. It was still fun, well written, well drawn, and didn't rely on shock alone as much as some comics do. In a way it makes fun of those who do."
3,OK for home projects,I built my own garage foundation and used this tool. Saved big money by not hiring a contractor. The tool is made in China but it never failed.
2,disappointed,according to the info card on the pot... the brackets to hang the pot are included...but I did not receive the brackets. I emailed the company and they have not responded.
2,does the job,"This product is fine. The railing holders of a number of years ago were far more sturdy. The main issue with this one is that I had to use the long side of the grippers, which then caused them to move into the area where the pot is. So they do the job, but the design just isn't very thoughtful."
5,Adjustable flower pot holder,"I purchased three of these a couple of years ago, but unfortunately the place I purchased them from no longer carried them. So I went on-line and found them! What a surprise they are identical to the ones purchased years ago. I am very pleased with the quality of this product."
5,Western Romance is Fun,A good modern western is hard to find but Ms. Christenberry can turn them out in style. I search for hers on Amazon when I want a good read.
4,(Really 3 & 1/2 stars)...Fun music,"I recently happened upon a copy of this disc and just popped it in, not expecting to be too impressed. And I wasn't. It was just another albu by another struggling New York singer/songwriter. The next night I gave it another listen, as some of the melodies had stuck with me and I found it getting more and more rotations in my stereo. The title track (""Last Time I Did Acid"") is infectious. It's simple riff gives way to great, down-to-earth lyrics that make you feel like you were there. ""Seattle"" is a great little tune as well. These songs aren't particularly well-written or well-performed, but they stick with you. They make you want to listen again. I recommend this for anyone who likes a little originality in their music collection, and I would highly advise watching out for future releases from J-Lew. Time either breeds selling out or excellence, and I don't think we have to worry about the former from this guy."
5,Excellent buy 4 the price,Camera was a great buy for the price. Excellent pictures and easy to use. Would definitly recommend to a friend. Does not come with removable memory card.
5,No Hurt in My Pain,Dad i love your story i did not read i just reed the summary thet was given.!:)D'Ayre
4,A Decent Read,"If you are looking for a good book with information on poisons for your game....it's worth the buy. The description said ""hardback"" when i bought it....but its a paperback book. Otherwise though, the ""prestige classes"" are abit too powerful in my own opinion....but the materials you can take for this book will definitely aide in good character building and has some useful ideas for a neutral alignment or evil alignment characters. The poison tables are useful and will give you good ideas for values (monitary), creation and application of such poisons. Overall, i am very happy with the book. A useful tool to anyones library for supplemental information."
2,Not as good as the first time,"The premise of this sequel was set up very well in ""First Comes Love."" The widower and kidnap victim, both survivors and in need of love. Seems like a great set up but I was very dissappointed with the actual story and character development.First of all what I fell in love with in ""First Comes Love"" was the characters interaction with the town AND each other. In this sequel there was more dialogue in the minds of the characters than each other and the town characters. I found that the author could have done a better job in letting Honor's light shine with the town.I did not like the secondary story. It was very contrived and not at all as good as the secondary story in ""First Comes Love.""Although I liked Honor and her need to optimistic at the end of the book she seemed to be very selfish by inviting all those people to Bram's home especially when there was a true risk to her and his safety. It seemed her need to belong outshadowed him."
2,A strange approach...,"This is an odd book, written as part open letter to the late Michael Jackson and part history of the life and career of Jackson and the other members of the Jackson family, up until the mid-80s. Interestingly, there is a fair amount of judgement and insinuation going on here (and this was before Michael's life got completely out of control), so it is far from an objective journalistic book. The author seems to be primarily annoyed at MJ's unwillingness (in his opinion) to take risks and expose himself emotionally, either in his music or his personal life, but the writer's smug condescension makes it difficult to take his critique seriously."
1,Tabloid in Disguise,"This is the sort of material that WAS the pile-on Michael Jackson, while pretending to be about analyzing the pile-on. We get the usual garbage written by an amateur armchair psychoanalyst, who never met--much less interviewed--Jackson or any credible source such as his longterm associates, friends, and family. Therefore, the entire thing is a fiction of the worst kind that is now eschewed by a public that wants something very simple, really: a fair, balanced, knowledgeable, and insightful account of the life of the foremost creative genius of American popular culture. Not more sensationalist tripe written for a fast buck while the going was good.It is tragicomic that this lame effort purports to have once been recommended as library material. What a joke!"
4,"Insightful look at Jackson, black pop and celebrity.","Music critic Dave Marsh (of ""Rap Confidential"") looks at the life of Michael Jackson up to the end of his disasterous ""Victory Tour."" Between a series of open letters to Jackson, he looks at his history, as well as the history of contemporary black music and the responsibilities a black artist has to his audiences. Although heavily opinionated, the book's viewpoint is valuable - and compassionate to Jackson, even though it disagrees with him."
1,decent,"This book is decent, although others are better. I would recommend a read if you are a Jackson fan."
3,"A FLAWED, BUT GOOD BOOK ON WACKO JACKO.......","At times, Dave Marsh succumbs to overt hyperbole (who the hell cares whether Jackson loves Bugs Bunny cartoons?) and white ""progressive"" racist arrogance (Yo, Dave, if ""black people carry a burden in America, Michael""---ain't that caused by white racism?). Still, by and large, it serves as a good book on M.J. up to THRILLER (I wish he'd update it for the 90's), and it functions nicely as ironic commentary on his own newsletter (ROCK & RAP CONFIDENTIAL)'s runaway, naive intergrationist/communitarian rhetoric."
5,Essential if you loved 2001,"I highly reccommend this book to you if you enjoyed the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (or the movie, for that matter, but read the book version of it before you read this.) It consists of chapters that were originally written for the book, but were not used. Also included are occasional musings by Clarke on the making of the book, and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the making of the movie. He kept a journal during the entire 4-year process of the making of the works, and some of them are excerpted here. It's interesting to see some of the ideas that were thought up, but abandoned. For instance, what became HAL was originally a walking robot; the initial ""Dawn of Man"" scenes involved an actual alien, and there are numerous alternate endings (all of them every bit as ornate as the one we're all familar with.) This is sort of the literary equivalent of the movie industry's ""The Making of Kubrick's 2001"" (which I also reccommend.) A highly worthy buy for the fan."
3,"insightful look by the author into the movie ""2001...""","In this approoximately 200-page paperback you can find interesting details about the making of the movie, and learn about the people behind the ideas presented in ""2001."" Clarke supplies many interesting anecdotes of the making of the movie, and fills-in the reader on what the origin of some of the ideas and technologies presented in the film. For example, ""HAL"" was a 'real' acronym (meaning Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer), rather than a one-upsmanship game with IBM (the letters HAL are correspondingly 1 letter ahead of IBM, and many people asked Clarke about that). The historical perspective is interesting, too, since the Apollo Project and 2001 were happening at the same time--Kubrick and Clarke did not want to lose cinematic credibility to events in the so-called ""space race."""
4,"Much better than the ""modified for the movie"" 2001.","This is the original version of what most people know as ""2001: A space odyssey"". The differences are small, but they help make sense out of the cropped version of the story sci fi fans are famillier with."
4,If You Want Your Children to be Socially Successful,"A comprehensive book on the subject. It covers topics like early friendships; the nature of friends; the skill to make friends; the loosing of friends; between boys, between girls and between groups; making friends of different ages etc.A very good definition of friendship and its nature and how it is different and yet connected with love or even wedlock. There are other things parents should look into (e.g. moving houses, changing schools...) if they want their children to be socially or indeed personally successful.This book basically draws our attention to the relavant problems, giving us the basic principles involved without too much analysis or practical advice. The book is easy to read and full of examples. A very informative and engaging book that would take you half a day to finish. Recommended."
2,a dark mystery,this story had me turning pages just to find out where the twists and turns would finally lead. i wanted to know what actually happened to the innocent nine year old who was sent off down town on her own to drop off overdue library books. perhaps i stuck with the book because my copy was in large print and it seemed to read fast. katie mackey's parents were irresponsible people. mr. dees and mr. wright were two very disturbed men. the book left me feeling sick to my stomach... the same sick i felt after i watched the movie IN THE BEDROOM. yuck!
2,The Bright Forever,I am not into books that are about children being hurt or this kind of family trajedy. I did not dislike the book and I did finish it. There was a suspense that made you want to know what happened that kept me reading. It was a little too scary for me as a parent.
1,Deserves No Stars,"This has to be one the most boring books I have ever read. I cannot believe this was published. The characters just rambled on forever about nothing. The only reason I finished this books is because I paid for this dreary piece of garbage. The sad part is when the child is the best character in the book, this book was a pathetic piece of babbling junk."
5,Keeps the reader guessing!,"It kept me interested from the start. I think it may have taken me just three days to read it, which is not a long time, considering I had to work some of the days and take care of my kids all of the days. I spent most of the wee hours last night reading it.This book isn't for everyone. It's a bit disturbing...so keep that in mind. Similar to Lovely Bones, it's about a girl who goes missing and the days that follow. In The Bright Forever, it really is just the few days that follow and is from several points of view. It really kept me guessing for awhile...which I loved. :)"
4,Dark Story with Weirdly Positive Title,"The forever for the characters in this book is the opposite of bright. A gripping story, told from differing perspectives, of a parent's worst nightmare. A very well written and executed novel, all of the characters are guilty of something pretty insidious. It was tough to put it down, but also gave me the creeps."
4,Where is Katie?,"The whole time I couldn't figure out who really did it. Here we have two characters, one who is a pervert and the other is a druggie. Neither one can tell the truth to save their lives and they get deeper and deeper in with their lives.All the parents want to know is, WHERE IS KATIE? This story ends with the truth. Will you be satisfied with the truth? A haunting read about something that is all too commonplace in our society today. A wonderful, spellbinding read none the less."
2,Is that all there is?,"I agree with some of the other reviews here. Beautiful writing, nicely drawn characters, but I feel the ending just didn't add up for me. In fact it angered me. I feel like the author wasted my time."
2,A disappointment,"I had heard that this book was similar to LOVELY BONES and I really thought that book was well written. This one was a disappointment. The characters were boringly pitiful. The main character, Katie was not fully developed. I was disappointed."
2,Just going back and forth a bit much,I really wanted to read this novel. But the book kept going back and forth just way to much for my liking. Trying to keep up with this book was just hard for me.It wasn't what I was expecting.
3,Not what I expected,I felt like I spent the entire book waiting for the big twist only to come up empty. It was just okay...
4,Well crafted and poignant,"I think that it's a little unfair that this book is being compared to Mystic River. No, this is not an original story, but it is told in an original way by a very talented writer. The story held my interest from beginning to end; I wanted to read more, to find out more about the characters. I felt their pain as if they were sitting next to me telling their part of the story. I was particularly moved by Clare Wright's speech to Gilley at the end of the novel. I felt she had to to something to give voice to the pain she was feeling as well. This book was unnerving at times, but very, very good and I will recommend it."
4,Reccommended for lovers of mysteries and human nature.,Lee Martin's The Bright Forever unravels the mystery of a young girl's disappearance on a quiet summer evening. Martin's characterization and alternating perspectives makes this an engrossing read. Henry Dees one of the principle characters is tough to forget and hard not to understand and even love despite his story. Fan's of the Lovely Bones will find this a winner.
4,Pretty good.....as a Whodunnit!,"This book kept me compelled due to the mystery lover in me. Although the subject matter is tragic, you just wanted to know what happened to Katie! I have to say this book seemed more of a thriller than anything to me, I was constantly wondering who did it?? Who was lying?? Who was hiding something?? I actually got scared thinking there are peoeple like Mr. Dees and Ray in this world. I felt there were some loose ends at the end of the book, but, this book is good for a rainy day and it's a quick read. However, I do feel the author could have gone the extra length and really strengthened this book."
3,Really disappointing,"After being highly touted in both the Doubleday Book Club brochure and in other reviews, I was looking forward to reading THE BRIGHT FOREVER, but I was extremely disappointed. I thought the book was well-written--there's where I disagree with some other reviews here and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 or 1--but the characters left me cold. When I read a book, I have to have someone to root for, and there was no one in this book I cared enough about except the poor victim, and I knew up front there would be no happy ending for her. There wasn't even the promise of something good coming out of the tragedy depicted, and there was certainly no sigh of satisfaction when I finished. This is a dark, depressing, and dismal story with main characters that are sad, pathetic people. I probably would not buy another book by this author."
5,All purpose bowl,"I like Denby stoneware finishes. No scratches from forks and knives, easy to clean and very durable.This is my go to bowl for serving, salad, pasta, stews, and soups.Recommended for everyday use micro, oven and dishwasher safe."
5,No Sparkle - All Bite!,"Candle Bay by Tamara Thorne is a return to the vampires of old - you know, before they sparkled. These are old school vampires - scary and edgy!Thorne has a real gift for characterization - her characters live and breathe on the page (or Kindle in my case). Her vampires are scary sexy - not in an Anne Rice Lestat sort of way - but in a much more horrifying way.This is a fast read with impeccable plotting and gruesome delights. Not for the faint of heart, but fabulous entertainment if you want a good scare.Will I read her again? I've downloaded half a dozen more samples of her books and I'll be making my way through all of them.Simply a great read!"
5,"More, More, More!","If you mixed a cocktail of bold horror, laced it with razor-sharp dialogue, sprinkled in some fresh characters, added a good dose of shrewd humor and a dash of heady sexiness, you'd have Candle Bay. This novel combines breathtaking beauty with breathtaking terror in a way only Tamara Thorne can deliver. With Candle Bay, Tamara Thorne isn't just on top of her game, she's on all four sides of it, and in a market saturated with feel-good vampire cuteness, she ups the anty by returning these beasts to their rightful place as creatures of mystery and maturity. The only thing wrong with this book is that there isn't more of it. I'd love to see a sequel to this one. Tamara Thorne is a master storyteller and Candle Bay is her proof. 5 stars!"
2,Very disappointing,"Wow ... was an incredible disappointment. After reading the other reviewers' glowing comments I was excited to begin this 'riveting' novel. Too much dialogue, barely fleshed-out characters (especially Stephen) and not much personal investment in the heroine. There are SO many other vampire-based novels I found more entertaining (Laurell K. Hamilton series, Katie Macalester, and more). This definitely won't hit my ""keeper"" shelf."
2,so disappointed,"This was one mixed up, scrambled, messed up, too many things going on at the same time, book. It had no closure. Perhaps there is supposed to be a sequel? I sure hope not!!!!!!"
4,Rock Solid Case,"I love this case. I am confident my notebook is safe while traveling in this case. Downside is it is heavy but expected from a hard case. Quality is number one in my book. Stainless hardware, locking hasps, styled shoulder strap. One complaint is the insert has fallen out of mine. The insert is attached with double sided taped velcro. I think the heat and humidity where I live caused the adhesive to become tacky and lose its stick. The seams of the inserts which appear to be glued are seperating too. Nonetheless, Pelican is taking care of me and their tech support is OUTSTANDING!"
5,Tough,"Here is my take on the Pelican case.When we arrived in Mazar e Sharif via C17, we had to unload the aircraft. While doing so, my Pelican case, containing my laptop, fell from the loading ramp of the aircraft. If you know the value of a computer while downrange, you know how scared I was that it was over. I thought for sure I would need another computer to keep me entertained while I had downtime. With no way to replace it at the time, I was truly scared the machine would not work once we got to our ultimate destination out in the wood at a COP (Combat Out-post).Well the story goes, no damage to any of the contents and everything was safe and sound. A fall from 8 feet or so, and it was safe!"
4,"Solid indoor broom, even if a little pricey.","I was looking for a well-constructed heavy duty push broom that would handle a variety of household and garage tasks. There are plenty of small, fragile, cheap push brooms out there and I wanted to avoid getting stuck with one of those.This broom has performed well so far and has a solid ""hand-feel"". I've put it through its paces - especially in the garage - and would probably buy another one. It'll handle dust, dirt, litter, and small garage debris with ease.I have any complaint, it's only that I feel the price is a bit steep. That said, I'd rather pay a little more for a lot better quality and I feel this was a good investment."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air to music,I came across this cd quite by accident during a search on the net and having listened to it fully It was well worth the money. I Dont know how long Glen has been on the music scene but this cd particularly the title song So this Is Love is full of beautiful songs and singing that is easy on the ears with excellent backings in an age where real singing doesnt seem to count any more this stands at the top of the pile for those of us with good old fashioned values of what is a good song done with feeling that reaches out to your soul.Maybe i will be lucky enough to see the guy on tour one day he is certainly worth listening to.
4,Lovely oldies - done refreshingly well,The CD is loaded with favorites of my youth - and done with a passion that truly comes through in every song. I am currently listening to the CD in my car and sing along (with the whole world watching!) every where I drive in the city.
5,Wonderful doorway into the world of Black Writers,I recently found myself searching for a book that would allow me to experience the works of black writers (especially female writers). This book was just that. It has small biographies on many writers (mostly female) and showed some examples of their work. It is a great key into the door I was trying to open. I am now not only more educated on who is who but also more empowered. I definitley recommend this book to anyone looking to become more educated in this genre.
1,Beyond horrific,I bought this based on the two glowing reviews. What a mistake. I found the recording to be faulty. An ear piercing whine can be heard for over ten minutes during one section. I tried to fast forward past the recording but it left me with a headache and the piece went straight into the garbage. This is the only CD I have experienced the problem. Leading me to believe it is the recording at fault.
3,Can you get by the long-winded prose???,"Let me start by saying that I have not read this entire book. In fact, I have only read a small portion of it at this point, so my review is only based upon what I have read. I will probably keep picking away at it, because I am very interested in the factual content. But, I decided to write a review now to warn others that if they want to read this book, they should realize what a committment it is going to be.To say that Gould is wordy or verbose in this book would be an understatement of enormous proportions. I am not exaggerating when I say that this book contains the most long-winded, meandering writing that I have ever seen. Some sentences, while perhaps gramatically correct, border on being incomprehensible simply because of their length and structure. While others may like this style, I consider it a insidious butchering of the English language."
1,Gould fails to get out of his own way,"I agree wholeheartedly with the review by ""A reader from Vic, Australia."" This book is a classic example of what happens when an author gets too big for his editor. The notion that he even had one must be taken as a matter of blind faith, as there is no empirical evidence for it.Gould might well have had something important to say in this book; certainly, that was my hope when I bought it. Unfortunately, however, he was too busy stringing together endless chains of metaphors and inventing analogies -- many of which are dead ends -- to tell us what it was."
4,A new idea,"To refute an earlier review:Forms *do* come out of nothing. Anyone who watches ice freeze can see this.I recall that an early biologist, looking at a spider's web, marveled at how the spider could assemble beads of goo with such regularity, so quickly. Of course, he didn't realize that this beautiful, complicated form arose on its own--it took a great physicist in the form of Rayleigh to see that.Somehow, the biologists still haven't grown up: there is no creator, there is no vital force. Things in the world do what they do because they follow physical laws.Gould's way cool. He follows a line of truly great biologists who say: pay attention!"
5,Salutary ecological effect,"Certainly, Gould's quest to sequester as much carbon out of the atmosphere as possible reached its peak with the publication of Structure. His magnum opus has contributed vitally to the fight against the greenhouse effect by incorporating on the order of a kilogram of carbon into each copy. I applaud the man for his dedication to climate stabilization."
1,A forlorn figure in the academic landscape,"Gould is massively popular with lay audience but his ideas are not well represented in the academia, at least not in evolutionary biology. He is a good scientist, but an opponent of good reductionism, hence confused.Bernt"
5,Tight band,"I was also at the Vail show last new years eve, great band. Great performers. Buy the cd, you'll like it"
2,Wav Rally vs. Splashdown,"If you are unsure about which of these to games to buy I would say Splashdown. Wav Rally really does not have a good game play and only has one track that is unlocked. It is hard to see where you need to be on the course. Splashdown has several courses that are unlocked and tricks are much easier to pull off. I love the 360 degree invert! So my final review would be, buy or rent Splashdown!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE! THE RACE MODE IT TOO HARD BECAUSE YOU HACE TO RUN INTO THESE STUPID THINGS AND THE JET SKIES SOUND LIKE AN OLD CAR. THE WATER LOOKS OKAY BUT THE REST OF THE LEVELS LOOK LIKE A DRAWING. IT SEEMED LIKE THE CREATORS OF THIS GAME WANTED TO GET THE MAKING OF THE GAME OVER WITH AS FAST AS POSSIBLE SO THEY COULD PLAY A REAL GAME! BOTTOM LINE: SAVE YOU MONEY!!
3,not a replacement for wave race,"The graphics are great, the waves are the best I have ever seen, better than splashdown. The menu selection process is slow and not very well thought out in design. This disc is one of those that makes a lot of noise inside the game player, its not terribly bad like some, but it is a little noisy. Though the waves are great, sound ok, the feel of racing the water craft is just not done very well, at least not as well as the original N64 game. I am disapointed because if they would have spent a little more time on a few details this would have rocked. One last coomment is that its difficult to see the boeys until you are right on top of them. If your trying decide between this or splash down, I think splash down may be a little more enjoyable, neither though are a great replacement of the N64 original. Maybe I am asking to much, but it seems like with a much more powerful system and 4 years difference in time that a better or comparable game could have been produced."
2,bad,"This game is really bad. I was hoping it would be as good or better than Splashdown but I was horribly wrong. The first flaw I saw in this game was the control. It is extremely difficult to get your jet-ski to turn in this game. You almost have to come to a complete stop to turn around and get to your target. The next biggest flaw is this games sound. Terrible. The jet-skis sound like old used cars. I own a jet-ski. I know what they are supposed to sound like. The graphics are nice. The water is beautiful but it doesn't look like water. It looks more like jello. But hey, it's pretty jello! I did have trouble with the graphics when there was a lot of action on the screen. It suffered from a bit of a slow down. So, out of a perfect 5.0 I give this game on:graphics: 3.5sound: 2.0control: 1.5fun factor: 2.5"
3,I OWN IT!!!,WAVE RALLY IS OKAY IT WAS A GOOD ATEMPT AT BRING SKI AND RUNABOUT TOGETHER. IT WAS FUN THE FEW TIMES I PLAYED IT. BUT SINCE I BOUGHT IT NEW FOR 3 BUCKS I DON'T CARE. tHE TRICKS ARE HARD TO DO AND THE RACING IS OKAY.
2,just not that good,This game is just not good. It has nothing extra to do but race on track and do a crapy freestal thing. The tricks suck and are hard to learn. Maby a rental but nothing other than that.
1,not much more to say beside's this game (...)!!,"Well this game (...)....really there isnt much more to say, the water look's real, but the jet ski doesnt handle like a real one AT ALL!!! The trick's are hard to do, and there is barly any trick's to do, You can do barle roll's with out a jump, ur jet ski just jump's up in the air and does a barel roll...Pretty stupid huh! When I looked at the pic's for this game I thought that it would kick (...)......But oh man was I wrong.... So if you dont belive me then at least just rent it first....u will be thanking me after u play it!!!! ttyl LATEZ"
1,Don't bother,"I don't know what Amazon is thinking selling this product, it's just a little spinning plastic that does absolutely zero. I get direct sun everyday (Arizona) so I thought the solar panel would work here, but the fan does not spin fast enough to circulate air through the car."
1,Can I give it negative stars?,"This thing was a huge piece of junk. I am more than mad. It never fit snugly, and when the window is up all the way, the fan won't spin. The unit always fell apart and I couldn't keep the pieces together. I could hear the air coming in while I was driving, and it drove me nuts. Every time that I would snap all the pieces back together, as soon as I tried to put it back in the car, it fell right back apart. The only way I was ever to get it to spin, was to stand outside the car and hold it in my hands. Huge waste of money!"
4,An Unfinished Affair,Great movie! Jennie Garth was wonderful in this movie. She should have been in more movies. This was a sleeper and is a should be seen movie.
4,Good practical tips,"I am a Candidate for Ordination as a Deacon in the Episcopal Church and read this book as a requirement for ""Deacon Formation School"". Overall, I thought it was good. Very practical. Many books talk about the importance of Evangelism but this book spells out how you can evangelize."
3,Leaves Some Basic Questions Unanswered,"I got this book hoping for information that would help me decide on a faith to follow, but I think this book is more for people who have already bought into the Christian god concept, not those of us who are seekers. The author writes pretty clearly, but some of this Jesus stuff is too out there for me."
1,Becoming a Naked Emperor Watcher,Question: What does the message of Bill Hybels have to do withkneeling before the cross of Jesus Christ?Answer: Absolutely nothing.
4,Contagious religion,"I hope people regard this review with an open mind.I give this book 4 stars because as a book it does very well to carry out its purpose. I do not doubt the sincerity of the author or his beliefs but felt myself laughing in disbelief at some of the suggestions he makes. For example making out that Christianity is the absolute truth and the way he tries to convert others. For me this is the perfect example of a meme and i read it with great amusement but with a tinge of sadness when I think that it is precisely this kind of religious exclusivism against other religions that is the main cause, albeit less overtly violent, of many of the pointless atrocities happening around the world for the sake of some god. It is sad."
2,Beware,"This series begins with an outright attack on traditional evanglism, even biblically-modeled evangelism. There is no doubt that relationships are also key to ministering, as modeled by Christ ministering to the woman at the well. However, this series seems to want to erase all the good that came from great evangelists of past times, including Billy Graham perhaps. This series is more of the ""seeker-friendly"" movement that is leading many to shallow religion. Beware."
4,Helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful. It has equiped me to encourage other Christians to evangelize their community. I have all of the resources on ""Becoming a Contagious Christian"" and I feel that I am a more effective communicator of my faith. I also feel that I am more equipped to train others to share their faith."
3,okay,I read this book for a very popular class at my seminary. I thought the book was okay but not very academic. I thought the foruma was a little cheesey and some of the examples a little bit also. If you are looking for a motivational book for evangelism this one will do fine. If you are looking for some very basic principles about evangelism than this book is fine. However if you want a theology of evangelism or more than just the very basics of evangelism then this book might not be right for you. I think it is mainly for very new Christians who do nt have much of a clue about what evangelism really means. I thought it was okay and a fast read but did not take it as academically serious as many of my other books I have read in seminary.
3,good for new christians,This is a good book for those just starting out in the Christian faith. Also a good study book for small groups and Bible studies.
5,Christmas present for elderly mom,This was a Christmas gift for my elderly mother. Mostly for my sister...so she won't have to turn up the car heat!!! Great product. Highly recommend.
5,Works great.,My wife uses it in our electric car when we want to turn down the car heater and extend the car range a little . One power setting: 48 Watts (4 amps) Heats up in about 3 minutes. Has a 30 minute and 45 minute timer. We fold it up and store it in our own cloth bag when not in use.
3,Doesn't get very hot and deceivingly small,I understand that this is probably great for younger children but I use it in a car with someone who gets warm very quickly as opposed to me who gets cold pretty quick in the winter. Doesn't get hot enough for me but does the trick.
1,disappointed,"Blanket does not get warm enough to make it better than any good quality regular blanket. Also, It gave off an unpleasant odor, a fuel like smell."
3,Great for travel,This blanket has been great for our winter travels. The only downside is that it cannot be machine washed. Didn't think to check that before buying. It is great for the family mini van.
3,to small for a twin size bed but does the job,I am a truck driver and because of the new idling laws i needed a way to keep warm. this blanket gets very warm very fast and seems to keep the warmth after turning it off. But it wares the battery down in my truck quickly. I repetitively had to get up in my freezing truck in the middle of the nite to turn on the truck to get warm once again. also the size is to small for a twin bed either my feet or chest got cold. this got very annoying unless you sleep curled up this will annoy you as well.
5,Heated 12v TWI 1000N Heated Throw,I use this throw in my RV when dry camping both in bed and over my legs at night while lounging. I slip it under the top sheet so it covers my lower body and feet. I turn it on as I get in bed and it warms my frozen feet and legs.It turns itself off after 30 or 45 minutes so I don't have to worry about falling asleep and killing my batteries.I liked it so well I gave it to a friend and now I have to buy another one.
4,warm at last,"The blanket warms fairly quickly, and keeps my legs warm. My husband will be eternally greatful because now I don't turn the heat up to ""unbearably hot"". (He swears that I kept the heat in the car up to 95 degrees before getting this blanket)."
2,"Terrible, u will be cold","This blanket is a waste of money, this thing barely gets warm to the touch, some people rated this 4 stars i just dont see how.I bought this blanket thinking it would keep me warm in my car at work when i'm on lunch and don't wanna run the car engine to keep warm. plugged it in to socket and the light on the cord came on. while the car just got colder and colder i waited and waited and after 20 minutes and this thing was barely warm to the touch it was as warm as my hand was ,, there was no noticeable increase in warmth in the car either . wow what a gimmick, i should have known it was too good to be true. dont waste your money, will not keep u warm. It was just annoying having this thing covering me totally useless."
3,I Like It Warmer....,"I like this blanket except for:1) The blanket needs to be a little bigger/longer.2) It does not have the ability to adjust the warmth level.3) I would rather have a machine washable blanket. But not sure how to do that because I presume the plug that goes into the car socket is why the manufacturer says not to wash it. I wash my bed electric blankets and don't have a problem; although after many washings of my king size dual-control electric blanket, it no longer works. My husband never uses a heated blanket, so when my side stopped working I flipped it over and used his side. Now neither side works. So instead of spending $100+ for another king size, I purchased a twin for $30."
1,Doesn't work!!!!,I received this blanket and it never worked! It made a weird buzzing sound and never heated up. What a joke.
5,Excellent product,"This electric blanket, powered by 12 volts DC current, was something I bought for the car this winter -- expecting very little. How warm would something of this lower voltage be? You'll be surprised! It heats twice as fast as the car's heater when the car and the blanket are started at the same time. It works well for me. My only complaint: it's not machine washable or dryable -- and it loads with static easily. I have not tried static-guard or anything like that on it yet -- maybe that'll help. For the price -- an excellent product!"
3,Great while it worked.,"I received the Trillium Heated Travel Blanket as a Christmas gift because I am always colder than anyone else in the car during the winter. It worked great the first four times I used it - helped make everyone comfortable as the heat could be set lower and I could stay warm. The fifth and sixth time, the blanket barely got warm and after that totally stopped working. It came with an extra fuse, but that was not the problem. This is a great product when it works. Perhaps mine was defective."
1,garbage,don't buy this is not warm at all and goes of every 15 minute don't waste your money i was hoping this thing will give me some heat i got nothing it good only if you want to clean on dashboard
4,Nice electric blanket,"We got this for my wife, as I like to keep the car cold when I drive. So, it works great for her."
5,travel blanket,Good deal. I was so cold in my heaterless 1992 Ford van I thought I'd freeze to death. I take my daughter to school and have to for her. Couldn't do anything but wait in the park cuz I couldn't afford any extra gas. So now I am toasty while I wait.
1,educational software,"When I put either disk in my computer (I have windows XP.), it nearly crashed the machine! It hung the computer and changed the screen display. I had to get into the set-up of the computer to get my Dell back to normal. As a past teacher, I was familar with the programs, which are great, and was looking forward to putting it on the machine for the grandchildren. I was terribly disappointed and won't dare to try installation again, becuase of what it did to the computer the first time."
1,Don't Buy,"My son is 4 and both of us were not impressed with this game. Poor quality or I received a bad cd. Stay with Reader Rabbitt, Jump Start games, which Legend of Grizzy McGuffin is great."
3,Very old but educational game,"The game was probably developed around 1996 - 1997. Graphics is poor compared to current educational games. It's jewel case states compatibility for Win 95, 98 and ME.We were not able to install it on an laptop with Win XP. It kept looking for a specific file for our video and sound card. But installation on a Win 2000 SP4 desktop went smoothly.The game is designed to run in 256-colors at 640x480. It will run on higher colors but the graphics won't look good. For current systems, you need to change Display Modes before or during playing the game.Game play is 2-dimensional. Do not expect any 3D animation. But the educational value is great. There are multiple choice quizzes about rhymes, numerical order, similar sounds, ending with same letter, etc. It also involves shapes, numbers and properties (color, big, etc.)Overall, the game has good educational value, but if you expect something truly interactive or 3D, you will be disappointed."
2,Really old fashioned,"Software is ANCIENT. Kids who are versed in more modern web-based software will probably get bored with it quickly. As mentioned in previous reviews, the resolution setting may cause problems for your sysetm, as it automatically attempts to set resolution at 640x480. Might be very educational, but alongside more modern software, very clunky."
4,Treasure Cove/Treasure Mountain,"I wanted this set for my 5 yr. old son because I have such good memories of one of my nephews playing these games. I haven't really been able to ""figure out"" the games, get them going on our computer, yet."
5,read the review,This is a funny book. I've had trips like that. And sometimes they make that much sense but it comes down to how much you want to trust any dream. I love Mckenna as he wades out into the lets figure things out pool because like Colombus he usually ends up in the wrong places and names it whatever he feels. Right or wrong he did it and you probably didn't. Read this book and watch the Mckenna boys fall apart.
4,Three Books In One,"I felt when reading this book 14 years ago that it was three books in one: the first comparing shamanism with schizophrenia, the second a chemistry text, and the third a somewhat awkward positioning of a template onto the King Wen sequence of the I Ching. The chemistry stuff was over my head, but I appreciated the fine line drawn between shamanism and schizophrenia. I learned nothing about electronic spin resonance unfortunately despite getting at least a B in high school chemistry.Having had some struggles with both shamanistic practices and mental illness is part of the daily grind some of us go through and it is the psychiatrist who tries to come up with the magic pills to assist the processes of both.I have done I Ching divinations in the past using 49 pennies and I am not too sure that we need to look for patterns there. Take it with a grain of salt. Same with any changes in brain chemistry due to what you ingest."
2,VERY hard to understand not going to lie,"I love terence mckenna and all his videos, and speeches and ideas and his work... dont get me wrong ive done alot of research on him and like him alot and bought this book hopeing i would learn some new things, & enjoy reading the book.i had no idea what he was talking about half the time... i know a good amount of info about drugs,shamans,religion,spirituality and life & so 4th... but this book was Extremly hard to understand and get through but i imagine someone with alot of education would enjoy this book but for all the average people out there i wouldnt recommend this book... the only chapter i enjoyed and could understand was the chapter about shamanism.-the penguin"
3,Was what was advertized,For the price the case will do the job.The hinges are a bit weak for the weight theyare managing but I can work through it.
1,Poor quality.,"You get what you pay for. Yes, it's an inexpensive alternative to changing out the valve/trim, but the finish quality is mediocre-to-poor. It's not a high quality brushed finish. Water spots are very evident. When the kit arrived, there was major discoloration on one of the pieces, so we ordered a replacement set from Amazon....same problem, only worse. In contacting Danco directly to obtain a replacement for the one discolored piece, the operator informed me that they do not provide such a service and that I would have to go back to the vendor. So, both kits were returned and I did what I should've done in the first place: changed out the valve.I'm happy to say that Amazon was very helpful and courteous throughout the whole ordeal."
1,Only fits certain Delta faucets,"Warning to purchaser - this kit only fits Delta tub/shower faucets with certain valve stems - diamond shaped stem with screw hole in center. It won't fit round end valve stems, and no handles are available in brushed nickel or acrylic that will match to this kit."
2,Not that well made,"This did not look as well made as I thought it might, and since it was going to be used for my main bath, with a lot of use, I decided against it, and returned it. For a guest or hardly used bathroom, I MIGHT have kept it."
4,Great way to update the bathroom,This kit replaces the trim on a Delta 600 series faucet. Delta only makes trim in gold and chrome. I wanted to redo the bath in a stainless finish. The kit was easy to install. I am not sure the finish is going to be as durable as the Delta. The flow diverter for the shower seems a little flimsy and sometimes I have to fuss with it to keep a lot water from coming out. I used this in the guest bath so its not a big deal but I probably wouldn't like it in my personal bath.
2,Not very comfortable,"I have tried to wear these bunion regulators at night when I went to bed. They made my feet uncomfortable enough to prevent me from falling asleep, and I could only wear them for at most ten minutes. I don't know if the discomfort is meant to be. If anyone wants to try this product, I would suggest buying one instead of a pair and try it on one foot first to see if you can wear it the whole night without being disturbed."
4,Best thing out there,I've tried the straps and other gizmos and this is the only thing that really works.
4,Such relief!,I sent this brace to my daughter who has a bunion and she says it has truly relieved the pain especially at night.
1,A cheap quality product!!,I purchased this product recently and returned it soon after. This is a very cheap quality product which every part of it was harmful. They put together a one dollar product and selling it for ~$20. It is shameful taking advantage of people this way.
4,"Okay, but not great","I previously had one of these for my right foot before I ended up actually needing surgery. Recently started experiencing similar pain in my left foot and thought I would try this. It is less comfortable than I remember the other one being. I also think I have it tightened too much, which caused my foot to be in pain the next morning. I am going to continue to use it, but with it less tightened."
1,Returned it the next day,"I couldn't return it fast enough. It was so painful to wear, pressing against my second toe. I thought it would be great for wearing to bed... If the hard plastic didn't scratch everything in its path, perhaps it would have worked. lol!Simply put, its extremely uncomfortable. It does not help with bunion pain in the slightest; it just causes new kinds of foot pains."
3,Not bad,"This is definitely the easiest product to use that I've tried. It stays in place very nicely, but it's still not very comfortable. The plastic pieces don't conform to my foot as well as I'd hoped, but since you can only wear it at night, it's not too bad. My podiatrist warned me against doing any walking with it because it might cause further damage that way. My feet don't bother me too much to begin with, but I didn't find that this helped me much, if at all. The thing that worked better for me was just better arch support in my shoes during the day. I still wear it while I sleep, but I'm just not sure it's doing much. If you're feet really bother you though, I'd say that it's worth a try or the $16 it cost me."
3,still evaluating bunion regulator,"I ordered this product because other reviews were so positive.....I guess I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I wear it every night - sometimes I use it daytime, too, if I'm home. I should have traced my foot before I started...so that I could track improvement. So far, I'm not convinced. It may be working; but, if it is, it will take a while. It is certainly not an overnight fix. I really want it to work, so I'll keep wearing it for at least another month or two. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because I really want to be able to buy shoes I like and have them fit and be comfortable."
3,Narrow feet are a problem,"I'm uncertain if I'll be able to use this w/o modifying it somehow. I got a small size but I think my narrow feet create a problem. Unless I put the straps in their last (strongest) possible position, my big toe is still too close to my next toe. Without more pressure on my big toe there's not enough space between them. Then the hard plastic touches and hurts my second toe... not to mention doesn't do much to help with my toe displacement. Even at that adjustment, it doesn't move my big toe over enough to help with the bunion and may not even be tension enough to keep it from continuing to worsen."
4,fast relieved,"In just few minutes i can feel the recovering of my poor ached foot, i wear it with toe sock (the edges are kind of hard) it really could use more padding, little expensive considering is just velcro, plastic and padding, however i'm happy with results, i keep it next to my bed"
5,Makes a Difference!,"I purchased this item several weeks ago after months of incessant bunion pain. I've worn it nightly to bed since, and it's making a huge difference. I only experience intermittent pain from my bunion now - very little compared to before. If put on properly, it is not at all uncomfortable to wear. I can walk with it on, though it's more awkward than barefoot, certainly. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Bunion regulator,I got it for my husband to wear while sleeping. He tried it for awhile but quit because he said the plastic part that went along the side of his big toe was uncomfortable. Probably could have tried some extra padding but you know how guys are.
3,For a more severe bunion?,"I bought this one to comparte to the Pedifix, and I think both are roughly the same. I can tolerate wearing them at night, but I still prefer the Yasco Bunion straightner."
1,DOESN'T WORK,"I took these to a podiatrist visit with me. He said that if the bone is out of alignment (causing a bunion), these are not going to bring it back into alignment. I returned them. Also, wore them a couple of nights and did not find them comfortable. Seller took them back with no problem."
4,Toe Splint Works!,"I am finding this night splint to be effective and fairly comfortable, considering it IS a splint and I have to sleep with it on all night. I like it well enough that I'd buy another one of the same brand if necessary."
4,Pretty good,This splint does what it says. make sure you buy the correct foot (right or left) they are not interchangeable. It is pretty comfortable to wear at night. It is not conducive to walking around. I don't know yet if it is really helping the bunion but the theory behind this device makes sense to help fix it before considering surgery.
1,expensive and hard,I used a couple of devices. This is hard so that cause some pain on feet. You can't walk freely with device.
1,BUNION REGULATOR,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY AND REALLY NOT EASY TO USE. IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR SHOE OVER IT. GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOUR BUNIONS REMOVED LIKE I DID....BOTH AT ONE TIME. IT'S BETTER TO BE ""DOWN"" MORE, ONCE, THAN ""DOWN"" LESS, TWICE. KEEP ""SHOPPING"",...YOU'LL FIND A PODIATRIST WHO WILL DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME (IF YOU HAVE THEM ON BOTH FEET)."
2,Very uncomfortable,"I knew it was made out of plastic, but I didn't realize it would hurt to walk on it. I would end up taking it off in the middle of the night if I had to get out of bed for any reason."
2,Bunion Regulator,Doesn't perform as advertised. By morning it has come off my foot.I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,AMAZING,I'm a huge skeptic I put this on & within 1 day the pain was gone. I did not have to put much pressure on it. I stand behind this product 110%
3,Bunion regulator,The bunion regulator is a great concept. It does what it is built for although it requires some getting used to. The only problem that I would really like to see resolved is to add some cushion to the hard plastic that separates the toes.
2,ruined it,"I have used this product for some 3 years now, and it USED to be amazing. I have no doubt it saved me foot surgery, but I just bought a new one because eventually, the velcro does wear out. The latest model shows GREED rearing it's ugly head. For the lack of a few inches of velcro (oh, I'm sure it was cheaper by at least two cents), they have ruined the product. It now will not stay on all night unless you tug it down to totally painful tolerances (apt to awaken you). Thanks FootSmart!! you screwed it up for pennies, and I sang your praises."
2,Not very pleased with this bunion regulator,"Hi all,I bought this product some time ago and tried it if it works, I was pretty disapointed as it is very hard, pinchy plastic and for my shoe size 6.5 it actually moves and comes off while sleeping. First night I couldn't sleep at all, it was very uncomfortable, then it got little better, but still causes pain in my big toe and slides off after rolling around in bed.. I wish it worked because it does separate the big toe from others, but not very well made..I don't want surgery either and will keep looking for some other products..good luck everyone..S."
3,Works as advertised,"I've been using the Bunion Regulator for about a month. It works as advertised. One has to get used to the feel of the thing. I have a 9-D size foot, and for a device designed to fit several foot sizes, it is reasonably comfortable, yet not a 'perfect' fit. I've found that I can sleep with it on. My bunion seems to be a bit less painful now that I wear the regulator nightly - this is good. I'd give it a five star but for its somewhat sloppy fit; and the price. This thing is made of of parts that cannot cost more than about a dollar or two. It would be better priced at $12.95. But do get one and try it; it certainly does pull one's big toe into proper alignment."
5,Straighter,This bunion regulator is very comfortable. The best aspect is the adjustability over the bunion area. Other bunion contraptions do not adjust in the primary area and consequently offer no benefit as they are too large.
5,Works great,"This is a much better regulator than the type you can buy at retail stores and pharmacies in pairs. This one fits better and not as bulky. It takes some getting used to though but does provide alot of relief. I would have already have had to have bunion surgery without it, i think."
3,dress up,"I bought this dress for my daughter and it was really cute, but is rather small. My daughter wears a 4t and this dress just barely fits her."
3,"Very Cute, but smaller","This play set is super cute- and nicer than most dress up outfits my daughter has, and the price was reasonable. It's a bit shorter than I would like for my 4 year old, so I can't picture it being long enough for a 6 or 7 year old. My daughter absolutely loves this dress!"
4,What about parts,"This is a very good heavy skillet For the money. But where do you find parts for them? We have two of them. One new. and one about two years oldthe older one need a new temp. control ( that plugs into the side)I have been trying to find parts for it, but no one has parts for them .That I can find. Even Amazon customer service can not tell me where to get the part I need. This skillet would be like most other products on the market today. Use it as long as it works. Then trash it and buy a new one.Precise Heat Electric Skillet"
2,A little disappointed,"I was very happy with the electric skillet when I first saw it. When I heated the pan and put in some cooking oil, much to my disappointment, the oil did not cover the bottom evenly. When I stood back and looked at the pan, I could see if wasn't sitting evenly on the base. What I had to do was put the booklet that came with the skillet under the one side. It did do a good job of frying the food."
2,It's not level,"I was very disappointed in this electric skillet. It is visibly unlevel (I tried various locations in case it was my countertop), and I have to put a pot holder under one end to make it level. The heat is not as consistent as I was expecting from reading the description, and food sticks more to it I think because of the inconsistency in heat. The only plus is that it is a 3 piece set and the size is perfect."
1,Bait and Switch?,I highly recommend NOT buying this item; the actual item shipped was of mediocre quality and poorly made. Spend a little more for a better piece of kitchen equipment.
5,First review stated this was a great buy. Now 3 years later?,As my previous reviews states my recipient was very pleased. Now 3 years later the skillet no longer heats. I have tried via Amazon and search of the web and have yet to find the contact number for the warranty. Anyone out there with their owners manual that would be willing to email me the contact number for Precise Heat? mikeretagraham@yahoo.com. Thank you very much!Great skillet. Given as gift and recipient loves it. Everything was exactly as described. Deliver was days earlier than expect. Amazon is a great place to shop for best prices on the internet.
2,Older reviews seem to be more favorable. . . . . ?,"I gotta wonder what changed with this Precise Heat electric skillet?? Older reviews seem generally favorable while the newest reviews are all poor - what changed? Perhaps that it is now made in China? That would explain the greatly ""reduced"" price. But read the newest reviews, pan is not level, lid does not fit, base cracks, etc, before you buy into this knockoff pan."
1,Disappointed,"The pan is not level and the heat is not steady. I thought the discounted price sounded good for a stainless steel pan, but the workmanship is disappointing."
1,"Shoddy merchandise, shoddy manufacturer","I purchased this skillet for a cabin so didn't use it within the 30 day warranty. Once I did use it, I found that the control would not fit onto the skillet. It was attached wrong, I fixed that. Then it was almost impossible to get the control off the skillet to wash it. For the price this product is cheaply made and the manufacturer's warranty completely inadequate for such a costly item. I am left with a virtually unusable and very expensive pan. I could have paid just a bit more and had the Oil Core Skillet which is fabulous."
2,Disapointed listener,"Well first of all this CD has only 6 song.I paid more than $15.oo for sex song? I dont know if mr.Shlemon is been listening to the latest Cds,they are all 12 to sometimes 16 songs.Shlimon has 6 I am mad and I want my money back.This Cd is only worth 6 dollars.Now the music its poorly recorded and playes.Many many mistakes in playing and the tuning of these real instruments are horable."
2,"This product is nice, but is heavy and came with some items broken","This exact same dinnerware is sold at Linen & Things as a 20 piece set for $19.99. I bought a set. Since the plates were heavy and I liked the shape, I thought the Corningware would be more like Corelle. Some of the items were broken in transit. This is the third time that I am receiving damaged goods. For years I have been doing business with Amazon without any problems, but now I will buy locally, because dealing with Customer Service is too time consuming. I do hope that Amazon will improve the way items are packaged. Lousy job on this shipment! Evelyn Touhsaent"
5,Pleasantly suprised!,"Ordered 2 sets of these dishes on Wed. Recieved the dishes 2 days later. Opened the boxes and I was really pleased. These dishes are not only lovely but they are really sturdy without weighing too much. The Asian shape is really nice and the plates, cups & bowls are all of an ample size. We are SO pleased with this buy. The price can't be beat and the quality is there. Way to go AMAZON!"
3,stains easily,"Tea stains stick to the inside of the cups more easily than other cups we have. The plates are heavy, but the cups have a nice handle shape and are NOT heavy."
3,"good quality, just too heavy","These are so heavy that little ones can't carry the plate very well. And when I'm unlaoding the dishwasher, I have to make more trips back and forth, can't do these all in one sweep. They are good looking and of high quality, but if I had to buy all over again, I'd pass on these. They are a pain."
4,great dishes,I have a set and love them. I always get complements on them and have had friends who wanted the same set. They are difficult to find and have heard they are discontinued. The only complaint I have is they leave gray knife marks but this may be the case with all white dishes. As to the comment of being too heavy they are not any heavier than other dishes I have had.
5,"Great, Inexpensive Dishes",The quality is excellent and the dishes are very heavy. The non-round form factor means the dishes don't roll around in the dish washer. These are great every day dishes and an excellent value for the cost.
3,Heavy and Bulky,"These are pretty nice quality, but after using Correlle for years, we found these very heavy, and bulky. The bowls don't fit in the dishwasher right. The cups are too big. We went back to Correlle."
4,Beautiful Set/Great Value,"Pros: The set is very sharp and makes my food look even more appealing to serve. Great price/value. A lot of people say the set is heavy. I am a decently strong man and have no problem loading or serving these plates with one hand. I actually prefer the heavier ""restaurant"" like weight of the dishes.Cons: Corningware does a bad job of packaging this set. A bowl was broken upon receipt. The mugs are a bit tall, and I usually don't drink the size of warm drink that it can hold."
1,"great look, but most were broken when arrived",the original corningware box which was CLEARLY marked fragile was placed in an amazon box which was NOT marked fragile. As a result 2 of the 4 internal boxes were broken. i just rotated the other 2 internal boxes and could tell they were broken as well. i am going to order a replacement to see whether items will be property packaged and shipped.
4,Good Dishes but Bad Shipping,"Just like most every other reviewer, I am satisfied with the product but was a bit ticked to receive a broken dish."
4,Corning dishes,"Stylish dishes that make even the simplest meal look gourmet! I love their look. I also like them because I prefer mugs to cups and saucers. The mugs are large and the bowls are deep (for lots of cereal). The only problem that I had was that a few mugs have hairline cracks where the handles attach to the mug. I don't know if they were there when I received them or they developed after we used them. Either way, this is a flaw. After using them for a year, I also find that they chip fairly easily. I attribute this to their weight which makes lifting them out of the dishwasher a bit awkward.All and all I am pleased with the dishes. They look great and were sold at a money-saving price (with free shipping!)."
3,Just White Dishes,"The unique shape was the selling point for me. I love the coffee mugs. The only problem is, I did not realize that they were so heavy. I should have ordered Corell, they are much lighter. I have RSD nerve damage to my hands and find that handeling these dishes is just too much. Quality is good, although I have already chipped a plate. These dishes would make a very nice gift for newleyweds."
3,Too Heavy,"One of the dinner plates chipped in the dishwasher the first time I washed it, perhaps the heat. The plates are heavy and awkward. I do enjoy the bowls but they are awkward to place in the dishwasher. I have been using Corelleware for many years and it is much lighter weight and chip resistant."
4,A design delight if you can take the weight,"I love the shape and size of each piece. The bowl especially has so many uses and seems the right size for each. The only drawback is that each piece is so HEAVY. Moving a stack of 4-6 plates is about as much as I can carry, and it takes two trips to move 6 bowls. So consider if from cupboard to table to dishwasher and back you are willing to carry this dinnerware. The design and quality make it worth that to me."
3,"Great product, but delivered broken","I absolutely love the dishes. I really like the simple design and the capacity of all pieces.The condition of the dishes on arrival was a big disappointment though. I ordered three sets. One of the three sets arrived broken. I made arrangements with Amazon for a replacement of the broken set. My replacement arrived broken. I then arranged for a replacement of that broken set. The second replacement was broken. When I tried to arrange for another replacement, they would only offer me a refund. I am satisfied with the resolution, but I feel this is a bit ridiculous as it ended up being quite a hassle.While this purchase was a disappointment, I have always had excellent service from Amazon and will purchase from them again. I will not likely purchase anything that requires careful handling."
5,You need this CD.,"Yes, you do. Where else will you get a country song about liposuction? A medley of heavy-metal songs arranged for a barbershop quartet? Get this CD... laughter is good for you!"
5,It's just a really cool CD,"A very diverse and impressive collection of a very talented and tight group. A little bit of everything: humor, soul, storytelling, and rock. This is the place to go to hear modern a-cappella at its best.And they sound great, too."
1,as good as next to nothing,"If you want some back support you're going to have to get one of the self inflating items. This one has an open cell foam inside that compresses almost completely making it almost no support at all. I'm returning mine, it's that useless."
2,"It's OK, but....","I was looking for the support, which is firm. This product was quite soft compared to what I had in mind. If you are looking for a firm support, don't buy this."
3,Mixed feelings...,"I truly adore Carlo Maria Giulini, especially his later recordings and performances, but this is a very shallow interpretation of this momumental masterpiece (one of my favorite compositions). I'm sure it has to do with the fact that there were limited rehearsals from musicians coming from all over the globe, because Giulini's other performance (on DG, on CD) is absolutely astonishing."
1,1 Time Use Disposable Headlamp,"Do not buy this product unless you plan on tossing it away after on use. This is one of the most useless headlamps I've ever used. I've gone through 2 of them already and have only used them one time each and now they are not working. Not only it breaks, but the batteries are very difficult to replace. It takes 3 tiny screws on the side that you have to undo before replacing the battery. The battery's life using the Krypton is maybe 1 hour long (if your lucky) before it gets too faint. This product is crap, and I'm sure there other products are crap as well."
5,Best Photoshop book I've read,"This books takes you through starting photoshop to building a solid, professional web site, covering both photoshop tools, techniques, tips, and web-site-building advice. The author has clearly been around the block a few times and knows his stuff. Even better, he knows how to teach. I've gone through a number of photoshop books over the years, but this is by far the most useful one I've ever seen. Long enough to contain information you need, but doesn't include any filler that most photoshop books have."
2,Poor quality,"I have to agree with the earlier reviewer who complained about the quality of this book.You are suppose to learn Photoshop by developing an example website. The problem is that the book constantly switches between giving you work to do on the website and exercises simply to learn Photoshop. But it doesn't tell you on what you are supposed to be working.For example it refers to, and I quote1. select the magic wand tool.2. click on the rectangle you just made.Problem is that you haven't just made a rectangle you have just aligned some text from a previous exercise.The book is full of stupid errors like these.The best one yet is ""Select the color shown"", yet the book is in black and white?I would advise purchasers to choose another book. One where the author has attempted to do that which he is teaching."
3,Quality Assurance Lacking,"I am disappointed with the apparently low level of Quality Assurance that went into the production of this book. Within the first 2 chapters there are several instances where critical key combinations are in error (e.g. reads ""press Del to..."" when it should be ""press Ctrl+Del to...""). I have had to hunt around pressing keys and then annotate my copy of this brand new book with the correct information. In addition, the files at the book's website often don't match the instructions in the book. Particularly annoying are the ones that are flat .PCT files rather than Photoshop files. The book tells you to do a bunch of things with the file that aren't possible with a static image. Eventually I will extract the information I need, but it is frustrating to suffer sloppy writing (and editing) that should have been corrected before publication."
5,Delightful read,Ms. Avery is a delightful author. The humor she injects into her writing of everyday life is a refreshing change. Her characters are easy to relate to.I would definitely recommend this book.
5,"It's all been said, and It's all true","This is THE Masterpiece of the entire Transformers line. I was lucky enough to find it in japan since most stores told me it was SOLD OUT. I have to say the japanese version is better, it's got metal & plastic parts like the original prime figure. More importantly, it DOESN'T have those horrible ""american company executive, 'let's change a perfect thing'"" blast marks & short stacks. Honestly, the only time we saw Prime that torn apart like that was when he was dying, and I don't need to see him that way. Why'd we get stuck with kiddie version, dying Prime?? Get the import version if you can, it's not much more!"
4,If you miss the first time and the trailer's too expensive...,"Hey, this is a cool figure of Optimus Prime, espeacially with the articulation and nifty sound effects.Love the detail bits, especailly nice touches like the moving mouth piece down to the movable fingers.Inspite of the cool phrases from the movie,it was pretty disappointing the voice chip wasn't that of the actual voice actor.(case of misleading immpression it would be FROM the movie=actual voice actor.)Have yet to transform tho, initial 'breaking of the limbs' nearly freaked me out till I discovered it can be snapped back on. So far, I guess it'd have to settle as a really cool display."
2,Poor product,"On Christmas eve, the toy package was opened. The plastic cover was torn down to get the transformer out. My grandson was very happy to see the toy. But one foot came loose. It was never stayed intact. Whever transformation was performed, the part kept loose. My grandson totally was dismayed. I could not return it, because the package was not in original condition as Amazon's return policy requires."
4,Great Bot but not for kids,This is the US release of the TAKARA Japanese Master Piece CONVOY 01. the articulation is awsome and the in scale megatron is a ncie touch. the chest opens to reveal his matrix like in the old transformers movie. Price is good when you compare to Japanese version avail from Brians toys
5,THIS OPTIMUS PRIME IS A MUST HAVE!!,I recived my prime today it is awesome awesome awesome ! whata work of art and a toy for any TF fan to apsolutly buy . just when you think you have seen everything on it there is more detail. the truck for is awesome the robot is even better. it is very heavy cause its made of so much diecast metal compared to the originalwich i have one of those also the size is incredable. all i have to say is aaaawwwweeessooooommmeeee!!
4,The Ultimate Prime,"It hardly gets better than this. If you're going to own just one version of Optimus Prime, make it this one. Accurate detail, superb construction, innovative features and more points of articulation than I can count! The 20th Anniversary Optimus Prime is the perfect item for any Transformer fan.Of course this kind of quality doesn't come cheap. As far as Transformers go I think only the classic Fortress Maximus cost more. But in my opinion this edition of Prime is worth every penny. I only hope masterpiece versions of other popular Transformers are released in the future.There are only two down sides as far as I'm concerned. The company packaged Optimus VERY securely, so getting old Op out of his box proves to be a time-consuming task. Also, the other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that Matrix is hard to get out of Prime's chest!"
5,BEST TRANSFORMER EVER!!!,"I just recieved it today & I couldn't believe my eyes! The packaging is authentic, the robot is astounding, & I was speechless!I put 5 stars on fun because it is the most fun transformer EVER!I put 5 stars on educational value because it is good in developing motor skills!!!I put 5 stars on durability because is is super-posable!!!"
3,cool toy to have,Well i opened it and i cant seem to get the batteries to work or even get to the batteried so it does not make any noise. So i just put it on display instead. It is strange that i can not get into the battery case or even turn it on strange. But I will keep it it is a good piece to have. I know opening all the items does not mean i am a collector but i just dont want them in a box. well i hope this helps
2,avoid this one,"I was really looking forward to this toy, but it is quite a disappointment. Just getting through the maze-like packaging is a daunting task, which in my case required boxcutters and scissors over the course of a half-hour. Once you have the toy out, you find that notwithstanding the high-quality materials, it is badly designed. Parts of the toy keep popping out of place, and some of the joints are jammed so that transforming becomes an act of both strength and frustration. All the vaunted battery does is light up a little LED--not very exciting. The moving mouth effect is cute, but besides the nice die-cast metal, that's about the only good thing there is. The price is outrageous for what you get. Give me the original G1 over this hunk 'o junk anyday--I'm sending this one back."
4,Great toy with one individual flaw,"Okay, I've been a fan of Transformers since I first saw the cartoon when I was a wee lad. When I heard about this version of Optimus Prime coming out I just had to get it, it just took me a few years. Now that I do, I'm glad I bought it. Everything about it is great save one small issue that seems to be only reticent in my individual toy. One of the legs keeps popping off fairly easily. What would otherwise be a perfect toy is tarnished by this small but extremely noticeable flaw. My recommendation is still to buy but just beware of some issues you may find with it."
5,The Best Optimus Prime ever!,"I got both versions back in Jan. 2004, I like the way Prime transforms ( that took sum time to get right ). With getting Unicron last fall and now Prime I can say what will Takara and Hasbro come up with for us soon. I know some of us would like to see Megatron ( not in the USA ), but maybe Takara will make one in Japan. Maybe. It would be nice to see what happens now."
4,Hillarious,"this game was one of my first horse PC games and I was quite entertained. the best part, however, is not the competitons but while training running your horse and rider smack into the obstacles, having the rider fall off quite dramatically and get back up with a huge smile on her face. it made me laugh every time it happened!"
2,Disappointing Performance of Fine Haydn,"I purchased this disc largely because it was relatively inexpensive, and the selections of symphonies are simply superb! However, upon listening, I was fairly disappointed in the performances: it lacked to a good degree the enjoyment, and zest, that one expects in a Haydn symphony... Was there some problem in development ?So, not recommended then, unfortunately.[But if you are interested in a fine collection of his symphonies: try the Oxford 92, along with 93rd and the Surprise 94. But it is rare to see them on one disc; the 93rd and 94th are often placed together however, as here.]"
5,Staff loved it!,I ordered four of these for my different workgroups for Christmas. They were very well received. They loved them! Would definitely order again.
4,Great for political science course,I purchased this book for my political science class and it has done the job since I bought it. It gives definitions of every political term and includes essays on different topics.
5,Two thumbs up.,"This is one of the most comprehensive and handy reference texts for political science student. Invaluable for any undergraduate or someone interested in gaining an increased understanding of political science. Highly readable and comprehensive and will serve as atrusted companion for any serious student or practioner of political science. I bought my copy in 1999 and I still hold on to it and turn to it when the occasional idea I hear from ""experts"" on tv fails to ring a bell."
2,disappointing,"As a politcal science student, I found this book missing political terms that should be in a dictionary of politcal science. I also found some definitions incomplete. Great for students in middle school or high school. I find it hard to believe that this would be useful to any political science undergrad unless the student has absolutley zero knowledge of previous and current political regimes or political philosophy."
5,Great style for great price,"Easy to assemble, modern, stylish, not too heavy, not too light, just right. Take a lot of abuse from my kids and look like new today."
2,Interesting data; deeply flawed analysis,"A cautionary tale of what happens when mathematicians try to do anthropology/linguistics. Some of his quotations are so bad that you'll laugh out loud. On the other hand, the data that he brings together is fascinating and he makes a good-faith effort at interpretation (unlike some of the 19th century sources that he quotes from). A quite interesting, if deeply flawed investigation into the subject.To sum up the greatest underlying error: the assumption that cultures will always move ""upward"" in the complexity of the counting practices and never revert to a system that he considers more primitive. Numerous historical examples are available to counter his assumption."
5,Doing research on MONSTERS? Start here.,"Douglas knows his horrors (he's also Carlos Clarens, author of ""An Illustrated History of Horror and Science Fiction Films"")-- and this book lays out in detail the backgrounds and histories of the legends and myths concerning vampires, zombies, werewolves, mummies, and ""creatures"" such as Frankenstein's monster and the Golem. It's a bit florid in places (understandably) but chock-full of detail and surprising info on how our boogie men came to be. Hard to find, but worth tracking down if you're doing a paper on such things (try also books by David J. Skal in that case). Enjoyable and informative, especially for the young."
2,The pictured wire loom clips are NOT included!,"I haven't installed them yet - but they're spark plug wires - what could go wrong?But I chose these because I saw the wire loom clips shown in the picture on this product. They are NOT included!However, only 4 wires are pictured when I actually received *6*!!! There are 2 coil to distributor cables. I'm not sure why there are 2. I'd rather have 1 and the pictured loom clips.Otherwise, they appear well made. I dislike not receiving what is clearly pictured."
3,Nice Try,"I loved all of these songs when they originally came out. This ""unplugged"" version is nice as well.. but I think I was expecting more from this. Michael is so talented and has a great voice. I just recently saw him in concert and it made me miss listening to his music!"
4,A very pleasant surprise,"If you can get past the fact that these are not the original hit versions, you will find that this is a nice, mellow CD to listen to - just like I'd imagine going to see Michael live would be. The sound quality and the performance are both wonderful, with a ""Mountain Stage"" feel. The reworking of ""Whenever I Call You Friend,"" with Alison Krauss from Union Station, is a revelation - I fell in love with the song all over again. If you find this one at a bargain price, which isn't hard to do, definitely give it a chance."
1,Then & Now Review,"If you are looking to hear the original versions of Michael Johnson's ""Bluer Than Blue"" and ""This Night Won't Last Forever"" this is not the disc to buy. Then & Now contains newer versions of his greatest hits. If you will, this is more of an acoustic version of his original hits that will leave you disappointed."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzz!,"I was also very disappointed with this CD. I felt that the songs were drawn out and sleepy. I was hoping for the original sound of ""THEN"" and didn't care for the ""NOW"". This one will rarely come out of my CD rack. Note: Do not operate heavy machinery while listening to this CD."
5,best Christian metal album ever!,"I absolutely love this album. With apologies to Stryper's ""Soldiers Under Command,"" I rank ""Last Train"" as the best Christian metal album. The album starts off with the energetic ""Virtue and Vice"" and ends with the somber ""Last Train""--a song about the rapture and all who won't be attending. Their version of the Rolling Stone's ""Gimme Shelter"" is amazing. It's better than the original, in my opinion. ""Hallow's Eve"" is also a standout track."
2,A Music Review Is Always Subective,"I had a significant CCM music collection from the early 1990s, and re-bought this item. Both times I bought it, I wanted the ""Gimme Shelter"" cover. The title track is also a good tune, but I found myself disliking the CD as a whole.The band is hard rock, but, in my opinion, the music is over-produced and sounds far too soft and refined for the genre. The lead vocalist has a voice that, to me, is better suited to singing soft rock. It was nice to hear another version of the Stones' old tune, but I don't think most people would be happy buying this CD for anything else."
3,Historically correct,"My great grand uncle, George Beazley, was the first to run the Makapu'u Lighthouse in the 1800s. He was followed by a friend's step-grandfather, Sam Amalu. Both of us are impressed with the detail and historical correctness of Dean's work on Hawaii's Lighthouses. It makes a great gift if you have any relation to people who have run lighthouses here, and that is exactly what my purchase was intended for. Great idea!"
2,Not great,"I bought this because I was getting tired of playing online games over and over again with my toddler. Well, both me and my toddler think most of these games are boring. She likes Reader Rabbit Toddler MUCH better. Maybe an older toddle would like this better but I doubt it. Don't waste your money, find a better game."
2,Not so educational!,I wish I could return this set. My daughter hasn't learned anything new from it. She's 2!
1,WOn't work with MAC,"I bought this based on the belief that it would work with my MAC - it does say, in the product description, that it works in a MAC environment. Well it does not and unfortunately, I am thousands of miles away so I cannot return the item.SO, I cannot even comment on whether or not it's a great product - I have been unable to get it running on my iMac!"
4,Good first experience with computers,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this program. He started out having problems with his mouse skills, but soon mastered the interface. After a month, he has just about worn out this program.My only reservations is that it runs on a 640x480 screen and does not automatically adjust the display when it starts (win98/SE). At the resolution I use on my computer, the screen is to small to see. It would be great if they had the program auto-adjust the screen resolution and mouse sensitivity."
3,Preschool Computer Lab Teacher - OK for 4-5's,"I have taught preschool computer lab for two years and have used this software package both years (disks 1&2 only - we don't have a printer which is needed for disk 3). I have found this software to be too complex for my 2 & 3 year old students, but have found some success with my 4-5 year old students. They have some difficulty maneuvering through the games but learn with experience.The students enjoy the puppets which they can dress-up and make dance; they also like the coloring area.Overall, this software is certainly NOT the most popular in my computer lab, but my students seem to enjoy this software to some extent."
2,Not worth the money,"I had purchased Jumpstart 1,2, and 3 for my older child as she was growing and we loved all of these so I purchased preschool for my 3 year old. It is cute but not what you would expect for $30. I don't think the games are quite challanging enough. The art studio is a joke. It seems that they would have alot more games for the money.."
3,Good as a reference,"Modern Winemaking has quite a bit of useful information, and it's well-written and informative. However, this is not a book for beginning home winemakers. Jackisch spends a lot of time on the chemistry of wine (an important topic) but comes up short in practical suggestions, sensory evaluation, equipment choices, and other important areas. That said, if you're looking for more advanced info on wine chemistry than can be found in the introductory books, by all means give this book a try.PS: UC Davis Enology dept. has an EXCELLENT .pdf book available for free download. Don't miss it."
4,"If you like house, club, remix...then","Am 110% satified. If you like house, club, remix than check this CD out. I'm dancin' right now. The beat goes on and on and on and on.................."
1,Terrible interface and tutorial,"The game looks really cool, and it looks very detailed. However I've not even moved a man. The tutorial is horrendous, didn't have the patience for it. Other games I've tried have excellent tutorials where they walk you thru the interface. This tutorial has a bunch of popup windows that move all around the screen so you have to keep jumping around to close them, I'd close one and another would immediately open. I couldn't figure out how to stop this tutorial popup frenzy so I had to suffer thru it. The manual has a lot of detail about game concepts, but not enough in the way of game interface and how to perform rudimentary things. I've never launched a game before that I couldn't figure out by experimenting. Every time I click on a button to see what it does, my map disappears and nothing I click on will get it back, and nothing in the manual would tell me how to retrieve it. Ended up having to quit and restart the game. Very frustrating!"
5,Incredible Playing!!,"I came across Ed Bickert recently on Youtube when a jazz player friend of mine, who knew I just got a Telecaster, emailed me a link of Ed from the late 60's-early 70s. I had heard others playing jazz chords on tele's but this guy was something I had never encountered before. After about a week of listening to everything on the internet from him I could find I bought this album based on the sole previous review, which I whole-heartedly agree with. This has now become my favorite! The only criticism I can come up with, if it is one, is that the bass level in the recording is just a little hot. It certainly lends to the feel of the recording and perhaps is what was intended, afterall the bass playing (Don Thompson) is equally as excellent. Highly recommended!! Hope this helps. :-)"
4,Review of Euromix,"This is not a bad continuous mix cd. However, do know that it is not from the same label that produces the Tony Monaco Euromix series (12 & counting) so do not expect the same level of quality here. This continuous mix is enjoyable but doesn't have the energy of the other Euromix cds. One possible reason for this is the that rather than skipping from song to song rather quickly, this version plays long version of many of the tracks (e.g. you get to hear 8 min. + of Yojo's Hold On).Not bad for your buck though."
1,If you like hard rock then it's OK,"I thought I was buying a country record but except for 2 or 3nice songs the rest is screatching electric guitars, 3 setsof drums, shouting back vocals....it's hard rock and I hatethat.The grean CD - supposed to be the Country versions - is purenonsense. It's somewhat less noisy and you hear some moresteel guitar. I just do not understand how Shania is consideredas a country artist. She probably was during the early 90's butafter the interruption of Garth Brooks, Country music changedinto heavy rock and Nashville didn't stop this trend towards it.If you like Country and want to listen to it you will have tobuy remastered versions of artists from the 60's, 70's and 80'slike I do. Nowadays -again- I inmensely enjoy listening to f.e.Gene Watson, Johnny Duncan, Johnny Lee, Moe Bandy, Charlie Richetc. etc. etc. That's what I call Country and not this ""heavy,punk-like pop rock whatsoever!"
2,"Nice dictionary, bad quality","It would be a nice dictionary if not the build quality. The most important thing is that it freezes randomly and sometimes it is hard to make it work again, because pressing the reset button and even removing batteries do not always help. First time it happened several months after we bought it. I was able to reset it by pushing random combinations of buttons. Now, after 2.5 years of use, it is dead with half of the screen black and half white. No reaction to reset, batteries removal or keyboard.Think twice!"
1,very glitchy and wonky,"For this day it is already the third item in a row for us. We had to replace it twice. If it wasn't the seller's policy not to give refund after one week, we would definitely prefer a refund.The first dictionary could stop working and none of the buttons responded till we would take out the batteries and then put them back in. Usually it happened every day. Than we asked to replace it, and the next unit worked ok for about 2 or 3 weeks. Then it stopped working forever with all our attempts to replace the batteries etc.Hopefully, the third one would work better, but who knows... The message was clear from the very beginning. I would never buy it one more time, even if for less."
2,Extremely unreliable gadget,"My friend and I each bought our Ectaco translators a few years ago from different retailers. Approximately one year later they both stopped working. There was a problem with display. This was extremely disappointing particularly after contacting the head office in the US. The customer service was absolutely horrible... The software is good if you install it on a pocket PC or a PC. But for its price it's not worth the money, that's for sure..."
2,Only good for dogs that aren't chewers,"This ball does not last at all. We gave it to our 1 yr. old 60 lb. english setter/lab and her tooth went through it within a half an hour. If your dog chews even mildly hard, pass this ball up. The company we bought it from refused to refund our money and told us to go to the company that manufactured it. I did and spoke to a wonderful lady that told me they changed from a hard plastic to a soft one. Unfortunately she didn't have any of the harder ones left. She did refund my money - which was great to stand behind your product. I will not ever buy from the seller of this toy again. The company is called PetStore. They don't stand behind what they sell. I even said that to them in an email and they replied with a sorry... It really is too bad because she loved this ball, but I can't have pieces coming out as she is playing with it."
2,Didn't make it through dinner,Gave this to my lab/retriever mix before dinner and had to take it back before we finished eating. Chewed a big hole in it. If your dog is a chewer this ball is too soft and the indents give a dog to many corners to work on.We did play fetch for a few minutes and it worked great for that; he could really pick it up easily due to the shape. Should be fine for supervised play or a dog that try to chew it to pieces.
3,good graduate textbook,This is a good choice for the main text of a graduate course that extends digital signal processing to images and other two-dimensional data. It is a bit dated in its content now and must be supplemented to cover more recent topics such as subbands and wavelets and video signal processing. The book requires a solid mathematical background.
5,I really liked this book,The Food Combining 2-Day Detox: This book told me everything I needed to know and did it simply. Great book!
4,The Voice,"Being a fan from the day-she had and still has the most beautiful voice you can imagine.Some of her songs still bring me to tears. I am requesting that ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes?"" is played at my wake."
1,Total waste of time and money,"Most code samples don't even compile. A third of the book is wasted on some fictional account of an idiotic detective (what does that have to do with Delphi programming??). The technical info is scarce, and there isn't any depth whatsoever. Not worth the effort of opening the package."
2,No satisfaction with code or publisher!,"Much of the code was ommitted on the CD. The code that is there does not work. There are no updates on the publisher's site as specified in the book. One of the authors who replied to my emails was sympathetic, but was also dissatisfied with the publisher. The chapter on hierarchical databases was the worst offender - and the main reason I bought the book. So much promise, so little gain. However, it was written well and I like the explanations. Raymond Kennington"
5,Excellent collection of songs,"I play this CD over and over. Horace Andy has a voice like an angel, and this collection is wonderful."
4,good music but taken from other CDs,"The selection is good and rather varied, although the sound is overall traditional, a little ""old-fashioned"" for most of the music. The pieces are well-known to belly dancers and often used in performances, but be careful and check the musicians first as the pieces are all taken from other CDs. You may end up buying music you already have."
1,Dead on arrival.,"Item was dead on arrival. The wedge normally on the stem to keep the battery disconnected was missing, so suspect that the battery went dead. Amazon was excellent in processing the return for refund. Will reorder another unit to see if that will work."
4,We miss ya Eddie,"Its criminal the lack of coverage this great artist's death received in the media. We miss ya, old friend"
4,Great toy - but 89 bucks!!!,"This toy is fun and my kids love it. It seems to be holding up fairly well, but I would not trust it to be left outside in a rainstorm. That being said, unless this version is gold-plated or comes with a persoanl entymologist, 89 bucks is a rip-off. This looks identical to mine, which is a Backyard Safari Talking Bug Identifier. I got it for around 30."
2,Over priced,I purchased this book after reading all the fine reviews. Let¡s just say I plan on returning this book.Maybe I don¡t understand fine art or perhaps I don¡t appreciate the creative side of how this book was put together however I definitely don¡t think this book is worth ($$$)This book is thick and put together with a fine paper however what I found in this book was many solid color pages or just photographs placed on one corner of the pages with rest of the page completely blank or repeated images with slight difference. It is a well put together book with lot of negative space but maybe all the images could have put in half the book instead of spreading everything out in so many pages. I did find few design ideas and few cool looking pages but like I said before I personally don¡t think it¡s worth that much.
5,A MUST GET,"What a beautiful book, plenty for everybody. the colors spreads and painting spreads are so different from other design books.this book is not typical design!"
4,Praise him Seawind style!,"Being a diehard Seawind fan, i had great expectations for this album. Needless to say I was not disappointed.That great Seawind horn sound and accompanying funk grooves bring back memories of yesteryear.For those who are not familiar, Seawind the band was no stranger to Christian music as there previous albums all contained spiritual subject matter.This album is a definate facet to anyone's Seawind collection."
4,Lots of information,"We bought this book to inform ourselves for an upcoming trip through the Panama Canal. It was of immense help once we were sailing through the Canal, listening to the Ship's Commentator.We could now understand why and because so many hurdles were to overcome with the building of this beautiful passage between 2 seas."
5,Excellent overview,This book gave a comprehensive narrative and pictorial overview of the building of the Panama Canal. I learned many interesting facts about this project that I had somehow missed in school.
4,Building of the Panama Canal in historic pictures,"What I liked about this book was at the very front, rare pictures of the France's effort to build the canal in the 1880's. All in all a great book for the price."
3,tip pack,"I'm glad the tips are replaceble, however ,that being said there is no reason they should break. they want three more words before I'm allowed to submit this review"
2,No spray,"How well does it work? I don't know how well it repels critters. Because the spray just won't spray. I hear a motor running but nothing comes out the business end. Tried pressing that trigger for a few minutes with this result, then gave up.Do the batteries need changing? I dunno. I assume they have QA in place to prevent units from being shipped with old batteries. Is it clogged? Dunno. Kind of strange to have it clog at first use, but it's possible. Am I teed off? Yes."
1,Rabbits are digging up my lawn.,I used the entire 128 ounces on my yard. I have bushes and grass the jack rabbits like to eat. This spray did not deter them. They are continuing to dig up the roots to my grass.
1,Didn't work,"Followed the directions, turned the sprayer on - it hummed but didn't spray.. Re-read the directions, still hummed - didn't spray.I then transferred some if the liquid to a spray bottle - sprayed around the area I wanted to keep animals out of. Within hours, my dog walked to that area & defecated. It seems to me that a repellant that claims to repel deer & rabbits. would work for dogs also."
1,If the sprayer doesn't work.. can't test the spray!,"We have not been able to get the sprayer on this product to work! Batteries are OK and the pump motor runs. Just can't get the pump to prime! My wife tried and then I tried. Apparently the tubing is blocked.We have another sprayer that my wife will try so that we can see if the repellent works. Right now, we have no idea if it works or not!We have rabbits, chipmunks, and deer that eat my wife's flowers and garden. Other commercial repellents work, but this one seems to have a less objectionable odor in the bottle. We hope it turns out to be effective on our critters!!Will update the review when we try it with a different sprayer."
4,Deer Off,"This is a wonderful application method for a wonderful product.However, TWO BOTTLES CAME WITH 4 AA BATTERIES EACH WHICH DID NOT WORK.So, after replacing the batteries, I very much enjoyed using the sprayer and have recommended it to a friend with the warning that she would have to have 4 AA batteries on hand to use the sprayer. This can add $4 or more to total cost in addition to my initial disappointment that the item may not work.Yes, I would do it again. I would rate it 5 stars plus if it had been in working order from the start. I would also have bought it if the add had stated batteries required."
1,Does NOTHING for squirrels!,I used this product to try to deter squirrels from a bird feeder. It did NOTHING!!! Total waste of money!
2,Spray Gun Doesn't Work,"At this writing, I have no idea how effective the Havahart Deer Off may be. The battery-powered spray gun that came with my package does not spray, despite all of my efforts. This solution seems too thick to spray with a common spray bottle, and it's far too foul to consider some other method of use. (The main ingedient is putrified egg solids.) So, for now what I have here is a paperweight. That is unfortunate, because I do have some squirrels in my shed that I'd like to chase away. I will amend this review when and if I can manage to use the product."
4,Somewhat Effective and Easy to Use,"We've had continual issues with deer, rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers, vegetables and fruit. We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets. I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell. I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers, several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry. The deer seem to be repelled, with no evidence of any damage from them. On the negative side, the chipmunks aren't deterred at all. They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note, the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping. The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking, but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try. If you're trying to control chipmunks, don't waist your time."
4,Works Well,Havahart Deer Off seems to work as advertized. The deer had mowed my hosta beds to the ground prior to getting Deer Off. The hosta is slowly coming back and the deer are staying away. The application of the product has been once per month and has held up even with a watering system. It seems to be a very good deer deterent. My only complaint is that the nozzle gets clogged periodically and has to be cleaned.
4,I think it works,"We had a deer nibbling on our garden, she snacked on the cucumber plant, corn and peas. We sprayed this on the garden and she hasn't been eating anything lately but it is hard to tell for sure because she had a fawn and once the fawn was big enough she is venturing further away so she just might not be coming to the garden any more? That is why I am not positive it is the product that is working or if she just changed her pattern of travel."
4,Works Well,I have used the previous version of Deer Off so knew what to expect. I loved the battery powered sprayer. It is much easier than the old sprayer. The Deer Off itself worked well. We are in a drought and the deer are very hungry. After I sprayed they left my flowers alone. The only down side is the fact that after watering or rain (which we have not had) you have to re-spray. I am having to water once a week just to keep things alive and that means that I have to re-spray. I have quite a few flower beds so the Deer Off will only do a couple of spraying.
2,Solution (Literally) For Sprayer Malfunction,"Like most everyone else, I found the sprayer got clogged within minutes of use. My ""solution"" was to (a) wear very good rubber gloves, (b) fill a bucket 3/4 full of hot water, and (c) remove the sprayer from the bottle when stuck and soak the sprayer. I found it took less than a minute to de-gunk the sprayer by doing a few practice sprays as it took in the hot water. I had 3 bottles so was able to finish the job fairly continuously (in a small yard) by rotating in the ""good spray"" bottle while my wife cleaned out the clogged sprayers with the hot water bucket. Clearly not ideal and the manufacturer needs to change the design...but this was our short term fix. The product did deter (but not eliminate) squirrels and rabbits; rain/irrigation washes it away pretty quickly too."
2,Havahart Deer Spray.,"Used it to try and deter squirrels from around my bird feeder. Didnt work at all, even after 3 sprayings."
2,Spray Nozzle Will Not Prime,"Well, I've tried everything I know to do, and so has my husband, to get the sprayer to spray. The batteries are good and properly inserted, the motor is functioning but nothing will come out. We've carefully followed the directions on priming, checked for kinks in the hose, turned the blue nozzle to to the ""on"" position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid. Yet, it simply won't spray.Since the sprayer won't work, my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed. So, at this point I don't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters, but the sprayer definitely doesn't function as it should. Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing. I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied."
4,Keeps away the pests,"I live in the middle of the woods and have a lot of deer, never too much of a rabbit problem. When I received my Deer Off I went outside and sprayed away, I didn't notice any bad odors that are so many times associated with repellents, which was a huge plus for me.The hand held sprayer is convenient and the off/on switch is rather nice as well. I'm not sure if I sprayed too much but I did notice white splotches after the product dried on some of my plants.The deer have definitely stayed away, the down side is that we've had a LOT of rain here and I've had to spray too often for my taste, but that of course is not the products fault. The only downfall is the price, but I guess it's worth it when you're able to keep your plants looking nice instead of feeding them all to the deer.Too bad it doesn't work on the chickens, they love my hostas."
4,Ease of application made this product excellent,"I have a large area to cover to keep herds of deer from trampling over my property. The ease of application and automatic sprayer made using this product a breeze. I definitely have less animal traffic in my back yard. I don't know how effective this product is for protecting gardens. Other reviewers seem to indicate that tasty blossoms and food overcome this product's ability to deter being eaten. My experience is that when deer have a choice to nibble on a neighbors foliage without this ""Deer Off"" versus mine, they select the neighbors. Good product for me and the sprayer is valuable - I've used it to put down weed killer as well."
1,Killed Every Flower in our Garden!!,Don't waste your money on this product. Within 24 hours it killed all five varities of flowers we had planted a week earlier. We had to go out and buy and plant all new flowers. Big waste of time along with the money.
4,So Far So Good; A Little Difficult to Apply,"We live in the woods, deep in the woods and the deer like to play in our yard and snack on our shrubs and plants. So every year, my holly bushes get eaten back to nothing and the rhododendron get chewed to bits, even though they are right at the front door. I've often looked out my window to see the deer right below it snacking away and staring at me. Needless to say, our landscaping is rather scrubby.Deer Off has worked so far. I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked. The container comes with a battery powered pump. The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work. The spray nozzle is slow and doesn't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well. But eventually it all worked.So I give the solution 5 stars and 3 stars for the dispenser. The solution is more important so I think buying it wins out."
4,Don't apply before a rain... and do NOT open inside!!!!!!,"WOW... the smell... will deter most critters straight away.... do NOT open this inside without expecting to fumigate yourself and do NOT apply before a rain to be effective.The active ingredients are Putrescent Whole Egg Solids (fermented rotten egg smell!), Capsaicin (hot peppers to deter nibbling), and Garlic (provides odor & nibbling deterrent) so think of highly rotten eggs with hot sauce and vampire deterrent LOL Yes, it'll work for it's intended purposes. There may be better and cheaper homemade treatments, but the battery powered trigger is really awesome and worth the price of the product if you spray many things and don't have/want to use a pressure/pump sprayer."
4,Easy to use ...,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season, and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets, since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead, it uses egg to make it smell like something dead, and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it, it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact, this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product, so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome, but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet, and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
3,Hard to say,"Hard to say really if it worked very well. Just as we applied it, they had a deer culling effort, so there were a lot fewer deer in the neighborhood. And we don't have too many rabbits or squirrels. The hawks killed them all off. So, not sure what to do with the rest of it. I guess I'll save it until the deer come back...so I can repel them :-)"
4,"Works great, sprayer is so easy to use",This works great keeping the deer and especially the rabbits out of our garden. It has also kept the rabbits from chewing on the new trees I planted in the late summer. The sprayer works great and it is battery powered. It makes it so easy to get this exactly where you want it without waste. I'd highly recommend for keeping deer and especially rabbits from the garden.
3,I must have stubborn deer!!,"I had high hopes for Deer Off repellent, especially since it is also supposed to keep away other animals such as rabbits and squirrels. It did seem to keep the rabbit away from my flowers and plants. However, the deer that come into my yard are either smarter than I am (very likely) or they are just not bothered by the smell. It didn't seem to keep the deer away at all. On a high note, I did notice less ""activity"" in my flower beds from the neighborhood cats that people refuse to keep inside their homes. That was defnitely an added bonus that I was not expecting.The smell is definitely not pleasant, but I don't think there is an animal deterrent spray that does smell good. I would like to rate this product better than 3 stars because it did help with the local rabbits and cats, but it didn't seem to do anything for the deer -- at least from what I can tell by the types/locations of flowers and plant that are still being used as midnight snacks."
3,"Will it drive squirrels away, or just nuts?","Well, I have seen some slight improvement about the grounds with this product, which is mostly garlic and cayenne pepper or some such goop. It seems to revolt the local cats, and that is a good start.While I'm no fan of bells-and-whistles spraying gizmos, this thing is practicable. I managed to spray the eaves of my house one calm day, and it seems the critters don't like it at all. This may even have helped me with my bird-nesting problems.Well, it is no different from similar types of stuff on the market, but I will await the coming Spring of 2013 to make an updated report."
2,Not effective,"Title says it all. Have used in our garden and deer still come and eat the plants. Problem may be that need to constantly reapply, especially after rain."
1,Kept my Garden Safe for 1 Day,I ordered this product in desperation. The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden. I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat. 1 day things were good then my peas disappeared. I am very disappointed.
2,Sprayer Worked Well But Limited Repellent Effectivess,"The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks, not the claimed three months, and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them. I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard. Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well. I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved."
1,Doesn't Work For Squirrels,"I sprayed ""Deer Off"" on and around our bird feeder and within a few hours the squirrels did not hesitate to have a feast with the bird seed I had just put in. Maybe this product works with deer (with which we've never had a problem) but it didn't work with the ""tree rodents"". Save your money !"
4,Works well,"I used this on our flowers and potted plants around our house, as the squirrels seem to love playing in them. I've only sprayed it on once and so far the squirrels have not bothered our flowers or potted plants since. I give this four stars because of the sprayer. You may not have to squeeze and get hand cramps, but the first time you use it, expect to wait several minutes of holding down the spray button before anything comes out. I'll take my chances with hand cramps in the future."
2,A disappointment,"The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use. Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing. Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds. Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver. Even then, when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry, NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers. I guess anything is better than starving. Ditto with the squirrels. They eat their way through the product to get to the food."
3,"havahart DO64 MS Deer OFF II Deer, ready to use repellent with battery powered sprayer","This product which is a deer repellent, as well as a repellent for rabbit and squirrel, is very effective if you spray it on your flowers and bushes during dry weather. We live in an area overrun by deer and we have tried many products without much effect. When I sprayed this on, the deer came around and left the bushes alone on which I had sprayed this product. The one problem I had with this product is that it came without several parts necessary for the sprayer to operate. What I did is get another sprayer and put the actual repellent in it, so I could at least test it to see how it worked. I gave this product a three star for that reason. I am not impressed with the sprayer, but if all the parts had been present,the sprayer might have worked and if the sprayer worked, I would have given it more stars. However, the repellent itself was very effective."
3,"Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer","Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer. This product is easy to attach the sprayer nozzle on to the container. The sprayer reached a good distance and got into small places that other containers are not able to reach. We have noticed a decrease in the squirrels around our wood piles and bird feeders. There are still several chipmucks. I applied this around our pool deck to deter the deer from eating my plantings. My flowers seem to be lasting longer now. There is no strong order or unpleasant smell."
1,Squirrel came back the very next day after spraying.,"I follow all of the instructions to the T (shaking well, etc.) but squirrel came back to my garden the very next day after spraying. It might be that Ohio squirrels are somehow different :) Live animal trap is next on my list of possible solutions."
1,Squirrels love it,"I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels. Well first of all, it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds. Then, when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least, the squirrels don't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell. Even my dogs don't seem to be bothered by the smell. In fact, they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs, I can't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but don't waste your money if you have squirrels. This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters."
2,There's a reason it isn't called Rabbit Off,"Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However, while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels, I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But, judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards, I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere, perimeter and main lawn, and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs, but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits, at least not the ones I have here in San Diego."
3,Peter Cottontail And His Friends Are Still Around,I do like the battery operated sprayer on this product though I think everyone should be warned that it takes more than a minute for the product to come out during the first time use. Even when it was running at full force it took quite awhile to cover a bush as the spray is quite weak. However for ease of use it is an improvement over several types of sprayers for other products I have used over the years.We have never had any deer in our area but rabbits and squirrels are plentiful and after using this product several times they are still around about as frequently as they ever were. Maybe this product would be more effective in the summer as the minimum temperature for applying this is 40 degrees F and it was in the low forties each time I made an application.
