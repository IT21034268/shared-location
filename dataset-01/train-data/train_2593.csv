4,Very good product; a little slow to arrive,"I ordered this for my sister in another state. When I was there visiting, I had trouble locating what she wanted -- a reacher with a magnetic tip -- all had suction cups. A medical supply company knew Duro-Med made one so I located it on the Internet when I returned to my home. It took a while to get to her - a week longer than the tracking indicated. When she received it, she said it was exactly what she needed."
4,Aluminum Reacher,A most helpful tool and a must for people that have trouble reaching. My only complaint is they do not offer a heavy duty model (string has a tendency to break - a light wire would be better.
4,Select the Right Size,"I'm 5'5"" and found the 26"" reacher too short for me; I have to stoop to use it. If you're my size or taller, I recommend the 32"".I like the product overall but find the knob at the top of the handle annoying. It's there so you can hang it, but the knob is uncomfortable in my hand."
1,there are two versions of this,"and I got the cheaper one. The one I got is not the same one as in the picture, and part of the grabber end is yellow compared to the black one pictured. The one I had before this one had stronger rope connecting the trigger to the claw, while this one has stretchier rope and only has a fraction of the gripping power that the old one had. The magnet is also a lot cheaper, as the old one had a neodymium magnet, while this one has a weaker magnet. So this explains some of the other one star reviews compared to some of the higher ratings."
1,Not Pleased,"If you want a reacher for VERY light duty, then this one is fine. I wanted it to use at the market and it is practically useless. It takes a lot of pressure to operate. Does not have a lot of capacity and is extremely light weight."
1,"It's a dropper, not a grabber","I ordered this because the picture looked nearly identical to the grabber my PT had given me (which I love), and I wanted to have a spare. Sadly, much like the other reviewers have mentioned, this is going in the trash. All of the ""grabber"" parts are hard, slippery plastic (the dreaded ""yellow tip"") instead of rubber coated like they should be. I've found very few things that can be safely lifted with this. Very disappointing, this product shouldn't even be sold; I feel sorry for other customers who have only bought this and might not realize there are some out there that actually work.I'm mystified by all of the positive reviews. Has there been a redesign that is being pawned off under the old listing?"
1,Not Worth The Money,This is to hard to use and hard to pick up anything. I don't like it and would not recommend this grabber to anyone. The magnet on the tip can't pick up anything.
3,semi satisfied,this item was not as good a quality as the one i already have. the pin on the end bends too easily
5,perfect,it is very great for me cause i am in a wheelchair and use a lot these .. they help me out with every thing in my daily life helps to dress and so on...
1,"Poorly designed, too slippery to grab items.","I had a reacher given to me at the hospital and needed a second one. I got this one since it was longer than my 26"" one and I didn't know the brand of my hospital's one.Although looking the same, this one is poorly designed: the string to move the hook is too long, the plastic hook is too slippery and doesn't apply any strength to grab items.I added some foam on both tips to get more friction and could grab light weight items.If you need a reacher, stay away from this and go for a Sammons Preston Reacher which has a rubber cover on the hook and foam on the opposite tip"
2,can't grab it!,"The jaw doesn't close all the way. It stops about a half inch before making contact. The string that pulls the jaws shut when you pull the handle is tied too long and the jaw doesn't make contact. Unfortunately retying the string or adjusting it is impossible.There is a number on the package that says DMI believes in 100% satisfaction. ""if for any reason you are not completely satisfied concerning your products assembly, use or maintenance, please call our Customer Care Help Line and speak to one of our friendly Customer Care specialists.""So a quick call to the 877-505-6190 Customer Care Help Line on the box - Now Briggs Healthcare, and you sit through a painful automated menu where they advise you that they will be charging you $ 9.99 to satisfy any and all warranty requests. There is nobody to talk to. You are required to leave your name and number and they say they will call you back in 24 hours or so.Product is made in China. Nobody answers the phone."
5,Great tool!,I needed something to extend my reach so I don't have to bend over as much due to lower back pains. This tool is exactly what I needed and it seems very durable.
4,Light & Functional,"Bought it for my granmother. Incredibly light and functional. At first it seems you won't be able to grab thins that would weight more than a couple of kilos, but it works well with everything up to, say, things weithing 10 or 15 kilos"
4,Excellent source reader,I use this text every year in my Adolescence class; I still have not found a more recent selection of readings that covers the appropriate topics with articles as interesting as the ones contained in this text.
4,Absorbing novel about female promiscuity and sexuality,"Having been caught in the trap of ""Oprah""esque novels, Lauren Porosoff Mitchell's debut novel was a ravenous read and a breath of fresh air. Her evocative prose brings to life Dana, a powerful sexual aggressor struggling with the vulnerability she feels when loving and trusting men. While Look at Me is not laden with action and suspense, it is an absorbing read that exposes the raw, unadultered side of female promiscuity."
1,Buy the Seventh Edition Instead,"This may just be me but I find the eighth and ninth editions of this manual totally nonsensical. Information seems to be given in some roundabout way that involves reading between the lines (ex. through the use of frequent stories) rather than simply using each chapter to explain a specific test, indications, and examples of its use.The seventh edition, on the other hand, is much more straightforward and clearly laid out. It was published in 1998 so I'm hoping that it still has some relevance to the field. The seventh edition is the manual that the PFT lab uses where I work."
4,"Great, well-rounded book","This book has everything you need to know about PFT's. As far as test taking, you have to sort the pertinent facts out from the extra details (extra, but good to know). Also, the RPFT exam has a little bit of questions touching on Pulmonary Rehab and Asthma education. This book doesn't cover those topics. But, in practice, Asthma ed and Pulm Rehab isn't quite the direct task of an RPFT.Take home message: great reference manual. Covers 95-98% of the material on the RPFT exam, but the RPFT exam only tests 85% of the material that's in the book. The other 15% is good to know anyway."
4,Ruppel 7th Edn,Agree with previous reviewers that it is a good text. We use it as a text for our undergraduate and postgraduate Respiratory Science programs at Charles Sturt University in Australia.Lost 1 star because it is a paperback with a cover that will not stay flat!
1,Students beware. Teachers stay away for curiculum use!,"This book is absolutely useless for students. The explanations are too complex, there are no explanations for the answers in the book and the Evolve resourse online has nothing to add. This book is not for acedemic learning at all, stay away!"
4,WRONG COVER ART,I love the original Disney classic.But this review is more of a head's up - the cover art is NOT accurate. It's from a completely different movie from 1992.
5,A great introduction to the genius and his idea,"I found this book charming and ""friendly"", especially for a person know very little about physics like me. It covers Einstein's life experience, how he developed his theories of relativity (I found this part relatively easy to understand), and his social life involvement - includes his view on politics, Jewish society and religions. Of course, putting all of these into a short book need to be extremely succinct, and yes, it is. The valuable illustrations made the reading much more enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
3,This Book Is Debunked,"I read Dershowitz's Case For Israel and originally was impressed. But upon further research I found Dershowitz claims of Israel outlawing torture in 1999 and that those protesting Israeli torture and human rights abuses, including Amnesty International, are bias and/or ignorant of the Israeli Supreme Court decision banning torture as dishonest. And upon reading a 2002 CBS News interview, (two years after the Israeli banning of torture and one year before this book was written) there was Dershowitz supporting torture! Then in reading Finkelstein's book, Beyond Chutzpah, I read three separate reports from three separate organizations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem, reporting excessive force and killings of unarmed civilians debunking Dershowitz and proving him as bias, dishonest and lacking credibility."
2,"Read Finkelstein's ""Beyond Chutzpah"" also","This is a well-written though highly debated text.It is very educational to read this text along side Norman Finkelstein's book ""Beyond Chutzpah"".Though Finkelstein is acutely demonized by Dershowitz, have a look for yourself and see who deserves that treatment.I heard a great quote about lawyers once:""The practice of law is take reality and describe it with words. Then lawyers argue about the words.""The reality of this issue grave. The justification for a created-by-declaration nation in 1948 that displaced a lot of people who now live in tents. ..and it's still not sorted out.Since the US sends $5B in aid to Israel every year and provides full military support, it behooves US citizens to understand this issue very well. Please read Finkelstein.Why two stars? The book is well written."
1,If you can defend a confirmed murderer you can write anything,"If you are willing to read more than 200 pages of Israeli apologetics based on nothing more than the writer's biased opinion without resort to historical fact or reason, then go ahead and read this book. For the more intelligent folks out there, do a bit more research on the author and his biases (read financial interests) before you waste $10."
5,Wow!!!!,"Sometimes I think that Alan Dershowitz must be the smartest man in America! He's so right when he talks about Israel's right to exist and the determination of its people to be tolerant of differences among themselves, which in many cases greatly outweigh differences between Arabs and Jews. Just look at what we're creating. Nobody can tell me that any Arab state treats its citizens as fairly as we treat Arabs in Israel, and in the so-called occupied territories."
1,Two wrongs don't make a right!,"Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial. Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris. Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue. Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen. Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time. Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine."
4,"One-sided, but interesting","Some of Dershowitz's arguments are weak, and he ignores or obscures some issues. He never directly confonts the issue of the settlements. Instead he frames the settlement discussion as if the only question is whether they are ""the greatest barrier to peace."" Sure it's easy to argue that the settlements, in some hyperlogical, technical sense, are not the greatest barrier to peace. But Dershowitz fails to address the moral problem of their existence.Nonetheless this is an interesting and worthwhile book in which Dershowitz does make some compelling points. Just don't let it be your only source of information on the subject."
5,"Lots of great arguments, quotes, and facts","I was aware of many of the arguments and facts, but there are also plenty new arguments that I had never heard and many of new facts and quotes that are just fantastic. This is a great and interesting read for anyone who wants the truth about Israel, and not just the arab spin countrol. ...Dershowitz points out the arab and liberal useful-idiot lies and distortions, and does so in an even-handed way."
1,Not at all convincing,"Inaccurate and tendentious throughout. For example, he writes ""historians believe that the Hebrews arrived in present-day Israel sometime in the second millennium B.C.E. Under Joshua, and later King David and his successors, independent Hebrew kingdoms existed."" In fact, no respected Christian, Jewish or secular historian argues that an independent Hebrew kingdom ever existed under Joshua. Not even the Bible claims that Joshua was a king or had a kingdom! We have no demographic data to support his claim that Jews formed the main part of the population for most of the sixteen hundred years between 1000 BCE and 636 CE.This cavalier disregard for truth and historical accuracy is typical. Dershowitz is after all a lawyer, not a scholar, trained to make the best possible case for his client, not to investigate the truth. Read instead Avi Shlaim's The Iron Wall."
1,not good,"Any apologist for zionism should read this book, It may give them some good ideas on how to defend the indefensible. Unfortunately for those of us not tainted by religeous loyalties, the game was up long ago on Israel. The continual evidence against this sad country is too strong to be deflected by a book like this.Some of the statistics have been proven to be wrong, some references also wrong. My favorite is on page 57 when he credits George Orwell with the term ""turn speak"", he means of coarse ""news speak""."
3,"Useful for campus debates, but nuance is sorely missing","There is nothing wrong with presenting one side of a debate with passion and intensity, and this is what Dershowitz has done in this useful handbook. It is digestible in easy, short chapters, and it will give Israel supporters useful information for arguing their side of the story. The book is not, however, a balanced reflection on Israel's successes and failures. It fails to describe the extent of the inequalities facing Arab citizens and generally comes up roses when the reality is more complex. So while I'd recommend this book for college students who encounter anti-Zionist zeal on their campuses, I'd point them elsewhere for a more thorough analysis of Israel's democratic experiment."
1,A recap of the medieval Crusades,"I don't know if it has been done, but it ought to be if it hasn't. I am talking about a book that would show how similar was the Zionist invasion of Palestine to the medieval Crusades when Christians also invaded and occupied the area of Palestine. Both were done by massive immigration, complete with arms to make war on the local people, and expel them from their homes and their land. The medieval Crusades were supported and financed by the Italian cities of Genoa and Venice and justified by Papal propaganda just as the Jewish community in the USA armed and financed and propagandized on behalf of the Zionists. The states created by the Crusaders (like Israel today) were repeatedly at war with the surrounding Arabs, as is Israel today. After two centuries of occupation the Arabs finally expelled the Christian invaders and recovered their land."
1,"These ""case"" isn't valid anymore","I'm sorry professor Dershowitz but The Case For Israel has been dismissed by reality: Israel is the oppressor and like all oppressors throughout history, it too will be overcome by the truth. The only way out for Israel is the two state solution, but even that is out of the question now because of the settlements in the west bank, and lack of political will (read: courage) in both Israel and the US to face reality in the face."
4,He's got it almost right.,"Dershowitz's succinct prose lays out the case for Israel in an organized fashion. His claim that Egypt and Jordan have accepted Israel is a case of wishful thinking. Egypt is the source of the most vicious anti-semitism, much of it originating in the tightly controlled official government press. Examples are a recent series on TV presenting the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and another 2 programs presenting the blood libel against the Jews, which was rejected by the Pope in the 12th century. He should have devoted more space to the biggest secret in recent Mid-East history ie the fact that one million Jews were driven out of their homes inArab and Moslem (Iran) countries since the establishment of Israel. Please take note you reviewers, who point out the ratio of Jews to Arabs in the Holy Land at the advent of the 20th century."
2,Hard reading,"Just couldn't get into it. To be truthful, I never read it, and probably never will, so it got lost in the shuffle."
1,more crap from the least moral lawyer in support of the least moral nation...,"As a Jew I am offended by the fallacies of this nonsense. To take it apart bit by bit would waste more time than I did reading this crap. Does this guy have any shame? Boycott this blow-hard and all of his hate toting nonsense. This is lies and ignorance, fear mongering and hatred."
1,a fabricated body of lies,"un-scholarly body of fabricated lies, quite easy to take into question its weak documentation. Read Professor Norman Finkelstein's ""beyond chutzpah"""
3,a controversial issue,The Isreal Palestine issue is comlex. Some people believe that isreal has a right to occupation in the middle east. Other people believe that the nation of Israel does not have such a right. this is definitely a complex situation and different people have different beliefs about it.
5,Balanced,"Regardless of what some say, this book is extremely balanced. I am a moderate supporter of Israel, and I must say that I was taken back by some of the accusations Dershowitz makes about Israel. I came away understanding arguments for and against Iraeli policy."
1,Zionist propaganda,"It's a shame Amazon doesn't allow zero star ratings.Throughout his 300 page islamophobic rant, Dershowitz leaves no lie untold and no scrap of history unfalsified. All you need to know about this foul piece of anti-Palestinian garbage is that its largely plagiarised from Joan Peters' book From Time Immemorial and entirely refuted by Norman Finkelstein (Beyond Chutzpah).People who believe a word of this book are simply Zionist doctrinaires who have no regard for historical accuracy and honesty."
5,Essential Reading on Israel,"Dershowitz enters the arab-israeli conflict with a masterpiece of a tome. For this, I will be forever in his gratitude. The Case for Israel is written in a no-nonsense, give-me-the-facts, style, and his case is more than just persuasive. His method is his strength - he divides the book into 'accusations' against Israel, and then proceeds to use the evidence to knock them down..and known them down totally. My only beef is that he could have put in more maps and diagrams...and hopefully, there will be a new edition sometime in the future that is even moredefinitive."
1,Another sorry PCAT book,"Listen, I just took the PCAT about an hour ago. This book is not good. Biology questions were not even close, chemistry questions were a little better, but not close. Worthless.The first review was probably someone selling books.Trust me. Bad."
1,Not worth the money,"The title on the front states that ""ARCO is the leader in test preparation"". If this is true I'd really hate to see all the other brands. This book led me to believe the practice questions presented would be similiar in content and form as the actual test. The only thing I saw similiar to the actual test was that the test was in a multiple choice format. I found the practice questions to be no where near the difficulty of the PCAT. The verbal ability part only gave example questions of antonyms and synonyms, leaving out analagies which is half of the verbal ability test."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"There is not need to buy this book. The practice section is the same as the one in the other Thomson book, PCAT success 2004, but atleast in that book you get a second practice test. I don't know how it will relate to the actual pcat yet, but it was a waste of my money."
2,Unbelievably poor design... especially for a design book.,"As someone who has had work published in several of David E. Carter's books, I appreciate his books for their value as a resource for designers and a way for those included in the books to promote themselves. But it always surprises me how poorly designed both the covers and interiors are, this book included. The covers are uninventive, dated, and unexciting, and the interiors are so crammed full of work that it's difficult to focus on any individual piece. There's just too much work featured in his books, and much of it of poor quality. I realize that if Carter were to ""trim the fat"", it might mean some of my work not getting into his next book. I'm fine with that -- would just like to see the quality of these books improved."
2,"For serious nibbling (don't laugh), get something nicer.","This nibbler has served me well, but it jams up frequently. Sometimes it bites off more than it can chew and then it can get to the point where you have to do some disassembly to remove the jammed metal niblets.If you only need it for really light duty metal or for a short project, go for it. Otherwise:My recommendation: buy a nicer one."
4,Nice Nibbler for Thin Metal,"I had and broke one of these attempting to nibble steel that was over 1/16 inch thick.I knew it was my fault - nibbles are not made for thick steel. I was surprised at how long it lasted in an abusive usage with me pressing as hard as I could before it finally broke. I bought two of these to replace the first one - That is how much I like these nibblers. They are great for aluminum or brass or for thin mild steel. They are not made for stainless steel, hardened or thick steel.The tip is small enough to fit into small places - Which is great!"
3,Priced Cheaply Enough To Get The Job Done,I use these with a modified front end and use them for fret tang nippers when fretting new guitar necks.
2,CHEAP!,"These are mass manufactured, and the cutting edge on these does not last too long. They are good for minor cuts, like aluminum. When it cuts, it will curl the edge, instead of a clean cut occasionally."
1,Broke less than one minute into use,"No durability. I unpacked it and used it for less than a minute before something came loose inside and jammed the cutting tip. I tried squeezing and tapping, but it became apparent that what was jamming it was some metal piece of the tool itself, not the metal I had been cutting. I tried to take it apart, but the front screw doesn't do much so the item is effectively dead. I had to use a pair of pliers to painfully finish the job that this nibbler was SUPPOSED to do. Cheap garbage. I got it instead of something more expensive like the Klein, thinking that I'd only need it once a year or so, but $12 for this garbage (including shipping) is very steep for 30 seconds of use. If I ever need another nibbler, I'm going with the Klein."
5,This Is Cool,my 2 kids have been enjoying this keep all the funny stuff up Dude! that is laughing they're underwear and pants off at the squirrel jokes episode they were throwing tomatoes at sandy cheeks when she was old and liquor the episodes are not yet because i have to tell you the numbers of the rating with the show 1 awful 2 poor 3 middle 4 good 5 excellentmermaid man and barnacle boy 4big pink loser 5opposite day 5squirrel jokes 2when you have tide and go seek there is more on the dvd than the vhs The One that i hate is Sponge Bob Sea Tales 5 episode rating 3 thank you all.
1,musical junk,makes a good coaster if you use the printed side up. when a drink gets wet it tends to slide around if you have the shiney side up.
2,The Uppercrust of Generic Rock,"Halfcocked's ""The Last Star"" is one of those cds that you debate on whether or not to keep it or trade it in. They have good qualities (infectious pop hooks, high energy rock riffs, palatable vocals) but they lack that true charisma or personality required to leave an impression. This release shows potential and promise but is elementary at best."
5,Simple Design But Effective,"This adjustable wire stripper can be quickly and easily adjusted to accommodate different gauges of wire. The mechanism for how this is done is very simple but effective: a screw can be positioned along a slot on one of the arms for making the necessary adjustments. Graduated markings on the other arm help take the guesswork out of making precise adjustments.The screw can be tightened or loosened by hand by turning the hex nut on the other side of the screw. Once tightened, the screw stays securely in place.The wire stripper is compact and lightweight. It is very durable - I've had mine for many years. Definitely recommended."
5,Great wire stripper,"Wire strippers are a problem for me, especially when I don't know the gauge. I tried this one to see if it would be useful and it is. You have to clamp down lightly and pull to strip the insulation off. If you clamp down too hard it will cut the wire. Takes a little practice. I would recommend it."
1,Leaks!!,"Decent camera, but not great. Shark mode is nice. Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water. Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week. Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present. Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera. Canon has some nice ones."
4,Great for Casual Divers,"Great camera for those who like to take pictures but are not trying too hard. Mine didn't leak at all, went down to up to 100', just make sure you follow instructions. Clean it properly and watch out for the O-ring. Cons:- adjusting the exposure and macro; mine came out blurry or way over exposed even in sea mode but I figured that was also due to lighting, so buying the flash with this would probably make the pictures come out better- remember to switch to ""take pictures""! I missed taking pictures of sharks, turtles, octopus (all in one dive) because I hadn't put it in picture taking mode.The spy mode is pretty amazing as well, learn how to use it and it can give you great pictures. You can also take normal pictures on land since it's a digital inside a case, colors are sometimes off and exposure was my main problem.Still pretty amazing though, I definitely don't regret buying this."
2,"Good case, below average camera","I've had this camera about a year, and must say the case is pretty nice. No complaints with it at all. I know 4 other divers with the same camera and they like it. The camera itself takes horribly grainy pictures, nowhere near as good as a real canon or nikon pocket-sized camera. My battery was also shot after a year. You can tell the camera is cheaply made just by holding it - it's all cheap plastic. The case is pretty rugged though. To do it again, I'd get a case for my Canon 850 IS."
1,Flakey Author,"This book is absolutely hogwash. I can't believe that anyone would buy this stuff. Nothing in his book is scientifically backed up or thouroughly researched and this is all based on speculation. It was a TRUE dissapointment when I purchased it.Hopefully Mr.Robert D. Gidel will slip on his soap in the shower and fall on his big bum.HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAahahahahI'm sorry my Gidel. I just randomly picked a book and then wrote this review. I'm sure it is a good book.:)Best Wishes with the sales.Sincerley, mz.mean_reviewer"
4,Nice Contemporary Romance,"""Baby,Baby"" is a nice comtemporary romance set against glamous Hollywood. Ms. Adams is able to come up with some snappy and quick dialogue with references recent Hollywood scandels. The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that it seem to end to quickly. But, if you are looking for a book for plane or car ride, check out ""Baby,Baby"""
1,Lousy book...,"Baby, Baby is full of self-centered, self-serving characters and mediocre dialogue. Don't waste your money."
3,"Too awkward to engage the reader, though intriguing","The plots and characters in this book are awkward and unbelievableenough to seriously weaken the book, no matter how many interestingdetails Yehoshua weaves in. I could not maintain sympathy for thecharacters because I couldn't make sense of their actions either inthe context (as much as I could imagine) of their age or in light ofour own."
4,medieval realism,"What reeks, what is fragrant, and what simply smells unpleasant are graphically presented, if that is possible. Sleep habits of the characters-- their movements and sounds -- are also described. The brightest of yellows, reds, magentas seem even brighter when contasted with the grey rainy skies and black robes of medieval Jews.How does Yehoshua do it? The result is a particularly intense reality. ."
1,"Overpriced Pamplet, How to throw five pitches on (50) pages?","I have been playing, coaching girls softball for over 25 years. I purchased this book with the intent to help girls pitch softball, hoping to get ideas on drills, practice etc. I guess, I was expecting more when I received less. In my opinion, it could of took less time to write than to read, (within the hour). If you're wealthy and wanting to spend a lot of money on terms, than this pamplet may be for you, If your looking for specifics and details, and a good buy. Search elsewhere....."
1,This book will do little to advance beginners,"This is an over priced pamplet that will do little to ""teach"" someone to begin to pitch. I have been involved in ASA softball for 8 years and, my daughter has been pitching for 2 years now. I bought this book to try to teach her different pitches. The book lacks a glossery to define some of her terms. In addition sequential drawings or photos would be very helpful to show what is trying to be explained. The book frequently references you to other chapters to try to explain what the current chapter is trying to explain. (example when attempting to understand what is being explained in ""The Change Up"" the sub heading ""Feet"" says ""you should have the same feet positions as in other pitches"" Say what????, which other pitches, why not type another two or three lines to explain it in this chapter. This happens repeatedly throughout this book (Pamplet)Save your money and invest in a trainer."
1,Incorrect Pitching Mechanics,"Compared to all other books and videos, Mr. Ford teaches a different set of mechanics. Since all others are different I must assume that Mr. Ford is incorrect and teaching it wrong. There are only a few pictures to demonstrate what he is writing about and this book is NOT recommended for starting pitchers. ANY other book or video would be better."
5,Timeless Classic!,"Even though this book is forty years old, its truths are still fresh and relevant. Sanders here provides an extremely helpful resource for anyone in a church leadership position, especially the position of pastor or deacon. I'm considering getting copies of this title for all the deacons in my congregation, and recommending it to all the young, aspiring pastors I know.This book should be on the shelf of every pastor and deacon. I haven't read anything else that compares to it."
5,Sound Godly Wisdom!,"I've read several books on Spiritual Leadership, but none maintained that consistent focus on God's pattern of leadership, as this book did. This work is a classic, one of those books that you don't simply read but infuse in your walk with God. The Godly wisdom of J. Oswald Sanders is evident in every page. If I was a pastor I would make this book required reading for all ministers in the church. Whatever stage of ministry you may be in, this book will address the issues. If you desire to be an effective servant for the Lord, I highly recommend this book! Make sure you read the the Editor's Preface, it will help you understand the era in which Oswald spoke these truths."
5,"If the Holy Spirit isn't Guiding it, God's not Buying it","Jesus left this earth for our benefit, so that we may receive the Spirit of God. Spiritual Leadership gives the characteristics a Godly leader must have. This world gives praise to those who make it to the top by being confident, but this books gives illustration to the people God will be praising by who makes it to the bottom. Christ said, ""If you want to be first, you must be last."" A spiritual leader has a willing heart to serve the flock that he is apart of by the sacrificing of him or herself in humility.Be encouraged by this book if you are in a place of spiritual leadership that God has you there for a reason. You might not be qualified yet, but God doesn't send the qualified, he qualifies the sent."
5,A Must for Spiritual Leaders,Spiritual Leadership by J. Oswald Sanders is an awesome book and a must read for anyone in a position of spiritual leadership! Highly recommended.
4,Good book,"Some solid points in the book. Sometimes seems to meander, expanding topics unnecessarily. The first few chapters are more introductory and hint at what is in the rest of the book."
1,The 2007 Edition Written by Moody Editors NOT J Oswald Sanders,"I was extremely disappointed to learn that this 2007 edition was so significantly edited by Moody.The preface says it all. ""Our purpose was to revise Spiritual Leadership for Christians living in the twenty-first century ... Perhaps Sanders meant his references to 'man', to 'men', to 'him' and to 'his' to mean all people without respect to gender. It was common in his era to use masculine pronouns as a generic reference to everybody. But perhaps he did not."" The editors also made other changes to the point while reading the text one must wonder the original intent of the author.I exchanged my copy for the 1994 edition which is the classic that Sanders actually wrote in the 1960's."
4,Spiritual Leadership: Principles of Excellence for Every Believer,Very bibical and helpful. It is will help new and season leaders keep there focus on God.
5,Excellent,Spiritual Leadership is an excellent book with a great study guide for individuals or groups. Sanders makes you take a look at yourself and evaluate where you are in your walk with God. If you want to grow in Spiritual Leadership then this book is for you!
3,Toughen up!,"I have found this book to be a bit on the 'tough' side, making leadership out to be more tough and hazardous, rather than rewarding. It's akin to the drill sergeant telling you how tough life will become for you if you choose this route. It's not the most encouraging, uplifting reading I've ever encountered.However, it does offer many excellent perspectives on leadership from those who have been in the trenches and on the mountaintops. Many of these perspectives differ greatly from each other, which makes for a great compilation on Christian leadership."
5,Principles of Leadership,This book provides basic tools for the knowledge and usage towards leadership qualities.
2,Needs a book/manual,If I had taken the time to read the description I would have realized this is a CD with templates. I was looking for a book on college/univeristy emergency planning/management. I'll use the CD but I would have preferred a book that explained college emergency management. There are many plans online that I could have used to create a plan.
5,The Shining Cloth,"I loved this book! It immediately went to a prime spot in my textile library. I was thrilled when it came out, and as I am a textile collector and dealer, I find that it fills a niche that no other book yet has. The information is quite extensive and well researched. It has been very helpful in my quest for more knowledge about certain areas of world textiles. At the same time, it has introduced many new concepts and relationships that I have found not only useful, but very exciting and inspiring. I find the quality of the photographs and the layout to be very beautiful and visually stimulating, seeming to reflect the author's enthusiasm for her subject. I find this book an indispensible part of my library of textile books, and think anyone from beginner to professional will find an abundance of riches to enjoy in this book! Kudos Ms. Rivers!"
1,False Pretense,"I find this material to be more of a soapbox for the author to launch into tirades and attacks against Christianity and Christians using misinformation, skewed factoids and blatant lies and deceptions concerning Christianity and Christians, while promoting her own biased religious support for shamanism, Hinduism and various other religions under the false pretense of writing a book on ""cloth""."
3,Not like picture,"Cool shirt. It is a conversation piece. It is just not the exact shirt in the picture. A slightly different image of the bell, and worst of all it also has the Bad News Bears logo on the bottom from the recent movie. That takes away from the look tremendously."
1,Only 1 star because I can't give them 0,"I bought a pair of these elsewhere and will be returning them after less than 24 hours. None of the three sizes of ear gels fit securely. The over the ear loops did no good whatsoever. The ""tangle resistant"" cord was just stiff and awkward, contributing to the difficulty with keeping the blessed things in my ears."
3,Backup Is Difficult To Configure,"I bought Dantz Retrospect 7 Professional Upgrade because I wanted to be able to schedule reoutine maintenances. I thought I set it up but never got a backup except the first trial. The software does not list my Maxtor One Touch Drive as a backup device. You have to go to a ""run"" tab to run it. You can configure a macro to have it run with the One Touch Button, or at least it says that I have yet to get it to work. It is not usuer friendly as I have considerable software experience."
3,"Not bad, but spins a bit fast.","I bought this to display a model for a show, but the thing rotates a lot more rapidly than I expected. Since I had put LED lights in the model it looks like a party light spinning, with no time to really take in the details of the piece.Not bad for the price, just need to figure out a way to slow it down if I want to use it."
1,Crunch,"I bought this item in the high hopes to display my car in it's full and complete glory, to impress my friends and maybe find one of the female persuasion. All my hopes were dashed when I parked my little red car on top of it... the entire thing was utterly crushed beyond recognition! I mean totally destroyed! CRUNCH! I broke it! I'm not much of a mechanic, or artiest. So I naturally assumed it was my fault. So I ordered another to try again before my big party. And blammo! My wee pride and joy totally pulverized the thing. CRUNCH! Good thing no one showed up to my party or I would have completely embarrassed. I'm sure I had read the instructions properly. My third one is currently sitting here in it's box. My car is idling outside. I fear I may fail again. As I do. At everything. Sigh."
4,Great for remodel,"I got this as a freebie when I bought the Porter-Cable CFFN250N Finish & Brad Nailer Combo Kit on a promo a few months ago. The saw worked great for tearing out a big part of my house to be remodeled, including nails, drywall, studs, etc.. I did have a little trouble with the blades and allen wrench at first (mostly just trying to keep track of the wrench), but now have things all figured out and it works great."
2,Are you sure it is what you want?,The saw does not come with a case and you have to use a allen wrench to change the blades. For a little more money you could get a saw with a case and quick release to change the blades.
5,awsome!!!,"shipping, to quick to be true. Item was exactily as described. Could'nt ask for better service."
4,"So far, so good!","We've owned this saw for 2 years now, it's held up to frequent, hard use very well. It's cut through tree limbs, metal poles and pipes, and other miscellaneous hard substrates. Comfortable to use and Dewalt provides 10 blades (5 wood, 5 metal) along with this package, which have also held up well. My only complaint is the finicky little tightener bolt used for securing the blade in place- it's a bit tedious to change blades. But overall we're quite happy with this do-it-all saw."
3,Versions Of Models,"The Pictures Here Uploaded By Hugo Are of A Different Model A 303M With Quick Release Blades.I Own The Original, And It Is Difficult To Get The Blades Out Sometimes.This Version Is A 6 amps, Dewalt No longer Sells This Model, There Current Version A 303MB And Is 9 AmpsNone the less I have cutup allot of things with my original and is very handy.1. Cutting Up Bones For The Dogs2. Tree Branches3. House Hold Items So They Fit Into A Trash Bag Or My Trash Collector Will Leave It Setting On The Curb.4. My Satellite Dish Because Direct TV Kept Raising There Rates."
4,Excellent manga,"volume 5 of this entertaining series has various short stories with 3 long stories. The short stories are like parables, with a revelation at the end of each tale.The longer stories include one about an old jitte (policeman) who goes all out to take credit for his efforts in order to cling on to his post, the training of a young jitte by Asaemon and a last sexploitative story about a woman who gets herself impregnated in order to delay her execution. Sexploitative because it is clearly meant to titillate. I think that the reason that these stories did so well back then was that they were aimed at the largely pubescent male population in Japan."
3,Frustrating!,Excellent text. Precise annotations. Comprehensive bibliography. But no index. This omission is sure to frustrate any researcher who intends the book as a reference source.
2,BUY WITH WHEELS,TOO MUCH WORK TO ASSEMBLE THIS THE TRUNK NEEDS PUNCH OUT HOLES TO MAKE INSTALLATION EASIER.YOU NEED A LONG 6 INCH DRILL BIT THAT IS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN 1/2 INCH TO DO THIS JOB.KEEPING THE TRUNK SQUARE IS DIFFICULT SINCE THE BEST WAY TO DRILL IN WITH IT ON ITS SHORT END.I RECOMMEND BUYING THE WHEELED TRUNK INSTEAD.
4,a GREAT ALBUM!,"I bought this album because of the Rational Youth song ""money and blood"". But I was positively suprised by the other artists on this album.This is a collection of great artists in the electronic music genre. so KINETIC ART is ELECTRONIC ART!!"
3,vestidas y alborotadas movie,"I was watching the movie, but it did not had an ending, it was cut off, I tried it on other dvd player but it was the same, the ending was cut off, I was a little dissapointed."
3,too tight,"I love these colors and wear them with a long shirt, but they are not made for someone with a booty. They pull at the zipper. I am usually a sz 0 and these are sz 3, so I am sure I didn't buy too small."
2,bad design,"When you install these on your glasses, there is a metal bar that rests directly on the front of the lenses, which will inevitably scratch the lenses. I ended up breaking the metal bars off. If you look at the picture that Amazon shows for this product, it looks like somebody has edited out or broken off the bar on the left side, but the bar on the right it still there."
5,Great option,My husband wears prescription glasses and these provide him with the perfect tint to drive and for outdoors. He enjoys them. This is the second pair we got for him because his lenses were changed (shape). Great buy!
4,"For a private-eye, Stamp delivers!","Jack Stamp outdoes himself in this delightful anthology of musical achievement. At the end, however, I found myself yearning. When will Mr. Stamp realize that fighting crime and musicology just don't mix? His music is wonderful-- especially the gripping Gavorkna Fanfare-- but his calling is detective work. But until he realizes this, I suppose we shall continue to expect more wind ensemble music of this calibre. There are worse fates."
1,THIS SONG SUCKS!,I played this song and it haunts my sleep. This is the single worst song written in the galaxy! DOn't spend money on this! Don't play it at all! Run away!
5,A POSTMODERN MASTERPIECE,"Please, ignore the ignorant fool who gave this album a one-star review. Some people will never know good art when they experience it, and his not understanding this album will forever be his loss.The truth of the matter is that this is a classic, modern day work of art that music historians will surely be discussing for many years to come. It's a fascinating glimpse into the high's and low's of an everyman and ranks up there with some of the best work from Blind Willie Johnson and Leadbelly. Rarely have I been as moved as when I listened to Too Old To Truck Anymore or How'd I Get This Way.Accept no cheap Buck Truck imitations (such as the newest works from Buck 65) and do yourself a favor and buy this album while you still have the chance!"
4,Story of the Search for a Theory of Everything,"Interesting and entertaining, but rather focused on explaining how the search for the Theory of Everything developed through the years."
4,Excellent,"This is a great book for someone who has some understanding of physics, but it is not a requirement to enjoy it. Lots to learn!"
2,Disappointing,"Yeah this may be historically significant, but for learning purposes the limitations of an old vhs-to-dvd production are obvious. Stu Hamm is a great artist, but check out other material first if you're looking for study material instead of a ""film"" that you just wish to watch from start to finish. It does contain practice sessions with notation on screen, but image quality is poor, and there is no notation or other material that you could print."
3,Five excellent songs by The Iguanas...,"Includes five excellent songs by The Iguanas, two originals and three nicely done covers...Come A Little Bit Closer, Crimson and Clover and Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You. The rest is movie instrumental music done by Mark Mothersbaugh. Iguanas - * * * * ; Mothersbaugh - * 1/2"
5,Classic Robinson,"Is there no end to the enjoyment that Peter Robinson provides.?The interpolation of an old case with a new case is brilliant.I really enjoy the sojourns into Bank's personal life. I rate Robinson's Banks books right up there with Ian Rankin's Rebus books.Every time I finish a Robinson book , I find myself lamenting the fact that I have to wait another year for his next."
4,Robinson never disappoints,"While the pace of the latest DCI Banks mystery was somewhat slower than previous installments, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Piece of My Heart."" The parallel mysteries provided Robinson an opportunity to explore what he does best - character development. Unlike other reviewers, I was not at all confused by the switchovers between present-day and the 1969 narrative. At one point, Robinson conveys through Banks' character that the past always comes back, and it reminded me that this is a recurrent theme in the series, and one reason why I enjoy reading Peter Robinson. 4 1/2 stars."
3,A readable tale,Interesting but takes a long time to develop its themes. Kept looking for more depth of character or extension by introducing interesting characters. The setting is interesting.
3,Solid Installment,"Robinson goes back to the premise he used in his earlier novel ""In a Dry Season"", moving back and forth in time between the present and the time of a long unsolved murder (although I don't believe he pulled it off as well this time).In this book, the long unsolved murder occurred during a ""Woodstock"" like music festival in the late 1960s. In the present day, a journalist researching a band that played at the festival is murdered. This leads to a re-opening of the earlier investigation.As I said in my title, this is a solid installment by Robinson, but not his best. I actually enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book quite well, but the ending is somewhat unsatisfying. A slight ""thumbs up""."
5,Another masterpiece,"Peter Robinson is one of those preciously rare authors with the power to both thrill and touch our hearts. His characters are only too human, real people trying to make the best of the imperfect world we all populate.Two murders, one from 1969, the other from 2005 slowly, after hard investigation connect.Chief inspector Banks ( after late Morse, my favorite fictional character),is not a tough, macho detective or a dissipated wreck of a human being as in many cliche novels written these days. He is a normal, somewhat lonely and troubled middle-aged man with a clear passion fo justice and truth. Reading Mr. Robinson's beautiful books means an honor to be part of his touching fictional world for as long as the pages go through our hands."
5,Introduction of Detective Inspector Gervaise,"Against well-intentioned advice, I'm reading this series backwards although I'm now also catching the early volumes.Be that as it may, I especially enjoyed the introduction of Detective Inspector Gervaise and the reaction of Inspectors Banks and Cabbot to their new superior.The story is great, alternating between two cases separated in time by some 35 years, but of course interconnected although the reader realizes one common factor and may guess the key common factor early in the book. We see considerable contrast in adult reactions to the 60's and rock and roll at the time and in our time. We also see contrasts in relationships between two strict fathers and their venturesome daughters and that between the more liberal Bank and his son.All in all, I do consider this to be one of Peter Robinson's best novels and recommend it highly."
4,"Hippies, Rock bands, Drugs, and Murder","The novel covers two cases, the first the murder of a young woman at an outdoor rock music event in 1969, and the second a young male writer working on a novel in 2005. As first the cases seem separate, but then links develop as Banks and his assistants investigate.The main problem I had was with the structure of the novel, i.e., a few pages in 2005, then a few in 1969, a few more in 2005, then back to 1969, etc. They are not really flashbacks, but an intermixing of the two cases that make it hard to concentrate on the plot. I finally skimmed through, ignoring 2005 until I was finished with 1969, then went back and read the 2005 sections.There are some side issues about various people's attitudes, and contrasts between time periods. Kev Templeton does not come across well in this novel; and Banks has a new supervisor, an ambitious woman who views herself as a new broom."
4,Nice 4-prong T-nut,"This T-nut has 4 prongs instead of the usual 3 prongs and should be more secure despite vibration, motion etc which could cause the nut to loosen from the surrounding wood. Material appears to be zinc coated so if exposed to moisture it will eventually rust although since a T-nut is hidden it probably doesn't matter.Dimensions:The nut accepts a 1/4-20 threaded screw and the threaded hole is 5/16"" long. The entire length of the T-nut is 23/64"" long from thread entrance to back of the T-nut.If you need something REALLY secure then take a look atIMPERIAL 6213 SIX PRONG T-NUT 1/4-20 PKG/25which has 6 prongs although I think this might be overkill for most uses."
3,Only okay,"From the two of the same brand and model that I bought, one works great while the other at times does not squeegee well."
4,GSR2,I use the GSR2 as part of an overall relaxation program during counseling. It's super easy to use and the CD is very helpful.
2,Biofeedback,product came on time and undamaged. Just wasn't what I had hoped it would be. The finger pads seem to me very sensitive and you need to get your fingers just in the right spot to make it work.
1,Way over-priced,Many years ago I got a GSR at Radio Shack for maybe 12 bucks. Worked great. If you search the web there are instructions for building your own.
4,Comprehensive to say the least,"This book is fascinating, New York City is so blessed with amazing buildings, and this book is about as thorough as you can get. I found the synopsis of each building quite interesting, I mean the author could not exactly go indepth on each building, but he gave just enough for you to understand the significance in its inclusion. The B&W photos are nice and I appreciate that every building covered comes with requisite photo, that is so important in books of this type, no matter how well a building is discribed it just can rarely compare with an actual image. I recommend this book to anyone with any interst in New York or just fine buildings."
3,For Family,"I only got this game so I could play with my brothers. Their computers are too slow for anything else or I'd rather play something more recent, garaunteed."
5,Finally back to a great game!,"I've been sick of these modern day games that put you in the same fighting every time. Very controlled and cramped maps with the same game play experience every time. When I try out a new game and play their ""large"" maps I'm constantly disappointed by how small they are really are. This game has spoiled me by immersing me into a world that has the open feeling of an mmo. After playing this game you get to experience a freer environment to kick some enemy tail in, every game experience is different from the last with the expansive game play you'll find in Joint Ops. Why any other company would ignore such great accomplishments this 2005 game made is beyond me."
5,Great FPS game,"Even after several years, this game is the game I return to again and again after finishing the 'other' FPS games. The gameplay is the thing here, It may not have the 'eye candy' of the newer games, but this is fun. With up to 150 players in a single game, 100's of fan created/customizable maps/mods and a large fan base this game never gets old for me. I have given this game to several of my friends and we play all the time."
1,Worthless!,"This shredder struggles with anything 3/4"" thick and will start to choke on almost anything that approaches 1"". The slots to insert the brush are so restrictive that you need to manicure the branches before they will fit into the hopper. The exit chute is such a radical turn that unless everthing is bone dry, it sticks and clogs up causing the machine to stall. I think I spent more time pulling this apart and cleaning it out than actually using it. I'm going to try and return it as it is useless unless you want to shred popsicle sticks or chop a salad. Maybe it would be better to forget the salad as it may be too ""wet"" to chop without clogging."
5,Pushing the Limits - a super Canadian mountaineering book,"This book is a joy to read and a ""must have"" as a reference book that tells you all you would like to know and more about the history of mountaineering in Canada. Beautifully published with many pictures of the ""greats and near greats"" of the Canadian mountaineering scene since it all began in the mid 1800's. Chic Scott has produced a book that has already become a classic in mountain literature."
5,"Gorgeous, gorgeous outdoor light, at a fantastic price! Worth every penny!","I bought this fixture as a replacement for my ugly 70's porch hanging lamp. When it arrived, it was MUCH bigger than I expected! When it says 32"" in the description, that means the actual fixture from the bottom of the glass to the part where the chain connects is about 32"". HUGE! And then there's a 3 foot chain.My husband hung it for me and said it was a little bit more complicated than the usual fixture (and he used to be an electrician, so he knows). It required some assembly, but I did all that without looking at the instructions just fine. Took maybe 30 minutes, start to finish, so not bad.The description also says it takes 3 B-10 bulbs, but please note that it actually takes 6.Overall, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous fixture. My mom thought I had spent about $150 on it, and about died when I told her how much I paid! So, so, so worth the $14 dollars!See my porch pictures above!"
3,"Good character study, but not a great mystery","The book starts out in 1994 with the obituary notice of a 104-year-old woman, who was best known as the last person who might have known the reasons for an apparent murder/suicide that took place in 1955. The victims were Georgina and Edmund Lomax, along with their servant, Ada Pepper.The rest of the story is told in the words of Georgina, Edmund, and Ada in alternating chapters. They tell their life story up to the event that took their lives. The mystery is solved for us.People interested in a novel of mystery or suspense, may find themselves disappointed in this one. It is well written, but moves slowly in some parts. As the narrative unfolds, most people can guess the motives involved in the characters' deaths. It is really more of an interesting character study, than a mystery. I gave it 3 stars, because, while most of the book grabbed me, I found myself skimming the pages and wanting to get to the end about three fourths of the way through."
1,A Little Death,"After reading glowing reviews of this book I bought it, only to be very disappointed. I found it tedious and drawn out to the point of boredom. By the time I plowed through to the end, I didn't care what became of any of the characters. I feel certain that Ms. Wilson will write more interesting books in future."
4,"Well written, but ...","I must agree with the other people that reviewed this book. It is extremely well written, and the flow of words makes it easy to read. But, there reached a point in the book where it got harder to read due to the content. All families have secrets - don't get me wrong - but when someone refers to Incest as ""perfect love"", it is wrong. I don't care if it is a work of fiction, knowing that Georgina and Edmund were lovers was very disturbing to me, and a very deviant twist to an otherwise stellar mystery. I enjoyed 90% of the book, but I hesitate to read her newer book ""Dying Voices"" because I don't think that I could stomach another book where incest is a ""plot twist""."
4,OK,"Read a lot of Parker, and wished that the that publishing Guerrero would publish the last Jesse Stone as an e-book."
2,Perpetua story not for kids,"This video is about a significant story in Christian history, but its subject matter makes it unacceptable for children to view. In no way is it okay for kids to watch martyrs being mauled and killed by wild animals, even if their souls are wafted off to heaven in the next scene. What were the filmmakers thinking?"
5,A joy to read,"Stephanie Clement has done an excellent job putting together a book on vocation in the horoscope. The writing is clear and understandable, and the organization of the book is superb. I have been studying vocational astrology for many years and have written the text for a computer report on vocational astrology for Halloran Software. Stephanie Clement has written a fine book on career in the horoscope. She illustrates her points with case examples. I highly recommend this text for any astrologer interested in the influence of the stars on one's career."
3,Technically...it works.,For some reason I can't leave the paper shredder on the automatic setting. It continuously runs instead of just running when you insert paper into the feeder. I'm not sure if there is a small piece of paper stuck in the blades but I have to insert the paper only on the left side for it to shred. It won't go in the right side so I have to tear everything in half before I feed it through. Like I said...technically the product works...just not to my satisfaction. It wasn't worth returning b/c I don't use it that much.
3,Delivers for the price,"I purchased this shredder about a year ago as a replacement for the type that did not have its own basket. I agree with the other reviewers that the basket fills up too quickly but for the price it is reasonable. However, it jams very easily when shredding credit cards either real or the plastic advertisment type. Last night it jammed so badly I can't get it fixed so I will upgrade to a little better model. Overall, I was not disapponted with this model for the money and the convenience of having an attached basket."
3,Aurora AS618SB 6 Sheet Strip Cut Paper Shredder with Basket,Aurora AS618SB 6 Sheet Strip Cut Paper Shredder with Basket. Pretty good product for the cost. Discovered it will jam with less than 6 sheets of standard size copy paper as well as some envelopes. Do not try to shred any heavy weight papers or it will jam.
4,Great value for the price,"This shredder works well. My only issue is that periodically you have to push the shredded paper down in the basket, otherwise it will stack up and stop you from shredding. But hey, for 17 bucks, I am ok with that."
2,Disapointed,"This is a good shredder but don't expect much from it. I been using this for a year now, and it gets jammed and overheats quite often. You get what you pay for. Keep shopping around for a better shredder, though its cheap in the long run a better one will save you money."
3,It's A Shredder...,"There really isn't much to say about a shredder as basic as this. It's strip cut, it's noisy, and the basket is way too small. But, it shreds, so it does the job well. Can't ask for much more, especially for the price."
1,Wish I could give it a zero star review,"This thing is the biggest piece of junk ever. We've had nothing but problems with it since the day we got it. Will jam up comstantly and then will quit working for no reason. The last time I used it it was fine, went to use it again after a couple of months and now it won't turn on at all. I've looked for jams and there isn't anything in it. Total junk. Wish I still had the box & paperwork but alas I guess I'm stuck with it."
1,Not very effective,"If you want something that actually obscures information, don't bother with this. It basically cuts paper into 1/4 inch strips, and obviously that can easily be pieced back together. Go for a shredder that tears up the strips as it's cutting them. This is too expensive for what it does... on the bright side, it is about the right size that a standard grocery bag can be used to catch waste in the basket."
2,OK for the price,It only takes 6 sheets at a time (which is pushing it) and it just cuts into strips (not small pieces). Even just putting 1 sheet in at a time it tends to go crooked and jam.
3,Aurora Paper Shredder,"The price is reasonable. When it is functioning it is fine. I have been problems the ""auto"" part, the actual shredding function, being erratic.The central part, which activates shredding, is easily clogged up and I need to clean it out often. I am actually considering sending it back to the maker at this time."
2,unhappy,"I have to say the shredder is not a right one for me. It sucks all the time. And it smells badly after using for a while. Totally unhappy. What I can say? It is a cheap one, so you may not expect too much!"
3,You Get What you pay for,Nice small shredder. Does not cross cut! I place mine by the door to shredded the junk mail as it comes in the house but wish I would have spend a little more and gotten a bigger shredder. Have to empty every other day and it jams up easly.
4,super review,I wanted a shredder to take care of all the junk email from credit card companies. This shredder takes care of those. I also use it for bank statements and the like. If you are going to do a lot of shredding you might find this model's basket is on the small side. Other than that it worked fine for me.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a horrible product. It works fine for the first 5-10 sheets... then it just starts jamming left and right. I spend more time trying to get chunks of paper out than I do actually shredding. It claims it can handle 6 sheets... this is NOT true. Maybe 2 sheets, but no way it can handle 6.Do not waste your money, but something different."
3,Satisfactory,"First time I used this, I had a few jams but nothing too bad. Excellent product for the price point."
1,Not for beginners,"As an AutoCAD 2000 and AutoCAD LT 2000 instructor, I found Randy's books to be too difficult for entry level students. The methods are hard to understand and follow for first time AutoCAD students. This leads to confusion in the classroom and makes the software seem harder to learn than it is. Some of the graphics in the books are so pixelized the studens can't figure out what they are. There is no solution manuals available either."
4,Inexpensive and overall good product,"I received a case of 100 of these and not a single one was cracked or broken. While they are not the ""heavier"" CD cases that one might get from a store purchased CD, they do the job and well. I would certainly buy these again."
3,Americopy 100 Standard Black CD Jewel Case,Jewel cases are as described and ok value for the money. Packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Was not packed with enough filler so several were damaged in shipment. Wish they would pack better
5,Not just for CD's,I purchased the cd cases for my rubber stamps. I am converting the rubber stamps from blocks to acrylic and the cases are the correct size and take up so little room. It was difficult to find the regular cases. Thank you
3,"Hard to rate a generic product, but.....","The source manufacturer for this generic product(100 standard CD jewel boxes) will vary depending on which dealer you buy it from. I purchased from ""The Recording Store"", and found the quality of the product to be fair to middling. I got 95 intact boxes out of the 100 box shipment.(the remaining componenents were shattered). That may be par for the course in shipping product such as this. As for the quality of the 95 boxes, it can be best described as ""fair"". Because of less than precise molding of the disc trays, some did not fit snugly into the transparent rear component. Yes, the price is great, but you get what you pay for."
3,"It functions, but is not quite right.","I have purchased and used many standard jewel cases, but this is the first time I've encountered a case wherein the insert piece (that fits into the clear plastic outer case) is not quite the correct size. It is just a little to small, and one corner of the insert tends to fall out every time you open the case. Other than that little annoyance, it functions as it should."
5,Sandard Jewel Case,"I was very pleased to find this item on-line, as this type of case has disappeared from vendors shelves. It's an exact replacement for my standard case, which I wanted because I use them to record music and need the ability to put a title on the end of the case, which I can't do with the ""slim"" cases. I found the quality to be good and the price very reasonable. Next time I need cases, I'll reorder these."
2,Travel size,"I purchased this game for my grandson because I remembered how much I loved playing it myself as a child. I was disappointed when I received it and found out that it was more or less a travel sized version of the one I used to have. It's not pocket sized, but it is only about 8"" square. It uses small plastic balls about 1/2"" in diameter; not the real marbles that the original version had. It is still a good game and plays the same as it did years ago, but if I had known that it wasn't like the original, I wouldn't have paid the price for it."
4,stay alive,I remember playing this game as a child and enjoyed the fun. This new version of the game seems durable. I was dissappointed though as it is quite a bit smaller than the original version and has plastic marbles. There are not so many holes and not as many combinations. Still if you are looking for a game the is close to the original this is what they came up with. The kids do enjoy watching the marbles fall.
4,Memories of fun,"My brother and I used to play this game for hours on end ""back in the day"". I was so excited when I found it on Amazon. Unfortunately my brother is no longer with us, but I am looking forward to showing my children how much fun you can have without a computer, ipod, cell phone,etc. This game brings back some great memories!The only drawback was that the game only came with about 7 marbles. It's susspose to have 20. But hey it is over 20 years old! I plan on purchasing some marbles at the local dollar store."
2,Too expensive for size of game,"I had this game as a child and my children have enjoyed playing it at my parents' house. My mother thought my kids would like to receive it for Christmas, so I ordered it for her. Based on the price, I thought it would be the full-sized version that my parents own. It definitely wasn't!! And I'm sure my kids will be disappointed that it's not the same size they're used to playing. It should be stated directly under the name of the game that it is, basically, a travel-sized version. There's no way a game this size should be this price!"
5,Comprehensive Curriculum of Basic Skills - Grade 6,"I really love this series. There are two types of books with exactly the same name. One series typically has an animal on the cover. The series that shows the blackboard with topics is the ideal series for providing supplemental materials or a host of content areas.This series has several content areas that the animal series does not. I like the science and critical thinking components of this particular series. I use these books to supplement curriculum for just about every content area, mathematics, science, social studies, langauge arts, and spelling, etc.I also use the book when preparing thematic units and independent seatwork activities. I have the full series for grades first through sixth. I wish it also came in the secondary grade levels."
4,Amazing,"I love Native Americans, I'm studying their history in University and this is very interesting. I have to rea this book for this class and frankly, I'm glad of it because it is very well written and amazing!"
4,We love George,A great DVD with three really good episodes of George Shrinks and a bonus episode of Seven Little Monsters. I wish this show was still being made. We own all of the DVD's that are available.
3,Not the best,"Great price for the erasers, however the kids complained because the tops would break off. Not real sturdy which means they don't last as long as they should.."
3,Erasers not tight on pencil,I got this box of pencil erasers since I am sick of having my 9 year old daughter go through the pencil top erasers like mad. The only complaint I have about these erasers is the fact that they don't fit tight on the pencil. Other than that they work fine.
5,Wolfgang's Vault Has the Whole Show,"I finally found a vinyl version of this on eBay, only to learn that it's on Nils' web site and available for purchase here. One other thing I found out is that Wolfgang's Vault (or Concert Vault as it's known) has the entire show, including Rock and Roll Crook, for sale and as a free (with registration) stream. It's $9.98, and non-DRM to boot!This show sounds just as good as it did 33 years ago, and even though digital versions exist, it was immensely satisfying to score the LP - I've been searching forever...."
5,Two different versions of this translation,"Reviewing this book is difficult because there aretwo distinguishable versions. The hardcover version from International Book Center in Troy, MI, could be the version that uses the word God to translate the Arabic word Allah (as Ali intended) and retainsAli's balanced treatment of various Islamic sects. The other version of this book contains the phrase""revised and edited"" on the cover, and, more than a review, this is a suggestion that if these words appear on the cover or title page, book buyers ought to be toldbecause it may alter their interest in the book. Ali's book is not one of the best, it is the best English translation of the Quran"
2,Disappointing experience,This is definitely not the book which can help a Western student of Vedic Astrology to develop deeper understanding of an art and refinement of 'brilliant predictions'.Whithout any further subtle psychological explanations and/or interpretations of the Dashas and Sub-Dashas it can be oversimplifying.
5,One of a Kind,Frampton has a dazzling artistry which comes across in the unique mood he creates for each song...truly one of a kind.This is the next best thing to seeing this wizard perform in person!
3,"This book will get you off your big, fat couch.","This book will get you off your big, fat couch and over to the computer to WRITE! It convinces that anyone can write. It's like quilting--even if the stitches are not blue-ribbon, it is still a good and useful quilt when it's done!"
1,Save your money.,"This is a lightweight book without much substance. If you want a similar - and much better - book on the same topic, try Julia Cameron's ""The Artist's Way."""
2,Not good,The movie was upposed to be funny. I couldn't even follow it. I ended up shutting it off halfway through.
5,It KILLED me,"Russel Brand is just as funny as can be. Super cast and just very well done. Be warned, some of the humor is not for the feint of heart. Also, for those of you who didn't know, the character of Aldous Snow was featured in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and they allude to it in this movie. You will appreciate it that much more if you've seen that movie too."
3,Extras not included,"The movie worked okay. It was a little scratched, but that was easily fixed. The main problem was the fact that what I received was actually a rental movie from what I think was Blockbuster. I was only able to watch the movie itself, the extras were not included on this dvd. I wasn't bothered too much by this, but I hope the person who I bought this for doesn't mind either. I would have appreciated knowing this was a rental before I bought it. Other than that, and considering the price, I was happy with it."
3,An Ok Movie,"A friend recommended that I watch this movie since Russell Brand reprised his role from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a movie which I liked. Brand was funny again in this movie, but overall I found the movie somewhat boring and disappointing. My favorite part of the entire film was when they were making fun of Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies. Of course that scene was about 15 seconds. I paid $8 or $9 for the DVD so at least it was cheap. If you still want to see it, I would rent it from one of those $1 per day rental machines rather than buying it. I would rate it at 2 1/2 stars."
5,Do yourself a favor...,".. and get this movie. It's crude and laugh out loud funny. In this day and age of remakes/redo's of movies and ideas already been made, this movie stands out and holds its own."
4,Lol,This movie was hilarious! The streaming was a little spotty towards the end. But not terribly bad. Overall I would definitely recommend this movie
3,just ok,there are so many other movies I would watch first. The idea of the movie was good it just had too many parts that caused me to fain interest.
3,trying to get a laugh out of thin air,this movie obviously has some great laughs - but it has a lot of racy stuff also which just doesn't seem to fit also - it's like the movie could have been better without it.IT was like they were trying to take a story that wasn't that exciting and trying to make it funny when it really wasn't that funny to begin with - well that didn't make it funnier.But there's certainly some very funny moments in the movie. It's still an enjoyable movie even with all the junk in it. And when I mean junk I mean stuff that doesn't fit or make a lot of sense. But there's still some great music in this - most of which could be a hit if it were really done by a real person. They should release these as singles - really.But the characters go out of character enough to where they aren't as believable as they could or should be. But it's still a pretty funny movie.Not suggested for family audiences though - not really appropriate for kids - adult humor.
5,Great addition to any movie collection,"Get Him to the Greek will have you laughing from start to finish, and is a film all can enjoy!"
4,good movie but not as good as forgetting sarah marshall,to me the movie was really good had some very funny moments wouldnt say it its as good as forgetting sarah marshall but its worth the watch
2,Bum,"I was hoping this movie would be funny, hilarious and all, but it was a disappointment to me. I dont like it"
2,Get him to Greek,"Didn't think the movie was that funny, I was expecting something better. It dragged out and the story line was not that great."
2,only brief moments of enjoyment...,"This movie had a few parts where I laughed. The rest was ludicrous and awkward and made me wonder why I was still watching. I suppose I was hoping the movie would redeem itself somehow, but it never did."
1,An obnoxious movie,"A low level talent scout at a record company is tasked with bringing a declining rock star to L.A. for a concert in order to revive the fortunes of the record company. Upon his departure, the scout has a disagreement with his live-in girlfriend about their future plans, but the relationship between these two remains underdeveloped throughout. Instead we are treated to a loud and crude film that has as its fatal flaw, the fact that it is not very funny. A bitter disappointment."
1,"Slow, boring and not funny.","Such a let down. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was funny, Get him to the Greek was cheesy and lame. If you have to see it, rent it or borrow it from one of your poor friends who wasted their hard earned money on the dvd."
2,Funnier the first time around.,"1st time I saw it I thought it was one of the funniest movies. I bought it and was looking forward to watching it again. Unfortunately, it was not as funny as I thought it would be. Not the kind of movie you'd spend money on to own."
1,Do not watch,"I'm up for a good comedy just like anyone else, and I like adult humar. This movie was all adult, but there was no reason for it. It's almost like they tried to be disgusting for absolutely no reason. It wasn't even funny. The preview is vary misleading. One star was being nice."
2,Get Me To Another Movie,"I can honestly say that this was a movie I did not enjoy watching. I sat through the whole thing only because I wanted to give it a chance to become more entertaining for me. Sadly, it never happened. There were some very brief moments in the film that were mildly entertaining for me. Not enough to make me want to give this movie more than a 2-star rating. I usually like Jonah Hill's comedic range. This movie was just a little too out there for me. I'm not trying to bash the movie in any way. I am merely saying that it did not live up to my expectations. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching it. It probably had more to do with the actions that took place in the movie that I didn't particularly enjoy seeing. This is the first review I've ever written here on this site where I really do not feel like recommending this movie at all to anyone. It's the kind of movie that people will see if they want to see it."
2,Can't decide whether or not to be a chick flick,"Yet another in an increasingly long line of comedies that starts off as a rude, crude guy comedy, then tries to morph into a chick flick in the last 30 minutes. The problem is that that would require that you actually CARE about the one-dimensional characters. So it winds up too watered down to appeal to the average guy, and too gross and unromantic to appeal to the average girl. Who cares if he gets the girl at the end? The relationship is portrayed as pretty messed up, so why would anyone even want it to be saved? I also found it curious that the rock songs morph into generic, autotuned pop drivel in the last 30 minutes as well. LAME."
2,Darker than I expected.,"If you're looking for lighthearted entertainment, keep looking.The Jonah Hill character goes through some strange stuff.And the over-the-top things which the Jonah Hill character says detracts from his likeability (to his girlfriend: Big deal that you're a doctor. That doesn't mean you're a good person. There were Nazi doctors.)"
5,great,Great product was gave it as a gift. I say this movie and thought it was too funny so i decided to make it part of a gift basket & my brother loved it.
1,Really? Are you kidding?,"I love a good Russell Brand movie, but this one was awful. I don't find drugs to be funny, nad honestly I couldn't even get through it. It was so UNFUNNY i wish I could get the time back I put into it."
2,Get him to the geek (bonus points for making fun of Lars Ulrich),"This should have been a funny film, instead it was a f ilm about people you don't really care about. If it had been an over-the-top rock `n' roll fantasy it would have been fine, but instead we get all sorts of mush, like Aldous Snow's reconciliation with his dad, with his ex-wife, and Aaron Green getting the courage to stand up to his boss and to break up with his emotionally manipulative and boring girlfriend. Wooo... aaaaahhh... Some funny bits, like the pretentious ""African Child"" stuff, and Sean Combs was surprisingly good as a corrupt record executive (then again, maybe he was just playing himself). But I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, really (the MMF threesome scene, for example, is particularly unpleasant). Oh, wait, maybe I would - the cameo with Lars Ulrich is pretty funny, especially because the filmmakers are particularly unflattering towards him, making Lars look like the dork that he is."
5,Get Him to the Greek,"I ordered this before Christmas and it came just before New Year's day. I ordered this at the same time as two other movies and they came in time for Christmas. I gave this as gift for Christmas so I have not watched this movie, but my son raved over it so I gave it a rating of 5 stars."
1,Brand and this movie both stink,"This wanna be comedy never gets on track, isn't that funny and Russell Brand is a lousy actor. Don't waste your time with this movie. Boring, predictable, not to funny."
1,Movies review,"Love the actors, just not that funny. (this is minimum words required for this product that I care to share with you)!"
1,get him to the greek dvd - very bad seller,"This seller is not trustworthy and I had an overall bad experience. I was sent a defective DVD, it turns on but has so many errors that eventually it turns off within the first 5 minutes of the movie. I tried to contact the seller twice and i received no response. It also took them way past the time they said it would take to ship it. I would not recommend doing business with this seller."
4,Better than I expected.,This movie surpassed by expectations. It looked funny from the previews I'd seen and it was WAY better than I expected. Watching it never gets old. The only moderately negative thing I could say about it is do NOT watch this one with your parents or parents do not watch with your children. I'm 23 and would be exceedingly uncomfortable if my parents watched this with me.
5,Loved It,"This made me feel like I was a teenager again. I grew up watching Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, so this was a perfect fit for me!!"
3,Some Funny (and Disgusting) Parts,"This movie made me laugh out loud several times, but overall pretty shallow and formulaic. Get and and enjoy it for what it is... (Some of the anal sequences were discomforting)."
4,Hilarious,"Edan Aharony - A hilarious movie a notch below The Hangover or I should say 2 notches below which says highly about this movie. Jonah Hill is great in portraying himself, it seems. The guy is continually torn between his need to fulfill the life he always dreamed of (Rock and Roll, Chicks and Drugs) and the life he know is the right life to live - a stable life with a good paying job and a wife that loves him. Russel Brand as the rocker, a roll he carried over from Forgetting Sarah Marshall (she makes a cameo in this movie)is excellent. He is the one who is drawing Jonah Hill to the forbidden life and he does it with great talent. And P Diddy is the master mind of it all the guy who mind [...] everyone. Great movie, lots of laughs. Edan Aharony"
3,Not horrible not great,"This movie is entertaining but falls way short of funniest movie of the year. Its drags at parts and other parts is hilarious. Bonus, is that this actualyl comes with a digital copy to put on toy our ipod or ipad or both. If you dont like Russel Brand or Jonah Hill, this movie will drive you INSANE!"
3,Funny :),"I enjoyed this movie - it was good. At time really funny, and at times a bit slow. But overall, pretty good."
5,nonstop laughs,Not for children under 16!! Bit for adults that love crude humor this is a must have!!! A non-stop thrill rode of laughs
4,Funny Movie,"One of Russell Brand's better movies, my husband I laughed so hard. The comedy is kind of raunchy but it definitely better than Arthur."
5,love This MOVIE!!,IT HAS all the songs in karaoke as well as regular viewing video too!! LOTS OF FUN TO EXPLORE & LISTEN/SING ALONG!!
5,Great Movie,Russell Brant and Jonah Hill are genius. A very funny. Aldous Snow is a brilliant character and I hope they incorporate him into another movie.
2,Not as good as it looked,"This movie looked like it was going to be a pretty funny continuation to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, not true. I only found some parts of this movie funny, and nothing that I really laughed at. If you want a funny movie with these two actors in it, get Forgetting Sarah Marshall because that had me laughing all the way through. Disappointed in this movie, the only thing that made it decent was Diddy, which is sad."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this movie and actually stopped watching halfway through. I normally like both of the main actors and really enjoy this type of humor, but this movie was simply not funny enough to warrant 2 hours of my time."
1,The First 2 Minutes,"The first two minutes were like watching a combination of Tarzan and Lincoln in a Twilight Zone skit on the now boring SNL. Over-played sterotypical entertainment values of British and American elites seems to further erode genuine comedic quality in films produced by western cultural media ""Mannequin Heads"" operating out of hollywood today. They have lost the ability to make a ""Mo-Fo"" laugh without having a barf bag handy and a therapist on call. Even if you view this at 4:20 PM it still doesn't help. I got more laughs out of a episode of ""Family Guy"" than this movie, and thats a cartoon. If this is your type of humor I'm sure you will get some sh!ts and giggles out of ""Idiocracy'. Dontcha just love to see the vanity whores of La-La Land waste and make money."
1,It sucked. Save yourself 3.99,It sucked. I wasted two hours of my life. I lost $3.99. I am filled with regret.
1,Movie DVD,The DVD is not formated correctly so it will not play on my Blue Ray player. It will probably be a pain to return.
3,fun but not real informative!,jorge seems to have more fun making part two.but part one is more informative by far.still fun to watch.there are repeats from the first dvd.so If you are a beginner looking to learn buy the first one.
3,"Well-written reference, but nothing new","I bought this book because I really enjoyed Fox's Big Bang book. I was pretty disappointed. Though written well, this book is an overly sanitized biography that really doesn't add anything to the literature on Einstein. If you're in middle school or high school and doing a first report on Einstein, this book will probably be very helpful. If you're looking for insight or a new take on Einstein, as I was, this book is not for you."
5,DaVinci Redux,"The author has taken real facts and real settings and woven them into a fascinating story. Dr. Goodson takes several items with which he is very familiar (a dysfunctional family relationship, the Catholic Church, the Thomas Merton story, and local and national politics) and fashioned an intriguing tale which is fast-moving and extremely believable. Living in Nashville and having visited Gethsemani, I found this a true page turner. For his first novel, the author has set a high mark. This book is an easy read and will not disappoint."
1,Nope! Didn't like the phone case.,This product has already broke into pieces and is no longer protecting my phone the way it should be.
1,How can these poems be compared to Robert Frost or Emily Dickenson's poems?,What a waste of trees. Poems are written very similar in style with each other. Poems are very generic that anyone can write. I can't believe people would buy this book.
5,relaxing and exciting,"I enjoy reading this book. Haven't finished it yet but the poems are of such different styles and emotions. Usually poems bore me, but after having read some of his poetry online before his book was published, I realized how easily I can understand his poems as opposed to others. I have a feeling that 20 years down the line, as I flip through the pages of this book once again, the emotions that I'll feel will be different from those of today. It's just one of those books that when you read between the lines at different stages in your life you get a different perspective. great and quite enjoyable!!!(side note: xtiffywiffyx can't spell ""knack"")"
3,Helicopter Safety & Survival,"This DVD is ONLY for passengers and this should be made clear in the review. As I pilot I felt that I wasted $59. The cover is printed on an inkjet printer and the DVD is a copy, not a mass produced item. Fine for lounges of Heli operators that ferry pax. Of no use to pilots."
2,Where's the recommendations?,"There appears to be a trend in B&B review guides where no actual recommendations are provided -- they just compile information about the B&Bs (making one wonder how much first-hand research was involved.) This book has no recommendations for B&Bs, other than a list at the beginning that categorizes each B&B under something like ""Most Romantic B&Bs"" or ""Best Seaside B&B"".While having all the data in one place is useful, you can find most of this information on-line, or from various B&B brochures. What I wanted to know was which B&B's the author recommended, and what were the best features (and significant problems) with each B&B.The only book I've seen that seemed to have some actual recommendations (and research) done in it was the Fodor's book on Pacific NW B&Bs."
5,Definite High Quality,"I got 2 of each of the three sizes, six duffle bags in all. It's not like I collect duffles as I had none. I'm happy with these purchases and especially in comparison to duffles selling usually for a little more and of lesser quality in stores.The material is thick and sturdy, smelling like canvas. Zippers are large and made to last, with double stitching around them. There are handles on the side in the middle and on one end. There are metal rings to fasten a shoulder strap, but no strap was included.The largest bag is very large. It's about the size of the duffles I had in the Army many years ago - quite large. Depending on what you fill it up with, it could be a bear of a heavy thing to tote. Even the middle sized bag is larger than anticipated. The smaller bag might be appropriate for more uses. I recommend getting all sizes."
5,Perfect for my needs,I ordered this bag to hold camera lighting equipment. It's absolutely perfect. The bag is very sturdy and well made.
3,Not 3478!!,"Be careful when you order this, the item # 3478 by Rothco is in fact a 21 x 36 duffle. Acemart will ship you a 30 x 50 body bag with the product number of 3478. 3490 is a 30 x50 bag. I wanted the 3478 21 x 36. The price is great and the bag is great quality, but enormous!! I will keep it and store something in it..But have gone with another company and ordered the smaller size I actually wanted. Acemart's shipping label said the 30 x 50 was item number 3478. It's not..."
5,Big Tuff Bag,"Big Bag. Tough zipper. Rugged Canvas. would be sweet if it had a spot for a shoulder strap, but it is still a great bag."
3,Love to order but sizes dont make sense,I would love to order one of these but the description has size names that differ from pull down menu. Guess I will look elsewhere.
4,Wrong Size Information,"Please note: In the description the standard size is listed as 31""x36"", but in reality it's 21""x36"". I noticed this while doing research on this bag. This mattered to me because I'm looking for a very specific bag size, so I thought this information could be relevant for others."
4,Great Affordable Duffle Bag,"This review is for the Olive Drab 42x25"" Bag, sold by Amazon.comI purchased this Duffle bag to hold 2 5x10ft soccer goals:Franklin Premier Folding Goal (5-Ft. x 10-Ft.)I uploaded 2 pictures of the Bag in use.Only thing it is missing is a shoulder strap.It has the ring holes for a strap, but did not include one.If it did, I would rate it 5 Stars.I just received this bag, in July 2010.Once I have had it for a few months I will update the review with durability."
2,Poor quality,Poor quality. Not strong duffel and only 1 carry handle. In my first use from New York to Sao Paulo (Direct Flight and flagged as fragile) with 70 lbs of clothes and some small cases the bag arrived torn. But this is all you can expect for this price.
2,Poorly Executed,"I just received the book and was fairly disappointed by the overall quality. Except for the cover jacket and the first three double-page photos, the majority of the image reproductions are of poor quality. First, many of the photos look like they were scanned from prints rather than digitally reproduced directly from the original data and show defects like scratches. The photos suffer from a poor selection of dithering pattern used to reproduce the many colors. This gives the overall impression of a grainy photo. Quite a few of the images are displayed at too large a size and have excessive pixellation. A few pages of text were marred with stains or bleed through from the printing process. Finally, about half of the images at the end of the book dealing with the planets are not from Hubble at all. Having seen most of the images in this book in either their native FITS or tif formats I do know what the quality of these should be - and this book ain't it!"
4,A joy to read... even the painful parts.,"I'm sorry I waited so long to read this book! Not a Daddy Dearest novel as I had expected, and not a book that got published just 'cause the author has a famous father. Jonathan Bach is a solid author in his own right... has the potential for surpassing his dad's ability to WOW me. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I was inspired. I look forward to reading more from Jon."
3,Great book for Bach fans,"This was a tough book for a young man to write. Besides following in famous feet, he had to determine and then expose his feelings for his father...difficult for most at any age.If you are a fan of Richard Bach, you have to get your eyes on this book! It is a factual account of another side to a terrifically talented writer.It is also a good introduction to a writer (Jonathan) who will show himself again in the future to be insightful and inspirational.If you can find 'Above the Clouds', get it while you can and place it on the shelf with all the other Bach books where it should be."
3,Needs major updating,"Although I agree that this book provides a good overview of pregnancy, there are some glaring omissions, considering this book has not been updated for nearly a decade. Since then, new infertility advancements such as Clomid (not mentioned) have become mainstream. In addition, the book gives no warning as to the potential dangers of eating certain types of fish that contain high levels of mercury. Better to wait until the next edition comes out--whenever that may be!"
5,Mayo Clinic Complete Book of Pregnancy & Baby's First Year,"This is the greatest book there is. I get one for all of my ""expecting"" friends/family."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book answers every question you can think of during your pregnancy. It covers all physical expectations and surprises, as well as what to expect emotionally from the day you find out you're pregnant, to the day after delivery. It even tells you what kind of pain to expect during labor and delivery. It describes in laymen's terms what is going on inside your body and all the medical jargon and testing.Mayo Clinic is a world-renowned hospital with wonderful doctors who collaborated on this book. And the best thing is, it's far from being preachy and paranoid. The Mayo Clinic Guide to Pregnancy is based on the truth that women have been successfully getting pregnant and having babies for THOUSANDS OF YEARS and all those strict rules and myths about what you can and can't do are not necessarily true. My interpretation is that this book encourages a healthy lifestyle without alchohol, drugs or smoking... other than that, the average pregnant woman has very few limitations."
5,Exceptionally informative book about pregnancy & child birth,"I strongly recommend this book for any one who is expecting a baby. This is a ""must have"" book to add to your family library. My son is 15 months now, and we still can refer to this book as a ""preliminary diagnosis"" for any symptoms that he may have before calling the doctor."
5,This is a great guide!,"I have not had any children - but this as soon as I hear of a friend who is pregnant - this is the gift I give them. I have read the whole thing - and it has been a help to me in relating and interacting with any new babies in my life. The fathers really seem to like it also - I think it answers a lot of questions they may be too embarrassed to ask the mother or her doctor. My sister-in-law helped to research, write and edit this book, and she has herself been pregnant twice, so she has a great perspective on the information in it. It's the only book I give to my pregnant friends."
4,A good compliment to your library of pregnancy books,I liked this book in conjuction with a few others. It had some information that others didn't have.
3,Not bad..,"This is a big heavy book, full of lots of information. But as other posters have mentioned, it is a bit outdated. It calls Norplant and Depo ""New"", when it has been around for awhile now. The pictures are a little outdated. I liked Miriam Stoppards ""Conception, Pregnancy and Birth"" for its pictures and brief look at topics. I will use this one a reference, but some of the sections need a complete overhaul."
3,"Never mind the textbooks, get a friend's guide","This book is generally well-written and fairly comprehensive. It reads however like a textbook for parents. Get 'A best friend's guide to pregnancy' for a better, more humorous look at the realities of the big-belly days. Some basic elements were not well covered: such as 'false labor'. The guide to developmental stages of the newborn is useful. I would recommend this book but not as your only tome on this fantastic experience."
5,Delving into the Sources,"Ward has produced a clear, highly readable translation that makes the thoughts and sayings of the Fathers and Mothers of the Desert (first few centuries of our era) available to a readership with no background in classical languages. Her work enables us to draw on the simplicity and depth of early Christians, providing a refreshing perspective on spirituality and religion."
4,Decent translation of the alphabetical AP,"Professor Ward's translation is the standard (and, to my knowledge, only) English translation of the alphabetical collection of the Apophthegmata Patrum. While she does a good job of connecting the manuscript and transcription work of Jean-Baptiste Cotelier and Jean-Claude Guy, her translation occasionally leaves something to be desired. I am not convinced of her renderings and phrasings, but overall this is a good translation. The introduction gives some good (albeit somewhat outdated and biased) information regarding early Christian asceticism and monasticism. If you're looking for a good, basic translation of the collected sayings of early monasticism, you'll find a good start here."
1,how did this guy ever get a job?,"oooh that's right, he must have done to the bosses what he does to readers...that is he must have used his world-class poseur powers. the worst writer in any medium of all time."
4,A great read,"I really loved the story and the characters. In the beginning, it was kind of hard to distinguish the characters, because the reader is thrown right into the action. Still, what most impressed me was the dialogue and the issues handled in the story that are very relevant: rebellion, insecurity, independence."
5,Neat read!,"This book has a neat hook, with neat characters, and a crazy twist at the end. With all that's happened so far, where can they go from here? Guess we have to wait until they create Vol. 2! Recommended for Whedon fans as well. Many pop culture references and epigrams ensue!"
4,Great for Spider-man fans and teenagers..,"This book has the scariest twist of all the mainstream comics I have seen lately, and it will hit you like a hammer. Of course, it is difficult to maintain that kind of suspense til the end of this hardcover book (which is all 18 issues of first volume of Runaways), but it will appeal to teenagers who like suspense/horror/esotheric stuff."
2,"Great art and story, but poor binding","While I loved the story and art, my copy came damaged. Pages fell out and it is difficult to tell whether this is due to poor packaging or the binding of the book itself. Needless to say I'm an unhappy camper."
5,A great read...,"I picked up runaways when it first started and dropped it at issue 4 not because it wasnt good because it was it was great. its just i started going to college. And i got to admit that was a mistake this is a fantastic book and extremely under rated... i mean by readers not critics the critics seem to drowl all over this book. The problem is this book doesnt have the letter x or the word bat, super or spider in it. Anyways on to the book its self this is great story the kids have just gotten away from theyre ""super villian"" parents and have picked up a new runaway by the name of topher. The dialogue is clever and witty the art is beautiful.. even though im not a huge fan of the art in the cloak and dagger story. Alex always seems a little off. I highly recommend this book"
3,Check carefully before ordering...,Warning: Read up on this distributor or check with a qualified mechanic before purchasing. I ordered it as a replacement for a 1988 GM 5.7 with computer controlled HEI. This unit is for a NON-COMPUTERIZED GM V-8 1957-2006. The only place that will tell you that it is for a non-computerized vehicle is O'Reilly Auto Parts. Probably a good unit but I'll have to send it back for a refund.
2,This book gave me nightmares,"While the author is well meaning in her love of all living things, the story of Kierney left me devestated and unhappy. By the end of the book I cried, not from the beautiful story, but at the life this dog lead. I had high hopes when I began reading but they were dashed at how this dog suffered needlessly. I guess her well intentioned ""help"" just prolonged the dogs sickly and unhappy body.. Sometimes it is best to have Quality of life not just a selfish Quantity that we humans think our pets should have.Dee Moravec"
1,Selling this toy is child abuse,"This (tiny) toy is junk. First, know that it comes in a box and has to be assembled....which is where the trouble begins. The parts are supposed to force fit, but they are poorly matched, easily fall apart, and virtually impossible to glue together (as a back up expedient, doesn't work). In addition, the instructions are so poorly drawn that trying to match each of the four tentacles to the correct (and poorly fitted) slot is maddening. This toy makes the cheap stuff on your average drug store toy rack look like a high quality bargain. Save your money, your temper, and your child's disappointment. Skip this evil Doc Ock."
1,Do not buy...poor quality,I purchased a horseman's pride mounting block and it lasted 6 months. Horse stepped on it and put a hoof through. It was OK during warmer months but when it got cold the polymer got extremely brittle and broke. All steps now have dangerous gashes/cracks in them from just human weight. Just a caution. Product would be fine to use around a very calm horse and outside a round pen or arena. Personally if I were to repurchase one then I would carry it out when I needed it and then put it in a warm place. The outdoors are not friendly to the polymer.
2,spin spin spin,seems I may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while I was doing exercise and heard a POP now it spins all the time I use it - Not happy :( I did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already.
1,"Very, very unpleasant book.","Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante is a book I stumbled upon in a used book shop and purchased on a whim. It was difficult for me to read, in that the subject matter was more about what I perceive to be immoral activity than psychic abilities.Certainly, I would not want this author as a ""confidante."" And I certainly do not value her as an author."
5,"Enjoyable Reading! Fun, Fun, Fun to read","I just finished this book. I had to write since I would definitely love to read Regina Milbourne's autobiography. This book is loosely based on her life, and is fiction mostly, leaving it very entertaining. I completely enjoyed it. I know some people don't believe in psychics but the book is a good read and will give you the good, bad and ugly of the world. It is a nice break from reality. Looking forward to the autobiography."
2,"Great WRITING book, but not for reading!!","I'm shocked at all of the positive reviews on this, relating to reading/phonics. The Explode the Code books (I ordered up through 8)seem to be predominantly writing (with a little bit of reading). My son (age 5) is a fluent reader (can read books written for adults) and can write simple sentences, but this book overwhelms him physically. The books include writing sentences, unscrambling words to create sentences, and writing simple words (over and over and over). I think it's a great book for practicing writing (in small spaces), but the reading practice is hardly there. THE PROBLEM: the reading level and writing level seem to be very different - the writing level is advanced, while the reading level is not advanced."
5,"Stacy Q, Too Hot For Love","The is an excellent CD for fans to buy,the quality of sound is great also."
4,A favorite of the securities industry,Schwartz provides the academic ammunition in support of the securities industry's resistance to move into penny-tick size pricing. No wonder NASDQ loves him.
5,A smart man explains the equity markets,"This book is not really about reshaping the equity markets, or at least those parts of it are outdated by now (it was written in 1993). However, it gives a very thorough and easy-to-read explanation of the arcana of market structure, order processing, and the like. Extremely useful for ambitious beginners."
2,Work Well But There's a Problem,"Once you get these clip-ons in place, they work just fine.....They are big enough to cover almost any size glasses, but not so big that they rub against the cheekbone. One big problem though: The two halves of the clips are relatively stiff and almost exactly the same length. That may not seem important, but it makes it maddeningly difficult to install the these clip-ons on your glasses....so I wouldn't recommend them. I wish some product designers would think things through more carefully."
4,"Readable, quick reference, good for overall understanding","Dr. Zophy has gone through a lot of trouble to make this book a readable guide for first-time students of Renaissance history. It follows a clear outline and is followed by a short list of dates at the end of each chapter. Visual aids also abound in the book with several paintings and examples of art from different periods. However, there are some problems in the actual references. Also, there is a problem with the priority of some topics, which favor women who made little difference while leaving out more important religious figures in history."
5,Magnificent Work,"This book is well written by the instructor. It explains all the aspects of the German Anglo and Italian Mediterranean Cycles. This book contains many illustrations- Kings,Queens,Albrecht Durer, Luther, Pope Sixtus, and also Women Renaissance Reformation figures of the time. This work is clear and direct, a must for any historian or enthusiast reader"
2,Samsung S390G - TracFone,"Although the phone does have a lot of features and Tracfone does give triple minutes, the one big drawback of this phone is the navigation pad. Most phones have a toggle ring around the center ""OK"" button that you use to navigate through the menus. This product has a pickup that you rub your finger across and causes you to slow down to select correctly. You have to , at times, re-select to get correct."
3,inexpensive but subjectivist,"This magazine is interesting because of the design aspects. I enjoy seeing what the high-end is doing as far as construction, cases, etc. I am more of a DIY or mid-fi type than high-end. This magazine is as fun as Stereo Review used to be, but take the reviews with a grain of salt."
4,The Best of the Best Reviews of Stereo Equipment,"This is a review of the purchase of a renewal subscription to Stereophile Magazine from Amazon. I have long been a subscriber to this publication, and so far, renewing through Amazon.com has been easy and economical. But it has not been long enough to know if I will get the proper extension on my subscription."
1,Cute but TINY,This 'womens medium' is too small for my 10 year old daughter who wears a girls size 10. I wasdisappointed because it looked like such a great buy.
3,Covers SHELL programming,"A more appropriate title for this book would be ""BASH Programming for Dummies"". I was expecting a book that covers basic C or C++ programming on the Linux platform, but instead I got a book on writing shell scripts. Oh well, that's what I get for impulse buying."
2,STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND LINUX,I was disappointed in this book. It just did not help me learn Linux. Too much of a reference manual and not enough explaining why or tutorials to learn how to set up and use this system.
1,Difficult to describe since it's so bad,"Title says it all. It's seriously so bad you're going to need to listen to it yourself to figure out why it's so bad. It's not even metal. It's like 80's hair band covers, the musicians aren't even that good. Seriously the talent required to pull this off is minimal at best. Search youtube or anything to listen to how horrible this is, perhaps it's worth the money just to show your friends and laugh."
3,Good primer on postmodernism for the average reader,"I thought this was a good book on postmodernism, taken with a grain of salt. It was my impression that, although the author claims postmodernism has some good points, Veith's overall view was a bit fatalistic. Also, this is more of an 'de facto' analysis from his point of view, with not much in the sense of specific application. Written from a Protestant perspective, I still think it is a good book to begin with for anyone who wants to get an initial grip on the issue. Worth the money."
1,Typically shallow analysis and self-serving insight.,"Veith's understanding (and embrace of) the postmodern mind is best demonstrated by the fact that he recently wrote an article for World magazine in which he argued (seriously) that the commercialization of Christmas marks the triumph of Christian culture! I jest not. Upon first reading this piece I thought it was satire. Veith is straight right-wing, big business, triumphalist (read ""ugly"") Christianity. Since postmodernists love irony, it is appropriate that Veith has also written a tome on the spirituality of the cross. If it pays, it must be good!"
5,book,"Came in great condition, haven't read it yet, but it looks good. We ordered it for our highschool reading course."
4,A Clear Overall Picture,"It's a good introduction to postmodern time from a Christian point of view.It stimulates my thinking and creates an urge to read more books in one of the specific areas (the book covers four areas: postmodern thought, postmodern art, postmodern society and postmodern religion)."
4,Intense and chilling to the core!,"Ever since 70-year-old Larry Mann set eyes on 23-year-old Amanda, the new tenant at a boarding house in London, he was convinced that she would be his new best friend. He is lonely and convinced that Amanda is his soulmate. Shy and depressed, Amanda has no idea how to turn his desperate attempts at kindness -- buying gifts, making tea parties, becoming her confidant -- down, especially when Francis, her lover, begins to spend weekends with her. Larry's intentions are good -- or are they? Is there something sinister behind his persuasiveness with Amanda? This extremely shocking, chilling, haunting and original thriller will keep you turning the pages until its disturbing conclusion. I marvel at the unique narration; Larry's voice drips with contempt and obsession. Penelope Evans has written an incredible thriller that should be devoured within days. Read it!"
1,Last Girl very boring,"This book was one of the worst I've ever read. Very slow moving, very boring, building up to a climax which isn't worth the wait. I don't know how it managed to get published at all. It would be more interesting to read the back of a cereal box."
3,Something is missing.,"""Once on This Island"" takes place during The War of 1812, but there was a lack of historical information to prove this point. It could have easily been another war. The story itself - three children struggle to live their lives while their father is off fighting for the American cause - is a stable one, though deficient. This could be because the events flowed nicely, without much difficulty, or maybe it was because there was a lack of illnesses and death; realism wasn't truly there. I was hoping for a historical note, but Whelan failed to include one. I'll still read the other two books in the trilogy, but I will not put high expectations on them. I ""sorta"" recommend."
3,"Good, but still...","I know, everyone rated this 5 stars. And I know that this book is for kids ages 6-10. I'm 14. This book, Once on this Island, is very good, but I think it could have been better. Still, it is written for younger children, so... Anyway, if you're older than ten, you'll most likely find it boring.Mary is living on an island in the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. Her father goes off to fight when the British take over her island and shortly after her older brother leaves. Mary's older sister flirts with a British soldier while Mary runs the farm. An Indian friend leaves to fight for the British alongside his long-lost tribe, which adds to the confusion.The first in a trilogy, the other 2 books are Farewell to this Island and Return to the Island. I havent read them yet, but Im planning to at least read Return to the Island. As I titled this review, it's good, but still..."
4,This was a very good book!,"This is a story full of colorful characters and excitement. Mary, the protagonist, her older sister Angelique, her brother Jaques, and Papa are American patriots who live on the Island of Michilmackinac (Mish-il-mack-in-aw) in Lake Michigan during the War of 1812. Michilmackinac Island was captured by the British during the war. Papa feels that it is his duty to go and fight for the Americans in Detroit. Angelique suddenly takes a fancy for a British soldier. Jaques, longing to travel beyond the island, goes off with his Indian friend, Gavin. Mary is determined to stay on the island and protect the farm. One of the things I liked about the book is that Mary is a spirited, strong person who loves tromping around in the woods, unlike many girls of her time. I also enjoyed the author's descriptions as well as her use of metaphor."
5,Another Dana Stabenow winner!,Stabenow's Kate Shugak books never fail to entertain. The settings and adventures of the intepid investigator in Alaska keeps you up late reading. Don't start one of these stories if you have to get up early
3,message to Brown University alums,"Y'all remember Rahsan-Rahsan from Brown? He's in this film. If you want to support alums trying to make it in film, then peep this. On campus, Rahsan was high-achieving (sp?), well-respected, nice, and an alpha male. It's a bit hard to suspend one's disbelief and see him playing a brotha who might as well chant, ""Everyday I'm hustling! Everyday I'm hustling!"" To be honest, you will never say this film in the same breath as ""The Color Purple."" Still, see it to see ol' Rahsan-Rahsan on the screen!"
4,excellent addition to your library,I recently lost my beloved cat of 14 years. At the same time our neighbors lost two of their beloved dogs. We were all floundering in grief and what to do and say. This book helped me with my own grief and also allowed me to say and do things better with others.
3,Flightmaster ROG Plane,Well this plane looks good and has a great flying speed.The only bad thing is that is to weak and easy to break. I've done many repairs allready.
4,Nothing Sacred,"This extraordinary book--more autobiography than fiction--is an original blending of the sacred and profane. Rick Sandford's only novel, published posthumously, reminds us that original voices in literature are far and few between nowadays. Some may find it grotesque and sacreligious, others deeply devout, but no one who risks reading it will come away unaffected."
3,Andre Norton's Forerunner series...,"is an excellent read. With this book she continues the story begun in her other book titled: Forerunner. Engaging, and a very good read, Andre Norton keeps the pace up and the reader riveted until the last page. If you like Andre Norton's other works, I suggest purchasing this one too."
5,Lalaloopsy DVD The Search for Pillow,Such a cute video and the characters are so sweet. My daughter just loves this whole cartoon. It's nice to see a wholesome new video come out and the product line of dolls are creative and equally impressive.
5,Cute Movie,It's worth it. My girls loved it. we watched it 3 times before it expired. Worth renting but I wouldn't buy the DVD....
2,Not much,"303 ways to shoot anything basically. Such as how to shoot a birthday, how to shoot a girls birthday, how to shoot a birthday on saturday.. you get the idea.."
3,Sizes Run Small,"I ordered both the black and the brown belts in Size 38 which is my waist size. Sadly - these belts run small and you need to order at least 2inches larger than your waist size. As I live overseas , return and replacement is not an option and i was greatly dissapointed that the sizing charts did not tip me on how to order the correct size which should have been 40"
4,GREAT DVD...but...,"This is a great instructional DVD by Miss Remler, but contrary to the title, there is NO instruction in bebop guitar at all, so do not get this DVD if you are looking for bebop instruction. Miss Remler was a great guitarist and teacher who died of a heroin addiction, and you can see the heroin addiction in Miss Remler's eyes during parts of this DVD, so personally I found it a bit chilling to watch at times. Nevertheless, this is a great instructional DVD for anyone wanting to learn Wes Montgomery style jazz guitar."
4,Chiropractic First,An excellent book. My Chiropractor gave me this book for Christmas. I quite enjoyed it. It makes a lot of sense and I look forward to better health through my Chiropractic treatments. My only concern is a lack of foot notes and references which I think is not very well explained on page 141. A great book overall!
1,Balderdash!,"I have reviewed this book and find that, even today, 108 years after D. D. Palmer ""discovered"" chiropractic, that Rondberg and many of the other reviewers still cling to this yet to be proven ""subluxation"" and ""nerve flow"" theory. No one has yet, to scientifically prove that a ""subluxation"" in the chiropractic sense, actually exists. There has never been any credible published information concerning the relationship of the ""subluxations"" to organic disease (skin problems, problems walking, diabetes, heart disorders, liver disease, etc). To publish such a book in today's world is irresponsible and leads false hope to people who need true help. It is true that the human body does have the ability to heal itself, but certainly not by the use of spinal adjustments to correct ""subluxations."" The book reads like a comic book. An Avid Consumer Healthcare Advocate in the USA."
5,"Great book, read it and understand Chiropractic",This book is well written for both the chiropractor and patients. Chiropractic works! Find out why and read this boo
5,Awesome Minneapolis-based Street Punk,"This album, to me, is the epitome of good punk music. Kinda remind me of the Street Brats, with an american version of Sucker, the singer from Oxymoron, on vocals. Every track on this cd is awesome. Add in group-sung Choruses, a staple of this type of music, and you have yourself a classic album. Check this one out ASAP."
4,Essential tool in your corporate innovation kit,Innovate or evaporate seems to be the mantra of most management gurus. Asked how to facilitate innovation these gurus usually lack an answer. Mason and Rohner are different as they show in this excellent book. Combining a clear framework with interesting examples this is a must read.To further develop your view on the topic of facilitating innovation in your organization I would recommend 'Webs of Innovation' by Alexander Loudon and 'Radical Innovation' by Leifer et.al.
1,unsafe?,"Well the bottle is polycarbonate, contains BPA, and carries a number 7. Who knows if this will prove dangerous, but why risk it. I have thrown mine away."
2,Function forgot it's Purpose...,"As a storage container, this one is fine. As a pouring container, it lost 3 stars! Anywhere over half full and it's PLUESH! all over the place. I think they could have done better here. The size was perfect for me as I was storing sun tea with them. These were replacements for widemouth gal. glass jars that were too difficult to maneuver in my refrigerator. The handle on these was a plus, and the polycarb. made them lighter than glass. But now I use a 1 1/2 gal. polycarb. dispenser type (2.5""w x 14""d x 9""h)that I don't even have to remove from the refrigerator! Takes up less space that anything else you'd find. Got it at WallyWorld."
1,Unsafe,"This is the same collection bottle that comes with the Megahome water distiller.I really do love my distiller, but the polycarbonate water container that it comes with, has a recycling number 7 on it and it DOES NOT say BPA free, which makes this highly suspect. Why take the risk?I threw mine away, and bought a gallon size plastic pitcher from Walmart. It's made by Sterlite, and it fits perfectly under my distiller water spout. It only cost $2.57. So again I ask, WHY TAKE THE HEALTH RISK with this item?"
1,Toxic and gives funny taste to water,"I chose to purchase a separate glass container for my distiller, and tossed this one out. Rather safe than sorry. We have enough toxins to deal with!"
3,Excellent photos and J.Deere history,"Nice photos. A very light read, not much new information. Better books out there."
3,Useful Ideas,"The book is basically a manual on how to asess your own chess and begin to cover up weaknesses and promote strengths. Emphasising the need for unviversality of style (covering weaknesses) it advocates a method of analysing the individuals games to come up with ways of strengthening openings, psychology and analysis at the board."
5,Buen reflejo de la música de Micus,"Nuevamente el gran multiintrumetista alemán nos trae un compendio de instrumentos musicales, a los que les arranca una gran cantidad de hermosos sonidos, mágicos, ensoñadores.Es increible coo un musico puede tener siempre tan alto nivel de calidad"
5,Very Interesting,A friend of mine lent me this book because she has triplets and I liked so much that I decided to buy it because I have twins. It's very useful for all stages of their lives. I definitely recommend it.
4,Good Bathroom Read,"Pretty typical Mental Floss book. Nothing like extremly cocktail about the book, but it the book is still entertaining none the less."
2,This is not the Delay...,"The music is by Unn. I fell prey to this same mix up at cdnow and returned it. It is an ok cd though, but is sort of minimalistic electronica/ambientish. It feels like one big piece."
4,"Good Science, good Fantasy","The first 150 pages of the book should have been shortened. From the 151st page, the story is fascinating."
3,"Great cutting edge science + fiction, but what a dumb ending","I must say that for the first 95% of this book, i was very interested. Cramer did a good job of combining the facts of the world of science with a good plot, but then the end! If there was more of a flop possible, i couldn't think of one. I recommend reading it, but be sure and grin and bear the end...."
3,"Good science and politics, endless novel","Interesting and pleasantly educational. A little extra time spent on a plot outine (especially to come up with AN ENDING, which this book totally lacks -- it has a stopping instead) would turn an average book into a solid effort."
2,A book only a physics nerd could love.,"As a professional in the life sciences, the physics of the Superconducting Super Collider and wormholes were inadequately explained. I remained a somewhat mystified outsider unsympathetic to all the main players, and the concept of the Iris character was just plain silly. Moreover, on page 48 of the paperback edition, the author has a traveler passing directly from Alabama into Louisiana without having to transit Mississippi. Now THAT'S a wormhole!"
3,Hard Science - Soft Geography,"I love it when the ""Hard Science"" group snubs other forms of science fiction yet they can't even read a map... On page 48 this genius has someone drive directly from Alabama to Louisiana without touching Mississippi... LOL...."
2,One of the easiest books to put down I've ever read,I'm sorry about this John. But your book Einstein's Bridge is a real sleeper. I've only read the first half of it and I'm falling asleep. I love hard fiction. And I'm a big SSC fan. Hell I even like bugs. But the first half takes so long in setting up the characters to their momentous encounter and adds alot of useless details about their lives. It's more fitting for a romance novel. I hope it improves. if so I'll write back.
5,It is great.,"This book mixes hard science with an alternate universe. It is a mix that might have fallen flat in other hands, but it works well here. I was particularly interested to see how he handled the workings of the SSC (the superconducting supercollider, which was built in the alternate universe). Cramer's speculation of a hive mind that savages universes they contact was a scary one. The science was believable, and the characters behaved like other physicists I have known. This is the best science fiction I have read this year. I recommend it to anyone interested in speculation that is science-based, not ""science fantasy"". Also interesting is Cramer's description of what happened to the SSC in our universe. He is passionate and witty here too. He definitely had a lot of inside knowledge, which served him well in the book."
5,Einstein's Bridge is not for sf nerds.,"At least Cramer, in spite of his scientific background, doesn't fall into these traps. His characters are interesting, decent morally, and are justifiably motivated to do what they have to do. Cramer also manages not to bog the reader down in inordinately long ramblings filled with technical jargon, or at least he made me feel not to be ignorant of what he was talking about by graciously filling me in on the numerous acronyms. Which is unlike what several current wordmeisters of modern hard scifi are actually doing. My only complaint with this exciting, easily readable and enjoyable book, was that Cramer seems to have truncated the tale too early, and left a bit of unresolved issues (maybe a sequel intended in that). Still, EB is clearly a heart-stopping mixture of Lovecraftian mythos and Borg mania. (Made me almost feel as if I was reading another great novel by William Browning Spencer [Resume With Monsters].) This book is a steal. Grab it!"
4,Fun ideas and a good read,"Starts with a realistic picture of scientists at work and adds some fantastic ideas for a fun, fast story. The science aspects are interesting and relevant to the story. Shows the politics behind doing big science in both government and academia. Some of the non-scientist character development is a little tedious and shallow hence 4 stars instead of 5."
4,This book is not common-people-fiction but SCIENCE fiction!,"This book got something to do with the first word in Science Fiction. Today, most of what is marked as Science Fiction got nothing to do with science but more with fiction of very common people. But not this book. It is a long time ago, since I've read a Science Fiction book as good as this one. By and then I bought another one and stopped reading it, because of Kings or Swords or Magic appeared on the scene. So I started being very careful - one cannot trust the reviews on the backside of a book.Most of the productive Authors -- productive in point of view of number of books a year -- are not able anymore to create a consistent plot -- one can easily see, how the plot developed, during the book was written - not so in this book"
5,Breathtaking,"I haven't read many science fictions, but this one just blew me away. It was so entertaining and was very hard to stop once I started reading. If other science fictions were half as good as this one, I would have read all of them."
5,"REAL Science Fiction, how novel!","This man knows his stuff. I especially enjoyed the way the scientific process was followed. Having performed many experiments (though not as important or technically demanding as described in this book), I can attest to the accuracy of the book. I was impressed with the character developement and the ease of ""getting into"" the story. TWISTOR was almost just as good. I keep checking Amazon for a new book from Mr. Cramer."
3,Gritty not glossy,"I've always found this movie to be very believable. Yes the development of the characters is sparse, but I believe that's the idea. Jeff Bridges plays a private detective who finds himself thrust into a situation in which he dosen't have the answers. As he meets the primary players involved so do you. The dialouge is untidy and sometimes the conversations don't go anywhere - much like real life. Those who inhabit the seamier side of our society do no have B.A's. Events move at what seems to be a sluggish pace, but when events come to the climax they come at you with the pace of a rocket. One needs to watch this movie and let things happen as they will. This is not a Bruce Willis slam bang action fest.And I do agree with one of the reviewers. The climax makes the whole movie worth watching. In my opinion this movie is a modern version of the old 1940's film - noir classics. It's pacing and characters are very faithful. Watch it."
3,Makes no sense,"Slow, confusing crime drama has no dramatic payoff, but does have some nice touches. Director Hal Ashby creates an authentically seamy atmosphere, and Jeff Bridges plays a down-and-out ex-cop pretty well. Andy Garcia and Rosanna Arquette, however, are pretty much one-note, and their characters don't make any sense. Alexandra Paul, as a doomed call-girl attempting to ""get out"" of the drug scene is the best thing about the movie. If you like to look at lowlife lifestyles, this is for you."
5,Making the City Come Alive Through Time,"I loved this book. After visiting and falling in love with Amsterdam, I sought to learn more of its history. This book does a great job of putting you inside the city throughout its long and remarkable history. From the first settlements at the edge of the wetlands to its zenith as the world's foremost trading power to modern times, author Mak makes the history come alive by focusing on individuals as well as the average Amsterdamer. Blom's translation is impeccable (I often find that Dutch translates very well to English). Highly recommended to the discerning traveler or the merely curious."
3,Better than most municipal historal titles.,"The chronology was a little difficult to follow, but this kept my interest level higher than a typical municipal history. Might be better in Dutch. Recommended pre-trip reading."
4,Good but not Secure,I can't quibble with the other reviewers' good evaluation of the product. It is so good that mine was stolen a few weeks after I installed it. This time I'll buy a plain lockable cover.
2,CCD Cannot Compare to Laser Scanning,"The WWS 800 CCD scanner is much cheaper than the WWS 850 laser scanner - but I found that it was inferior in all ways. Unless there was perfect lighting and a perfect barcode, the 800 couldn't decode the scan. The 850 is much more expensive but can read barcodes in any light and with many flaws."
3,Romanian Cooking,"For someone used to American (and western) cooking, it is better than its Romanian counterpart, which I just bought upon a recent visit to Romania.Recipes are clear and easy to follow.Lya."
5,Burdock Root Extract,"This product has been an excellent source of relief from the pain of gout and maintaining my uric acid level. Before my last doctor visit my uric acid level had been increasing gradually each visit. After using Burdock Root, at my last visit, there was no increase. My doctor was surprised. I was delighted."
5,Best Piano Magazine Ever,"I have been a subscriber since Volume 1. It is one of the best magazines for the serious pianist or the beginer. Good articles that are relevant, excellent choise of pieces to perform, and the CD is a great help - especially with the music minus one. If you want to improve your scope of music - and add additional perfomance peices - this magazine is a must."
4,for many levels,"This magazine comes with a CD and printed music that goes from beginning Bach to Lizst. The articles have great depth, and there's a Q&A page with very specific suggestions. Although it's coming from Canada, I have not noticed much of a wait for each issue. I recommend it to classical players from (not quite) beginner to advanced. (They also occasionally have a contemporary piece, but I don't love those.)"
5,"Great product, a real timesaver!","Cheap insurance against damaging finished floors. Saves time because you can leave it down for 45 days, so instead of rolling out and picking up dropcloth runners every day, you put this down once and just vacuum or sweep it everyday! It can be put down with one person (easier with two). I recommend running a pushbroom over it once to get the air bubbles out from under it."
2,Hard Wood Protection,"Arrived on time, easy to apply. No problem removing it from an engineered wood floor. Kept the floor clean and undamaged during the move."
1,Great Deal but sized incorrectly,"If you typically wear a womens medium, dont buy. It is way too small, even for a 10 year old girl."
2,Only for procurement historians.,"I understand those who are skeptical to stamp collectors of loose aviation facts, but there has to be a middle ground. Except from some few tens of pages about the early history of the CAS role early in the page, on turned into a long, tedious recount about the Army's struggle with the Air Force, to get a well suited aircraft for the CAS role. There is almost nothing about the choices and thought processes behind the development of this (or these) aircrafts. Not with the development of the tactics. And not with any change in the psychology and attitude with regards to flying this ""ugly"", subsonic aircraft.Despite enticing chapter titles, it's just a procurement story. And most of all the political side of it."
3,For aviation experts,"I was a bit dispointed by this book, i'm a big aviation BUFF and read a lot of books and knew for the most part the devloppement of close air support and the A10. here you've got an intersetsing summary but not that much details on the A10 (ex : all the CAS techniques involved in USING this plane !)One last point for aviation experts is the uge list of references used in the process (more than 1/3 of the book!) i was really dispointed by that (but in fact it can act as a reference for further research on AMAZON !)"
2,Loose fit? Should I have stayed with Canon?,"I didn't want to pay a lot for a Canon battery grip so I went for the Opteka. I previously owned two Canon brand grips and I was a little unsettled to find that with the Opteka I couldn't make a tight fit with the base of the camera-in other words, if you held it up you could see light coming through between the grip and the camera bottom. Also, the tripod thumbscrew wouldn't tighten any more and I was afraid to use more muscle lest I strip or crack something. And the battery insertion method from the side is borderline Rube Goldberg. Maybe I shouldn't have been so cheap?"
3,Where's my next issue?,"I love Tennis Magazine, but I seem to be having trouble with missed issues. I know they only put out 8 issues per year, but I renewed my subscription on Aug. 29th. It is now Sept. 30, and I still have not received the next issue. Surely one got skipped. That should mean an extra issue, since I paid for a year... we'll see."
5,An original approach to a classic subject,"Plenty of books recount what happened the night the Titanic sank, but this one does something different. It traces how people have understood that night, mostly in the United States, in the decades since. For example, the Titanic figured into the arguments of both opponents and supporters of women's suffrage in 1912. It entered into African American culture in the form of folk songs and spoken-word poetry (the precursor to rap). It's been the subject of poems, novels, songs, musicals, and (of course) movies. James Cameron's 1997 film--the highest grossing movie of all time--is just one attempt to make the disaster speak to contemporary concerns.With intelligence and wit, Biel shows that many meanings can come from an event. If you want to read a narrative account of the Titanic disaster, try ""A Night To Remember."" But for the hows and whys of remembrance, read this wonderfully researched book, which is gracefully written and often funny."
2,Thoroughly boring,"If by ""academic"" some of the previous reviewers meant hopelessly dry and equally trite, I'll add a resounding ""you bet."" Biel represents a reprehensible trend making its way through the academy, one which chooses to focus exclusively on how events are interpreted instead of what they are. It's a convenient excuse to study pop culture and enforce fashionable academic relativism for most, and Mr. Biel is no exception.Still, all of this I could excuse if the book offered anything resembling relevance. Instead, it's entirely composed of trivia: a virtual catalogue (and not much better written) of anything ever said about the ""Titanic"" disaster, which leaves one with no impression of what this was all about. I've given Mr. Biel two stars for managing to avoid the unreadable jargon that characterizes much of the work done in his field today, but potential readers should be aware that this book, despite its excessive and anal documenting, offers no thesis worth mentioning."
3,The lamp Issue is VERY REAL...don't minimize it !,"I too overall love the TV. But the let down is the lamp unit issue...it has a short life span. We purchased our TV in Nov'05...and lamp went out Aug'06.And the Service stinks...at least at Sears. The TV went out on 8/15, I called on 8/15 to inform Sears my lamp went out. They refused to send me a replacement lamp but had to come out and check the TV first...which happenen on 8/23 and now we have to wait until they return with the lamp on 8/30. OUTRAGEOUS !I wish I would have known about this lamp issue...I would have never purchased the TV...the great picture & features don't out way the potential of the lamp blowing at any given moment."
1,Absolute piece of junk,"Had a 52HM94. Bulb blew at 6 months, light engine failed at one year. Replaced with a 52HM95 by Toshiba. Bulb blew on that after 9 months. Really, really bad TVs after about 5 good Toshibas over the years. I'm amazed they can keep selling these things. I will never, ever buy a Toshiba again."
3,"great set, other than","PRO's - Great picture. Clear and bright. HD is just unbeliviable!Con's - None so farThis is a great TV. The menus are simple and easy to work, the setup is easy, and the picture is great.All I can say...glad I bought it!"
1,59HM95 Very Poor Lamp Life and Customer Support,"After purchasing this television in late 2005, we've had to replace the lamp (bulb) three times! The second lamp (bulb) we purchased in December 2007 lasted for less than 90 days after it was installed! At $250 - $300 a each, this is adding a lot to the cost of ownership. March 6, 2008, when I went to the Toshiba website I found Toshiba added a two year extended warranty to the lamp; however, when I called Toshiba customer service I was told that the exteneded warranty was only for the ORIGINAL lamp. Since I am on my THIRD lamp it doesn't apply to me. Please don't take my word for it, read other reviews from Toshiba DLP owners who are having the same or similar problems BEFORE you buy! Buyer beware."
5,Great product. Works as advertised.,"My wife and I hated the idea of having to install one of the other popular can crushers on the wall of our kitchen and, frankly, dreaded even worse, the idea of having to go out the garage to crush all the cans that regularly collect on the kitchen counter top, next to the sink.This crusher is nice, in that it is completely portable, and can be stowed away when not in use. It does take a bit of a 'touch' to get the cans lined up well enough to 'pull-n'smash', but if you have an IQ in the neighborhood of triple digits or more? It's a piece of cake.Great product."
2,Doesn't work very well,"I purchased this can crusher because I did NOT want a wall-mounted crusher. K. Exline has already written an excellent review explaining why this crusher simply doesn't work well, but it bears repeating: this can crusher requires more time and effort than a wall unit, and it can't handle non-standard sized cans. The crusher doesn't even do all the work for you; it sort of smashes the can from the side, and to get the can truly flat you have to remove it from the crusher and stomp on it. When I pressed hard on the handle to crush the can, it would make an ominous creaking sound, as though it was being strained almost to the breaking point, which made me afraid that it would be easily broken. I only used this can crusher for a few weeks before I got tired of the extra work and just bought a wall-mounted crusher, which I should have done from the beginning. The wall-mounted crushers are sturdy metal and cost about 50% less, too."
5,With basic understanding of electronics this book is great,Unlike other amplifier books this skips all the math. It focuses on topology of amplifier design. To make your own from the book you would need to know some EE math to figure everything out. If you understand how basic components like capacitors and transistors work this book is amazing. There is also a lot of incite about high end audio products available and dismisses many myths. I'm a third year electrical engineering student and this book was great. It is definitely not for beginners but great for everyone else.
4,Can't understand it!!,"This book is targeted on people with a basic knowledge of electronics, which, unfortunately I don't have...... But still I fully enjoyed the first couple of chapters where it explained a lot about why building your own amp is better than buying a commercial brand. For now, I'm actually searching for an electronics basics book so I can go back to this book and really enjoy it, and perhaps, build my own power amp!!"
1,Don't buy this book,"This book builds on Douglas Self's concepts and copy a great part of its content from this author. The circuit simulations that were done by the author are misleading and full of concept errors. Some of the schematics simply won't work because there are terrible flaws not addressed by the author due to his limited technical knowledge on the subject. Other circuits are obsolete or no longer used in the market due to limitations in performance.Concluding, there is nothing ""high-end"" in its contents. The text is a bad introduction of power amplifiers even for novices. Buy another good books on the subject, but not this one."
5,Excellent Book,"I have found this book to be great, I have used a few of the designs and they work for me, I've built several Guitar amplication devises, and sold them to friends for the price of materials. If you have a basic knowledge of Electronics, and wish to experiment with the designs, this is the book for you...."
3,Only good for electronic engineers,"As a learning audiophile, thought this book would give me some electronic knowledge. WRONG, book is useless for anything less than an electronic engineer. Schmatics lost me. Author has an ugly attitude about tube gear. Author contradicts every audio specification I have every learned, may be right, but hard to believe a single voice.I purchased this book in October, 2001. My copy now on sale ...Hope it will be a valuable reference for your library."
2,30% and done,"I only got through 30% of the book. I had pushed myself to that point. I was frustrated with the writing style, finding it hard to follow and had not yet encounteered a character I found likable. I decided not to waste my time and read further."
5,still recommending it . . .,I read this book in 1993 for a class in college and I am still recommending it - it was so real and so well written. The whole story affected me then and continues to do so.
5,An amazing novel of politics and loss.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a remarkable work about politics and the scarring of souls by loss. Doctorow's prose amazes in its fluidity. He shifts among narrative voices with ease, and provides a powerful sense of the personal drama behind one of the larger social dramas of our century."
3,Lavish exhibit of American freedom in describing one's quest for voice of undeniable importance,"Narrator implies that the US government may not hear the voice of God but certain talented immigrants who have been snubbed by the American society will see to it that they have a leverage. As much as many of the passages were exhilarating to read and ponder I could not escape the fact that the whole mindset of Daniel's narration was similar to the third world South Korea's first President Seung Man Rhee who from time to time in his tactics made undercurrent implication that ""If we don't like you, we'll communize."" Needless to say, this was Pres. Rhee's private thought and he was ousted from his Office and was thereafter exiled to Hawaii."
2,Disconcertingly Slight,"I had high hopes for this novel, arriving on my doorstop with a flurry of peer-approval. However, the book does not add up the the sum of its parts--it seems slipshop at times, especially in the rendering of Daniel's change from regretful, damaged son to sixties radical. Perhaps it's dated--the metafictional techniques, especially the shifts from first to third person and back again, lack the force they may once have had--it seems quaint, and is not very effective."
2,Novel or Thesis?,"This book reads much like a rough draft of a grad thesis, which is part of the premise as Doctorow's protragonist Daniel (aka Rosenbergs' son) works on a research paper, trying to make sense of his past. That is to say, it is quite boring and at times, quite desultory. It took me over a year to finish this book - expect it to be boring.The story concerns itself with the fate of the Rosenberg children (""Isaacsons""), who are seriously dysfunctional individuals - spiritually disconnected and morally confused, despite the facade of Daniel's conventional adult life. The book takes on many issues particular to the Cold War period - the New Left, activism, and the blinding of justice by reactionary ideology. None of these ideas are analyzed in a very interesting way, and Doctorow's prose is not exactly melodious. Just my reaction - many people will find this book intriguing. Its subject matter, anyway, is plenty to chew on."
2,Brilliant but too disturbing,"I wanted to love this book, just as I loved Ragtime. Doctorow shows his brilliance in his use of words, his character development, and his knowledge of history, but even though he has tremendous compassion for his characters, he also has moments of an underlying sadism that is offensive and disturbing. Also I was annoyed by the literary conceit of the constant shift in narration, changing from paragraph to paragraph at times; I found it jarring and ineffective. In the end I was so troubled by this book that I couldn't finish it.4 stars for brilliance; 0 stars for an enjoyable read."
2,Sordid Tale,"The story of the Rosenberg trial is certainly an interesting and important topic for a novel, but I hated the way Doctorow portrayed the characters. Aside from his exasperating writing style, Doctorow's characterizations of the Isaacsons bordered on the obscene. I did not care for any of the members of this family - not even the children. Daniel's cruelty to his wife cannot be excused by his experiences, and his and Susan's arrogance and self-importance made them very unlikeable. Of course, it probably wasn't the author's intention to make the Isaacsons warm and cuddly, but he could've restrained from making them so despicable."
2,Book of Daniel,"This book is not in ""Very Good"" condition. The pages are all bent and there's so much writing throughout it. I could have paid less for a copy of better quality."
5,a true delight!,we were very pleased to have found these through amazon! we love the taste! my kids love them with milk.
5,perfect for chocolate-making,I had only used plastic molds before and this is much nicer. non toxic also makes me feel good. the shapes are cute and hold up well. i highly recommend this product.
4,Plenitude Poster,"This was a lovely poster, just beautiful. I got it for my Step-Dad who restores canoes and he loved it."
2,A disapointement,Saw Ruthie live in a show with several other great performers and went looking for a CD. I don't know if I just picked the wrong one but I have never been able to sit through the whole thing.
4,Her Live Performances Are MUCH better than studio recordings...,"I have seen Ruthie live and have viewed all live performances on YouTube, etc.Her live performances are MUCH, MUCH better than her studio recordings.I have all of her CDs and herstudio performances/recordings seem to restrict her voice, singing, and personality too, too much.She is truly a phenomenal singer (the best pure, natural, and real singer out there these days) and outstanding electric and acoustic guitar player as well as an excellent pianist.And, boy, what a personality!!!PLEASE, GO SEE HER 'LIVE' EVERYBODY and HEAR THE REAL THING!!!(Or at least check out her live performances online - especially those at the NYC Living Room...)"
4,Happy Accident,"About once a month I go to my local used record store to see what they're selling for under $5.00. Yesterday I was lucky enough to find this CD. Thus far, it's one of the stand-outs of what I brought home with me. I'm already looking forward to searching out and finding her new album as well. Ruthie has a great voice and is a wonderful tallent but in my ears, what makes this album so good is the fact that she doesn't over sing the music. There's not a lot of ""showing off"" or vocalizing for the sake of vocalizing. She sings wonderfully throughout and is able to groove and swing with the best of them. This is a great soul album. Mostly laid back tunes. I look forward to hearing more recordings by Ruthie (I'm thinking I'll track down ""The Truth"" and probably pay full price!) - Keep up the good work, girl... You earned me as a fan yesterday (and I'm starting to spread the word today!)"
2,The Phenomenal Ruthie Foster,"Disappointing. Only cared for about 2 songs, which were the ""preview"" songs that prompted me to purchase the cd."
5,Phenomenal!,"I heard Ruthie Foster in an interview on NPR (National Public Radio), on ""Studio 360"". NPR has done this to me before; hooked me on a sound I'd never experienced previous. I have this CD in my cubicle at work and it is all I can do not to dance or sing out loud. I am going to have to get a copy for the car and one for the house I think. This was my first Foster experience and it is as profound as Bob Marley singing ""No Woman, No Cry"". And Maya Angelou's poem ""Phenomenal Woman"" set to song by Foster is...I don't have the words."
1,Shocking,"I set the machine up, put the pads on my forehead to help with my migraines, the pads kept falling off (they weren't sticky enough)and the instant I turned it on it kept shocking me. I had it really low and it continued to shock me. I turned it all the way down and felt nothing what so ever. I do not recommend wasting your money. You'll continue to spend money if you buy this machine, cause you will have to buy new pads every time you use it."
2,Mild,"This product did work but basically it lacks any real punch. Batteries run out quickly and the pads did not last long and gave me a nasty shock about the third time I used them. Long story short if you regret buying something and are disappointed overall it's hard to recommend a product. Yes it was cheap so at least there is that, next time I will spend more and go for a real model."
4,Buen producto,"Compacto, diverso y trabaja muy bien. Puedes poner los pads en diferentes areas, haciendo que trabajen diferente tipos de musculos a la vez."
2,There is better programs,I felt that this program moved to quickly and didn't review enough. Hearing a word in a foreign language two times isn't enough to retain the information. The dialouges didn't help much because they were teaching you whole phrases. It would be more helpful to learn what specific words to use in order to form the phrase that you would need in your conversation.
3,part of the whole,"Was not displayed as to be part of a whole contraption, when it was recieved by the recipient, she became aware that it was only partial, that made me feel inadequate"
3,the augmented reissue of Bay Cities BCD 1009,"Don't be mislead by the info given under ""On this CD"". It is faulty. I've checked directly on the Citadel website, and the disc contains only the material listed in the ""listen to samples"" section.In fact this disc, Citadel 88116, is the reissue of Bay Cities BCD 1009, augmented of The Lament for Beowulf and shorn of the String Quartet from 1923 (now on Citadel 88119 with the Quartets of Randall Thompson, a more logical coupling anyway,Thompson: String quartet No1; Hanson: String Quartet in one movement Op23). It is a live recording made in 1977 by the so-called World Youth Symphony Orchestra of Interlochen, the youth orchestra gathered every summer at the Interlochen National Music Camp, Michigan. See my review under the Bay Cities entry,Hanson: A Sea Symphony (No. 7) on Words of Walt Whitman, Pan and the Priest, Variations on Two Ancient Hymn Tunes."
1,Terrible,After one month my hair has begun to fall out. I went on the Internet and found that other people had the same experience. This product should be pulled from the marketand these claims investigated!!!!!
1,NSM on the WEN,"Not so much...I was all about the guarantee, however after returning it, I was out about $16 for shipping back & forth. First, I used the Cucumber and it left the back of my neck with a slight chemical burn - ow! I'm thinking when reading the instructions, how they keep saying ""use more""...just seems like they are just trying to ""sell more""...most good products, the less you use the better. They do have some good sulfate hair products out there. You're better off going to an outlet type store so you can get your full money back."
1,...go figure,"It seems that all these ""wonder"" products work wonders for everyone but me. I was so hoping this product would make my hair shiny and healthy like the gals they use on their infomercials. It didn't. I'm 1/2 Japanese and my hair has always been super thick but since I've gotten older, my hair texture has definitely changed. It's coarse and frizzy and kind of wavy (and not wavy in a good way, either!). Also, the smell...to put it mildly I don't care for it...at all. It smells like really strong cherry cough syrup mixed with Vicks VapoRub. I'm sure I would like the other scents but don't want to pay for more if it's not going to give me the results they claim. I'm wondering if you only get the results if you blow dry your hair after shampooing, because I don't dry my hair. If anyone knows, I would appreciate any info. Thanks a bunch!"
2,Dry my hair,"It work well the first week ;) By my second week using this shampoo, fallowing the instructions very carefully got rely disappointed when my hair got started to get dry. So I will not purchase this again:("
2,So so,"I ordered the Fig after I'd been using the Sweet Almond Mint for a week or so. The first use of the Fig left my hair totally full of flakes (this is never an issue for me any other time). I am not sure if it really dried out my scalp or what but the difference was night and day compared to my use of the Sweet Almond Mint. After combing my hair many, many, many times to remove flakes, I rewashed the next morning with the Sweet Almond and my hair was good again. I am now using the Fig on the back of my hair and the sweet almond mint on my scalp & sides of my head. This gives me the best of both worlds...no dry scalp, but the lasting scent of the Fig cleanser."
2,Nice but not worth the money,I have purchased and used these products for nearly a year. It is a nice cleansing conditioner -- but the rest of the line is just line-extension profit-seeking. In the past month I have chosen to use the neew Loreal Cleansing Conditioner instead -- Less than $6 (albeit for a smaller amount) but every single bit as good. AB
2,Kind of dissapointed over all the hype,I was excited about getting this product after reading all the reviews and even my hair dresser said she loved it and would buy nothing else for herself.After the first few uses it was great but the longer I used it the dirtier my hair looked and felt.My hair did not feel clean and I know its not supposed to suds up so not sure if my mind was playing tricks on me or what but I did not care for it at all. I ended up giving it to my mother to try and see if maybe it was just me and havent heard if she likes or dislikes it.I think it would have been better for me if I would have alternated every other wash with this and maybe some actual shampoo. Alot people love it and thats great but I will not be buying anymore
4,Great Product,"I love all of the WEN products! I normally use the Sweet Almond Mint, but wanted to try one of the others. Fig is great! It's very moisturizing! I have very curly hair and it makes my curls soft and defined! Thank you WEN!"
2,definitely different from shampoo,"WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner 16ozIt is like washing your hair with a conditioner instead of a shampoo. There is absolutely no lather and it is very soft when finished. It does make your hair softer and shinier, which is what I was looking for in this product. I chose not to use it everyday, but once a week instead. I don't think I'll be buying it again, I think it is overpriced."
2,YUCK,I love Wen Lavendar cleansing conditioner but the Fig is just DISGUSTING. I abhor the smell! It makes me want to vomit. It also made my hair greasier than the other Wen products.
2,Not thrilled,"I purchased this product because it was offered in a larger size bottle and thought I would try a different scent. For some reason it didn't live up to the appeal that I had for the almond scented shampoo, and it left my hair somewhat drier."
5,Bad Hair Days Without Wen,"I have been using Wen for 2 years now. Ran out and had to use something else...never again! It just reminded me how hard It was to get a comb through my hair. By the way, I have naturally curly hair and loads of It.This was my first time using the Fig. I happen to like the Mint and Pumpkin Cleansing Conditioner better though."
2,Using WEN gave me dandruff,I have used WEN (Fig) for a month. I really don't see a difference in my hair tecture with WEN. Less expensive salon products work just the same. I am upset about the dandruff. I will not use WEN again and would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Skeptical at First,"When I first heard about something called a ""conditioning cleanser"" for hair I was skeptical. My reason for trying it is I have my hair professionally colored about every six weeks and was tired of the color fading. I had heard that since this product doesn't lather, it wouldn't strip the hair of its color so quickly. It was weird the first time I used it because there was no lather. I followed the instructions and was surprised that my hair was actually clean. I have been using this product for approximately 6 weeks, and my hair color hasn't faded nearly as much as it would have using regular shampoo and conditioner. The fragrance is pleasant too."
2,"Isn't working for me, it may not work for you","Just wanted to start by saying, I have ethic, unprocessed, non-dyed hair. I bought this product with high hopes. I had listen to others hype it up and was willing to give it a try. Much to my regret my hair is duller than I've ever seen it. The fig smell is a bit much as well (It's quite medicinal smelling) although I could have forgave that if the product really made my hair look and feel healthy. It's only been a little over a week which isn't long but I've now had less than healthy looking hair for a week, why continue. There are a lot of raving reviews here so I thought I would add this one to tell a tale of the other side."
3,"Great product, but it stinks!",I love Wen hair products but I think people should know that the Fig Cleansing Conditioner does not smell good at all. I'm going to stick with Lavender and Almond Mint.
1,Horrible Stuff!,"No way! Bought it and HATE IT. My hair feels like one big giant tub of crisco. So greasy. My husband didn't know I was using it and after 10 days said ""what is wrong with your hair lately, when was the last time you washed it"". Enough said!"
2,So So,"So I saw the infomercial and I was sold!I usually am with any infomercials.I have been using it and it doesnt smell that great, but not bad. Not that its advertised as smelling great.But it is advertised as protecting your hair color and for me it hasnt made a significant difference.Would I buy it again? Not personally. Would I recommended? No.Sorry!"
2,I ordered this because I thought it was for your hair and it says for your body ?,I was excited to try and when I got it it said for body :( did not want body and Have not heard back from this person ....
3,Nothing spectacular,Not impressed with this at all. No real difference or improvement in the moisture or curl of my hair. Back to the never-ending search for the perfect curly hair product....
2,Not sure about this stuff....,"I was excited to receive the Wen fig sent, wanted to try this one step daily haircare product. I don't have problem hair, I don't color it or put much products in it. I have never had a problem with flakes or dandruff. The first time I tried Wen, I immediately noticed large flakes coming off my scalp. I figured at first maybe it was ""cleansing"" off of all the buildup and I stuck it out for about a week. I was really conscious about doing deep scalp massages in the shower with the product and leaving in in for the suggested time. After 2 weeks, I was sick of the chunky flakes sitting on my shoulders and went back to my old products. After only one application, I was flake free! I guess I just bought the most expensive shaving cream! And by the way, my mother always told me to stick to the products that you like, and my suave sleek shampoo and conditioner has given me compliments for years!"
1,DONT LIKE IT,"I HATED THIS PRODUCT, IT STINKS IN MY OPINION, IT IS TOO MINTY AND TINGLES MY SKIN WHEN IM SHOWERING TO WASH OUT THE PRODUCT, IT DOESNT MAKE THE HAIR FEEL CLEAN AS A SHAMPOO DOES, I DIDNT LIKE IT IT AT ALL."
3,I would have run out in a half a month,"I do like the product, but if you have long and thick hair, by following the directions, you will run out quickly.That's my only complaint. If I had shorter hair, then it would not be so bad, but I have long thick wavy hair. The 16 oz bottle would have been gone in two weeks with cleansing every two to every three days."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this after seeing the informercial and reading reviews online. I have a lot of hair that is ofter dry so I try not to shampoo my hair everyday. This product is good the very first day you use it, but I could not use it two days in a row. It left my hair looking dirty and greasy. I followed the instructions to the letter. I'm not sure who this product is for but my hair does not normally look greasy. This was very disappointing. It also does smell like a mixture of cough syrup and Vix vapor rub."
2,Not that thrilled,"my mom and i both used this product and werent that thrilled. gave it two more chances. still not that great. it left grease spots in our hair and made it flat. although, my aunt used it and she loves it. she said it gave her hair much needed moisture."
5,Great for You Hair!,I love Wen Fig products. I've been using it for seven months now and I won't go back to using regular shampoo and conditioner. This product does both! It cleanses and conditions at the same time. I have curly hair so the Wen Fig conditioner works great for me. Love it!!
3,okay,For the money this cost its not worth it. My hair feels drier at times. I would not buy this again.
4,Good for not striping color from dyed hair,Good for not striping color from dyed hair. Other kinds have a more pleasing smell. This one is a little medicinal smelling. A little pricey
1,The worst ever....,"Purchased this product for my wife after reading the ""rave"" reviews. This terrible product caused her hair to be frizzy, unmanageable, and has the worst odor. This is the most expensive shampoo ever that does nothing but look nice in its bottle....I DO NOT recommend this product."
4,Smells awful but works well,"The FIG cleansing conditioner is really good for my dry color-treated hair. It leaves it shiny, and it gets better and better with each use. The only bad thing is - the smell. I've tried other WEN products and liked the scents very much, but the FIG scent is AWFUL. It smells like putrified fruit of some type. Even my husband said my hair didn't smell ""pretty"" like it normally does - after I used this.One other problem with this (and all WEN products) is the price. WEN tells you to use quite a bit on your hair each time, and considering the size of this - it's REALLY expensive. It doesn't last long AT ALL. Which is a shame, since it works so well. I think the WEN people need to lower their prices!"
4,WEN Fig Cleansing Conditioner,"Though a bit expensive, a little goes a long way and your hair feels and looks clean. I now use this more often than shampoo because it saves on hair color. My hair feels silky and even seems thicker. Give this a try and you will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Wen Fig Conditioning Cleanser,"This product outperformed my expectation. I am very pleased with the results. Cleaned, conditioned and softened my hair.. Will definitely recommend.."
1,Disappointed,I've used the Wen Sweet Almond Mint for about 6 months now & I loved it! After doing some research I learned the Sweet Almond Mint is not for my hair type (thick coarse). So I switched to the Fig Cleansing conditioner & my hair has done a 180! It was soft & not as difficult to style/ manage. Now it seems extra dry & almost impossible to style/ manage! Ive only bought one bottle of the Fig (Thank Goodness!) so I guess I only wasted about $40 but that's nothing compared to the difference I feel in my hair & the possible damage it has caused!
3,"Works well, smells weird.","This one smells weird, it reminds me of a bad cough medicine.I really like Wen,and have been using the sweet almond mint one. I don't have oily hair, so I can even cleanse every other day after abandoning traditional shampoo. I do have curly hair that's hard to control, and this stuff keeps it soft and tamed. I don't find that the product really leaves my hair smelling pretty (not that my hair ends up smelling bad, the mint one just doesn't have a lasting fragrance). I tried the fig fragrance in the hopes it would leave my hair smelling nice. Luckily, while the product smells weird in the shower, the smell similarly doesn't linger."
5,Life changing!!!,"I have very thick unruly curly hair that was always VERY hard to maintain and tame. This would cause me to spend countless hours straightening my hair leaving it dry and damaged. When I did wear it natural and curly I would have to use moose and hair spray and then my color looked terrible and my hair felt like straw. ALL THIS NO MORE!!! WEN is life changing I have never before been able to leave my hair all natural and have it look amazing, and it FEELS amazing!! I'd say about 85% less frizz. My curly hair feels soft and its sooo shinny!!! i am soo so so so so happy with the WEN Fig cleanser! I would recommend this product to EVERYONE! I am so happy with it I an thinking about buying it by the gallon. :-)"
4,Good results.,"I like the results I get from this product. My hair feels clean, but silky, not strippd or dried out. Since I go to the gym a lot and wet/rinse my hair after every single sweaty workout, I like that I can use this as a leave in conditioner even when I'm not washing my hair. Makes getting the comb through my long wet curly hair a breeze without weighing it down with a heavy or greasy ""overkill"" product. Not crazy about the scent of the fig cleanser, but once it is worked in and my hair is drying the scent just about disapears, which for me with regard to this product, is a good thing. When I buy Wen again, and I will, I will try one of the other scents."
4,"Smells like cough drops to me, but it does work","I plan on trying other scents of this product. I have processed/damaged (frequently colored)fine curly hair. This has eliminated the need not only for seperate shampoo/conditioner, but also leave-in treatments, detangler etc. I feel it works very well, but there is a learning curve involved. You need to figure out how to use it best for your hair and NOT to use it like shampoo. It HAS to soak on your hair for awhile to work.yes it is pricey, but for me it replaces three or four products so I feel thats ok.The only real con for me is the smell - it reminds me of cough drops or kids medicine. That is of course a personal issue, so others might love the smell. I will try other scents next time."
2,"Works well as a cleanser, but smells HORRIBLE","I love all four of the other Wen cleansing conditioners. I alternate between them because using just one tends to make my hair feel a bit weighed-down after a couple of cleansings. I bought the set of five because I thought I'd like to add Fig to the lineup.UGH. Imagine this: You are eating a Fig Newton. At first it tastes like scruptious figs. Then you realize that someone has injected menthol flavor into the middle of it. If this sounds like it would taste and smell horrible, you're right.Fig Cleansing Conditioner smells like delicious figs, plus menthol. EW. I had to wash with the Lavender flavor to get the smell out! Two thumbs down on this one, Chaz Dean.I gave it two stars instead of one because it's a good cleanser, minus the smell."
1,Not worth the money!,"I think that all of the reviews must have been written by people with the company as well.Not only did I not notice a difference, but I had to stop using it because the smell is so bad. I could literally not stand the smell of my own hair!!!Needless to say I have an almost full bottle of this nasty stuff."
1,Didnt like it,"I did not like this product. The smell is very nice and I had high hopes... but after my daughter and I both using it it gave us BOTH poofy, fluffy, frizzy hair and flakes. I tried it four times and it just got worse each time. I am returning it."
3,still on the fence with this one!,"I will update my review after using this a bit more, but after a few tries, i am not convinced that this is going to replace normal shampoo and conditioner for me. i may use this and mix it up every other time or something. I am finding that my hair still feels a bit greasy and dirty after showering and using this product. i have rinsed extra well and not left any in as a leave in and i still feel my hair is a bit dull, heavy and weighed down and not ultra clean. I do understand that this is a lot better for my hair and will help the color last longer, so i am going to continue to try it out. The smell is nice and clean and fresh, i am not getting any tingle from the product as i thought i was going to on my scalp. it feels as if it rinses out well, and i do not have the tangles that i would normally have if i were to skip conditioner after shampooing. I will update in a few weeks when i have used it more."
1,Forget the Fig,Avoid the fig. Smells like wet dog. I have loved WEN products for over a year and thought I would try this instead because it was supposed to be good for color treated hair. Can't wait until it's gone.
1,WEN fig cleansing conditioner sucks.,"Didn't do anything to my hair except kind of make it look dry at the roots & ends, will not recommend or buy again."
1,This product causes hair loss!,"I had a disturbing side effect from using this product - substantial hair loss. Washing my hair with WEN resulted in handfulls of my hair coming out - even my husband noticed that my hair had gotten thinner. After using WEN just a few times, I became alarmed. At first, I thought something else might be triggering the hair loss, but WEN was the only change in my routines. I stopped using WEN and stopped losing hair. Although the product left my hair shinier and more manageable, who wants less hair to manage? I hope my (until recently) thick hair comes back.I've looked around various review and message boards and found that I am far from alone with this complaint. An alarming number of purchasers had the same experience. I wish I had done more research and not believed the hype."
1,Terrible Smell,"I bought the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner after watching the infomercial for it. I loved it! The only problem is the small bottle they give you is supposed to be a 30 day supply. There is no way, if using the recommended amount, it will last a month, and so I bought this as a supplement. It smells terrible. Right out of the bottle it is strong, sickly-sweet smell. When you start using it, the menthol smell comes out and the two do not mix well. I am throwing the full bottle out. I can't stand using it."
1,Not a happy camper,"I just used the Wen hair care conditioner this morning that I had my husband order for me for Christmas. I have little bit longer than shoulder length bottled blonde highlightend hair and is very fine. I saw this product on the TV. one Sunday as I was flipping through the channels and stopped to listen and watch the videos. I also checked out online and watched the video clips. I have always had difficult fine split end hair and always looking for help to improve it. I have to say I am extremly dissappointed in the results I have. My hair doesn't even look clean and feels greasy and no volume and just looks terriable. For the price of one bottle of this product it should be amazing and due what it has claimed to do. I am going to email the company and demand my husband get is money back. I have better results with a much cheaper shampoo like Sauve,I will stick with that from now on. Sincerely, Not a happy customer at all :-("
2,Just Ok....,"I bought this product with high hopes for my long, thick hair, but you've got to use so much of it, that its just ridiculous--the directions say something like 20-30 pumps for one wash. My hair still felt a little slimy afterwards, too. I am a hair stylist, so I've tried many different professional products, and although the concept of this product is good, I just can't see the value in it when you've got to use so much of it every time you wash your hair. You're better off investing in a very gentle shampoo and a rich, moisturizing conditioner..."
1,Disappointed :(,"I bought Wen to control frizzy hair & I'm disappointed in this shampoo. My hair does feel soft& clean after using, but it's still frizzy in appearance even if I leave some in as a conditioner! It seems very similar to mane & tail conditioner."
4,Not quite sure...,"Have used this product 3 times and not quite sure if it is for me. Yes, your hair is clean afterward (one of my worries). Love the smell and the way it feels on the scalp."
1,Pewwww!,"don't buy this! It stinks! I will finish using it due to the cost, but I have to plug my nose every time I do!"
3,Smells like Robitussin,"I had heard such rave reviews about this conditioner that I committed and bought the huge 32oz bottle. The first night I went to use it I was very excited about the transformation that was about to take place. Fast forward to my first pump. Holy...what?? This stuff smells exactly like Robitussion cough drops. Ick. Ok fast forward now to a couple weeks and a few uses later, yea it's a good product. I use the gazillion pumps it tells you to use and also use 1 pump as a leave-in and my hair needs absolutely no other product to look really great. I've gotten a few compliments on my hair since starting to use the product, in fact. But, really...Robitussin? I hate to think what this stuff smelled like before all the hours put in at the lab formulating a scent. Some other reviewer mentioned it has a ""natural"" scent. I'd say that's accurate if where you live the trees smell like cough drops and the grass like Vick's."
4,I like it,"I have long thick dry and very damaged hair from highlights. My hair started to break so bad I didn't know what to do. I ordered Wen. It does tingle and it does smell like medication however once I dry and style it I don't notice the smell at all. It does make my hair very soft. Hopefully it will help with the breakage. I do really like it, it is just too much $ since I need like at 40 pumps. I would not use this this if you have fine, thin hair. But give it a try if you have thick or curly."
3,Wen Fig Cleansing,"It's okay, but really it's nothing more than conditioner and overpriced. When it was shipped, the nozzle hadn't been locked and almost 1/2 of the product had leaked into the shipping container. I won't be buying anymore of this product."
1,"Save your money, this stuff is crap.","This product dried my hair out so badly. The first time I used it I thought, great, my hair feel smooth and silky. Well, it must be made so you have to use it everyday, or with heat, to get this effect. Day 2 and 3 after using this, my hair is dry, frizzy and tangles easily. There are many cheaper sulfate and detergent free conditioners on the market. Shop around and save your money. This product is crappy in my opinion. It has ruined my normally, thick, soft curly long hair. I'm going back to using my original conditioner. Even before using WEN, I only used shampoo maybe twice a month. I've always just used conditioner, massaging it into my scalp and letting it sit before rinsing. That works better than WEN. WEN is a total rip off."
3,Not a huge fan - but it's okay,"This product works okay. I just don't think it works well on oily hair. Maybe it's just me, but it didn't work on my daughters dry hair well either."
3,Cleans hair,"It cleans the hair without the suds. However, my hair felt a little rough even though my hair is naturally soft. It shipped quickly."
5,very good product,I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. I have frizzy hair and when I wash my hair with it the hair feels very smooth and soft. I love the fact that cleanser and conditioner are all in one. Saves time. Great product.
2,Not sure what the hype is about,"I Used the product exactly as the directions indicated and it gave my hair body...but left it feeling oily and heavy. I am allergic to many shampoos (typically cheaper ""non-salon"" shampoos) and breakout with a rash on my forehead. This shampoo did the same. This caught me by surprise because the shampoo is supposed to be all natural...???"
5,Made my dry hair so soft,"My hair was so dry and brittle from all of my coloring and heat styling, but my hair gets so poufy I have to flat iron it. I've tried every product and nothing seemed to get my hair as soft as I wanted.I also had to use a ton o9f styling products to get my hair looking decent. I noticed a difference in my hair right away, it was so soft and manageable.Since I have been using the fig cleansing conditioner, I no longer flat iron my hair because it is not poufy anymore, and I have thrown away all of my styling products, even when I skip the blow dry my hair still looks good."
1,What a waste of money!,"I purchased the Wen after seeing it on an infomercial. My two daughters and I do not like the way our hair feels after using it. The no lather cleansing is equivalent to skipping the shampoo and only using conditioner. Your hair does NOT feel clean after using it. Although the frizzies may be tamer and your hair does feel soft, on the second day after using it, your hair feels greasy. I can usually go two days without washing my hair with regular shampoo, but with Wen I can't stand my hair the second day. I DO NOT recommend wasting $30 on this product."
1,Very unsatisfied,"I was very excited to try this product. I had seen the infomercials claiming you will have the best hair ever. The first time I used it I was very pleased, my hair seemed more manageable and softer. The second time I used it was another story. I used the exact same amount and rinsed the exact same amount as well. My hair was greasy and weighted down. I am keeping the product (I was given a prompt return RMA from Chaz Dean) in the hopes that maybe it will work for me again one day."
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!!!!,"I have been using for over a year and this is the best group of products I've ever tried (and I'm a true product junkie and have tried almost everything!!) It saves time in my routine and makes my hair feel soft and beautiful! I have thick, coarse, curly, color-treated hair and I use a flat iron regularly to straighten my curls-my hairdresser cannot believe the beautiful condition of my hair since beginning Wen-I take it with me every time! Stick with it for more than 1-2x and use a little more product if you don't think you're getting good results."
1,Definatly not worth losing your hair over,"My friends and I all decided to try out this product. I used the Wen shampoo 3 times and each time, I found a ton of my hair falling out when I had the product in an was combing it.A couple of my friends who have tried it also experienced a ton of hair loss.When reading other reviews, I see there are many other people that have had the same experience as us.Its too expensive and no product is worth losing your hair over."
2,Didn't see a change...,"I bought this for my daughter and I. We both have naturally curly, easily tangled hair. Her hair is thick and coarse, mine is thinner and frizzy. We both blow dry our hair and use flat irons or curling irons on it on a regular basis. Neither of us noticed any difference in results between using salon/store bought shampoos/conditioners, and this. However, this was much more expensive. I know in the commercials they tell you to do a ""blow out"" when drying it, but as anyone knows with our type of hair, ANY product will smooth the hair when you do a blow out. I don't feel it was the shampoo that made the difference. Some people commented on the smell, but it didn't bother us and my boyfriend said my hair smelled good.Overall, I was really disappointed. I have battled frizzy hair all my life and was looking forward to a product that would change all that. This was not it."
5,i love the smmell on this / pomegranite is a little more sweet smelling,"i would say this is a very good if your have ethnic or very course hair. when i use it my hair looks great (my hair=thick/course/dry) , but it did have a slight starch feel to it which I didnt mind bc it still felt better than ever. after using pomegranite it felt more movable and light , which i liked better. pomegranite is def my favorite though . i really love how fig smells tho , so i will use it here and there jus for that lol"
3,Wen for African hair,"For my African American hair this has been the best Wen product by far. I works pretty good as a detangler in the shower, but it makes my hair susceptible to dryness so I try to limit my use to once a week and use with a creme based conditioner and leave in conditioner."
2,Way Too Expensive,"WEN products are just way too expensive. I used the Fig Cleansing Conditioner as instructed and was pleased with the results: less frizzy and calmer. I have thick, coarse, somewhat curly hair. It has been washed and blow dried every day for 35 years and colored for the last 25. It is very dry, and I imagine would benefit from long-term use of WEN. HOWEVER, the cost is prohibitive! Using 20-30 pumps for my short-to-shoulder-length hair, the cost is $4.75-7.07/day, $145-215/month, $1733-2583/year. There is NO WAY I WOULD EVER SPEND $2583 PER YEAR on just hair products! Cuts, color and additional WEN styling products not included. Additionally, product instruction requires 7-11 minutes of ACTIVE hair cleansing time. That's already almost double my normal shower time! (Standard showering not included. Perhaps WEN is worth all of this to some people, but not to me."
4,"Soft hair, weird smell","I have been using the WEN Fig cleansing conditioner for 2 weeks now, and it does a fantastic job of softening and taming my thick, very wavy hair, even in the highest humidity of the summer. However, the smell of this product is not appealing to me at all. I usually like fig scented products, but this, to me, does not smell like fig, but rather like Cherry Mash candy (which I hate). I have to say though, I do not use this product as a cleanser, I use it as a conditioner and leave-in product. The weird fragrance does not seem to linger beyond the shower, so I will continue to use it, and likely reorder more."
4,Jersey Girl,"I love the when products. Everyone tells me how soft may hair is and wonders why with this summer humidity my hair isn't frizzy. I tell them WEN. I have really curly hair that as the humidity grew so did my hair. For example if my hair went to my bra strap in the back, it would creep up to my shoulders by the end of the day. With the Wen products it doesn't creep as much or at all. I just wish the cost would come down so I could afford it better. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 starts. Price is too high."
1,Ugghh!,"I was very excited after seeing the infomecial over and over. I really don't see how this product can be good for ethnic hair, it made mine like straw with this funky build-up. The smell is not all that great either-kinda like Vick's menthol in your hair. Interesting, but not for me."
2,Just not worth the money,"I ordered this from QVC and I have used it several times, not terribly impressed, particularly with the price. Also not sure if my very thick coarse hair is clean. I will not send it back, I can use it as a conditioning treatment but my advice for women with hair like mine is to look for gentler shampoos and wash less often. If you really used the amount of product they recomend you would need 2 full bottles of the stuff a month, to the tune of some 60 bucks. Also the miracle ingredient in it is old fashioned and inexpensive glycerin. Basically a rip-off."
5,"Great, for making Gatorade, anything else","This permits me to indulge my purchase of powdered Gatorade, which saves tons of money. Kitchen funnels are too small."
4,Useful Dictionary,I have purchased this dictionary less than a month ago and I am really happy having it.
3,Not her cup of tea,"I am a big fan. This is just not her best ""voice"". Strauss, Puccini, and the great Russian Album, but leave the Coloratura to Sutherland and Callas."
4,Dove sono Elvino e Gennaro?,"The merits of Renée Fleming's prowess in the bel canto repertoire can be debated ad nauseum. I myself admit to having been skeptical before hearing the disc, but ended up loving it for its heartbreaking pathos, endless legato lines, and the daring (dare I say Caballé-like?) use of her chest voice.My sole complaint with the disc is missing personnel. Kristine Jepson was engaged to sing with Fleming in the Maria Padilla scene, but sadly, no Gennaro or Elvino appear in the Lucrezia Borgia or La sonnambula excepts respectively (the absence of Rodolfo and Teresa is only a minor annoyance). I feel similarly annoyed when sopranos record the Act I finale of La traviata without an Alfredo. Though I realize this is through no fault of the artists, and is most likely the result of recording studios cutting corners, the absence of these roles to interact in the drama leaves the Borgia and Sonnambula scenes sorely lacking for this listener."
2,A disappointing attempt,"This is a disappointing attempt by one of the leading lyric sopranos of the day. There can be no doubt whatsoever that Renee Fleming has a very beautiful and creamy voice. Yet, she is still rather immature as far as musicianship and interpretation are concerned. Here, in these most demanding bel canto arias, she's so bent on parading the beautiful sounds that she is capable of making that she forgets all about style, emotion and individuality. As a result, her singing is bland and unstylish. In fact, it's often ponderous. The vocal line as sung by Fleming lacks vigor and life. Honestly, I don't think this can do."
2,Disappointing,"I must say I've found this new recording to be rather disappointing. I don't think anyone would doubt that Renee Fleming has a beautiful voice. Yet, her singing has become more and more indulgent and riddled with mannerisms over the past few years. Sad to say that such mannerisms have reached a new height here. Some of her exaggerated portamentos and awkward embellishments have even become, in my view, caricatures of the real thing. It is doubly disappointing as Fleming was once a most promising singer..."
2,Not genuine bel canto,"Renee Fleming has a beautiful voice. There's no question about that. However, in this recording, she seems to be more keen on exploiting the sound that her voice can make than giving listeners meaningful interpretations of these difficult arias. As a result, her singing is bland and lacks fire. If ""bel canto"" is merely ""beautiful singing"", then Fleming does come off with flying colors. However, ""bel canto"" actually means much more than that and Fleming's singing and interpretation is deficient in many ways. At the end of the day, other than a beautiful voice, Fleming is unable to create any lasting impression on any of the tracks. I'm afraid that Fleming has to work much harder if she's to sound convincing in this exacting repertoire."
5,Brava Renee!,"This is Bel Canto at its finest! Beautiful, haunting and moving! I love Renee, she's gorgeous, very talented and the best soprano I ever heard!"
4,Brava,The Queen of bel canto remain undisputely Dame Joan Sutherland. But the young Fleming may be her successor.
3,"well done, not great","To compare her to the legends of bel canto is a waste of time. The greatest coloraturas of the last hundred years or so is the great bel canto diva Joan Sutherland and others like Sills and Galli-Curci, and perhaps early Callas.Fleming is not even close. But then, she is the best we have these days.As for Fleming's trill, it's Leontyne Price level...level 5 in a scale of 1-10. Just so interested bel canto buffs want to know, Sill's trill is a 9, Callas an 8, the young Sutherland a 10, while the old Sutherland a 6. On Caballe and Horne, they both are 3 or less - basically trilless. But then, even the legendary Amelita Galli-Curci, who's fioritura is at the same level as Sutherland had not a trill in sight.Just some interesting bel canto trivia from a very old opera buff."
3,not the real thing,"Renee Fleming certainly has a beautiful voice and impeccabletechnique but she is not a natural for this repertoire. Shesomewhat sound small-scaled and mannered lacking the abandonnecessary to bring this music to life. Of course after havingdiscovered this reportoire with such luminaries as Callas,Sutherland, Caballe and Sills one is somewhat spoiled. En-joyable but far from definitive in representing what theelusive 'bel canto' style is all about."
1,Hideous!,"Probably the worst recital I've ever encountered. I have nothing against Mrs Fleming, she is a fine Mozart and Strauss singer but all I hear here are pushed ugly chest notes, even uglier covered high notes and above all fake drama. So dissapointing because she was hailed the worthy successor of Schwarzkopf and Te Kanawa but at least these two ladies knew what music their voice could serve. I wouldn't dare to compare Fleming to Caballe, Callas, Gencer, Sills and Sutherland in bel canto, vocally or dramatically. There are much better newcomers out there who can sing these roles cleanly, sincerely and have a keen sense of the drama."
2,"Great soprano, poor, poor sound quality","It is a shame that such a wonderful voice as Ms Flemings is wasted from the poor sound quality/production that this CD has. To hear her voice one must turn the volume up very high, only to be blasted when the music begins. This is a total waste of a great voice and really is the fault of the producers, not Ms Fleming's."
4,Just Great,I'm not really into opera per se but I do occasionaly induldge. I have listened to this recording while trying to wind down from the day. I have fallen asleep more than three times before hearing the finale; that's good too me. Beautiful singing.
2,NOT THE RIGHT STYLE FOR FLEMING,"I AM THE FIRST TO AGREE THAT FLEMING'S VOICE IS UNMATCHED, BUT THAT IS WITHIN HER REALM. BEL CANTO SHOWS THAT DESPITE HER BEING ABLE TO REACH THE NOTES IT DOESN'T MEAN IN SUITS HER. SHE BELONGS WITH STRAUSS AND MOZART AND DVORAK. SHE DESERVES THAT CREDIT SHE GETS FOR BEING A FULL LYRIC WITH RICH TONES. SHE IS NOT HOWEVER JOAN SUTHERLAND WHO HAD A RICH VOICE AND THE FULL RANGE TO TACKLE BEL CANTO NOR DOES SHE HAVE THE PASSION THAT ALLOWED CALLAS TO RECREATE AND REVAMP THE BEL CONTO AWAY FROM LILY PONS AND ADELINA PATTI. THE CD IS NOT HORRIBLE, HER LUCREZIA BORGIA DOES HAVE IT'S MOMENTS AND THE CD DOES ALLOW A GLIMMER INTO UNCHARTER WATERS WITH DONIZETTI'S MARIA PADILLA (I'M PERSONALLY TRYING TO FIND A GOOD COPY OF THAT OPERA) IT JUST ISN'T HER BEST WORK. I WOULD HOPE, HOWEVER,THAT HER ILL CHOSEN MATERIAL WON'T DETER PEOPLE FROM LISTENING TO HER OTHER WORKS AS THEY DO SHOW A YOUNG LYRIC AT HER BEST!"
1,overrated soprano,"i cannot believe all the publicity one hears about Renee Fleming - based on this album alone she distorts and ruins music that has been very well served by many artists in the past. Apparently she doesn't see that she cannnot measure up in any way to the demands of this music. Swooping and wobbling, crooning, ugh - the new york times reviewer got it right for once - she sounds like she is channeling Sarah Vaughan. One of the worst recordings of anything i have ever heard!!!!!"
4,My review,"I have not listened to this recording yet. However, I am giving Fleming the benefit of the doubt by giving her four stars.I have to clear up some things said by past reviewers. To Dr. Nicholas S. Weber (if he is even a doctor), Sills was not the greatest second-rate soprano to make sallies into the bel canto repertory. That would be Ms. Fleming. Sills was definitely a first-rate soprano on par with Callas, Sutherland, and Caballé. To adelefalk, Sills' trill is the real thing. Fleming only wishes she could have a trill as nice as Sills'. Also, this adelefalk is a Fleming sycophant. She reviews many Fleming recordings, sometimes twice, and always gives the soprano five stars."
1,I agree with the below review,"The below review is right on. It echoes all the numerous past reviews on this site that have lambasted this horrible recording. Fleming shames herself by singing with her awful mannerisms. Someone with better taster than she had should have reined in her excesses. Heaven knows she neeeded it.Let's hope her upcoming Handel recital disc and her fall 2004 performances of ""Rondelinda"" at the Met don't embarrass Handel, who must be anxiously waiting in his grave."
1,voice too heavy for bel canto,"I love Renee Fleming. Renee Fleming has a beautiful voice. But it is too thick and heavy to sing bel canto. She is no Callas, or Sutherland, or even Caballe. I hate this cd. I think it is the worst thing that Fleming ever did. And that's sad because she's the best spinto soprano we've got these days. And I would hate to see her lose her voice by screeching out notes that are obviously way out of her range. I'll stay away from this one. Or you'll be wasting your money."
2,Apartment 12,"I was disappointed, this is by far not the best Mark Ruffalo has done. I do love him however, even if it was painful to sit through. He has come a long way from this film."
2,A Basket Case,"The main character is a painter/bum who will obviously break up with his girlfriend in the first act of the movie. He will then have to learn to take care of himself. He'll have to gain inspiration for his art and fall in love again. This is a straight-ahead no twists or turns free fall, and I'm talking in a very disappointing kind of way. Nothing worth noting in the film."
1,Magnetics concept poorly executed,The quality of this set is not good. Had the plastic pieces fit as well as say an ordinary lego set then perhaps the magnets would be able to hold pieces together right. Also at least a couple of the magnets had been put into the plastic housing upside down (so the polarity was reversed) and I had to pry them out and fix their direction. My son tried putting toghether this set but gave up even though he builds great models with Lego and with Knex connectrix sets.
5,Great quality,I've considered making my own play parachute until I've fóruns this one. Perfect. Great quality and very well made! I recomend this purchase. Fast delivery and worthy!
4,Not Quite 20 Feet,"Upon opening the parachute it looked smaller than I thought it would. I was expecting it to measure 20 feet across but I didn't take into account that it's really a cone and not a circle. It measures 18 feet 8 inches across. There are 16 handles, hopefully it will be big enough for our outside fun day at church.I'll have more of an idea about durability once we use it and hopefully will remember to update this review."
4,Well Done,"I used this parachute with my adapted physical education class and the kids loved it. They gave it a good workout pulling on the handles and everything held together well. Also, there colors are very bright, which is a big plus when learning colors. I have only used it three times bu so far so good. I wish the bags that hold the parachute was larger because it is a pain to stuff it in to the small bag supplied. It is the only reason I did not give this product five stars."
3,its ok.,Just a movational cd with a little music. Not all that.maybe a cd for beginners. but not adavance person.It did not help me. maybe for light walks.
1,Title is not what we received.,Clearly this says snare w/ tripod stand & splash. I ordered it for my sons hristmas present but it did not come with the stand or splash. Inside on the invoice it said comments : stand and splash not included.This is cleary mis-representation. The drum is in good shape butI clearly did not get what I was expecting to receive.
4,How the elements reflect work styles,"Life coach Laurie Beth Jones highlights the differences among individual work styles and categorizes them as elements: Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. She explains that if you pay attention to the natural ""elemental"" ways that people respond to work demands, you can create a more positive and, thus, more productive work environment. The reasoning (perhaps more than the metaphor) makes sense, and certainly beats always asking square pegs to work in round holes. Jones' approach is a little simplistic but that may help make it easy to use. She also brings in warm references to Jesus and Christianity. getAbstract suggests that this book could be a helpful starting place for understanding work styles and improving team dynamics."
4,Best book on the turn of the first Milennium I've seen!,"This is a very interesting book, not boring, not stuffy. It gives a good view of the turning of the first Milennium, from a few different angles. Easy to read, hard to put down. If you want to learn about that specific time period without feeling like you're doing boring homework then this is a good book for you!"
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy reading Beinart's column in the New Republic and I expected an excellent book. It was not very good, to be generous. The same old liberal bromides were in there- e.g. Muslims commit terror because of poverty. This is complete nonsense. Muslims commit crimes because of their religion. They will not stop hating us no matter how much money we spend on them.The bottom line is that Beinart has no real ideas on how to win the war on terror. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Too Deceiving,"What I mean by ""too deceiving"" is that in his arguments, the author never admits that he was totally wrong about the war. Beyond that point, the reader has to assume that his is factually untrustworthy. His writing style is similar to Andrew Sullivan's in that when he discovers he has made an enormous error in judgement, he backtracks and then tries to blame others. This is the hallmark of a coward."
2,WAAAAY TOO TECHNICAL,"Too much time spent on the mathematics of sound transfer and acoustics. Not enough on how to build the studio. Could not find a ""complete parts list"" for any of the plans. This is not for someone looking to build a simple studio. Very technical and boring."
3,too technical,"if you are on a financial budget, you are likely on a time budget, and this book can be a time sucker. it reminded my of my high school trigonometry book. I didn't spend much time with that, either. To the defense of the writer, my friends in the business who actually know what they are doing, swear by this guy and his books. I, however, am just trying to make a room in my house sound a little better, and could care less to know about the science behind it any more than I care about the science behind a combustion engine while I'm driving. I recommend 'basic home studio design' by paul white. simple, small, easy, the minimum that you need to know- but as much as i think 90% would need."
3,The new edition is Greatly Improved,"The new edition is called ""How to Build a Small Budget Recording Studio from Scratch ... , With 12 Tested Designs"" is much more accessible. Both editions cover the same area with the same info, so I don't know why they are continuing to publish this old edition in parallel with the new."
2,A poorly structured book,"The subject of the book looks promising, but the author might better have warned that the book is not conceived to be read from the beginning to the end, but directly jumping to the chapter that relates to the specific type of construction that you want to know more about. Otherwise, you find the same concepts explained again and again... and surprisingly, half way through the book it gets organized and the last chapters explain the basic concepts (again). In my opinion, a better structure would have reduced the lenght of the book to a half and provided a clearer understanding of the valuable information that it contains."
1,Whiny Rich Girl Cries A Lot,"This book is so slooooow. It's also predictable as it's written in an embarassingly elementary style. Chapter after chapter of very rich girl crying and blubbering. She is allegedly a rebel of her rich family and is distraught after inheriting the biggest fortune in England. For someone who hates money so much, she sure is cheap. At one point, she watches her friend, a single mother who works as a farm hand, count out her change to buy loose cigarettes. Anytime someone talks about their dreams or goals, she thinks ""Oh great they want me to buy them a...."" Whatever. Thought she hated the money anyway? This book is hard to stomach and totally unbelievable. The poor little rich girl is a whiny, cheap, selfish girl with no life experience. There is no mystery as anyone with half a brain can figure it out less than half way through the book. I hope the publisher didn't sign the author on for more than one book."
2,Wiser to pay more and get something better,"I don't normally use thigh-highs, got a pair of these in black color just because I wanted to check them out and these were super cheap. They arrived almost a week later than expected. The material could have been better - it ripped off at multiple places on wearing it the second time (I did order the correct size, its just the material was too flimsy)."
3,Thigh band is too snug,"I'm a medium-toned Af-Am woman. It's tough to find thigh highs that match my skin color. These match okay in the utopia color, but the sizing is a problem. I usually wear an AB size in stockings. The ABs fit in this brand--except the thigh band is too snug. It's uncomfortable, and I know from prior experience that this doesn't have to be the case with other brands. The CDs are a bit saggy on me, even though that's the size I have to wear to make the band fit. I'll keep purchasing them because the thigh highs I used to wear, in a different brand, were discontinued in my color. These will do for now. I'll keep looking for a more comfortable brand."
1,It is hard to find knee-high hosery.,"I was happy to find the knee-high hosery on line. I am familiar with the Berkshire name, and thought ""oh, good: good quality hosery!"" Wrong!! I was extremely disappointed with the ""fabric"" they are made of - how they sag on the leg. They don't look nice at all. They were delivered promptly."
2,Wouldn't be prudent,"The shipping on this item was very good, but the quality is terrible. Needs recharging almost everyday whereas the OEM battery could last for days. The use of the phone has not changed so that cannot be a factor."
1,Dead battery!,"I recently purchased this Nokia battery from Amazon. It was a dead battery so a local cell phone company replaced it with a battery that works. While this is the first Nokia battery purchased at Amazon, it's the second identical Nokia that's gone kaput within the first year of using. I cannot recommend this product."
5,Nokia Cell Phone Battery,"This product works great, it saved me on purchasing a new cell phone. The battery last a long time before I need to recharge. For only a few dollars it is a well worth buy if you want to save a little money verses buying a new cell phone. The company was prompt in delivering this product. Will do business with the supplier again in the future."
1,Apparently re-worked for the modern age,"Many of the ""symbolic"" references are completely at odds with what you might find in other dream dictionaries, which leads me to believe the authors came up with their own meanings for items based on the psychology and ""interpreted examples"" that are so heavily used in the beginning chapters.This book may be of interest to someone looking for science, but for a more comprehensive dictionary of the symbolism behind dreams, you will want to look elsewhere."
2,Book is good but software is lacking,"I've enjoyed the book very much. However, the software does not include many of the basic database features you should normally expect. For instance, the ability to search on keywords and phrases, there is no spellchecker, and the analysis feature mearly highlights the words that match with your symbols library which I don't consider to be analysis.For anyone interested in seriously journaling their dreams in software I'd look elsewhere on the Internet."
4,Dreams Working Interactive,"Explore, interpret, and record your dreams with this comprehensive dream dictionary and software journal database. Enter your dreams into the database journal and it will interpret the meanings and symbols. A truely innovative interactive tool."
1,urghhh,i read the description it sounded boring. bought it anyway and it was boring. plus it was 21 dollars. seriously wtf. DO NOT BUY
3,Plot not all that exciting,"I'm interested in the series as a whole, so I'll keep reading (the next book is better), but this book was pretty flat. His becoming a cat could have been very exciting...it wasn't"
4,A cool wild western style fantasy.,This is a great tale of wild adventures and cool characters. The story moves at just the right pace to keep you interested.
5,Funny and Timely,"Conlin really hits the spot in this timely analysis of what parenting is all about in our modern world. Funny and endlessly entertaining, any parent will get a big kick out of reading this sly take on what makes us all tick as we raise our kids. It doesn't matter where you are from, analyzing how American parents raise their kids (in contrast to the current craze for French parenting style), is a good read."
4,Subscription,This would have been a great purchase because of the cost. Just over a month now and I have yet to see an actual issue be delivered.
2,How the Mighty have fallen...,"This magazine is nowhere near as good as it once was. The quality took a drastic hit a couple of years ago and has gotten worse ever since. They are more concerned with selling ads and pleasing sponsors or benefactor companies than with bringing actual gaming information to consumbers. My favorite is when they change the mag format in a really bizarre, pointless manner, tell you how awesome it is, then change it back after the backlash and still write an article saying how great this change was. Don't bother with this, internet websites are leaps and bounds better."
2,Good Magazine but not enough Content,"I have been getting this magazine off and on for 10 years now and I recently let my subscription expire. The articles and reviews are very well done and are very humorous. The reason I stopped getting it was because it seemed like every other page was an advertisement and not content. Except for the main cover article you will have to read a page, flip a page just to finish a story. This magazine used to have quality and quantity but the quantity is strating to fall."
3,"Decent, but not great","After recieving a recent copy of PC Gamer as a gift, I read it and I enjoyed most of the articles. A lot of the reviews are short, especially for games they give very high reviews. For these games they should be able to write more than they do and create more feature articles. Kinda skinny on the Hardware reviews, but its a game magazine. If you're looking for that, I like maximum PC"
3,have not received it yet,"ordered this 4/08.2011 as of 4/10/2011 have not received yet,,i really enjoy this magazine ,was buyingover counter ,i was spending way to much ,hope it only takes 1 more month to get"
3,Mostly Adult Games,"I only have one issue so far, but it seems to be geared towards adult games. This makes it pretty much useless for my 14-year-old son that I bought it for. At least it was cheap."
2,Designed for younger people,PC gamer used to be good. But it seems like the games offered are forthe younger generation. The CD that comes with it is not what is expected. No offense against the magazine itself. But I am 70 so itdont appeal to me.
1,bad subscription service,"I ordered PC Gamer for my son. Site would not allow me to have it delivered to him. The first month's magazine came to me and I have not received another since that time. This has been about 3 months ago. No email or phone# to access for problem. Would not recommend purchasing on this site. Would appreciate some other way to contact responsible distribution.I have emailed Amazon.com once more to find a contact in order to resolve this lack of customer service (caring that the magazines did not get to me).So far, I've heard nothing. I will continue to request a contact for as long as it take s to corrct this wrong."
5,Sweet Magazine,"Get this magazine if you like the latest gaming news, and the latest game demos. Well worth the price I paid for this."
5,Hubby Loves it,"Hubby waits for it every month and reads it cover to cover, great fo anyone even a little interested in PC games."
5,Love it,I've been reading this for years and it is great. I really like the reviews and the hardware stuff.
1,DO NOT THIS CRAB!!,"This machine is full of problem, recorded TV show is never smooth... the remote control occasionally not work and you will need to reboot the system."
5,A Total Must Have CD!,"While my folks were away on vacation, I caught 'Risky Business' on HBO one evening. I was 13 at the time, but remembering that I had to see the credits, because I loved the music so much! I remember buying the German Import on vinyl.FYI, I would definitely suggest 'Wave Length' and 'Miracle Mile' too!At 32 my tastes are more discriminating, but I pretty much bought every TD album or CD that came out without listening to it, hoping to hear that hard charged fire from Risky Business.This is truly one of their best and a must have for any TD fan."
3,Swamp ( Not on the damn CD),To DCL from Kentucky. The song you are looking for is SWAMP by the Talking Heads
3,"Good Music, Questionable Quality",As the review title already explains - very good music but one track drags so the quality of the tape is questionable.
1,A waste of money!,"I got this stroller after my second child was born and it has been a nightmare! The front canopy broke off twice. the front wheels keep coming apart and getting wobbly. the foot rest flips back and locks up the stroller constantly. The carseat, when placed in the back, hits my 2 year old in the front seat in the head. the seats are too small. the cup holder is useless, the basket is way too small and impossible to get to. and finally, the back seat snapped in half where it connects to the frame of the stroller when my 8 month old leaned back in it. I do NOT recommend this stroller to anyone!!"
1,Do NOT buy this stroller!!!!,"I received this stroller as a gift and I absolutely despise it! It is TERRIBLE!! At the time I got it, I had a 15 mos. old and a newborn. The front seat does not recline and the seat is too shallow so the child looks like he's always sliding out. The wheels inhibit folding which is highly annoying when two small kids are screaming in the car waiting for you to load it up. The canopy in the rear is stationary so you can't move it to keep the sun out of your infant's eyes. The cup holder constantly falls off. The basket underneath is completely--and I mean COMPLETELY useless. It is totally inaccessible from the back of the stoller; the only way to reach it is at the infant's ""feet"". It is totally inconvenient and really useless. Lastly, the stroller would rather tip over before it wants to turn the corner.Stay away from this stoller at all costs. It is awful--not worth 1 cent!"
5,Confirms What You Suspected,"When I read this book, everything fell into place. Companies need workers, and they need customers. They could pay their workers enough to buy their goods, but they came up with something better (for them): credit, or the commitment to labor in the future to pay off the debt. Now they have workers (and customers) who are so deep in debt (or so eager to buy all the goods continuously marketed to them) that they have to work longer and longer hours. The history of employment and comparisons with the work hours of other countries were enlightening. When I saw how we are used, it changed my whole outlook. I read the book not long after it was originally published, and it's still one of my favorites."
4,Why haven't they written a new edition?,"I've had this book for years and just finished it today, 19 years after publication. Obviously, in our current economy her observations are a little jarring compared to 1993. However, most of the myths that she debunks are about history, so it's still true that way, like why there is so little leisure (because of capitalism) and what happens when hours are cut (productivity goes up, so employers save, everybody wins). All in all, summed up by my paraphrase of the penultimate sentence of the book - that we should redirect our pursuit of ""material goods toward redressing the inequalities of their distribution"". So much for keeping up with the Joneses."
4,As Expected,The book came in on time. It was in the condition as expect. I would recommend the buyer due totheir quality and prompt service.
2,Very Biased,"Schor gets her point across that people are spending too much time working, but her viewpoint seems to be very biased and difficult to harmonize with. For example, her definition of ""work"" is inflated to basically include everything that cannot be delineated as ""non-work"": including playing with children and helping them with homework, home improvement, etc. Reminds me too much of a politician!"
5,Excellent Book for beginning C#!,"This book is a must read for those who would like to take a class in C#, but don't have the time. I personally like Professor Smiley's style with all of the dialog and by including questions that all students may want to ask, but are afraid to while in a classroom setting. Also, I wrote the author about a program example, suggesting an improvement, and he responded with encouragement. The only drawback is his lack of including the full code to the final project, so that I may check to see if I missed anything or see any better ways of completing the grades project. I will certainly buy his book on VB.net and look forward to his book on intermediate C#."
1,Don't get if you're potty training a toddler,"What a nightmare! Imagine your toddler deciding to stick his toys in his little toilet, or wearing it as a hat! Yuck. The toddler in the story loves her potty as a hat,a toybox, a car, a chair,and a drum. Only on the last page is it used as a place to go to the bathroom ""and sometimes my potty is just a potty. I love my potty!""I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Anything can get published,Do not buy this book. You wouldn't want your poor child to get the misconception that he might put his potty on his head or store toys inside. She missed the mark on this one.
2,How Unsanitary,"""I Love My Potty"" by Lara Jones is a brightly colored board book that attempts to reconcile toddlers with the oft-scorned, much-feared potty. Jones attempts to familiarize tots with the concept of using a potty by having her main character interact with her potty in non-threatening ways, such as using it as a race car. However, Jones crosses over into the unsanitary when her potty-familiarization includes ""wearing the potty like a hat"" and carrying things in it. Overall, ""I Love My Potty"" makes a valiant attempt at helping a toddler learn to cheefully interact with a potty, however it is enough to make any parent squirm as their own children follow the example of the little girl in the story and begin to wear potties on their heads."
3,"Good start, terrible ending","I downloaded this book to my kindle because it was free and had a good review. The first part of the book was very good and I agree with the previous reviewer, that the best part was the author's descirptions of the music. I gave this book 3 stars because it was free. If I had spent money, it would have been much lower. The ending of the book is the worst- so bad that I felt like I had wasted my time reading the book."
4,Interesting read,really glad I opted to read this one. Thank you Amazon for making good books available for the Kindle at low prices
2,Sacred and Profane Love,"Such a good beginning, such a crappy end! In my opinion the writer got tired of writing this book and ended it....in a terrible way. If I had known it would abruptly end as it did....I would have skipped reading this one!!!"
1,Over dramatic,This book was overly dramatic and foolish. I felt bored reading it and was often annoyed at the way the author described the events.
4,"Ok product, just incorrect dimension","Product is fine but Height dimension given is incorrect. The chock is 5"" in Height, not 7"" as given. Recommended chock height should be 25% of the tire height, so too short for the vehicle intended."
1,item had expiration date for NOV2008 due to resin I think,Who on earth would think that a product made from RESIN has an expiration date. Well this one had one that makes the product useless later this year. This should have been disclosed in the advertisement and the fact it was not really upsets me. It was truely a waste of money. My recommendation is don't buy from this vendor; unless you like surprises or wasting money.
5,"Yep, it's a wedge.","I purchased this item because it looked like it'd totally work. It totally does. These are large enough to give you confidence that they'll keep your vehicle from rolling if they have to, and as far as I have been able to tell, they do just that. Huzzah for physics."
1,"Not Bad, but . . .","This product is well made, but it doesn't inspire confidence. The plastic is very hard and slick (low coefficient of friction) and does not grip to my asphalt drive very well. I'm not sure that it would prevent my trailer from sliding down the drive."
5,work great,I've only used these wheel chocks one time so far but they did the job wonderfully. They're heavy duty but still relatively light weight and are well-made.
4,Helpful Info,"This book does a good job at providing addtional info that you do not normally receive at the meetings. This book goes into great detail on exercise, why you should be fit, and how to achieve your goals. The menu plan is helpful, as we all know we can get in a rut when looking for a variety of foods to eat. I have found this book to be helpful when my will power was a little weak."
2,Testimonials from weight watchers regarding 10 diet myths,"The Weight Watchers Corporation is not going to give readers information just for the price of this book. ""Weight Loss That Lasts"" is written like an elaborate advertisement for the Weight Watcher classes. No specific facts are presented; chapter after chapter is a continual, repititious series of statements by satisfied Weight Watchers who were customer/participants. As I see it, this book is a bound and published brochure designed to bring more paying customers to the Weight Watchers classes in their areas."
2,Not enough flesh on the bone.,"If you're new to the Stones, and under 20, you might find this DVD interesting. For long-term Stones fans there is little that is new here beyond some early video clips of the Stones live. The DVD consists largely of interviews with rock journalists who know Keith, and these interviews hold up well. (Stones fans will be interested to see Tom Keylock interviewed as well.) The DVD also has many clips from Keith interviews (the MTV Kurt Loder interviews, for example), but the image quality is very poor, almost as if the producers of this DVD had lifted the images from Youtube.com. Finally, the instructions on how to play guitar like Keith contain nothing new for anyone who is not an absolute beginner. I'd say buy this DVD if you're 12 or have a 12-year-old who adores Keith. For everyone else, just visit the Stones articles on the Wikipedia site, view the same clips on Youtube.com....oh, and listen to Keith's and the Stones records, instead."
1,"A DVD where somebody ""discusses"" Keef? Gimme a break!","Although the Stones are, indeed, my favorite Rock and Roll...well, ""act"" of all time (the other 2 being Procol Harum & Fanny), they thankfully don't entertain a ""website"" where geriatric old ex-hippies waste internet space ""discussing"" themselves, like PH does. Like Keef himself once said, ""Rock and Roll is not meant to be analyzed from the neck up."" I mean, I can't believe that Keef would have no more control over his filmed output than to let some""one"" lash together some""thing"" like this...""discussion."" This is embarrassing, some old dweeb making an entire DVD, where he ""discusses"" Keef. Well, call the neighbors to the TV or something! Truth is, I'm just surprised that ""the great rock critic"" Cameron Crowe didn't have his childish hands in this. Again: just view the Criterion ""Gimme Shelter,"" view Keef at Muscle Shoals and at Altamont, and that is all that you would need to ""know."" ""Under Review,"" huh? Who the @#$% is this guy to ""review"" Keef?"
2,Not the best kind of documentary...just okay,"I only got it cause I'm a Keith fanatic. The interviews were sub-par. Nothing very insightful from other's perspective of Mr. Richards. Could have been better with interviews from people who Keith still gets along with, not old enemies or bitter celebrities."
3,"He's good, but he's not Marlowe.","I once read that many people prefer this version of Faust over Christopher Marlowe's. I can not really understand why. To be sure, there are powerful moments in this version. There are also dramatic passages and memorable moments. Perhaps I would have rated this better if I had not read Marlowe's version. The problem is that this lacks Marlowe's superb orginization, harsh realities, dramatic irony, and chilling terror. Don't get me wrong. This book is certainly worth looking at, but I suggest you read this version before you read Marlowe's."
4,Novel approaches to symbolic logical processing not up-to-dt,"Although containing example code in Common Lisp, the Common Lisp is of Steele's 1st edition variety, (NOT 2nd. edition). Logical symbolic processing employing manipulation of some truth maintenence systems and nets is informative."
3,"Interesting, but missing something","The writing is dry like reading an academic text, and yet it isn't as through and detailed and footnoted as most academic texts. As an academic text it's not trying to answer a very complicated question; it doesn't really do a compare and contrast between the courtesans or between the courtesans' lives and the legends surrounding them, instead its sole point is to give a brief overview of the lives of the 4 women it covers. (Perhaps if you are already familiar with the legends surrounding these women, you might perceive more dialogue between the true life and legend, but I had never heard of any of them before picking up the book so that aspect (if any) was lost on me.) As a popularization of history it also falls short -- I didn't feel like I got a real understanding of the character or personality of any of the 4 women portrayed."
5,The first woment to be liberated,"A facinating history of women from unremarkable origins that found a path to the top in an age thatsuited their talents (it wasn't all sex),"
4,very good,"This is a very good book to know the world of 19th century and the courtesans, it is very interesting."
3,The further adventures of Lydia...uhm...Piggy the Corgi,"Emily Carmichael's cleverest creation is Piggy, the wayward Corgi. The self-described 'stumpy-legged, sausage-shaped, big-eared, stupid-looking dog' is the earthly form of Lydia - the sexy homewrecker who was killed with her lover and is trying to earn her way to heaven through Piggy's good deeds. To be honest, Carmichael's human characters are rather ho-hum and predictable; the plot is also typical romance novel fare. But Piggy does have her comic moments.So if you're looking for a way to pass a quiet evening or boring flight, the adventures of Piggy might just serve. But barely."
2,Not the worst not the best,Its not a bad little guide but it's not exactly what I thought it would be. At the end of the day I guess it can provide some assistance
2,Organizing and Filing,"I bought this book about 6 years ago and brought it home to read. However, it deals a lot with filing away papers and tells you things like when you are finished with the dishes don't just let them sit there on the counter to dry, just towel them dry and put them away. But, it doesn't cover the fact that maybe that's not your problem. I needed more guidance on how to get my kids, husband and self to get into a routine to keep things tidy in a time efficient way. I tried using this book for about 2 months, but after that it was sold in a garage sale for 25 cents!"
5,A BLESSING FOR MY HOME,Thank you! I'm not alone and now I'm not such a Mess. These methods for Messie's such as myself really work for our personality type and help me to understand why I have been a Messie. I highly recommend this book for anyone who just can't seem to keep things organized and clean!
4,"Great for ""messies""!","If you have any problems with organization, this book is a must! It gives very insightful ideas on how to get your life back in order. I recommend the most recent version you can find!"
3,Not Kinky,"I checked this out of the library in hopes of seeing Kinky expanding his literary horizons. Unfortuneately, I have to agree with the reviewer who called it ""Kinky Lite."" I really wanted to like it, since his mysteries are so addicting, but I closed the book disappointed. I like the pranks and I like the characters, but there was just somethign missing. Don't read this if you're new to Kinky Friedman. Start with Roadkill or A Case of Lone Star. Three stars for my Kinky bias."
1,This isn't Kinky!,"I am a huge fan of Kinky Friedman's books, but was very disappointed with this one. It's the first book he's written that I actually didn't finish, it's just too introspective and frankly not Kinky's usual style. I expected to be entertained but was just bored. I hope Kinky's next book will be back to his normal craziness."
2,Advice to Kinky,"My advice to Kinky Friedman about trying to write a semi-serious novel...FORGET ABOUT IT!!Fans of Kinky or readers wanting to get acquainted would be better advised to try ""Spanking Watson"" if they haven't already read it. It may have little redeeming social value but tons of laughs."
4,Very Good,"I found this novel to be very good. I think that it takes a certain kind of perosn to be a fan. I will say that the constant pushing of Fox's mental illness did become an annoyance of the ""WE GET IT"" sort, but aside from that, I enjoyed the characters. The book didn't have a very direct plot, but not ALL novels do.This book helped me get out of a two year's writer's block with a simple lesson: You must live in order to create."
4,"Addicting, a great read","Walter Snow, Clyde Potts and Fox Harris are great characters. Kinky Friedman managed to create in Clyde one of the most enigmatic, strange and alluring characters I have read in a long time. This is a fast read and the plot is interesting, strange and just plain off the wall. These out of control characters are well presented by Friedman. Yet, Harris and Clyde will forever remain an enigma as we wonder whether what we know is truly real.This was first Friedman book and it was very entertaining. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys off the wall humor and strange occurrences."
2,"""Of all the novels in the world, she walked into mine...""","Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a Kinky Friedman fan. Or maybe I just haven't found the right novel of his to introduce me to his work at its best. This farrago of composition shoptalk, writers block blues, by the numbers poo-pooing of the corporate world, reality inversions, and way, way too few good one-liners is little more than ""Harold and Maude"" set in the big city.A couple of flim-flam artists resuscitate an author's dessicated humanity by the sheer force of their vitality. We know because he keeps telling us so every third paragraph. He tags along on several adventures, fretting over when it will all end, and then it does. Did I mention the dearth of good zingers? Friedman even reproduces a somewhat obscure Raymond Chandler line, unattributed. What would have been inspired is if Kinky Friedman the private detective had made a cameo appearance somewhere in this book. _That_ would have been a reality loop!..."
1,Waste of a tree,"If this had been the first Kinky book I had read there never would have been a second. I made it to chapter 24 before I realized that life is too short to waste on characters I despise and a book that had become a punishment to read. I enjoyed every other book by Kinky, so hopefully this was merely a speedbump."
3,Mixed Bag of Wacky & Weird,"Kinky is entertaining, but this book was turgid, and turned sort of dark and dismal. I guess I'm used to Kinky being irreverent and irrelavant; not trying to send us messages. I found it depressing in spite of Kinky's one-liners and goofy plot."
2,bring back the Kinkster,"I've read nearly all of Kinky Friedman's wry and irreverant crime fiction novels and enjoyed them very much. But this one stunk. As others have noted, this is a bit of a departure from Kinky's usual fare, where he's one of the characters in the shenanigans taking place. Instead, he introduces some new characters, none of whom are remotely charming or memorable. I also thought the plot was too weird, in a boring sort of way. I'd rate this at the bottom of the barrel of Kinky's novels. Perhaps some fans will find something to like here, but I found it dreadful."
1,Nonsense and non-science!!,"Or perhaps I should have said Nazi-science. Extremist Budiansky seems to have picked up where the likes of the Nazi-mentality left off. This absurd diatrbe should certainly not be listed amongst any legitimate science writings as it has nothing to do with real science, but rather, the author attempts to pass off his hateful agenda of others, as science; nonsense. Do yourself a favor---save your hard-earned money, you certainly won't be missing anything with this one....except precious time."
4,Ok - now for a review from a South African who grew up with zulu music!,"Only 4 stars bc. of the imperfect audio/video production. Nevertheless, an awesome dvd - esp. the live Paris concert. What is it about the French that make them so appreciative of all African music?!Johnny Clegg is a Zulu soul in an Englishman's body - plain and simple. This dvd captures the sincerity, modesty, compassion and inspirational energy of this icon of trans-apartheid fusion. When white folk were talking and complaining about the injustices of apartheid, Clegg was learning to speak Zulu, make music and dance the soul of the Zulu people. His music captures the triumph of joy over suffering that characterizes this people - the ability to see the spark of sunshine in the greyest of days.The bonus videos have been criticized for being amateurish. I personally think they are wonderful, but then I am a person who can't stand the over-produced slick MTV videos you see these days. The Nelson Mandela moment wil touch your soul."
3,just ok,"Compared to other tv dvds (such as Columbo) this one is not as good -- there are noticeable artifacts, The dvd was not cut from pristine original, but some later copy, and start of each dvd has introduction of the movie night series, e.g., McCloud, Columbo. Would rate lower, but the stories are pretty good especially in light of junk on tv nowadays."
4,Last of the good seasons,"What happened to the baby is left in the unknown but if that can be rationalized in one's mind, then it's a good season."
3,As a gift...,"I gave this as a gift to a known fan of the TV show. It's old by TV standards, but if you are someone with nostalgia for it, then it's a good buy."
4,This is DEFINITELY worth a listen!,"I am a sax player as well as a music teacher and have found this CD to be well worth the money! Not only do you get a wide variety of styles, but you also get to hear one of the rare saxophone orchestras who use uncommon instruments. You can tell that these players have a lot of fun together, which makes it all the more enjoyable to listen to as well as teach with. There are slight intonation problems on the occasion, but when you think about all of the things they are doing - I think I'll let that one slide! Don't miss out on this unique and enjoyable group! My personal favorite track is Casbah Shuffle. I hope you enjoy!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!,"What a major disappointment. Has this group ever heard of intonation, vibrato, or articulation? There are several spots on this CD where the ""ensemble"" is just not even close to being together. I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about. Don't buy this CD ""just to hear the contrabass sax."" I have heard better sounds from my lawn mower running over tree branches. The Nuclear Whales should pull this recording off the market to avoid any more embarrassment. I will not buy any more of their recordings, and urge you to do the same. Save your money for gas."
4,Wow,"I just saw Missy Higgins in concert on Friday night and New Buffalo opened for her. I had heard of New Buffalo, but never heard any songs... And I was just blown away! I really loved her! (she was so much better than the next opening act - Tim Rogers!! ick).I am going to buy all her cds now! :o)"
4,the sheriff of nottingham,"the sheriff of nottingham by richard kluger1208 England has sheriffs in the towns to keep peace. love era, the costumes, legends,things people stood up for, castles, taming of the big birdsNever realized how much religion and how much politics played a huge part of all this.I rate this a 4, because it was very long and took me forever to finish it. Really liked the era and all that entails, quite a tale."
3,NYKO TECHNOLOGIES 80650 Airflow Ex Pc Game Controller,"This is a good buy! I recommend this product because it has a really easy installation and because the quality is awesome! You can't find a better game controller then this! I was a little nervous at first because the package says it is compatible to windows xp and I have windows 7. Which is now one other reason I love it! Although start up software came with it, it installed automatically even without it!"
3,meh,"I haven't tried the thing yet. The buttons feel VERY flimsy. Very hard to find drivers for windows 7, although they are very customizable and easy to usethis is the only site that had them:[..]"
5,NYKO TECHNOLOGIES 80650 Airflow Ex Pc Game Controller,"This is by FAR! the best game controller that has ever been made. It's to bad that from what I have found and called Nyko, that they do NOT make them anymore. I would recommend this controller to anyone who wants a controller that can do it ALL! This controller can be mapped as a mouse, and can play ANY game ever made (emulators, FPS, etc...). This is my 2nd controller and my old one went through a ton of abuse and still lasted 3 years."
1,Absolutely no support.,"Does not work correctly for most games. Software is still at version .1- yes, point one. Web site is unhelpful and has not been updated in years. Waste of money if you are trying to play games which support a controller."
2,Not for Hard Core Gamers,I have bought 3 of these. The installation for Windows 7 is simple plug and play. None have lasted for more than a month or two. With several people using it for gaming the the buttons and d pad get stuck in the down position and eventually won't return to the correct position. It probably was used 3-5 hours per day. I am now going to purchase another controller that has a longer life span.
2,"Great, but cord broke.","Great controller. PS2 layout, the airflow gimmick works and is nice.Problem is the cord got frayed. Electricity melted the part where the cord starts out of the controller.Windows no longer recognizes controller."
4,A Good Computer Controller for a Good Price,"I was surprised to get a controller I enjoyed for a decent price. I have had this for over a year and have not experienced any trouble with it. The buttons are customizable, and some games will automatically set the game controller with the controls if it's installed and plugged in. With several extra buttons and 2 joysticks, I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of the keyboard and wants the game to feel real."
1,Didn't get to test it,"It doesn't work with Windows Vista. So, don't waste your time. I read many reviews about it before buying it but didn't get to the one that mentions this little yet important information. You'd think they would mention that with the product details !!! But, no."
3,Price doubled!!!,"Got one in Feb,2011 at around $12 including s&h.So; far so good,but the price goes up to $29 now,really not acceptable.Why not go to get a cordless one."
2,I can't figure out how to make it work,"Can someone tell me how to work this device? I bought the game recommended ""Grid"" and I cannot get it to work.Please someone help me?!?!?!"
1,Nice for the few months it lasted...,"First the fan broke on me--that's really annoying since that was a welcome feature, but I figured I could go on playing without it. And so I could until it stopped taking signals from my PC. If I unplugged and replugged it to the USB port, it would usually work again, but it wouldn't take it very long to fail, and while it was working it would gradually go on and off during the game. Is it so much to ask for a controller that *lasts*? Even if only for a year?"
2,Non Standard Button layout,"The quality of the controller seems fine, and the fans work.My problem is that the buttons are numbered differently than every other controller ever created! Instead of going 1-2-3-4 going counter-clockwise from the far left, the numbers are 3-1-2-4 (so only the 4 button is the same). This makes any game where they show you the button config visually really confusing to set up. NHL 09 for example, shows a picture of the controller, with the buttons numbered on screen, but they are in the standard 1-2-3-4 layout, so you have to ignore the picture and set up the buttons based on your 3-1-2-4 scheme.Another critical review mentioned that you can change this in the gamepad properties. Actually, you can't. You can re-map the buttons to keys on your keyboard, but you can't actually make the ""3"" button act like a ""1"" button.If i were buying again, i would look elsewhere just to save time in button configuration for every game i ever purchase."
3,"Rather gimmicky, poor crosspad.","The main draw of this controller is supposed to be its ventilation for cool hands. The problem is, this seems to be a necessity for using this specific controller. While using it without the fan active my hands get far sweatier than they do using the playstation controllers this product is obviously modeled after.The analog sticks are plenty responsive and the buttons are good (not too soft or too clicky), and the virtual keyboard emulation is top notch.However, my biggest gripe about this controller is the cross directional pad is completely worthless. The slightest transverse force on the crosspad results in a diagonal input. You could be pressing left at the very end of the pad without the up portion depressed at all and still be inputting up-left.Bottom line is this is a fine controller for 3d games, but if your intent is 2d gaming, look elsewhere."
1,Does not work on Windows XP,"I've tried this thing on 3 different computers with windows xp. The computers do not even detect the hardware. But the fan works. Its a great palm cooler.. The worst part is that this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer for the past 5 years and they no longer provide any support for it and will not even provide me with an old driver that I can try and use. I tried very hard to make this work. After several years of successful purchases at Amazon, this is my first return. I cannot understand why discontinued products with no support are being promoted by Amazon in collaboration with TotalConsole...I learned a good lesson. Anything that is not sold by Amazon is garbage."
3,"Decent for the price, nothing great","As other reviews stated, the d-pad sucks for 2D games. I bought this for emulators, and it's irritating to use with old NES games. It constantly turns a left or a right into a diagonal input if you aren't exactly precise. Not bad for other games such as PS, etc. My only other problem with it is that the buttons are a little too clicky for me... definitely doesn't have that nice feel that console system controllers do. I also run this on a Mac, and the provided software is wonky. Crashes constantly and it's a pain to set up buttons. For the price, though, this is not bad."
1,Arrived broken,Just opened this up and the right analog stick is broken. It sticks in whatever direction it's moved and it isn't mounted right internally. It's more of a button than an analog stick. The directional pad is also very tough... I plan on throwing this in the trash and ordering a new one from Logitech within the next few days.
5,Very enjoyable book,I read it finally and think it is the best book from these series. Very well written. I liked the style and deepness of characters.
5,One of Balogh's best,"This book, which is the 6th and last of the Slightly series, is my favorite. It has delightful touches of humor and comes close to slapstick in certain scenes. The hero, Wulfric, is a duke of icy demeanor and rigidly correct behavior. He has no tolerance for fools and distances himself from almost everyone, including his many headstrong siblings. But behind the barricades he has erected lies a man yearning to be loved and understood, wanting to reach out but not knowing how. Enter our heroine, an impoverished widow who, despite a tragedy in her past, has a warm, outgoing nature that makes her a universal favorite. She embraces life, and once Wulfric is drawn in to her orbit - or she is drawn into his - there is no escape for either of them. This hero and heroine are a perfect match and this is a perfect read for a sunny summer day."
2,The heroine is just too silly to believe,"The antics that the heroine gets into really makes her look and appear headstrong, foolish, and downright silly and the results are predictable, especially with the falling into the water to retrive a stranger's glove. Give me a break. What makes her hard to visualize is that then she has moments of great insight and wisdom beyond her years. I did not find this character believable at all. Don't waste your money. Check it out of the library if you must read it."
3,Predictable,This is the second book by Mary Balogh that I've read and I was really disappointed. The first was The Proposal which seemed original and had well drawn characters. In this one the characters are again distinct but the story line is so predictable. Some of the dialogue is almost exactly the same as the other book! And I found the heroine to be a little over the top for the time period. Georgette Heyer is the queen of this time period and even though there is some predictability in her novels as well it was not so blatant as this.Don't think I'll read anymore of Balogh's books.
3,"an okay book,,, i usually prefer stronger women","Idk, I don't really want to say anything truly bad. I guess it just did not satisfy my taste. but I guess someone else would find it very enjoyable."
2,Disappointing - a mere shadow of what it could have been.,"I have been a Mary Balogh fan for years and I was so looking forward to this book that it was a shock when it turned out to be such a let-down. Ms. Balogh writes so well that even a poor book of hers is better than most historicals but I cannot remember ever being so diappointed in one of her books before. It was very hard to get into, the middle dragged on and on, and the ending was abrupt. I did not see the development of a loving relationship between the 2 leads, the sex was boring, and there were all the characters from previous books popping up throughout the story, it was hard to keep them all straight. The explanation behind the heroine's 'disgrace' seemed so lame to me, I wondered how anyone could have been stupid enough to fall for it. Ms. Balogh can do better and I hope she redeems herself in her next offering."
1,Deludente!,"Il libro più deludente della bravissima Mary Balogh, non mi è piaciuto nulla eppure avevo tante attese.La protagonista femminile mi ha irritato dall'inizio alla fine e non ho affatto compreso come un personaggio affascinante come il duca si sia potuto innamorare di una sciocca del genere.Mi spiace, è forse la prima volta che la Balogh mi delude e che non riesca ad apprezzare nulla di una sua opera. Un libro altamente sopravvalutato a scapito di narrazioni davvero più efficaci come devil's web e a gift of daisies che invece hanno valutazioni davvero troppo basse."
4,loved it,"It was my first book from Mary Balogh but definitely not the last one. The hero and heroine reminded me a bit of Pride and Prejudice and I really loved the interaction between them and the plot. The book made me laugh and cry. And what a great family the Bedwyns are - now I want to read all of their stories. Definitely a keeper. Mary Balogh knows how to create characters who come alive. The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars (but 4,5 instead) is that at some point, Christine's carefree behaviour became a weee bit over the top. But it did not spoil the book for me."
5,ljanicet,"This is one of my favorites. Mary creates a ""Pride and Prejudice"" type romance that is simply wonderful. That funny, lovable and a little willful Christine would win the heart of the austere Duke of Bewcastle is what makes this so fun to read. She is always herself, and he is slightly horrified by the crazy situations she gets herself into, yet he cannot resist her. It is definitely one of my keepers."
5,Can't Get Enough...,I love this book so much. Out of all of the Slightly series this one is my all time favorite. I love Wulfric his charater is so hott. And Christine is a wonderful person with a big heart. This book kept me laughing and was just unbelieveably great. My words can't justify it. I love all of Wulfrics siblings but out of all of them I like him best. I don't have this book yet but I hope to get it soon. I would most definately recommend the Slightly series to anyone - but Wulfric is still the best.
2,A Let Down...,I expected so much more from Wulf's story. Christine (his love interest) was immature and unintersting. I have LOVED every other book in this series and thought Wulf deserved a better tale. Perhaps the author wrote this novel on a tight deadline. It was painful to finish and weak.
3,Slightly Disappointed Also,"I was so anxious to read Wulfric's story - author Balogh has been leading up to it in all her ""Slightly"" books, and I am sorry to say that it disappointed me.I couldn't warm up to Christine at all. She was too childish for Wulfric. Granted, he needed someone to help warm up his rather chilly personality but she was simply too much. She would swear that she hated him one minute and be laughing with him the next. She just plain irritated me. I think the author could have given the Duke a better partner than Mrs. Derrick. I loved all the couples in the previous books. I tried to like Christine and couldn't manage it. I gave this book 3 stars because of the Bedwyn's alone. It was good to be able to catch up with them all again and see how their families had grown. If you like the Bedwyns, this book is worth a read. Just don't expect much from the heroine."
1,Quizzing Glass???,"I am sorry but I could not get past the quizzing glass!!!! It annoyed me to no end. I found the hero cold, boring, and ridiculous to boot....how the heroine fell in love with him was unbelievable. Wulfric was to staid and he was not a good match for our heroine. Christine was fun, vivacious, and loving. The chemistry was not there if felt as if MB was forcing a connection just to end the series. The sex scenes was lack luster at best. My gosh I had to grit my teeth to finish this book.I bought this book after reading the reviews, but now I am sorry I did. I want so badly to return it to the book store and claim buyers remorse! I did not enjoy this book not one bit!The quizzing glass made him sound so silly...UGH!!!"
4,This book kept the heart of the family going,"I've only read two in the series, the book with Raef was my first book. In that book I really liked the Duke and very much wanted to read his story. Luckily I was able to find it and didn't have to wait. If I had I may have forgotten about it.This was OK. I enjoyed the follow up with the whole family. I liked that the Duke was so solem, and you knew there was a sense of humor and heart lurking. I would have liked for it to come out a bit bolder. However, the writer maintained the character and you come to except that though there is a lot of depth only some people get to see it all and even you as the reader, though you know it's there, are not going to see what the heroine gets to see in private.The heroine was good. She was a nice opposite to the Duke. And she was a great clutz. You could definitely see that she and he complimented each other and would have balance."
5,One of the best romances I have read,"I seldom give something five stars, but I thought this book was superbly done. I was a bit hesitant going in, because some of the reviews said ""not as much plot as her earlier books."" What I discovered upon reading it was that they meant ""not as many plot devices."" There are no forced marriages, fake engagements, artificial reasons to live with someone.There is,instead, a very good beautiful story about two people who fall in love during the course of their natural and realistic interactions, even though they have very good and realistic reasons to avoid each other.A beautiful story, beautifully written!"
2,Slightly Dangerous is vastly disappointing,"I'm sure all readers out there will not agree with me, but I was very disappointed with Wulfric""s story. I was looking for a love story with a strong and cold man, who would meet someone with a warm and loving personality. Instead Ms Balogh gave a strong hero and a ninny for a herione. This ruined the whole story for me. I thought Wulfric deserved better. There was too much ""Pride and Prejudice"". I loved meeting all the Bedwyn's again, but even that was too much. Where was Wulfric's present love story, all I saw was his boyhood life. Maybe if Christine were of a more mature nature and not like some adolescence a Lady of his world and not a ninny with more romantic love scenes I would of loved it.I feel Ms. Balogh let Wulfric and me down. Too bad."
3,Average story,"If you want a fast romance and full of sex scenes, then this isn't the book for you. This is more a man and woman who meet and slowly gets to know each other and fall in love at the same time. There are two sex scenes, but pretty mild.Spoilers: the villain of course is the one who everyone believes to be a good loyal friend who loves Christine, but Justin uses manipulation of words to ruin Christine's reputation"
2,Slightly Tepid,"This was not the ending to the Bedwyn saga that I expected and I was disappointed. There was such a build up to the Duke that I expected more than this drawing room, country house party story. The ""dangerous"" duke engages in nothing more sinister than a leisurely stroll around Lindsey Park as he woos the elusive widow, Mrs. Derrick -- who is not at all certain she likes the Duke well enough to endure his company let alone become his Duchess. As a long time fan of Ms. Balogh's, I know she is capable of heart-wrenching emotions but there are none in this story and the attraction-- the Grand Passion-- between the two seemed contrived. Still, this calm, cerebral tale should appeal to fans of Jane Austen. For myself, I wanted more action and suspense."
1,More than slightly disappointed,"I have been waiting since I read ""Slightly Wicked"" to read Wulfric's story. I was drawn, as many readers were, to his enigmatic character. I eagerly read every new addition to the series in one sitting. When reading the ""teaser"" in the back of Slightly Sinful I was unsure of the character Mary Balogh selected to thaw out the icy Duke. My reservations were well-founded because this is by far the weakest story of the series. After two weeks with this book, I can not even bring myself to finish the final few chapters. I am bored with the characters and the lack of erotic tension. I will simply have to make up an alternative story in my own imagination to bring satisfactory closure to what was otherwise a great series."
2,Boring!,"I hate to admit that I am writing a review on a book that I had to skip through. I would ""skip"" anyone's review that didn't read the whole book. I tried several times to start this book & finally ran out of other reading material and forced myself to finish it so I can return it to the library. I really never connected with Wulfric even when he was in the other books. I didn't care for Christene all that much & really don't think in real life these two would be attracted to each other. How annoying the quizzing glass was! I enjoyed the other books in this series but this one was a chore that I just couldn't get through."
2,Helpful but unrealistic,"As a financial advisor who built his book partially from cold-calling, it was refreshing to see that somebody else understands that it is a powerful business builder. However, a lot of what I read appeared to be unrealistic. For example, the author claims to coldcall everyday, yet, has been in the business for 20 plus years and limits his practice to 50 households."
3,"Good, but spendy. Rubs on wall.","This is a well made product, and it should be for a C Note.When I bought it, Amazon was the only place that had them.Now, Target has the same unit but with a black plastic top, and sells them for $69. If Target would have had that model when I ordered this one, I would have gotten it.One little niggle: The hinge juts out on the back of the basket and rubs on the wall or cabinet it is up against. I had to put a piece of 2X6 behind the basket to keep it from rubbing the finish off the wall. When it rubs, it also interferes with the opening of the lid. Tried just moving it away 6 inches, but even with the rubber feet, the unit slides back a little every time you use the pedal, and before you know it, it is rubbing on the wall again."
4,Really Like This Flatware!,This flatware is perfect for everday use. It has the perfect weight to it and enought pieces for me and my family.
4,An intriguing story about socialist Hungary,"""An American Woman"" tells the story of Anna Bator, a Hungarian-born woman who emigrated to America at a young age with her parents after they were arrested as spies. Now a grown woman with a successful career as a television journalist, Anna returns to Hungary to search for answers about her past.This book is a very engaging story about the Cold War, and Kati Marton does a good job of illustrating the differences between American mentalities and the brutal politics and hostilities of Eastern Europe. I enjoyed the three different love stories depicted in the book: Anna's relationship with her lover, her parents, and her heritage. There's a major twist at the end of the book which was not at all what I anticipated, but I really enjoyed it.""An American Woman"" is written in a very straightforward style, but the story is intelligent and rich in historical detail. It's a shame this is Marton's only novel."
5,It's just like SNES but mini.,"I personally like the SNES and it's library, but never had the chance to actually own one. This isn't the original snes, but personally it's the same thing. It's also smaller and easier for travel. All in all, a quality Nintendo product. The only thing you have to watch out for is who you get it from."
5,Very informative,"This is a very informative book about the history of Jewish anti-zionism in the USA. Highly recommended for open minded individuals. It details the American Council for Judaism, an American anti-zionist group that operated in the 40s."
1,worst season!,This was a horrible season! I own all the other seasons of this show. I've loved it from the beginning. I'm sorry to say I will not be getting this season though. It would just be a waste of time to re watch it and money to buy it. I'm hoping season 8 will be better since Sera Gamble was fired! Honestly once Kripke left the show it was over.
4,Nice turn for Jensen Ackles,"I feel as though some reviewers on this page missed some under tones in this ep.Dean is obviously worried about Sam. And I think some of what he does has to do with protecting his little brother. Saving him from having to kill a friend.Also, you must consider his own pain at losing Lisa and Ben. Honestly, when I saw the kid I thought Dean was going to kill him too. But instead he tells him to stay on the non-homicidal straight and narrow. Proving that while he may be troubled, Dean is forever the self-sacrificing protector."
3,So So,"Season 7 is a mix. Some of the episodes have been great. But the show is losing direction. It seems like it is winding down. The of the most important characters -- Bobby and Cass -- have been missing from the last few episodes. Also, some of the production elements that made the show unique -- the rock and roll track, Dean's car and the dark filming -- have been dropped. Now the show is filmed in bright colors, and Dean is driving a baby blue car. This has changed the entire texture of the show. The show also seems empty without Bobby. I'm not sure why they keep bringing back Crawley. If anything, Cass should return."
5,Love the series!,Great Product! Season Seven wasn't the great season for Supernatural but contains some great one off episodes! Would recommend for any Supernatural fan to complete their collection!
5,Got to love supernatural,Doesn't matter what season I love this show could go on for 10 more seasons and I would love it still.
5,As good as the Previous six seasons,"I am a sci-fi fan and after the loss of the X-Files, Firefly, and Battlestar I am thrilled that this show has staying power... I love the mythology surrounding the family and the play on history and mythology keeps the stories interesting. Season seven is great and cant wait to watch season eight..."
3,"Love the show overall, this season not so much",I watched this episode for free thanks to my Prime Membership to try to remember something that happened in it. I'm a long-time fan of the show though I think the first 5 seasons were definitely better.
4,Love the boys,was missing an episode so I downloaded to fill in the blank. It was good - the seventh season is not my favorite and I'm missing Jim Beaver :P
5,love it !!!!,I am so in love with this show.got into it mid 2012 and didnt take me long to get caught up and wanting more.. gotta love SPN !
5,Finally this season a really great episode,"This season has been some good and some bad but not much great. This episode, the real return of Bobby I would rate unamong the great. I thought that they didn't do justice to Castiel's return and I wasn hoping that they would do better by Bobby and they did. I also liked Annie as a character and I wish we had seen more of her earlier in the series. I was a little puzzled by Dean's final reaction; so I hope they flush character development out some in future episodes. I also hope that Bobby stays around long enough to get revenge on Dick Roman for that shot to the head. I really want Castiel and Lucifer back too but I doubt that they will bring back both of them. I could care less about this new Meg. Here's looking forward to season eight of Supernatural my favorite show."
4,Sammy and Dean? What's NOT to love?,"Another great episode has come to pass.We follow Sammy, Dean, and their monster killing entourage through another 45 minutes of supernatural adventures.There has been maybe 1 episode I was not head over heels over.I am saddened because it obvious the show is slowly preparing to end.It may be another season or two. As long as they dont kill off a main character!Oops..Bobbie and Cass who?"
2,"Bad, bad episode","We finally get to see Bobby again and he's neutered down to saying his catch phrase. ""Balls! Balls! Balls!"" It made no sense either. He spends the whole episode bitching about going through things, not being able to move anything, and at the end, suddenly he looses the ability to go through things and we spend ridiculously tense minutes while he searches the room to find the switch. I'm glad he learned how to move things but really! This could've been an awesome way emphasize being a ghost but they lost that. I was watching it, thinking, go through the freakin' wall, you idiot. That's all you've been doing all episode."
5,Bad Time For Sam!,"Received quickly and is an excellent season! They could have explored Sam's problem more but, it was still a fantastic job!!"
5,Best show on television?,"Supernatural is one of the best shows on television. Period. Writing, acting, editing. All top cabin. Special effects are also very good. The local's used in the show are perfect. Season seven is again excellent. I remember the first season , watching occasionally while my wife watched this show. I remember telling her that it was a typical CW pretty boy show. But it started to draw me in. And I am very glad it did. Seven seasons later I'm a invested fan of the show. Try out watching it..you will not be disappointed!"
3,Supernatural,"I am a huge fan of Supernatural. Season 7 though was a bit of a disappointment. If you like Supernatural I would definately reccomend seeing it. I myself just did not like the story line, while others love it. Reviewing this season is just personal preferance."
3,Not bad,"Though I love being able to see the whole season. I purchased a cable so I can connect my Ipad to the t.v. and watch the episodes that way. However, the amazon app does not allow that. Bummer."
3,Getting little tired of angels and demons,"I have loved this show since it's first season and still watch it because I love the dynamic between Padalecki and Ackles as the Winchester brothers. With that said this is not a favorite season. If you love the show and need your fix of the WInchesters then yes this is a season you will want. However, the writers need to include more ghosts and Wendigos and shapeshifters in their seasons. I am getting a little tired of the angels and demons crap. Plus they need to find a way to bring back Bobby. They did with Castiel."
5,Supernatural season 7 DVD,Package came in perfect this time. No damage to the discs or the paperback cover. I've made all my DVD purchases at Amazon & I never have a problem with the disc. Except with the plastic DVD covers tend to ship to me damaged but the discs were perfect condition.
5,supernatural,SUPERNATURAL IS THE ULTIMATE. keep rockin I own all seasons waiting on 7 to be released but i do watch cw
2,JUST Barely Ok!,"See my other reviews on series 7 and you will get the picture about this series. It won't last long at this rate. No smooth transitions from one episode to another and jumps all over the place from one episode to the other. Simply stated the writers no longer have any continuity and seem to have run out of ideas. To much ""What's wrong with you, and what'wrong with me"" Keep the two Brothers, Bobby and CASIEL involved and the brothers working more together and not in conflict with each other. You have worn this idea out!"
2,Series 7 not flowing smoothly from one episode to another,"Not very interesting and does not flow smoothly from one episode to the other. Bring back Casiel, he kept the episodes more interesting to watch. The writers of these latest episodes are jumping all over the place. This ongoing series will not last much longer if number seven proceeds any further in this fashion."
3,Still enjoy but not the same,"I actually haven't seen this season yet but want to. I have loved the show from the very first episode that aired. I didn't enjoy season 6 as much and didn't like the finale. But I love the characters too much to stop watching. I agree and believed even back when the fifth season was airing that it should have been the last. The show should have ended when Kripke left. I really wish he would've stayed on but it should have ended then. As awesome as the the story line increases in drama and epicness, In all honesty I miss the first and second season style alot, more about random monsters and creatures ( a simpler time in the whole story). Though its probably impossible to go back to those times, It would be nice and If they could end the whole show on a happy note with everyone alive that would be fantanstic! But I know that won't happen."
2,Never going to watch it,"I owned Season 1 thru 6 of Supernatural. The only reason I bought this was because it was on sale for $10 and I could pay for it with the cashback I had earned through discover. Even for free though, this is still the worst season of the entire Supernatural collection.Where as Season 6 had many plot lines that were dropped or quickly written out, Season 7 only had one, the Leviathans, and it became old fast. And while killing Bobby may have helped raise the rating during sweeps week, it has negatively effected the show since.But I'm still going to give it two stars instead of one, because the dicks jokes were fabulous. Gotta love Dick."
5,One of my favorite shows,"Supernatural is one of my favorite shows - and now my husband's as well. The writing is superb, with witty dialogue, great action sequences, multiple subplots that all interconnect in the big picture, and memorable characters. A modern-day western style action-drama with demons and creepy crawlies. A must watch for anyone who likes movies with monsters and new takes on good and evil."
3,Season 7 Good but not up to the usual standards,"I love supernatural. However, season 7 seemed to drag. The first few episodes that set up the plot line did not have the action and protaganism that is usually expected. i was disappointed with the end of the season. It was fairly obvious that they were going to kill Bobby off. I am hoping that season 8 has more action and strife than was involved in season 7."
5,Supernatural Season 7,Another great season traveling across the US fighting the forces of evil with the Winchester boys! A must buy for fans of Scifi and Horror!
5,AWESOME,I am a HUGE fan of supernatural. This season was in my opinion a lot better then the season previous. It goes back to hunting the monsters like they used to in the beginning. This said the last episode was a disappointment to me! Very predictable! I'm curious to see what they will do with the eighth season.
2,Seriously?,"And how many times must we deal with poor Sammy walking off away from his brother. For goodness sake, we've been here before - repeatedly. At least let the boys learn from their damned mistakes once in a while. I've loved this show, but I'm frankly getting pretty damned sick of recycling."
3,No pie this time around...,"The brothers barely make it out of their last run in with a Leviathan when Sam catches wind of a creature he dealt with in his childhood and leaves his brother behind to investigate. Seeing a younger Sam in his awkward years was a treat, but the pacing of this episode felt a little slow. I'm not real happy with what Dean did at the end either, as it felt a little... off, like he wouldn't have done this before the Apocalypse. It's possible that with everything that's happened at this point, he doesn't want to take any more chances. A decent episode and a nice peek into the early years of hunting, but not one of the best."
3,I'll only review this one this time,"My son purchased earlier seasons of Supernatural for me and I have been following the reruns because I cannot get The CW network with my cable service. I have been hooked on Supernatural for quite a while, but have been dissapointed with recent episodes. They should have not taken Casiel out of the series. He made the earlier episodes much more interesting. The newer characters seem to come and go to fast except for Bobby. I don't like paying for each new episode and am getting more dissapointed with this series, but thats the writers fault. Kill off the Leviathons and get Casiel back!"
5,"After seeing the pilot, you're not gonna wanna stop!!","Still trying too figure out why I haven't started watching this show from the beginning! It's really great!! I love all the characters, and I love how the concept of the show can keep the series going for a very long time. If and when it does come to an end, I'd be quite sad cause its been one helluva ride!!! I am also very geared up for season 8!! Whoo hoo!!"
5,Yet another amazing season of Supernatural,Season Seven of Supernatural was yet another one for the history books! Sam and Dean never seem to catch a break! Can't wait for season eight!
5,CREEPY!,"The writer of this episode has outdone himself in the creepy department! Ben Edlund, there has to be something wrong with you (but in a good way actualy, I'm just kidding, I think)! The little girl that gets taken over is the most exquisitely horrible blend of sweet little girl and CREEPY villian imagineable! The new bad guys, the leviathins, are powerfully scary. Sam's hallucinations and Dean being able to help him with his experience provides an emotionally powerful punch to the episode. In my opinion, a great episode!"
1,and I thought the 6th season was bad...,"First let me say, I absolutely love Supernatural. One of my favorite TV shows out there. However, the 6th and 7th season are TERRIBLE! My wife and I keep trying to watch it when it comes on TV, but we end up turning it off everytime because it's literally like the writer/producer are sitting around naming off every cheesy thing that could possibly happen and going ""Yeah, that would be hilarious! It's so dumb!"" and then they put it in the show. It's ridiculous.You lose your favorite characters, Bobby and Cas, and they replace it with a bucket load of bad animation and a ridiculous story. Every once and a while Sam and Dean's ability to click with each other comes through (which made the show in the first place) and gives you a smile, but other than that it's not even worth watching.Show should have ended when the original writer left at Season 5."
5,Great present for friend,Bought this for a friend and she just couldn't stop watching it. Took a whole weekend but she finished it.
5,love it,This was a great season. It did a great job of starting a new story arch. Recomend it for any action/sci fi lover.
5,love those Winchester boys!,The boys are back to fighting big baddies. Love the campy humor. Love the characters and their relationships while they battle for good.
3,Sam falls under Becky's spell,"I don't know about you, but I can only take Becky in small doses if at all. To base an entire episode on her warped feelings for Sam seems a waste. Sam under the influence of a love potion and marrying Becky - seriously? Ugh! I did love the twist at the end with the yuppie demon getting his comeuppance from Crowley (Mark Shepard) and Crowley's big reveal at the end. I hope we have seen the last of Becky. This episode tried my patience."
3,Wished for more,"I have been a fan of Supernatural since the beginning but Season Eight had a lot of hits and misses. The leviathan storyline was fine, but the quick conclusion was completely insane! After spending episode after episode of attempting to find them, kill them or get anywhere near them it takes Sam and Dean minutes to get into a fortress like building and dispatch Dick. Nothing inventive, nothing exciting, just a little misdirection and he's dead. The saving grace was the ending. I like the idea of exploring purgatory a bit more and really hope that they run with it."
5,Another Great Season,"While others have shared their disappointment with season 7, I have yet again been left begging for more episodes of Supernatural! While the Leviathon theme was not my favorite to come from the show, the storyline continued to build more depth particularly when it came to the relationship between Sam and Dean."
4,In-Universe Terminology,"The episode is great, but the synopsis is misleading. Amy is definitely not a demon. There were no demons in this episode. If you can't spell whatever she is called, just say 'monster'.I started watching the show at Season 7 with what was available on Hulu, and liked it so much that I went back and bought seasons 1-6 here. Now that I'm caught up to Season 7, I'm trying to figure out what episodes I've already seen. The misuse of the term demon threw me off, and thus I paid $2 for an episode I've already watched."
5,Supersupernatural,"This series continues to deliver. I have cried, been frightened, and laughed out load. I am hooked on Sam and Dean. I eagerly await another season of my boys. There are many new shows that are attempting to deliver supernatural thrills but this one has fans for a reason. The J's have given depth to their characters that doesn't come off hokey. It shows talent when they have us scared and believing in mud monster leviathans who are trying to rule the world. It doesn't matter what critter they are fighting they always do it with style. Always a supernatural treat:)"
5,Supernatural season 7,"Gift for my girl, she got so caught up that it only took the weekend to watch the whole season. Got to love Sam & Dean!"
5,Love Supernatural!,Great product! I love this series! Supernatural is my favorite tv series. if you've never seen it watch one episode and you'll be hooked...then come to Amazon and start at the beginning by purchasing Season 1. Amazon did a great job of shipping it when they said they would.
2,BEST IVE EVER SEEN!!!!!,I LOVE SUPERNATURAL AND WAS SOOO EXCITED TO GET THE SEVENTH SEASON BECAUSE I DID NOT CATCH IT ALL WHEN IT WAS ON TV. I WAS DEFINATELY NOT DISSAPOINTED!!!!
5,"Great singing, great jazz.","This is a great album from Inga Swearingen ably supported by Trio 14.She sings a wonderful selection of songs, the outstanding tracks being 'The nearness of you' and 'All blues'. Superb jazz on an album that should become a collectors item. Buy it while you can."
2,"Disappointing, compared to PHC performances","I bought both of Inga's first two albums, based on her terrific vocal talents and marvellously beautiful voice, which I'd heard several times on Prairie Home Companion. But the song selections and arrangements in both albums disappointed me, and put them into the deep storage/giveaway box. I didn't even think there was a single song, on either album, to be worth the tome and effort to add them to a ""gentle female jazz vocals"" playlist on my iPod. I really hope she does better, in her future albums, because her voice is terrific."
5,love the book,My sone loves this book and the series that goes with it. Allot of fun to read I would recomend it for any age 1-8.
2,Not her best album,The songs were slow and tedious. I would recommend not purchasing this album. It is not up to her usual quality.
1,Truely Insane,"The author of this book has no understanding of basic economic theory. If he did, he would understand that the scenario he paints is nearly impossible to pull off. If he does understand the basics of macroeconomics, then he is simply a fearmonger and a liar.0 Stars."
3,bag,This is the second one of these bags I have purchased. On the first bag ALL the zippers broke within the first six months I had the bag.
2,Why did Merrell sell out ...,"I discovered Merrell many years ago --back when it was its own company. The shoes then had spring in the soles and a very different last. The arch was a perfect fit for my foot. Well then they sold out to Wolverine. The foot bed is completely dead, the rubber construction is sloppy. There is glue on the seams, the arch is non-existent. Its a shame that someone in a large corporation is making decisions to shave a few bucks off construction leaving the consumer with a mere shadow of the former product. The other shoes in the Merrell line have become almost cheap Chinese knock offs. Pitiful and pathetic, I am forced to abandon Merrell completely."
4,Comfortable on long hikes,"Just got back from doing lots of hiking out west, including a 4 day backpack trip in the Tetons. I tried to wear these shoes around town before I left, just to get a bit more comfortable in them. It wasn't really necessary. As with most Merrells I've had, they seem to be comfortable right out of the box. I have wide feet and these fit great and true to size. I found these very adjustable so I could lace and tighten just how I liked. Held up well. Fully waterproof. A very good boot."
3,Helpful,"Author is very knowledgeable. Explains the psychology behind self-defense and rape prevention, a good thing for women to be aware of. Note to author/editor: The spelling is ""lose"" not ""loose"". This error occurs throughout the book and is distracting. While spelling has nothing to do with self-defense, errors make people seem less credible. Also, the author states that rape is not the victim's fault--true. But then goes on to say that it wouldn't happen if a potential victim responds properly, i.e. with techniques learned in the book. This gives mixed messages."
2,"doesn't pinch, but also does NOT curl","This eyelash curler delivers half of what it promises: that it won't pinch. However, it just does NOT curl, even after I heated it up with my hairdryer, and held it in place for about 15 seconds - it did absolutely nothing for my lashes. Costing more than my old shu uemera, I expected it to perform at least as good, if not better, for the main purpose of being an eyelash CURLer. I'll be going back to my uemera curler, and i'll just be more careful to not pinch myself - at least it works. This was a complete waste of money as a beauty tool."
2,uncomfortable to use,"It is difficult to see your eyelashes through the hardware and place this curler in the right place. If you're looking for the perfect eyelash curler, keep looking. It's not better than the $4 ones at the drugstore. The tweezerman curlers are much better."
2,Not very impressed.,"This curler does not work any better than any of the ones from the drug store. In fact, I would say it is WORSE than the drug store eyelash curlers. It does not curl lashes at all without mascara. The worst part is that the replaceable rubber cushion does not stay in place on the curler. It falls out as soon as you set the thing down. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to find the cushion part in the bottom of my makeup bag. Don't waste your money. Rather disappointing."
2,not great,Its cute but doesn't work very well. Had the Shu Uemera(sp?) and wore out the pads so I got this one because I didn't want to pay for shipping at Sephora but the Mally does not curl my lashes at all. Ended up buying a Revlon one for much less at the store and it is better than this one.
1,Well the design looked promising...,"I was very hopeful, especially since the design is supposed to keep from pinching you. The problem? This is called Get The Last Lash LASH CURLER. It did not curl the first lash or the last lash. I tried it several times, both with and without mascara. It never worked. I really didn't even want to give this one star, but consider it an E for Effort since the design looked so promising."
4,"Fast shipping, Nice walker","Overall I like the unit, but must say it's not quite as heavy duty as I had hoped. Dad likes to sit in it and use it like a wheel chair. That seems to be stressing the wheel mounts some. So far not a problem, but I can see how this may be a problem in the future. I noticed they make a similar unit like this that has the wheels mounted directly under the legs not on the side of the legs. But so far I've been happy with the unit."
5,Well worth the money,"I bought this for my mother. She was somewhat skeptical because it being on 4 wheels. She has severe arthritis and was unsure if she would be able to handle the brakes. Product arrived before the scheduled date, I was able to put it together in less than 10 minutes, and she can easily handle the brakes. All in all this has been a great purchase for her. I highly recommend this for anyone needing assistance when walking. Amazon price is about one third to one half the price of the same thing at a medical supply store!"
4,Medline Wlker,The walker arrived in perfect condition. The basket holds needed items freeing up the users hands to operate the walker in a safe manner. After a little getting used to the brakes my mother in law is moving around fine. Brakes can be pushed downward to lock the rear wheels. Had the walker folded up a little smaller I would have rated it higher. All in all it is a nicely designed walker and we are pleased with this purchase.
3,Medline Deluxe Folding Rollator Walker,"I did not realize that this type of walker is not recommended by most Physical Therapists. The problem is that some elderly don't know how to use the brakes to control the walker and it gets too far ahead of them. When this happens they are leaning too far forward, or they have planted their face or knees on the floor or pavement.The benefit is that the person doesn't have to pause/stop while walking like they do with the box stand type walker. Those only have wheels on the front so the back either is dragged or the elder has to stop and pick up the walker and place it in front of them.Guess it all depends if your user can work and remember how to use the brakes. If not, this walker is not for you.Thanks,Medical Patriot"
2,"Functional but heavy, doesn't fold compactly","This seems to be a good rollator, but was a big waste of money for my elderly relative. He lives in a house with both interior and exterior stairs, and this is too heavy to him to lift up and down those stairs.Also, it doesn't fold as compactly as other Medline rollators. There is only one folding axis between the two sets of legs--barely reducing the size and footprint compared to the fully open position."
5,Great product! Totally worth the purchase.,"Great buy, took it to overseas, cannot be more happy with the price and quality. Strongly recommended."
5,Great,Gave this to my Mother-in-law who is 93 and she she loves it. Great product and fantastic price .
4,Good,"I bought this for my dad, who can't walk or sit for long time, it worked out great. It occupies lot of space and there was not manual of the sort, we figured it our how to put it on brakes. Functionally great!"
5,Great chair at a great price,"This was purchased for my elderly mother, and she loves it! She says it rolls so easily and she feels very comfortable using it. Obviously she is much steadier with this than with the cane she was using. Best price here too. The first chair got sidetracked en route when apparently the shipping label got torn, and Amazon promptly got a replacement sent out for two-day shipping at no charge to me. I'm very happy with Amazon and this purchase."
5,Walker,This is an excellent product especially for its price. We have tried more expensive walkers and this steers more easily due to its bigger wheels.
3,Color different,"The picture online showed a light green. This was the reason I picked it. When I received it, the color was dark green. I didn't see it unitl I was in the sun. I was really was disappointed. The walker itself was fine."
5,Don't hesitate,"If you have any interest at all in Brahms' violin sonatas don't hesitate to purchase these performances. I have heard Perlman/Ashkenazy, Suk/Katchen and quite a few others but none of them beat Szeryng and Rubinstein. They make the music dance. The sound is first rate."
2,Rare Dud,"I bought this cd because of the many wonderful LPs which featured Szeryng or Rubenstein in combinations with other greats of my youth. It is a Dud. Any -wonders of articulation, tone, or phrasing the artists tried to express were squelched by terrible reproduction techniques. Even though it's inexpensive, avoid it. It's a waste of time and money.An Old Appreciator"
3,"cumbersome, weird reception",A lot of wires going on and you have to position all the pieces the right way so you don't get intereference and the sound is clear.
2,Very disappointed!,"After searching online and reading reviews, I chose this highchair for my 2 year old for Christmas. BIG mistake! Imagine our disappointment when at 2am on Christmas Eve we cannot put it together properly because in THREE different places, the screws don't fit! Two were too short, so the tray keeps falling off, and one was way too long, so now it sticks out on the side, creating a safety hazard. Since we had no other alternative, we let her play with on Christmas day, but now we are searching for another high chair and plan to return this one. Sure it's sturdy enough for her to sit in it, but that doesn't too much good with screws sticking out and falling out. Do not buy! It's a piece of junk!"
1,No Quality,"This doll highchair is junk. It has been put together less than 24 hours and had one dolly in it and it is no longer useable. The tray has fallen off from both sides. The seat fabric is just that a piece of fabric stapled on and it looks tacky, but never mind that the lace trim is shredding into shambles. It has come unsewn. It was only six inches of sewing and that couldn't last. I did give it two stars for education value. I have learned that I probably won't purchase this brand of doll toys. I tried to get my daughter and each grand daughter a different kind of series of dolly thing but I think I will stick with Zapf brand and some will just have duplicates. My poor grand daughter got the short end of the stick her birthday present was a flop. Sherill"
2,broken,"This was a gift for my Grand daughter, opened the box and it was broken. Was able to repair it with the help of some glue, but I may suggest better packing. Apart from that, it's a nice high chair for the money."
2,came broken,guess you get what you pay for in this case. Item came broken with a sharp screw sticking out. Its cute but not well made
2,not solid wood,"I was so excited about getting this for my girls, but when my husband put it together Christmas morning, the trays where crooked, he actually broke one trying to fix it. There are only 2 tiny pieces on the whole thing that are wood the rest is MDF. it looks cute, but we are very disappointed."
3,Good for the price.,"Good for the price, easy to assemble but overall quality not the best. Wish I would have paid the extra bucks for the Kid Kraft or Melissa and Doug high char. Overall it's OK, not horrible but not the best."
3,Adorable but missing screws,We bought this for our two year old daughter for Christmas and luckily enough put it together before Christmas eve because we ended up having to BUY screws for it because two screws were not even included. Disappointing. All in all it worked out and is absolutely adorable.
2,high chair.,"Love the way it looks, but the product broke very easy. The tiny screws pull right out of the wood. This lasted only a couple months"
2,Tray will not stay screw on,"Put it together by instructions, the screws keep coming out of the tray to chair. Stepping up to locktight not very safe for a 3 yr old if screws will not stay in place."
2,Ugh!!,"You get what you pay. The online picture is nice, the real thing is cheap looking and when you put it together the holes don't quite align up. If they do align up then don't attempt to screw the bolt all the way in as they won't go in. The material is cheap so if you handle it as you have to in order to put it together you're left with bruises on the material. I've spent less money on things like this and had better results."
3,Very easy to put together and sturdy,I is sturdy and was easy to put together. I wouldn't say its the greatest quality but for the price it is well worth it and my daughters love it!
1,Unsatisfied Customer,This was given as a gift on Nov. 3rd. My grandaughter loved this highchair and played with it for only one week and the tray completely broke off. She is devastated and I am very dissapointed with the construction of this toy. Please do not waste your money. Find a different brand to try.
2,"Cute, but broke the next day","Santa brought this for my 3 year old for Christmas last year. She loved it & played with it all day and then it broke the next day! The tray is put together poorly, and it just came apart. It was heart breaking to see her crying because she really did like it a lot. I glued it back together with Gorilla glue twice now, but it has broken every time. It is in my to-do pile now to be fixed because I am going to have to use some hardware to do it right and hopefully that will work!"
5,My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this toy,I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter who loves her baby dolls. My daughter put this chair together with just a screwdriver. It is sturdy and has a very smooth finish. I do think the age for this toy should be changed to 2-4 years old. The chair is perfect for a young mommy!
3,Screws too long!!!!,The screws for the tray were way too long and we couldn't even get them in. My husband had to cut them so they would fit. Not very happy with this purchase. Cute but assesmbly took way longer then it should. Also alot smaller then I was expecting.
3,Poor Manufacturing but Cute,"Screw holes for attaching the tray portion were drilled on the wrong side of the arm. Impossible to assemble without your own drill. Then of course you are left with open holes where the wrong holes were put by the manufacturer. The screws were of the cheapest quality. They are wood screw without a point on the end (very difficult to work with). They stripped after about 5 turns (only halfway to in place) luckily they were so cheap (soft metal) I could make new groves in the screw top by pressing firmly. My daughter hasn't played with it yet, but I think she will love it. It looks cute, I wish the tray was slightly bigger, it is narrow for even the small plate that comes with the highchair."
1,Badger Doll Highchair,"First, it wasn't the highchair that I ordered. This highchair was substituted, which I did not appreciate since I was not contacted for the approval of the substitution. The chair is cheaply made. The leg construction is flat, not very sturdy and I was concerned about my grandaughters trying to sit in the chair themselves. I ordered three. Since it was too late to return for the chair that I ordered, I decided to put one together to see what it looked like and how sturdy the chair was. There were parts missing from the box that I opened, so I decided to just ship them back for credit. This high chair has only one brace across the bottom. The other chair had all four legs braced. I didn't get to see the other chair, so I cannot say for sure if I would have been satisfied with it either. Very disappointing for sure!"
5,Very good product esp for the price!,"""Santa"" gave this to my daughter when she was 20 months old, along with other doll furniture from Badger Basket. I was very impressed by the overall durability of the wood and size of the Badger Basket products. They were much bigger than I had anticipated, but in a good way. They were also easy to assemble. I particularly liked the high chair because I was so pleasantly surprised by how big and cute it was for such a low price. The little tray lifts up, and my daughter loves it. The little plate/bib/spoon are all cheap but the chair by itself is worth more than the price. We bought all this to go with the Pottery Barn Kids baby doll, and it was the perfect size for it. Overall, I would recommend this as a good, durable toy, especially for this price. I would saw it's as good as the Pottery Barn Kids doll furniture and for about 2/3 the price."
2,Not sturdy...lasted 2 days before breaking!,"This highchair is adorable but it is a piece of crap! My two year old got it for christmas and its already break just a few days later. The tray ripped off from the highchair just from opening and closing it. While my husband can wood glue and clamp it, the quality is obviously not there. I would pick a different option, since this only lasted a few days. If it were better quality, it would have been a great choice because it fits her babies great and it was easy for a two year old to get her babies in and out."
1,Broke 1st Day. Very poor quality,This is very poorly made not of good quality. My daughter is 4 and used it literally two times and it is falling apart. Very disappointing buy.
3,"Like it, but tray is flemsy","My daughter loves this high chair. It is a nice size and easy to put together. The only complaint I have is the tray came apart (it hadnt even been played with yet) where it attaches to the chair. The screw is just not strong enough. It could pose a danger if it broke when being played with, as the screw is sharp. We had to use gorilla glue to fix it and it seems to be fine now."
4,"Quality, easy assembly","We received this highchair as a gift and my 2 year old loves it. It is of good quality and seems pretty durable. The tray moves up and down which is a nice addition, although it would be nice if it was a little bigger (to fit more than just one plate and cup). I put together the chair easily using an electric screwdriver in about 10 minutes. I recommend this product for any little girl who likes to play with dolls."
2,It broke.,"The tray ripped off. And it came without the washers it's supposed to have to let the arms raise and lift freely. Such potential, but it turned out to be junk."
3,Sweety but....,"This little highchair looks so cute but the bib is really too small and with tie straps it is not useable for the age group intended. Needs to be valcroe fastening. The tray is also quite small and broke within three months and my daughter was not heavy handed or rough with it. ( It was repairable with glue and screws.) Size wise this chair would not suit your barbie or similar sized doll, it is more suited to the cabbage patch sized doll. On its own this toy has limited play value. Only one use or purpose but in conjunction with other toys in the role playing, such as kitchen and bed etc it can add to the play scenario. Best bet is to look to purchase this when it is sold in combination with other toys. (Which I have seen.) Then you will get value for money!"
5,No issues at all - daughter loves it!!,"Our daughter (age 2) loves the chair and I had no issues putting it together at all. It's adorable and good quality, yet light enough that she can move it around. If I had to find a negative, I wish it had a little stopper under the tray table (between where the doll's legs go) so the dolls don't slide out if she pushes them down too far (this ""problem"" has only happened once). It's also super cute and matches perfectly with their crib that has storage underneath. Love the Badger Basket products!!"
2,Don't waste your money,"We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and upon assembly we were shocked at how flimsy this product is. We thought ""Wooden highchair, that'll be a nice toy that lasts!"" We were wrong. This will probably last a month or two with careful play. Should have bought something plastic..."
2,Get what you pay for...,One of the pre-drilled holes was not in the right spot but the hubby simply redrilled. Went together fairly easy. After about two weeks of normal play the the arms disconnected for the tray.I glue it and it fine but would not recommend for high quality.
2,Very disappointed in this product,"This little highchair was for my grand daughter. It broke in one day of playing. She was very upset that she could no longer use it. This should never have happened, and I feel that the price was exorbitant considering how long it lasted."
1,It's broken:(,"It's three days after Christmas and this is already broken :(. My daughter tried to pull up the tray and it slammed down, exposing the sharp nails used to put it together. I do not recommend this high chair."
4,Works exactly as advertised,"Love this camera. Perfect gift item. The camera is retro style, very compact, and fancy with a large LCD. Love face-detection feature that automatically detects multiple faces and focuses each one, adjusts flash level accordingly to avoid under/overexposed images and blurred individuals on the edges. Obviously compact means multifunction buttons that can slow you down while setting up the right photo option. Also, the body's steel finish sometimes leaves fingerprints. ""Some"" grainy picture quality at max zoom and very low light without flash may dissapoint you a little. All in all, you can't go wrong with a canon camera."
5,A great little camera,"A friend of mine recommended this Canon PowerShot. She has a SD600 and when I found the SD1000 she was impressed. It is everything she said it is. Point and shoot and the quality of the pictures is outstanding.It is very user friendly. I appreciate that, being 'technically challenged'. I figured out the video feature without the booklet. Now that's easy.I would recommend it to anyone."
4,my beautiful new camera,"I bought this camera because my Powershot sd600 had gotten stolen. I got this one from Amazon, with a 1G sd card and a leather carrying pouch and it all costs me about the same as the sd600 alone. I was very pleased with this. As the far as the actual performance of the camera, I couldn't be happier. My pictures and movies come out nicely every time. The only downside is that the camera is kind of slow in actually taking the picture. A friend of mine has the sd630 and she noticed the difference in speed immediately."
4,Great Camera,I bought this camera a few years ago. When my ex girlfriend moved out she stole it. In order to buy it new it would cost $300-$399 dollars. I bought used it off of this seller for under a $100 bucks. The seller was great and included a nice case. It might not have all the bells and whistles of newer cameras like HD video ability but it gets the job done for under $100 bucks. I am grateful to this seller. Great camera.
1,Blurry in low light or distance,"This camera started off ok. It takes a decent point and shoot image. There are however too many cons.Pros:LightweightPocket sizeGood general picture takingGood scenery cameraCons:Terrible in low light no matter the distanceCompletely useless in concerts/etcZoom is limitingBlurry pictures with the slightest shakingIf zoomed in all the way, it will never be clearJust poor quality for canon... keeps me from ever buying another canonI need something with good low-light. We attend a lot of concerts and I simply am frustrated that I can NEVER get a clean and focused picture."
4,Surprising picture quality and good battery life,"I bought this camera to use on an extended vacation this summer to some national parks out west. It's exceptionally easy to use and took excellent pictures, some of which we had printed in 11x17 size with great results. It's easy to use, is small enough for a shirt pocket, and the controls are intuitive. One drawback - while the LCD display is great indoors or on overcast days outdoors, don't count on being able to see the display on a bright sunny day. Learn to use the rangefinder and experiment with photos until you understand the difference in coverage of the rangefinder and LCD views. I took only still photos, and not many flash pictures, but the battery never ran down, even on days when we took 100 or so pictures."
5,Canon Powershot SD1000,"The camera is great. It is quite small and takes wonderful pictures. I'm still learning how to use all of the features, but it is very easy to use."
4,"great camera, great price","i'm still getting used to it as there are a lot of different settings, but i love this camera. so small and easy to use and takes great pictures. my old camera was a canon elph and this one is the latest and greatest, and amazon sold it for such a fantastic price i couldn't resisit."
4,Perfect little camera for convenice,"I've always brought the Elph series due to its size, convenice of use and quality.. The SD1000, doesn't disappoint either in this regard.. The camera is still so simple that a 5yr old could master some of the more advance functions very easy.. The easy change of mode is a god-sent, something I found extremely difficult with the Nikon I had as a quick to have camera, til I got a canon again.The only major disappointment I have is on the zoom.. I would love to have a higher optical zoom than 3x times but If you use the digital and have a very steady hand - you can still get some amazing pictures.All and all, the 1000 again shows why for me I'm a loyal customer to the elph series and I hope canon keeps it as one as their flagship versions as we go into deeper technology advances"
5,Great little camera,"I cannot real add anything new to the discussion re: this camera's merits. It has all been said by others. So why write anything at all? Because I'm immature. Anyway-I ended up with this camera after buying a Sony T-100.The appeal of a small pocketable camera is obvious. Still I want a camera to do everything regardless of size. Well-the Sony I did not think took good pictures but not very good in terms of image qualiy. And it is very pricey for what they give you & what you have to buy extra.So I bought this gem-my first Canon. I guess I am a slow learner-Canon makes very nice well built, well thought out cameras. I have enjoyed this camera immensely. I guess my one minor gripe is that I wish the images were just a little sharper-though they are very good anyway. A little post processing works wonders.To sum it up-this camera is flexible, small, has great color saturation, and takes very good pictures. What more could one ask for at this price point?"
2,"Takes fuzzy, out of focus pictures","Con: flimsy plastic doors.Con: poor button placement means you can change the settings while you hold it to shoot.EXTREME CON:Even after fooling around with every setting possible and taking hundreds of shots, they turn out to be fuzzy, usually out of focus whether distant or nearby. Some may describe this in their reviews as ""soft focus'. It's not, it's 'out of focus'. This is something I don't expect from a Canon. I own an older S400 Elph that takes much sharper pictures. Do not buy this camera.I am amending this review. I have now taken several hundred MORE shots. The thing does a lousy job of focusing. Yes, I am an adult with plenty of picture-taking experience. Do not buy this camera."
1,Image quality disappointment,"Bought it for my mom's birthday. Decided to compare picture quality indoors with my good old Fuju FinePix F30. Oh, why did I do it? :( At ISO 1600 my oldie kicked Canon's behind really hard. My mom loves taking pictures indoors :( Sorry, mom."
5,A Great Camera,"I wanted a small phone that I could carry while running, yet was flexible in many environments. This camera is so good, that I was able to make a good copy of a TV short in movie mode. Take a little time to read the instructions, and the camera will give you great service. I upgraded from the Canon SD400 which is still giving great service to a friend."
4,"Form, fit and function","Love:a) The shape and size - fits perfectly in a tight jeans pocket. Perfect for taking on the go anywhere, esp partiesb) Appearance - it is actually sleeker than it looks in its picturesc) Usability - all the functions that I use frequently are available as dedicated buttons (turn flash off; delete picture; etc)Hate:Nothing really. The only reason I've not had the results I've wanted is because of my own lack of knowledge of why it wouldn't take some pictures in a low light condition, and what I can do to override that situation."
5,J. E. Meyer St.Louis,"I got my camera very quickly. It arrived in just one day after order was placed in perfect condition. I am pleased with the pictures I have taken and the ease of use. As a point and shoot set up for my wife,who hates complicated cameras, it is great. I am more of a gadet guy and like the special effects that the camera offers also. I've owned several small Canon cameras and this one offers the best bang for your buck. I would recomend this camera to a friend."
2,Okay for general use,"I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable.Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month."
3,Too complicated for basic point-and-shoot,"I'm not a photographer, and was looking for a good point and shoot to use for work. So far, this camera has been a nightmare. The picture quality is great - the problem is that the camera has so many functions, and such awful documentation (hello? it shouldn't take hours to figure out how to erase video accidentally shot by a four-year-old) that figuring out how to use it will take up many, many of your waking hours. Do not recommend as a basic point-and-shoot."
2,Close up? NOT.,"I bought this camera to be able to shoot close ups with the macro mode. Very disappointed. I was never able to shoot at close range and have the the picture turn out. Very grainy!The software was not easily installed. You need to read the directions from 3 differant instruction booklets that came with it. A little bit of info from one book, a little more from another etc. I purchase this thinking it would be a great camera from reading all the ""great"" feedbacks. Not sure why someone would recommend this one."
1,Lens error--had to send it in twice for repairs already,"The camera is nice when it works. I have owned the camera for 9 months and sent it in twice for fixing a stuck lens. Google for ""canon powershot lens error"", and you will find many similar tales of woe.You pay for the first shipping, and then they will pay shipping for repeat repairs, but it takes them a l o o o o n g time to email you a shipping label.You can't talk to anyone in Customer Relations either. They'll take your number and promise to call you back in 24-72 hours.Given that there are many happy users, not everyone has this problem, but if you do, then Canon will not replace your camera. They will fix it, fix it again, and then your warranty will be up. When the lens is stuck again, you are best off buying a new camera from another manufacturer."
5,PowerShot SD 1000 is a great gift,"Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)I purchased this camera for my son's birthday. He was extremely pleased with it's features and is having excellent results with it's use. The only problem is that there is only a 32K memory stick which is an inadequate amount of memory. This being said, I would highly recommend the camera because it takes great pictures."
1,unhappy first try,Maybe it was a just a one in a million error. The one I bought did not work. Nice looking camera but I could not get it to take still pictures. The control settings would not work and I could only do movies. Hmmm.
5,WOW,"This little camera is completely AMAZING!!! I was in the market for a new camera and read about this one. It's so small it fits into anything and is really easy to carry around. It takes wonderful pictures and has lots of different settings that are fun to play with. :) It's perfect for those fun days at Disney or an outing with friends. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone!! I am sooo happy with it. If I had it to do over again, I would definitely purchase this."
4,Canon PowerShot SD1000,This is my first digital camera. I just got back from a week's vacation in Las Vegas and I took 140+ pictures with my camera. I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures. The camera is small and easy to use. I was happy that I found a way to imprint the date on my pictures. My sister-in-law recommended this camera and I'm glad she did. It was well worth the money spent.
5,A great camera!,"I bought this for my wife who wanted a small camera that she could carry in her purse. Full of features, compact and best of all, great pictures. For an everyday snapshot type camera, you can not go wrong with this one. We have been Kodak people for the past 5 years and I am sold on Canon now.The price to value ratio is very high in my opinion. I think you get a lot of camera for you dollar!"
5,Canon PowerShot Digital Elph Camera,"I recently purchased two of the Canon PowerShot Digital Elph Camera's, one for my daughter and one for myself. We both agree that this little camera has more bang for it's buck than any other of it's kind on the market. We couldn't be more pleased with all of the funtions and ease of use it offers. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a digital camera to capture all of their life's moments."
1,Poor image quality,This is my second Canon camera (my first the LCD cracked due to getting stepped on) I had many friends tell me how good Canon is but for some reason I noticed the older the camera gets the crappier the pictures get! It's pretty much impossible to get a clear crisp picture with this camera now that I've had it for over a year! Even if my 1 year old holds still for a picture 90% of the time it comes out looking fuzzy or blurred. When I first got it I was able to get decent pictures but now it's not even worth my time to snap a pic because it will come out crappy and you can't tell from the LCD screen that it looks terrible. It does have some fun features on the camera like being able to select out a color while taking a picture but who needs that feature if you can't get a clear picture!
2,Lens problem,I used this camera for about 8 months with no problems. On vacation the camera had a lens error problem. Before you buy this camera google lens error problems on this camera. I was amazed that they had so many complaints.
5,Amazing Camera,"This is by far the best camera I had -digital one I meant. It is perfect for those who want to take great pictures, easy to used. Camera for those who want to click and get it. My fast review list1. Perfect size2. Great and bright display3. Takes pictures quickly - press and shot.4. Take amazing videos -this is not the main feature but I didn't expect those great videos from a small camera -not professional but great to be shared.5. Easy to use6. Accelerometers included -means camera detects the photo direction -you don't have to rotate them."
4,Great point and shoot,"I have owned this camera for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. It's small and lightweight, looks cool and takes nice quality pics both indoor and outdoor. The face recognition is a nice feature too and works well. Buy some memory and a case for it though - its sturdy but you won't want it to get scratched. Great camera for the money."
3,Average Camera,"I have been an avid Canon user for some years now, and was hoping to find a small, budget Canon camera that I could carry around and take casual pictures with. Luckily, I haven't had any problems with the lens jamming - but I'm somewhat disappointed by the picture quality. It seems no matter what light, the pictures are grainier than what I was hoping the camera would deliver. Not surprisingly, this issue is exacerbated by low lighting.As far as size, the camera fits perfectly into any pocket, and is fairly lightweight. I love the LCD response to turning the camera - though I find that I have to give the camera a light tap sometimes to remind it to flip an image in a given direction.I don't regret purchasing the camera entirely, I just really wish the picture quality was a bit better."
5,Great little Happy Snaps Camera,"Well I know this is not the most recent model of Canon PowerShot but I sure love it...and if I were going to replace this camera I would purchase the newest one! It is sturdy, easy to operate, long battery life, greatin-camera editing. I use the zoom a lot, and if it is not too dark I can hand hold while zooming for non flash shots, which are my favorite. It has easy view screen size so I hardly every use the in camera view finder. The resolution is fine enough to crop your photo and still have a decent8 by 10 finished photo. As for the shutter response time, pretty good for a little point and shoot type camera."
4,Very good portable camera,I've been using this camera for a while now and have only run into a few issues. The first is probably my own fault because I tend to shake the camera when I take pictures. Sometimes the picture comes out blurry because of this. The second issue is the shake icon appears when I zoom in too much... even when I use a tripod. The last issue is the change color mode dosn't really work that well. Other than those three things the camera is a pretty good portable camera.
5,A great little camera,"We have had this camera for 2 1/2 years. It has gone with us rafting down the Grand Canyon, filmed video as we downhill skied, and captured all of our great family moments. It has been very handy to toss in a purse or pocket, so it is always close at hand.This is a wonderful snapshot camera. It has a fast focus and is extremely portable.This is not a great camera for night shots or sports events. It just isn't the right stlye camera for those types of photos.Love this little camera!"
3,Great product but not durable,"Used the camera for 2 years. It has great picture quality. A very good point and shoot camera for the price. After a fall the camera gave the ""Error reading lens"" error and the customer service asked almost the same price as the camera for repair."
1,Nice camera but very fragile,"Read the other reviews for info about image quality and such. I am very satisfied with the photos that I have taken with my camera and I especially like the built in panorama mode which allows you to take a series of shots and stitch them together to create a panorama. However, I have had my camera for a little over a year and it has broken 4 times - 3 times the lens would not retract and once the lcd screen cracked. I have an extended warranty that covered all of these problems but each time it breaks, I have another 4 weeks without a camera because I have to ship it off."
5,Incredible Point & Shoot,"I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone considering a point and shoot camera - this camera blows me away. The picture quality is awesome and is an excellent value for the money. I just recently upgraded to the Canon Rebel XSI SLR but I am keeping this camera for those times you don't want to drag your SLR outfit with you. I wish I could share the pictures I was able to take with this camera with you, but you could always do a search on Flickr.Pros:- As automatic or manual as you want it to be,outstanding macros,- Great color,- Kids and Pets mode great for action shots,- Size - easily fits in your pocket,- Takes awesome video as well,- Color accent mode is an awesome affect that takes forever to do manually in photo editing software,- Battery life is great - lasted from open to close at Disney World, averaging over 200 photos and videos per day,- Considering how small the camera is, the LCD is greatCons: No battery meter - really, no other con!"
5,Very good camera,This is a very good and easy to use camera. Excelent pictures. Great quality of videos and sound. Great Camera. Good price
4,"Terrific camera, but no IS","Cutest camera I've seen to date. Light as anything, so be careful when you carry it. Great photos, surprised how well the flash works. Had an SD410 prior to this one and this upgrade made a big difference in both carry weight and performance. Unbelievably fast startup. First concern I had when I took it out of the box was the thought that people are going to drop this little fella as soon as you hand it over to some tourist to take snaps of you and the family. Be sure to get an silicon skin case to keep it protected at all times. Oh, and get the retro-looking black and white version of this -- looks very cool."
4,great small camera,"I wasn't using my old Canon Rebel xt because it was so bulky I just didn't want to carry it. This new camera takes pictures that are just as good (although I miss my 200 mm zoom lens at times), and it fits in my pocket, so I use it a lot more. Simple to use, but has lots of good picture taking power."
3,Good Camera but not great Camera,"I bought this Camera having the great experience from Canon A540, but frankly I would say, the quality I feel is much better in my earlier model. I am not very much impressed with this Camera. The best thing in this camera is portability, it is very small and you won't feel that you are carrying something. I liked the box shape also. If you are looking for a best performance, turn it to superfine quality, then only you will get good pictures, otherwise, you will get a dull shade on your top corners in the picture."
5,The Workhorse of Our Family,"I have been a freelance photographer for over 20 years now. I got this camera for my wife several years ago so that she could play around and leave my expensive DSLRs alone. She uses nearly every function including the video with our daughter. In fact I find myself grabbing this camera when we want to travel light and leave all my equipment behind. It can't do everything a DSLR can (not even close), but I have captured some amazing shots with it. In all a great buy, the battery lasts a long time and menu is simple to use."
4,This is good for what it is,"This is a handy little camera for documenting your life. The quality isn't stunning so I wouldn't use it to create art or super large prints but it's great for events. It's very sturdy. I carried it around in my purse for years and it was fine. It's pretty good in low light or without a flash, which I like. There are lots of fun settings to chose from and it connected to my mac with zero problem. The size is pretty small so I could slip it in a jacket pocket. I don't use it anymore since I got an iphone for my party pictures and a fancier camera for travel/artistic type stuff. My mom also owns this camera and she uses it all the time."
5,A lot of magic in a little package,"I already had a Canon digital camera, but an older model. I rarely used it because I want to take pictures of a child, and those precious expressions are so fleeting and the older camera just wasn't fast enough. My old film camera did a better job. THIS camera, the Canon PowerShot SD1000 Digital ELPH is ""a whole 'nuther story!"" My daughter spent 15 months in Afghanistan, and as she was whisked from place to place by car or helicopter she would shoot scenes out the side window---at those speeds---and still get great pictures. Other people would give her THEIR digital cameras, hoping for the same results but, like my other model, they just weren't fast enough. She suggested I might look for a used model, and I was surprised to find they exist, in great condition, at a great price. I'm still learning about all the things one can do with this little camera. The options and special effects are amazing. So I'm delighted!"
3,Lots of crappy pictures without the image stabalizer,This camera is small and compact and travels nicely. But it has no image stabalizer. I did not not realize how important this was until I saw how badly a lot of my pictures turned out. I will return this camera and get the SD800.
5,SD1000 Canon Rocks,"Had Sony and Olympus prior. this sd1000 takes great pictures, is very easy to use. My laptop recognized right away didnt even have to load software. the camera takes pictures very fast (delay between pics is or time between when you can snap shots is not at all noticable) Old camera took about 15 or 20 Seconds between shots this one is immediate. Very Happy....Definately buy this one"
3,No RAW photo capability,"JUST so you know this Canon does NOT shoot in Raw file format. I was replacing an SD40 and ASSUMED that the higher model # meant more and better features.. Oh well not the case. ALSO the ""sleek"" case is very slippery. Make sure you purchase some EGrips to stick on the camera and keep it from falling out of your pocket"
5,great little camera,"If you're looking for a camera that's small enough to tuck in your purse or pocket yet powerful enough to do everything you expect out of a point and shoot camera, then this one's for you."
3,"good camera,breaks easily","I've owned two of these cameras and they are great. small and can fit in your pocket.BUT if you drop it even one time,it WILL BREAK.the lens breaks very easily and the camera's viewfinder won't close. it's too expensive to fix it so you have to buy a whole new camera.I would think with how great the rest of the camera is Canon could work on fixing that.I guess they like us buying their cameras all the time though :/"
5,Good camera for nice price,"I was really looking for a camera that was small, did not take too long to startup, and did not take too long to recover from shoot with flash .... my old camera suffered from all of the above.This camera met all of my expectations and more.I liked the good video it produced when operating in recording mode.Also the variety of scenes ""Kids and Pets"", ""Night"", etc make for good photo for any occasion.The customizable ""self-timer"" is good for those family photos where all members can be in the shoot ... no one has to be behind the camera to press the button."
5,Love the Canon PowerShot SD1000,I purchased the SD1000 to take on a trip to Ireland and Germany. I just wanted a small camera that I could just point and click. This camera took awesome pictures and was very easy to use and carry around. I also took some digital video clips that turned out great. I love the large LCD viewer. I just can't think of any negatives about this little gem.
5,Solid Buy,"This is a really good camera. I wont go into too many details, but it is extremely compact, when I got it in the mail I was truly surprised at how small it is, which is pretty cool. The pictures I have taken so far are good quality. I also really appreciate the rechargeable battery. To me that makes a lot more sense then having to buy hundreds of triple A's over the lifetime of the camera. I highly recommend this camera, you get your money's worth!"
1,Cracked LCD,"I bought this camera in April and by the end of July it was useless due to a cracked LCD screen. Constantly kept in a case, always attached to wrist while in use, and never dropped. There was no apparent damage to the external portion of the screen. I returned it to Canon for repair and they declared the damage my fault (impact/pressure) and want to charge me $100 to fix. It was a great camera while it lasted but way too fragile."
2,Image quality poor...,"I don't think i have ever commented on anything before but I felt compelled this time around. I got my new SD1000 just a week ago and I must say while it is stylish and takes pictures very quickly... a very intuitive interface, very easy to use and the battery charges quite quickly..not everything is great....The biggest and most important issue i have is that it takes VERY poor pictures if the lighting isn't optimal. Most of my pictures come out with very grainy and this is with the auto ISO set or off. I have owned other Canon cameras and the quality of this one is by far the poorest to date. Very disappointed. I can't return the camera so I am either going to try and sell it or hand it over to younger sisters. I will have to get another cam now. *sigh*. Oh, it doesn't do video capture zoom either so take note."
3,Canon Powershot,"I bought one of these cameras for my mother and My husband gave me one since it is small and I can stash it in my purse and carry it with me everyday. It is an average camera if you want to take snap shots.If you use the large size settings it is very grainy. For the price it is a fun camera with settings for foliage, underwater, macro, pets and children, and many many more, some hidden so far in the menu you should read the manual or you will never find them.You can change to manual, ISO goes to 1600. The nice thing is when you change the settings you can actually see what will be shot on the view screen. Bump the F-stop up or down and you can actually see what it will look like before snapping the photo.A fun camera to play with and have with you those times you wish you had brought a camera but it will never ever even come close to replacing my Digital Rebel.Our Daughter has one also she has the SD750 and it has a larger view screen but seems to be the same camera."
5,Buy Cannon for quality!!,We have 3 Cannon cameras and one Cannon Printer in our family. No one can beat their overall quality!!!!
3,Only good for outdoor and static items,"Canon Powershot SD1000 has more functions with good price. It's a replacement for my Canon PowerShot SD330, which I enjoyed it for almost 4 years. Canon Powershot SD330 took very nice acceptable and clear pictures indoor when I took my son's pictures.I like what Canon Powershot SD1000 performance under sunlight well outdoor spot. It's very colorful and clear.However, it's worse comparing with SD330 when I used it indoor even I turn on most lights at home. No matter auto or manual modes, It cannot even catch any item clear without flash, and the picture pixels are way big. (You don't want to hurt your baby's eyes.) It never catched up my son's action even I opened the kid/pet mode. (SD330 is still doing fine indoor with auto and no flash.)I wished Canon Powershot SD 1000 doing better with its new functions and technologies, but the end out it that I am still using SD330 for taking all indoor pictures."
4,Very Pleased,"I purchased this camera after reading the reviews on Amazon. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use. I was concerned with whether it would work with my new macbook computer becuase Canon says they haven't tested it on the new macs yet, but it works without a problem. I hooked it up and it downloaded the pics without any problems.A few concerns, though. I have small hands and fingers so this isn't a problem for me, but people with larger hands - especially men - may have a harder time using the camera due to the small buttons. In addition, I am not used to having a camera with a battery that charges. I am used to cameras with regular AA or AAA batteries. Having to charge the battery takes some getting used to just because you have to plan in advance to make sure it's charged before planning on using it. I suggest possibly buying a backup.Overall, though I HIGHLY recommend."
5,Great shots!!,"I love this camera. It has been wonderful for the past year. From birthdays to parties to snow to the aquarium, this camera has been fabulous. I wouldn't recommend anything else."
4,Canon SD1000,"Very good camera for the money...Does have some flaws. Doesn't take as good pictures as a bigger camera, but one can to fit the camera into ones purse or shirt pocket. If one just want a camera for that reason, its great. The recording option works great too for such a small camera."
1,Lens Retraction Problem,"Its been a fine camera for the first 18 months I've had it, but I'd started to get the odd barrel error, and then on a trip to Muir Woods its stuck in the open position completely. It appears to be a common complaint about Canon cameras, but who knows. I am just annoyed it wont let me upload my photos in this broken mode, and there is no way to reset it. So I guess I'm stuck with a 1-200 dollar repair. I think I'll get a Nikon next time. I probably should have the first time. If the iPhone would improve its awful camera, I'd be using that by itself."
4,Great little camera with solid image quality.,"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my mother. My mother was never really into taking pictures, but when I loaned her one of my digital cameras for a trip, she ended up taking quite a few pictures and enjoying it. I thought this would be a nice gift, and I was right. She loved that it is so small and easy to take with her.Build quality is generally good, though the battery door is very flimsy feeling, and the tripod mount is plastic. The lens is average in aperture and range, but of good quality. The pictures turned out nicely, although you will have to deal with an occasional blurry corner. It's also very easy to use, with a great screen.I would have liked it better if it had an image stabilizer, but you can't have it all, and at the price, it's a trade-off you have to make. My mother will not miss it, as I'm sure she has no idea what it is anyhow."
4,Powershot SD1000,"I've had previous older versions of the Canon Powershot camera. While this camera has the same functions look and feel as the older Powershots, I was a little surprised at its manufacturing quality -- more plastic less metal. Nonetheless it takes great pictures recovers quickly between shots and is just as good if not better than my older Canon cameras."
4,Good,"Pros: compact, has face recognition, very light weight, good priceCons: no manual controls,3x optical zoom"
3,"Very practical, poor performance.","I bought this camera because I needed one and it was #1 on Amazon at that time. Very compact, easy to use and it has some nice feature. When I took an open-daylight picture at full 7.1 MP, the file was that size, but not the expected quality. Using a zoom function on Photoshop to compare details, a picture taken with my old Sony Cybershot 5.0 MP got far way more details. Every time I use the no-flash function, even with enough light, the resulting picture is a low quality one. The pets-children function (theoretically, this function allow the camera not to be affected by suddenly movement) is practically useless; very nice product otherwise.Ideal for amateur-low exigent users."
3,Great with no Date,"Camera quality is great as you can adjust the image quality and scene. However, there is no DATE function available unless you choose to produce postcards which I find a huge setback. Dont know if I would of even bought knowing no date function under regular circumstances."
5,Nice camera for the cost,"I wanted to get a camera for when I'm out with my friends or on a vacation. This camera is small enough to stuff in a pocket without noticing it. The camera is a great point and shoot camera. There are plenty of settings that can be accessed for different conditions in short order. With a 4GB SDHC memory card I can take approx. 1200 pictures on the highest setting. I'm still testing out the battery life, but from the pictures I've taken that battery would easily last a weekend of photo shooting for say wedding without having to recharge it. I would recommend getting a case, or a Snug-it for this camera as the screen coule be easily scratched.My only complaint is there's no image stability on this model. However, you can change the exposure and ISO settings to prevent blurring of the picture.Overall this was a good buy."
5,Canon Powershot SD1000,I am so far very pleased with this camera. I have only taken xmas pictures but they all turned out great. Red eye still comes out but can be fixed with photo shop. The battery really holds a long charge too. I love the size of this camera how it fits in a pocket. It is perfect for what I want it for.
4,Great pocket camera,"This little camera fits in a shirt pocket or purse easily. Takes great pictures for it's size. Not as good as my 20D, but hey, not as big and not as much money either. My husband uses it with ease, and likes it."
4,This is one great little camera!,"I like this camera, it was a great upgrade from my hp. Small enough to fit anywhere, but it still has a large screen. The picture Quality is excellent - although you get some speckles on the dark pictures when you take the pics with the auto settings - but you would get that too on your average 35mmso i was always a fan of the canon quality in their cameras - this one did not let me down"
5,"Ultra Compact, Sturdy, Great Pictures and Video","I have owned several Digtial Cameras, including a Nikon 950, Canon PowerShot S2 IS, Nikon coolpix. This is by far the best camera I have ever used. The start time is exceptional, pictures are outstanding, great LCD display, and also has a viewfinder. The viewfinder saves battery life and is difficult to find on this small of camera.The PowerShot I own is great for the image stabilzation and excellent zoom, but this is a camera you can tuck into your pocket or purse and be assured of great pictures with mimimal startup time.The other added outstanding feature of this camera is video. Great sound and awesome video quality.For around $217 from Amazon, including shipping, this is a GEM. Highly recommended. You will like this camera."
5,great pictures,"I got this camera home and began to take pictures right away. It was great. The color was real to life and sharp, the details in the picture were crisp and clear, and you can edit red-eye right on the camera before you put it on your computer. This feature is nice. I did own a 4 MP Kodak that was also easy to use, but was too bulky. This feels nice in your hand and will go with me to school events easily. The 32MB SD card that came with it took 7 pictures, so you will have to buy a bigger one. It is easy to download pictues to the computer. Cons: could have come with a cheap case to protect the camera. Due to its small size, it is hard to find a case at store. Very pleased overall. Nice camera."
4,Great point and shoot for the price,"Given the size and price of this digital camera, it takes amazingly good pictures. The digital zoom isn't so great and results in a LOT of noise at higher zoom levels, but for point & shoot situations it works great. Some of the functions & features provided are nice - particularly the color-swap. This is something that used to require Photoshop, but here it is built into the camera.The video capture mode is very usable, but can result in rather shaky clips. The camera is so light and small that any hand twitching gets translated directly into the video - I recommend using a monopod or other stabilizing platform for video use.Overall, the camera is WELL worth the price."
3,Less than 2 months old and getting an error,"Up until yesterday this camera would have gotten 5 stars. It just started to get error ""lens error, restart camera"" regardless of whether it was in replay mode or camera mode. We have since discovered that Canon service is awful. Before you send the camera in for service you must either call them or write them an email. You will then get a reply in about two days giving you instructions on returning the camera. Once they receive it, it will take about ten days to get back to you. By the time all of this is done, you have lost almost 30 days of use.I have been searching the web to only find out now that this seems to an all too common problem not only with this model but with other Canon digital cameras as well."
4,Good camera-but look at two major issues,"Okay people you know this camera is good. You have read all of previous reviews and they are true. But here is two major issues which won't bother people making 4 by 6 pictures from this camera. sharpness-not good, but you can tweak it in photoshop. Noise-common Canon noise is the same as it was in two year old camera. It seems that Canon promo department understood that general public don't care about sharpness or noise. People apparently likes their picture saturated and alive with color-which this camera deliver. However despite all of mentioned shortcomings I like this little camera because it has ""face recognition"" and it is so small. I litteraly have it on me all the time."
5,Another great little Canon,"This is my 3rd Canon Digital Elph camera. They are great little point and shoot cameras. The metal case makes them feel ""substantial"" not cheap and I have had great luck and great results with all of my Canons. This one is the smallest one so far, it doesn't need to get any smaller and they changed the position of some of the buttons, etc., making the camera easier to use. I would definitely recommend this camera and will probably replace it with another when I need to."
4,Canon SD1000 Digital Camera,I bought this camera for my Grandson and he is enjoying it along with all the features.
4,excellent,"it's small and light. When you read the handbook carefully, you'll find it can work very well in different circumstances. I'm particularly satisfied with it's video function which can produce very clear pictures."
2,Must have been a bad one....,"The SD1000's gone back. Lack of sharpness in the pictures--and it's a 7M camera..I noticed it when I started playing around with it. There's a fairly-complex group of settings, so I thought the problem might be there.However, after getting things set right, and the picture set for its highest resolution (3072x2304,) I tried a comparison test with my Oly C5050Z. That's a 5M camera, and the best JPG resolution I use is 2560x1920.Subject was some books on a shelf, using the flash. My Oly was marginally better. So the SD1000's been returned (Amazon does make it easy,) and the search has begun anew...."
5,Perfect,Truly an amazing little camera. I was looking for something small that I could stick in my pocket when I go out everyday but still took sharp pictures. This camera does all of that and more. Its small and solid and still manages to take gorgeous photos and very nice videos. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a easy to use and very portable camera.
1,very disappointed,i bought this canon based on the 5* reviews. i was totally disappointed in the quality of the photos. the shadows on outdoor photos were very harsh and when i tried to adjust them with the canon image editing program they still were very poor. i returned the camera extremely disappointed. it couldn't compare to my nikon 3 mp camera which is a few years old
5,love it!,"This camera is awesome!! I've had other canon's before, and have always been very pleased. The size of this one makes it perfect. I've opted for larger cameras that had long battery life, but this one is holding up great!! I am extremely content with picture quality and ease of use. No cons that I can see."
5,"Great price, service, and camera","Best price I found.Amazon is simply the best in service, follow up and I would be crazy to shop at any other site!Camera is the best in our family, the rest of us have Sony and this Canon powershotSD1000 out performs, we could not be more happy with what we got for the money.Thanks"
1,the dreaded E18 message,"Thinking about buying a Canon digital camera? Before you do, Google ""Canon Powershot E18"". Canon (and their customers) have been struggling for years to solve lens sticking issues that result in the dreaded E18 <error> message and an unusable camera. Canon is in denial about it and people who have purchased Canon cameras are furious. Believe me, I am sitting here right now with a Canon Powershot SD450 with a stuck open lens and nothing I can do about it."
1,1 star is too good,This thing takes the most distorted pictures I've ever seen. I am no photographer but these pictures are just bad. I am going to try to return it and buy something better. There isn't any image stabilization so any subject has to be absolutely still. The zoom is a joke. I wish I returned it sooner.
3,Canon PowerShot SD1000 review,The so called red eye detection dosent seem to work sometimes. The images are not soo great compared to the sony W55 model.
3,Agree - pics blurry,"I just got my camera last week. I quickly printed some shots that turned out to be surprisingly (unpleasantly) ""soft"" the way a previous reviewer noted. I have not adjusted many of the settings yet, but I expected the camera to give clearer shots regardless of the settings. Could this be a fluke with this particular camera or is it a problem with the entire SD1000 line? I know folks who swear by Canons. I will be checking with the company on this, and, if necessary, exchange the camera."
2,Annoying purple vertical bar in LCD,"I ordered this camera for its small size and simple look. Once I received it, however I noticed that when the lens is facing the light, very noticeable purple vertical bars appear in the LCD. It does not show up in the photo though (processed out). The troubleshooting section of the manual says this is normal. I went to a camera store and tried their demo. It had the same problem. I found it unberable and returned it. I am very disappointed that instead of fixing a known issue before releasing the product, Canon simple tells customers it's normal and ask them to get used to it."
4,Great Camera NO MESS NO FUSS,"THIS THING IS SUPER USER FRIENDLY AND IF YOU'VE OWNED A CANON BEFORE LIKE I HAVE GETTING AROUND THIS CAMERA IS EASY. THE ONLY THING THAT DID SUCK WAS THE MEMORY CARD, IT CAN HOLD NO MORE THAN 12 OR 13 PICS SO YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE RIGHT OFF THE BAT, BUT I GOT A GOOD DEAL SO IT ALL EVENS OUT."
5,The perfect choice,"I chose this camera after much research on the internet (Amazon & professional review sites) and being as I am not a professional photographer many of the comments really didnt apply to me. I needed a camera that WORKS, right out of the box, that doesnt require the user to have a PHD in photography (if there is such a thing) to understand the manual and will give me great shots of my kids, my pets, my days at the beach, my life!! Well I believe I've found it.The camera looks great, performs & responds well and does just what I need it to which is take great pictures with easy transfer to my PC. Both Basic & Advanced Manuals are included in the box, along with cables and a 32mb card.If you were like me on the never ending & ever more confusing search for ""the perfect camera"" take my advice & just click ""add to cart"" - I'm sure you wont regret it."
5,espectacular camara,"I love the camara it was like brand new, Im very happy to have gotten it from you, it is great prices."
2,Blurry indoor photos,This camera produces inferior photos compared to 4 year old Canon S410.Outdoor photos are excellent but indoor photos are bad.Try a bunch of Indoor photos with Zoom level set toMax and you will see high noise levels. I would recommendthe S850 instead.
1,Watch out - warranty not worth the paper its written on,"Camera was three months old when I turned it on one day and the screen no longer worked - it was mostly white with a few thin colorful lines. Sent it to Canon and they responded that the repair cost was $90 (for a $160 camera) because the there was ""pressure impact"" to the LCD. This camera was not dropped nor did anything fall on it (or pressure it). There were no outward signs of damage. When I called the service department, they wouldn't consider that it could have been a defective unit. There are several other customer reviews at Amazon where the same thing happened, one just two weeks after purchase. So if the unit is not defective, it is a good buy; if it is defective, Canon will be happy to have you buy the camera a 2nd time."
5,Coolest yet!,This camera is the coolest yet! It is so compact...it fits in the palm of your hand yet it does pretty much anything you desire in a camera. The pictures are sharp and it records video great.
2,Not the best.,I am very disappointed that this camera doesn't have cropping features.I had a Sony before and I was able to trim my pictures and printed.Everybody were impressed how I was able to get close things when I took the pictures.I think that's something that all cameras should have. None of the Canon cameras have this feature.Better go with a Kodak or a Sony.
1,Design Flaw,"If you are thinking of buying this camera, don't. I've had it a year and keep getting ""lens error restart camera"" where the thing jams up. All you need to do is a google search to read all the negatives comments from owners.Disappointing"
3,Canon sd1000,"it was easy to read the directions, charge the battery, add a memory card to it ... I haven't really used it yet but am sure I'm going to be totally happy with it."
3,It was working all right but suddenly the screen stopped working,"It is a good product, I was very happy until it stopped working, I need to check my guaranty"
4,Just lo que necesito al precio justo,"Tamaño perfecto, pila con buena duracion, buen precio yyyyyyy lo mejor de todo muy buenas fotos."
2,Not pleased,"I had the Canon SD500 previously but we dropped it and it broke. Opted for this one since I someone told me it was a good camera. I am not pleased with it, pictures come out badly and overall a pretty useless camera. Our SD 500 was far better."
2,breaks every time,this camera is okay except it has that common problem of breaking not too long after you buy it and leaves you with no other solution but to buy another camera NOT made by Canon.
4,Scuffs easily,If you want a small compact digital camera with lots of features this is a good one to have. You should buy a case for it though since it scuffs just buy carrying it around in your pocket.
3,Overrated,"Another overrated canon.This one is too small and delicate and picture quality is nowhere comparable to the classic powereshots of early 2000s like s330, though many times the megapixel.Proved me a point that 2 mp can be better than this 7mp canon and for all those with older cameras, upgrading to a more mp newer camera is not the way to go.Rather the way to go for upgraders is to buy a dslr and continue using your trusted old digital camera for times when you are not carrying th e dslr."
1,Canon would not stand behind their product,"I purchased this camera based on the positive reviews. After minimal use the lens cover became stuck. I examined it carefully for damage (none noted, not surprising given the camera was kept in the box most of the time) and packed it carefully and sent to Canon for warranty repair. They claimed I damaged the camera and refused to honor the warranty. I strongly believe Canon did not deal with me in good faith. I will not purchase Canon products in the future."
5,Great camera,"I love this camera. Can't say enough. Easy to use, great pics, small. Its everything I was looking for."
3,Mostly a great camera,I bought this a few months ago and it is a great little camera except for one thing. A lot of times when I go somewhere and need to take pix the battery seems to die. It might just be my ignorance why I never notice when the battery will die but so far I can't tell if there is an indicator or not. Maybe I need an extra battery or something but my old camera used energizer lithiums and it indicated when the battery was losing power. This camera just waits to the last minute to tell you need a charged battery which is kind of hard at an amusement park. Other than that I have no other complaints!
5,Very satisfied!!,"I love this camera. It is small and compact enough to carry without a lot of weight. I have experimented with a lot of different lights and distances. It does not take the place of my Pentax long distance lenses, but for the price and size it does a surprisingly great job. I love the true colors it captures and the various quality settings. I have not been disappointed with the quality of pictures."
4,Great LITTLE camera!,I have had this Cannon for about 2 months now and so far so good... I only purchased it to take on short tips so i could carry it easily in my front pocket and it is perfect! I have noticed no short comings in the camera and for what I use a point and shot camera for it is exactly what i thought i was getting. Great little camera for this price!
3,"Good product, poor service","The camera is good, but they charged me more the the street price. Also it was a gift and the price was displayed on it. I will deal with them in the future, but only if their price is conpetitive and mailed directly t6o me if it's a gift"
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome","Great Camera!! My uncle that 110% believed in his Sony T series, bought him self and his daughter one of these! They are easy to work, and take really nice photos"
5,AWSOME CAMERA,"THIS CAMERA IS AWSOME. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CAMERAS AND YET I HAVE BEEN TAKING SOME AWSOME PICTURES AND IS MAKING ME MONEY ON EBAY. *************FRANK FERNICOLA, EAST HAVEN, CT."
4,Canon SD1000,Working good so far.Compact.Good quality.Face deduction is not working some time.Zoom button is very small. Hard to zoom.Overall the product is good for the price.
5,"Great Camera for Size, Quality and Price","This camera is fantastic for those people who want to capture memories without spending a lot of money or lugging around a bulky camera bag. This fits perfectly into a moderate sized bag (or a larger one if you carry more than you need, like me).The picture quality is great, especially for such a compact camera. I am not looking to take professional photos but I can appreciate the crisp resolution that's not so refined my pores show in my pictures.I also purchased the leather carrying case for it, which I find easier to get the camera out than the zipper bags. You never know when one of those 'I need to have proof of this' moments will sneak up on you."
4,Great Little Camera,So small yet so powerful. This camera has excellent features in such a small package. Well worth the money!
4,Claiming Knowledge,"The present study is not intended as a catalogue of the opinions of the various Esoteric positions. To discuss general or theoretical aspects of the Modern Esoteric Tradition without entering into the empirical specifics leaves the reader in a fog of abstractions; referring exhaustively to a vast corpus of source texts entails the risk of constructing a under-theorized descriptive study. In order to strike a balance between the descriptive and analytic goals of this study, the author resorted to using case studies from the consulted sources as exemplars. These particular cases are subjected to a symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that uses empirical data to highlight a broader point. Although the narrow focus and the chosen approach are, as in any other case, a compromise, at least it has the double advantage of extendability and falsifiability."
3,A good product but not clomplete information about it,"I bougth this scanner because of a good brand and a good price, but my surpprice was when I did open the box. ONLY the scanner was on it. Nor the charger or base. I have had to buy the charger base. Amazon does not show info about the charger/base and neither tells that you have to buy them."
3,The Painter's Secret Geometry,"I had three copies of the ""Painter's Secret Geometry"" by Charles Bouleau by both publishers. What seems to behove me is that the 19th century painters used the pyramid or triangle in composing their works. Yes I do agree with the book that other means were used but artists did not rely just on those given within the book even the author mentions that we should not depend upon them for composing. I think that all artists should study the various compositions and take what they should and depart from that...that is be original and creative. A view finder will suffice and is very simple and cheap! You can create you own."
3,well,for some reason the people i sell to really like these boosters not sure if thats because of the cards or because theyre relitively cheap but overall yes the shipping is expencive its nowhere near two pounds but thats why you should look around before buying anything. well good luck to you all .
1,product no longer exists,"As other reviewers have indicated, this product no longer exists. My university library has had it on order for over five years. A mystery why it remains listed on sale"
1,WHERE IS BITTER RIICE?,"Like the others, I ordered this film months ago. It has not arrived. Every few weeks, Amazon notes that there has been a further delay. If the film is not available, why is Amazon advertising this item?"
4,Good start,I found myself between the other reviewers. I did not find the pace to be too fast or too slow. I wanted to learn conversational German for a trip. This is a good start. It gives you a starting vocab and basic numbers etc. I still need a phrase book but at least I have some phrases that I know and can use. Overall a steal at this price.
5,don't believe the hype,"i know for a fact that not every one of the george's have ""real hair"" they only made a few thousand of them, and they are hard to find. if you find one with real hair.consider yourself lucky"
1,disappointing sound quality,"Everybody knows Rubinstein is the best. So I was enormously disappointed to pop the CD in and hear horrible background scratchiness. Surely in this technological age, this can be avoided. I'm returning the CD and wondering how to get one that sounds good."
3,Some good advice but not much substance,I don't know what I was expecting but I was a bit disappointed. I have another book by Radin (Recruiter's Almanac) that is very helpful. This cd set has some good suggestions if you are opening your own firm but not so much if you are currently working for someone else. He touches on a lot of topics but doesn't go deep. Maybe if you've only been a recruiter for one or two years in a small firm it could be educational.
1,Very disappointed,"The sound quality is not good, especially of the violin.It's the worst RCA album I ever bought.Maybe because it's an EMI bounus CD."
4,"Good clock, ok radio","Pros:- The time on the clock is easy to set and use.- The clock is easy to see with the bright time option.- The alarm can actually go off even if the batteries are dead. However, this only works with battery power.- Very durable. Dropped it from a bunk-bed about 10 times, and still no defects.- Nap setting is a great future of the alarm clock.Cons:- The alarm sound is kind of quiet and inconsistent. Both two alarms are quite quiet, and are just small beeps that are 1 1/2 seconds apart.- The radio quality is poor. It's hard to get even some local stations to work correctly.- The speaker is very poor. The sound on the radio disorts a lot.BOTTOMLINE: If you're looking for a cheap yet durable alarm clock with a radio you're not gonna use often, this one is a perfect pick. If you're expecting a lot from the radio, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, great alarm clock!"
3,Cheaper with Age,"We had the virtually identical Emerson clock bought at Target about 4 to 5 years ago. That one worked well. So we had to replace it after it was dropped several times and the radio stopped working. This time we bought two so his/her alarms would match in the bedroom. We got this Emerson from Amazon because it looked the same. The only ""outside difference"" compared to the older Target one was this new one is a little deeper and wider. But ""inside"" (where it counts) there is a big difference. The alarm switches are hard to operate and you cannot tell where they are set due to sloppy workmanship. The radio reception is OK to poor. A lot of static. We sent one back and kept one (reluctantly) so we have some matching in the BR. Would not buy again."
1,It Beeps at odd times,"This is certainly a nicely styled clock radio. The large numerals are just great, and the dual alarms, if they worked, would be great. I could not get the alarms to work unless both were set to the same time. Also, it would do its beeping thing at odd hours when neither of the alarms were set. The radio is only so so, the sound certainly is not great and the tuning is difficult."
2,Unreliable alarm,"Emerson CK5250 Dual Alarm Clock Radio (Silver)Well, I love the look and the huge numbers but the alarm is hopeless. It goes off at random times of the day (and night) even when the alarm switch is set to OFF! I had it in a spare bedroom so I ignored this for quite some time. Sometimes it sets off the alarm beep sound. Sometimes it sets off the radio. The time it goes off has nothing to do with either of the times set on the alarm settings (or whether the alarm is set to play or not). I contact Emerson radio and they agreed to replace it for me (even though it was technically out of warranty) however by the time I pay for shipping (and their additional request of $5 to ship it back) I would have paid for this clock all over again. So I opted not to return it. [...]."
5,Great Pocket Size Guide,"Gives a decent treatment of all the necessary topics and is a handy shop/small form factor reference guide. Not all encompassing by any means, but that's what the rest of your A&P library is for. Some of the charts and diagrams are small/dated, but 90% plus of the information is there (if you squint hard enough). If you can't read the charts, you can always use your google machine to look up and print out a large print edition to hang on the wall."
4,"Dry, but helpful.","This book is a good, concise source of a lot of information in a small package. Certainly better than trying to carry AC 43.13 in your pocket."
4,good product,"This product is great for our particular need. It looks and functions well. The hinges and drawer glides are already in place which makes assembly much easier. Parts are well marked and the fit is good.The supplier was very prompt in shipment and it arrived in good condition. Was missing the hardware for the bottom drawer, but supplier immediately shipped the missing package and resolved the issue.The product improvements that I would suggest is a caster on the bar support leg to make moving unit easier and, although they look good, the back and sides could more closely match the front wood grains and strength.If someone has a need for this type product, I would recommend they review this one."
4,GREAT TABLE,I LOVE MY TABLE ITS THE BEST AND LOOKS GREAT IN MY KITCHEN.WAS VERY EASY TO ASSMBLE AND THE ADDED BREAKFEST BAR IS ALSO VERY NICE
1,Poor Quality construction,"Every thing went great with the construction of this product until we tried to put the top on. The holes for the cams were in the wrong place, so we pulled the cams out and put the top on anyway as a temporary measure. There is no way to contact the manufacturer directly so we are posting this review in hopes of hearing from them.We could return the whole product, but we cannot figure how to get all the pieces back into the original shipping container. It also weighs a lot (too much for us to lift) so getting it to UPS is too difficult to do. We'd just like to get a new top."
4,Good value for the price,"Shipping was quick, nothing was missing and there was no damage to any parts. Assembly instructions were easy to follow. I made some changes to the cart: replaced castors with feet, sanded and painted all parts prior to assemply to match my kitchen cabinets and eliminated the towel and utensil racks on the ends. The drawer facings were misaligned and it was necessary to redrill the holes for the facings. The alignment of the doors aren't perfect and one is slightly warped. All things considered though, I'm satisfied with the end result and feel that it was a good value for the price I paid. It looks comparable to the carts costing 50% more."
2,Less than happy,"Like many others I had missing parts. The screws to the drawers were missing. Then I could only get one drawer to fit correctly after I received the screws. I glued the drawer front on the left side to the cart and did away with the drawer completely. Assembly was easy but frustrating, the parts did not fit together very well especially on the interior. The drilled holes had wood chips in them and these cam fastener are devises that are supplied on very cheap furniture. While the cart looks good on the outside the interior is far less impressive. The support was good. I was not put on hold and the woman who answered was very helpful. In fact, the customer support woman is the only reason that allowed me to give this cart a two star rating. Reading other reviews it would seem that quality control is hit or miss with this company. With the cart I received it was a big miss!!"
4,Nice if you have the room,"We are really happy with this unit. We have a large kitchen but not enough storage or surface / counter space. I had a small problem with one of the wheels. when I brought it to their attention they immediately sent me a repalcement wheel. Although it was an inconvenience, I must say they had very responsive excellent customer service. This is nice for a breakfast bar at a very reasonable price. Other then the 1 wheel issue, we are really happy with the unit."
5,Love It!,"Item arrived very quickly, ordered on Saturday and I received it on Thursday! This cart was packaged carefully by the Mfg. and arrived in perfect condition. All of the pieces were in the box and was assembled quickly and easily by my 12-year old son. I love it! It is a beautiful piece and very roomy. One drawback was that I did not like the knife block...it does not have individual slots for knives...so I left it off!"
1,Didn't work out for me,"The shipping was very speedy but I found two major parts were badly broken when I opened the box to begin the assembly. And I was told that it would take 3 - 7 business days before replacement parts could be shipped to me. I was also overwhelmed by the complexity of the project - it has 36 individual wood pieces plus about 100 pieces of hardware! I decided that between the broken parts, the long shipping time for the replacement parts, and the complexity of assembly that it was not worth it and I returned it."
4,A Note on Dimensions,"Looks like a good product, I do not own it. But I think the height and width dimension are mixed up.I think it is 54"" Wide, and 36"" High."
3,it is ok if you are a woodworker,Very poor quality control...missing holes and badly aligned holes. IKEA it is not. On the plus side the wood is pretty. But you will need very sharp drill bit and variable speed reversible drill AND a good steady arm. Some phases require 2 people. Took us 6 hours including trip to hardware store.
5,Great Product at a Great Price,Cheaper than the Apple charger and smaller too. Great when I'm traveling.
2,obsolete,"It was a waste of my money. There are so many modern books... This one should only remain in a Hebrew public library (if at all) as a document of it's time, when that was the standard of Hebrew texts."
3,Nice but not great,"Bought a size large. Like the color. Had to wash several times to get the smell of formalide out. Which is used to keep away little critters during shipping. I am 5'9"" tall & weight 180#. The robe fits well over clothes which is how I frequently wear then to stay warm.The feel is not nearly as nice as some of our good Egyptian cotton towels. The biggest disappointment was the robe shrank 6"" in length. It was washed twice in the warm/cold setting and then dried on low.My 3 star rating is due to the excessive shrinking in the length."
3,Towells,"Good product but overpriced, go to your local auto paint shop and buy them by the bag at about 1/10 the price!"
4,A terrific independent movie that makes you think...,"I caught this movie back in 2005 when it was shown at the SXSW festival and even after all these years, it still stands out firmly in my mind. There aren't too many movies that do that for me. The writing is incredible, the acting is never dull and the soundtrack is just haunting. I am glad that this movie finally found its way onto DVD so that more people can experience it."
5,Such a treasure!,"This book means so much to me. It has changed my outlook on life, and has given me a lot of comfort. I was raised Baptist and maintain a lot of the Christian values. Mahayana Buddhist values fit quite nicely. I have found a new kind of happiness and learned, or at least I try, to appreciate every experience in my life, whether it is painful or not. I know this sounds cliche, but this book has changed my life, and I think anyone with an open mind will find comfort from the verses within this text."
5,Feel like I need the written copy,"I got this after listening to Pema Chodron's Don't Bite the Hook. I drive to work an hour daily so I listen a lot. However, I want the written copy so I can mark spots now that I have jeard it. Really wouldn't have understood this without the background of a teacher (like Pema)."
2,No disks!,"While I thought that the book's premise sounded promising, the content was elementary. Without the sample files to work on, the lessons are difficult to follow. The lessons also reminded me of the Pro/E training manuals I used years ago."
2,Needs the disketts!,"The good news is that this looks like an interesting and worthwhile books. The bad news is that it immediately refers to the ""companion disketts"" with ""seed drawings"" to help you along in the exercises. THESE DISKETTS ARE NOT PROVIDED, and it doesn't mention where to send for them, or download them! This book would be much better with the disketts."
2,Garrett's gone soft,"I've enjoyed every other Garrett book, gleefully accepting them for what they are: light, low brain power required, reading. Nickel Idols left me very disappointed. Too much Dead Man, not enough Garrett. And what's worse, what Garrett there is has gone way too soft. My advice is to skip this one, and hope Glen gets his edge back in the next one."
3,More Wonderful Garrett,"I love this series. I felt this episode was not quite the same as the previous ones. Some of the spice and details that make the series so interesting seemed to be missing. I think it could easily have used more ""padding"" and made into two volumes. I will continue to purchase any and all because Cook is one of the most interesting writers currently publishing.I love TunFaire and the wonderful creatures inhabiting it."
1,Utterly Ridiculous,"After reading 90 pages, I still had no idea what the story was about. The book went into the trash."
3,"good--as far as it goes, that is...","This pill cutter by Duro-Med is a mixed bag. While it splits smaller circular pills very well; it doesn't do quite as good a job on larger, rectangular shaped ""horse pills"" or very large pills. I am really sorry to read that other reviewers had trouble with this pill cutter; but I can understand why.I use this primarily for cutting smaller, rounded pills in half. For this purpose, this pill cutter is bound to do a very good job. On the other hand, large pills may be cumbersome to fit into that tiny wedge before you press down on the plastic top to cut the pill into two haves.On the bright side, the plastic is well constructed and this pill cutter has lasted me a good while.If you want a high quality pill splitter or a pill crusher, you will need to look elsewhere. I admit that this pill cutter is an entry level type of device."
1,Pill Cutters In General,"I am writing about pill cutters in general-not about any one particular model or style.For those of you who like them please carry on. For those who don't like them or who can't find one they are comfortable with here is a bit of advice..whether you are human or a human with a pet....I have a small dog who has allergies so I have to cut her allergy medicine into quarters...was having an awful time with a knife or sheet rock cutter or whatever..nothing seemed to work without crushing the pill therefore wasting a lot....soooo one day I decided to try her nail clippers to cut the pills...well, to my amazement it worked wonderfully! Most pet owners have nail clippers right! Now there is a dual purpose--nail clipper & pill cutter. I use the guillotine type..make sure the blade is sharp & cut those pills with ease and no more pills bouncing off the walls!!!"
2,Pill cuttter,Tends to crush the pill rather than cut it. Then it is hard to remove the pill as it becomes embedded in the mechanism.Pill Cutter
1,Off-Center Cutter,"Don't bother buying this pill cutter if you want to cut the pill in equal parts. The blade on the cutter is off-center, so when you cut the pill you get pieces that are about one-third and two-thirds. Definitely not useful and it is going in the trash since it is not worth sending back to Amazon for a refund. If you need a pill cutter, look at Drugstore.com and they have one for about $4 that is properly aligned and will cut your pills in equal pieces. The Drugstore.com pill cutter has a guide in the center that the blade has to fit through to work, so you know it is always aligned properly. The Amazon pill cutter does not and is just a blade with no guide. I have to cut a pill into eight pieces for my cat, so I can attest to the pill cutter on Drugstore.com working as it should."
3,Pill Cutter as simple as it comes,A very disappointing and simple plastic pill cutter.There is nothing there except a blade and a triangular shape that is supposed to hold the pill (it doesn't).It seems to cut round pills reasonably but other shapes slide and aren't held in place.Using a simple razor blade will do a better job.
1,About as interesting as filing taxes,"The author seems to have a lot in common with Dan Barker, an atheist I briefly met a few years ago during a visit to the University of Wisconsin--Stevens Point. Mr. Barker didn't make much of an impression on me then (although I did get a free copy of his book), and Andrew Bushard didn't make much of an impression on me with his own attempt at a book here. You might actually be better off flipping on the tube and watching QVC for a while--even if you bought an overpriced set of patio chairs you still wouldn't be gettting nearly as ripped off as you would from the ideas in this book."
1,Justice?,"This was merely a juvenille example of bankrupt vilification pertaining to the Dutch class struggle, as well as post-modernity under the guise of nihilistic expressionism. Mr. Andrew Bushard clearly seems to be confused about his Nordic impulses."
3,"Heady book, tough to read","The book seems interesting, but Kurzweil isn't engaging if your a non-fanatic. Sadly it sits on my bookshelf only partially read."
5,stunning,"I have at times computed in my head moores law out into the future.I {and I suspect many others}have tried to wrap my mind around what the effect that this massive computing power would exercise on all fields of science.Ray Kurzweil fills in with exquisite detail what those effects would be.If he is wrong in certain details{as all futurists inevitably are}his projections are based on mathmatical constants,broad scientific knowledge and concepts that that project into the future in a way that I suspect will be upheld and marvelled at in the same way as moores ""law"" is today."
3,Fascinating but overlong,"I had two feelings reading this book: astonishment and boredom, and the latter increased exponentially.Thankfully, in the future, Kurzweil's consciousness will be uploaded onto a non-biological substrate and thereby greatly enhanced and he will no longer repeat himself interminably.I want to stress that his ideas are absolutely breathtaking, but not even breathtaking ideas can bear up under endless repetition.A 652 page beast that could have been knocked off in 300 pages if Kurzweil had deleted every paragraph beginning ""As I stated in chapter...""Let's hope our transhuman AI overlords know the meaning of the phrase: ""Poetic economy of detail"".5 stars for his stimulating thesis, 1 for his delivery. I give it a 3."
3,Not so useful,"THere are many research papers published on the computational capability of the biological brain, which is considered to be superior to conventional silicon processors, the mechanism of which was not fully explained from the conventional physics. I hoped that this book gave us a key (or hint) to clarify the problem, but I could not be fully satisfied contrary to my expectation and its large volume."
2,Not Quite,"A new hope to escape our human reality. With high tech parts we will evolve into something new and better. The author argues that the combination of computers, bioengineering, etc. will all come together to produce a super humanity. I've heard these arguments and hopes before from: Religions, political despots, and other desperate groups of people."
3,The downside of buying from Amazon,"The book arrived with the front cover bent back and creased in half. No way I would have picked up a copy like that in a local bookstore.I love the convenience of Amazon, I just wish things like this didn't happen. Really disappointed with this particular order."
2,Much hype - litle to show,Much hype - litle to show. If interested in this subject get it at your library.
3,Overwrought,This is a book of sparkling ideas poorly related. There is a lot of repetition and padding. Feel free to skim.
1,Don't get the Kindle edition!,"Do not bother reading The Singularity Is Near (Feb 1, 2007 edition) on the Kindle.The book contains many graphs which are barely or not at all readable on the Kindle 2. (This may be better on the DX.) There are references to page numbers in the text which are entirely meaningless on the Kindle. There are misformatted numbers: ten to the minus n is not the same as ten to the n. But most importantly, about 40% of the volume of the book are notes. These appear as endnotes on the Kindle but they are NOT LINKED from the main text. You just get a number in superscript. The table of contents has a single entry point ""Notes"", not even separate ones for each chapter. You have to page through all the way. This makes it virtually impossible to look up the notes from the main text. Again, the notes are a major portion of the whole book.The whole thing can serve as an example how NOT to prepare an e-book edition."
5,Get up to scratch with Kurtzweil!,"With a Sagan-like ability to communicate complex technologies and scientific problems, Ray Kurtzweil brings us into the not-too-distant future. Exciting, challenging, and like all new things - scary."
1,Horse Poop,"Boring read, Mr. Kurzweil does a very good job at providing long inventory lists of technologies and theories and lots of other stuff, butt does not really provide any true substance to his predictions. I would say that Mr. Kurzweil has been a very successful con-man for about the last 50 years. If you really research his claims throughout his life, he has always been playing on the ignorance of the masses and provides just enough science fact to convince most people that he knows something significant about the future. He is a very good flim flam man."
1,Kurzweil's at it again (one-trick pony),"In 1992, which is (ahem) EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO, Kurzweil published ""The Age of Intelligent Machines.""In 2001, he published ""The Age of Spiritual Machines.""In 2005, he published ""The Singularity is Near.""In all those years (decades) I have not seen ANY progress made in the domain of ""intelligent machines."" (I'm still running Windows, and Mac freaks are still bragging about their Macs. :-) )(And, no, I do not count machines which can ""sort of"" take dictation, with no understanding of language, ""intelligent."")This guy reminds me of Paul Ehrlich, who made a fine living predicting the end of the world from overpopulation over the same period of time. I think he did 3 or 4 books as well, all of them totally wrong.Wake me when computers are sentient, and can speak a natural language. Or, to put it simply, wake me when I can put a human child in front of a ""machine"" and ask the machine ""Is this a boy or a girl?"" and get the right answer."
3,487 pages + a good editor = 225 pages,"It's a potentially important book as many other reviewers have pointed out but his stream of consciousness writing style gets aggravating. If you can skim, you win. If you read, you bleed. There aren't many things he says fewer than four times. But some of those things have come true, some will and some of the amazing ones may. He has an impressive track record. Now if he'd just add discipline to his writing."
3,Not for non geeks!,"Although the reading is tedious for someone who is not that scientifically or computer oriented, the concepts and ideas the book presents are fascinating and a bit scary!"
5,Only for those with an open mind,This book will shake you to your very foundations. Only a few decades and non - biological intelligence with surpass human intelligence. The arguements are clear and concise.
1,Moores Law is not universally applicable,"For the few examples of exponential growth, most notably Moore's Law, there are 10 (battery life, transportation speed, food production per acre, life span, etc) of areas that we have devoted a great deal of effort towards improving without exponential returns.While this book presents some interesting points it is little more than psuedo science. Perhaps Kurzweil's most important conclusion, that we are nothing more than biological computers, is the most scary. The conclusion of this, that he does not raise, is that there is no free will. Maybe he is correct, I doubt it though."
5,Body encoder,"""Ray Kurzweil HIV=scanned the apocalypse brain universe of a drug fetus with the era respiration-byte."" - Kenji Siratori, author of Blood Electric"
1,uninteresting,"really not impressed, it's a collection of items and examples that don't necessarily fit together.The style seems somehow childish...I personally am disapointed..."
2,And So's the Apocalypse,"While its thesis -- that computers will soon overtake and subsume us -- is arresting and provocative, this lengthy meditation on the logic of Moore's Law is clumsy, repetitive and extremely poorly written: essentially a magazine article that's been padded with graphs (and an assortment of academic debris) to fill a largely unreadable five hundred pages.The whole idea's kinda cool, but, wow, the presentation blows."
3,Zelazny's Lord of Light: A Potential Kurzweil Outcome?,"(This is not a review, just a comment, so please ignore the ""stars"".)I've not read any of Ray Kurzweil's books, but I'm now intrigued after having just heard his interview with Ira Flatow on NPR's Science Friday. Listening, I was immediately reminded of Roger Zelazny's excellent 60's novel ""Lord of Light"" in which, using Kurzweil's terminology, the ""singularity"" has occurred and technology has allowed the elite to repeatedly reincarnate and control the masses. I just hope Kurweil's predictions aren't realized in that manner."
4,Singularly Unique Work,"Started book in Summer 2006..and finished in Winter 2008...took a while to complete the marathon read. Well worth investment of time though my recollection of details is slim.The author makes numerous predictions, specifically computer intelligence surpassing all of human intelligence in the 21st C. It will be a project to follow up on which predictions materialize and when. Useful acronyms from the book: MNT - molecular nanotechnology; GNR - genetics, nanotech and robotics."
5,Wonderful Book,"I just love it. Since I saw a few months ago that youtube video of Ray Kurtzwail of the ""I've got a Secret"" 1965 TV Show, I wanted to read some more about what he says. And now I can see that he is so good explaining and reasoning with true references all his conclusions, that I am really excited about what is coming. This book is a 'must read' for anybody who likes technology and wonders where it can takes us, as well as any person who is curious about what will come at the current trend."
3,Good read but hard work.,Very well researched and structured book. Great topic with everything covered in a very thorough way with lots of supporting scientific evidence for conclusions given. Be wary if you can't handle LOTS of detail.
5,Every human should read this book,"I never really took his arguments as more than 'interesting' until I actually read his book. The guy is a truly far thinking genius. Sure a lot of his arguments about computing densities are really out there. Not sure I agree with everything or maybe I just don't get them. But one point is hard to argue with: evolutionary and human technologies advance exponentially. The guy could be several orders of magnitude off, and we will still be an outlandishly advanced civilization in 200-300 years."
5,"Wonderful, deeply considered and compelling.","This is not a 'light read' on the subject of how humans will become fully interfaced with machines, as the next phase in human evolution. It is, however, extremely well considered.As reader you don't need to agree with everything but it will certainly open your eyes to how humans have used technology (from fire onwards) to increase longevity and improve wellbeing. The book considers that as we move toward a point where speed of change becomes so fast our only choice is to merge with machines to increase our computing power beyond our brains, we will see a leap in what it means to be human.This will certainly open your eyes. And it was written in 2005 with reasonably accurate descriptions of how the world would be right now."
4,Good book that is overpriced.,"I really enjoyed this book. It brings up a lot of interesting data to generally point us where technology (specifically computers) is heading in the near future, and to dream a little about the possible applications.That having been said the information is dated now and this book should not be sold for this much on kindle. What a shame since the average person would benefit from its content but probably isn't willing to shell out nearly $20 for the digital version.Good book, very overpriced for a digital version."
3,"Interesting, but repetitive","The book contains a lot of interesting background and data, but also can drown the reader in a sea of hand-waving. I understood after the 100th mention that the author believes soon our bodies will be inhabited with billions of nanobots that run around and fix all our problems, so there is no need to keep bringing it up every sentence for a hundred pages! It appears that whenever it isn't clear how a problem will be solved (software AI), then the book reverts to the standby: nanobots will figure it all out, don't worry.I have enjoyed the book so far (half way through). The first hundred or so pages went by quickly because they contained a lot of interesting discussion, facts, and figures. But then I entered the 'nanobots forever' section and sometimes I can't read more then a few pages at a sitting because I get tired of reading how nanobots will do this, nanobots will do that. The author's world is full of magic, just that magic has been renamed to 'nanobot'."
2,Editor please !!!!,"I agree with some of the other reviewers... get an editor. If the author had one, he should get a new one. Very thought-provoking ideas are buried in highly repetitive paragraphs and chapters. I can only assume that most of the readers of this book don't need to read things twenty times before they take hold. I feel like the singularity is approaching, but we just collectively pushed it back a little bit by plodding through this bloated volume."
1,Kindle price is a rip off,"This review is for the publisher pricing of this book for the Kindle. I can buy this book in paper from Amazon for under $14 and new from 3rd party sellers for under $12. To get it on Kindle it's 19.99. That's a total rip-off! I love my kindle but part of what made the Kindle work was that it brought more profits to the seller (no printing, transportation, stocking, etc.) while giving the reader a break on the price. Now that the Kindle is popular, publishers think they can ramp up their profits by charging more for the kindle version even though it costs them less to produce!!! (This is the second time in the last month I've seen a publisher set the kindle price higher than the paper price!!!) If this continues it will kill e-readers!"
4,Dear Penguin Publishing House,"I like the book, but I bought the Kindle version (which is five dollars more expensive than the print version!!!) only to discover that the digital images of the charts and graphs are completely illegible. That is outrageous! Ray gets four stars. Penguin, you get none. Please fix the digital images and stop price gouging your consumers! I am so mad at you right now that I will seriously think twice before buying one of your titles again!"
5,Perfect for Grilling,I use these when grilling. The are long and keep my hands away from the heat. The locking mechanism is handy and easy to use. I love Messermeister tongs!
1,Another Chinese Made Item...Ahhh.,"I was so disappointed when I saw the big-fat-Made-In-China sticker on the 12 inch Messermeister tongs that I just received through Amazon today. I am now debating as to whether or not I will keep or return them based on principle.If I wanted Chinese made tongs, I would have bought the $4 variety from Wal-Mart.I would have happily paid a few dollars more for an American or European made pair.I will pay closer attention next time."
2,VERY DISPLEASED!!!,THIS PRODUCT JUST DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO TRIM AROUND THE AREAS I PURCHASED IT FOR AND WHAT A TRIMMER IS FOR. I HAVE MINI-SCHNAUZHERS AND WANTED IT FOR THE EARS AND FEET. IT JUST DID NOT WORK WELL AT ALL FOR THE EARS AND SOMEWHAT BETTER FOR THE PADS OF THE FEET. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
3,Pump arrived broken,"The pump arrived broken because of packing it separately wrapped tightly around the bottle of hand scrub, broke the straw part. The product is great otherwise"
2,disappointed,"rubinstein has for some time been my favorite pianist. schubert's 960 has for some time been my favorite sonata, maybe even my favorite piano piece period. how could i go wrong? the problem, for me, is that rubinstein plays this sonata as if it were from the classical period. he plays it perfect, but it is too stiff and formal. too fast! i feel as if there is no emotion in this recording. of the impromptus, they are perfectly played, and sound as if they are effortless, as if rubinstein is floating over the keys. typical rubinstein. the problem is, that is not the rubinstein that played the sonata, and that's the only reason i bought the cd."
2,Very Predictable,"Okay premise for a story, but very predictable and written at a 4th grade level. Good for a vacation or dentist's office."
5,Page turner,"Great book. There isn't a lag in the story, it just keeps going till the end. A very good page turner. I will be reading more of Elizabeth Lowell's books."
2,storyteller,"The book started out slow. I know it takes time to establish a character because I'm an author myself. I actually felt more of a connection with the son, Lane. Parts were predictable. The behind the scenes look at the border and the way the U.S. and Mexico feed off each other is eye-opening. All in all I had a hard time keeping track of the characters because they didn't stick with me. Writing a book is hard work. Good luck to the author."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book! The characters were believable and easy to relate to. The plot moves at a good pace and you are quickly drawn into the underground world of drugs and narcotrafficantes. You can feel Grace's fear, strength, and struggles as she goes to lengths she never thought she would go to as a person and as a judge to save her son. She is forced to the other side of the law and to face her past - the best and worst with Joe Farrow. Excellent book!"
3,Swift start; long-drawn-out finish,"Grace Silva, a federal judge discovers that her son is essentially a hostage at his private school in Mexico. Her ex-husband Ted has stolen millions from very powerful drug traffickers in Tijuana and has disappeared. Grace tries to contact Joe Faroe and in turn recruits the services of St. Kilda Consulting. Her son's captors have given her two days to recover their money or they will kill him. Grace comes across as someone very nave for a federal judge. The supposed attraction between Joe and Grace feels forced and unnatural. Weak dialogue at times, especially at the end; and too many storyline threads create unnecessary length to the narrative. Overall this novel was adequate but did not live up to standards set by the author in previous works."
3,Lacked Intrigue,"This is the first Lowell book I have read. The plot was quite good, but I just didn't get that ""can't put this book down"" feeling while reading. That is, the book never had me up till early hours of the morning like some other books I have read. I kept waiting for something intriguing or exciting to happen, but it just took too long... and when it did, it was somewhat of an anti climax. The book was however well written and well researched.This was an average read."
1,very disappointing,"As a long time Lowell fan I had looked forward to a new release and not just a remake of an old book, but this book was not worth the wait.I found the characters shallow making it hard to relate or connect them within the plot. As for the plot, it wandered so I had a hard time remembering which side of the border the characters were on! I kept on reading hoping to see a glimpse of the Lowell found in the Donovan, Risk or Rarites series but that just didn't happen.Was this just another case of an author ""cranking out"" books to make the publishers bottom line regardless of whether the book is worth the paper it is printed on."
2,Not so great,"Lowell seems to be slipping into medicore charcters and bizarre story lines on a regular basis now. The characters in this one were just a little to off the mark for reality. Grace never totally freaks that her son was taken - not very mom-like. The Mexican drug running/people smugling/killers are hard to follow and just seem unbelievable. I have been a fan for years, but have stopped buying her books and shifted to just using the library because they no longer hold my attention and aren't very memerable anymore."
1,Disappointed Little Boy,This item is a joke. It's way too small for a twin bed in both width and length. My 5-year old is very disappointed. I wouldn't buy again and am trying to get my money back.
2,Decent but not great.,"This tent was great for about a day or two. Then the poles started coming apart and it collapsed on my son one night. I tried to ""fix"" it, and it's staying up but still not the way it should be. Bottom line is, this tent would probably be great for a toddler bed. It says on the package that it is for a twin bed, but it's not big enough for a twin."
1,One of the worst ever.,"Horrible page layouts, terrible proportions, pony tails, little brown pockets, and lines, SO many unnecessary lines. Rob Liefeld is THE quintessential 90s comic book artist: over-blown, over-done, and over-hyped. Never has so little talent taken up so many pages. Run, don't walk, away from anything even remotely associated with Mr. Liefeld."
3,The geometry of geodesic domes using cut-out models,"This is classified as a children's book, but it isn't so simple. It would be suitable for teenagers but the mathematics is relevant whatever your age and it is described clearly and concisely. However, if you're looking for a book on dome architecture this is not for you. There are two models that demonstrate the ideas about the subdivision of triangles to approximate the sphere based on the octahedron and the icosahedron. Then there are three 'architectural' dome models and lastly a model of the carbon molecule bukminsterfullerene. Each model is included for a reason and there's an explanatory text to accompany each one. The book does not cover real examples of domes much (only a sketch of the Expo 67 pavilion), although the introduction briefly explains the history and reason for them. It is important to understand that this is not a book about dome architecture: it covers the math behind the concept and explains it using cut-out models."
4,Geodesic Basics,The book provides basic insights into geodesic design of higher frequency structures from the fundamental icosehdral blocks. Cut out patterns provide some hands on builds. Worth the money.
4,cutest costume!!,I ordered the kids Frankenstein costume for my son who just turned 3 and it is great. It is made of a fleece material so it will keep him warm for a chilly Halloween night! I ordered the toddler size 3/4 and it fits perfectly. I would recommend this costume to any parent.
4,Cute,"Cute costume. It runs large so I will use it next year for halloween as well. Great deal, the reatil stores wanted $30+ for it. I would never pay that much!!"
1,lil frankie costume,"I sent this item back. It was pictured with a zipper, but was a pullover instead. Also when it was unfolded the patch decals were stuck together and partially peeled off. I was very excited to receive this, but it irritated my son's skin. Too bad."
3,costume not toy,A little cheaper made than expected. Bolts were squished and didnt stick out like they should have I guess from shipment
2,cute costume but dissapointing,"The picture was alot cuter than the actual costume. The hat was not square like it looked like in the picture, and the material was cheap. I was expecting something better. Alot better."
2,You get what you pay for!,It was cute but the quality was poor! At least it had some fleece lining because it was a cold night.
4,Cute and $$$$ Good Value,I found this item very cute and well made for the price. You do have to unwrap it with caution. It has decals on it that do cling together from shipping. I would recommend this costume for you. It fit my 3 year old perfectly.
3,For collectors of historic recordings,"If you are a collector of historic recordings, or an avid Rubinstein collector, than this record is for you. I, on the other hand, am neither, and I had trouble enjoying the Piano Concerto due to the poor sound quality of this 60-year old recording. The sound quality of the remainder of the disc was much better. So, if an ""old"" sounding record doesn't bother you, I'm sure you'll love it. I'm from the CD generation, and I'm going to look for another version of the Concerto."
4,Tape Cassete Belt Buckle,"I really like this buckle, but it's bigger than I expected. It's of good quality."
2,Quilted Scrapbooks,"Hi. I gave this book 2 stars because it had a bent cover & a few bent pages.Otherwise,the book was in good shape.Thank you for the good shipingTook A little more time then I thought it should have, to get to me, but it made it to me ok."
5,An extremely worthwhile book and a wonderful read,"Red Fox Road is one of those rare books which tells a great story and handles an issue of planetary importance with a thorough and well balanced understanding. It's also fun to read.Mr. Gould manages to weave an engaging tale that precisely evokes the sense of place, portrays characters so well that one feels a sense of solid recognition, and moves it all along at a pace that puts the reader's attention in a vise until a day or so after the last page has been read.One gets a kind of wonder as Red Fox Road unfolds, as it stays believable and engaging in a style that somehow manages to be both evocative and economical. The characters breathe. You can feel their emotions, sensations, and get a gist of their reasoning. The magic of the forests comes alive.Red Fox Road has an unpretentious intelligence and feeling for the characters while building a credible and suspense filled story. It is thoroughly enjoyable and very highly recommended."
5,Very Captivating,"A very intriguing story, which puts you right in the middle of the characters dilema. It keeps you on the edge right up untill the last page is turned. One of those books that you cant put down, and captivates your mind right up until the very end. Richard Gould did a wonderful job of making you feel the characters dilema. Its a wonderful story."
3,Won't clean my .22,"This might be good for most guns, but it's aweful for .22's. The way the rods are threaded you can only use two out of the three rods with the .22 adapter, and that's not long enough to clean the bore. Plus the patch threader is very small, even by .22 standards and is hard to get a patch into. I have an Outer's universal cleaning kit that's much better, and there's no reason why Remington's shouldn't be also."
4,All-A-Round Cleaning Kit,"I bought this cleaning kit to use while I am out shooting guns. I can roll it out on the tailgate/bench, lay the guns out on the mat while shooting, and clean them on the spot when I am done. Only 4 stars because the threads on the rod end accessories and adapters do not thread into the rods securely as if they will eventually strip out. Otherwise very convenient."
4,Bought the kit,"When I am not playing my balalaika or feeding my bear, I like cleaning my AK-47 with this cleaning kit by Remington.Contains all you need. The quality is ok. Good purchase."
5,Disappointed,"The sunglasses did not fit, and I had to spend $6.00 in postage to return them for a $14.99 credit. I don't think that is fair, and I won't be buying anything else through Amazon."
3,sweet book but above review does not match the actual product,"This book is very sweet and a nicekeepsake for any daughter. Although I purchased it based on the above review for what I thought was the same book but it turns out the review for this book is actually for another book titled ""Dear Daughter: A Message of Love"". I of course didn't realize this until I received the book today and saw that it was not what I was anticipating to get for my daughter. Lesson learned I guess and unfortunatley it's too late to order the correct book that the author of the above review recommended since I intended for this to be a birthday gift for my daughter.All in all , this book DEAR DAUGHTER, SIMPLY SAID is your typical mini book filled with heartwarming and insirational quotes for a daughter. Nothing any more speical that any other mini book I've seen which is why it get 3 stars."
3,I can relate to this book,"""Felicia The Critic"" is a neat book because it is realistic. In fact, my brother is a lot like Felicia. I thought it was cute how she decided to do ""constructive critsism"". If you agree on what I think of this book email me at StarGrl684@aol.com. Thank you! --Madeline"
1,Complete Nonsense and Propaganda,"I was awaiting this film for over a year and it finally made it to the States. I was over joyed to buy it. After I finished watching the movie, I thought to myself "" Did I get the right movie?""Truth is: This movie has nothing to do with Andrei Chikatilo. All and I mean all facts and incidents are incorrect. The film is not true to Chikatilo's real lifestyle. The acting is fake and embarrasing to watch. Malcolm McDowell looks like Adolf Hitler, not Chikatilo. The director deviates this movie so far from reality, it's sad to give him credit for it.Oooh and by the way, if you want to see Malcolm get naked together with a cop and have the cop jerk him off, While yelling "" Look how hard your prick is,"" please feel free to buy this movie. Talk about hardcore facts about Andrei Chikatilo jerking cops off on the side.Waste of time, money and complete disappointment. You want the true Chikatilo, see Citizen X instead."
3,Russian rude awakening,"Russia finallly enters the 20th century socially with their revelation that they have a serial killer, a concept totally foriegn to their way of life and thinking-althouigh this version is a fictionalized docudrama style film, it is done with an unwavering adhesion to the facts of this case, one of the most prolific serial killers of all time much less Russia- Malcolm Mcdowell was superb,totally capturing the essence of depravity that no doubt infused the murderer, and leading you down a path you dont want to follow, but must-although much of this was covered [and very well] in the movie Citizen X, it delves deeper into the lives all of those involved in the case, and definitely holds your attention to the end"
4,Good dvd:,This is one of those movies that keep you on the edge of your seat.It had me saying oh no through out the whole movie. His wife had so much trust in him.....sad!
2,Disappointing,After watching Citizen X I found this not near as engaging but a different view. Disappointing to say the least.Wouldn't watch again.
5,MUST READ for aspiring & experienced global managers,"Downside is there is no chapter on Re-patriation, what happens when you come back to your head-quarters or home country.MUST READ for people planning assignment abroad or aspiring to a global career. Makes go balance between the theory of use of international experience in development and practical what it takes for an individual to succeed with guidance from experienced executives. Also covers potential derailment.Includes a list of global competencies (characteristics) and making sense of culture.Should be on any HR curiculum for global HR management !"
4,A great help to a real beginer!,"This book guided me step by step through many projects. Every step is explained in words and pictures, which made it very easy to follow along. I also found the knowing the parts of the machine section in the beginning of the book very helpful. At the end of each project several variations are suggested and explained. Some requiring greater skills, but still achievable ones by the average beginner. My only complaint was that after completing the duvet cover project and making a coordinating flanged pillow set, I realized that the book did not include instructions on making the bed skirt. The photograph that introduces the duvet cover project shows a bed skirt - I think a good addition to the book would be bed skirt instructions. This would allow the beginner to complete a bed redecorate project in the same easy to follow instruction manual."
3,copy cat of sewing 101,"I wanted this book so bad, so i went with one of the deals, two books for the price of x.]one of the books sewing 101 was on my list as well. Got them home and bingo, same pictures for duvet covers, some of the same identical print...., same insturctions, so i have 2 books, some money invested, and the same photo's. same instrucitons well you get i have a repeat of a book that i was lead to believe was on it's own so to speak and it is not. it is so tiny too.... thanks."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I got this book thinking that it was going to be for a complete beginner (like me), but I really did not think that it was, seemed to be more directed toward someone with some sewing experience or skill.I wasted my money on this book."
4,"good atmospheric music, 2 excellent roger waters songs","The Roger Waters music (23 minutes) is great even though it was mostly atmospheric music. If that was all that was on the CD, I'd give it 5 stars. However, the other music was not as good. The Genesis song was really good, the Bowie song was okay, and the other songs...were bad.So, I took off 1 star for them. But, if you want this CD because of Roger Waters, its worth it if you can find it..."
3,Nice Waters music,"This CD contains a 3 minute song by David Bowie, a horrible song by Hugh Cornwell, a good but not spectacular Genesis instrumental, a surprisingly good song by Squeeze (I was never a fan), a nice new-age jazz number from Paul Hardcastle and a 25 minute piece from Roger Waters, listed as the last 8 tracks on the CD. The Roger Waters piece starts out with an excellent 7 minute song. The next 12 minutes are space music, noises and clips from the movie. Some it is very good but those parts only last a minute or so and are interpersed between parts that are only of entertainment value in the context of the movie. The last 6 minutes is another song that is on par with the better things on Radio Kaos, (some interesting parts but overall nothing special). There is a great female singer, excellent sax from Mel Collins, and some good guitar playing (but Andy Fairweather-Low is not on this CD as someone said)."
2,What a waste of $,I am a huge PFloyd fan and I bought this Cd because of Roger Waters. This album is a waste of money and the only nice songs (2 of them) resemble in parts other songs done by Waters. Save your money!
4,Sociology: A Guide to Reference and Information Sources 3rd Edition,"In the 3rd Edition the reference contains revisions and updates of in the areas related to social sciences and sociology along. Further the sociological collection includes bibilographies such as author(s), indexes, abstracts, place of publication, publishing companies, ISBN or ISSN as well as the date of publication. Furthermore, electronic sources, journals and legititmate ULRs that are available in this editonThis reference book's target audience is mainly college for undergraduate to post-graduate students, faculty members and the general public who conduct research on the subject of race, ethnicity and gender studies."
3,Miro Earth and Sky Art For Children,"The book's story is written in a style mimicing Miro's early surrealistic style and would be difficult for many young readers to grasp, many details are left out, the reader must figure them out as they go along. An interesting technique but probably more confusing than appealing to most youngsters. The insets of photos of the artist,his work,places he lived and things which influenced him all with explanations are excellent and highly informative."
5,a must for all types of brain injury thank you dr mason,i have a moderate traumatic brain injury and thought seeing the word mildthat the book would be too easy. not so. dr mason clearly states infoon traumatic brain injury and has exercises for one to do.i waited a yr for this book. and i agree with dr mason in doing theexercises in the order of the book. better yet get some tracing paperand cover the exercises so you can go back and do them again andagain. the mazes are not too easy...in fact i had to start at the beginninggo to teh middle and then go to the finish and work my way back.th anks again dr mason
4,The TBI Bible If you have a loved one with TBI you will need this book!,We got the book shortly after our son's head injury and have not put it down since. The book has sections on every aspect of head injury and guides you through the process of recovery. The exercises were a little challenging but eventually manageable. If you have a loved one with a head injury this book is a must.
5,helpful,i was in a car accident and suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. i found this book extremely helpful and informative. the key thing to remember is that a brain injury is very different for each person. so some parts of the book probably wont apply to your situation. but i think this book does a good job of covering the overall symptoms of brain injuries. the book also gives you exercises to do throughout it which breaks up the reading and makes it more interesting.
2,A good beginning.,"The MTBI Workbook establishes an initial overview of symptom identification, brain organization, and early rehab steps and for this it is a good initial contact for a patient having experienced MTBI. However, it lacks more training tools for the client when an addendum could provide for more enriched training containing tools, exercises, and the like. Also, it lists a number of occupations and professionals involved in a rehab process without mentioning social workers in the provision of care. As a licensed clinical social worker with a moderate MTBI case load I can only ponder the reason for this grevious omission by the author. I wish I could give this a better review, but find no cause to do so. Again, a good beginning, but not a total solution."
3,Useful but needs help with guided approach,"Needs more structural work to assist those with varying degrees of disability. More on ""how to use this book"" would be useful. For brain injury patients, these is no such thing as giving too much direction, ezpecially for those with minimal tolerance for books and written material. I did not find it possible to attack page 4, for example, and move streadily forward from there. Some sections were beond my limit of understanding and patience. It was sometimes difficult to see why the workbook tackled certain topics.The workbook approach opens the door to a new type of thinking aboutthe issues that is not available in other publcations today and that is the true value of this book."
4,An artist at work,"When these recordings were made, hearing music coming from a rudimental display was probably considered a miracle; discs were made to amaze people, maybe to show off technical improvements, an above all to sell music: the quality of the recorded performance didn't matter too much, while the important thing was to have a Waltz by Chopin or a Prelude by Debussy on record. But Arthur Rubinstein always did concern about quality: he didn't make any mechanical piano recording, because he thought the piano sounded ""like a banjo"", and he accepted to get into a studio only after being sure the results were going to be worthy. While other musicians did anything to get immortalized into Concerto-for-banjo-like recordings, Ruby chose to wait until recorded music was a serious thing. Indeed, in this early selection of encores, we hear a great pianist, but an even greater artist, in whom we can easily recognise the main character of Rubinstein's beautiful autobiography."
3,By the end I was disappointed,"The book started off amazingly well. I was very excited to find out what next. The book did a good job of introducing the technique and giving hints on how to implement them. After the first several chapters, however, the implementation gets left behind and the reader is given a series of chapters on disjointed topics. The author who was weaving such a beautiful web toward the beginning stopped doing everything that make the book great. There was no longer any explanation about how one topic led to the next and implementation was no longer touched upon.This book is an adequate introduction to the concepts but I found it sorely lacking when it came to help on implementation."
3,Second edition still full of errors,"I had heard about how many errors this book originally had and assumed that these would be fixed for the Second Edition printing -- well, they weren't. There's a typo on nearly every other page, plus some serious formula errors.Also, the book isn't very balanced. Some parts go into too much detail, and others not nearly enough.I returned this book the day after I received it."
3,Disjointed,"Riddled with errors. Towards the end of the book, the material becomes very thin. While Shirley does cover some advanced techniques, I found his explantions to be lacking. If you're going to buy this book, wait for the second edition. Glassner is a much better text on ray tracing."
2,Disappointed,"Compare to the first edition, major improvement include libraries of C++ code but unfortunately, lack of explanations.No offense to Mr.Shirley, but this book is riddled with errors, some of the materials provided at the end of each chapters were DIFFERENT from the code on the server. Not sure which one should be follow.If you intend to write you own path-tracer from scratch, I will definitely not recommend this book. Reading this book requires knowledge on much other theories, such as calculus, probability and other... which were very briefly mentioned in the text.If you intend to understand global illumination and radiometry, I would recommend ""Advanced Global Illumination"" by Philip Dutre, Philippe Bekaert and Kavita Bala. This is a much better book which explains things clearly."
2,Overpriced,"Product is a good fit but very thin. WeatherTech needs to spend less on advertising and more on quality, it feels and looks cheap"
5,"great price, great product","no complaints. The product is exactly as it was advertised. Also, it shipped quickly. Would recommend as a product that works perfectly at a great price."
3,"Insightful, a little slow, but a climactic denouement","(yes, I meant the pun in the title. read the book, re-read my review, it'll seem funnier. really.)Tepper, when asked why so many of her stories had small furry creatures who sing in them, said 'Cats singing on my desk as I work.'I read this book when I was 15, and I have to admit, it was a helpful thing to learn; that everyone remembers things differently, and only by pooling our stories can we possibly attempt to reach the truth.The book is a little slow to start; revealment is layered, and occasionally could be sped up a little. Additionally, like many of Tepper's early books, the bad guys is bad. Her more recent bad guys tend to have a little more depth."
4,One of Tepper's first and most unusual worlds,"While I found this book confusing at first, as I persevered the story gradually crystalized. That's an appropriate way of putting it, as the book is set on a planet filled with lovely but fractile crystal structures that shatter, killing foot travellers. The trip singers have created soothing musical sounds to play to each structure, which allow passage. But are the singers commuicating with the crystals and are the crystals a new form of intelligent life? If so, planetary exploitation can be halted.Tepper has a great imagination and creates believable situations that speak into our own time and lives as well.I was ultimately caught up in the dilemma and found the conclusion immensely satisfying. Worth hanging on through the initially confusing stages, for the characters are ultimately well developed and the reader cares what happens to them."
5,"One of Tepper's most memorable books, and I've read them all","I started reading Tepper's books years ago, starting with the ""True Game"" series. I've loved everyone of her books. But I think that the alien intelligences in ""Raising the Stones"" are the best realized of any Sci. Fi. book Ever! How funny, they didn't realize men were intelligent!"
5,"Beautiful Reproductions of Blaeu Maps, Very Complete","The vivid colors of many of Blaeu's maps are accurately reproduced, and the detail of the images is good enough to read the place-names of the beautiful maps. John Goss' captions detail the history behind each map, as well as the occasional note about the production of the map. A must for any avid map collector."
2,"Great Playing, but...","Trying a second round with this recording. The playing is great, my favorite for this music, but both discs have a serious defect with a background ""clicking"" that rises and falls with the volume of the playing. . . very distracting."
3,Very Thin,"I got these for my bridesmaids as one of my wedding presents. Many of them are from warm climates and living in a colder climate I thought they might want a wrap to warm up.These are VERY thin. They are maybe something you can wear on a warm evening to cover up, but do not rely on them for warmth. The are so thin, I would almost compare them to gauze.They do look nice, and the color was true to the picture. If you are looking for a lightweight wrap, I would recommend this product to you."
1,doesn't even smell like it should,"This product is not what it seems. Its runny and watery, it doesn't even feel like lotion its mostly water. It also has a weird smell (dust) it doesnt smell like the purfume which was very diappointing being that perfume is my favorite."
2,No PC = no editing?,"Without a PC, it's strickly tranferring video to DVD. Most productst that works with a PC can give you more choices for editing and burn DVD with menu."
1,Review of Sony VRD-MC3 DVD Recorder,"After having a second unit shipped to me by Amazon, I had to ship this unit to Sony Tech Repair to have the software updated so it will operate correctly with my Sony DCR-PC100 camcorder without the MC3 'losing signal' partway through a DVD transfer recording from my camera when using the DV (Firewire) cable, as did the first unit which I sent back to Amazon.It is only through the DV interface that the MC3 can recognize that my camera recording is in wide screen mode (16x9) and give me a wide screen DVD recording, which is why I purchased the MC3 in the first place.I am still awaiting the MC3 to be sent back to me from Sony after reprogramming it for my camera, and I hope it works this time. If the MC3 allows me to copy from the miniDV tape in the camera to a DVD in widescreen mode, as it is recorded on the camera tape, then I would rate this unit much higher- say a 5."
1,not what I expected,"I purchased this dvd recorder to go with the sony hdd camcorder. They should have been perfectly compatible, but mine has been nothing but trouble. The first time I used it, it simply froze at 99% complete and I had to shut it down and start over after waiting 3 hours for it to finish. After that, it recorded from the camera, but seemingly randomly, not in the order I videotaped on the camera, and incompletely burned video segments from the camera as well. Plus, there is no editing capability whatsoever with this device. I use very high quality Taiyo Yuden dvd's in it, so I know it is not the discs."
1,Easy as pie to use...but quality stinks!,"It worked right from the get go as far as recording my VHS tape, very easy to figure out. And I had no problems with formatting my DVD (I used Windata DVD-R) or recording. What I DID have a problem with is that the final result drops frames, resulting in a jerky stop-motion look. Also, there is no way to tell how much time you have left to record until it just suddenly stops recording. Seems to me a DVD should hold at least two hours, but it only held about an hour and a half. I was really excited at first when it seemed like it would work perfectly, and then so disappointed with the poor results and the inadequate information needed for stress-free recording."
4,Great when it works,"I bought this right after Christmas. Went through several brands (Sony, TDS, Philips, Fuji,etc..) of disks. Had about 10-12 coasters. Either received ""Failed to format."" or ""Failed to finalize."" I grew so frustrated that I wanted to throw it away.Well, I returned it and got another one. Nothing but bliss. Everything I taped has worked. Would give 5 stars, but I had to take the first one back."
2,Not satisfied with the product,"The device freezes up almost 50% of the time, mostly with ""failed to record"" errors. This has been happening frustratingly close towards the end of a recording. So, after waiting for almost an hour I have to re-do the recording all over again. I have a Sony mini-DV camcorder and I am using Sony's DVD as recommended. Link to the recorder is firewire. Another observation... sometimes I need to close the lcd screen on the camcorder in order for the recorder to detect the input signal. Will probably return it unless Sony tech support can come up with a solution. Quite disappointing..."
2,VRDMC3 DVDirect DVD Recorder,"It does not do what it claims to do when it comes to recording/downloading images from a digital camera's flash card. It appears to be recording, but the end result is viewable neither on a DVD attached to a TV nor on a computer, so there is no point in using it for that.It was successful in transferring/recording a home VHS tape onto a DVD. However, the DVD can only be viewed on a TV, not a computer, so it cannot be edited.I am not happy with the product, but the VHS feature at least works."
5,"Useful little unit, no problems","I've had good results with this unit. I've used it for the last few weeks, and haven't yet produced a dreaded ""coaster"" (non-working DVD). The DVD's I've created look razor sharp (I'm using it mainly to transfer material from old 8mm analog video cassettes), I appreciate the multiple inputs, including memory cards, which I've used to archive photos from my digital camera, and I especially appreciate this unit's ease-of-use. Good job, Sony!"
4,It couldn't be easier!,"I have been putting off the project of converting all of my old VHSC and DV tapes of my children growing up, into DVD's. I read that the tapes only last for around 15 years or so and I don't use a VCR anymore, so I needed to make the change.It seemed too complicated to somehow hook my VCR, or camera up to my computer and then load up my hard drive with the movies, so I bought this product. It is very easy to use, just plug in your VCR, or Camcorder and let it run. The recorder conveniently puts in 5 minute ""chapter"" references to make moving through the disc more simple. The picture quality is as good as the source. I'm very pleased."
1,sony recorder,"I went to our local Best Buy to purchase this item. The salesman stated that it would only work with a SONY camcorder or any other SONY equipment. Needless to say, I have samsung vcr so it won't work unless I get SONY EQUIPMENT. Pathetic."
5,Great Educational Tool For A Toddler,"My goddaughter who is 27 months old is enjoying and learning a lot from this book! It's easy to flip through its pages without it getting damaged easily by a pair of hyperactive hands. Plus, its colorful pictures makes it an interesting subject for someone who does not have a lot of attention span. Overall, it's a great educational tool for a toddler who's just beginning to learn and understand about the things surrounding them. Fisher Price Lift the Flap Playbooks is a must-have for toddlers' learning."
1,Poor Condition,This item was not accurately described. It was very used and had most of the flaps torn out. This seller should be marked for poor product.
4,Great book!,"This is a great book. I got it for my first daughter when she was 1 and she loved it, and now my second daughter (9 months) loves it as well. This isn't really a book they can look at by themselves though as there are a lot of small flaps. I've had to glue a few back on after being torn off. But it is a great book to read together!"
5,Great fun for 1 and 3 year olds,This is the greatest book ever... Both my three year old and one year old love for me to read this book with them. They are so delighted to see what is under the flap. They both seek out this book so they can sit and look at it quietly by themselves. The three year old loves to talk about what is going on in each scene and guessing what is under the flaps. The colorful illustrations can't help but keep little ones interested as well.
5,This is my 14 month old son's favorite book.,"My 14 month old will choose this book over any of his others. It has helped him learn about shapes, colors and different animals and items found on the farm. We can ask him where the lamb is or to point to the tractor, and he knows what we are talking about. The book is fun and educational. I highly recommend this book for toddlers that are past the ""I want to rip the pages out of the book"" faze of life."
4,An enjoyable assortment for saxophone fans.,"This unusual sextet utilizes the full range of saxophones from sopranino to contra-bass in an interesting mix of musical styles. I do wish they'd drop the silliness from their CDs as represented by their arrangement of ""Tip Toe Through The Tulips""."
3,Stylish,"Relatively easy to assemble with a classic and practical design. It is made of real wood and leather, and does not look cheap, yet reasonably priced. I have had these (4) for over 2 years now, and they have held up well with moderate use except for one. Some of the balls in the bearings that make it swivel had come out. It is still useable but the seat wobbles a little bit."
2,wouldn't purchase again,"Boxes arrived in good shape although there were no assembly instructions provided.I ordered two chairs, each came in it's own packaging. The provided hardware was different for each chair and the chairs were in different stages of assembly...go figure! I was able to figure it out since I have been awaiting a response to my request for instructions for 3 days (they were to send via e-mail). Chairs are now assembled, hopefully correctly. They look okay for what I paid but the assembley nightmare will make me think twice about ordering from this vendor."
4,Mostly wonderful,"While it's true that the ""Fantasie"" could be more energetic and incisive, as noted in the previous review here, Rubinstein's ""Kreisleriana"" is just amazing. This difficult piece, alternating and combining lyricism, obsessive passion, and eccentric wit, receives an ""elder statesman's"" performance in the best sense from the nearly 80-year-old master. The rapid passages are crytalline, the slower ones sing, and the poetry of the whole work comes alive, without exaggeration or showiness; plus, the sound of the piano is unfailingly beautiful. This ""Kreisleriana"" is a great example of the art of Schumann and of Rubinstein."
2,Purely theoric,"This book concentrates only in concise theory, don't giving any further explanation or real-life examples in music. Aside that, the book wastes several chapters in basic music theory telling what any amateur musician already know. For me it was useless."
5,NANA Rocks!,"This whole series is such a great deal! it's idealy for teens older than 16, because it is packed with drama, romance, sex, and alcohol. It's basically about two girls who are both named Nana, and they turn into the best of friends in Tokyo. Nana K. is very girly and naive, and she's also kinda a pushover. She falls for guys ALL THE TIME, and was cheated on by her bf. Nana K. is a tough band singer on the other hand..read on to find out more about these 2 awesome girls!!!"
5,Good flavor,"This coffee has very good flavor and reminds me of my time living in Jordan. It sure brought back many memories. That said, I have finally found a local supplier that is much more reasonably priced. But if you can't find Turkish coffee in your area, this is a very good product."
3,Good small little umbrella,"It fits nicely in my purse all compact and doesn't get in the way. it opens up to a bit smaller than i'm used to, and the flashlight on the bottom...won't detach on mine, seems to get stuck. This does not have an automatic open or close. Apparently i missed that in the description."
3,"good art, okay story","well, you probably know by now that the entire cast is different than the alpha flight you probably knew and loved (with the exception of sasquatch and nemesis). this book mostly concerns the beginning of the new team and as a consequence is fairly slow, and unfortunately it isn't likely to satisfy new fans or old fans. but if you have an open mind you'll enjoy the humor which, while not particularly sophisticated or unique, is pleasantly light-hearted. the artwork and some of the new characters (including the new (and female!) puck) is probably the biggest draw to this book, but if you're like me you'll buy it just b/c either are or want to be canadian and you love alpha flight no matter what."
3,Decent book but theories are already wiely in use...,"I was a little dissapointed in this book. I thought it would be usefule to me (as the title suggests), but was not. I am a web developer with over 5 years experience and I found the book very repetitive of the theories and practices I employ on a daily basis. I did find a few suggestions in the book that I haven't either thought of or actually implimented but overall, I felt it was a little generic.Most web designers will notice that the book is generic and offers them little new information. Of all the books I've read, this was one of the least helpful.However, for someone just getting into web development, this book could be a big help in establishing a strong foundation of principles."
2,But Who's it for?,"Friends of the writer will (have?) hyped the book. It's a good effort, but like nearly every book being flung out of pub houses on ""web design"" these days, it's 20% useful and 80% pure superficial crud. Nearly all of what's here is a rehash of what anyone with six months' experience already knows. It's *NOT* a book about ""everything"" to do with the web, or with web design, or with building web sites. Or anything.Go to you local bookstore, check it out like you would any expensive-and-out-of-date-in-a-few-months computer book, pick up a tip or two, then put it back on the shelf. They recycle them eventually, you know."
2,Alright,"This book has some REALLY good info on why breastfeeding is best. However, if you don't subscribe to the author's way of parenting (attachment parenting) than you're better off reading another breastfeedng book that is soley about breastfeeding and not about pushing a way of parenting on to you that you may or may not agree with. Especially if you do plan on returning to work."
4,Great book for those set on breastfeeding,"This book is full of helpful information and how-to's. If you're set on breastfeeding exclusively, go ahead and buy it. If you are thinking of supplementing, pick another book because this one will make you feel bad about it. I agree with the majority of the information, although sometimes it's presented in a really preachy manner. Oh- and skip the intro - it really made me wonder about these people when I read that she had breastfed one of her children for FOUR YEARS! Look past the preachy attitude and you will find this book very helpful."
1,Not useful for preemie babies,"I bought this book to prepare for my child's birth. Unfortunatly, the baby came a lot sooner than I had planned. I found the section on feeding preemie babies to be narrow, militant in tone and not at all practical. Because so many of the chapters are repetitious on the topic of the dangers of giving your baby a bottle (and makes it sound akin to giving the baby crack) - it leaves no room for the fact that sometimes it is not up to the parents. I hated this book more and more as time went on and threw my copy away the day the baby came home from the hospital. Despite Sears' admonition not bottle-feed, I pumped and gave my baby a bottle for 2 months until he was strong enough to breastfeed. I had no problem getting him to do so."
3,Good How to Book,I read many breastfeeding books in preparation for the birth of my daughter. This one was okay. The actual how to's of breastfeeding were great. I could have done without the long chapter on the greatness of breastfeeding and ills of formula. I didn't find it very helpful for planning for my return to work and pumping. The short chapter on weaning was not very informative at all. Like another reader said it went into a lot of toddler nursing info and focused more on letting the baby lead weaning. It really won't help any mother who is trying to wean by her own choice.
4,Great Resource!,"This has been one of the best resources for me. I'm a new mom and it's been great having a book to refer to if I can't get in touch with my Le Leche League leader. There is some repeat information if you already have The Baby Book as well, but I still think it's worth it to get this one. This would be a great gift for a mom to be. Good luck! It's worth all of the effort!"
5,Another great book from Dr. Sears,"Everything you need to know about Breastfeeding your baby is here in this book. Dr. Sears Attachment Parenting style shines through as he helps you over the bumps and bruises of breastfeeding your newborn, all the way through to extended breastfeeding of your toddler. A must have for all AP mommies!"
5,Great book! Will not intimidate mothers-to-be!,"I have read lots of breastfeeding books and found most boring and hard to read. This book is great, easy to follow and great to read."
2,Good basic book but you can do better,I think this book is OK but I think if you want an excelent book you should get Dr. Jack Newman's book The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers. It has a lot of great informaiton much of it cutting edge!
3,Do not read this book if you have any trouble breastfeeding!,This book does have some good information in it like the charts of what things you can and cant take while breastfeeding and how to keep your nutrition up. But these two are so opinionated that you end up feeling like a failure if you have any trouble breastfeeding. I was reading this book because I was having trouble producing milk. I had an emergency c-section and mastitis. My doctor starting supplementing my son on formula because he was not gaining enough weight. Between not producing milk and reading this book I felt like the worst mother doing a disservice to my son when we finally gave up on breastfeeding. I felt like it was my fault and I was just not doing things right and not the truth that my body was not able to do it. In the end if you are a successful with breastfeeding this book makes a good reference but RUN far away from this book if you are having any problems breastfeeding.
5,The Breastfeeding Book: Everything you need to know about nursing your child from birth through weaning,"This is a great reference for first time mothers. I knew nothing about breastfeeding when I got preganant, now I recommend this book to every pregnant woman that I see. It really does have everything you need to know. It even has websites and phone numbers to manufacturers and distributers of products especially for breastfeeding mothers. With the help of this book I successfully breastfed both my child through the entire first year of their lives while holding down a full time job outside of our home. It is wonderful"
5,A must-have for breastfeeding moms!,"I read this book cover to cover during my pregnancy, which helped me know what to expect when my first baby was born. After he was born, we had a difficult time getting the breastfeeding started, so I referred to it numerous times to read about engorgement, latching on, pumping, storing milk, and even weaning when the time came. I always buy this book for friends who are planning to breastfeed, since it was such an invaluable resource to me. The Sears' combine their medical experience with their personal experience to make you feel like they have been there and can offer some practical advice for many situations. I highly recommend this informative and comforting book."
5,Loved it,"I used this book constantly for the 1st 3weeks of breastfeeding. It was so helpful I can't imagine what I would have done without it. My baby had trouble latching on in the beginning, so I had to pump my milk, and the section on pumping was extremely helpful too. Once we got her breastfeeding again I used all the tips the book offered and we are now off to a great start."
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"I love the Sears' book collection. I started with The Pregnancy Book, then read the Breastfeeding Book. It was so interesting I read it in 2 days! It's fully informative and tells you everything you need to know to feel confident in breastfeeding. Now I am ordering The Baby Book."
4,Good!,A good and resourceful book. Written by a LLL leader & her physician husband. I bought this book for my daughter-in-law and it has been passed around to the other daughters. Excellent purchase decision!
2,Not that impressived,"I was not that impressed with this book or any of the Sears' books. When we found out I was having twins we quickly bought all the books that we thought would help. Thier books are wordy and not to the point. They also make you feel like a child abuser if you occasionally give your baby, or babies, a bottle or binkie. This book did have a few good suggestions but not enough that I would recommend it.....especially for mothers of twins or anyone with unusual circumstances. just so you know, my twins are four months and I am still breastfeeding. Good luck to you."
3,get the baby book instead,"I bought this when I bout the Dr Sears baby book, and was really disappointed that everything in this book was in the Baby book as well.I love the Baby book, but the Breastfeeding book doesn't go any further in depth.This was a waste for me :("
4,Good resource,"I am currently breastfeeding my 9 month old daughter. I found this book to be very helpful and a great resource. I felt like I had a support system whenever ran into any bumps along the way. By the way, I think they had great advice about pumping, storage and going back to work guilt free."
3,Informative but VERY repetative,"I think this book is readable and user friendly, but much of the content in there is repeated over and over. I get the sense that with an excellent editor, it could have been pared down to at least half the size. That said, I found it to be very helpful-- and one of the best books I looked at on how to breastfeed an infant. Ideally, we'd not need books to learn how to breastfeed, but..... this is a good choice if you have no idea what breastfeeding is all about. It makes an excellent companion to the Sears' ""The Baby Book,"" ""The Pregnancy Book,"" and ""The Birth Book."" If you're thinking ever remotely of natural childbirth, ""The Birth Book"" is an absolute MUST."
2,"While somewhat informative, this book is very opinionated","Being a first time mother, I was looking for a book to help with me learn basic breast feeding techniques. I was suprised to find that this book basically calls you a failure as a mother if you don't breast feed. As a woman who holds a degree in child development I know all the reasons why you should breast feed. However, for this book to suggest that a mother avoid treating an illness so they can avoid using formula is LUDICROUS!!!! If you don't believe me, it is on page 95 and states ""The risks of exposing a baby to a drug in breast milk should be weighed against the risk of exposing a baby to infant formula"". I believe that statement goes to the extreme. Also, This book makes a lot of claims based on scientific data but provides no references to this research."
4,Good reference for breastfeeding,"1. All this info is in the baby book by the Sears.2. It is all good info. Yes, there are always a few things I don't agree with or don't care for, but overall it's good.3. It gives references to the LLL.*** Moms, get over feeling guilty because of a book. The book is there to give you good info. Read it. Do your best. ASK HELP FROM THE LLL OR A LACTATION CONSULTANT."
2,Some good information if you don't mind being a failure,"I bought this book when I was having problems breastfeeding after getting mastitis. My production almost stopped.This wasn't a good book to buy when I was already that close to stopping breastfeeding. As my supply continued to diminish, I felt like more and more of a failure.If you stay home and are able to feed your baby and not worry about needing to pump, the book is fine.If you work and are having any problems, this book will make you feel awful. After all, adoptive mothers can build a milk supply - if you just had a baby, what's wrong with you that you can't - FAILURE!The Sears family needs to realize that some people just can't breastfeed and need to be a little kinder to those who can't. I can understand wanting people to breastfeed, but they need to realize that people who buy the book don't need to be convinced to breastfeed; they probably already are but are having problems."
1,This book makes you feel like a failure.,"While I was pregnant, I bought 3 books on breastfeeding. I read this one first from cover to cover. I was very pro breastfeeding and very anti bottle after reading this book. I had every intention of breastfeeding my first child... This book has you so dead set against any bottles (at all) that when the nurse said they could give him a supplemental bottle just once and then I could try again after that, I thought it was over. This book has made me feel guilty from the moment my baby got that first bottle. I'll always wonder -- If I had never read this book, I wouldn't have been so hard on myself and I wouldn't have thought that formula was evil and I would have had more success at breastfeeding. Not to mention this book gives very unrealistic ideals that no mother, or maybe I should say no WORKING mother, could live up to. I wish I had never read this book."
