2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this product - actually TWO of this product - one for me and one for my daughter. We have had many breadmakers in the past - this one just isn't a good choice in our opinion. The display is hard to read, the instructions difficult to follow and it's just not user friendly at all. We returned them both and got the Zojirushi breadmaker instead - more money but definitely worth it! If you want an easy to use breadmaker with great options, this is probably not the one for you."
1,Unhappy!,I have had this breadmaker for about 6 weeks now and haven't been able to make one satisfactory loaf of whole wheat bread yet. The loaves are small. The measurements . are too exacting. You are encouraged to weigh yourIngredients which is ridiculous. And some of the measurements are for sixteenths. I am sorry I bought this machine. I have to figure out what to do now. It is too late to return it I think. I will certainly not get anotherBreadmaker through the mail. Too much trouble to return it. Please don't buy this machine. I don't understand why it has gotten good reviews. I will try to call Panasonic and get some help.
5,an excellent bread maker,"I read ALL the reviews and chose the Panasonic SD-YD250 for my first bread maker. I was not disappointed. While the instructions might not have been written by someone whose first language is English, they are pretty easy to understand, and the button options are very straight-forward. Cleaning is a snap. I've made 4 different breads with no problems (and I'm not a perfectionist when it comes to measuring). I do wish that there were more recipes included with the instructions, but I'm sure I'll find plenty on the WWW."
5,Best bread machine we have ever owned!,"I wanted to buy a new bread machine but had huge misgivings because of the problems we experience with other brands over 20 years ago. I did a fair amount of research and decided to go with the Panasonic SD-YD250 because of reviews and consumer ratings. Price played a big part too. We just purchased it the first part of January 2011 and since then (one month) I have baked 18 loaves of the most beautiful bread I have ever seen. We are very pleased with the machine and I would highly recommend it to anyone. We have made white bread, 100% Red whole wheat that I ground myself as well as White wheat and every loaf turned out wonderful. Texture and flavor as well as crust I feel was way beyond my past experience. This is a was really good move i.e. purchase for us."
5,good results!,Made the raisin bread and wholewheat bread and multigrains!I use Fleischmanns all natural yeast for the breadmachine and good quality flours and exact measuring helps.Not all recipes have the faster option and not all have the option to chose the colour of the crust.The book you get with the machine is clear. I would recommend this machine.
4,Great Machine,"I've owned this bread machine for almost 2 months and have made tons of bread with it. It's been a wonderful addition to my kitchen and my family enjoys the bread it makes. However, I have two issue. My first issue with the machine is that the sides and bottoms tend to get very dark if the bread is not removed immediately after the bake cycle is complete. My second issue, which may be endemic to all bread machines, is that the loaves come out misshapen making it difficult to use for sandwiches. Other than that, we love the machine. It's a very good product."
5,So far so good!,We've only had the bread maker a few weeks but so far our experience has been great. The bread is terrific. Nice and crispy on the outside with a wonderful texture on the inside. Panasonic has always made reliable products and so far this is the case with the breadmaker. If there is one drawback it would be that the express bake mode is a full 2 hours as compared with 1 hour for our previous model. However the wait is worth it as the bread is swell. It just takes a bit more planning and you can't try to bake a loaf for dinner on the spare of the moment. Otherwise the loaves are large enough that they last for a few days and even after a few days they bread is still delicious. Only time will tell if the bread maker will last longer than our previous model but for now we are totally pleased.
1,Broken within a year,"We got this bread maker as a Christmas present. Initially it did a great job of making bread. We had no problems, making a loaf of bread about once a week. But about 8 months in, the bread started to get smaller. At first we thought we had gotten something wrong in the content of the bread. We tried adjusting the recipe with no luck. Then we tried different yeast. That did not work. The bread just continued to rise less and less. By the time we realized that it was the bread maker, it was past the one-year warranty. Very disappointed that this product broke so soon."
3,First Time,This is the first bread maker I have ever used. It has been a challenge to get what I call a perfect loaf of bread.I am disappointed.
3,noisy but great bread,"The machine makes great bread but it becames noisy after 4 breads. It seems the bread canister could be a better fit. This looseness causes rattling noises. Otherwise, a good product."
5,Breadmaker,I got this breadmaker a few months ago and love it. It's so quiet compared to my old one and it can make loaves up to 2.5 lbs. We use our bread machine at least once a week sometimes twice. It's really easy to use and the bread that comes out is delicious. One word of caution though you do have to buy a scale to go with it unless you're sure you know how much 11/16 of a cup is on the measuring cup. It will make things easier if you buy the scale. The price is very reasonable from what I've seen and it seems to be of good quality. The only other thing is it does not have a viewing window but since you're really not supposed to open the bread machine anyway I don't see where that really matters. All in all it's a great product and I haven't any problems getting my bread to turn out.
2,Be warned,I bought this in January and it worked well until September. Then in the middle of a bread making cycle it somehow managed to move several inches so that it fell off the counter and was damaged beyond repair. There was no earthquake at the time. Panasonic said that this was not a machine malfunction. I conclude that the only safe place for it is on the floor.Before this I owned a Breadman for many years without trouble and only had to replace because I could not buy a new bread pan anywhere.
2,not the same quality as when it first came out,"I have had a Panasonic Bread maker since they first came out and I Love it!! This new machine is not the same. My daughter has tried 5 loves that didn't come out at all. The receipe book is in fractions of cups that don't make sense. The bread pan is not the quality of the older models. That is too bad because I have always told people that the Panasonic is the best bread machine, but I don't feel that way anymore. If mine ever breaks down, I will probably buy another brand."
2,Panasonic bread maker,"Iam very disappointed with this product.The display is difficult to read. The indicating arrows are so small thy are almost invisable.Even on the lignt setting,the crust is too dark.The bake times are too long(4&5)hours."
2,Reset problem,"I am only giving this machine 2 stars because the only way to reset it is to unplug it and wait one hour. It doesn't matter if it sits on your counter for a week, if you don't unplug it you will have to wait an hour. This is a huge uneccessary inconvience. Hey Panasonic, I know you can do better than this."
5,very effective,"I broke out the machine upon getting it and with minimal set up programmed it to make a loaf of whitebread for the morning. It came out perfect. This was something of a surprise since I live at over 5000' and usually have to adjust recipes (had to with my old bread machine). I have since also tried the french bread mode, and it came out great as well. It seems to be an excellent machine."
4,good bread,"Our daughter and son-in-law are well pleased with the Christmas gift of the Panasonic bread maker. Other than a bit smaller than usual whole wheat loaf, their other bread has been good."
5,Great bread machine,"I've been using this bread machine for a couple of years and it's great. Haven't had any problems, it's very quiet and has a good amount of features.The only downside, which is a problem with any bread machine, is the shape of the loaves. I really don't like that rectangular shape so I generally use the dough setting and bake the bread in the oven with a regular bread pan."
4,Panasonic Bread Maker,This my second of this model. The first lasted less than 2 years but paid for itself as it was used about 3 times a week. The quality of the bread and ease of use are really good. I'm just sorry it couldn't last a little longer.
4,Works as well as advertised,"First, this product arrived quickly and without any damage.After briefly reviewing the operating instructions, I decided to bake a loaf of bread from the recipies included in the instrucction manual. The quality of the bread was excellent,with uniform rising throughought the loaf. Crust color is adjustable through controls set when starting the loaf, this control also worked to perfection.My only objection to this (or any other breadmaker I have used) is that the loaf comes out super-sized. I personally would prefer a more modesty sized loaf, or failing that, a loaf that could be cut in half to produce normal sized slices.Further use of the machine using recipes from other sources produced excellent bread."
5,Very good product at a good price,"This item performs as described and was a very good price as deal of the day. The resulting breads have been very good, and not burned or overdone in any way. Raisin bread was very good, and will keep eyes open for gifts to young couples."
2,Don't make 'em like they used to!,I bought this machine to replace my old Regal machine which served me well for 15 years. The new machine is quite similar to the Regal with one HUGE difference... the motor that spins the kneading blade in this machine is pathetic. It can't even handle a simple white flour bread dough without stalling and smelling like overheating parts. I am expecting it to last about a year. How very disappointing.
3,"DAK, I miss you","The Panasonic does not have a fan to cool the bread - you have to be there to take it out. Sure, you can use the timer, but you still HAVE TO be there, and burn yourself in the process - it's too hot to handle! Many of the fancy settings (crust color, loaf size) only work with white bread, not if you choose multigrain or wheat. I'm trying to adjust, but I miss the old guy."
1,Half a Lump,"Good while it lasted, about 1.5 years. My option---pay for non-cost effective service, assuming the service center they directed me to would work on bread makers. NOT. More planned obsolescence for the ever-growing scrap heap?"
3,Breadmaker,"Received Panasonic SD_YD250 Bread Maker just as promised through Amazon.Called Panasonic to check which settings for Gluten Free bread and they said ""it doesn't have any Gluten Free settings."" We responded ""That's why we called, to determine which settings would work best!"" They finally said ""use any settings."" Their attitude suggested we shouldn't have bought their breadmaker?We tried the basic, quick cycle, dark crust settings with dry engredients in the bottom and the bread was good, but it didn't mix the engredients from the edge of the four bottom corners. We tried putting liquids in the bottom for the next loaf and bread was good but the four bottom corners weren't mixed well.With all their high reviews, plus their cost, we expected Panasonic to answer our Gluten Free question and for their breadmaker to mix better."
1,Disappointed!,"Sorry, but I am disappointed in the Panasonic bread maker. It was very quiet the first time I used it for a basic bread - because it wasn't doing anything! No kneading, just ""baked"" a pan of flour. The second round, it worked on the quick cycle. Next time it rested for two hours, never kneaded - stopped it and restarted it on basic and ended up with a lump of bread. Fourth round, tried making dough. It took four tries and eight hours. And the manual is very poorly written and confusing. It even contradicts itself by telling you to put the yeast in first and then tells you to put it in last. Did I get the wrong manual?!! Or just the wrong machine, for me at least."
3,bread maker,The bread machine arrived in a few days and was in good condition. I find it harder to program and much slower than my other bread makers. Also think a one month warranty is very short. Donna
5,Best bread machine,I have had this machine for over 3 years and still makes the best bread ever. Easy to use and clean and the only issues I have had have been pilot error...ME.
1,Bad shopping experience,"When this item was shipped to my home, the shipping boxes were fine but the machine was broken on the panel of the right hand side cover. This item was replaced but when I received the replacement, the shipping boxes were also fine, the bread machine was also broken on the lip cover. Have to return both. What a bad experience."
1,Automatic Yeast Dispenser? I Don't Think So!,"Purchased two Panasonic SD-YD-250 with the hopes that one of them would dispense yeast and raise some bread. No yeast dispense so you have a flat burnt loaf, yummy! Support not much of a help when they are located in India. If you purchase one keep your box because you will be sending it back which Amazon is kind enough to pick it up at no charge. So I will order a different bread maker and write a new review. You are much better off adding the yeast yourself and let the machine do the rest."
5,Bread Making Simplified,"I make bread twice a week with this bread maker. Instructions are easy to follow and the results, whether bread dough or a loaf, have been consistently excellent. The dough releases easily from the pan. The bread dough releases easily making pan cleanup a snap."
5,Great Bread Everytime,"I have tried other breadmakers, Mr. Breadman and Williams Sonoma store brand, and this is by far the best. Panasonic has done a great job with this product."
1,Bread Making,"My orginal machine was a Mr. BreadMaster. It was the first one I bought. Compared to the Panasonic Bread Maker, the bread was okay. The new machine was worth the price. It makes great bread with great ease"
2,The 2nd one was good,"I bought this for my wife and the original product that arrived was wobbly. One of the bottom pads was shorter than the others. We had to put a few cards under the pad or the thing would just about fly off the counter. The yeast dispenser did not work either. I returned it and got a new one that works great. It makes great bread and is overall a great bread maker, too bad not all of them would pass any kind of quality control."
1,disappointment,"I bought this machine after reading all the raves. The bread rises less than in our old Breadman, and often comes out slightly burned. I'm disappointed."
5,The best bread maker in the world,Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread MakerThe best bread maker in the world - enough said!
2,Good unit but received damaged,"I ordered this bread maker for my daughter and it arrived in an undamaged box but the unit has 2 distinct dents in the front (1 on both sides). It was a gift and I was not told, since she did not want to hurt my feelings, but now I have seen it. She has used it, but I am terrible disappointed."
3,Great machine~~~BUT,"I purchased this machine after my 20something Hitachi finally quit heating. The bread is absolutely the best from a bread machine. However, after the first two loaves, the machine began making a strange clattering noise when kneading. The bread was fine. I checked the machine over, saw nothing wrong, made two more loaves and dough for rolls. Still made the noise when kneading. Quite loud. Very reluctantly, I sent the machine back. Don't let my bad experience stop you from purchasing this machine. It makes the best bread and perhaps there was nothing seriously wrong with it. I just didn't want to take the chance."
5,WOW!,"This breadmaker is incredible! It bakes a perfect loaf everytime! It is easy to use. Cleans up like a dream.The only drawback is the bread tastes so good, you may gain weight! Yummmmmmm!"
1,Horrible!,I bought this because of all the excellent reviews! I've tried 3 basic recipes from the manual and none of them even mixed the ingredients. I made sure the blade and pan were seated properly but each one came out with ingredients clumped together and flour caked. I'm returning and buying another product. Not sure which one though. Very disappointed!
5,Best bread machine with no equal,"We ordered our breadmachine on line and it came with a cosmetic dent. We kept it anyway. The machine is amazing; you can not make a bad loaf of bread! Panasonic has figured out the bread machine. We have had experiences with a number of other ""name brand"" machines and none can come close to the success you can get from this machine. I would only recommend this one. The rest will end up in the top cupboard, along side your other slightly used gadgets. This will stay handy so you can have a fresh loaf in the morning. It takes all of about 60 seconds before you go to bed to prepare a loaf that comes out perfectly in the morning."
5,Great Product,"I love the Panasonic SD-YD250 Bread Maker. It makes wonderful loaves of bread every time. I have been on a bread making binge, taking loaves of bread to work so I can have an excuse to try another new recipe. No matter how much I change the bread recipes, they have all turn out wonderful.I previously owned a Toastmaster Bread machine that I never could make a good loaf of bread with. In conrast, this Panasonic Bread Machine continues to turn out one wonderful loaf after another. I can't say enough good things about this machine except: Thank you for allowing me to read other satisfied customer reviews!Enjoy!"
2,Dense Bread Burner,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. We have used it three times so far trying a variety of different whole wheat type loaves, so far all three have failed to rise properly and have been burnt. We have use other bread makers in the past, and have never had this consistent of a problem. We have tried cutting the expensive new whole wheat flour with unbleached regular flour. We have always use new yeast, but to no avail it seems to always come out extremely short, dense, and burned on the sides. We did use it to make pizza dough once, and that turned out okay so that's why I didn't just give it one star. I think the problem is in the yeast dispensing mechanism.Now since it has been use, and I bought it just over thirty days ago, I have to deal with the hassle of returning the product to Panasonic for a full refund. Amazon is only offering a partial refund.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,Learn your dry measure conversions,"Getting started was a breeze with this automatic bread maker. I was astounded to find that the dry measure for flour was in ounces. No conversion table from ounces to cups was anywhere to be found in the manual or on the website manual. The only stumbling block was figuring out what 14 3/4, 18 1/2 or 21 1/4 oz converts to in cups. This can be a major challenge if you're a perfectionist (which I am not) considering all the various flours and different densities. We are experimenting with 3 cups to start and still enjoying our 2nd bread machine even after an unnessary foray into the dark world of dry measure. weights."
2,Idiotic initial rest!,"This bread machine works ok, but adds 1-2 HOURS to the cycle with an ""initial rest"". We do a final rise and cook in a pan. We've been making bread with an old machine for years. You warm cold ingredients to room temp with warm water or the microwave. That takes under 5 minutes. Apparently people are too lazy to do this anymore, so the machine does it. It takes the machine 1-2 hours to do this. How ridiculous. If the shipping wasn't so bad, I'd send it back. I do gather that this rest is fairly common with newer machines, so another brand may not help. Could they at least add a setting to bypass this amazing waste of time? My old machine takes 1 hour 50 minutes to produce dough. This machine takes 3 hours 15 minutes, with no improvement in quality. If you are looking for a bread machine, ask specifically about this stupid rest crap."
4,Bread maker,Just great and even a 5 year old can make super bread!Just follow the thing to the T.The display is too small that's way gave it a 4 star
3,ACCESSORIES OVERPRICED!!!!!,"I love this bread machine. I've been using it consistently for about a year, making about 2-3 loaves a week. Unfortunately, the nonstick coating is coming off of the bread pan and the kneading paddle. I called Panasonic for the replacement parts. The total with the shipping would be $99.00. That's insane!!!! I'm going to buy a different bread maker. The parts are too overpriced."
4,GREAT--there's just one thing....,"I love the bread maker. I use it to make ALL the bread my family eats and each loaf is delicious. THE ONLY THING I would am not too happy about is that there are only 40 recipes and when I called customer service to see if they had additional recipes elsewhere they said they no longer provide additional recipes. I have tampered with some of my own recipes but because of the yeast pro dispenser and how the machine gets everything to the right temperature before it mixes, my own recipes aren't turning out as I'd like them too. Anyway, I'm doing more trial and error and I'm sure I'll find a solution. The recipes that are included have been great--I guess I'm just greedy because I want more!"
4,Perfect bread each time whether from mix or scratch,"This incredible bread machine will not let you down in front of your grandma, boss or kitchen-queen mom. I had the first model for about 12 years, lost it in a fire, replaced it with this one, and NEVER had a loaf of bad bread. It has a timer so you can set it ahead before going to work or bed. You cannot mess this up. It only requirees the mix, water and a sm packet of yeast whic is included! Instructions have recipes. Get it now. Your house/apartment will make people think you are the new Paula Deen."
1,Broke just after the warrantly ended,"This bread machine came highly recommended. I used it approximately once every 2 weeks (or less). It was great for a while, then one day I dumped in the ingredients as usual but got... floury water. It had just stopped working. I looked online and through the manual for some clue as to what to do, but found nothing. It was not worth shipping it back to NJ for repair, so now it's in the landfill. This bread machine was a disappointment and a waste of money."
5,Rock solid reliable,"I've had this machine for over three years, and use it at least twice a week. It took me a little while to get the amounts just right, but since then I've gotten a perfect loaf of bread every single time--and we're talking HUNDREDS of loaves here! AND, at a fraction of the price of those semi-stale, personality-challenged loaves at the supermarket. This is one of the best items I've EVER purchased, and it's going strong over 3 years later. Clean up is a breeze too, and setting it up at night takes maybe two minutes, with the reward of freshly-baked, still warm bread for breakfast. I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
1,Not at all happy,"I bought this machine at the end of October. I've only used it six times. This morning it died while mixing a basic batch of dough that my other machines easily mixed with no problems. I also found the digital panel was not that user friendly. Would not recommend, I had a better machine for half the price that lasted years."
4,nice maker,"I bought this bread maker last Thanksgiving. I love it, my kids too. Put all the ingrediants together, click the button, and wait. Awesome."
2,Maybe I got a lemon ...,"I read many reviews of bread machines, and decided on the Panasonic because so many people bought one, I think more units of this than any other. Well, I read the instruction book, selected a recipe, and started the process. The first stage is a Rest, where the ingredients are gently warmed. That went fine. The next step is Kneading, and that went fine, the dough looked good. After that, the machine bakes it, but mine did not get hot, so no baking. I tried again, but the machine just quit the first time, no heating. Well, that was both a surprise and a disappointment, but I took the dough out and baked it separately. I thought the recipe was very good, I used a 7 Grain flour mix, but the machine had to be returned. I don't feel too enthusiastic about ordering another one, I really didn't expect anything like this to happen."
1,"Broke after 5 loaves, terrible customer service","After making only 5 loaves of bread the ""D"" slot in the mix/kneed paddle was worn so badly the paddle had almost 90 degrees of free play on the motor shaft. I called customer service and after ten minutes of explaining they still could not understand my complaint. I was told I would have to bring my machine to the nearest repair center in New Jersey to have it serviced. I live in South Carolina. The Rep had no idea how far away they are from each other. They refused to send me a new paddle."
4,Panasonic Breadmaker,"The XL loaf was too big. The medium loaf is what I would call regular size. Unless you use Rapid Bake, it takes 4 - 5 + hours...a long time. Also it's a little noisier than my last bread machine. On the plus side, it's easy, bakes well and tastes great!"
5,Perfect!,This is a great bread machine. It makes perfect loaves every time. I had the earlier model of this bread machine for over 15 years and it never fails (except when you forget to put in the yeast!).
4,Great breadmaker - missing dough timer,"For the short time I've had this bread maker, it has functioned very well. I was sadly surprised that it does not allow for using the timer on the dough function. So if I want to only make dough, I have to be at the machine exactly 2.5 hours before I want the dough to be ready. Since I almost exclusively use my break maker for making dough, this was a huge disappointment. Otherwise, a good, sturdy machine."
3,Loaf of Brick,"It makes a loaf of whole wheat bread as hard as a brick, in size XL, L or M. I used to have the Zojirushi which was fine. I bought the Panasonic this time because it was a little cheaper than the Zo. Out of 7 times I used this Panasonic bread maker, once it failed to knead and came out all powderly."
4,A good usable machine.,"I have been satisfied with the Panasonic Bread Maker. I found the key board a bit confusing at first, but not a big problem. It seems to make consistently good bread. My greatest disappointment is that the instructions and recipes provided do not mention sour dough bread making."
5,Happy with Panasonic SD-YD250 Breadmaker and wiyAmazon,We could not be more pleased... in every way. We reccomend this product and Amazon to all.
5,Excellent buy !,Excellent product ! the wifes bread is amazing and costs only about twenty cents a loaf.well worth the money !
5,great value for the money,The Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker is easy to use and the quality of bread is consistently excellent. Not only do the recipes that come with the machine's instructions work well but favorite recipes that I have long used to bake bread the conventional way also work well without any significant adaptation. I strongly recommend this machine to people who love fresh baked bread but do not always have the time to bake their own.
4,Wonderful for now!!!,"Just got my Panasonic last week and immediately made two loaves -- one basic white, which was beautiful (rose a little high, but is more bread a problem? And the clean up was easy.) and tasted SO good. Could taste the yeast and was yummy. A lot like my grandmother's homemade bread. Only problem was that my daughter burrowed a hole through the soft middle! Guess I'll have to watch her. The wheat loaf was not so good. Did not rise and ended up as a too dense rock. Tasted okay, but I used blackstrap molasses and the irony flavor of the molasses was too strong, my fault. Next time I will use plain old molasses. I think the wheat loaf would be better with more milk/water or less flour or perhaps a combo of wheat and bread flours. Anyway, we are pleased with the overall outcome (my fam LOVES white bread and I never buy it) and I can't wait to try more recipes! Like cinnamon rolls and monkey bread and chocolate bread!!! MMMMM!! Along with the good-for-you-stuff too, of course! ;o)"
1,Hope it does not need to be repaired!!,"This bread faker was great for the first 3 loaves or so,then the non rising problems started.I tried everything Panasonic suggested,all new ingridients, plane white loaf - store mixed ingridients... nothing worked.They gave me a list of repair places to send it to(you pay the shipping 17.00.both ways)I sent my machine to Lake Electronics in NY.to be fixed, well lo and behold it's been 5 months and umpteen phone calls later,they are still waiting on the RIGHT parts to be sent, appears there has been a design change in the circuit board and these parts are being shipped from India or some other country.I am looking for another more reliable machine."
3,Works as to be expected,"This bread machine does as it claims to do. Nothing more and nothing less, as of yet. I bought this for my English hubby who had a similar model in the UK. He is adjusting to the US measurements but I am sure that frustration will wear off soon. We have made a couple loafs and they all tasted good (not great, just good). Don't expect to be wowed but Panasonic is a good brand"
1,Burned bread - used for 4 loaves,"I bought this breadmaker for Christmas. I've made 4 loaves and EVERY one was scorched, dark, and hard outside. My Welbilt, bought for about $39, lasted years and made good bread. This is such a disappointment! From reading the reviews, it's not worth sending it in for repairs since Panasonic doesn't seem to care to repair. It would be in their best interest to just replace the bad ones. I'll not buy another Panasonic anything. This is just awful. Going back to find another Welbilt for under $50. At least it made wonderful bread!"
2,From bread to bricks in 3 months,"I ordered this breadmaker on Oct. 8 and initially it worked well until January 18, 2010 it began failing. It was used two to three times per week since October 13 when I received it. This past week it began making smaller and smaller loaves with hard crusts....bread bricks!! I knew the recipe and could almost make it blindfolded but because this was happening, I dug out the instruction book and tried to find a reason for it. I bought new yeast (thought perhaps that was the problem), bought fresh bread flour, measured and remeasured the water, the temperature of the water (lukewarm), etc. but the results were the same....smaller hard crusted loaves each smaller and harder than the previous one. I purchased this breadmaker because of the glowing reviews that it received but unfortunately it appears that I received a lemon."
4,Would buy product again,"I have had this for about a month, bread comes out good, but its just a little too loud when its kneeding the dough."
4,Good machine,"I had an old Zojirushi machine that finally died after 15 years. A new one cost $215 so I looked at other options. This machine looked best when I had read many reviews. The one odd thing is that in my old machine, I put in all the ingredients at once.With this machine, there is a little round hole on the top of the lid that you put the dry yeast in and after the pan has warmed the other ingredients (this takes about 45-60 minutes), the machine bangs loudly three times to dispense all the yeast into the pan. I was startled the first time it happened and am not sure I'd make bread during the night (for morning eating) with this noise.The cycle digital readout is a bit small and not very intuitive, but works fine once you get the hang of it.Otherwise it's a great machine."
4,Great way to make bread,This machine makes delicious bread and is very easy to use and to clean. My 15 year old son now makes all the bread we eat. Two small flaws: if you leave the bread in the machine too long it burns. The stirring arm makes a small slanted hole in the bread.
4,Maybe good,"I had a the cheapest unit made by Breadman which lasted me over five years and I make at least one loaf a week. This one looks to be better built but takes longer to produce the same loaf. It took me several tries to get the loaf done correct and had to change my recipe every time. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is the bread doesn't come out level on top, not even close."
2,Great - At First,Superior bread maker. For about 2 years. Then... the paddle and shaft ceased up and good luck finding anyone with parts. Even the Parts Ordering page on Panasonic's web site is screwed up. This was a superb product when made in Japan; now junk from China. Like everything else from China... junk. Beware.
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought the Panasonic SD-YD250 from an Amazon distributor, Zeemo Digital. I used it 4 times. On the 5th time I plugged it in, and instead of the timer reading 0:00 it reads 4:00 and none of the Control Panel-display functions work - except START/STOP. I called Panasonic and am furious. Because it is over one month they will not replace it...I have to ship it to their authorized service person somewhere in OHIO!!! I will NEVER BUY PANASONIC AGAIN - to not replace something or give money back when it is in pristine condition and the control panel failed---OUTRAGEOUS this product is JUNK"
1,"Broke after 15 uses, no customer service","The kneading blade broke after 15 uses. When i contacted Panasonic for a replacement, they referred me to a ""service center"" instead of sending me a new blade. Just think about this: do they think I should take off a day from work to drop it off and a day to pick it up? You must be kidding me!This is likely the last Panasonic appliance or device I will ever buy.Update: the ""service center"" I was referred to does not even give you the option to speak to a human. Beware, you are buying an appliance essentially without warranty service option!"
1,SD-YD250 stopped working after 4 months,"I was very happy with the machine at first. but after 4 months it suddenly stopped working. the Panasonic customer service automatically send me to the repair facility. when i called them, they say that i have to bring the machine. it will take me an hour to get there."
4,Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker,"Easy and affordable,get your own recipe book. The one that comes with the purchase is not very helpful or inspiring."
4,not quite as advertised,"I only use this machine for making dough, so I am uncertain whether my comment will apply to people who use it for making breads. I found that after making dough in the machine my bread did not taste as good as it had with my old machine, a Hamilton. So, I ignored Panasonic's instructions, put the liquid in first, did not use the yeast dispenser, took the dough out early (because the dough cycle has a really long waiting period after all the kneading is done), and voila perfect dough and perfect bread--all the time.I am very happy with the Panasonic now. Plus, the extra deep pan in the machine means that the dough does not get all over the bottom."
4,"great , better with a few tweeks","Got it on gold box flash deal so price was great. first breadmaker . as a guy instructions were glanced at and used a box mix kit. the end result was great! a loaf that was bakery quality first time. learned about ""dry milk"" and ""breadmaker yeast"" . the thing just works perfect!only semi cons are the book does not ""flow"" well but if you take alot of time it is ok. the lcd could use a backlight. the bread done chime is not loud enough..all in all it is very nice and would recommend to all.I will update in about 10 pounds.."
4,Still trying out recipes. But Great..,It is very easy to use. I am trying different types of bread. The whole wheat makes a very tough crust..haven't tried anything else. It is bigger than I thought but fits nicely under the top cupboard on the counter. My grand kids love the homemade bread and are even eating whole wheat..Yeah..
5,Panasonic Breadmaker,We've had an Hitachi bread machine for 14 years and it was great-when it gave out we bought a Breadman that lasted 2 years. We have ordered 2 other machines that grossly overcooked the bread but the Panasonic we just got has been great!! It makes a great loaf of bread and we are very pleased with it.
3,Disappointed,"Even though this machine makes 3 different size loaves, the loaf is still large when you choose medium because of the size of the inset. You also have to remove the bread before the timer goes off or you will have very dark crust even when you chose light crust. Would have prefered to know the size before purchase."
1,Don't buy this machine,"This machine doesn't work as described in the directions which means my particular unit is defective or the product is badly designed. The size/darkness buttons don't function in any order after using menu, or select buttons. The inability to reset the machine without unplugging it for a long time is also a big problem, and would have been easy to add to the controls. Compared to my Regal bread machine from the mid 90s this machine is extremely buggy and hard to use. Don't purchase this unless you like to be annoyed."
2,flying cloud,"Emits an odor of cooking metal when operating, that might be entering the cooking bread.Bread was crisp and dark on the outside, dense and raw in the middle. Was returned to Amazon."
2,"Good at first, then not good at all","I bought this breadmaker about a year ago. It worked great for a while on both pizza dough and regular breads, and then I couldn't get the pizza dough to work at all. When I told cust. service the heating element wasn't working, they told me the pizza dough setting doesn't use heat. Not believing them, I took it to a authorized repair shop. After waiting almost three months for it to be fixed, they said a control panel had to be replaced.Again, it worked fine at first, and now it doesn't work again. I've swapped out my flour, yeast, everything, and to no avail. I borrowed a bread maker, used the same ingredients in each, and made pizza dough at the same time. The borrowed one worked, the Panasonic did not. I'm now out of luck and will have to buy a new one, but not a Panasonic. I really want to like it since I had some good results, but I'm ready to take a sledge hammer to it every time my pizza dough doesn't work and have to come up with another plan for dinner."
1,Don't leave it unattended!,"You would think that a bread machine with a timer option is meant to work without being watched every minute, but not this one. The first time I used it, it jumped off the counter and crashed to the floor, broke and is now useless. I can only imagine that it jumped around while it was kneading the dough (unlike the last machine I had, this one has only one paddle) and worked its way over the edge of counter. What poor engineering!"
2,Beater came apart,I had an old bread machine that worked great. Slap the ingredients in and always made an excellent loaf (except when I forgot the yeast one time). This one is cranky and takes a much more precise measuring which is not for me. The beater came loose and I can't for the life of me figure out what happened to it. Called tech support and they promised to send me one. Never got it. Thought Panasonic had a better reputation. SO I limp along with the bread machine but its not working properly. Disapointed.
4,Almost perfect,"A very good bread machine. I've tried about 6 loaves so far and initially I thought that the bread came out a little dry and over browned. The light crust setting would make a loaf that medium / dark crust. After some experimentation I've found that the keep warm function is to blame. If I take the bread out as soon as it's done, the crust is just right. Also if I take out the bread 10 min before, the bread is very moist. The whole wheat setting and the basic settings create very nice loaves with good texture and flavor. I would give the machine 5 stars if I could adjust the bake cycle shorter by 10 min."
5,A great product replaced by a super one!,"Met all of my expectations...and more. Like the 3 loaf size option. My previous maker was a Universal (Panasonic) Had it many years and was afraid I would not be able to replace it when the paddle mechanism literally fell apart. Was very happy when I found it online..ordered it and received it 6 days later. All in all, I am a happy bread maker once again!"
3,A bread lover's review,"Atkins diet? Never heard of it. I have had this machine for a month and made several loaves. I have had no issues with the machine, it functions fine. It is silent for most of the 4 or 6 hour baking cycle, except during kneading. When the blade runs in one direction, a pleasing mechanic hmmm is heard, when that blade reverses, a sharp clack is heard for each revolution. If you sleep near your kitchen, over-night bread might be an issue. As for the bread, it cannot compare with hand made loaves, it does not acheive the thick crust or deepness of baking that a baker can. BUT it is good bread, much better than a grocery store loaf. The crust has character and the center is light and chewy, it's best for sandwiches. I make lunch everyday for may family, so bread was something I always had to buy, so this unit has helped me out very well. I will try the ""dough only"" mode and make bagettes, that might be closer to what I was hoping for."
4,"Cool, clean and quiet","Pros:It doesn't get flour all over the kitchen like I used to do when I made bread by hand. Its as cool to operate as a slow cooker, so I can bake bread in the summertime here in the south without overloading the air conditioner. It works great with regular yeast or with the sourdough starter, and its pretty user friendly to operate. It makes the best sourdough bread I've had since I left the west coast!I wish it had:A way for me to tell it ""knead 10 minutes and then turn yourself off"" so I didn't have to hover over it when I'm doing the sourdough.Overall, I love it."
3,Panasonic Bread Maker - it's ok,"I had a Panasonic bread maker that I used for many years and it finally quit working so I purchased this one as a replacement. I can say the old one worked much better and was easier to use than this one. The recipe measurements are odd. The bread function works fine; but, I have yet to get the recipe for the dough (dinner rolls) to come out ok. Not sure if the recipe ratios are off or what as the rolls do not raise much and are very dense. I do like the option of different sized loaves of bread."
1,Dead after 20 months. Limited warranty: need to buy another bread machine..,"It was very good until it worked. After 20 months it stopped working. The warranty covers only one year. We contacted Amazon and Panasonic, we should ship it to a repair center to have an estimate. The cost of the electric motor alone is approx $80, plu shipping, labor, estimate so at the end pretty close to buying a new unit. It is a shame since this is an expensive machine and there should be a better coverage/assistance."
4,Worth the money.,"I bought this product specifically to make gluten-free bread. I've used several different brands of bread mix in the machine and it has done well with all of them. My only complaint is that the instructions are slightly less than clear, but that may be just me! It's a good machine and well worth the money."
3,A noisy machine,"The breadmaker was chosen after trying other companies' products over the years and reading that this was the best rated. We have so far used it twice. The instructions are clear and the finished products ( a white loaf and a brown loaf) have been very good. However, it takes much longer than other breadmakers we have used, up to an hour longer. But more notable is the noise. It is extremely noisy as it prepares the dough. It sounds as if the internal container is not properly set resulting in quite disturbing sounds. Perhaps it will mute with age."
5,Whole Family loves it...great bread maker period...,We were not a bread eating person until we got this bread maker a month ago. Now my wife bakes every day and we eat fresh break in all meals we eat. My daughter loves the fresh bread. In short we are happy with this purchase. Just an advice “Do buy Square Trade 3 years warranty with it for peace of mind even Panasonic recommends it.Thanks!
1,Weak Motor?,"It seems to me that the motor is very weak. I've baked several loaves now and every time the motor labors quite a bit until the paddle stops moving and all that is heard is the whine of the motor. The first time I just assumed that I had not put in enough water, so I added more. But since then I've measured very carefully - even switching to measuring the flour by weight instead of trusting the measuring cup. Same result. So I'm confident that my measurements are accurate and it's unlikely that the supplied recipes are all wrong (14.75 oz whole wheat flour to 1.25 cups water).By the way, the machine arrived dented, but I let it pass. However if the motor is weak then I feel really disappointed with this purchase. From my experience with motors, a motor that is held back and not allowed to rotate will have a very short life."
2,Counterfeit Breadmaker?,We purchased this Panasonic SD-YD250 from Amazon.com LLC in October 2012 and were happy with the low price of $109.98 with free shipping. So far we have only used it to make bread dough for pizza a couple time. We were surprised how loudly it squeaked. This unit replaced our previous breadmaker that we'd had for about 15 years. Squeaking from that old model was minimal. The Panasonic SD-YD250 squeaking is very obtrusive and would suggest to me to be a defect.Recently I went to register the product at the Panasonic site and found that the manufacturer's label on the back of the breadmaker has NO SERIAL NUMBER. This seems very suspicious and makes me wonder whether it is a genuine Panasonic product.
5,good,"great and price is right,made a little noise but was good bread,and i will be eating a lot of home baked bread lol"
5,great machine,The bread maker was great and had a good price. It made a white bread as well as whole wheat bread really nicely. I will try to make croissant next!
4,Wonderful breadmaker,"Makes some wonderful and tasty bread (unlike most cheaper brands some of my friends own.) The timer works well and allows you to get some fresh bread every morning. Just too bad that it has a tendency to mash up fruits (such as dryed apricots) even if you add when you are asked to, but it works well with grains."
1,Burnt Bread,"I purchased this machine with high hopes. The first few loaves turned out well. After three weeks, the loaves and the bread bucket began to get scorch marks and the bread too had black marks. I was getting nervous that this was going to cause a fire.Panasonic pre-paid to have this machine sent for repair after I used this machine for three weeks. The repair shop kept it for 10 weeks. When it was returned, they did not replace the burned bread bucket, and it was still scorched. After baking bread again, the burning was getting worse on the bread, and it looks like burnt toast on the crust. Panasonic is sending the machine back for repair again. It has been four months now, and I have only had this machine for use for three weeks. After it is repaired this time, I am going to put it up for sale on amason.com and purchase a Zorishee...or however it's spelled."
1,Spoke too soon,"I originally gave this 5 stars. It was great at first but the non-stick coating on the pan and blade started to peel off in 3-4 months. I contacted Panasonic and they said I had to purchase replacement parts because they were considered consumable. I asked if they meant because I was literally consuming the metal that was flaking off into my food? They sent me replacement parts and the same thing happened and this time I noticed in 2-3 months. I used this machine moderately to make pizza dough only - nothing baked, ever. The unit is completely unusable. Bottom line, I paid $130 for a bread maker that lasted about three months."
5,Best!!!!!!,"Been using it for 5 years now, have baked well over 1000 breads, every kind and still works as good as new. Do i need to say more? Panasonic rocks!!!!!"
5,Easy to Use Bread Maker,"I've never used a bread maker before and was really nervous about selecting the right one. This has been so easy to use and I've adapted all sorts of recipes. I would definately recommend it. I was disapointed that all the recipes that came with the machine call for powdered milk and most call for butter and I don't use dairy products. The reason I wanted to make my own bread was to avoid certain ingredients. But is hasn't been a problem. I use canola or olive oil instead of butter and have found lots of recipes on the web that work just fine. I've made at least 2 dozen loaves so far and haven't had a ""flop."""
4,Excellent bread maker,"I bought this bread maker after reading all the reviews. Every single bread that we've made with this machine has turned out absolutely perfect. I know that some people mentioned that you need a scale to make perfect bread. Actually, we don't have a scale, and yet the bread comes out perfect. The only reason I am not giving it a five star rating is because it arrived with one of the little rubber feet shorter than the rest by 1mm, so it wobbled until I put a folded paper towel under it. I called Panasonic customer service, and the lady was very nice and said they would send me a rubber foot. That was nearly a month ago, and I still haven't received anything. But, I suspect that it's a fluke, and in view of the fact that the machine performs so well as a bread maker, I think it deserves five stars."
5,Awesome,"Based upon the reviews of several machines, I purchased the Panasonic. My first loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread just finished, and the look and smell of the loaf is superb. The machine is quietand easy to use. I would definitely recommend the Panasonic. It is well worth the price."
1,NEVER GOT IT,"I don't know how good this breadmaker is because it arrived damaged - it was shipped back and I WAS NEVER SHIPPED A REPLACEMENT! Amazon records show I WAS NEVER SHIPPED A REPLACEMENT, but they said because too much time had gone by I was SOL!! BAD BAD JOB AMAZON!!!!"
2,better bread,if you want the best bread of your life and you want to no how to make it .super easy and just a few simple secrets that nobody knows[...]
1,false advertising of product,"I checked on the Panasonic web site and found the Panasonic bread maker listed for $144.95. Amazon lists it as a $300 machine and then lists it as though marked down considerably. I think that is false advertising. I did buy the machine from Amazon as a Christmas present. I have not tried it as yet, but because of false advertising I have given it a single star."
2,Unsatisfied,I grind my own wheat and I could not get my wheat bread to raise. I made several different changes in recipt. Nothing would work. I bot a different machine and it works great.
1,Bread Machine needs improvement,"I bought this bread machine when my old one had a leak in the pan and could not be fixed. This machine does not appear to have enough power in the motor to mix the bread. It came out with a very lumpy, less than nice loaf. It looked as though it had not mixed the ingredients thoroughly. I cannot recommend this machine as it does not produce a loaf that is worth eating. It was very dense even though we used the exact recipe which had always produced perfect results in the past. After the second failure with making bread, we packed it up and sent it back. We have used another brand of machine for years and decided that this was worth a try. It was NOT worth it!"
5,Perfect,"Made bread in this bread maker for the first time, the bread came out perfect. It had a nice golden crust with moist, tasteful bread. I see a lot of crazy reviews on these type of machines and believe fully that most bad reviews are due to operator error. Reading all the directions and following the measurement to the word is a must if you want perfect bread from any machine."
1,Good While It Lasted (12 uses),"Did a lot of comparing before I bought the Panasonic to replace our last bread machine which lasted about ten years. Finally settled on the Panasonic because of the great reviews. What the reviews don't focus on is that there is a real weak link with this machine. At the bottom of the pan holder there is a ceramic part that holds the heating element in place. That part broke after using the machine about a dozen times and just after the machine was out of warranty. The part costs just under five dollars -problem is I've been unable to find the part. I've read that Panasonic knows this part breaks with some frequentcy so why is the part hard to find?I think if more people actually looked in the bottom of the cavity they would probably see the part was cracked or completely broken through. For this reason, I can't recommend this product."
3,great bread; godawful noise,This breadmaker makes great bread without adjusting the recipe. (I live ataltitude.) The bread rises higher than any of my previous breadmakers. It locks and unlocks easily without the fear of burning oneself. The bread comes out of the pan easily and with little effect from the paddle. It is impossible to use this machine on the delayed cycle at night because I can hear the pounding of the dough as it is flipped around by the paddle. This is very disappointing because I bought this machine because it was reviewed as being very quiet. I've contacted Panasonic; I got suggestions that were silly. They did give me the address of a repair place that is about an hour away. I shouldn't have to get a month-old machine repaired--if indeed it needs repair. Maybe it's just a noisy machine.
3,"It's so, so.","I had the older version of this bread maker; I used it for 13 years, every other day, until the pan wore out, the machine itself was fine. It had a smaller pan, almost a square bottom as I recall. I could set it up and come back when the whole wheat cycle was finished; perfect bread every time.This newer version has a larger pan with a rectangular bottom shape. Unless I push the dough down about an hour and a half before the end of a whole wheat bread cycle, the bread comes out in odd shapes. I'm a bit disappointed. I don't wake up to fresh bread like I did with the old machine; who needs weird looking bread for breakfast?This machine bakes fine but it needs some personal intervention to get a decent looking loaf. I only make whole wheat bread."
5,Great gift,Purchased this as a gift and wife loves it makes bread all the time. I mean all the time. Nice for us to try all kinds of differnent recipies. Had for a couple yrs now and still loves it and lots of bread coming out of it.
4,Good choice,I had to replace my bread machine and decided that I wanted a horizontal loaf instead of the vertical loaf I had previously. I do enjoy that but was a little surprised that it was still a little odd shaped espescially when making large loaves.I do not like the recipe book that came with it. I actually still use most of the recipes from my old machine's book. The recipes in the Panasonic book recommend weighing your ingredients for measurement so the recipes are listed that way. I don't weigh ingredients as I don't have a scale and don't really want to buy one. And I didn't like how the couple of recipes I made from the book turned out. My old recipes work great though!The other draw back from my previous machine (GoldStar) is that the cycles are all just a bit longer with the Panasonic. I have gotten used to that but still a bit disappointing.Overall a quality machine though.
4,"Good, but comes with a surprise","This is the third bread maker I've owned. I rarely bake bread in the machine, using it primarilty to save my time by making only dough. Other bread makers I've had would complete the dough process in about 1 1/2 hours. The least amount of time for the dough cycly is 2:15 which is for a basic white bread. I make multi grain which takes 3:20. To bake a large loaf of multi grain the time is near 5 hours. I find this extreme. The reason for the excessive time is that the very first cycle is a ""rest"" cycle of about 1 hour to stabalize the temperature of all ingredients. Maybe this is a good thing though I've made bread successfully for years without this step. Still, the results from this machine are very consistent, more so than other machines I've used. Perhaps they know something I don't, I just get impatient with the time. If you are new to bread making, this is a good quality maker that has had some thought put into it."
4,Still baking away,"Been working great for over 2 years. The only complain I have is that the ""light"" bake setting isn't as light as I'd like it to be."
5,"Used only once, but had to write","Made our first loaf last night and it came out incredibly good. We've had bread from other bread machines, but something about this bread is special. I'm giving it 5 stars on how the bread came out.. however, I will say that the machine inside had some scratches and some debris from the factory maybe? Not too reassuring knowing that it was built in China (what else is new?).. But the bread (even without adding dry milk powder as the recipe suggests), came out fantastic, fluffy, light, with a beautiful golden crust.. If it lasts, this could easily be our favorite kitchen device."
4,it's good.,"This product is good for my family, especially for my child. I can bake fresh bread anytime for her without any hard work. Also, I'm satisfied with the quality of this product."
1,Broken out of the box,"The yeast dispenser did not work on the first loaf. Panasonic was of no help on the phone. They blamed me and my yeast. Suggested I ruin another loaf of bread, then chase around town looking for a repair shop. Thank goodness for Amazon, I shipped it back and will let Amazon deal with Panasonic. I replaced this purchase with a Breadman. The reviews for this unit come in two varieties: people love it or they have a problem. Panasonic will not fix their problems and they end up writing a poor review. I foolishly hoped to get a working machine, but when I had a problem, I was glad I had bought it from Amazon. My daughter had a similar problem with high dollar Panasonic wide screen LCD TV. I am through with Panasonic."
2,Somewhat dissatisified,"When we first got this machine(less than one month ago) the loaves came out ok. A little funny looking but good bread. We tried making the pizza dough and when it was ""ready"" it came out watery. Would have been much easier and less sloppy to do it by hand. Now, the bread collapses and the paddle gets stuck in the bread. Seriously considering returning it if I don't get answers. (There was nowhere to contact seller after product was delivered) Also, I read that the replacement paddle is $30.00!"
3,Panasonic bread machine,"Te price is comparable to other brands on the market. The bread loaf come out exactly as promised. The only thing I would have really liked to see on this machine is the beeper in between cycles. There are times you want to add special ingredients and there is nothing to remind you when to do that. This is one feature that I think is important to have especially for busy people. It has meet my expectation on performance. I recommend to those of you buying a bread machine, make sure you get the one the beeps in between cycles and at the end of baking."
1,"Poor reliability, potential fire hazard","As a breadmaker, it worked fine. But, a ceramic piece holding the heater element broke after using it for two months. With this ceramic piece broken, the heater has nothing to rest on, except the bottom of the unit, and can be a fire hazard. Look out for that. Poor design, and should be recalled."
5,Great machine!,"I am one of those who had a crappy machine before (Regal Kitchen Pro) so researched this machine to death. The best bread so far is the basic white. I did get a kitchen scale off of E-bay to measure my flour which is so much more accurate than measuring cups. Also highly recommend the Cuisinart CEK-40 electric knife to slice your bread. This Panasonic is a super machine, so stop reading about it, buy it and get it over with. Alice"
2,a real disappointment,"My machine worked just fine -- twice. It's amazingly quiet and made good bread. The third and fourth times I used it, my loaves didn't rise well. The fifth time, after making sure I was measuring correctly, I checked the temperature of the first rising cycle. It was not heating at all. Panasonic will not refund my money nor replace my machine. They only will repair it if I bring it to their shop -- 100 miles away. Or I can mail it at my expense, and it must be insured -- at my expense.I gave it two stars, because it does make good bread, if it works, but if not, you're pretty much out of luck."
3,Making good bread but some parts got broken very soon.,"Sorry from the beginning, not a native speaker.This machine makes great bread, but after using it for a week, we noticed that an yeast disposer doesn't work anymore. It made a noise when it was suppose to release yeast, but it wouldn't open. I made a call to Panasonic customer support and have got an advise that I should clean it. The repair shop located in another state. So we opened the machine and it turned out that some pieces got disconnected and were easily connected again by my husband. It was much harder to get the lid in place after all. Then after a few months the ceramic holder inside the machine which holds heating element got broken into two pieces. So now the heater just laying on the bottom on one side. It doesn't seem cause any problems with making bread though. We didn't hit the machine or heater itself, I have no idea why it broke."
3,Have used several times,"Having trouble with settings, crust too dark, cannot set crust correctlyBooklet not informative enoughGenerally easy to userating requirement too long"
2,Didn't last a year.,"Everything started great. The bread maker performed as expected. However we have noticed that, not quite a year later, the bread isn't rising. We have done everything to adjust the recipes: add more water, add more flour, add more yeast, buy new yeast, but nothing we do makes the loaf rise and bake to perfection. The result is usually small, very heavy, dense loaves of bread that don't fully cook on the inside. We aren't using rapid bake. Just the normal basic/white cycle. Very disappointing! I haven't seen an XL loaf for months even though we are using enough ingredients for an XL loaf and the correct baking cycle."
5,Great breadmaker!!,"This is a superb breadmaker! I had a Breadman Pro before, and this just knocks the spots off it. It's super quiet, has a neat feature for adding yeast AFTER the rest period, and just makes the best bread I have ever had. Even the paddle is better - thinner and more frictionless, so the hole created in the bottom of the bread is barely noticeable. Great product."
1,Disappointing,I was looking for a replacement for my Panasonic bread machine which I have used for over 20 years. It still works but it is starting to slip a little when kneading. I looked a long time before I found this machine and was excited to receive it. It worked once. On the second time it quit. I have waited long past warranty expiration to contact the company so I am not expecting a resolution. I hope my first bread machine is more indicative of Panasonic than my second. I could no longer recommend them.
2,Blade fits shaft very loose,"I bought this bread maker 10 days ago. I tried out this machine 4 times. The quality of bread is good, but the blade fits shaft very loose. During the kneading, consistent clank noise comes out and it sounds like the blade would come off the shaft. I am wondering if this is normal."
3,"Great recipe book, but not durable","We make our own bread at least once a day. After less than 4 years, this break machine stopped mixing the bread: the paddles simply would not turn. A new motor cost $50 through our local Panasonic branch, so we decided to buy a Zojirushi bread machine instead. Hopefully it will be more durable. If there are any readers out there who know of an industrial-strengh bread machine (one that can make loaves _daily_ consistently for more than 4 years) I would love to hear recommendations. Otherwise, I recommend this machine, but only people who need loaves once a week or so."
3,shopping cat,"The machine seems a good one but arrived with a broken part, a small piece holding the burner. Service/responding was a little slow - got it before the New Year but now still waiting for the replacing part."
4,Just love it,"I use this at least once a week. It makes everything so easy. We live in Panama City, Panama and the bread here is not what we are used to. I can make all kinds of bread so easily now. Good machine! !"
5,Love this breadmaker!,This is a great product if you want to make your own bread but don't have a lot of counter space. It can make pizza dough too. Great product.
3,Disappointing Dough Options,"I'm sending mine back. If you like to shape and bake your own whole wheat or French loaves, the Panasonic is not your machine. It does not have special French or Whole Wheat Dough cycles. What's more, there is a long rest period (30-60 minutes) at the beginning of the regular dough cycle, making it impractical to use the common ""work around"" for French/Whole Wheat dough of running it through two regular dough cycles. Another problem is the automatic yeast dispenser; it is too small to hold all the yeast called for in some of my 2.5 lb whole wheat recipes. I think it holds about three teaspoons if you really pack it in. Like all bread machines I've seen, it lacks a timer for dough options; why is that? Wouldn't it be great to get up Sunday morning with the bagel dough ready to go?? I expected a more versatile machine for the price."
3,Panasonic SD-350 Bread Maker,"""Crust color selection"" is only available on the ""basic"" settings and is not available on the ""whole wheat"" setttings. Since I make mostly whole wheat breads, I don't have this option. Consequently the loaf is way too done for my taste. The only thing I can do is take the loaf out early."
5,Battered and dented but still going strong!,"This Bread machine arrived with a dent in the side thanks to the stupid merchant (not Amazon) packing it with just its original (thin) cardboard box. Kept it as it was only cosmetic and still worked fine (OK, couldn't be bothered to return it)Last Christmas we had a full house so I set it to make a loaf for early in the morning. We don't know what happened, but somehow it must have ""walked"" across the countertop and fallen onto our tile floor. The resulting crash caused some drama when several people thought that the noise was Granny falling over in the shower :) We're still not sure what caused it to 'walk' as it had never done this before and hasn't since - mischievous Christmas spirits perhaps...Anyway, the lid is now permanently detached and there are quite a few more dents - but it still works fine! I do have to wait till the yeast adding mechanism has done its thing to sit the lid back on, but it bakes just as well as before."
5,Easy to use and reliable,"I am new to making homemade bread in a machine. I ordered this one, not knowing anything about it at all, and after 1 use I had it figured out. It is so easy! I make our sandwich bread in it so I use it at least 3 to 4 times a week and it always yields a perfect looking, delicious loaf of bread. I don't know ANYTHING about bread machines so I can't tell you if this one is fancy or loud or slow or whatever - all I know is that it is easy and reliable and I am glad I bought it!"
5,A great Bread maker,"I never thought I could make such good bread. I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and I put it to work right away. I have tried several recipes from the book that came with the machine, and found them to be really good. I am making multigrain bread this week. I have added sunflower seeds, flax, oats, and other good for you things. I usually always use molasses for the sweetener. My family loves that we have fresh bread to wake up to in the morning. The timer idea is great and very easy to understand. The round part on the top is for your yeast so you never have to worry about the right time to add it. It really does it all for you. I love this machine and hope that I never get tired of the fresh bread it makes. To make it easy, I have everything in one area of the cupboard so that it only takes minutes to pull it out and make the bread."

5,Publicity Primer for all Professionals,"Getting Publicity is a primer for any business owner, and I wish I had found it at the beginning of my career rather than mid-stream. With powerful tips such as evaluating your PQ (publicity quotient), creating a publicity planner, and setting publicity goals, it's a must-read for all professionals. After reading Getting Publicity, I felt that I had just completed a comprehensive coaching session with a public relations team, but well within the means of my modest entrepreneurial budget. Reading Getting Publicity will start you on your path to success with the media and help you achieve the recognition you and your company deserve."
2,"Great delivery, product iffy","It definitely works if you aren't planning on using it for organic chemistry. It cannot perform chair flips well at all mainly due to the fact that the single bonds get very stuck inside the atom pieces and don't move easily if at all. So basically, I gave up on the modeling kit for the purpose that I bought it for (O-chem) and then tried using it for inorganic to help with identifying symmetry operations.Delivery though was very good. 5-star on that. Came on time as expected, no delays."
4,Chemistry Tutor,"This is an excellent way to help kinesthetic learners master the structures of simple and complex molecules. Boys particularly enjoy the snapping, twisting, turning and experimentation. Letting them put the parts together and then getting them to name what they constructed randomly often brings the, ""Aha!!"" moment. Requiring students to construct a molecule from the written formula is also instructive. I recommend obtaining extra carbon and hydrogen atoms for complex hydrocarbons and carbohydrates."
4,A sweet and human story...,"I have not read the book that this movie was based upon, but from the perspective of watching the movie by itself, I have to say that it was enjoyable! The location they chose for the filming was a perfect stage to tell this gentle story on, and the acting was pleasing. The characters are fleshed out fairly well, and the long time-span that they use to demonstrate the evolution of the main character's vocational life is a nice element.It's difficult to speak in greater detail without giving too much away, but I can say that this movie is worth a rental for anyone who enjoys stories that focus on interaction, reflection and the dynamics of working and platonic relationships. The characters were authentic and flexible. A good nun movie!"
2,If You Loved the Book...,"If you love the book as much as I do, you'll probably see the video/movie as a pale imitation. Granted, the media differ--no film could ever include all the episodes in the book. But, we never learn why Phillipa decided to enter the monestary, there's no Abbess Hester, no Keith, no Sister Polycarp, no Duranski, no motive for the entry of the Japanese postulants and so forth.The theme of the film is that Phillipa must learn to love everyone equally. Mercifully, the screen writer did leave us Dame Agnes, if only so Phillipa could have a difficult person to learn to love. The theme is therefore ""monastic."" Therefore this film is a cut above far too many movies about nuns."
1,Nothing like the Novel,"Having just read the novel, which was spectacular, I bought the DVD. Not only was the story unlike the book, but the acting was stilted, yes, even from the great Diana Rigg! All very disappointing."
4,As Good As NEU!,"As a big NEU! fan, I picked this up hoping that Michael Rother could deliver the goods with another band, and I was pleasantly surprised with what I got.The opening track, 'Deluxe (Immer Wieder)', actually sounds an awful lot like Kraftwerk's classic, 'Autobahn' - complete with the sing-song chanting and a bobbing synth beat. 'Monza (Rauf und Runter)' is a sort-of-reprise of the first track that winds up sounding almost exactly like 'After Eight' from the 'NEU! 75' album. The rest of the tracks are just good ambient synth-pop that at times reminds me of Mouse On Mars and even Herbie Hancock.Overall, it's a very groovy album. If you like 'NEU! 75', I can't imagine why you wouldn't like this one, too. NEU! fans should also check out Klaus Dinger's spinoff band, La Dusseldorf."
4,Excellent switch,"As an owner of an older entertainment system, I had a very limited amount of TOSlink connections (2). My choices were either buy a new receiver for several hundred dollars, or buy a TOSlink switch to manually switch over my sources. While the former would be more convenient, I feel the savings of several hundred dollars makes up for having to set a switch manually.This product works excellent, my only gripe with it is the placement of the inputs; I wish they were all in the back so the switch could be neatly setup. Other than that I have no complaints!"
4,120 cm ball,Great for exercise. Don't buy it if you don't have the room for it. It will definitely take u a lot of space
2,Thought I bought the blue 33.5 inch ball,Well I thought I bought the 33.5 inch ball but the one received was only around 12 inches in diameter.
4,Great Exercise Ball,"At first it had a little bit of a residue and plastic smell. It is a great ball, though. I use it as a chair for shorter tasks."
4,Cute.,"Not the best quality, a few pieces seemed to be slighly out dated. Overall though, it was a good buy. Most of the pieces were fresh and it brought back some memories and that to me is what really made this a great value. The two ladies that recieved this thought it was great, and told me stories about the fourties that made me laugh, so I would suggest this if you are looking to give it as a gift to someone in say their seventies or eighties like I did."
5,The best jazz there is.,"Herb Ellis' talent is just immeasurable. His playing the guitar is incredible; one would say: ""smooth"". I definitively recommend this album to any jazz lover, and any person that seeks for the best guitar playing."
5,interesting...very interesting,"A very interesting book. Used it for research. My grandpa owns it, let me borrow it, and I read it. Very, very good and informative."
1,just bad movie,"There is no coherent plot, acting is ok, and the main use of this dvd is for the sleeping-impaired. I'm a huge fan of independant films, I dont need flashy special effects, but a good story (which this doesnt have). Looking at the special effects and acting, its a shame they wasted what they did on this poor screenplay. Anything else would have been better.Avoid, and find some other independant gem."
5,Usual Great Le Creuset Quality,"As with our other Le Creuset iron wear, the coated surface is a breeze to clean, cooks evenly and dependably and looks great on the table."
1,Big Disappointment,Readers looking for the opportunity to get an inside look at Harris' life will probably end up disappointed. As the creator of such saucy and intriguing tales one would imagine the same from his memoirs. Instead it is a prolonged tale of a really depressed and confused person. I guess this credits Harris' creativity as a writer and shows that his novels are not just retales of his life. I think that I kept reading this because I was waiting for it to get interesting...but it didn't. In any case kudos to Harris for putting it all (or most of it) out there in print.
2,Boring,"I found myself bored with this book. I had an extremely hard time finishing. I expected better. I know it is his life story and all, but I think it could have been told a little better."
1,lame,"I am a gay man, and it can't get more boring to hear another gay whine about how hard it is to be gay in this society.I've read many great autobiographies, by Piri Thomes, Nathan McCall, Esmeralda Santiago, Reinaldo Arenas to name a few.This book was the Lamest biography I've ever read.This whining drama queen made me wanna throw all his books away.BUT, I think this is good for straight people to read."
5,Broken Hearts,"This is the first book I have read from the late Mr. Harris, and it is truly wonderful. The fact that he died last year only adds to the poignancy of the memoir. His life was filled with both much tragedy and much joy, and it is sad to think that his life was cut short at such a relatively young age. I recommend this book highly; I couldn't stop reading it."
2,Harris should stick to the creative side of writing,"I am an avid E. Lynn Harris fan but I was not impressed by this biography. He leaves out too much detail. The only thing I really got out of it was that his step father Ben was a main source behind his homosexuality. Calling him all kinds of names such as sissy, I think that scarred him for life. That type of verbal abuse usually does. Although I don't encourage homosexuality, Harris' books do make me think and now I'm more understanding to people who are homosexual or bisexual. I've read all of Harris' books and this is the worse one. I think he should have put a little more personal info into it. Just because you're a great writer doesn't always mean you can do a biography. Some people are just better at creating things than they are with telling a true story."
2,Just OK,"This was the first E. Lynn Harris novel I read, and if it weren't for my co-workers recommending his other books, I wouldn't read another novel he wrote. Too whiny and too many pity parties. I felt like yelling at him ""Get a grip man, you're not the only one with problems"". Not worth buying."
3,Humble beginnings,"E. Lynn Harris gives the reader a thorough background understanding of where he was born, to whom, and his struggles to overcome feelings of inferiority & insecurity. What's missing is how he became a writer and what drove him to write. Most of his adult career was as an IBM and computer sales rep, which was a surprise, but it's not until near the end that he discusses writing and publishing.The first half of the book is very engrossing, as he talks about his two fathers and his mother. But the second half does not divulge much about the man. He discusses going to college, dating, and successes as a school office holder. His homosexuality is widely known. He recounts chance encounters, pickups, lovers, heartbreaks, it's almost like reading a romance novel. Surprisingly, he glazes over the AIDS epidemic and how it effected he and his friends. Only 1 page is devoted to AIDS. The second part could have been more poetic and in-depth."
5,What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"I have been a fan of E. Lynn Harris ever since I read an excerpt of Just As I Am in Essence magazine. I had stopped reading to follow one of my other hobbies and didn't even know that a new book had been released until a friend told me about it. I raced to the bookstore and purchased my copy.I just finished reading this magnificent book. Applause, applause, and more applause.His memoir was written with the same grace and style as his others novels. I was drawn in from the very first chapter and remained riveted until the very last words. I found myself tearing up at moments and laughing aloud at others.This is a MUST READ!!!!!! I never doubted that I would enjoy this book, but I never realized that reading it would be therapuetic. I can't wait for the next novel."
4,Easy to set up and it stands up straight & sturdy.,I bought this because it was the perfect size for my deck. I was pleasantly surprised that the frame was an nice all-in-one expanding piece of engineering that worked exactly as the directions said it would. Very easy to put up by 2 people and the fabric seems very durable.
2,Not for current sufferers,"While in a treatment program for anorexia, I read this book hoping that it would be an inspirational tale of Sargent's recovery from this possessing disease. While the book was a definite page-turner full of feelings and situations I could completely relate to, it unfortunately lacked adequate explanation of her path to recovery.All in all, I think this is a great book for family members or friends who want to understand the mind of an anorexic however, I would not reccommend it to sufferers looking for answers or guidance."
4,Worthwhile for Como fans,"These recordings are National Guard radio programs. The condition of the radio programs is very good, though not pristine. Several of the songs are very similar to Victor recordings Perry did (It's A Good Day, It Happened In Monterey, For Me And My Gal). Several are numbers Perry never recorded (The Night Is Young, He, Stardust, Lover Come Back To Me -- probably not the song you think it is). Others are very different arrangements of songs Perry recorded (Hoop Dee Doo, I Found A Million Dollar Baby, I Believe). Two songs that were huge hits for Perry -- Hot Diggity and Juke Box Baby -- well, I can't decide if he did them live here (I think so) or if he lip-synced...they're so close. The songs Perry had never recorded are not quite so well done, but overall, Perry's voice is in good form here. And every once in a while, Perry belts one out, reminding us that he was not always soft-spoken when he sang. Definitely recommended for Como fans."
3,too old,"yeah, they give me this which is 10 months before expirationthat means the product is very old. (usually 3 years of expiration)"
4,Good product,We used these for my welcome bags for our wedding . Worked out well. I only gave 4 stars bc the packages were realllly really hard to open!
1,It's teh Stoopid!,"I listened to the first chapter on audio and could feel those precious IQ points dribbling out my ears. The writing is so pretentious and the editing so not there, I found myself wishing ALL of these characters could die very slow and painful deaths, being force-fed chicken nuggets at the subterranean food court at Union Station."
3,Another good work by Ms. Truman,"The story line at the outset makes a reader want to delve into the story quickly to get the scene set of the murder. Of course one murder is followed by others as the reader learns the initial murder may be linked to organized crime and a person in the witness protection program. The role of the police to solve the crime is center point for the rest of the book and Union Station and its many employees becomes the key piece in solving the matter as the reader finds out. All in all the book is a good read and will appeal to any murder mystery fan. The action is not as strong as in some works and the story is somewhat predictable. The characters fit the story, but again there is not much action."
5,Truman brings CIA & FBI characters to DC Union Station,Truman and her friends Mac and Annabel Smith continue to evoke suspense and bring you right into our nation's capitol.
5,I REALLY LIKED THIS ONE,This is the second book that I have read my Ms. Truman and I enjoyed it a bunch. It's about a writer and a hit man returning from Israel who is gunned down who was helping to promote the book. I love the characters and the story. It really kept me intrigued. I can't wait to read more from her. She is a great mystery writer and I hope that she continues to write more great books.
3,A Story of Political Intrigue,"Once in awhile I pick up a book from a novelist that I haven't read before, and read it. I have found some real gems this way, but I wouldn't say that this book did that for me. The book jacket summary, I felt did not fully explain what the book was about either. I expected something quite different from a pure political thriller before I began. I'm not sure if all Ms. Truman's books are politically motivated, but I won't be reading them to find out. In this book we have an author who is writing a book about an old mobster hit man, and the shock waves from the information the author has researched will rocket right up to the White House. The book is about keeping the reader's eye on the tapes that have the old mobster's words on them, rather than on individuals in the story. One exception is the big, boozy MPD detective - Bret Mullin. I really enjoyed his character, but in the end his contribution to the main plot was quite minimal."
2,Disappointing,"Both of us have been fans of her novels since the beginning. We found this offering to be overly wordy, slow and frankly boring. We fear she has fallen into the same trap as John LeCarre'"
3,Not the best of the Capital Crimes series,"This book wasn't bad, but there were too many characters to keep track of. And the basis of the story (i.e., the content of the upcoming book) took too long being revealed. I'm used to Mac and Annabel Smith being more involved in these stories, and while they don't have to be the main characters in every book, if they're going to be in it, they should be IN IT. In any case, this book seemed to meander around a little too much for me, and didn't hold my attention as closely as I would have liked."
3,Obvious Humor,"I dunno, the other reviewers thought this was a hoot, but I thought the humor was pretty obvious for the most part. Yes, I occasionally laughed aloud, and the very last chapter was particularly good. Occasionally Cameron comes up with a particularly apt turn-of-phrase that evokes a chuckle, or an extraordinarily inappropriate one that brings smiles. But you know, we've heard most of this before. How funny is it that teenage girls are on the phone all the time and that your phone bills are going to be twice the GNP of an impoverished African country? ...Buy it if you need a book for the bathroom desparately, otherwise, pass...Cameron is no Dave Barry."
5,Cameron is a Master!,"Wow. This is an amazing little book! Cameron has the ability to create such scenes of pathos that the reader doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. The scenarios in the shopping mall, for example, are so true-to-life (I'm just an aging observer) that one believes you could add a musical score and have a new millineum West Side Story! If there's a teenager in your house, you'll find every chapter an uproarious dose of realism. And, lest one has forgotten the pains and joys of those adolescent years, read this collection and remember with longing and relief!"
5,Not Just For Dad's,"I bought this book for my husband who could use some lightening up when it comes to our teenage daughters. Glancing through it I found myself laughing my head off. I kept setting it down and picking it up, until I finally gave in and read the entire book. Incredibly a funny true to life! I learned more from this book than I do from many parenting materials. If not for Bruce Cameron I would still be wondering why my daughter connects with her dad like a weed whacker connects with a steal pole. To raise a teen you have to have a sense of humor and here is one dad who is an expert in both humor and being an observant father. Very Funny and fun to read for EVERYONE with a daughter over 10 years of age. An absolute must for EVERY Dad!!!"
5,In case you lost your daughters' Reference Manual,"The first two sentences tell it all...""Not that it makes a whole lot of difference now, but I never intended to be the father of two teenage daughters. I suppose if I had been asked, I might hvae chosen to go with something cheaper, like a stable of race horses, or something easier to raise, like wolverines.""The epistle continues for another 315 pages. Buy one for yourself and another for your friend. They can thank you later."
4,Great Solo Piano,"I was never a fan of Yes, but I discovered this album back when it first came out because I worked in a record store. Fantastic solo piano."
1,Very big disappointment,"The author takes a reasonably understandable subject and makes it unbelievably complex, vague and abstract. This book is poorly organized and rife with errors. I was not able to complete the first few chapter of this book. You should read the reviews carefully before possibly wasting you time on this one, but if you want to talk philosophy and examine odd insights, buy this book."
2,Many subject are not illustrated in a coherent way,"The book covers a lot of subjects, but it makes even the simplest thing complex. In the end, you don't get much by reading the book."
5,This book is outstanding.,"It reads very clearly considering the compexity of the topic, goes into detail while remaining concise and puts each topic in proper perspective, keeping the reader grounded as to not only how to use cetain technologies but also when and why to use them. I've read 5 other books on various aspects of .Net and countless articles and this is by far the best work I've come across. -Cheers to Don Box :)"
2,"Not too helpful...,","If I hadn't already had some .NET knowledge, this book would have been extremely frustrating. I found the topics poorly, and in many cases, inadequately explained. I often had to refer to other books to get the full picture. I would not recommend this book. There are better ones out there."
5,Great Book for Experts,"This is not an introductory text, but if you want to know everything about the internals of the CLR, this is the book to read. It contains information on classes that are not even documented at msdn. Specifically, the information on the messaging infrastructure is stuff you won't find anywhere else. And the explanations are clear and easy to follow. A truly wonderful book."
4,Poweful Begining of Dub,"Peter Broggs with his merge of traditional roots to Dub shines bright in Cease The War. Songs of struggle and songs of praise with pure dub vibes. ""Jah Jah Voice is calling"" and ""International Farmer"" are Dub epics."
5,1 GB Problem Solver !!!,"My 256 MB card ""died""--As I scanned the net to find the right buy, I knew Amazon would probally have the answer. The SanDisk 1 GB Ultra II is very quick in all areas compared to the 256, don't remember the brand, don't want to. The 1 GB allows 880 shots which will be appreciated. The price was very fair and Amazon's shipping is always very quick !!"
4,Quality product,"I brought this product for my Olympus E-500 Digital camera .It worked fine with camera .If sandisk can come with better firmware update I believe it can performe wonderful with camera .The tranfer speed of data is ok and Sandisk can think about improvement by updated firmware .Overall my experience with Product is satisfied.So far there is crash . Price difference between 2Gb and 1GB is too high ,otherwise I will go for 2GB in the sameproduct line.It come in sealed retail package.I upgraded my camera firmware to latest in order to use this product trouble free."
4,"bought in 2006 for $40, now it's $90?!?!?","Great card (I have a Canon Powershot A80). Yes, just like any other card, you lose a little space when it gets formatted, BUT THE DARN THING COSTS AS MUCH (or little) AS MY 256 MB CARD THAT I GOT AT BEST B**. ouch. The only gripe is that the packaging can withstand a 12 story drop or a half-ton nuclear burst (whichever comes first) - so the card sneers at you standing there with scissors in your hand."
5,Great card at a great price!,"I just picked up my second Sandisk 1GB Ultra II card, and I am just as impressed since I bought my first one. I have the Canon 20D and with this card I never have to wait for pictures to be written to the card, even if I do a picture burst.I would recommend this card to anyone who needs large storage and fast speeds. Never had a problem with this card, giving it a 5."
1,"Bought it and returned it, disappointed.","I bought this card for my Powershot A610. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all- the camera, which still works fine with the very small card that came with it, reported a memory card error as soon as this card was inserted. The camera also refused to perform a low-level format, returning the same error message instead. An isolated defect? Well, I Googled 'memory card error' and got to read about a LOT of Powershot owners who are having the same problems with SD memory cards not manufactured by Canon. Which is a shame, because at first glance it looks like the Canon cards don't get any bigger than 512 Mb. So- be advised that if you're buying this to use with a Powershot, it might be a good idea to look into it a little further."
2,Try opening it in a jam,Sandisk truly needs to learn how to create packaging people can open. This company has not discovered how to be centered on the customer yet.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory. Loaded fine, but only lasted 3 months. Card lost all it's memory and was unable to take a new load. Very disappointed in the life of the card."
4,Good but also look at Sandisk Extreme III,"This is undoubtely one of the best cards out there in compact flash category. However for about the same price you can buy Extreme III CF from SanDisk which has 20mb/s write speed.However, before you buy this or any other high speed CF card take into account what it will be used for. Unless you are a professional photographer shooting 3-4 shots/sec with image size as large as 3meg, you will be fine with lesser speed cards. It is important not to get carried away with all the X (40x vs 80x etc..) and Y from different manufacturers. In most cases if you are shooting with a dSLR (D70 is what I use) your camera may have enough buffer memory to compensate a slower card. Which translates into more money saved for other stuff.I personally like the SanDisk brand because they are one of the first one in the market with CF and most reliable and I own a 1Gig SanDisk Extreme III card that I am very happy with."
4,As good as expected,"I had no doubts or reservations about ordering this memory card, and it has lived up to all expectations. It is fast enough for general rapidsnap continuous shoot and is the perfect size. Even at raw with my Nikon D70 I can get over 150 pictures on the card, which is more than enough for me since I usually have my computer with me and can download them if it fills up and I need space.With memory cards, bigger capacity is always better. But if you can't afford anything bigger, this one is a perfect size. Anything smaller is ridiculous in my experience."
5,Completely Satisfied,Great product - works as stated. No problems - would buy it again and feel comfortable recommending it.
5,SanDisk SDCFH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II CompactFlash Card,This is the second SanDisk card I have owned. My first card has perormed without error for over 4 years. I am using the new 1 GB card with a Canon 20D digital camera and so far it has performed without error.
5,SanDisk Ultra II One Gigabyte CF Card,"What an AWESOME card.You can beat it.. fast, furious, and roomy.I use it in a Canon PowerShot S30 - 611 pictures @ full resolution, and best quality.If you wanna use it for transferable storage, its nice - holds the equivalent of one and a half CD-ROMs.You won't be disappointed with this card!"
1,Is there a GordonZone?,"I have not received my order!Is there such a company GordonZONE?I emailed 2 times but no reply!It has been over 6 weeks!The flashcard could have been sent in a regular envelope.This must be a bogus company,to rip us off.Why is Amazon part of this ripoff?JP"
2,There are better choices available,"I agree with what others have said about this book being disorganized & not up to Falcon's standards. Additionally, the book is poorly written and reads as if it were written by a high schooler. Nolan's comment below nicely sums up the book. Too bad, because I usually enjoy the Falcon hiking books.By contrast, Lisa Foster's book, ""Rocky Mountain National Park: The Complete Hiking Guide,"" ISBN # 1565795504, is great. Foster's book was the one I actually used."
2,Not What I Expected from a Falcon Guide,"During past trips to the Smoky Mountains, Glacier, and Yellowstone I found the corresponding Falcon Guides invaluable for planning appropriate hikes for my family and expected the same from this guide. I was wrong, and disappointed. This guidebook reads more like, well, a guidebook than a hiking guide. It's written more as a narrative without the useful information I've come to expect from Falcon-specifically, hikes arranged in the book by area of the park, length, difficulty, elevations gains/losses, and maps. I suppose some of this information is within the text, but the layout makes it much more tedious to find. Not completely useless as a planning tool but not recommended as a quick reference guide."
3,I am lost,This book lacks information about the elevation change over the hikes and has maps that are hard to figure out compared to other hiking books I have used in other parks and hiking areas.
4,Rocky Tops,"The couple has written a very good guide to trails in the park. Not the best book in my library on the topic, but in the top 2 or 3Hiking Rocky Mountain National Park, 9th"
1,Not An Overview Of The Park,"The first 25 pages are a general, somewhat condescending, complaint about how many people go to the park and how they should act while there. The rest of the book is detailed twists and turns of trails."
3,"Good book, but would like another option","For anyone hiking in RMNP, this is a good book to have along, but I'd prefer to have a second option, like Malitz's RMNP Dayhiker's Guide. Malitz's book has altiude gain, elevation at destination, distance one way, and which trailhead to use at the beginning of the description of each trail. This book just has a chart in the back. It also is just a little more like a story book than a guide book. Not what I need in the middle of the wilderness. The only pictures are sketches, where Malitz's Dayhiker's Guide has lots of nice color photos, which can take a little of the surprise out of what you're about to see, but do help in location recognition. Dannen's guide is full of info, you just have to read a little more to find it. Both are good companions to have along and to use for preparation, but if I could only carry one I'm afraid this one would stay behind in favor of Malitz's Dayhiker's Guide or the soon-to-be-released Frommer's RMNP 3rd Edition."
1,Yawn yawn,"I have to weigh in with the reviewer who gave this hiking guide only one star. I totally agree with his/her evaluation and description of the Dannens' book. I always buy trail books and read them at home before going off on a hiking trip. I purchased this book but it was so boring I almost fell asleep reading it. Needless to way, I won't bother to take it with me to Colorado this June."
2,"Lots of interesting ideas and concepts, but hard to read",The ideas described in this book should be described in a much shorter and more coherent form. Neither computer graphics people nor physicists nor engineers are used to reading books of this type and therefore I fear that most book bought will never really be read.
3,Let's agree to disagree,"Forget the topic of this novel: ""What's pornography?""This whole novel is based on a saying attributed to Voltaire: ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" (May be, the hero of this novel, even approves of what he defends in the court.)Wallace is a good story teller. However, this book is no masterpiece by any means. I agree with the fundamental premise of the book though: ""Apply censorship sparingly or not at all."""
4,Initial comments,Toilet just installed. There are many versions of the Drake toilet so make sure you order the correct one. We bought the ADA height and elongated bowl at 1.6 gal flush. I thought it was 1.28 gal. Toilet flushes flawlessly. Easy to install. Base unit was manufactured in Vietnam which was a surprise and dissappointment. I don't think that was stated online. I thought Toto had moved manufacture to the USA.
5,GREAT TOILET!,This is my second purchase of this brand and model of TOTO toilets and think that they are great. Good flush with no problems at all and the self cleaning is nice. Would recommend to others
5,Toto Drake ADA Toilet,"I have owned this toilet for about 3 years (bought somewhere else for more $) and it just plain WORKS. It has never failed to flush the first time, even though it uses a tiny amount of water. It is no louder than a regular toilet. We bought the ADA version because we want to stay in our home as long as possible even when we get infirm (many years yet, I hope, and I expect this toilet will still be working.) It doesn't feel as high as many ADA toilets in public places; it really feels just right. The only downside (minor) is that it doesn't wash the sides vigorously, so they may very occasionally require cleaning after use. Highly Recommended."
2,Strange World Of Quantum Mechanics,Not as good as recommended by a fellow Professor in his DVDon Quantum Mechanics.
3,"Now, Wait Just a Minute...","Okay, I've about had it. I'm 45 years old, the perfect age for people able to bridge the gap between the 50s to 2000. The first record I bought was ""Hound Dog"" by Elvis. The most recent was the debut by Tsar (great power pop/punk record, by the way...). Can no one put together a Hermits record with ""Where were You When I Needed You"" or ""Hold On""? I mean, the latter song was only the title of their feature film at the height of their popularity. I don't sit around day and night waiting for Herman's Hermits records to appear, I've opened for bands from the Cramps to R.E.M. But, for the love of Pete, WAKE UP!! In the Immortal words of Faber College, ""Knowledge is Good""."
1,"These authors use the ""Farce""","I spotted Gavin and Yvonne Frost's Church and School of Wicca online and thought I'd better get one of their books to read before investing the ""tuition."" I have never been happier to have bought a book only to learn it was a jumble of ridiculous notions.As a practicing pagan of over 15 years, I was astounded at the lack of ethics presented by this book. Their use of ""The Force"" from Star Wars to describe the magic around us may be considered helpful by beginners but it is for those very beginners that I most fear. If this book were your first exposure to ""Wicca"", I use quotes because I don't feel this book exemplifies Wicca at all, you are likely to be a danger to both yourself and others.Please, consider Scott Cunningham or even Silver Ravenwolf as alternatives before buying anything written by the Frosts."
2,It could be a lot better,"This is not a good book for any beginner. I did not find it easy to follow. It had a lot of stories about mistakes that others had made, which is the only good thing I can say about this book. It shows that the best of us will mess up from time to time. I did not like how they kept referring back to their school over and over. If you are like me and started most of your reading with Scott Cummingham, I would say to stick with some of the books he recommends before reading this one. If you do read this book, read it with a very open mind, and don't take everything to heart."
4,Not your average,"One of the most down-to-earth, practical book on Wicca I've found. It's eclectic and free of the pomp that comes with most books on the topic.I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind, as much of the information could be helpful to anyone: info on how to set goals (you'd be amazed at how many people can't do it), and how to live more stress-free and happy - then it shows you how to suppliment those actions with mind and spellwork.You will find no fluffy-bunny stuff in here, no arcane languages, no strange concoctions, and no Christian bashing for the most part ('cause that really bugs me). You WILL find a few homeopathic remedies, light physics of spellwork and energy-raising, some good living advice, a few entertaining anecdotes and a great deal of open-mindedness. Highly recommended for more advanced students."
3,Loved the fanny pack BUT....,"The strap broke after 2 weeks of wearing it. Which is weird because it LOOKS really solid. Not only that, the strap doesn't stay where you set it... keeps getting loose. Now, for the 2 weeks I had it before it broke, I really, really liked it (except for constantly having to take it off to make it tight again). It's a nice size and I could store everything I wanted, and get at it easily. But for the $40 or so I paid for this thing, it should have held up a LOT better than that. I bought it to replace a leather fanny pack I had for literally decades."
2,Low quality,"Wavy stitching, a small holl in the main lightning, details which should be parallel are not."
3,"Good, but not exactly as on the picture","It's a pretty good Fanny Pack with a lot of pockets/sections that should certainly benefit people like me who'd like to have their stuff organized and easily located.On a cons side, the picture displayed on the web created impression that this is soft, smooth highest quality leather; in reality the leather is quite coarse, and not very soft.The size is perhaps a little bit too big for a fanny bag, so that you'll feel that it's there on your belt."
5,Leather Cell Phone/Fanny Pack,This fanny pack is the perfect size. I have owned one for two years and use it everyday. I have found it especially useful to carry all my personal items on motorcycle trips. I love it so much that I ordered a second one as a backup when and if this one every wears out.
4,fanny pack,"I liked the product but I bought it for my wife. She states that if the leather was softer, she could get more into purse. Is there a bigger fanny pack as I would order a bigger fanny pack for her and take the one I received for myself."
3,survey,it was a good product.However the seller said that the strap extended to 46 inches and it didnt.Therefore i had to send it back. they should have been more accurate
3,"It's functional, but not long-lasting","The piping around the zipper openings wears out fairly quickly, showing a white core.I use the ""cell-phone"" pocket for a Swiss Army knife, which is a good use for it."
1,Poor quality product from Amerileather,"Worst quality fanny pack I have owned. Made in China of low quality vinyl, NOT LEATHER. I didn't use it within the 30 day return period, or I would have returned it. After about a month the top layer of vinyl began flaking off. I'm getting tired of friends asking me why my fanny pack has the white dots all over it, so I'm looking for a replacement. This was a big disappointment."
3,Fanny Pack - Black,"I like the Fanny Pack, especially that it is made of good quality leather. I could use a little bigger one. The main complaint I have is that it is much too big around for me, and I am not a really small person. I cannot make it any smaller. I believe I read a review with this same complaint before I bought the Fanny Pack."
2,leather fanny packi,"This fanny pack is much smaller than I thought it wouldbe according to the online description. I'll have to payshipping and a restock fee if I return it, so I'll keep itand hope I'll use it sometime in the future.So, I don't recommend this fanny pack if you need one withlots of room."
2,Reformat,"Junk, absolute junk. Don't even try to complain to Creative. Talk about a bunch of losers. If you have a soundblaster already installed, you might as well reformat to get the new one to work. I am a computer engineer for crying out loud. The soundblaster uninstall does not work, and you can spend forever trying to track down all the files that need to be deleted so that your new card will install correctly, but you will never find them all.EDIT: I decided to up my review to 2 stars because my sound card has been working flawlessly since the install. However, If you have XP, and are replacing an existing Creative sound card with an Audigy, be prepared to reformat. I am one of two guys who sets up everybodys computers at work, install new hardware, software, etc. Everytime somebody has brought me a computer with XP and a creative soundcard already installed and wanted me to install an Audigy, I have had to reformat to get it to work."
1,Hyper Threaded Processor Users Beware,The good about this card: It sounds great and has nice inputs.The bad about this card: It constantly crashes my Windows XP Pro box. After much searching I found that Creative has problems with Hyper Threaded or Multi-Processor systems. If you have one AVOID THIS CARD LIKE THE PLAGUE. Creative's idea?? Disable Hyper Threading. My idea?? Buy a different brand of sound card!
5,Sound Blaster Mega Fan!,"When I had built my first computer, I had a Motherboard that had built-in Sound & Video. I disabled both Sound and Video and put in my own Video Card; the Sound Card I chose was a Sound Blaster Live Platinum 5.1.I've up-graded Motherboard,Video and now Sound to the Audigy 2 zs Platinum. It's Built from the same tech that my card has with sweet added features; Like 24 Bit vs. 16 Bit,instead of just 5.1 it will do 6.1 and 7.1 THX Speakers. It also has a Built-in dts ES decoding,Dolby Digital EX decoding, EAX Advanced HD. The price; I couldn't pass up! Brand New, everythink in the Box, shipped fast! Need I say more? how about SWEET!"
5,Awesome Audio Card,"I use my computer to sing KaraOK. I upgraded the audio card from a integrated one to this Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum. The sound quality has been greatly improved as I listen to the playback: I no longer hear noise and the voice became more dynamic.It is easy to install the card. Just disable the previous one, shut down the computer and install the hardware, start the computer, follow the instruction of the manual to install the software and then it worked great. P.S. my OS is Windows XP SP 2."
4,Products are of a good quality.,"Overall this is a good deal. However, be sure to mention what camera you have when purchasing. The lens adapter I purchased with this package did not fit my Dx7590. The company was VERY helpful to correct the problem but sent the same adapter. I had to get an adapter from a different company."
1,Who listens to this noise?,"WTF *is* this? It's not danceable, it's not inspiring, it's not inspired, it's not even interesting. It's not relaxing, so it wouldn't even make good elevator music. Maybe this could be used to gently torture terrorist suspects in captivity. They'd all confess within 2 hours I'm sure. Other than that, this would seem to be a total waste of vinyl, plastic, and production resources. Come to think of it, I'm wasting my time reviewing it. I used to be a Yes fan, but this has no resemblance... what was I thinking. Eeewwww!! Take it away! Please!"
4,"Competent, Clear, and Challenging, but Cumbersome","Harris' book has much to recommend it. He is a competent scholar who writes clearly, and the book fairly represents the scholarly consensus on most issues without loosing sight of the real-life concerns of most readers of the biblical texts. Each edition of the book has become more detialed, and the major problem with this current edition is precisely this: it is overly detailed for a freshman level college class. Earlier editions worked well at this level, but too many students struggled to complete assigned readings in this edition."
2,"Below average, with far too many political digressions","For the most part, this book is competent and easy to understand. However, Harris seems to enjoy picking on politically sensitive parts of the Bible and injecting political rather than religious interpretations. He strays from his own purpose and that completely undercuts any of his credibility has an ubiased scholar. For example, after his summary of the section of Romans that calls homosexuality unnatural and quite definitely a sin, he injects a paragraph about the theory that homosexuality is not a choice, but something that is genetic or formed in early childhood. That's nice, but it has absolutely nothing to do with interpreting the Bible has it's written there. He does something similar in the passage about Sodom and Gemorrah. Ah well."
1,Author wants to debunk the Bible,"We used this book in our ""Understanding the Bible"" course and I just could not believe what I was reading in this book.Harris is apparently determined to discredit everything in the Bible that he can. Throughout the book, he would explain some stuff then say, ""oh, by the way, 'recent scholarship' has shown that most of the stuff here is false/inaccurate/biased.""And I just got so tired of it. I hate the fact that the author does not once admit his bias. (He is obviously biased against believing anything in the Bible.) I agree with another reviewer that this sort of ""liberal"" book on the Bible can be dangerous to a new or uneducated believer. But it can be an interesting to those who wonder what an unbelieving mind can come up with.The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. (1 Corinthians 2:14)"
3,Review,I think the book came just the way I was told.. But I found the book cheaper somewhere else and sent it back.. But thank you anyways for the purchase.
5,Extremely useful,"First off, thanks to the seller as it came in time and well packaged. It was extremely useful for my Bible Studies class, couldn't rate it higher. Just a shame I had to give it away once school was over."
2,Decent Introduction,"The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says ""modern scholars say"", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority)."
3,Understanding the Bible,"I got the book, but turns out it was the seventh edition and I needed the eighth, but I can get by with the seventh."
5,Remarkable book!,"This is a remarkable book. Admittedly my vice is quail hunting, but this book is that and much, much more. It demonstrates an insight into the minds of people. Its language can be a bit rough but only in the way people speak. To anybody who has a love for the outdoors, nay, civilization, this is highly recommended. Its near literature."
3,california reader,"this book is good but a bit unclear. you'll need a teacher to help you through this though. otherwise, it's a pretty good book and i got most of the concepts."
4,useful,"I bought this to replace the filters in my air purifier. It seems to work well, though is not perfect. I expected it to filter more than it does."
5,Cheapest place to buy!,"Even though I am fully satisfied with my order, I sure wish the cost of these filters were not so over the top....and this is the only place to find them at this price."
3,"If bass is your first instrument, stay away","This book is supposed to be something of a comprehensive index of everything bass, but unfortunately it is one that lacks an answer key. I do not know how to read music (I've actually learned three times, but I just keep letting it fall out of use), and that being the case this book is absolutely worthless to me. I rated it this way because it is supposed to provide you with everything you need to play-- except how to read the book! Even an appendix of ""how to read"" music would solve this problem! Although it occasionally provides images of the fretboard akin to tabs (Why not just tabs? I have no idea) that concession fails to make up for its inaccessibility."
1,Author doesn't know subject. Poorly written project--Zero!!,"I was very disappointed when I received this book and I plan to send it back for a refund. Society has come so far with acceptance and dealing with many of the black and white issues. This author who makes an attempt to appear to be an expert on this subject has sorely missed the mark and overall appears to be racist. In 2002 there are so many programs of cultural diversity that provide insight and understanding that we do not need anyone else bringing back the KKK issues, slavery issues and things of this sort in a book. Thumbs down."
5,Fixed up my broken cat really good,"I inherited a really big and clumsy cat when I got married. Recently, he's fallen off stuff and hurt himself, my wife took him to the cat doctor and xrays showed lots of arthritis in his hips. I've been giving him this stuff for a few months, not even every day, and he's jumping and running like I would imagine that a new cat does. Funny thing is, the cat thinks its a treat and comes running whenever I shake the bottle. Great product."
5,The great pocket,"This book is so helpful. It's important to keep track of your diet and activities during the day. This book does just that. Easy to carry around because of it's size. Also, a few helpful tips."
5,Great little book .,A great little diary for someone trying to track there food intake. Easy to take along. Book was in excellent condition and packaged well to avoid damage from shipping.
4,Very Helpful,"I found the Food and Excercise Diary very helpful in keeping track of what I eat and the exercise that I do. Handy size for carrying with you when going out to eat, that way you don't leave anything out."
3,"Small, compact diary of food eaten and exercise",This small book is a great place to record the food and exercise that takes place on a daily basis. It is small enough to fit in a pocket or purse. The only problem is that the pages fall out of the binding. I wound recommend making it spiral and adding more weeks. What a great price.
2,I was dissappointed in the book!,"Good deal for the price. However, the book is very small and hard to write in. It would be better if it was in a spiral bound book. I found it extemely hard to write in. Great concept, but lacking in the design of the book."
4,Not quite Excellent,"I have been a fan of OLP for some time. I own all the cds so purchased the dvd as a special treat. It is wonderful. A very energetic band, powerful and compelling. My only complaint is that my personal favorite 3:00 A.M. which concluded the set was more of an audience sing-along. Not really performed by the band. Overall, a very, very nice dvd. I recommend it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This dvd was not up to par!!! He did not even personally sing 4am, the AUDIENCE sang every word. I know i didn't pay to watch an Audience sing their songs. I recommend you spend your money on their cd's instead, because at least those actually have good sound quality, unlike most of his vocals."
4,Good light moisturizer,This product is great in the summer if you have braids or a natural. I wouldnt use this product for straight styles.This product definitely keeps my hair moisturized and the best thing is its light.This is definitely a staple for me.
2,Disappointing for a Buck,Pinned connections and the wine opener bent on the first use. Buck has a warranty but this is not worth the trouble. I've consigned it to the toolbox in case I need a knife on a project.
3,Groom Lake,I guess I expected more from a William Shattner movie. It was OK but could have been much better.
1,shoot this movie to the stars,"Absolutely the worst sci-fi movie ever made. The filming is much to close up and more suited to x-rated movies. Script, acting and directing aren't much better and the special effects (or the lack of it) are very low-budget. Don't buy or even rent this. See ""Communion"", ""Roswell"", ""Fire in the Sky"" or ""Intruders"" for some serious UFO stuff."
3,my 15 minutes,i thought this was an o-kay book. it'smy mom' s era....30's-thru 50's. i had to look up people i was unfamilar with--she tells of star's when she met them and later how they end up in life.
2,Disappointed,I am a big fan of the Dave Chappelle show. This video was a disappointment for me as I feel Dave Chappelle is unbelievably funny.I was mainly disappointed because it seemed to me that the only subject he discussed was racism. The other disappointment I had was that the video was very short.
5,"If you don't own this, I don't know what you're waiting for ...","This is an excellent example of Dave Chappelle doing what he does, best ...Stand-up Comedy.His timing, his expressions, his subtlety--everything that makes his comedic timing genius."
5,really very nice and good.,"This is probably R leval material, but it was still funny. The best part was when he made fun of seseme street. He seemed like he didn't want to stop when he ran out of time and material. He didn't end it well, but it certinly didn't hurt the overall perrformance."
5,funniest comedy ever,"This is so funny. It mocks sesame street, pepe lepew, kennedy, bill clinton, and more. a must have"
2,overrated,"Nothing but stereotypical african american humor that we've heard a billion times before- how many more comedians can do the same bits on cops, that ""white-voice"" imitation, racism, and differences between whitesa and blacks- come on already, it's the same jokes over and over and over again- I like Chapelle but think he's given way too much credit"
5,The Best of Chappelle,This is the best stand-up I have ever seen. I saw this when it was on HBO years ago and it is funny every time I watch it.
5,Funniest Standup In A Decade,"No, doubt this is the funniest standup show that's come out in at least 10-15 years. I laughed so hard when this first came out that I missed half the jokes. Dave Chappelle is the funniest man alive right now. Don't miss the Chappelle Show on Comedy Central, it takes his humor and turns it into skits and sketches, and it's just as funny.THE CHICKEN!"
4,COMEDIC GENIUS!,"From where I am, I do not see Chapelle on HBO. But I saw this gentleman on Conan o'Brian's late night show, and was hooked. He was comfortably slumped in Conan's chair and displayed a natural sense of comic timing. A quick search on Amazon revealed that there were DVDs of his shows. I ordered. Was in store for a ribtickling hour or so. This guy is good!In this particular cameo, he comfortably treads the line of race, social commentary, kids, the presidency, relationships and some other miscellaneous things. I could go on about the material in and of itself, but that'd only serve to spoil something that you should have no idea is coming at you.Highly recommended for anyone who likes humor."
2,No room for guests,"This set is beautiful, with great details. The only negative is that the table is so small, there's no room for additional family/guests. I was excited to find the older dining room set (with birthday and pizza party items) to supplement this newer set."
3,NICE ADDITION TO THE DOLLHOUSE,"THIS IS A CUTE WELL MADE TOY, BUT MY GIRLS AREN'T AS IMPRESSED WITH IT AS THEY ARE THE OTHER SETS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SINCE IT IS VERY CUTE AND DIVERSE!"
4,Goes well with the set,"Anything more to this set and it would not have fit in the ""Fisher Price Loving Family Dollhouse""Nicely done, my DD likes this set quite a bit and oohed and ahhed when she unwrapped it. She likes the clock and the tea set. Sure, 2 chairs is a little skimpy but I think having 4 would have frustrated her to no end trying to set it up by herself.Well built and withstands the attentions of her 3 year old brother. :) I'm also happy with the lack of sound/light effects here, not everything needs to be an overkill."
3,Lifelike,This is a cute set and looks lifelike. The furniture is too big for the room in the dollhouse. Not just the dining room but all of it. I think it is hard for tiny hands to maneuver in the rooms with the dolls and furniture. The set itself is made well....the child learns because it looks like a real set.The set is durable and takes a lot of abuse from my two year old.
4,"Good product, solves a common problem.","This bit works very well for me but I have one gripe, It's slightly out of balance and it rumbles my table. It's also so big I wouldn't even try to use it hand-held. It could easily rip the router out of your hands. But it also enabled me to do a 3/4"" rabbet in a single pass on MDF. I make speaker enclosures and this bit makes the difference between a single pass with the router and multiple setup/passes."
3,Ok for certain information,Nice pictures and good examples of tartenware. No estimated values are provided. I would not pay full price for this book; buy it used. Fairly good example of how tartenware came into fashion.
5,Happy Baby ABC,"My son almost two years old enjoyed the images and words in the book. It was exciting for the both of us to watch his acknowledge of things that he had known prior, and be able to acknpwledge new things that he viewed in the book. I since have purchased a variety of Happy baby books since we are expecting."
5,board book,I bought this book after my son loving Happy Baby Colors. The bright pictures and and big letters have gotten him to learn all his letters by age 3!
2,Interesting Prototype But Not Ready For the Showroom,"If you like collecting novelties or interesting historical artifacts, this may prove to be one. There are at least new ideas coming forth in the area of harmonica physics and one might become an amazing product. I waited a month before I wrote this because I wanted to be fair to the incredible effort that went into designing this and making it affordable. Sorry, but it is hard to NOT bend notes and thus the sound ""pallete"" becomes very un-chromatic. It's good for honking but too much honking without contrast is dull. Contrary to what you might believe, Little Walter did more than just honk. He contrasted dirty and pretty sounds with his ""Mississippi Saxophone"" like a jazz master. My advice: use the money to buy a chromatic harmonica, or, buy Howard Levy's video ""New Directions for Harmonica"" and get some basics on playing a ten-hole diatonic chromatically by using that ""simple"" instrument expressively and imaginatively."
2,I love ball but this didn't work for me.,"If you've watched the NBA you've seen better hightlights. I really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work for me. It really wasn't worth getting, very disappointing. It just had endless highschool videos of dunks, no insight into the players or their lives or their real skills. Lots of player I didn't recognize or care about their highschool carers. Kind of boring, something like the Allen Iverson video is more interesting."
5,Flawless process,"I ordered the parts, the parts came quickly, perfect fit - flawless vendor, flawless parts, flawless Amazon process."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased 2 Germ Guardian H2000 units in 2008 and was initially quite pleased with their performance. After 1 month, the LED lights failed on 1 unit. The unit was replaced eventually after several failed calls to customer service. The replaced unit's lights eventually failed as did the second units LED's (?design flaw). Eventually the second unit failed completely after 16 months, and I have been unsuccessful in reaching customer service for 3 weeks, after multiple calls and leaving several messages."
1,HORRIBLE !,"I purchased this product before I had read any reviews on it. The first one died and now I am on my second one. Luckily, I had saved the receipt. It's guaranteed for 3 years, and I will get my money's worth out of it, if I have to go through 100 of them!"
1,don't buy it....,"After using it for about 4-5 months, the inside of the water tank started molding. First thing, their customer service stinks. It usually goes into a prompt telling you to leave a message, so I did and waited for 2 weeks and no one called. I kept calling and I finally got through. I wanted them to replace just the plastic water tank but they insisted that it is very usual for it to mold and suggested that I clean it out using water and vinegar. Disappointed that they won't stand by their product, I had no choice to try it but with no luck. I must have cleaned and rinsed it more 1o times and it simply will not come off.I'm not taking any chances using a humidifier with mold inside the water tank, so I'm throwing it away and never buying any products from them again.I give this ZERO stars but it seems that that was not an option so I had to choose at least one star."
4,"Great Sound Card, Poor Music File Format","This sound card puts out great sound, much better than Windows Media Player or any other Player I've tried. It has many Audio adjustments so you can have your own sound studio.The Black Box that comes with it seems like overkill and I think most people do not even need it. This obviously adds to the cost.This could probably be rated 5 stars except for the Music File Format. I't's poor compared to the Windows Media Player"
3,Hmmm...,It is not up to the expectation of that I have thought about this hardware but i will watch over this slowly.
5,Used Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum EX Kit,"For being a used item of a once very expensive sound card & external break-out box (digital & analog), this kit is the perfect balance and control for admiration of what sound should and could be for computers. Inputs, outputs and a remote control at your fingertips! Takes a bit of work to set it up and a little bit more work to tweak the settings and programs, but once completed, it makes you feel like you're running a high end stereo system within your PC system. -- And it can be used to output on your 5.1 theatre home system as well. Two Thumbs up for Creative Labs in making the perfect package, which audio enthusiasts will thoroughly enjoy."
2,interference problems,This card looks very fine on paper en sounds also pretty good.The only problem is that the card is nor working properly in my system.I have four western digital 740 sata disks in my systemthis sound card picks up noise when i reading or writing to the disks this is very disturbing. I replaced the card with anothersimpler card and everything works oke.
3,fun little book,It does give some good fashion.For people who love vintage fashion will like this book and it will be very helpful.
2,disappointment,"Would not recommend these if you have a normal foot because the shoe does not grip around the middle enough so that the foot ends up sliding forward and hitting the big toe; not good. Also, the softness gives it a fuddy duddy ""old lady"" look and feel. The cushiness on the sole/instep doesn't do a thing for comfort since the toe hits the front of the shoe. These might be really nice for those with wide feet. The dark blue ones are not a true navy, they are lighter and ""bluer""."
4,great camera for the price,"I've been using for several weeks now, easy to use, great pictures, lots of features."
3,pretty decent sequel,"while i didn't think this movie was quite as good as the first it wasstill pretty good.Christopher Walken returns and once again steals theshow.his character has some great lines,and provides some laughs aswell.Brittany Murphy is good here as well.Jennifer Beals wasadequate,although i didn't find her performance outstanding.the movieitself was pretty decent,although it loses momentum a few times and ifelt it lagged a bit in spots.and i thought the ending was actuallyvery good,though.not something you would normally expect from this typeof movie.or at least i wouldn't think so.overall,despite some weakpoints,-having Christopher Walken,some humorous touches,and good endingelevate this sequel.for me,The Prophecy II is a 3.5/5"
3,The Making of one of the Nefalim,"Angels can't drive and can't work computers--clearly not made for our world. Memorable line (from an angel-created zombie): ""you're keeping me alive because you can't do DOS?!"" It's all pretty funny from the right perspective, and Christopher Walken makes it work, but it's not as good as the 1st and 3rd in the series of 3. Question: how did Michael manage to hide those wings in bed? ;->"
4,viwer,"The PROPHECY II is fantastic!!!!! Mabey not as good as the first one,but still great! forget part 3 1 and 2 are the one's to watch!"
3,Not as good as first but still entertainind.,This film is much more biblical than the first. We needed to see more Danzig. DANZIG RULES. I have a cat.
2,"Not as good as the first one, but...","I loved the first film in the series. I did not care for this film. It didn't have enough fresh ideas, and some of the new ideas were just stupid. The main problem was with the cast's talent, or lack thereof. The first one in the series had a great cast all-around. But, in most returning roles, new faces replaced the original actors. I guess the originals from the first film weren't interested in being in a strait-to-video release.The Prophecy 2 has one big thing going for it, and that is the scenes between Christopher Walken and Brittany Murphy. Walken is his naturally creepy self in these scenes. Brittany Murphy, as the Goth Girl ""Izzie"", shows that she can hold her own in scenes with big-time actors (as she did three years later in ""Don't Say a Word"").I think the film is well-worth viewing just to see those two opposite each other. But still, only for fans of the first film, or if you're a Christopher Walken or Brittany Murphy fan."
1,what the hell happened?!,"Jennifer Beals stars as Valerie Rosales, a young woman who encounters a man named Danyael, played by Russell Wong, after he falls from the sky and hits her car. Danyael and Valerie get their freak on and she suddenly gets pregnant. This brings back Chris Walken, Gabriel from hell and he tries to stop this baby from being born. The boy is the Nephilim, half angel, half human who will stop the angel war. There's other things but I dont want to explain because it might confuse you even more. Walken is still Walken and he has little to do here. Beals is too constipated in her role. Wong needs to speak up more and learn to act and Brittany Murphy as Izzy and Eric Roberts as the angel Michael are wasted in small roles. Tries too hard and turns way too sour. Where the hell is Jesus? You had Lucifer in the first one (A very good Viggo Mortensen) but they never bring Jesus in. why not? HE would of layed the smack down on Walken's ass."
2,"Sequels, who needs them?","Great, Superb, Magnificant are words I can use to describe The Prophecy. Boring, Terrible, Bad are words I can describe it's sequel. The Prophecy is a must see, while the sequel will only relate to dumb idiots. Christopher Walken failed to save the movie as he alone couldn't seem to keep the audience interested. Jennifer Beals worst performance ever."
1,I Want to Shhh This Film to Set It on a Fire.,"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 28/12: The good news about The Prophecy II is that Christopher Walken is in a horror flick. The bad news about The Craphecy II is that his talent is wasted. The film is just exactly like the original. That's it. Does it get increasingly tiresome to see a plot where the bad guy searches for something that will end life as we know it and dies in the end, failing to accomplish what he set out for? How many such movies are there? Ah, Jennifer Beals...the fraud from Flashdance. All in all, The Craphecy II is more of the same."
2,Check Your Brain at the Door,"The first film was pretty good and creepy but then they got all big headed and came up with a few sequels that damaged the original. There are some decent moments of horror in here but it all dies in the final moments of the film. If you can rent this cheap, go ahead, but I wouldn't pay above $1.00 for this."
2,"Why, oh why?","I gave The Prophecy II two stars because if I gave it one star I'd feel bad about myself.I rented this film the other night and I walked out of my den watching it.I'm not going to go into horrific detail; because I fear my detail might be more horrific than the film.Dimension Films seems to make two kinds of movies. Highly entertaining African-American comedies and these.On a side note, the producer made TREKKIES, which keeps him out of movie jail for another 5 years."
1,Amazingly horrible,"This sequel makes the Revenge of the Nerds series seem well written. The Prophecy was an interesting film and one of the most interesting scenes was of course, the climax of the film. In the final scene, the devil eats the heart of Christopher Walken's character and drags him to hell. Let me repeat that, he eats his heart. So how in the hell (and pardon the pun) is it even remotely possible that Christopher Walken is back for the sequel? I expect this sort of ""he was decapitated, but we froze his body and brought him back"" plot twist from a Soap Opera, but come on Walken. What were you thinking?"
3,Movie doesn't go anywhere,"If it was meant to be a sequel, the story went nowhere. I love Walken being cheeky with his minions. I can't imagine a movie leaving Archangel Gabriel a homeless mortal. They didn't know what to do with this movie. Why did they dredge up the Flashdance star to be in this. I thought she danced her way out of ""the biz""."
4,ITS ABOUT CHRISTOPHER WALKEN STUPID!!!,It doesnt matter what these Prophecy movies are really written about! the plots while interesting are secondary to the real reason these films exist!! It is infact a showcase for the brilliant humor of Christopher Walken! Watch these films and you see he is the main ingredient !! ENJOY HIM !!!
4,"Prophecy II, What?","If you have already seen the Prophecy you will probably not like this movie. The sequal doesn't really mix well with the first. I remember when I rented this movie when it first came out, I thought it could be good. It is a good movie, but should be called something else not Prophecy II. If you are a big Glenn Danzig fan this will go good with any Danzig collection."
4,This movie had so much potential ...,"All the movie really needed was a better plot. But it was really nice to see Russell Wong, and Jennifer Beals with some more acting jobs...especially Russell Wong!"
1,Didn't do to much for me.,"I didnt like this compared to the Steel Libido this sucks, and plus it has a delay, its been a couple times I've took it and I believe I felt a lil something the next day, weird, Not worth the buy."
3,Very soft and nice looking,The fabric feels soft and silky. Hope they wash well and look as good after. Great price.
2,"Filter as promised, not a 3 pack!","I am quite surprised by the fact that I was shipped ONE filter. The item description lead me to believe that this item was in a 3-pack. (Perhaps when it said Item Package Quantity: 3) So after the initial shock of realizing that my $60 went to purchase ONE filter instead of THREE I was quite annoyed.The only reason I purchased this was because I thought it was a great price, it turns out it absolutely wasn't. Now, aside from that the filter is fine and as described. I chose not to return it because I didn't want to waste the money on shipping, and my old filter was getting quite dirty.The filter is a hunter brand replacement, not a knock-off brand. (which at this point I would've preferred actually at the $60 price)If you are reading this and do not see the ""Item Package Quantity: 3"" on the page and are wondering what in the world I am talking about then just know that the item description was probably fixed.First time I have been burned by Amazon... Buyer Beware!"
1,This Filter Whistles: Do Not Buy It,"This filter whistles. Quite Flo, no way! It's not worth spending time for an RMA and paying another $10 to $15 to ship it back. I'll never buy a generic filter again from Amazon. What a waste of my time and hard-earned money."
5,Perfect,"Just what I wanted, fit perfectly. Just wish they didn't cost so much as I would like to change them more often."
4,Excellent mixed variety,"A great album. I guess it is classified as alternative rock, but such a narrow genre does not fit this set. It is a unique varied blend of all types of rock. Hearts for handlebars is a great track, as is save it for the judge."
1,Unplayable Video on Linux Systems,"This is not a review of the movie, but the medium. It appears to be unplayable (based on a sample of 2 DVDs) on linux based computers (vlc, smplayer, mplayer, xine, totem). It may be playable on Windows based operating systems (unknown). It did play on my dvd player."
2,I wasn't thunderstruck,"We went to see this one in the theater and I was pretty underwhelmed. I had two main problems with it:1) The romance with Natalie Portman was totally superfluous. It was only there because the focus groups say you have to have a romance. I know that's status quo but I'm getting tired of it.2) I hated the treatment of the Norse myth. Admittedly I should have expected that from Marvel, but the actual Norse legends are so much more...alive than what we get in this movie. It reduced archetypal gods to cardboard cutout aliens with the same names. Loki wasn't even a shadow of his namesake.The special effects were pretty good. It wasn't a terrible movie by any means, just a let down."
2,The God of Phfffffft,"It's hard to believe I watched the same movie everyone else did. The great mead swilling Norse God, warrior born and bred for what could have been a great movie had the grit been piled on by the ton. Instead what we get a film part X-Men (the opening fight was more danger room than anything else with characters acting more like inexperienced 20 somethings rather than gods) and part Love Story. Throw in the girl power performance of Portman, the near instant transformation of a God of War suddenly in touch with his soft and gooey side and enough over the top 'oooh shiny' and you've been delivered the latest in bland crowd pleasing hollywood bile.Seriously it was like watching Superman Returns all over again. This film was just another case of Follow the Money Makers. Romance, a shallow plot and a green screen. Here's to hoping Captain America doesn't (completely) follow in this piece of garbage's footsteps..."
4,Avengers build up,"Good movie as an Avengers build up, a way of knowing more about the character if you haven't read all of the comic books."
5,Awesome movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed the story, and I think the actors did an excellent job."
3,Thor,"I don't like super heroes/comic book characters movies but I was surprised that I actually thought Thor was decent.Chris Hemsworth is perfect as Thor.He is so charming in this movie.I think I liked it because it had to do with mythology and Thor was a God so it was a little different than your typical super hero movies.I thought the actor that played Loki was good also.I thought it had some funny scenes wich I liked because it wasn't serious the whole time.I liked the parts when he was on earth better than the Asgard scenes so I didn't like the first 35 minutes or so of the movie that much until he landed on earth and then the movie really picked up.I now am looking forward to seeing part 2 when it comes out.I recommend seeing this movie even if your not a fan of comic book/super hero movies,like me.You just might enjoy it.If I could I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,Action4sure,I liked this film although it was not a great film. Could have been much better with better writing. I bought it so I will continue to watch it again and again.
1,"Wow, really 4 star average?","Guess I just didn't get it along with my wife. I love these types of movies, ended up being bored to tears.No action, even less of a story and predictable as can be. Sorry but it sucked!"
1,"Terrible, just terrible","I must say that as a fan of the origonal commics this movie was a let down and then some. They are saping all the myth and magic from Marvel and turning it into a generic sci fi universe. Not only did they stray so far from the source material it is barely recognizable (not uncommon for commic book movie adaptations sadly) but the acting and plot are pure cheeze (and not in a good campy commic book sorta way). Anyway if you like the commics avoid, if you want to see a stargate norse gods rip off feel free to pick this one up."
2,Want a good movie? Watch TRON and not THOR ....,"Thor is weak. Too much fake and bad visual effects and ridiculos actions. What is the main actor, a Brad Pitt mixed with a ...??? And Natalie Portman is completely lost. Bad movie and I saw in Blu-ray."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I got this DVD (rather than the normal release) because it listed 'The Consultant' and bonus features as extras, which the normal DVD did not.The issue I have is not the extras, because it had them.The issue is that the extras are ONLY on Blue-Ray. ONLY. I don't have a Blue-ray player or a Blue-ray capable computer. I only bought this DVD set because of the extras, which I now cannot watch.The pictures listed here are too small for me to see that the extras were only available on the Blue-Ray version. I'm very disappointed; had this seller listed that the extras were only available on one of the formats I never would have spent this much money on a DVD."
4,Thor,"This is entertaining, nothing more, nothing less. The reason it is better than the other recent Marvel films is that it does not take itself very seriously. If it had, it would have been a painful experience. As it is, it is a cute film, with a hot leading man, and cheesey CGI. I hope to see more of Chris Hemsworth."
4,THOR,I just saw Thor it was worth watching. The plot is good also the people who played in the movie. I would not mind seeing it over and over.
3,Very predictable,This movie bored me. The story is so predictable that I could anticipate the dialogue before it was spoken and action sequences before they happened. 3D effects were okay.
3,Good Movie,Not the best 3D movie but it was a good movie.Legend of the Guardians-Owls of Ga'hoole (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)If you are new to 3d than this is the movie to get to get the full experience.
3,Thor,Watching Thor in 3D was awesome. Would recommend this movie to anyone looking for good 3D. Good storyline decent acting.
3,"Good film, but TOTALLY not HD through Instant Video","Film is good. However, the ""HD"" version isn't at all HD. and yes, my setup has played HD video from amazon instant video in the past (breaking bad, etc)."
4,Entertaining,A blend of Sword ad Scorcery and modern day science fiction that I enjoy. Based greatly on ancient myth and modern science.
3,"Four stars for the movie, minus one for the Blu-Ray formats","I suppose if you're a fan of the comics and expected the movie to be just like them, you might be disappointed in this movie. That seems to be the basis of a lot of the bad reviews. I liked this movie. It gave me just what I expected: fantasy action and cool special effects.However: I was unable to watch the Blu-ray and 3D versions of the movie. The movie would play, but there were no voices. And a silent version of a comic book action movie? Not a lot of fun.My BD player is a Sony BDP-S770. This is the only disc I've had any problems with. I've read some reviews here and elsewhere that say the copy protection makes the discs unplayable on some machines. Thanks for that, Paramount.Anyway, if you like good, mindless action flicks, give Thor a try. Just don't set your expectations too high."
2,Action Junkie And I Still Don't Like It,"It was OK, but I didn't like that it seemed a shallow setup for The Avengers. Movies should stand on their own first, and this one fell flat with a lack of Loki development and something else I can't quite put my finger on. It was just a perfect storm of unappealing camera work and acting quality I suppose. It wasn't as creative as I expected with this kind of story."
4,Great product,"I saw the movie in the theater and liked it. I thought it would be better with 3D, but it was just ok."
2,Mildy Entertaining,"I found the story to be choppy and without much to it. The action scenes were okay, but nothing that was amazing. To be fair, I watched it at home and I do not have the best sound-system, so maybe I missed out on some really loud epic moments? I really did not expect much when I rented this movie and I was not surprised with what I got."
3,No more Digital Copy and DVD combo packs!,No more combo packs. I wish manufacturers would give buyers the option to buy the Blu-ray only! My God I'm sick of purchasing 2 or more discs that I'll never use just to own a movie on Blu-Ray.
3,Entertaining,"Cool effects and entertaining story... Fairly predictable, but if you are looking for some light entertainment, this is fun to watch."
5,"It has Natalie, what can I say?","I've enjoyed all the movies I've seen with Natalie Portman in them. Also nice to see Kat Dennings. It was a fun movie. I need to read up more on Loki & the background to the plot. I have questions, such as, ""How do god's die?"" Will also be curious to see how Thor gets back to earth for later movies in the series."
4,Entertaining!,First time we saw this movie. Very entertaining and exciting. A little slow in the beginning but finished strong. I would recommend watching.
4,love this movie,"Ok, probably one of the best casting decisions in a long time. Wathcing him go from strong and cocky to strong and noble was really nice and a great touch. Nice reflection of my childhood images of these other worlds and the gods that inhabit them."
4,THor 2: Only in Asgard,"Every time this movie was in Asgard and had gods fighting gods, it was great. The scope then shrank down to almost nothing when it was on Earth and felt like an ""Avengers"" prequel. If they made a sequel and it just stayed in Asgard, that would be awesome. Idris Elba steals every scene he's in, but I really liked Hemsworth as Thor as he was funny. STAY IN ASGARD!"
4,Thor,"Really liked this movie. Kenneth B directing gave it almost a Shakespeare temperature. The special effects were great but the development of the relationships of the people was terrific. Chris Hemsworth is a beautiful ""bod"" but so much more. Love his voice and he's a good actor. There's something that coemes from him as a person. Feel like you could discuss politics or feelings with him. Life on the outback and his parents definitely centered both him and Liam.His wife's a lukcy woman.Casting was perfect. Loved all of them but Loki is my favorite - a tough role to project an increasingly bad guy image but still be at least a little likeable."
5,Thor 3D,"Thor 3D came in promptly, I wanted to watch this and Captain America in preparation for The Avengers, 3D was good, audio was great! Story was good, Thor is for sure a keeper for my 3D collection."
4,Thor,Started out a little slow and lagging...but then was ok. Now we know there is going to be another one...
3,Decent enough.,"This movie was decent. It was worth Amazon's 99 cent weekend sale price. I didn't expect much with the Nordic god premise, but I generally approve of Marvel/superhero flicks, so I was willing to give this a try. I really didn't have any expectations. I am familiar with Kat Dennings and Natalie Portman, so I was overall looking forward to this movie. And going in with no real expectations at all, I must say that I wasn't dissatisfied. It was good enough. It wasn't great or amazing, but it was entertaining."
4,One of the better comic to screen adaptations,"To be fair, I am NOT a huge Thor fan. I probably hadn't thought much about the character since I was a kid 40 years ago. I do follow some old and new comics/story lines and I had a general idea who Thor was, but that is all. So, to me, this was a decent movie. I am not one to compare every detail of a 2 hour long movie to a 50 year comic franchise. As a stand alone movie and introduction to the characters, I thought it worked well. It was not overly serious and at least the movie got going with some action early on. A big problem in a lot of these super-hero movies is that you have to create the hero, get the cast of characters together, etc. While I am not a big CGI fan, the effects here were, for the most part, good and not dark and murky. Still the blue/grey skinned villians looked to be rip offs from Avatar's characters. As you can expect, its set up for an obvious sequel."
5,thor,"WHEN ORDERING THE MOVIE IT SAID IT WOULD BE NEXT DAY ARRIVAL IF ORDERED WITHIN 5 HOURS. THAT I DID BUT I FIND OUT IT WON'T BE HERE TIL THE 3RD OF OCT. 8 DAYS LATER. WHATS UP WITH THAT? WE WERE SITTING ANXIOUSLY TO WATCH IT, OH WELL."
4,Thor (That's Mighty Thor you - Midgardians)!,"As I had read Mighty Thor comics as a kid, I wasn't prepared for:1. Who they had playing Heimdall (he was a Norseman-type, granted that Hogun was an asiatic type)and2. Jane Foster's actual job (she was a Nurse, not a Astro-Physicist)So, I was down on the movie before it even started.and3. Who they had playing Thor (never heard of Chris Hemsworth)The results?I was wrong - way wrong!Idris Elba was a convincing and compelling guardian of the Rainbow Bridge (Heimdall)!Natalie Portman performed well as Jane Foster!Chris Hemsworth is Mighty Thor! I hope he doesn't worry about the type-casting that can occur in roles of this nature, because I can't wait to see what they do next with his character! But, I would think that the Marvel Universe has it's hands full with Hulk, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and on and on...Go see Thor and enjoy yourself (like I did...)I grant thee, (Mighty) Thor...Stars that number...FIVE! (Thus speaketh Dolen!)"
3,should have rented it,"I thought this movie was ok. Way better than Captain America though. The effects were top notch, and you can expect nothing less from a Marvel movie these days. Substance not so much though. Any way, could have saved myself $24 and just rented it. As a movie collector I like to buy movies that I can watch over and over again. This is probably going to collect dust on my rack."
2,Instant Video Review Only,"I love Thor, it's great fun.... However, resist the temptation for instant gratification and don't purchase the Instant Video Option. The sound quality is horrible. The music and the effects totally drown out the dialog. It's really apparent at the beginning with Odin's narration. Just wait a couple of days for the DVD to arrive. You'll be glad that you did."
2,No Storyline,"I was so disappointed when I saw this. The special effects are really neat, but the storyline is pretty much non-existent. Thor is a cocky prince, smarts off to his dad, loses power and sent to earth. Meets girl, they fall in love after two minutes, then it's the final battle. There should have been more. Just seemed way too short."
2,Poor script,"I'm very disappointed with this movie. I've read positive reviews and have seen reviews at Amazon, but after the viewing I wonder why I believed them. Video and sound is OK, but the story... It could be better if not such a poor script. There are a lot of absurdities, not a fantasy things but just nonsense. For example, Thor came to people on the Earth from the fantasy world, he don't know where he is and even how to cross the street not being knocked down by the car, but the next morning he is in the kitchen and he is making a breakfast for a girl like he is a well-behaved model husband. What the hell! The story itself is too thin and shot. During the movie me with my wife were waiting for something special that could happen, something epic, some development of the story, but while we were waiting the movie ended. We just spend almost 2 hours pointlessly."
4,Thor - Another Gem in the Marvel Series,"Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is outstanding. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic."
2,"Predictable, good special effects","Should have been a much longer movie so that the changes in the lead characters could have been more believable. The plot is as old as the hills, and the overall acting was not the best. Still, the action scenes were very well done, and the visuals are striking. Great movie for a rainy weekend."
2,RENTAL READY? BE CAREFUL,"FIRST OFF, I loved the movie. While purists will be in dismay with how Thor and Asgard are portrayed, how the story is interpreted for today's audience and incorporating Thor in a ""scientific"" way in order to put him in the modern Marvel movies I felt was creative. HOWEVER, THE BLURAY QUALITY leaves a LOT to be desired on the RENTAL READY version at least. There are NO visible scratches on my disc but three times the disc would skip, stop, and go bubbly all over the place. If I put the machine on SLOW forward I could at least see what parts I was missing, but no sound obviously. I don't know for certain if its a problem with my machine or with the disc--so if you haven't had any problems, let me know please and I can change the review. Thanks for reading."
4,Another Marvel!,"Thor was a good film with great special effects. Some parts of the film were underdeveloped at times and the earth scenes with thor less gelling and believable than when he was on Asgard. Most of Thors stay was on his home planet of Asgard and a bit on the Ice-giants planet. The acting was pretty good, the story was well executed but the love scene between Natalie Portman and Chris Helmsworth was pretty forgettable. Overall I enjoyed this film and it was fun! Cant wait to see what they do with Thor 2!"
2,"has potential, but over dramatic silliness prevails","Thor has such great potential, but this movie strains so hard to be so amazing it gives itself a stroke. The acting is ok, but the story is so simple MST3K will have a go at this one day. EFX cannot replace a well rounded story. The story has structure, but tries too hard to make itself great. I am tired of the look of modern movies being determined by average crap concept artist who use photoshop and one trick lighting techniques. Look to the real world for inspiration, it is far more amazing than all the garbage, backlit, brown and teal concept art you are basing your work on."
2,Great Expectations,"I'm a really big Marvel fan so my hopes for this feature were very high. I was somewhat disapointed. The action was pretty good but it really needed more story. The plot was so thin you could read the paper through it. This is clearly just a vehicle leading up to ""THE AVENGERS"". Oh, be sure to watch the trailer at the end of the credits. It honestly was the best part.This gets 2 stars ONLY because, well, it IS the God of Thunder."
5,"This movie, I like it. ANOTHER!!!!!!!","I have to be honest that I really wasn't expecting this to be as great as it was. But, I'm so glad I gave it a chance because it is one of my favorite movies of 2011. Great story, action, acting and Kenneth Branagh did an excellent job directing this movie. Too bad he won't be back to direct the sequel because he seemed to really get the characters.As far as the 3D goes though, it was pretty FLAT. I'm not a big fan of ""converted"" 3D and this movie is a pretty good example of why. Sure there were a couple of scenes with some pretty good depth, but most of the film was pretty flat."
4,DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE-VERY GOOD,"I would never have watched this movie had it not been for the good reviews. I would have thought it to be just another cheap,comuter generated special effects movie. It is a very good movie with a well written script. It has two stories within one. I cannot believe I rented it totally due to reviews. Glad I did. Highly recommend."
5,Great movie!!,The movie is fantastic especially in Blu ray. Action scenes are amazing and the quality is perfect! Highly recommended! Great movie for your collection.
2,Boring and lame!,"The story wasn't all that believable, even in the mythos of Thor. The acting was even worse. They never should have made this. Thor could have been overlooked for the Avengers."
5,DON'T MISS THIS EPIC FILM !,"I loved this movie and highly recommend to anyone looking to be thoroughly entertained!Not an Oscar winner, mind you, but a solid nearly 2 hours of movie excitement and entertainment for all!Chris Hemsworth nails it as Thor with his charisma and it factor~Not to be missed - as it already builds the anticipation for Part II - $450mil workld wide theatre box office tells it like it is ! WOW!enjoykal~"
3,not enough,"solid film. decent acting, beautiful effects and fairly funny at times. my one gripe about this movie without any spoilers are the main action scenes. they moved too fast, no focus and too short.Thor compared to recent comic movies fail to live up to the level that the first iron man brought or the dark knight. this movie could've been great, had all the potential but wasn't quite sure what it wanted to be. still looking forward to captain amereica and the avengers though."
4,ok movie,"met expectations. There were a few loose ends. Destroying the access to earth doesn't allow Thor to go to earth anymore, right?"
5,"Great Movie, Timely delivery","I love this movie, but I'm a fan of Marvel movies. Delivery wasn't a problem. Came on time, I enjoy it still today."
5,Thor & the mighty Hammer!,The mighty Thor and his hammer is virtually indestructible! Great story and overall cast. Awesome special effects. Can't wait to see Thor when he joins up with Th Avengers!
4,Comic Book Fun at its Finest,"A very different take on the old Marvel formula. Thor transports you to a world of fantasy and myth rather than the normal Marvel movie realm of science fiction in a modern world. If you don't take it seriously, then you'll find it fun, entertaining, and at parts moving. The special effects and epic landscapes are brought to near-life by BluRay."
2,It's was intresting...until Natalie Portman's character showed up.,"I didn't like this movie. It's really prediable and sort of boring. Besides thor and his father, there is no chemistry in anyone relationship. The movie started out pretty good, but after he was sent down to earth we found out that Thor and Portman's character had zero chemisrty and the brother twist was revealed, it got really boring. Natalie Portman is a sure way to dull up your movie. ZZZZZ"
2,"Bad 3D, good movie","The 3D effects are basically non-existent. Very dark with glasses, no pop-outs. Blu-ray version is fine(2D). The movie was not originally shot in 3D."
2,Borderline awful,"I only give it two stars because I like the genre, but this thing is pretty sorry. The plot line is completely predictable and phoned in. I mean, what's with Marvel and all this ""magic ice"" and ""super energy source"" stuff ? It's such a lame crutch and cliche. Can't they think of anything else ? The action sequences were either completely over the top and blurry (Ice Giant fight), or totally silly and uninteresting (Earth fight). The climax was so confusing and ham-fisted, I just gave up. Like most recent cinematic offerings, this movie offers zero suspense, mystery, or intrigue. The idea that Thor was longing for Portman's character, at the end, was ridiculous. The movie developed zero foundation for such a longing. Overall, one of the worst superhero flicks I have ever seen."
2,"Lots of CGI, Poor Acting and Script","I had expectations low enough that it took seeing a 4-star rating on Amazon to decide to watch Thor. Mistake.It's tough for any movie to recover when the hero and title character is an unsympathetic lightweight. And when his love interest is supposed to be a passionate scientist, but she's played to look like a high school junior who's moderately excited by an undefined class project, the movie's probably gone.Good special effects and sets, a C- script, a good-looking and well-shot setting somewhere in the American Southwest, and you have your basic 2-star fantasy flick luring people in with over-generous reviews.Save your money."
2,Looks like a Hallmark Pilot,"Poor put upon Odin (Anthony Hopkins) King of Asgard, must now pass the throne to one of his two sons, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), or Loki (Tom Hiddleston). However they must both show that they are worthy and capable. Will Thor change his arrogant ways? Is Loki everybody's friend or a sneaky leader of a cabal?Let's watch the story as it unfolds.I have a strange feeling that I've seen this story before, and before, and before, and before. Apply a cheap veneer that was really never any part of the Edda; throw in a tad of Shakespeare, sprinkled with Hallmark music, distract us with Natalie Portman and voilà.Thor will return in ""The Avengers""The Heroes of Asgard: Tales from Scandinavian Mythology"
5,Great movie,"Such a great movie. It was done well and cast very well. They couldn't have picked a better person to play Thor. It's also the perfect super hero movie for kids. Even though there's violence (which honestly you can see in a G movie), there are no inappropriate scenes in the movie. It's a good wholesome film and has a great premise. I have a new respect for Thor."
3,Cheesy dialog and a few awkward moments,Several awkward moments combined with persistently cheesy dialog that detracted from my overall enjoyment of the movie. The SFX were amazing tho.
4,Movie great - case damaged,When I received this item there was a large cut all the way through the cover which I was not happy about but luckily the movie played fine so it wasn't that big of a deal.
5,Great 3D disc,A very good film with great graphics for the Avengers series. Very impressive scenery and cast. Definitely worth the investment for the home collection.
2,Missing the DVD Combo+Digital Copy disc.,I surprised that Amazon didn't check the contents of the disc. I received mine with one missing disc in the bluray case.
1,More Hollywood special effects. No quality,First and foremost: Natalie Portman is no actress. The Academy Awards lost all credibility when she was awarded an Oscar for Black Swan. This film has nothing to offer except special effects if you like that sort of thing. And Athony Hopkins must be desperate for work to make this debacle. Reminded me of a poor version of Star Man.
1,Thor is terrible,"I went and saw this movie at the dollar theater and I was still upset that I wasted my money, that is how bad this movie is"
1,yellow blur,I downloaded this movie and it was mostly a yellow blur like it was supposed to be in 3d without the glasses only the listing says nothing about 3d. So what could have been a great movie but I could not tell. Someone at Amazon screwed up.
1,Why?,Why would I want to watch this for $15 when I can buy it for $20? I don't even know if I like it. I can watch Iron Man for $6 and buy it for $15. What is the point? I guess I'll just have to wait until the pricing algorithms they are using actually start reflecting reality.
4,new thor 2011,"this was good only because it had some good new ideas and different and wasnt in dark night scene, were you cant see much, i think it is worth seeing. it had the love affiar with a human and and had some comedy and some special fight scenes."
1,Kk,"Every tab on the inside of this movie was broken off and it looks like someone just shook it for hours straight. It is watchable, but skips.. Very disappointed."
2,Thorific,"""Spectacular"" over states it. Impressive casting and bad hair. Good set designs here and there. Laughable plastic costume armor. Nothing here that is clever, creative, scary, inspiring, thought provoking, humorous, sexy, intriguing, wondrous, exciting...........what did I leave out? Oh.....good.Well what can you expect from the Gods these days anyway? Hunky Thor was nothing but annoying and silly throughout and the evil demon alien bad guys were about as tiresome as the rest of the CG monsters. What a waste of a good comic book character."
2,thor,"i throught it was cheap it;s start out great then it turns sour , morden day thor then back since fiction , thats where i thought it got cheap ,,i would not recommoned this movie to nobody..........."
3,"could have been much,much better...","I never read the comics so just watched this as a movie. I felt that it needed more explanations of the world, and more filling out of almost all of the characters. The acting was good but Natalie Portmans talents were wasted.I liked the art and art direction. The fights were well chorepgraphed. The script could have ,as i said, explained more about well, everything. Had it done so, i would have liked this much more..."
5,HE MAN of 2011,Kind of remind me of the movie Masters of the Universe in the late 80's with Dolph Lundgren as He Man and the lead star. I love both movies in their own style.
1,"shiny outside, hollow inside","I am a casual comic reader, not a fanatic, and not a Thor follower. I was interested in learning more, and was intrigued that K.B. took the helm as director.Suffice it to say, Henry the Fourth this is not. Unfortunately Thor is much closer to his bewilderingly confused stab at Frankenstein.Watching this movie is like sitting through a ""story development meeting"" ... you can almost hear the commentary of the executives: insert action sequence here ... insert emotional speech there ... another explosion here. The dialogue is formula, drab, predictable, and at times descends to groaningly stupid.The expected mix of wooden acting, followed by forced and fake drama, mixed together with some pretty visuals. This film is like the shiny action hero toys on the shelf at Wal-Mart. Shiny plastic outside: hollow inside.Thankfully the violence did not cross the line between spectacle and horror. This is a movie you can show to pre-teens, perhaps, and not feel too bad about it."
2,Why isn't this movie any good?,"+ Good Cast+ Good Character (B level super hero veiled in mystery for many of the unitiated comic book readers such as I)+ Big Budget+ Lot's of bad and great super-hero movies in the very recent past to take ques from.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why is this movie so bad?I am not a comic book guy, so I can't discuss any narrative issues, but I struggled to keep my eyes open for the last 2/3 of the movie. The story & its characters were weak, and I found the special effects to be bright, shiney, and stuff I saw in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the Dark Knights & X-Men (First Class in particular) and don't understand why these two very successful but different movies aren't setting the pace for those making the Green Lantern, Thor, & Captain America all but unwatchable. I am very nervous about the Avengers."
4,About the best you can do with a live-action Thor movie.,"When I heard Marvel was going to make a live-action Thor movie, I just rolled my eyes and scoffed. I figured there was no way they could pull that off. How could they possible present Asgard? How would they tie in Norse mythology to the present-day society? What actor could possible play the title character? Wouldn't the whole movie just come across as cheesy to mature movie-goers?I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie came across as much better than I had expected. With a good mix of action, comedy, and crowd-pleasing special effects, this movie did what I thought could not be done: Make Thor appeal to an audience outside of comic book fans. Well done Marvel! Now, just don't screw things up with the sequel!"
4,The God of Thunder!,"This movie definitely makes it onto my favorites list! Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, does a great job with making the role his. While I would not rate this movie better than Iron Man or even Captain America, it does meet standards. As for the actual product - who couldn't love it. With the blu ray 3D, blu ray, DVD, and digital copy I can watch this movie anywhere! And with the money I saved on Amazon, I can get more of my favorite movies. Bottom line, if you love superhero movies or have a desire to be Thor than buy this movie!"
1,Terrible Movie,"I don't write many reviews; however, all of the good reviews for this movie have compelled me to write a review. This movie is the most boring superhero movie of recent years. The plot and actors are completely uninspired. I don't look forward to seeing this character in the Avengers. Save your money; borrow this movie from someone if you really feel that it is necessary to watch it."
1,Stinker,"I wish I could have given it ZERO stars. This is a total waste of time. If you look through Amazon, I am sure you can find something else to watch."
1,THOR = BORE,EPIC FAIL THOR PUT ME TO SLEEP I WISH MARVEL WOULD MAKE THER MOVIES MORE DARK... I HOPE DARK WORLD IS DARK LOL
1,disgruntled,I bought this but never got it and don't know where else to ask for my credit card to be uncharged.Order number: D01-7101438-7309022 Thank you
3,It's okay,"Wasn't great but glad I saw it just to understand the avengers movie better, but not that great by itself."
4,Good,Surprisingly good. This movie was way better than I thought it would be. I would watch it again. Overall a pretty good movie
4,Thor Movie 2011,"Movie was really good! Actor played the role of the iconic Viking God of Thunder very well and the movie was a combination of the comic book and norse myth. It was a fun movie full of action, humor mixed in with sentimentality!"
4,Loved Thor's Story!,"I waited a long time to watch this one. I was expecting some cliché super hero movie with the usual cheap thrills. Not the case here. The story really helps this movie be great. I love how Thor is humbled when everyone knows he is the strongest and the most cunning of them all. But he was far too arrogant and ill-considered to be handed the throne. During his humiliation as a human being, I had several laughs, especially the scene in the hospital! Thor was also well casted. Everyone played their role well. There are MANY super hero movies out there right now, and this one DEFINITELY deserves your attention. Give it a try. Most people will like it. I'll be getting it on blu ray pretty soon!<NEWS> Thor will be making another appearance in the movie ""The Avengers"", which comes out this summer in theaters (2012). And I've read that they are working on a script for ""Thor 2"". I hope they don't ruin this super hero by making him all warrior and no integrity in the second movie."
4,Great movie,this is a great little movie. I've been a fan of the super heroes since I was very young and nothing but comic books were available.
2,not as described,I ordered Two Disc Blu-Ray DVD combo but all i got was the Blu-Ray... not worth the money when falsely advertised
3,Thor bore,"How can so many brilliant people get together and make such a fiasco? I could only take about 20 minutes of the eye-popping special effects before I started shutting down. All I ask is for are some real characters I can care about, a reasonably, lively creative script, and some kind of slightly original story. Maybe I shouldn't criticize because I did only do most of the exposition, but I could see pretty clearly where this baby was going: right down the drain on a multi-million dollar thrill ride. Not even masterful actors like Hopkins can save messes like these. Compare him in this to what he did to us in Silence of the Lambs. Well, there are movies, and then there are just films. Maybe Hollywood should declare a moratorium on special effects for a spell. You can throw all the perfume in the world on a pig, but he's still going to stink."
4,Surprised!,"Not being a comic book fan, all I know about Thor was that he was a Norse god with a giant hammer he used to beat up bad guys and fly. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but when I went to the theater, WOW! It was AMAZING! Extremely epic, fantastic acting, and one of the best scores of the year and great visual effects. I saw it again the next weekend and can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray. Tom Hiddleston was the best actor of the entire film (though they were all great)."
5,Great modern superhero movie!,"Thor was the best superhero movie of 2011, in my opinion, and there were quite a few to compete with it. It was amazing in 3D in the movie theater. The movie looks great on Blu-Ray at home. I am a huge Natalie Portman fan, and her performance does not disappoint. There are also a lot of other great performances in the film, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin. I highly recommend this film, and I'm looking forward to the advancement of the story in the upcoming Avengers film this summer."
4,Another good one,Love the movie and the quality of the Video plus the movie is a fun relaxing movie once again no regerts.
5,Solid Movie,"Thor started out strong, and it seemed to be able to hold its own for the entire duration. The main character doesn't evolve much, but not all characters need to grow into their roles. Some fit it well to begin with."
3,Next time stay in Asgard,"Kenneth Branagh does court intrigue well, so really, after Thor was banished to earth, the film should have remained in Asgard and documented the local politics (you know, like a period piece).Asgard, with its starry backdrops, was a happening place. Idris Elba was cool. My daughter put it well: ""I want to go back there!"" But no, sweetie, I had to explain, Kenneth wants us to return to the earth, the boring place with two dimensional characters that made us rent this video in the first place, so we could listen to Thor, God of Thunder, ask ""Deal?"" and then wait an aeon to hear Natalie Portman reply, ""Deal!"" No shortage of painful nonsense sapping the life out of this film faster than a Yodenheim frost jacket.I agree with the other viewer that the opportunity to show Loki's mischievous side was lost. All we saw was hurt, spoiled & vengeful.Maybe Ken's a busy guy... but c'mon, he did Henry V! I keep expecting more from him."
2,Can't believe Natalie Portman consented to this....,"Although parts were entertaining, the overall movie was just plain dumb and silly at times. I usually like this type of movie but I would recommend you watch something else...there are much better ways to spend your time."
5,Love it!,This movie was great. It's a perfect introduction to Thor the character and his story. I will probably watch it over and over!
4,Much better then expected.,I didn't expect much from this movie. It ended up being much better then expected and even made me laugh out loud twice. Great movie!
5,A Great Favorite,"Director Kenneth Branagh delivers a visually stunning movie, boasting a thoughtful yet funny plot brought to life by an incredible cast. For me, the father-son triad of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) really make this film a treat. Anthony Hopkins owns the floor as the King of Asgard, as always; his chill-inducing banishment speech to Thor has been practically immortalized. Even as a spoiled brat warrior prince, Thor is fun and likable; and when he comes into his own with humility and sacrifice, you can't help but admire him. As for Loki, if you can't appreciate the subtlety and finesse with which Tom Hiddleston manipulates every facet of this character, if you can't sympathize with the pain Loki expresses when begging and screaming to know his true identity, then you have no heart.A must-see, whether you plan on watching The Avengers or not."
3,Left me wanting more,"Great video quality, great sets, good acting, but the plot was created to make sequels.I'd recommend this if you don't like closure to films you watch."
3,Good superhero action movie,"Although not the best superhero movie, this is an entertaining movie that moves along at a good pace. The video and audio quality are very good, nice movie to add to your collection."
3,faded thunder,Good graphics but the plot quickly faded to a poor little rich boy seeking redemption and the ending was a quick cut off.
5,"Fun, Action-Packed Movie","I ordered Thor for my 13 year old son through Amazon.com for the excellent price, but I have to admit the story was fun and the actors were terrific. Beginning with an episode depicting Thor's origins as a mythological god, the story then picks up at Thor's banishment to Earth and his relationships with humans. This story is one of the Marvel comic hero stories which introduce The Avengers one at a time (Captain America is another Marvel superhero from last year). The story has many action scenes and Chris Hemsworth is delightful as the displaced god of thunder. My son watches it way too much, but I am glad to watch it when he gets to choose the movie for our monthly movie slumber party."
4,The God of Thunder,"Overwhelming viewing experience; idiotic story; nice action; has not much to do with the Nordish sagas, but was fun to watch (only once, and now the DVD is in my file cabinet.)"
3,"I'm Sorry, But This Movie Didn't Do Much For Me.","I'm not much of a Thor fan either, but this was anything but awesome. Sure it had its good moments here and there, but it did not come across as a THOR movie. His total look, although mildly impressive was incorrect. No helmet, facial hair, hair not long and blonde enough. And no Donald Blake. How can you have a Thor movie with out Donald Blake? Even though the costume was WAAAAAYYY wrong in The Incredible Hulk Returns, Eric Kramer was a much better Thor than this guy. If you have already seen this and enjoyed it I won't dispute your opinion, but if you are like me with a basic knowledge of the Thor character and his comic book and/or cartoon mythology this one may just disappoint."
2,It's a Thor Subject,Ranks down there with the Punisher and Ang Lee's Hulk. If you wanna have more fun go watch Limitless or Paul. I realize we are still in the Dark Ages and all but the whole point of escapism is just that... to escape a dumbed-down mindless 2 dimensional planet ... you want action watch Chocolate or Ip Man or something that doesn't just imitate the vacuum of deep space.Rule #1: When watching a bad movie ALWAYS be prepared to spend another two hours finding a suitable antidote flick to cleanse the cerebral palate of the bland taste of being teased by the promise of infinite technological possibilities juxtaposed against the never ending acceptance of cheese.... (& processed at that)
2,Waste of talent,"Branagh, Portman, Hopkins - they've all done great things. This isn't one of them, however.Effects are only soso. That ""Bifrost Bridge,"" for example, might have looked awesome before anyone ever played Myst, but looks a bit steampunk by today's standards, and the rest of Asgard rises to the same unimpressive standard. (That assassin-bot was pretty cool, though.) Acting? Well, technically, I suppose that's what you'd call it. Thor and Loki both came across as shallow, childish, and mercurial. In fact, among the Aesir at least, the only one who really interested me was Heimdall. Given such weak central characters, even very good work in the supporting roles (and there was some) couldn't save this.Branagh's done a fair job with Shakespeare's work. That skill just doesn't transfer to what should have been a glorious and heroic effect-fest. I don't recommend this one.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
1,"1 hour, 55 minutes too long!","I really liked Batman Begins, Capt. America, Spiderman, Daredevil, but this one is sickening. cheezy to say the least. not into the main actor at all, the stupid plot, or dumb dialog. I think I've gotten my point across. except for the beginning, middle and ending, I guess it was tolerable."
3,Silly. Senseless. Skadi was right. And Odin would puke.,"OMG, America! Cradle of cinema, home to Hollywood! Is this what it comes down to ... a $200 million comic book? You can feel your IQ falling each minute of this computer-made flick. If you really like mythology & sci-fi, I suggest a book -- ""Ilium"" by Dan Simmons. Read it, & you'll realize that ""Thor"" is just a big yawn aimed at selling popcorn."
4,Good Superhero flick!,"I've been waiting to see this for quite some time and it was worth the wait! One of the best ""Avenger"" movies yet!"
5,Thor,I received the dvd is a timely manner. It got here before the estimated date. I was able to track the shipment.
3,Too damned dark to see,"Hi,This could have been a really good movie. It should have been. But unfortunately, played on a normal telly, during the day its simply too dark to see half the movie,and that really spoiled it for me. I don't like paying good money to see radio.I give it three stars because the half I could see was good. Maybe, if I had the money and had bought a plasma telly, then sat in a dark room at night with the lights off it would have been better.Cheers."
3,Only ok,"I liked the other Marvel movies but this one doesn't really mach up, it entertained me but didn't leave me wanting more. The 3D is good, picture and sound were perfect but I think the writing could have been better.Natalie Portman is a nice addition but I don't think this is a role that she will be tremendously proud of, not her fault , more the fault of mediocre writing.I would recommend you rent this movie rather than buy it."
3,A letdown,"I was really looking forward to this movie. The previews made it look like it was going to be really good. I am also a fan of comic book movies. The plot was not well developed and seemed to just drag on with no real interesting points. Hemsworth was perfect for this role but the movie itself was disappointing. The love story aspect was a joke, not developed at all, they barely see each other a few times and then he is professing his love for her. After looking to watching this movie for months, I found myself wanting to just turn it off before it was over."
5,Best Kiss,"the kiss near the end of the movie, is undoubtedly one of the best kisses in movie history :)"
2,Average 3D and overall fairly poor movie,"The filming and shots in this film mostly do not lend themselves to project 3D. Not exactly sure why it is just not that impressive. And the story is really weak. Not even remotely close to as good as Ironman. The love interest that develops between Thor and Natalie Portman makes no sense. There is nothing that happens to explain it other than they are attractive specimens. Had high hopes for something with Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russo and Natalie Portman in it but it was not to be."
4,A bit too heavy on the Shakespeare Tragedy,"What works in Ironman? It is a FUN movie. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It has action, comedy, and excellent pacing. Too bad Thor did not learn that lesson...it wanted to be the Dark Knight, but did not have the gravitas to pull that off. The parts were all there but the package seemed incomplete."
5,Awesome Movie,"For those who like the avengers, this movie does not disappoint! I was amazed with all the graphics and special effects, and the plot and story line are awesome as well."
5,Good movie,"I really didn't know much about Thor before watching this movie, but found this movie to be exciting and enjoyable...everything a super hero movie should be."
3,Decent,I felt the movie was a bit boring and overly sci-fi. I wasn't drawn in to the characters rage or struggles because it just wasn't exciting or engaging enough.
5,Great gift for the super hero junkie!,"We love the super hero movies and are impatiently waiting for the next one to come out! Thor is one of my favorite heros and movie. I bought this for a great price for my daughter and she is thrilled. She can play it on her dvd player, blu-ray player, computer and tablet."
1,For pre-teen boys,"I only got this because of Kenneth Branagh, but really not interested in this type of movie. Very similar to ""Transformers"" which also bored me to tears. I'm an adult with an education and this is for young boys who want some mindless action and little ""wow"" moments. Really hated this film. And the melodramatic music was laughable as well."
1,Worst Superhero Movie Ever.,"I regretted paying even the discounted ticket price to see this movie. It disappointed me in every aspect. The action was weak and nearly non-existent. The acting was garbage. The settings were stupid. Asgard? As if. Anyone who worships the elder gods and all-father Odin, as I do, would be ashamed and disgraced by this weak display of film making."
3,Thor the Mighty,"This movie had some great high lights,fight scenes and who does not love Natalie Portman. It however fell flat for me in the end as they tried to wrap up the movie. It felt too fast for all the story content they tried to jam in. It was a necessary movie because of the character Loki."
4,Granddaughter's Gift,My granddaughter had seen this movie and put it on her Christmas list since she liked it so well. So I'm a grandmother in good standing.
3,Not what I particularly like to watch,It was ok but probably would not want to see it again. I usually like whatever Natalie Portman is in.
2,Silly flashy yet boring,I only watched about 20 minutes of this before loosing interest. The best I can say is I stream it for free.
2,Predictable,Really should be a comic book fan before watching this or skip it. Just could not stay interested in it.
2,"Thor--watching this movie made by brain ""Thor"".","Did not care much for this movie but if you like campy movies it is OK. The acting is not very good but if viewed as a ""fun"" movie it is likeable.. My wife movies and she would watch paint dry if it was in a movie form. She lasted through 10 minutes."
4,enjoying,"I really really enjoyed watching this movie it was sad, funny and I loved all the action pack and graphics"
3,Meh,Not bad for free on Amazon Instant Videos. At least watching it made the Avengers movie make some more sense.
3,Decent For What It Is.,"It is a movie based on a comic book, and done in a bland way. No great acting here, no sit on the edge of your seat thrills. Just a mindless romp through the history of Marvel's Thor character. There were attempts at playfulness, but they fell flat. The movie had some nice special effects, but even they were somewhat juvenile by today's standards. Although streaming it for free as a Prime Member was not a complete let down, had I paid money to see it I would have been disappointed. On the other hand, children around the ages of 7 to 10 years old might really like this movie."
3,"Not bad, good entertainment.","I did not hold much hope after the recent superhero failures but I was very entertained by this movie.Being honest I'm not a fan of Portman, however Chris Hemsworth plays Thor well and makes this worth watching. My rating of 3 would be 4 but Portman's acting as usual drags it down one, too bad her best work was in Leon at the age of 13.Certainly one of the better superhero movies and worth adding to your collection or at least renting."
2,"Watchable, Glad I Didn't Pay For It In The Theater!","The first 10 minutes were pretty bad, not done well at all, but then it picked up some. There was some good action and special effects but the movie was very predictable. The acting was average to poor even for Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman so you know the director was at fault there. The military handling was very cheesy and not done well. The ending was not so good and setup for a sequel obviously. At best this movie might rate a 5 out of 10, AT BEST, and certainly isn't better than the X-Men series or even Iron Man for that matter. So it was watchable but I would toot anyone's horn over it."
3,Sort of boring,The 3D effects were not great. I was not that impressed. The movie was a little long and boring. It was a little stupid. Even for a comic book type movie.I thought it would be better given the reviews. I liked Captain America 3D better.
4,Awesome,Story was well told. Special effects were superb but not over powering. Ending left room for a sequel or segway into another franchise.
2,"Nothing about this movie is ""OK""","The best thing about Thor is South Park made a hilarious parody, also ripping the history channel. We couldn't tell if Natalie Portman was terrible or if the movie just sucked. Also no Samuel L. Lame."
2,Too predictable.,"I love all of the superhero movies, but I didn't get the drama and suspense of an Ironman or Spiderman movie. I thought the plot was very predictable, the sets were overwhelming the acting, and I didn't really care about any of the characters that much. Except for the shirtless Chris Hemsworth, it was a boring two hours.THOR"
2,Real Bad,"I am surprised with the overwhelming number of good and very good reviews for this movie.I thought the script and acting were weak.I think its better than one star, but not by much."
2,Thor - maybe should have remained in comic book form...,"I purchased the Blueray version of this movie and the video was excellent, sound OK. The storyline is just so predictable, with some really second-rate acting from the 'hero'. Continuity was questionable in a couple of scene changes. I love scifi and epic type movies, but this one was really boring and I would not recommend it, unless you are a huge fan and need it for your collection. It really deserves only one star but at least I did not fall asleep before the end, so it was borderline interesting enough for 2."
5,Thor,I love this type of movie. It wasdone very well. my service from amazon was great. Thor is a good movie to watch and enjoy.
5,Thor,We loved this movie when we saw it on the big screen and were excited to acquire it when it came out for sale.
5,I Think I Hear Thunder,when i first saw iron man and saw the post credit scene i knew immediately that they would be also making thor. great story and great way to introduce thor leading up to the big team up in 2012
4,Great movie! A worthy adaptation of the character!,"The movie itself is one of Marvel's best. Thor provides an excellent segue into The Avengers. Hemsworth makes for a believable Thor. Streaming this via Amazon is pretty good, although quality can vary based on your connection."
4,Entertaining,Thought this film was entertaining and helps round out the Avenger's characters. It was fun. My 10 year son enjoyed it also.
5,Great movie,"After seeing The Avengers, I really wanted to see the origins of Thor. This movie did not disappoint. My kids love it as well."
2,Meh,"Nothing was really exceptional in this movie. I'd write a long review, but I already feel like I've wasted enough of my life by watching it."
3,Tough one to rate,"It's mindless popcorn fun, but its good mindless popcorn fun. I liked it, but I didn't feel right giving it four stars - its really too lightweight for that. (its cousin, Iron Man, feels more substantial... more to do with RDJ than the difference in script quality)."
2,Good special effects,"Poor story, good special effects. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. No wonder it;s free. Hopefully your free stuff is better quality"
3,"Thor - Good movie, good actors",Anything with Anthony Hopkins in it makes me want to check it out. This movie was good. I liked the character developments and the overall character arcs - specifically how Thor takes up his mantel and how Loki decides upon his.
3,It was fun. We found the story so - so.,A bit trite ... although our teen grand sons probably didn't think so. Here are the required seven more words.
5,Nice,"I really liked this movie, it was another win for their heroes series. Good combination action, graphics, humor and a touch of romance. Well done!"
4,The God of thunder rocks!,"When they announced this film was coming I could not imagine how they would turn on door's God into a workable, cool character that people would identify with! i was very happily surprised at how well this script allows him to be both the far end, yet familiar with various aspects of the human condition. Lots of great action, And a beautiful romantic story as well. Everyone should enjoy this movie."
4,GO THOR .......,"The worst part was waiting for the blue ray to be released so I could watch it when ever I wanted. The casting was wonderful and it was like the characters jumped from the two dimentional comic to the big screen. Not only was the movie well scripted and cast, it also served as a life lesson of how one lives their life and how they can change for the better. This was a fine message for all ages."
4,Enjoyable diversion,"This movie was enjoyable and even though there are those detractors out there, I had fun with it. If you haven't seen it, just remember that this is a norse god that was brought into a comic book universe and now is being translated to screen. I thought they did a good job with it, given the subject matter. Being a fan of the Avengers, I was really worried when I heard that they were going to do a Thor centered movie. There are just too many ways for it to go terribly wrong.In the end, it was a fun diversion and I don't think that anything was horribly flubbed. Not the best movie of the summer, or even the best super hero movie of the summer - fun nonetheless."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"If you want a light-hearted superhero movie, this is great. It's a silly movie that knows it's silly. The characters even tell you so a couple times. Still, sometimes the costumes were a bit too much for me. The soundtrack is awesome, another reason to buy this.* spoiler alert * I really like the ""villain."" I didn't think he was a villain at all after he explained his highly interesting plot. He basically saved his homeland and should have been regarded as a hero, too. I wish the other characters appreciated him more and that he could have had a happy ending, but of course not, which is why this does not get 5 stars from me."
4,More than I expected,"even thought it's nothing like the comics, I still enjoy the movie the story line was good and the graphic was decent overall worth watching."
4,Its a Thor movie,"Thor... I didn't think it would work at all as a movie but, bamm. I loved it. If you like any of the Marvel movies, you might wanna check it out."
5,Thor 3D,"The movie is pretty good, but the 3d is awesome! The details are already in reviews, so I'll leave at that."
5,One of the better comic book superhero movies.,MIGHTY THOR - MIGHTY MOVIE.Didn't expect much from this but damn was i surprised. I had never read the comic so didn't know of the story of Thor other than he had a big hammer and was the god of thunder.Great special effects and cgi. PQ was excellent 4.5/5 - Couple of instances where the shots looked out of focus / blurry.AQ was outstanding 5/5. Blew me away. True 7.1 is so good and those surrounds are put to good use and often. Reference quality would be the term best to describe it.
2,"Great movie, terrible blu ray (am I the only one bothered by the blue line?)","I've searched through the reviews and I can't understand how nobody else is commenting on the fact that a blue line scrolls up the screen at just after the 49 minute mark when we first see Loki as king. I've gone through 5 different copies of this blu ray combo pack, from two different vendors, and all of them have the same issue at exactly the same spot. I've tried both the blu ray and the DVD and I've tried playing both on different blu ray players and with different TVs and that annoying blue line is there in every scenario. I'm really hoping that this issue will be fixed because I think the movie is excellent and I can't wait to own an copy that isn't flawed."
3,Hemsworth saves this mediocre superhero flick,"While it's not a Marvel property I find particularly interesting, it made for a decent summer flick. The real story here is the emergence of Chris Hemsworth, who has joined the ranks of the stars who can carry a big summer blockbuster, a fairly exclusive club."
5,Great movie Great deal,We saw this movie in the theatre still wanted to watch it over and again. Good blu-ray presentation and the digital copy is great to have for travel.
4,Just about as expected!,Received the item as described. Packaging kept it nice and safe except one corner was slightly bent on the cardboard outter box. Other than that it was great.
4,Better with Avengers,When I first saw this movie I thought it was kind of silly. OK but didn't enthrall me. Funny thing after I watched the Avengers I went back and watched this movie and liked it more. If nothing else this guy has a chest that goes on for days.
4,unexpected,"I actually was not interested to see this movie and tagged along --- then ended up being the one who liked it most. I am not a Natalie fan (I think she overacts/can't act) and am not a Thor comic book fan (chee-zee) but I like comic book heroes, sf/fantasy, mythology, and shakespeare and this story delivered all of that. Tom as a sneaky and clever Loki driven by feelings of inadequacy (I am not a psychologist but there's my take) got my attention and my sympathy and stole the show but Chris was a good counterpoint as a sort of simple-minded, golden-boy who has to grow up and deal with troubles he has never had to face in all his charmed life. The characters and plot had depth thanks to Kenneth as director --- had no idea he could take Shakespeare off-planet."
2,These are historians?,"I bought this based on the reviews and the general subject matter. It is supposed to be based on previously unknown information, etc. A book that says it is a history and does not darken one page with a foot note that specifies where they got the information to make that statement is not a history. It is a gossip column.For a man who was ""married to Germany"" he sure did get around and apparently, for reasons not clear, a lot of people knew about it. That little whispers of his activities did not get around is even more interesting. An explanation of how he kept his social activities so quiet would be appropriate for a book like this."
3,Very creative... but mixed results,"I'm torn about this album, because on one hand, I love the songs. On the other, I do not love the stories-- and they totally interrupt the flow of the album for me.The songs are funny and silly and very kid-friendly. However, then you get to the MORE THAN 7 MINUTE version of the ""Gecooch"" story, which I never want to hear again (once was plenty)... so I have to go over to the CD player and hit the ""skip"" button, and then again when it gets to ""Corroded Margaret"" (a hit-you-over-the-head-with-its-moral kind of story) and again when ""The Secret Room"" begins.When I'm playing with my daughter, I don't want to waste that kind of effort. It seems to me that most people would agree that you can listen to a song over and over a lot more than you'd want to listen to the same story over and over. I wish Lou would separate out his stories from his songs on separate CDs for those of us who like one or the other."
4,Lost Triumph,Clear new insight on this nation saving battle. I especially enjoyed the background reasoning of General Lee.Strong buyRay
1,Don't bother,"This book begins with a 'background' of the slavery issue as the cause of the war. Any historian worth his or her salt knows that slavery was not 'the' issue that lead to secession of the Confederate States. It's a shame they still teach that in high school, but an author writing a book about Lee should know better. It amazes me that the history books omit or diminish the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union states and that some Union states did not outlaw slavery until AFTER the war.Who can trust the theories proposed by the author if he doesn't have sufficient grasp of the underlying issues?"
1,"Weak, really weak","This book is mostly supposition, theory, guesswork, not a little fantasy, and a lot of the author putting a spin on events that support his (very implausible) thesis and ignoring or misinterpreting those that do not. He clearly understands Napoleonic theory, but if he actually read the after-action reports of JEB Stuart, R. E. Lee and others, it surely isn't evident. There's simply no evidence provided to support his theories - which probably seem plausible to those who don't have much knowledge of the subject matter, or who have read a couple books on Gettysburg and think they know something. Just where Carhart is really coming from is a bit strange: on the surface he has more than enough credentials to write a solid history, but this particular work-product suggests otherwise - in fact it is just awful, dreadful, and a travesty.But for all that, you might want to keep a copy on your shelf - the bathroom shelf that is; you never know when you'll run out of Charmin."
5,"Great Story, Great Book","Lost Triumph is first rate. A graduate of West Point, a PhD in History from Princeton, a combat veteran, Carhart brings intellectual sophistication and practical military understanding to his analysis of Lee's strategy at Gettysburg. There is no understanding Gettysburg without understanding Lee. Carhart does.A reb in the land of frost."
1,A Real Loss,"This is a total disappointment after reading Troy Harman's excellent book on the same subject. I had hopes of finding either support for his ideas or an interesting counter to them. Instead, I bought mishmash of half-developed ideas, silliness and writing that has nothing to do with Lee, Gettysburg or the Civil War. Price is a good indication of a book's ""legs"" and this one has none. Most Civil War people do not think much of this book and rate it badly."
1,Worst book on Gettysburg yet,"Every once in a while, a new book appears on a Gettysburg-related topic that makes it evident that the author knows next to nothing about the subject. A few really bad ones have appeared recently - one being Paul Walker's stinker of a book about the fight at East Cavalry Field on July 3. As if that weren't enough, here now is Carhart's contribution to the scrap heap of lousy, factually incorrect and poorly written pieces of tripe about Gettysburg. Every time I've written a detailed, negative review of this book here on Amazon, the powers that be have chosen to remove it. Instead of giving yet another litany of why this book is a waste of the paper its printed on, let me refer you to this review of this book on Civil War News: http://www.civilwarnews.com/reviews/bookreviews.cfm?ID=810. It says all that needs to be said. Instead of buying this book, buy a rubber chicken - you will have something of much more value in your hands."
4,Good Mix of History and Action,"When I first got this book, I thought it would be a lot of factual information. There is a lot of detail like that, but there is also real action to the book. It mixes history and good storytelling. However, there are some dull points in the book. The flow seems to be interrupted when Carhart talks about victories by Alexander, Napoleon, and Hannibal. This is where the book gets a little dull and hard to read. There are pictures to go along with the detail of battle, but they still can be confusing.If you are a pretty big history buff, I would really suggest this book. It explains in very good detail the life of Robert E. Lee along with his successes and failures. It does a very good job of telling why the Battle of Gettysburg turned out how it did, as well as depicting many other battles. Even if you're not too big on history, you might still find this book enjoyable just becuase of the anecdotal instances mixed in witht he book."
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would","This book should be listed under fiction, because that's what it is. Based on misinterpretations of and cherry-picking of some of the evidence, and intellectually dishonest because it just makes things up, this book doesn't deserve any stars. If I could give no stars, I would.Save your money. Buy yourself a happy meal. It's a better use of your money and ultimately more satisfying."
3,great product...but only one,"I was under the impression that there were two mats enclosed....both the ""2x"" and use of the word ""mats"" instead of ""mat"" confused me.We love the product, but probably wouldn't have gotten one so expensive if we had known we were buying only one mat instead of two.I've written the seller asking him to change the title - and make it clear in the description that only one mat is being sold. I hope he makes those changes...if not, hopefully all buyers will read these comments!"
2,Disappointing CD,I love Kenny Burrell but this is a lack luster cd. There is only one track that I really enjoyed. This is a great cd if you need to fall asleep. Kenny also sings on this cd. This is the only Concord Jazz Heritage Series cd I bought that was not all that good. The Herb Ellis and Barney Kessel ones are fantastic.
1,"It's William Clarke Quantrell, NOT Charles W.","For heaven's sake, the man's name was William Clarke Quantrell. Why buy or bother to read a book who's author doesn't even know the true name of the main character?"
4,Quantrills followers,A rare look into the lives of quantrills followers. Some information I have not read in other books. A different side from one of Quantrills own.
3,LMI Renaissance Recorder,"This recorder is not a true wide bore renaissance recorder, but does have the lower register strength and tone of the older recorders. This recorder travels in my rucksac for a good tute anywhere I go. An excellent buy for a second instument."
3,Plays ok for a plastic recorder...,Just beyond the level of a childs recorder. Has a rather harshly sharp tone (not that its out of tune sharp) from the whole piece being plastic. Just depends on what your doing with it.
4,good workout,"I am an aerobics instructor, so I need a workout that makes me work hard. This is a good one! Hve weights handy for this video though."
2,Not your typical SHAPE success,"I love SHAPE's fitness DVDs & have owned their Bikini Body Boot Camp series for years & still love them! I bought this hoping for an update to add to my routine & was quite diappointed when I received this one.The workout is just okay - it felt really long due to lack of upbeat music, dark setting, & boring moves. The instructor really ruined it for me - not your lovable power team from before (Tracy York, Michelle Dozois, & Lisa Wheeler). The instructor is a pretty cold, militant woman with a body that looks like she should be training in the army, rather than a SHAPE bikini workout. I found her unmotivating & just wanted to turn it off so I didn't have to listen to her anymore. I tried to warm up to this DVD by giving it a few trys, but I really don't like it at all.I would recommend avoiding this one & sticking to the classic Bikini Body Boot Camp series which is truly the best value for your money!"
1,Good workout but not my favourite dvd,Good workout but the instructor should have done some acting classes before she shot this dvd her cueing is quite hilarious. It's hard to do this video more than once or twice max. But it is a good workout so if you can afford it then why not!
2,ugh,"It just never worked out for me. The instructor wasnt so energetic and the quick workout nearly hurt my knee.Ill just say I prefer other dvds. I gave this Dvd to my mum, she likes it so to each's own."
4,Fun Workout,"This workout was really fun and really got my heart pumping. I enjoy how there are 3 levels of training in the video, which enables me to tailor it completely to what I can do."
2,"Decent workout, bad instruction","I usually love the DVDs from Shape, but I was really disappointed with this one. The workouts - both the cardio segments and toning segments - are fairly effective for an intermediate exerciser (although not great), but I found it very difficult to stay motivated to get all the way through the segments because of the instructor. She doesn't cue well or work both sides of the body evenly, and unfortunately her words of encouragement got on my nerves rather than got me to work harder. She also says those words of encouragement at weird times when I don't really need it and when she could be talking about something more helpful like form and technique. This is the first time I've ever found a Shape product to be less than satisfactory, but I thought that this DVD was not up to the standards of the others, and the annoying instruction overrode any of the benefits of the workouts themselves."
1,Deceptive picture...,"I was surprised (but not in a good way) when I received these 3 bowls. They're okay to look at and arrived undamaged but they are VERY small. The largest one is the size of a soup bowl - the other 2, even tinier. I was also not happy to learn they are made of enamel-coated steel and post a Proposition 65 Warning in California. I'm not used to this from Amazon - I should have read the description more closely."
2,So so,"I could have get the different design. The picture look better than it is.The one that I got made in Thailand. The white has the purple shade and not off white as in the photo.I hope correlle hold up to its name. Well, at least it made in Thailand instead of china."
2,"Corelle Bowl Set, Bamboo Leaf","I never knew Corelle Bowl Set was made of steel not with glass, other wise I woud never bought them."
2,Be wary of excellent review ratings,I loved the film and expected the book to be much better. Instead you will find that this is a story of a great guy written very badly. Unfortunately the other readers are correct in complaining about the writing style. It makes for an irritating gruelling read. Some sentences go on forever. There is a lack of reference to material and humour which makes the content somewhat dull.For ardent fans only this one.
2,Are We Being Conned?,"I really looked forward to this book, but after about six chapters, I got tired of it and had to return it. Trying to explain what is going on in Kaufman's mind is not a task easily taken, but there are no footnotes, bibliography or even an index. There is no mention of where any of the quotes attributed to Andy are from. Because of that I couldn't trust it. Sure Zmuda's book was as much about himself as it was about Andy, but at least you had the knowledge he knew what he was talking about, and it was a heckuva lot easier to read. I felt this book was more about the author showing off than about a good bio of Andy."
1,Awful writing style,"I read some pages of this book and couldn't continue. The author's writing style is so strange and disgusting. How can anyone stand this? I love Andy Kaufman, but I can't read this book. At least some of 5-star reviews here must be fake."
5,A journey into the mind of Andy Kaufman,"Lost in the Funhouse is one of the most interesting biographies that I have ever read. The subtitle could not be more correct. Sure, the writing style is unorthodox, but since when was anything related to Andy Kaufman orthodox? This book takes you into the workings of a mind that was both complex and bizarre and the stylistic freedoms that Bill Zehme takes only help the reader understand the schizophrenic extremes that Kaufman's mind would go to. Andy's life is one that has left people guessing about the details. Mr. Zehme's book begins to help the reader find some answers. Maybe. His extensive research shows throughout while not becoming too overbearing. Do I now know who Andy Kaufman was because of reading this book? No. Do I better understand why he did what he did and what drove him to do them? Yes. That's all that we can realistically ask from a book about one who played with reality as if it were silly putty."
1,Sorry not good,The writer attempts to be Kaufmanesque thoughout the story and it suffers for it. I'll bet you can't get through it! He's a gifted author but this one isn't one of his best.
1,Good try but reads too pretentiously,"I was quite excited to buy and read this book; I think Andy Kaufman is one of the comic geniuses of our time and there has always been so much unexplained about him. The author obviously shares that affection, and not just because he spent 6 years on the book. But the first half is really boring and is filled with unverifiable ""facts,"" and by the end I felt like I knew 10 times more about Bill Zehme than Andy Kaufman. It felt like he'd put Andy on a slide under a microscope, and when what he saw was still fuzzy, decided to fill up his book with a novel about him and Andy Kaufman. Though I'm sure he didn't mean to, the effect rang really pretentious, like he was either trying to pull a fast on the reader because he didn't have enough material, or that he thought he was Norman Mailer. I wish he was too--or at least a reporter who would say like on ""Dragnet,"" ""just the facts,ma'am."""
1,... on paper,"This book seems like it was written from newspaper clippings.It is a terrible biography. After I finished I felt so cheated I had to destroy the book. I ripped it to shreds!!! It felt good!Read Bob Zamuda's book, it is superior."
5,Amazing,This book amazed me. It went through andys mind describing every little detail about him and what his perspective on life was. He was a very talented man but yet miss understanded. Read this book if u didnt like andy kaufman before then u will like him after reading this book. This a must buy order it or go to local bookstore now!
2,"Put a fork in Andy, he's done.","After reading the first bio (Zmuda's) and now this one, I was hoping Lost in the Funhouse would be the more focused and complete of the two works. Not so. The writing here is just as annoying as the Zmuda's book is self-centered. I came to the conclusion that maybe there isn't enough story here to fill two books. After Carrey's film, this should just about satisfy any curiousity I had about Andy's work. By then Andy's legacy will have been picked clean by those who claim to be honoring him."
1,I Hope This Isn't Really the Andy I've Come to Know,Took me over a month to finish reading this book. It was almost a chore. I don't know Andy personally but have been a fan from the first sighting on SNL's inaugural show through every quirky act I could catch on tv and lately catching up what I missed back then after finding it on youtube. I don't think Andy showed anybody who he really was including his own family. This book makes him look so childish and naive as to appear almost stupid. From what I do know about him his act was sheer genius. This isn't the Andy I've come to know. My puppy seems to be a critic and chewed a good part of the front cover. I shoulda bought Zmuda's book.
4,The reissues are better,"""Stormy Weather"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" are remastered reissues of ""Live at the Jazzhaus"" Vols. 1 & 2 (1965). Along with ""The Jeep is Jumping"" (also 1965) they constitute Webster""s best later work after having moved to Europe. The reissues have a much better sound than the ""...Jazzhaus"" volumes. The program includes many of the standard ballads associated with Webster. There is never a dull performance. Webster, like Ellington, just kept getting better with age. Webster plays with one of the leading bands in Europe at the time, the Alex Riel Trio comprised of Kenny Drew on piano, Alex Riel on drums and the amazing Nils Henning Orsted Penderson on bass."
5,Among Ben's finest,"The recordings quality on the original Black Lion recordings is astounding for the time. Many of Dexter Gordon's albums on Steeplechse recorded decades later do not sound as good as these. These were originally on Black Lion both on lp and on disc. On lp, all this music was on three lp's. Volume three was hard to get. I got it in England when i was a student there. The first two volumes were readily available here at budget prices.Then these discs were reissued. I have the reissues too. The sound was remastered and is fabulous. Get this set. Ben is playing with a modern bebop rhythm section that is really on. I would listen to this music on headphones and there is a moment when it sounds like the bartender was throwing a glass liquor bottle in the trash. It sounded so real and like I was there that I literally ducked to avoid being hit. How real is that?!Get it while you can and it is not an mp3."
5,So cute and functional!,These fit my baby great- and she's a long baby. They keep her legs warm and help protect her legs now that she has started crawling. They are cute and come in a lot of different colors.
5,Beautifully written story of a family joined by roses.,"This book is a touching history of generations of families who adore roses and creating new roses. It is well-written by Antonia Ridge, an author who created a very vivid scene of life in France and how it changed over the years. She explains the skill of creating roses very well. The families in the book are lovable and unforgettable. I also suggest Ridge's ""Family Album""."
5,For Love of a Rose,A lovely old fashioned story of a rose growing family through the generations. Quaint and absorbing.
2,"Great book, HORRIBLE markers!","I have had several of priddy's wipe clean books and LOVED THEM! I was expecting the same from this but the first book we tried was completely destroyed by the markers that came with it. They stained it and no matter what I tried it would not wipe off! I went and bought some expo dry erase markers and they do wipe off the book like they are suppose to! So if you plan on using this book, try the markers in a non noticable spot to test it first (so that way your whole book doesn't get runined). And if it does stain it, you can go buy some expo dry erase markers and problem solved! Book is great with many fun, educational activities! Both my 2 and 4 year olds love these books!"
5,1972 - 2004,"I enjoyed this humorous book-- very witty and clever. It's a pre-Sex and the City, pre-Bridget Jones pre-Chick Lit classic."
2,a big let down,"i was very excited about reading this book, but it was really a let down. The main character, is a [prostitute], she fumbles thru her life, and learns not a thing from her own mistakes. That and the book seems a bit dated for me. Save your coins.... this one is a doozie..."
2,OK PRODUCT,"Typcial language product that was obviously not produced or even checked by native speakers. MANY language translation errors - as explained to me by native speakers who listened to the materilas...and laughed at the translation. ""No one speaks THAT way"" or ""Words are right...meaning is wrong"".There are better products on the market. Skip this, if you want to really speak correctly and be properly understood."
1,Shipping Charges are OUTRAGEOUS,"The seller charges $1.35 per silver dime. Which is OK. The problem is that he charges $4.94 a coin for shipping. If someone was to buy 10 coins the coins would cost you $13.50 cents, but the shipping charges would cost you $49.40 for shipping 10 dimes. This cost is unacceptable for something that may weigh less than an ounce."
4,A must for your Cheers collection,"Received Cheers Season 10 from Amazon in good condition. There were no damages. The DVD set is slim and does not occupy much space, but the down side is that its just a plain box - the earlier season sets were bulky but they had photos of some episodes from the season that one could have a look at when unfolding the box.Season 10 was an enjoyable season with two memorable episodes Woodys wedding and the bar wars episode. Woodys wedding episode is so hilarious, things keep on getting worse and yet the Cheers gang pulls it off - probably one of the best episodes of the entire Cheers franchise. Season 10 was not among the best seasons but hey its CHEERS!! none of the episodes are a drag and they always put a smile back on the viewer.The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because the dvd set contains NO EXTRAS - thats disappointingAll in all worth the price"
4,Will they cut corners?,"This is my all time favorite sitcom. Each week I have friends over to play pool and Cheers is always on. It's great that season 10 didn't take as long to be released as season 9. However, in season 9 there were some disappointments. (1) Some of the original music was replaced. (2) Some scenes were edited (3) The packaging was cheap. No color fold out with pictures, and the DVD's were plain. Paramount has done this before with other releases such as Happy Days. This was very disappointing, especially since we were given no advanced notice and no significant price break. Will Paramount cut corners again? I hope not. We'll have to wait until Sep 2nd to find out."
3,Not The COMPLETE Tenth Season?,Did anyone else notice this is being advertised and sold as Cheers: The Tenth Season rather than Cheers: The Complete Tenth Season? Season 9 says The Complete Ninth season and yet we all know that's not true as scenes were edited and music changed. It even said so itself on the back of the box. So this time they list it as only The Tenth season which makes we wonder how much they butchered this season.
4,Keep em Coming,Cheers is a classic. Season 10 was another great one for Cheers. We have the hilarious wedding at the end for Woody. We have the Bar Wars episodes of which are always good. This is great seasaon and I look forward to the final season 11 to complete my collection.
4,Cheers 10,"Great to finally get Cheers 10 after such a long wait - frustating that dates for releases are not easily or readily available - Cheers 11, The Sheild 7 etc., and also would be better if there was some 'special features' - interviews or contributions from those involved as on previous early season releases - hope they do it for the last one - Cheers !!"""
1,DVDs Quality Poor,"I just received my 10th season and all 4 discs were all badly scratched. CBS/Paramount's quality of their DVDs is the worse of all studios. I think because they have so many rights to TV shows and are putting them out at a fast pace, regardless of the quality of the DVDs. CBS/Paramount needs to get their act together and start putting out quality unscratched DVDs."
1,reloading,I loved the series but the problem with it was it would keep reloading and would take a long time to do so.It seems to be a problem with amazons streaming. I have no problem with other sights streaming.
4,My Review,"I got fthis gift or my dad's birthday (arrived on Mon. 2/5). It was a few days late, but I didn't want to pay $8.00 for 2 day shipping. I just put a picture in a box & wrapped it instead. He seems to be enjoying it so far. Thank you:)"
5,Classic Season!!,"So many classic episodes in the 10th Season, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 666"", ""The Norm Who Came to Dinner"", and maybe the funniest episodes of Cheers, definitely among the funniest, the classic two parter where Woordy gets married ""An Old-Fashioned Wedding"" among 15 others. Cheers is the greatest show of all time, and the fact it maintained the highest quality througout an 11 year run is amazing. Some shows start to dwindle after 4 or 5 Years, and Cheers was always great. From Yeat One, right up through it's all time classic final episode. My only complaint with the Cheers dvd's is the lack of extras, and the editing of songs out of episodes. But, the episodes themselves are top notch, and hilarious as always. Two Thumbs way up from me!"
4,cheers to CHEERS,I have loved CHEERS ever since it premiered on TV and now I can watch it anytime i want to. Season 10 has some of the funniest show of all time and makes me laugh everytime I watch the shows.
2,NO Exercises At All - Only Theory,"I picked up this book thinking it would include all kinds of useful, experimental exercises in order to develop my auric sight through practice.Wrong. It never included any exercises. Not one.The book carried on page after page about how beautiful the colors are and how wonderful it is, but lacked any practicality!This goes for all of Panchadasi's other books, including ""Clairvoyance"" and ""The Astral World"".This author is all theory, and no strategy. I found it humorous how he could write an entire book on the subject claiming he is going to teach us all kinds of stuff, and NEVER DOES.p.s. I have absolutely no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. This book gave NO useful applicable information. Only descriptions of the phenomenon assuming you already know how to see it.p.p.s. If you know a book that actually teaches how to develop auric sight through hard solid work, please send me a link."
1,Book incomplete,"Don't buy this copy the table of contants is missing, there are about 3 other copies of this book that is complete look at the sample first i am returning it"
3,"Gunslingers, from TV's 50's","Stories of the Century was a western series back in the mid-fifties which starred Jim Davis(patriarch of the TV series Dallas)and Mary Castle. The two were a pair of detectives that were ficticiously thrown into the lives and history of gunfighters of the old west i.e. Jesse James, Billy the Kid, The Younger Brothers Joaquin Murietta (remember the more recent Mask of Zorro? Antonio's brother was Joaquin.)etc. All filmed in black and white, it gives the viewer some old-time authentic western history of some characters of an era long ago. If you're into old TV westerns of the 50's, you need to own this entertaining piece of nostalgia."
2,Boring,I was really looking forward to this book but was greatly disappointed. It was boring with little action. The romantic scenes just never flamed.
4,Very Well Written but short a bit on romance,"Bonner and Ginny were strong, intelligent characters in the book. But at times, it felt like you were reading a history book, well written and exciting at times. It didn't feel like you were reading a romance novel though. Very little connection, affection between the strong characters. You can relate well with the story line and all the major players. I wanted more. I wanted to feel the feelings developed between Bonner and Ginny. I wanted to read that justice was done in the story, but it wasn't. I wanted to know if Ginny would be carrying their child. You'll never know. Just wasn't enough said/told about Bonner and Ginny. But I did enjoy reading this book. You won't be disappointed.."
5,Nintendo Power,"From the beginning, Nintendo Power has focused heavily on providing game strategy, tips and tricks, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. Seeing as the magazine enjoyed 20 years of Nintendo-directed publication, NP is the ultimate source for detailed mapping and insider knowledge delivered directly from the programming teams. As a result, the magazine has enjoyed the reputation of being the definitive source for all things Nintendo, separating itself from a more traditionally speculative approach as used by its contemporaries. The magazine is one of the longest-running game oriented magazines still in circulation."

5,horse,This is an amazing toy. I have two girls. The horse is pretty big. It's soft and beautiful. The picture is not as lovely as the real toy is. If you have webkinz fans than this makes the perfect gift. ***** 5 star material!!
4,"It's a mad, mad, mad book.","One of the greatest books on morality written, it takes a ""fresh"" view of the ten commandments."
5,A great book for anyone who wants to improve their schools.,"I read this book about two years ago, and since that time we have worked with the author and incorporated the author's ideas on discipline, which he calls ""ProActive Discipline"" in our high school. It has literally made our school into a new place.The change was so dramatic that parents and community people were coming onto campus, noticing the difference, and asking us what we had done to cause such a dramatic change.He has many ideas on various aspects of school reform, all of which are different than most of what is usually pushed as school reform. His ideas are all very practical and common sence (he has actually produced results with them both as a high school principal and as a consultant). If you have the courage and desire to really reform your schools, this is a great book."

1,The All-Time WORST movie ever produced!,"This movie has less than zero plot, and actors that drag it down even deeper. I saw it in the theater, and had I not gotten free tickets, I would have been furious. I almost walked out. But hey, I still had popcorn."
4,sorry for its expensiveness,"In Japan, CD is very expensive. So when I go on a shopping for CD, I always get the import one. This music is nice, and also the jacket is, but too expensive because of IMPORT from Japan. I'm sorry for it. I hope this album release in the US. But thisrecord company is now under the japanese Sony Music Co., so my hope would not realise."
5,One of Brubecks best efforts,I first came across this album in the mid 60's and haven't been able to find it for years. This is truly one of Brubecks best.
1,Blows,I've got every cd this band ever did and accidently came across BLS in the store. I'm a true hard core fan but this one I can do without. Maybe I'll use the cd for a coaster. That's about all it's good for. What a disappointment.
4,"black like sunday, 4.25 stars.","i have not been familiar with kings x for a long time. the first time i heard them was at a gig several months ago. they were opening for joe satriani and dream theater. of course, i was there for satch and DT.kings x wasnt the kind of band that grew on me at first. actually, i was indifferent about them at first. but their catch, beatles-esqe intelligent rock music soon lured me in for good. this band is a true original.guitarist ty tabor is so good he makes me want to puke, haha. not really. he is, however, one of my favorite modern guitarists. i had no idea upon initial listen that black like sunday was made up of very old songs. i personally do not thing these songs are dated, as some people have stated in reviews. on the contrary, i find them to be timeless, substantial, relevant works of modern art.as far as rock n roll goes, it just doesnt get much better than kings x."
2,An album for Nostalgia buffs only,"According to articles detailing the release of ""Black Like Sunday,"" King's X went through their library of unreleased songs, re-recorded them, and released them on this new album. Herein lies the primary fault of the album. While the sound is modern and the performances are excellent, the songs reveal a lack of compelling songwriting that has come to be expected of King's X. This, I assume, is due to the fact that the songs were written when the band was still in its infancy (both in terms of band status and songwriting acumen.) Anyhow, this cd would be appreciated most by those who are diehard fans and completists of King's X's work, and not by those who are fans of their later work. As a final note, perhaps the album should've been released as a lower priced ep, with a longer lp of new material being released concurrently."
4,A Good Album by a great band.,"I just saw King's X in concert a month or so ago and they played 2 tunes from the Black Like Sunday album: Finished and Johnny. I knew the album would be good just hearing those two songs live. Johnny is spectacular, far and away my favorite on the album with the great jam at the end 8 minutes long. Finished and Black Like Sunday are other great tunes as well. Definitely worth picking up. If you get a chance to see them live I highly recommend it."
3,"Old stuff, sounds new","King's X is one of the best bands in the world. This CD is a release of freshly recorded old material from the early eighties. It sounds great and is good for what it is. The songs are catchy, but some have some corny lyrics. The best songs are Finished(awesome tune), Two, Down, Johnny, and Dreams.Not the first CD a new fan should purchase, but good nonetheless. New fans should get Dogman or Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. Compared to all other rock out there it is a good CD. Compared to other King's X CDs it is fair, but a fun listen for what it is."
2,Black Like Disappointment,"I just finished listening to Black Like Sunday again after not having taken it off the CD shelf for several years and I'm sorry to say it hasn't gotten any better. I'm as big a Kings X fan as anyone but this album is a low point for them. I remember when this first came out and it was billed as old pre-Kings X songs redone. I got very excited because I assumed (sadly mistakenly so) that it would have a sound like the earliest Kings X albums. I realize now that those expectations were off the mark and rightly so I believe. I'll take my lumps in that regards. What really disappoints me most about this album is that it's the least Kings X ""sounding"" album in their entire catalogue. With Doug handling the lead vocal chores, If I didn't know any better, I'd almost think this was some kind of solo project, not Kings X. All in all, it's the one Kings X studio release that I may never listen to again."
2,Big dissapointment....,"For me this was a much anticipated album and after hearing the title track I was a little curious but also cognizant of the fact that initial singles usually don't represent the best of a release. Well, this one in fact does. I am a HUGE KX fan and usually will take some departure in sound in stride (Bulbous grew on me big time). However, it's quite obvious that this collage of memorabilia of the band's early days proves that they covered a lot of pop tunes in the early 80's. I would describe this essentially as a rehash of songs from that era with the blazing digital dexterity of Ty Tabor sprinkled throughout. To me that's the only saving grace, unfortunately. As much as I appreciate their roots I can't say that this is worth having. For dedicated fans only--maybe, even if only to note the quantum leap that transpired from the style of this era to that of their debut LP, Out of the Silent Planet."
3,"Not a ""New"" King's X Album","I just wish they had given it some revealing title, like ""Old Stuff from Before We Were King's X, the Best Rock Band Ever"" or something equally catchy to make it perfectly clear. I love this band above any other, but Black Like Sunday is a Sneak Preview record, and Sneak Preview is extinct."
4,SOLID AS ALWAYS,"YOU CAN COUNT ON A FEW THINGS IN THIS WORLD. ONE IS THAT PEBOZO AKA PEDROZA, DANIEL IS A MISGUIDED, TROUBLED INDIVIDUAL WHO SUFFERS FROM MID-LIFE CRISIS AND WANTS TO RE-LIVE THE GLORIOUS 70S. ANOTHER THING IS THAT KING'S X PUTS OUT SOLID MUSIC EACH TIME THEY RELEASE A NEW CD. THIS IS NO EXCEPTION. BLACK LIKE SUNDAY, SCREAMER, JOHNNY ARE HIGHLIGHTS. GREAT TO HERE SOME OF THEIR EARLY, HUNGRY, AGGRESSIVE TUNES."
3,Typical...,"...chances are you are a King's X fan if you are even reading this. So you know what to expect.However, I have to wonder why Ty isn't more involved vocally. I happen to think he's got a fantastic voice - and isn't featured enough. If you're a Ty fan - you may be disappointed as, if I recall correctly, he doesn't sing lead on one tune. After hearing Doug belt out tune after tune, I think tossing in Ty would be a nice change of pace and compliment to some of the songs.Still a good effort, though - and like someone else says ... I'd rather listen to an average King's X disc than any of the derivative [stuff] out today."
4,this album could be the bridge,"There are alot of feelings about BLS. I see it as a good thing that KX went back to these songs and did them. I think it is the album that will bridge their career to the future. sometimes you gotta go back to remember who you were to move ahead to the future. Back are some of the KX that we all loved, a more positive energetic sounding KX. KX for the last couple of albums has been pretty dark and droning, i love the records but you gotta admit. I just hope to god the next KX album is an uplifting barrage of kick*** harmonies, whaling gtr and of course dUg deep in it. Enough of the sludge and up with the power guys. blow our minds in that studio you got Ty, how about 40 tracks of background vocals to give it that BIG sound next time."
2,Misleading listing; not Ory and Oliver themselves,"The Amazon listing for this item is quite misleading. While these are tunes made famous by King Oliver and Kid Ory, the present versions are all performed by British ""trad jazz"" revivalists like Chris Barber and Rod Mason. It would be better to list this under ""various artists"" instead of under Ory and Oliver's names.That said, these recordings are pretty good and convey the spirit of the British ""trad"" movement. It's recommended if you like traditional jazz but aren't looking for the authentic 1920s recordings. However, some purists might be turned off by the obvious use of electric bass on some tracks."
5,Beautiful Symmetry,"Buffa is always good at characterization, and very good--even poetic--at description of place. He is also superb at moral ambiguity.Here he adds swiss-watch construction.As always, he does not just treat individual cases, but whole concepts-- global justice, retribution, the nature of relationships, media, the ability to know the truth.I saw the ending coming long before it came, but that did not lessen my appreciation for the beautiful symmetry of this book.Julian Sinclair expresses appreciation for ""The Count of Monte Christo,"" and that old-fashioned sense of balance pervades the book.Still, it is right up to date in its sharp critique of Trial by Media and rushing to judgment.Great work."
1,trial by dullness,"this is a mess structurally and in terms of characterization, a novel which has veered so far from the moral core of classic detective fiction that the hero, based apparently on prince valiant, has no hesitation in murdering a fellow prisoner (a child-molester, of course)to provide a burned body in place of his in an unlikely escape from san quentin. no mention of any concern by the prison authorities about the disappearance of the fellow prisoner...characters are cardboard, modelled on the likes of mr cheerible at his most irritating and gloria allred at her most waspish. the plot is old, threadbare and simply unbelievable. avoid it..too many lawyers are retiring early and writing dreadful novels..they should stick to their knitting.."
4,An excellent scourcebook.,"If you want to create a golem to scare the hell out of your players, this book is a must. It's well writen, with both the character view point and simple, easy (for a DM) to understand statisical information on what is required to create a truly compeling(SP?) golem character. Tons of interesting powers and weaknesses, including the dread hyper-regeneration, which makes golems even more frightening. If you plan to run a Frankenstein-like plot, this book is priceless!"
1,Download does not work!,"Beware! I purchased this digital book and the Amazon interface told me it was imediately available and I even got an email informing me it was in my ""Media Library"". But it never appeared. Not only that, but 2 out of 3 times I tried to access the ""Media Library"" I got a message that said it wasn't available and to come back in 15 minutes. This Amazon technology is definitely not ready for prime time!"
3,no five star review here...,"Good...but definitely not a five star record. Seems like every ""post"" Infernal Love record is called a return to form by critics, but that is b.s.This is actually one of my least favorite ""post"" Infernal Love records by Therapy? (next to the confused, yet occasionally interesting Semi-Detached) to be honest...still worthy of a listen, but i much prefer Suicide Pact: You First, Never Apologize Never Explain, and Crooked Timber. This one tends to be more on the catchy pop driven side, and i personally prefer the noisier (occasionally catchy) side of this band. I love Troublegum, but Nurse is my favorite record of theirs (if that helps to describe where I'm coming from).Needless to say though, all of Therapy?'s albums are worth investigating...."
4,"Scream, if you want to","Therapy? is a band that has had its ups and downs. They were very popular in the mid 1990's, with albums like Troublegum and Infernal Love, but also very underground in the late 1990's. With High Anxiety, Therapy? still prove that they are a force to be reckoned with. Unlike previous albums as Shameless and Suicide Pact You First, High Anxiety reminds me of their best album to date Troublegum. It is not a simple copy, because there are also influences from other albums they have released. High Anxiety is just an electrifying album with heavy guitars, noise attacks (no so many as on other albums) and excellent vocals. Vocalist Andy Cairs delivers his best vocal efforts so far. A negative observation is that the album, when comparing it to their entire back catalogue, does not contain any new elements. I highly recommend listening to this album when you feel like screaming along with songs."
1,Defective product,"I purchased this bulb because the original was becoming very dim due to old age. (7 years) Installed bulb and turned on. Bulb glowed at base for one second and went out, then totally dead. Reinstalled old bulb which worked fine. fortunately the company I purchased the new bulb from through Amazon gave me full credit and didn't want the old bulb returned. (Econotone, Inc., 1059 58th St., Brooklyn, NY 11219) Excellent service."
1,Defective product,"The contacts are slimmer than the original. Sometimes it took minutes to turn on.Sometimes I could turn it on by jiggling it.It no longer works and the bulb ends are darker, like it was very old.The shipping charges were $10!I do not want to waste more $ returning it when a replacement might be the same.If anyone at amazon reads this, please acknowledge and credit my money!!!"
5,All The Way From Shropshire - A Real Rock Gem,"When Mott The Hooples classic All The Young Dudes hit the shelf almost thirty years ago, I was one of the first in line to buy it - and the music of Ian Hunter has been one of the many constants in my life ever since.This is the hidden history of rock and roll, the essential essence, its timeless qualities and haunting reminders of disquieting beauty, vulnerability and inner strength. Ian Hunter is one of rocks true long distance runners, who has made rock and roll his life, carried out with true dedication, professionalism and honesty that is reflected in his rockers and ballads. Ian Hunter is the real working class rock hero that Lennon characterized so well, and Ian knows and lets us know what he thinks this thing called life is all about.Regards,Martyn R Jones"
3,....Standin' In My Light?,"Oh, boy: I don't know who Campbell Devine (OBTS's ""compiler"") is, but he ought to be kicked in the 'nads for his influence on what should have been an even greater ""Greatest Hits"" CD since Dr. John's ""Mos' Socious"" or any of the recent Procol Harum compilations. Come ON: a disco version of ""All American Alien Boy?"" (without Jaco's incredible bass solo!), the inclusion of ""Shallow Crystals"" in lieu of ""Overnight Angels,"" or the EXclusion of ""That Girl Is Rock And Roll?"" And WHY would ANYBODY covet a version of ""Dudes"" by (BLGH) Def Leppard? It is nice, though, the inclusion of the three movie soundtrack songs. Still: for completionists only."
1,Beware: This is not what you expect,"I bought this 2-cd set for one song: ""All of the Good Ones Are Taken"". It wasn't the version that experienced alot of air-play in the 80's...it's like an unplugged (boring!) remake. I'm extremely disappointed. I think there are other re-makes on this ""best of"" as well."
1,"Ian Hunter - once bitten , twice shy","I don't know whos came first but this one has nothing on the Great white version back in the 80's.. ""Ian WHO?"" , should 've saved the money for the studio and bought some bud's.."
2,"Not much here, even for a slow reader","I heard about this book on the radio and was very excited, since I love cooking and hate fast food. This book is overpriced and overproduced. The information about ""slow food"" is interesting, but could have been a long magazine article--just doesn't warrant oversized full-color treatment. There are very few recipes. I recommend the recent regional Italian cookbook, Rustico, by Mikol Negrin, a real treasure trove of slow recipes."
1,frank bruno,"this book is a waste. the few simple recipes can be found in any monthly food magizine for alot less money. at best they are not even correct. example pg, 128 has you soaking dried cod for 1 hour. I can make many italian jokes about the procedure in the book. but cod, normally is soaked three days. unless you like a mouth full of pure salt with cardboard. of the more then 300 books I own this is the worst."
4,Great oil aroma!,"I have been purchasing this essential oil for years as I use it to make my all my own envirnomently friendy cleaning supplies. I have not purchased a household cleaning product for 25 years as I make my own & add this oil for a refreshing scent. However, the price has trippled 3x's since last year. Why? It isn't made out of oil which is why all products in a plastic container, like laundry detergent, trash bags, etc. have trippled in price... Oil rules the world & has driven up most prices made with plastic.J.L.F."
4,"Brand New Heavies, The - Sometimes","SOMETIMES sees the Brand New Heavies trying out Siedah Garrett in N'Dea Davenport's place, and for the most part, she works out admirably, added a more mature tone to the singing, even if it's not as strong. But the Masters at Work's ""MAW Smooth Mix"" is the one to go for. As promised, it's smooth, but also has a fast, funky bassline that really gets the track going. Their ""Nuyoricans Meet the Heavies"" mix go for jazzier breaks. You can pretty much skip over Ummah's mix, which is great until the rap comes in to ruin it. Well, sometimes you can't have everything..."
2,Too many things in just a short book,"The proverbs are great, the riddles are fine, but there are many quotations, excerpts, and even holidays! I would have preferred the author would have limited to one proverb per day! That way the book would have been wonderful!"
2,"Buy this only if you've been on ""So You Think You Can Dance"" or are very patient!","The other reviews pretty well summed it up: a great workout if you can get it. I've now watched it 3 times, and I spend most of the time just jumping around with my own moves because I give up after several tries. Today I had more time and did lots of rewinding to try to get the moves right, so I could get the benefits, which seem like they'll be great eventually. That camera work is sooooo frustrating---focusing on the other dancers' hips when she's just introduced a new foot routine, which you then can't see. If you're looking for an instantly beneficial workout, this isn't it. If you're patient and want a great dance workout, this is it. A few tips: works better if you're NOT doing it on carpet, and, some of the routines seem to be on a four-beat count, and some on a three-beat, but that's just my non-dancer's best guess! Good luck!"
4,another great edition from the Hawthorne series,"This is definitely more for pro-gay therapists than their gay male clients. It's a lifespan text, ranging from childhood memories to the aging process. One of the last sections is on gay men and aging. This ads to the growing and needed literature on older gay men. This book is full of exercises and thus might not go as in depth as readers who want to delve deeply into various topics. Key issues covered here are drug recovery, AIDS, depression, etc. The author works out of New Mexico, rather than San Francisco, so I think he's probably had to work with gay men that have had to face much homophobia outside of many coastal, liberal environments."
2,Hard to Listen,"Based on other reviews here and comparisons to Jellyfish, Jason Falkner and the Beatles, I was expecting a lot better. Instead I find this work very shrill and hard to listen to. Is the guy talented musically? Yes. But his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me. Sorry but I feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here. I am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre."
3,One Big Highlight,"""Could Be Worse"" is the standout track; the rest is OK but undistinguished. I'm writing the review mainly so I stop getting this CD recommended every time I buy another power pop album."
5,Bleu=Nearly Perfect Power Pop,"This record is just catchy-as-hell, the perfect combination of pop and rock, with plently of fuzzed-out guitars and gorgeous melodies. The guitar riffs are on the heavy side, but are balanced out by great vocals and harmonies. This record is just infectious. I think really anyone would like this, but it's especially a must for anyone who likes Fountains of Wayne, Semisonic, Nada Surf, or any other bands of their ilk. This record also takes the risk of adding the occaisional hair-metal harmonized lead guitar part (as they do on ""Could Be Worse""), but it totally works. Really, just buy this record, this guy's got a great voice and superior songwriting skills and the result basically just rules."
1,Terrible results,"Used this trimmer today. Feels cheap and the springs fell out when I opened it. Against my better judgement, I gave it a try. It really tore up the wood and did not trim very well. Thought I was doing something wrong and tried it again on a piece of scrap. Still could not get a consistent result. Piece of garbage."
1,Too small and not valuable,"We bought a similar book ""Step into reading"" for Thomas and Trains in Costco. It had 6 full stories with each story around 20 pages at least with lots of text to read through. We thought this book is similar to that. But all we found was that it is just 15 to 20 page book with no stories but just opposite words, no more than 3 words per page. Very little to read for my son. Total waste of money."
4,Great for age 2-ish!,"My 2 year old loves Buzz and Woody (who doesn't?) and this is one of those books he can memorize and ""read"" on his own. If your child is at that stage and likes the characters, its good at that.I got the book for an airplane activity - it kept him busy all week long, but has lost some of its appeal now that he has his full library to select from."
3,Fast Eddie Clarke - 'It Ain't Over Till It's Over' (Griffin),"Here's a CD release that I never thought would end up seeing the light of day.As most of you probably do know that Fast Eddie Clarke was guitarist for Motorhead from 1976-82 until him and Lemmy had an apparent falling out. He then formed Fastway in which their first three lp's were great '80's metal. Getting back to 'It Ain't Over...', I personally thought Clarke handled both the vocal chores as well as the guitar playing rather well. This is a heavy rock CD, with some bluesy influence thrown in. Tunes that totally rock out were ""No Satisfaction"", ""Snakebite"", ""Laughing At The Devil"" (which features Lemmy on lead vocals-alright!) and ""In The City"". Not a bad piece of semi-historic music here."
1,What in God's name are you doing Mr. Clarke?,"Fast Eddie Clarke may be regarded as a legend among Motörhead fans, and even the first two albums with Fastway was good. But this album is just not worthy! I don't know what happened but nothing works. The material is very weak and forgettable. I strongly advise you to skip this one!"
2,Great cheap way to lift your motor,"This product would be great if it was what it is advertised as. This gives you 4"" setback and only 4"" of rise instead of 5.5"" of rise like it says."
4,A Look at '50s British Youth Subculture,"While Beat Girl can easily be ""read"" as an ""youth-ploitation"" film in the Chalkboard Jungle mold, it is better than most from the era in how it delves into some of the undercurrents in British youth subculture of the time. Rumor has it that a new British edition will be coming out soon -- hopefully, it will contain the footage that is missing from this edition, and will come from a cleaner print (with fewer awkward splices). Adam Faith may have had virtually all his hit singles sugar coated with orchestral strings--thereby making them more middle-of-the-road pop than rock--but in ""Made You,"" which he sings in this film, proved that he could also rock out. Gillian Hills shows the fire that would make her a star, and John Barry's theme music--which is heard a tad too often throughout the movie--puts rock and roll into jazz in a way that few composers were doing in 1960."
4,BEAT GIRL BAD GIRL IS GOOD GIRL.,"Tremendous fun. Tries to say that the Kids growing up in England after WWII all went off the rails but oh my how innocent it all was and it all works out that Mummy and Daddy know best!!!!!!!!! Noelle Adam plays a Frenchwoman who may have had a shady past before she marries the Rich Daddy of :BEAT GIRL: JENNIFER{A dead ringer for the 1950,s version of Brigitte Bardot} Jennifer hangs in the Beat clubs with her friends played by many of Englands VERY young and up and coming young stars. Sally Ann Field, Oliver Reed and Peter Mc Enery, Best known in the US for giving Haley Mills her first screen kiss in Disneys ""THE MOONSPINNERS. Was Daddys new wife a stripper?And can I be one too. And just what does the Owner of the strip club { CHRISTOPHER LEE} have on his mind? He obviously likes biting necks even without fangs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,This is for every JOHN BARRY LOVER,"WOW! I saw this picture about 40 years ago. The story is not worth to be written about, but watch for the music. The first John Barry film score, with UK pop singer Adam Faith and Shirley Anne Field.The music is great with much nostalgy.Buy this and close your eyes!"
4,Amazing photography.,"After you get past the idea that these people are naked and have sex on camera for a living, you can see the beautiful art of Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. Looking at these people's faces when the have clothes on and when they don't shows the true nature of people.It's a beautiful work on art once you get past the immature ""they're naked"" thing!"
3,xxx;Porn-Star Portraits,"Actually I really like this book and have recommended it to several other friends,the normal day/porn look is really interesting and has you eventually focusing on their eyes,and hands to look for similarities. The bios and additional text was really fun to read as well. i'm happy that this is in my book collection."
4,What is a Pornstar?,I find the book to be a complete review of the most recient pornstars ant the information on each one was quite informative. I would prchase thos book again if I did not own it.
5,Great Coffee Table Book....,"....provided there are no children in the home. If you can appreciate nudity from an artistic perspective, you will enjoy this book. There is nothing sexual here -- just beautifully done photos."
2,Not too impressed....,"....with the photos, that is. The text I enjoyed reading. What surprised me was that, although I don't find porn stars to be at the top of the list when it comes to beauty, the pictures of them were rather blah. Their faces looked weathered and I saw too many veins criss-crossing their naked (...). For instance, porn star Janine normally looks attractive (for a porn star, that is) but the nude picture of her had her holding up saggy-looking (...) with her arms crossed under them. And her face looks like it has really aged. Same with Jenna Jameson. And Nina Hartley's photos? I don't even want to go there! I guess when you take away all the fancy lighting and excessive make-up and intentional posing, they look even cruddier than I thought they did before."
4,Nude Model reviews XXX book,"Hey I personally have met Jenna Jameson and Ron Jeremy at Internext in Las Vegas and they were so cool!!!This book definetely exemplifies that porn is mainstream!The pictures are beautiful (the nude and non-nude photos)of all the porn stars showcased in the book.And my friend, Lukas Ridgeston, is also featured on the back cover of the book!! He is one the sweetest and kindest gay porn stars you will ever meet.I am very happy that this photography book came out to showcase that porn stars can be beautiful and can be photographed in a tasteful manner.Timothy Greenfield-Sanders really shows that his work can be put into a coffee table book filled with porn stars, and who would ever that up?A great collectible photography book, even if you are not into porn stars."
2,XXX : 30 Porn-Star Portraits,Great coffee table book if you don't have children! Classy and beautiful at the same time!!
3,"A Little Good, A Little Bad, Some Indifferent","The photos are more interesting than the text. Beyond the standard issue-style bio sheets of the stars, the other writings were filler/pseudointellectual at best.Per the photographs, what many refer to as ""flaws"" are actually accurate depictions of physical and emotional growth and aging. Nina Hartley looks just as good for her age as Sunrise Adams does for hers. I appreciate that the contrast was embraced and upheld with no effort made to have the former look like the latter!The grouping is diverse with an excellent race and age range, it didn't smack of ""tokenism"" in any respect."
1,Pffft!!!,"This excuse for artsy fartsy legitimacy of the tacky porn empire of lame Vivid Video is obvious.What the f%^k do fat old whiteboys like Gore Vidal and Salman Rushdie and a weirdo like John Malkovich whose sexual preference is always in doubt and let's not forget old geek queen Roger Waters, what do these chumps know of porn?All this book shows is the truth:Vivid Girls really ain't all that and most are quite ugly.(Note that only one black man and woman were chosen for these layout. Can y'all say ""tokenism""?)"
5,-Worth a listen!!-,"New country artist Jimmy Wayne is definatly worth a listen! He's got such talent and this CD shows that in 3 different ways! Not only do you get two versons of the song, but the CD is enhanced with the ""Stay Gone"" video. His voice is wonderful and his talent is beyond belief! Jimmy Wayne definatly has me sold!"
5,"The ""ULTIMATE"" Country Music Performer","Jimmy Wayne is the ultimate performer. With his great voice, outstanding looks and his perfect song writing ability, you couldn't ask for anything better. Way to go Jimmy Wayne!!!"
5,Awesome!,This is one of the greatest songs I've heard in a long time! It is very true. I would recommend for anyone to buy the CD. Its amazing! You'll enjoy every song on the CD.
5,BIG HIT,I think this song hits the spot for some relationships. I believe it is going to be a big hit.
5,Absolutey Wonderful,"Jimmy Wayne,is absolutely one of the most talented country music artist. I was so fortunate to see Jimmy in concert.The song Stay Gone,is such a wonderful song. I personally,believe that no one can perform that song like he can.Jimmy,will be one of the most loved,and popular artist around.The song Stay Gone,perfomed by Jimmy Wayne is a perfectexample as to why,I feel the way I do. I am a huge fan!!!Angela Brimhall"
5,Jimmy Wayne is AWESOME!!!,"Jimmy Wayne is AWESOME!! He is a must see as well as a must buy for the CD on Tuesday. He was just here in North Charleston, SC and was GREAT!! After the concert he signed autographs and talked to everyone like he had know them all their lives. The song STAY GONE is just the beginning for him. He will have many more to come and will be around for a long time to come!"
5,Stay Gone,Jimmy Wayne is an awesome new entertainer. Stay Gone was written about a personal experience in his life and I think he shows extraordinary talent in expressing those feelings with his writing and vocal talent. A great CD. Gotta buy it.
1,Thar (s)he blows!,"Seriously, both of Jimmy Wayne's hits (Stay Gone and Love You This Much) are examples of the very worst that Country music has to offer. I know that most art comes from pain, but I hope that most of it has more to offer than self-indulgent whining."
1,Garbage...........Supreme Garbage,"Don't be fooled by the misleading titles or the two-for-one movie offer because both these movies are supreme garbage. The plot........well there really isn't one. The acting.........what acting? Special effects.................non-existent. Save your money........for if you buy this disk the only enjoyment you shall receive is using it as a frisbee and tossing it out the top-floor window of your home. Hey, that's not a bad idea."
5,ALL GOOD - BUT ONE GREAT!!!!,"In the early 80's, I heard the Cornelia Street Singers at Folk City. I bought the LP. After all these years, ""Say Goodbye Love"" by Simon and Kaplansky remains one of the best recordings ever made. Lucy Kaplansky is FANTASTIC. With a bit of promotion, and better distribution, Say Goodbye Love could have been a major seller. I can't say enough about this recording; it must be heard......TONY TRAIN, Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, NYC"
4,Great; Somewhat similar to Bachata rosa,"This album is beatiful. It does look a bit like Juan Luis Guerra's and the 440 Bachata Rosa, but obviously is much better recorded. Execution is great in the instrumental part. There seems to be however some kind of problem with the microphone and Gloria's voice, seems the microphone resonates to her voice which creates un unpleasant sound when taken to very high volumes. I do not think this is noticeable in the CD version, but in speakers with good resolution and SACD it is. Still, I keep on listening to it time and time again."
3,My wife's 16+ year old mic is better,"I was expecting this mic will sound and will pick up voice better than my wife's 16+ year old mic, but it wasn't. I compared it side by side and the old mic can pick up voice in any angle better than this one. It's okay as long as you talk on top of the mic and not on its top-side."
5,Performance review,"This is my second book purchase through Amazon. Unfortunately my first purchase was the worst decision I could have made.However my latest purchase from a different distributor far excelled my highest expectations. Whether it be price, delivery or quality i could not expect better."
2,More 'cute' than 'classic'...,"I love the yuppie/buppie/bap/preppy movement and enjoy reading and purchasing books on these topics. I read about this book and thought it would be a fun read, in the same vain as The BAP Handbook. I was put off by the price, but I thought it would be worth it to have a 'classic', as it has been referred, in my collection. Less than 100 pages, it was a very quick read with not much substance. The entire book is just filled with lists (what buppies like to eat, where buppies like to vacation, pasttimes of the buppie set, etc.) and antiquated/cartoonish drawings scattered throughout. It was not what I was expecting and really not worth the cost. I say it's a pass, unless you really just want to have a piece of 'buppie history' to add to your book collection."
5,I really like these strings,These strings are very workable. I just began playing the guitar (for the third time) and a guitar shop owner recommended light silk and steel strings to ease the pain on my fingertips while they formed calluses. Worked well.
3,The Metalcore of Electronic Music,"Hearing ""Unborn baaaaby!"" immediately before a thousand MPH beat runs you over never fails to get a laugh from me; Aaron Funk has a sense of humor, and it shows on Making Orange Things. THIS is the metalcore of electronic music. There's almost a novelty-like quality to how extremely heavy, twisted, and distorted the sound of this album is. So much, that its to the point where its almost laughable (but in a good way!). Ridiculously distorted voice samples, jackhammer-esque beats, and headache-inducing noises as gritty as the dirty bathroom depicted on the album cover are present from start to finish. In fact, there's so much of it that it begins to wear out its welcome early on, despite the fact that the album's just barely over 40 minutes in length. I feel like there could have been a little more variety, but maybe thats not what Aaron was going for on Making Orange Things. Its loud, its abrasive, its even dark at times, but its definitely not for everyone. ;)"
3,Good work Ms. McDonald,"I thought the book was well written. I brought the book for my daughter and when she finished reading it she told me I should read it, so I did and I was held spell bound. The story was well written and I hope the author continues to write more stories that will captivate the mind of her audience. Looking for more books similar"
2,ZANE WANNABEE,"The book starts off strong and finishes weak. It reminded me a lot of Addicted by Zane, but this author lacks the descriptions and feeling that should have been in the book. The book also is not very believable in certain parts and is going way too fast."
4,A true erotica novel,"This author needs more recognition, she is a true talent, her work speaks for itself. I did notice a few grammatical errors in the book, but minus those trivial erros the book gets two thumbs up, I liked the way the author avoided male bashing and I liked how she kept the story real as far as detail. I know without a shadow of a doubt that this writer will go far in her journey. Good writers come rare, but she is on top of her game."
4,Off the Chain!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The book has a riveting story line that keeps you captivatedfrom start to finish. I can't wait till I see it hit the big screen. Overall I thought the author did and excellentjob on her debut. Keep doing your thing April.
4,Hazelnuts,Product was ok. Never purchased hazelnuts this way. Much easier than cracking them yourself but too easy to eat too many at one time!
5,It really works!!!,"This product has helped my 11 year old Basset Hound. The ingredients are not far off of Dasuquin, which is almost three times more expensive!!! He thinks they are treats too!!"
1,Where's the Smell?,"Can you say ""tiny""? The product photo must have been taken using a digital microscope! I opened the package and almost missed the box... inside which contained a bottle that a baseball team of ants (that's ""9"" for you sports-challenged types) would have a tough time fitting inside. All this and scent...aroma...odor...huh? Where's the smell?"
3,Didn't work as advertised,I purchased this in order to upgrade the picture of my Wii and was very disappointed when the picture in S-video was worse that the composite video.I kept it rather than go through the hassle of sending it back.So don't waste your money on this one.Instead if you have an extra set of componant video inputs get the componant video cable at the same price.Rick
3,Important only because of who is saying it,"This book has few ideas to put across. (in all reality it is an essay expanded to fill a thin book) kagan correctly makes the case that us is now acting from a position of strength and europe from one of weakness. and then he makes it again. and again. ...it is not an intellectuals book - it glosses over the many drawbacks of the aggressive stance it advocates. kagan makes the analogy that earlier europe was in the position of strength and advocated war and america advocated peaceful solutions when weak. yet, he likes to think that america will avoid all the problems europe faced. again, one sided and narrow in his approach. finally, he sees everything in black and white like much of the current administration - the value of the book stems from the fact that it reveals the thinking of the current team in the white house. other than that, it's opinionated and worthless as literature."
2,Dreamy,"I only got a few pages into this book when I realized the author must be living in a fantasy land. His notions about the ""traditional"" view of Americans is so far from the truth that the remainder of the book seemed hardly worth reading. Americans have been introspective and isolationist for most of American history. Kagan may not like that fact and there may be valid arguments for why the Washingtonian viewpoint does not work well in reality. But, that's a far different matter than rewriting American history and asserting that Americans believe fervently in intervention and meddling in the affairs of other nations. Kagan may wish everyone was as adventerous in practice as he is in theory, but wishing does not make it so."
1,ludicrous,"This book is very poor, its content is often unlogic and the conclusions Robert Kagan draws are absurd.I'd not buy this book if I'd have to decide once again."
1,To Ted Rushton,"I haven't read the book (yet), but I have an issue with one of the reviews. Mr. Rushton, in your review, you stated ""France, under De Gaulle, built a ""force de frappe"" merely to bolster their self-esteem (""frappe"" translates as ""milkshake"").""Actually ""Frappe"" means to hit or strike. Please do not mislead the readers of this site."
5,These poems were written by a woman...,"who had a long illness requiring 17 skin donors for her healing. From her own words in her dedication, it is obvious she had a deep abiding faith to help her through. ""Dedicated to the memory of my dear Mother, who instilled in me, her deep faith in God...""There are four beautiful photo pictures that represent four of the 58 poems inside. These poems are heart touching, for they were birthed from truly heart life experiences."
3,Cold sounding in A Fender Blues Junior,"What makes a good speaker is a matter of personal taste, but for me this speaker was very cold and lifeless.I put back in the stock Jenson ""special design"" speaker and it sounded much better."
4,good pedal exerciser,"I bought this for my mom, it works just fine, the only comment I have is that this exerciser is much taller than the one she had before and you need to sit on a dining room chair or stool in order to work it properly however if you are sitting lower you can still use it but it works better if you are higher up"
3,exercise product,Purchased to use at computer desk for work. Thoroughly enjoy using however need to have the proper chair to sit in. Switched to a straight back chair while using product.
4,Quiet creeper,"I would have given this pedaler 5 stars, but it creeps forward despite the rubber feet (which have grooves in them). It is VERY quiet and easy to use otherwise and provides changes in resistance."
3,Pedal exerciser,"This is a good, but not great, exerciser. It is too light for vigorous exercise, but I read the reviews and knew this before I purchased. The good thing is that it is light enough to be easily lifted off the floor after leg exercises and placed on a table for arm exercises. I would recommend this for the elderly who no longer work out vigorously but still want to stay in shape, or get themselves back in to shape."
3,ok,"I got this product to try and get a simple work out in while watching tv or reading. As other reviews said it does move away from you. To prevent this I bought a rubber door mat with a lip on it and it solved that problem. I am 5'9"" and can not use it while sitting on the couch - I need to sit on a higher kitchen chair. The machine is not heavy enough - the back legs come up as I pedal. I put hand weight on it (10 pounds on each side) and it helps but does not completly solve the problem. Overall the product is ok - but needs some help to make it work well."
2,disappointing,"the plot really had promise, but the writing was very simplistic, and the characters didn't grab me. I stopped reading after 70 pages - I just didn't have the interest to go any further."
5,Great for sensitive semi-dry skin,"Worth the money, and then some. Works like much more expensive creams do, moisturizing without clogging pores. And no nasty fragrances to irritate skin or sensitive noses. I've used this for 10 years, and every time I try something else, I wonder why I bothered."
4,Soothing!,I love how soothing this cream is. I wish there was a version with sunscreen in it that was Feingold approved.
5,Fine knife,"This hard to find knife replaces in my display box the same knife with unserrated blade I carry in my pocket every day. It has a lovely, smooth spring assisted opening action for one hand opening and is a true bargain."
5,My daughter loves this tee-shirt......,My daughter loves this tee-shirt.It is a well made tee-shirt with a nice band inspired design.
5,Book III of the Earth Chronicle series,"To be honest, I have not yet starting reading this book. This is the 3rd book in the Earth Chronicle series. I am currently reading the second book and devoured the first book. The 12th Planet is the first book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in ancient civilization and human culture, its art and deep historic meaning shed light where our current culture provides ignorant knowledge. Sitchin is classic within metaphysical circles and is essential in educating oneself about the 'Gods' and the truth concerning mythlogical origins on our planet. Sitchin's gift is his ability to analyse ancient text directly and logically and then take it to a much higher level than popular culture can even imagine."
4,Too Bad The Bible Isn't This Intersting,"Book III describes the battles of the gods and mankind, their foot soldiers, for the gods' ambitions of power and control. As in the other Earth Chronicle series, the book's basis is backed up by written records, mythology, the Bible and archeological findings.It includes the building of the pyramids, the sphinx, and how records describe the passages inside Giza and why they were constructed, long before they were discovered by archeologists.The most fascinating section of the book matches the biblical tale of Abraham with real historical events, and what can only be described as a nuclear bomb dropped on the Sinai peninsula in 2024 b.c., its link to the gods and to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra in the bible.Like all Sitchin's other books, it forces the reader to look at history in a different perspective, and reassess the accepted paradigm."
1,Garbage for the Gullible,"It took me some time to suspect, and even more time to actually become convinced, that this idiotic garbage is actually meant to be TAKEN SERIUOSLY! like, I mean, to be BELIEVED! It is in fact a cobbling-together of some fairly half-witted 1930s science-fiction plots. To anyone with even a smattering of real scientific or archeological knowledge it is simply beneath criticism, if not beneath a proper contempt. It makes von Daniken look like a disciplined, serious researcher."
3,A BIT DENSE,"Sitchin's work always make for exciting reading, but this one is a bit laboured and heavy on facts, so it doesn't flow as smoothly as the other titles in the series. I take his theories with a pinch of salt, as his Nibiru chronology doesn't make sense to me (If this 12th planet is supposed to come round every 3600 years and cause havoc on earth, it was supposed to have come round in 100BC according to Sitchin's own chronology). But there is no record of any such thing happening in 100BC! So perhaps Nibiru veered off out of the solar system and is now drifting aimlessly through the cosmos! Ha, that would serve the Anu right for having so selfishly interfered on earth."
2,This Scholar Again Opts for the Fantastic,"Ancient mysteries present difficult and complex problems. But not forStichin... seemingly he has all the answers! Sitchin is a scholar, alinguist, and an investigator with an unusual grasp of ancientarcheology and astronomy. Sitchin again posits a fantastic account ofalien intervention as the origin of civilization. However, he fails toprove or even substantially advance his case that extraterrestrialintervention and genetic mutation planted the seeds that would sproutinto the foundation of Earth's civilizations. His work is disguised asscience but it fails by most sstandards of scientific method,documentation and proof."
2,dissappointment really,"I was unhappy with this series of books. It just was not what I expected. Looking for study on Ancient Gods, not just a story. It seems to me, these books are no more than stories based on his opinion, not much history, that I noticed. Nicely written set for great imagination. It seemed more fiction, not actually any facts. Fantasy."
2,I think he is dead wrong,"There is no planet of Nibiru in our solar system. The fartest is Sedna but is to far and to small to be Nibiru. So if aliens ever came to our planet they are not from our solar system. One thnig I can not understand. If they were here 450.000 years ago, where is their civilization I mean? We did it in 5000 years. Things played very difirent in our past. He is dead wrong."
3,good but not great,"I bought this model to save a couple hundred dollars from the other brands, and I can see why there is such a difference in price. It arrived with a broken bracket right out of the box (which I welded back on) and in general appears to be very cheaply made in comparison to the lifts I have rented. With that being said, I am still glad I bought it, once I got it in usable shape I used it to hang an entire house with no real problems. I could load a 12' sheet of drywall on and hang it on the ceiling by myself with no trouble. If you hang alot of drywall, or don't want to spend at least an hour fixing some of the cheaply made brackets, then keep looking... otherwise it is worth the savings."
1,Never delivered,This book was never delievered nor was there any response to my question when I tried to contact the seller. I has been over 5 weeks since my order. I hope that this disappointment doesn't happen to anyone else.
5,Buy it on Amazon!,"Through another site, I purchased a different pattern a month ago for portrait photography, and decided I had to get another one or two of these. This price ($101) is the best I've found on these mats. I havent found them anywhere else less than $150. Perfect for photographing in studio. You can buy multiple and put them together for more area too.In person and natural light, it looks a little grey greenish rather than warm tan as the product shot does, but photographs perfectly! A much better alternative to vinyl drops on the floor. No glare surface, soft, stays put, and doesn't get scuffed or scratched as easily. Looking to get a couple more soon!I think it is a little silly for anyone to complain about the smell. It is made of neoprene like rubber, so of course it is going to smell...like rubber! Use some febreeze or something if it bugs you. ;) I haven't had to wash one yet, but I totally appreciate that you can."
5,Awesome rug!!!,I bought this because of the reviews for using them for photography. These rugs come out so cool in pictures! I will be buying more!
5,Great item for photography very durable!,"The title says it all. It shipped very fast, i love it!!!!! great for childrens pictures! a little smelly at first just let it air out for a couple of days and the smell goes away."
5,Well made.,Perfect for photographing newborns. Not big enough for toddlers really but love this as a background. The material reflects light well and has no sheen to it so it's great for photography.
1,"GREEN floor, not brown","The wood grain in this flooring is green and cream, not brown. I ordered it twice just to be sure. The pictures online look amazing but this floor was FOREST green. Returned! Bumbed!"
1,Another one to watch out for,"I already posted a review of an M42 to EOS adaptor with an aperture stop down ring. I would recommend you find one without this. It can get in the way of the aperture pin on the lens, causing you to lose the ability to focus to infinity, or cause you to cut it off. The rim only makes it so you can't open the aperture at all while on the adaptor, and who wants that? There is another adaptor on Amazon now without a rim, the one made by Bower, I have it and it works flawlessly on my 30D. Buy this only if you have a lens that cannot switch between M and A mode because you'll need the rim to stop down the aperture."
1,seller did not state that 2 chapters were filled in and unusable,"The seller did not state that there were 2 chapters filled in and could not be completed in the workbook. What good was it to purchase a book which only has 3 chapters to be used? At least the seller refunded my purchase price, but not the shipping cost. Seller said they stated it had notes in the margin in the advertisement of the book! Notes in the margin? I found 2 completed chapter of a child's summer workbook, which made the book worthless! I feel they should refund my wasted shipping cost!"
5,"A challenging book on multiple levels,yet worth the effort.","Larry Jetmore, a retired Hartford, CT Police Commander and current university educator, seeks to reawaken the ethical bearing of working police officers.In a short book, less than 140 pages, that is liberally sprinkled with both inspirational quotes from philosophers and pertinent ""war stories"" Jetmore challenges his readers to recapture their ""shadow"".""To become a warrior you must turn your back on the consensus of others, open the gate, cross the bridge and begin the inner quest of your heart and spirit.""In a time when ethics and ethics training are ""hot topics"", Jetmore has contributed a challenging and substantive work that will stand the test of time. It is an actual contribution to the ongoing dialogue within the profession."
5,The Path,I originally purchased this book because I was struggling through many different tribulations. This book was able to keep my attention and push my motivation to keep on with what I knew was in me all along. In turn I bought this to give to others struggling with career and personal decisions. This is a must read!
1,Arrived Broken,"This expensive light bulb arrived in a non working condition. The glass wasn't broken, but parts inside the center piece were rattling."
3,Works well with some modifications,There is too much clearance between the chrome rotator and the black housing. This was fixed with a small piece of paper as a shim. This stand would'nt hold my micrometers at the angle that I wanted. I fixed this by mounting the black housing on the other flat that is on a 45 degree angle in the picture.
2,lots of pages with very small knowledge,The book is not that useful. It has some information but the subjects are told very very slowly. You can just summarize the book in 10 pages or so. Useless...
5,Provides Overall Picture of African Magic - Excellent,"This book, like no other, provides an excellent understanding of how magic is a part of peoples everyday lives, in everyday language without the anthropological speak. In it, you will see magic from the eyes of an african.(More later on contents)I cannot recommend this book more. I am surprised this book is not more readily available.Read my other reviews for some good books on Africa."
4,Great reminder,This video is a great reminder about a dynamic musical group. There is nothing new here but some interesting videos of the group is some unusal settings. Fun to watch and a great leadoff to some meandering down memory lane.
3,The Airplane Takes Off,"This is a rather enjoyable short history of the Airplane, one of the seminal San Francisco rock bands of the sixties, and certainly one of the top 2 or 3 bands in the Psychedelic genre. There are very few surprises here, but there are additional special clips that are more personal than the film piece itself. All the band members are present and talk about the old days, rather surprising because most bands have lost musicians to the big concert hall in the sky. Even Spencer Dryden is here, although he has died since this film was made. Not for the casually interested, this video is more for the faithful or those wanting a different view of the heyday of Psychedelic pop and 60s San Francisco music scene."
5,Great Rocumentary!!!,"A must see and have for all true fans of rock... This DVD does a real good job bringing the historical sights and sounds together. It is well done and very interesting. This was a great band that made some great and unique music! There is also no doubt, they ruled the psychedelic era..."
3,A Puff-piece,"I like this DVD, but it contains a lot of fluff. 'Concert' footage that is really overdubbed by the studio versions. Fairly un-revealing commentary from band members and so on as other reviews have referenced.But despite these disappointments, the whole DVD is almost worth it for about 15mins, that includes 1)footage of the rooftop performance in New York and 2) by far the best musical piece for me being Jorma Kaukonen playing an acoustic piece at the end at Hall of Fame induction.JA's stage presence didn't really set the world on fire - this was a revelation for me.Conclusion, save your money and if you don't have them already, get 'Crown of Creation' and 'Bless It's pointed Little Head'. None of the music on the DVD really reaches these heights.Watching it once or twice is enough for me."
1,Become an astronaut?,"Wanna be a fireman? An astronaut? A playwright? An evangelist? Then buy this book, it will tell you how! You get the idea. This short volume is best suited for the curious career seeker (ages 8 and up), not the serious professional interested in examining the possibilities. I have no idea who wrote the other reviews, but I wonder if they were paid!"
4,Good product,I take these mainly to for skin health. They seem to help. I like that they don't have a magnesium stearate filler.
2,unforunatley not (2) good,"I am from Australia so I had a chance to listen to this album alot earlier than the Americans did. Olivia Newton-John is our most famous Aussie export and it's a shame I have to put down this album,but i'm afraid it's not that good. Olivia works with some really great talent on this album which is suprising it's not better but that is only my opinion. The highlights on this album are songs perfromed with Darren Hayes from Savage Garden and the late Peter Allen,it's sad the songs with Tina Arena and Billy Thorpe weren't more exciting. I just found the songs to be really simple and the lyrics basically written,I guess Olivia was just concerned with singing duets with these people rather than the quality of the songs. The worst part is I absolutley love Olivia and think she is so beautiful and a wonderful singer,but i'm speaking as a disapointed fan. Buyers beware."
4,Missing track,"Watch your orders ...Other reviewers talk of a 12th track -- a hidden rendition of Physical that is definitely on my CD -- but my players still only label this surprise number 11 on my version. I'm missing Love You Crazy with Human Nature from my disk.It's listed as number 6 on my cover and in the liner notes -- they even give me the words to it! -- but no song.Sloppy production standards?The rest of the album is so good, I'm disappointed to lack a note"
5,AWESOME!!!...,This is an absolute winner. What a pleasure to hear Olivias' classic voice blended with other distinctive pop voices like Michael McDonald and Richard Marx. The duet with Tina Arena should be a single - it is excellent. The entire cd is solid and satisfying.Olivia (2) deserves a grammy nod.EXCELLENT!!!...
5,Simply Superb!,"From the opening track, a majestic country rock homage to Olivia's homeland on 'Sunburned Country,' to the passionate and sweeping Broadway-calbre love ballads 'I Will Be Right Here' and 'Never Far Away,' to the deeply soulful jazzy re-interpretation of the classic hit 'Physical' (a hidden bonus track after the last track), to the rockabilly yearnings of 'Bad About You,' to the contemporary pop stylings of 'Lift Me Up' and 'Love You Crazy,' and back in time again to the sweet retro-1950s sounds of 'I'm Counting on You' and 'Happy Day,' nothing before has demonstrated so well on a single album the extensive range and versatility of Olivia's musical artistry and emotive abilities. Simply superb!"
3,For fans only?,"Overrated by ONJ fans, this collection of duets has a lot to be desired. Nothing really memorable. Hopefully a new solo cd will not take five years to see the light of day!"
1,"Love you Olivia, but time to get your act together","Having lived in Australia for a decade, all I can think of is this album truly lives up to the popular level of Oz rock; ie very very dull.A bunch of ordinary and some below par numbers, this is not inspiring by far. Why not an album of women's songs - by such great writers as Tori Amos, Jane Siberry and all?I had been personally waiting for a renaissance by olivia since the mid-80s, so I guess maybe it's now too late to ask the Pet Shop Boys, Nick Cave or Morrissey for a number or two."
1,Is it really good?,"I was concerned with Olivia's previous release, Back With A Heart CD, wherein her vocals sounded somewhat declined. But I'm considering to get this CD after reading all the postive reviews here."
2,neutron bomb,"It's very brave of Olivia to step out out from the shadow (and a large shadow it is as well) of the mighty John Travolta, and at first listen, this CD will reward the casual listener with its twee pop twitterings, and melodic inventiveness. However, there is no ""Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee (reprise)"", and that, for me, is a fatal mistake."
5,Wonderful applied resource,"This review refers to the first edition, which, aside from the dated computer programs used for analyses, discusses a variety of topics that are not typically covered in traditional regression texts. Especially valuable is chapter 9 which consists of a situation where using a combination of linear and nonlinear fits simultaneously, complete with both qualitative and quantitative data. A great extension past books like Draper and Smith and Myers and Montgomery."
1,1980 published book,"I have not yet read the book, so I'll leave the content to others. However be aware that this is a ""Wiley Classics Library"" book. Although published in 1999 it is a reprint of the 1980 version. The book was geared to use a computer program called LINWOOD (and related programs) on punch cards. Michael R. Chernick reviewed this book twice."
2,Lots of attitude but little talent,"I can see being moved by this high energy/big attitude band when seen live, but, in a recorded context, this sounds really silly. I'm all for angst and emotion to be channeled through music but this is way too contrived. Some of these songs are utterly ridiculous. From the beginning, pop music has alway embraced lust, libidos and decadence but this band uses no artistry to address it.I was attracted to this band because of the documentary made about them. When interviewed, the band members sound well-spoken and intelligent. Therefore, the gutteral lyrics are all the more an indictment on the laziness of them not trying to produce art rather than just muttering stupid sophmoric lyrics."
5,One of the Best Culture releases,"This cd offers up the goods. A heavy, upbeat roots cd with some really heavy riddims that will keep you wanting to move to the music. Joseph Hills vocals are pure roots and just a magical blend with the music. Every song here is a winner. I recommend this to all lovers of music PERIOD. Pick it up and you will not be disappointed. Also pick up ONE STONE and Peace and Love...two of my other favorites by Culture (and I have them all...stay away from Humble African...not so good)."
3,Heard better things from Culture than this album but still ok,"All Good Things is not a bad album but I guess I just expected it to be better. I own more roots reggae than most major record stores and have always been a fan of Culture since Two Sevens Clash but this album, while still better than most other reggae albums, is just satisfactory. Worth buying only for serious Culture fans.."
5,Excellent Diagrams and Illustrations,Need to learn stuff and be ready for exams in a hurry? This book is an excellent reference provided with clear explanations for understanding Human Physiology with illustrated features broken down into step by step instructions and/or diagrams and tables to help grasp information quickly when the instructions in class a little unclear. A MUST HAVE and A MUST READ!
3,It is what it is.,"I bought this EXPENSIVE book for my physiology class and I guess it does its job however, I don't think it is the best book out there. This author is into the idea of giving the reader a bit of information and then wants you to go look/research the rest. I paid a lot of money for this book and I would prefer the information is all there. I don't think the CD is helpful at all either. New books have an access code for reader to view notes and quizzes on line which is a bit more helpful."
3,A reasonably good item for the money.,"I own many various tools and tool sets and generally go with high quality items. I don't always purchase THE most expensive, but they are very highly rated. I must add here that I am not a professional, so I fall into the class of do-it-yourself weekend warrior. My projects are fairly regular and range anywhere from easy to a need for some real knowledge of the job at hand. I decided to try this set, because of the overall variety of bits included in the package. For moderate use it will work out fine, but for heavy use this set is not the answer. For anything I use on a fairly regular basis, I will spend the extra dollars on better quality. Hence, if you want a set like this for steady use, look at something else."
3,Detailed but uninspiring,"I had high hopes for this book, especially considering the favorable reviews, but I must confess that I found the book to be lacking in narrative flow and, sorry to say, boring. I was also mildly annoyed that the author labels most every doctor of discussion a 'polymath.'"
2,Pedestrian.,The author writes as if he has been an employee of the Wellcomes -- the I.G. Farben of British medicine -- a lot too long. A history of the medical profession is not a history of humanity -- or solely of doctors! Limited in its perspective and unenlightened by contemporary approaches to history and historicism. Anecdotally entertaining -- and so is the average coffee-table book.
2,Tedious,"When I read the NYTimes review of this book I bought it with anxious anticipation. After all, years ago I had absolutely loved Rene Dubos' ""The Mirage of Health"". However, this book was like wading through knee deep mud. So much for the book reviews in the papers. I know it is a gargantuan task, but someone needs to write a really interesting, flowing, readable book (or a series of books) about this fascinating subject. I also realize that much about this subject is unknown or speculation, but still..."
2,more a reference than a good read,"this book is not easy to read. it reads like an encyclopedia, and a bad one at that. i could only bear a few hundred pages of it before i felt that i was wasting my time. only for the serious medical history student."
2,A continental history of medicine,"While anyone will admit that a complete history of medicine is a daunting task, Roy Porter manages to fall far short of his goal. The author purports to write a history of medicine but brings a distinctively European slant to the topic. He relegates American medical triumphs as eventual consequences of the medical knowledge originating in Europe. In addition he compensates for a lack of substance with a painful abundance of detail. There is a good discussion of ""alternative"" medicine, but the author asserts the superiority of Western Medicine and then neglects the topic. The result is a disjointed and painful read that can only appeal to diehard medical historians."
4,JB and Job,"This play in verse is a modern take on one of the timeless questions of suffering during our lives.In this instance,JB loses his wealth, health and family and during the ensuing discussions with his ""friends"", it beomes evident that the story is not about suffering, but about faith.Very powerful,but short, descriptive scenes and dialogue."
4,Modern take,"Macleish's modern rendition of the Book of Job does an adequate job of converting the serious tale to a modern almost circus like story. Although sardonic at times, he keeps the main focus intact: WHY DO THE RIGHTEOUS SUFFER?"
5,Good Microwave...,"Pretty standard, it works fine, next time I'll go for the Stainless Steel. Bigger interior than expected. It's fine."
3,CANNOT turn OFF beeping SOUND on ANY Emerson microwave,"As cheap microwaves goes, I have not had any operational problems with mine.The only thing is that you CANNOT TURN OFF the annoying beeping sound on ANY of Emerson's microwave - at least that is what the Emerson hotline rep said (she did not know why either). So if you need a quiet microwave or just like heating food up in the middle of the night with a sleeping household, DO NOT GET an Emerson microwave."
2,Short lived microwave,We had this for around 2 years and suddenly there was what looked like an electrical storm inside the microwave. I contacted Emerson to see about a replacement and unless its still under warranty (which its not) we were pretty much out of luck. I would not recommend buying this product unless you only want it for a year or two.
1,Ours just blew up,"I saw it arc. BOOF! No reason, no misuse. Just a big flash of blue light.It lasted only 1 1/2 years. I will not buy any more Emerson products."
1,"Tiresome, egotistical trash","With the release of The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II A Book, Wyclef has once again lowered the standards of hip-hop. I'd give the album 0 stars if I could; this recording certainly qualifies....The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II A Book is the most painful hip-hop longplayer you're likely to hear all year, this year or any year. Wyclef is like a pop music search engine, returning tons and tons of useless, irrelevant trash.The Fugees may not need him but he needs the Fugees."
5,Another Hip-Hop Masterpiece,Wyclef has done it again. Masterfully weaving old school guitar with new age hip hop Wyclef is able to show us that hip hop has not died with the break up of A Tribe Called Quest. Filled with catchy hooks and soulful lyrics this is a must own
2,richard diagnosis,"His album was very good but he could of did better.Compared to the carnival, all the songs were perfect. On this album, he only has one good song ""thug angels"". That's my opoinon."
1,not so good,this cd had like 2 listenable songs. the rest was garbage it doesn't even have any great songs like staying alive. seems like he was trying to jump on the rocks bandwagon. and trying to rap to kenny rogers. he ruined a good song there.
4,gift cd,I can not really review this product as it was a gift. I heard no negative feedback so I expect this to be an ok product!!!
5,A fantastic album (one of the best),This album has got to be one of the best albums available. Whether you are (like me) or are not a Wyclef Jean fan you are sure to love this album. Just as the title implies it has a great range of songs - from hip and funky to soft and mellow. I can not sing its praises enough - definitely a great buy!
4,"A very weak ""4""","this cd gives you very mixed feling's, on one hand it is very good, i mean just listen to ""diallo"" ""911"" or ""runaway"" which all are ver.. umm excuse me, EXTREMLY god songs. But on the other hands many of the songs are kinda' innoying, they aren't bad.. I don't know, mayBE it's all about taste, and mayBE i ain't the one to judge anyway since i'm not a real hip-hopper or something, but anyway this cd goes away with a very weak four, much because of three certain songs.. hmmm i wonder which?P.S. if you like wyclef buy his latest ""the preacher's son"". it's a lot a better"
1,you call this drivel brilliant?,"Okay- a number of points:what's up with the rock rapping on it doesn't matter? wyclef is obviously trying to appeal to the lowest form of life: the wrestling fanThen there are the covers: kenny rogers on a remake of his already horrible song the gambler? uh, no.. then there's wyclef's butchering of one of pink floyd's greatest songs, wish you were here.starting to see a trend? look at wyclef's track record, all of his other hit songs took big chunks of or complete coverslook: killing me softly, his john cale collaboration, that track he did for the when we were kings soundtrack w. a tribe called quest, his redoing of the bee gee's staying alive....you get the picturewanna hear brilliance? try my bloody valentine, the beastie boys, de la soul, or sonic youthEND TRANSMISSION"
5,Excellent sound,"Purchased 6 of the Polk RC6-S speakers for a spa I opened. For the price point, I thought they may not have high enough output or sound quality, but I was wrong...these speakers produce plenty of volume and sound great using only one speaker per ~144 sq ft room. I did need to add a second speaker to a room that was 300 sq ft. Install was very easy with the provided templates."
5,Great little speaker!!,"I am very impressed with this speaker. I have two of them installed above my pool table. So far they do everything I wanted to do. I mainly use them for background music, but have turned them up and have been impressed with their sound quality. I'm am not an audiophile, but am very selective and I think for how much this speaker costs you are truly getting a great deal."
3,Notes on Alford,"If you are a fan of Alford's music, you have to buy this. If you love Alford's music, you will probably be disappointed. This group (supposedly the band that Alford led for years) played all the notes, but they clearly didn't love it. There is no passion in the performance, and a group who can't get passion out of ""Army of the Nile"", ""By Land and Sea"", ""Eagle Squadron"", or ""Standard of St. George"" is lacking. Some of this is the size of the group - only 34 players. Everything is thin, and middle/low woodwinds are practically missing. Bring on University of Tennessee or Michigan bands and this would be wonderful! On a plus note, discovery and inclusion of the ""Vesper Hymn"" is great. Wonder how much more terrific stuff is buried in Alford's papers."
2,Just doesn't sound like America,"Released in 1984, this would be America's last studio album for a decade. America uses a hodge-podge of producers and abandons their trademark acoustic-based pop/rock. While it works on some of the songs, I think there are more misses than hits on this album. It produced two minor hits, Special Girl and Can't Fall Asleep To A Lullaby. Best songs are Stereo, We Got All Night, and Cinderella. This is probably America's weakest effort."
2,Not that good,"I think this is America's worst album of all time. They abandon their traditional sound for an 80's synth-pop sound and it just doesn't work. There are a few good songs on it, like Cinderella and Stereo, but overall this is not a good album. Only for the hardcore America fan who must own all their material (like me)."
3,Terribly unfocused.,"I bought this play because John Spencer, one of my favorite actors, was in the first production some twenty years ago. Unfortunately, this play just wasn't a very satisfying read. The playwright interviewed a Vietnam Vet, his wife, and his mistress, and created this play based on what the real people actually said.Unfortunately, this means the the play is kind of schizophrenic, with no particular point of view. Instead of choosing certain things the real people talked about to create a cogent narrative, the Emily Mann seemed to just present everything that they said without any kind of filter. In the end, it's just really unfocused.I thought maybe this play would have been more relevant some twenty years ago, but I looked up a few reviews of the original production, and apparently I'm not the only one who felt the script lacked direction."
4,"""Phunk Shui"" is ""All Good People""","No, that's not a translation but the only difference between this and ""Phunk Shui"" is that it has the bonus track ""Mona Lisa's Eyes"", that was previously available only on the ""PS"" import album.Best tracks: ""Color of Love"" and ""Love In A Dangerous Time"" (which is also featured on Daryl Hall & John Oates' ""Do It For Love"" album and has improved production. I highly recommend ""Do It For Love"" also."
1,Gary Taubes Has A Lot of Explaining To Do,"Well, now it's 2004, eleven years after Gary Taubes eulogy to Cold Fusion, ""Bad Science : The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion"". Unfortunately for Mr. Taubes, science eventually sorts things out and figures out what's real and what's not real. Well, now fifteen years after the big Pons & Fleischmen announcement, it turns out that Cold Fusion is on the cusp of regaining legitmacy in the scientific community. Not only has the U.S. Navy revealed a decade of clandestine Cold Fusion research, but numerous reputable labs around the world have verified that the Cold Fusion is real.While a well written, and fairly well researched book, Mr. Taubes' burial of Cold Fusion is going to more of a historical artifact in the long saga of Cold Fusion than the definitive last word for this controversal field of science. Seems like Mr. Taubes is going to have to update this book soon, with an admission that he missed the mark in 1993."
1,The Truth Will Set You Free - But Not In This Book,"You might want to check this link for a different perspective.[...]Never rush to judgement. :-)---------------""Here is a public demo, created by someone who truly understands the scientific method. It comes complete with plans to build a machine capable of making a brew. Do not let the dementors blind you. You are better than them. Go and make that tea.The Celani paper."""
5,Great results,"I have read all the most recent reviews on this product. My dogs were on the Synovi product, but we decided to give this a try. It does contain soybean oil as indicated in one of the reviews, however, none of my seven corgis had issues with this. Only two of my dogs were in real need of joint help, but with all my dogs being equally as active and relatively the same age we have been giving it as a preventative to all the others to help them live happy, pain-free lives. The two that had joint issues showed response rather quickly in about two weeks of dailiy dosage. We are reordering this product, but in the three-pack this time. Every dog is different, but give these a try. If your dog doesn't respond to them, or if they responded better on another treatment, then by all means switch. My dogs love the taste and I even get to sneak meds into the chew if need be! Great product in our house!"
4,Soft Chews,"Always a good product for my dog, who was quite old and had arthritis. I've ordered these chews for a while and my dog always loved getting them. She felt they were treats."
1,Warning - overdose of this product killed my neighbor's dog,"Like some other reviewers, my neighbor raved about how great these supplements tasted to her dogs who gobbled them up like treats. Unfortunately, one of the dogs got into the sealed container on a countertop and ingested about 75-100 of these; in spite of excellent vet care, the dog died due to liver failure from the extreme overdose.If you buy this product, keep it in a very secure place where there is no possible way your dog can access them."
5,Joint Max Chews Rock!,"My dogs were on Rimadyl until I found out how harmful Rymadyl is to their liver. And they seemed to stop getting any benefit from the Rymadyl. So, I weened them off of the Rimadyl slowly, until they were, and still are taking the Joint Max. They are more playful, and stopped limping around. It's almost like they are young again!"
4,Will buy more,My 11 year old chocolate lab seemed like she was getting creakier by the day. Decided to try these and her a lot more playful and agile. Now my 11 yr old black lab and 6 month old puppy want her yummy liver treats too! Will buy more.
4,Nice Product But Little Chondroitin Sulphate,"Contains only 100mg of chronroitin sulphate per two soft chews. Cosequin DS contains much more, which may account for its apparent greater effectiveness. My dog seems to do better on the Cosequin, although it it is much more difficult to administer than the Joint Max, My dog loves to eat the Joint Max product. I use both products."
3,"Nice formulation, poor palatibility for my dogs","The ingredients in Joint Max Triple Strength seem just right for my 9 year old golden (who is a bit arthritic) and my 6 year old golden with a reconstructed knee. But part way through the first tub they both began to refuse to eat them as a separate treat. In order to finish the tub I had to hide them in their dinner. They are typical retrievers and are not picky, so i don't know why they simply refused to eat this product any longer (the chews were properly stored and only a weeks worth were removed from the container and inner bag at a time). Of course you may or may not have this issue with your dog."
4,Dogs love it!,"This is the first time I have purchased this product so I can only attest to one thing so far. My dogs love this stuff! I have one dog with very bad knees and hips. He is limping less and running more, so far. They have had 80% of the bucket. I understand it gets better as they take more of it. So far so good."
4,Old dog needs help,"My dog is 12 yrs old with hip dispacia and arthritis. I tried the joint max treats but she didnt like them. The company worked with me to try to find the right supplement. They mailed me Joint max soft chews. I was trying to find something comparable to Synovi G3. These treats are the same. They smell the same, she enjoys eating them and they are working. I give it a 4 out of 5 because there is not a dramatic difference but that may be because my dog is getting close to being beyond help. Excellent customer service."
5,I truly seem to see a difference in my dog!,"Due to an accident my dalmatian, Tyler, only has 3 legs. I've been giving him gluccosime supplements off and on through the years. Every time I forget to buy them i do notice a difference. I tried a couple other brands, yet my dog never seems to like the taste, yet joint max he gobbles up.. Great product!"
5,RIDE ON SHOOTING STAR!,This song is the stick! It is the theme song for FLCL and just plane rocks out. I have it stuck in my head forever now. IT rocks!
1,Never arrived,"I ordered these and they never arrived. The seller told me to get some sort of paperwork from the USPS to prove that they didn't come, but they weren't expensive enough to warrant that much trouble on my part. I'd suggest they ship them via UPS or FedEx so it could be tracked. I bought similar ones elsewhere instead."
5,"Easy to use, accurate","If you're a light smoker (1-2 cig a day), this test kit will show negative result after 4 days of quitting. It will show positive result when you start smoking again."
4,"Works, But...","This test did detect the presence of nicotine, but I should have bought a more sensitive test. My son claimed he was ""in a room with people who were smoking"", and there was no way to tell if that was the case."
2,How do you use this thing?,"I heard good things from this product.However, I am almost ready to admit that I cannot figure out how to use it. . . I usually get running with a new program quickly; but that is not the case this time.I have seen dedicated gps navigation devices for around $150. My system, in contrast, counting PDA, memory cards, software, bluetooth enabled GPS extra battery, case; etc. . .set me back by about $700.I will only recommend this product to somebody that is willing to take a lot of frustration."
5,Core Fusion collection,"This is a really great program. I have chronic fatigue syndrome and my doctor told me I had to try a different type of exercise. This really fit the bill. There is no jumping up and down, but I feel like I did something after each one. They have 10 minute segments so you can work up to the full workout. I have been doing it for 3 weeks now and I have more stamina and energy than before. I highly recommend this product."
3,"Excellent muscle toning but oh, so boring.","Yes, I am in agreement with all the reviewers who say how very effective the movements in these DVDs are. Small, repetitive, and very challenging muscle movements that I know would be very toning and good for me. Unfortunately, these DVDs in the exercise world are the equivalent, to me, in the gastronomic world of a plate full of steamed broccoli without even any salt on it (i.e., boring). I'm not super fond of exercising so I need to do things that are more entertaining. I like steps, weights, motivating music, seeing a class full of exercisers following the leader, etc. Liz and Fred in their dark room with their boring music just doesn't get me motivated enough. Yes, I realize this is a defect in me, not in their DVDs, but I just can't make myself do them very often."
2,Disagree with Most Reviewers,"I bought this set based on good price and great reviews - I was very disappointed.I have a large collection of workout dvds but after using each of these twice I'll be deleting the set from my collection. 1)The lighting is bad, with no close up views, makes it very hard to see what the two instructors are doing. 2)particularly on the Thighs and Glutes section the moves are VERY hard on the knees, same with parts of the Body Sculpt. 3)The woman is okay in her instruction, the man is annoying in his commentary. 4)Its a fairly dull set of exercises.I liked some of the exercises and the 10' sectioning, but really, be careful of the moves that stress your knees and any others that don't feel right for you. My knees still hurt."
2,Never judge a CD by its cover,Nice picture on Cd cover. Music content was a mess. Not my idea of a day at the beach. Keep looking.
2,Used Book The Seasons of a Man's Life,"The book is a great book that I read back in the 80's and wanted to pass it on to my grandson. The book is in tact, but it looks like it was stored without the benefit of climate control. All the pages have turned yellowish brown and it smells. Since I wanted to gift it to my Grandson, it makes it less desirable to give to anyone in this condition. Of course, the main expense was the shipping.I have ordered other books with you all, even the used ones, have all been in great condition. This is the first one that has been a disappointment."
2,Dated Material,This book reads like a bad psych textbook from the 60's & 70's; because thats basically what it is. There are some masculine universal truths but you really have to search for them. The case studies & occupations are dated & irrelivent to baby boomers in the 21st century and not very helpful IMHO. Still there are a few pearls and saving graces but you really have to work hard to read this one.
2,Too dated to be of much use,"A nice try at defining life stages but this book misses the mark. It's too culture-bound to be of much use to anyone other than white middle-class American baby boomers. If you are one of those - as I am - you may recognise yourself in this book up to a point, but I doubt you will learn much that's new. As other reviewers have pointed out, it would have been a groundbreaking book in the 1970's, but these days you'll find similar information and analysis in the lifestyle pages of most Sunday papers."
5,Great book,"Great book, great read for everyone. Author discusses the primary phases of adulthood in great detail, and very thought provoking way. Book discusses the life cycle as several distinct phases that we all go through one way or another. Having going through a transition myself, reading ""Seasons"" is an eye opener. If anything the more you know about your own transition, the better you can deal with it. Also, the phases help in understanding others too. Season's work will no doubt last for many generations to come."
3,OK up to middle age.,Good overview but a bit outdated. My major disapointment was that there is very little discussion past early middle age.
3,Review Seasons of a Mans Life,"A very good book, however my copy is quite old, and ofcourse so I am...(58). I wish it was more thorough and covered a greater breadth of ages, but I'm not yet finished reading the entire book; maybe, it will surprise me."
3,Very Interesting,"This book is not a bad read if you're wanting help to make sense of things. I was surprised when I began the book that it was written almost forty years ago so it was kind of difficult to put into perspective. There's alot of clinical observation as well that made the book kind of dry in my opinion. The biographical narratives were interesting & insightful however, and I did enjoy reading those."
2,not so amazing,All i have to say is how can u have greatest slow jams and not have the all time no 1 classic while i'm alone on this disc !!!!!!!!!!!! think again please and add this title on an deluxe bonus track edition then u have da classic seeeeeeeeeen
3,I AGREE WITH HOWARD!,What was the creator of this compilation thinking omitting an amazing song like Lady of Magic which is what seduced me into being a lifelong fan of FB & Maze in the first place. Sorry to say that omission will be the reason that I will pass on this CD.
5,execellent!!!!!,I love this CD because I love Frankie Beverly and Maze. I have listen to this CD over and over again. I recommend this to everyone.
4,I Concur with the other two reviewers!,"How can you have a true Maze Slow Jam compilation without ""Lady of Magic!"" Not only that but where is ""Golden Time of Day"" and ""While I'm Alone?"" Those are classic, classic cuts and should be automatically included in any collection! Since some really great songs are missing from this CD, it is really closer to 3.5 stars than 4, but I couldn't bring myself to rate such a beautiful voice and hardworking group any less."
5,King Duvet Cover & King Shams,"It's really beautiful. Duvet cover looks exactly like the picture. Polished cotton. Backing is a navy stripe. Very pleased. Shams are the same pattern but a different material which is slightly darker, but still nice. Backing is the same as the cover."
1,What prophecies?,"As I read this book, I was expecting great insight into the future. Looking at the copyright date of 1940 and comparing the world as it is today, it was obvious his perdiction of the beginning of world peace by March 6, 1947, had not come true. Yet I thought there might be something here worth learning. I would read a chapter or two and think, this is all crazy talk. Put it down and later go back to it. It was like watching a bad movie and keeping with it in hopes that some event near the end would make it all worth sitting through. That didn't happen. The author gives no vivid explanation for the dates he presents for prophesies and in the end there's no proof for his mumblings having any real meaning."
3,A few good songs,I bought this after hearing a song on Pandora that really caught my ear. But I find I don't like the whole CD as much. Nothing here that isn't nice enough though.
3,"OK, not what I expected","After listening to this album, I was quite unimpressed. Nanci Griffith has been a favorite singer of mine since I first heard ""Lonestar State of Mind,"" many years ago. There are some of what I would call ""typical Nanci"" and therefore really good songs - Tecumseh Valley, Boots of Spanish Leather, Spped of the Sound of Loneliness. The rest of the album is OK in that I will listen to the songs on random mode but will rarely, if ever, listen to the album all the way through. There are better Nanci Griffith albums out there."
5,A Very Interesting Book on Some Fascinating Leaders,The Wise Men by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas was a great read. These were six reallyinteresting people that set policy for our country over an extended period of time. I wasinterested in how they interrelated with each other over so many years. The book is hardto put down once you get started. I like reading those kinds of histories. I highlyrecommend this book to anyone interested in the history of this period. There are not many men in our history that had such an affect on our lives. A most enjoyable bookthat brings these six men to life as if you really get to know them. Enjoy areally good history of our time.
1,Book meant for gift had blue permanent marker on pages and bookcover,Very disappointed. Blue marker lines on book make it impossible to gift... returning book for credit does not seem worth the postage or the effort. This kind of experience suggests I should never trust amazon with an important order.
4,Where are the next Wise Men?,"This is ""an excellent read"",, but it left me wondering why we have had no such minds in government in the last 30 years. It made me look back to our national leaders and great minds from the Founding Fathers through the short-lived Kennedy administration. From 1970 on, the bottom has fallen out. We have become late Rome."
2,"Enlightening but certainly not a ""guide"".","While enlightening I feel the title of the book can be misleading. The title should have been ""Making the Case for Simple Organic Living"". Woody gives you countless reasons why simple organic living is a path in life worth taking. The personal anecdotes are very entertaining and eye opening. Unfortunately I was expecting more specific examples of how one begins down the road. Maybe Woody and his team could write a follow up. It would certainly make a great companion book to this one."
4,Nice for the price.,"Be sure to glue all joints when assembling as they tend to losen over time.Other than that, these are very nice!"
5,"Hodges at his peak, in a stellar small band","Collection of small-group sessions Johnny Hodges made during the early 1940s, when Ellington & Co. were red hot and churning out one great song after another. These tracks were remastered from old 78s, but despite a little surface noise it still sounds pretty good. A lot of this stuff isn't found on the usual Ellington Orchestra collections because it was published under Hodges' name. It's good to have it here (and on volume I)."
1,Save your money,"If you can read English, follow a wizard, and have access to the Internet you do NOT need this book. This book simply repeats the information found in Help and in the Wizards. There are no troubleshooting tips on what to do when the Wizard does not work.There is a reason why this book has a used price of $3 soon after it hits the market."
4,Surprising,This is a great CD. It took me by surprise. Imagine Nick Cave backed by the Stooges singing songs of lust and missed sex. It works and it's epic. It's angry and visceral at times but Nick Cave knows how to pull this off without being trite. Bowie returned to the roots of rock n'roll with Tin Machine and now it's Cave. I hope they tour.
2,Two weeks review,I havent seen any change. It doesnt have an orange smell. I didnt like it so far but I will update my review once I see a change
2,Disappointing for the price,"You see on Amazone the tracks, but no one tells you they total 20 minutes or so, with additonal video stuff that's silly."
1,Don't put your baby on this,"Shelves are paper thin, they would not hold anything beyond a small 6 oz bottle of shampoo. Support area for the baby is too flimsy, we were afraid to put the baby there. The actual changing pad that comes with it is very thin, less than 0.5"" thick, but the shape of it does not lend itself well to adding another pad. We returned this changing table. We did not feel it was worth the risk. I am a second-time mom and have a lot of experience with changing tables. It is worth it to spend more and get a quality piece of furniture."
4,Changing Table,"Good changing table, it's perfect for our baby. Packaging was damaged when received and table was a little scratched on the side but ok!Good product for the price!"
4,The opportunities and madness of post-war Germany,"This is a long book, but worthwhile. One gains an appreciation of the opportunities for rebirth and renewal from personal and national perspectives, offered in post-war Germany. At the same time, the seedier side of life in a devastated state is succintly described.It has certainly been one of my more memorable reads in the past few years, and I would read his next book without hesitation."
4,Reese Front Mount Skid Plug,Does the job. Didn't fit real tight and rattled...so I ran some black duct tape around the post and now it doesn't make any noise. Good deal.
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to add some Ed Bickert to my collection and get a good idea of what a good guitar player does when playing along with a big band. But you can only head Ed's guitar on one track. The solo he plays isn't all that good. Overall, most of the music is is passable. There are a couple of good standards on here. I just wish Ed Bickert's guitar was louder in the mix."
3,Children are Angels,"Walter Dean Myers has put together a unique collection of poetry highlighting AfricanAmerican childhood. Instead of using traditional illustrations, Myers gathered acollection of turn of the century photographs of African American children in placesranging from flea markets to museums. Each of the poems seems to capture the veryessence of the corresponding photograph and bring life to the nameless faces within the pictures. I enjoyed all of the poems in this collection, my personal favorites were ""Love that Boy"" and ""Pretty Little Black Girl"" which were tributes to Black boys and girls respectively.While I enjoyed this collection, I believe this is a book that will be enjoyed more by parents than by their children. Still this book is a wonderful tribute to ordinary African American children and our rich cultural heritage. The stunning photographs along with delightful poems make this book worth checking out.Reviewed by Stacey SeayThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,"It's Wonderful, Adorable, and Heart Warming",It's a wonderful make you feel good book. A great gift idea for all ages. The photos are beautiful and heart warming. I have given this book as a gift many times and everyone adores it.
5,A delightful book!,"This a delightful book; wonderful to browse and beautifully laid out by the publisher to convey the turn-of-the-century feel. I love looking at these children, and wonder how their life unfolded."
1,Why No Color Photos for the Kindle PC?,"I realize that the Kindle does not currently (as of August, 2011) accomodate color photos, but the Kindle for PC version does. I have previously bought five other art books from the Oxford series, and they are all beautifully presented on the PC. This is the first one that is totally in black and white (except for the cover.) Not only that, but the photos are dark and difficult to see. I hope that this was a mistake that Oxford will soon rectify. Until then, I give the book only 1 star; otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Some good ideas but be careful in following advice,"There is two useful ideas in the book: not giving out references until there is an actual job offer and how to handle salary negotiations. Other than that, the Personal Sales Letter is just a cover letter (Read ""The Overnight Job Change Letter"" for a better way to write cover letters) and targeting the decision maker comes straight out of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"". His chapter on telephoning for a job suggests some sneaky ways to get to the hiring authority that in reality, would turn most bosses off. Basically, there is nothing really new in this book that hasn't been covered in other job hunting books and, in my experience, refusing to send in a resume until after the interview is just not viable in most cases."
2,Heeeheeehee,"We watched this film with my cousin... we had loads of fun but the film is like retarded, but we didn't care. I wouldn't buy the dvd by its-self though, the dolls are wicked. I especially like the redhead one... I can't remember her name, it began with a 'K'. Oh well, anyway, not chelsea.wicked film... though buy it with the doll."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"The title of this book is misleading in that it causes the reader to believe that it is aimed at 'pagans' and is a 'complete guide to incantations, spells and recipes and lore"". The 'lore' is at many times innacurate, to say the least; there are only one or two token food 'recipes' to speak of (and those for historical, not nutrional value); the spells and incantations are geared towards wiccans, with a flair for the dramatic and no historical context whatsoever provided. As a laymen's introduction to halloween this book is harmless, and would most probably appeal only to curious non-pagans as a novelty."
4,Why Not the Pagan Book of Samhain?,"I do question WHY it isn't The Pagan Book of Samhain, but I presume she has her reasonsI did though really enjoyed this little book. You can expect to find the following...Origin of Halloween and Lore, Rituals and Celebrations, Herbs and Omens, Symbols, Superstions, Halloween Divinations, Recipes, and a Pagan Perspective, and more.I find anything on Samhain delightful and interesting, a very nice additon to my Ravenwolf book.I love her choice of covers, using a John Wm Waterhouse painting once again. She has a nice thorough Bibliography which I love to scan for more sources for my own library.Not a bad investment"
4,Love Halloween,Halloween is my favorite holliday and I found this book to be interesting and enjoyed the different way to do the rituals that I hold dear.
3,Decient but lacking in many fundamental ways,"While this book is a good book for use and the general knowledge, I personally found it lacking upon very basic ideals. It spend by far too much time exploring the ways to exploit our ways, and not enough on the far reaching implications of them (ie. a butterfly flaps it's wings in bejing and in central park you get rain instead of sun). While reading this book, one must have at least a basic understanding of the concept ""Whatever one does, it affects everyone."" Otherwise, a good reference."
2,Great at first but.............,"Bought a pair of these a year and a half ago, but was spending lots of time on the water then. Seems that the plastic is not very UV resistant since they would grip a hook and not flex at first. After a year I had some problems removing hooks from fish, but within a few more months the hook was always coming out of the jaws(of the pliers, not the fish).Saw someone recently on my local fishing forum say that he bought some for use for cutting braided line only, and I told him he should have saved his money and bought the same pair of scissors for 4.99 that I bought from the sporting goods department at wally world 4 years ago and am still using for that.Save your money, get braided line scissors, and/or maybe a Gerber 600 and take care of them."
2,Clips are too flimsy,I bought this holder to use with my Dell Axim X5 and pharos GPS as I travel. The clips included (used to hold the holder to the vent) are VERY flimsy. All three included have snapped within 6 months.I left the main body of the thing in a rental car when the last clip snapped and placed an order for the holder with the suction cup. Well worth the extra $10.
3,Ok for the price,"The video is an overall good workout which can easily be done at home. I like the cardio sections, and the weight portion is decent if you use more weights than Gilad is using.I was surprised that no one caught the errors during the editing process for the DVD. He forgets to complete two of the exercises on the opposite leg during the #2 workout. I just paused and did it myself, but I wonder why they used those clips for the DVD when clearly there were mistakes."
4,Gilad total body sculpt,I thought this was a good workout Alot of static moves which were a little more challenging but I like it. worth what I paid for it.
2,Gilad Total Bdy Sculpt Plus: Peak Performance with Gilad,Was looking forward for this and found the quality of the dvd to be poor. It is OK for around 15 minutes of it and then it starts to freeze and the picture shakes. It would start again and less then 30 seconds the problem was back. I was trying to get my husband to do a workout with me and found this one. I didn't return because I had thrown away all the return labels. I have emailed Amazon and have not received any response.
5,"Awesome, fun","I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get healthy, reform your muscles and build strength while you burn fat."
2,"Cute idea, nice sense of humor, but falls flat","Ophelia learns to swim is many things, it's a feminist comedy (not necessary a contradiction in terms), a superhero parody and a coming of age story. It's also an ultra low budget film with some talented performers.Ophelia is an ordinary girl taken for granted by her family and her boyfriend. Then she's kidnapped by the Broom Witch and the Council of Superheroines. She takes on their antifeminist foes including the smoking villainess Virginia Svelte.There's a lot of sincerity in the film, the Superheroines are always making speeches about women's oppression and social issues. There's also a bit of parody, the film is not afraid to make fun of its issues but the jokes fall flat, the low budget is apparent and really it's not very entertaining.There's potential. Julia Lee and Lauren Birkell in particular put in good performances, but in the end there's really no reason to seek this movie out."
5,daughter in law loved them,I purchased 2 of these seat covers for my daughter in law and she loved them. they fit her vehicle seat perfectly.
3,"Slow cold start, outdated maps, missing output connector","in the original shipment package...Otherwise, it's an amazing device. Very easy to set-up, and get going. I am returning mine because the package did not come with the power output connector for the cigarette adapter. 40 Mb left in the memory barely fits the DC metro area, and you can go much further if your pocketpc has secure digital memory slot in addition to compactflash.My 3.5 yr old house can't be mapped because the street does not appear on the latest map I downloaded from pharosgps site. I was curious to try this, and I think it is a nice $200 toy."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have read several books on ADD and found this book to be full of the same old falacies and myths about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback as all the rest, and none of it works! It was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother!The most helpful book that I have read is The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D."
2,Disappointing...,"This is a lesson that just because you see something on Dr Phil, doesn't mean its good.I was disappointed with the lack of practical strategies suggested. It was not revolutionary as the hype made it out to be.I have read MANY books on the subject and would not recommend this to someone looking for help with their child. Save your money!"
2,Teach your kid how to speak with a speech impediment,My 3 year old daughter loves the show but the show creators thought a character with a speech impediment was cute. There are more entertaining shows that actually teach you child skills that are a better alternative. Team Umizoomi is great for math. Word World and the Leap Frog series teach reading. I would rate this 1 star but my daughter likes the show.
3,Wonder Pets Save the Dolphin!/Save the Chimp!,"Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire for my great niece,age 3. She enjoyed the story and characters. Very cute, would have been better if the little duck would have spoke with clearer speech."
5,GAMEBREAKER 2004 IS THE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME EVER,THIS GAME BLOWS EA SPORTS NCAA FOOTBALL 2010 AWAY IT HAS BETTER GRAPHICS BETER GAMEPLAY BETTER GAME MODES IT HAS CREATE YOUR OWN TEAM THATS BETTER THAN EA SPORTS YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AND REARANGE YOUR CONFERENCE SCHEDULE THIS GAME IS SO REALISTIC I WOULD RECOMEND THAT YOU BUY IT EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE NEW LAME VERSION OF EA SPORTS NCAA FOOTBALL 10
1,Hat came apart at the seams.,My son had to have a hat for his school play. I got this hat and he wore it one day for about an hour altogher and it came apart at the seams. Not sewn good. Was not happy with the product at all.
3,A good quality hat for it's price.,I got this hat for my daughter's book review project. It is the best price that I can find. The quality is better than I expected after reading some of the reviews. I am happy with the product. It serves my purpose.
3,Encyclopedia Britanica software,"Very easy to use, useful product, takes a long time to fully install, does not list all information, as encyclopedia. Some of the simplest items that should be listed are not. Software needs a Codec to operate which is not on the disk, should be included, have to down load codec from Apple Software and the manually place it witin the corect foder on harddrive in order to access the videos, onsoftware. This is a real downside."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this expecting a large database of information. My 1978 encyclopedia collection has more information than this! Not to mention they expect you to pay if you want all of the features. I personally found this to be very disappointing!
3,Probably better than you expect,"Solid genre thriller from Italy is not nearly as exploitive as the title and box art suggest, though sex & violence isn't exactly at a minimum. Think American slasher movie merged with an Italian art film and you'll have some idea of what's in store. The DVD features a clean widescreen print and an English dubbing job that's actually fairly polished."
3,Too restrained,"The musical score is the best part of Strip Nude For Your Killer, because I've been humming it ever since I watched this DVD. The title implies that there will be two things in the movie: 1) Killing and 2) Nudity. There are both, but neither are used with much flair. Viewers that enjoy wild displays of violence and gore will likely be disappointed, but those who are into watching naked women walk around in high heels may be pleased. As a mystery, it's pretty dull. As a sleazefest, it's not sleazy enough. The movie really does the title and the soundtrack a disservice."
1,tie,"Although I rated this tie a 1 star, it wasn't because it wasn't a nice tie or good quality. I ordered it thinking it was a boys tie as in NOT TODDLER! It was a toddler tie! We didn't end up using it. It would have cost more to send back then it cost!!!"
2,Not worth the price,This phone is not worth the money for the features being offered. You are better off considering the MPx200 which syncs well with Outlook(something this doesnt do)and has complete integration with Exchange. Also this is bigger than the MPx200 and so not as easy to carry with you.
3,frustration with the Treo 600,"The phone is cool, but wait until they get more of the kinks out. I love the capability of the Treo 600 (although the camera is so crappy it's a waste of weight.) However, the treo 600 got initially had a defective battery and so wouldn't hold a charge. The replacement treo was great but after a week the speaker stopped working so the phone only worked in speakerphone mode. The customer support was easy to navigate and fast to send a replacement treo. The only problem is the speaker of the replacement treo (my third at this point) doesn't work at all --in or out of speakerphone mode. Now the customer support folks are just frustrating and unable to escalate my case to make sure I get a working Treo. Furthermore, they have no way to credit the monthly fee I'm paying for cell phone service and can't really use (unless I want to make all my calls in speakerphone mode.)"
4,Great product but has some shortfalls,"My goal was to eliminate having a cell phone, PDA and Blackberry via a Smartphone. The TREO 600 was the answer but has limitations. It requires a fairly complicated setup and third party software to access corporate e-mail. AT@T also has additional software and monthly fees (which was a surprise during setup) over the e-mail and memory fees upon purchase. If you are an Outlook user, third party software i.e. DatavViz is a must. BTW, I spent about $200 on third party software and believe I need to spend another ~$300 for SD memory. Web access is slow but tolerable. I found the screen to be very small for meeting and e-mail details but that's the price one pays for a small foot print. Overall, I rated it high because of all the features--may take some time to fully replace my IPAQ."
1,The biggest POS,"I've had my Treo(s) for almost exactly one month and have had nothing but issues from day one. Random resets, calls dropping or not coming through at all, major echo heard by incoming callers (led to the return of Treo #1) and finally unable to hear anything unless on speakerphone or using headset (led to my final return of Treo #2). All of these problems have been experienced by 3 other of my Treo-using friends. The worst way to spend $600+, IMHO. Cool concept, poor execution. I'm going back to 2 devices."
4,Best PDA/Phone yet,"While a PDA/Phone is not the thing for everyone, the Treo 600 comes closer than anything on the market. It is small enough to be held in one hand and the keyboard is usable, though only for short bursts, with one or both thumbs.The full-featured PalmOS device gives you access to all phone numbers and email addresses in all built-in programs (no more limit of 20 or 50 or 100 like many phone only models.Its camera will not be used for too many vacation photos. But, it is ideal for field work (real estate, client visits, etc.) because you can snap and send photos and then upload them easily to your PC.The MP3 player (free with registration) is adequate, though I prefer my iPod for that. The reason is that the headset jack is poorly located on the bottom of the unit and requires an adapter (sold separately!) to use standard headphones.The only other complaint of note is that there is not a way to add Bluetooth, WiFi or other alternative connections to the device."
4,"Jack of all trades, master of none.","Overall I am pleased with my Treo. The combination of features is very convenient. I like the fact that I can talk on the phone and look up a number from my contacts list, call a second person with the press of a button, and schedule a meeting on my calendar, all in the same conversation with one device.It falls short on the camera function, however. I have found little use for the photos because they are of such poor quality. They are dark and grainy.I also find the sound quality from the earpiece provided with the phone is poor.The overall convenience more than makes up for the few shortcomings."
1,Dropped Calls galore,"I had another combo phone, the Kyocera 6035, a bit bulky but worked fine. I bough this and have constant dropped calls, no service, etc.Very displeased with this phone."
2,MAJOR FLAW in this device - beware,"I just got this phone and it's really slick but there is one very significant design flaw in the Treo 600 that will cost you a ton of money -- BEWARE.It seems if you are on a call and your call-waiting goes off, there is no way to hang up on the first call and switch to the second. You can ONLY HANG UP ON BOTH CALLS! So what happens is if you tell one person you'll get back with them and then flip over to the other call BOTH CALLS CONTINUE TO RACK UP AIR TIME, regardless of whether the other person has hung up!This is a huge design flaw, or maybe it's intentional so you wipe out all your minutes. Whatever the case, I can't figure out how to deal with it except if you have call waiting, you shouldn't answer it, or you should answer both, hang up on both, then call who you want to talk to. This is RIDICULOUS!! BEWARE."
2,New purchase,"I recently bought the Treo 600 instead of the 650 because of the price difference. I have to say that I am surprised that the speakerphone volume is so low and with so much distortion to the listener.Also, the process of setting up synching your email is a difficult task that is not easily explained in the manual.My recommendation is that the phone has great features that don't work so well. If there is a return policy, use it diligently for that time so you can make an informed decision regarding returning it."
2,Unreliable PDA phone,"I am now on my THIRD Treo 600. The first two were replaced because the phone would turn itself off and back on again, go out of service when calls were being made or received, and losing my programmed data. My third treo is only a week old and is dropping calls constantly. I have been happy with the phone when it works, but, reliability is a serious problem. Verizon Wireless has been no help either other than in replacing the phone under warranty which takes no less than 2 hours of my time and two days to ship. Battery life is less than expected and I'm usually recharging the phone by late afternoon. Another annoying feature is the low battery warning that must be cleared from the screen if you're trying to dial in codes to check voice mail or other dtmf services. It will interrupt you every 10 seconds. Also, the person on the other end can hear your low battery tones, voice mail notifications, etc. Annoying."
1,Sprint PCS- Bad,Buyer beware... do not buy Sprint. I give them zero stars! I purchased a Treo 600 for metro Atlanta. Basically the service was very bad. I called to cancelled and charged me $112 and change. As a business customer or any customer why am I being changed for poor service. I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried. But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer. If you intend to buy a phone from them get the least expensive plan first. Then will not loose as much monsy as I did for just 7 days of service.
1,Sprint's Service,"I bought my Treo from a Sprint store. The sales rep messed up when setting up my plan, Sprint then refunded me the extra charges I was paying, but added me to some additional plan without my knowledge. I've tried to have them set up my phone as advertised in the store and their response is it isn't their problem that their employee messed up, so they want me to pay $15 extra a month. Avoid Sprint."
3,What the Treo 600 is lacking,"What is this.....NO CLOCK?!?! I am almost ready to purchase a 600 and have read that there is no clock. Even my old Palm IIIc has a clock. And no call timer?!?!? Even the cheapest cells have timers. I have not yet determined if the phone will ring and vibrate at the same time, but I expect it will not based on the selector switch on the top."
1,Great Design -- software lagging WAY behind Pocket PC,"I love the design of this phone. Unfortunately asthetics will only get you so far. Overall, this is a bust. The signal is greatly improved over the previous PocketPC Phone Edition, but the Palm OS 5 just falls WAY SHORT. If you have ever used a Pocket PC device, do not buy this phone. One thing after another keeps poping up. Things you just take for granted. Imagine that you have used MS Windows all your life and you switch to something that seems to look better. All the sudden, you can't view your files without a third party app, you can't transfer your files to a disk without a third party app. You have to jump through hoops to check your email or print and even then it's not reliable. Wouldn't that be awefull? I'm telling you, this Treo 600 phone is a BOMB! Looks great but a BOMB. It's light too... a light BOMB. It's cute and light not even heavy enough to make a good doorstop which would be it's best use."
4,Everything is excellent except the Camera,"I recently purchased Hand spring Treo 600 and had been very pleased with all the features offered. I have since made full use of the emails, web search and all the add ons programs. However when come to taking pictures, I was very disappointed that it is not clear, it is hazy and not sharp and needs very bright light to be visible. Would the manufacturer please comment and how to improve the viewing and picture taking. Is this due to the .3 Mega pixel resolution and can this be upgraded?Does some one else experience the same thing as me. I tried other G3 phones and the pictures are much clearer than the Treo 600."
5,Novice really likes it,I had not used a cell phone much before I purchased this. It is quickly learned and logically made. The internet use is incredible. I cannot imagine this phone being improved soon. The price on amazon.com is amazing. I could not be more satisfied with this product.Bruce Hines
1,Sound Is An Important Feature For A Phone,"If I had written this review shortly after the purchase of my phone, it would have been filled with accolades. This phone is fantastic...until it breaks. Several years ago, I purchased the Treo 600 palm phone with Sprint coverage. Within one year, the sound stopped working. I was given a refurbished phone, which eventually came to the same end. So, now on my third phone, the sound is again causing problems. Of course, this one fell apart a year and a week after the last one was replaced so Sprint refuses to replace it.If you check out the reviews on ZDNet.com, you will notice that I am not alone in this complaint. Of course, the situation is a combination of poor design from PalmOne and poor business practices from Sprint. I would not recommend either company to anyone."
2,Bought to Replace Tungsten W- Big Mistake,"Got Tungsten W because of Palm OS- good concept bad execution- horrible phone because it always required the headset.Thought PalmOne Treo 600 was the answer. Camera a joke- can't see any detail. Browser is useless because of screen size. Phone & Palm Dayplanner works fine -but so what. For the money I should have gotten a blackberry... The Treo is a big step forward- but NOT far enough. Must improve- camera, screen size , and must add bluetooth."
1,"No voice activated dialing, no voice memo","Would you pay [money] for a phone that does not havevoice activated dialing and no voice memo ?This phone is a perfect case study of flawed designof engineering. So many things are in this devicewith low quality, while features which are reallyimportant and used every time do notexist."
2,Fragile,"Features are great camera sucks blah blah. Let me get to the point.I've had several cell phones in my life. Never once has one of them stopped working. Since I got this particular phone 6 months ago, it has simply stopped working not once, but twice. Two times I've had to replace the phone with a brand new unit. Two times I've lost all of my phone numbers and software.So why did the phone stop working? Not because I dropped it. Not because I mishandled it or downloaded bad software. No, it was because (as far as I can tell) I switched to the phone mode too fast after typing a text message. That's it. Really. The phone just froze up and that was that.With all the hassle I've gone through with this unit, I definitely cannot recommend it. If it had only happened once, okay, it's a fluke. But twice? For this kind of money, I would beware folks."
4,Multi-Tasking Treo 600,"I've been using the Treo 600 for a couple of months now and do enjoy its multiple personalities. As a PDA, the bright screen overcomes its somewhat narrow format, and all of the functions seem to be well-integrated.As a phone, the Treo 600 works as well as my previous model and I prefer the mini-brick format to a folding phone. Voice quality seems good, and adjusting the volume can be done one-handed.The expansion slot is wonderful for add-on cards. The built-in camera is not ready for prime time and could've been eliminated.More valuable might have been a voice memo feature, although you can call yourself and leave a voice mail.I've found a clip-on belt holster for the Treo that works well, but would've been more secure with a loop instead of a clip."
1,silly and boring,"The story of this Anime is so contrived that you are just beginning to try and figure it out around the 50 minute mark. The only problem is - it's over 2 seconds later!!!Save yourself the (almost) hour, and skip this boring excuse for a movie."
1,Wrong Year,"ATTENTION: At the present time, the technical details listed for this item are incorrect! The manufacturer's product number AAGSK240008 is for a 2008 calendar. Apparently, the last 2 digits denote the year, so I should have ordered product number AAGSK240009 (ASIN: B001C82GQK). I ordered a calendar from this page and received a 2008 calendar. Unless you actually want a 2008 calendar, find the page for the 2009 At A Glance Desk Pad (ASIN: B001C82GQK) and order from there. Just search for AAGSK240009 and you'll find it. By the way, I've notified Amazon about this error, so the listing may have been corrected by the time you read this. By the way, my 1 star review isn't a reflection of the quality of the product itself. These are great calendars and probably deserve at least 4 stars. On the other hand, a 2008 calendar is pretty useless in the year of 2009!"
3,Needs a little something more,"Most of these recipes are not the versions that your grandmother made. Some of them are things that your mama never would've thought about cooking. A lot of them are the quickie or new versions. You may want to consider the Ebony Cookbook or Slyvia's or the grand dame of black heritage cookbooks, Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine."
5,A RONNIE EARL PRODUCTION!,"ORIGINALLY RECORDED IN 1988, THIS CD WAS PRODUCED BY RONNIE EARL WHO JOINS CAMPBELL ON ""SITTIN' HERE THINKIN'"" AND ""SUNNYLAND TRAIN"" AND AGAIN WITH THE BROADCASTERS AT THAT TIME (PORTNOY, HANSON AND NULISCH) ON ""JUDGMENT DAY"" AND ""TEXAS COUNTRY BOY"". THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS CD CONTAINED AN ADDITIONAL SONG ""DOWN IN THE BOTTOM"" WHICH, FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, HAS BEEN DROPPED ON THIS 1994 RELEASE. NEVERTHELESS, JOHN CAMPBELL'S HOPKIN STYLE GUITAR PLAYING AND VOCALS ARE IN TOP FORM. LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS ""BLUEBIRD"" SOUNDS AS FRESH ON THIS CD AS THE DAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY RECORDED. IF YOU LIKE ACOUSTIC TEXAS BLUES ALA LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS FINE CD."
5,"Yellowman Rides, Again!!","For me, yellowman rides again is the ultimate dancehall album. It was the very first reggae album I listened to as a kid in Africa way back then, I remember rinsin' the tape all day for weeks! and it still sounds great today.Hail the King Yelloman!"
3,"Tatums smoke mild, like an innocent child . . .","Max Shulman skewers the unholy alliance that existed between the television and tobacco industries during the mid 1960's and, as if that weren't enough, paints it all against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and desegregation in the South. Oh and of course there's a healthy ration of hilarious sex for all involved. I wouldn't call this Shulman's best novel. I'd reserve that praise for ""Rally Round The Flag Boys"" or ""Potatoes Are Cheaper"".But ""Anyone Got A Match"" is still a great read after you've finished the others."
3,Better as a fond memory,"I first read this book when I was a teenager (about the time Gutenberg invented the printing press) and thought it was one of the funniest things I had ever read. Having such fond memories of this book, I sought out a used copy here on Amazon and looked forward to getting reacquainted with an old friend. Well, sometimes we discover we no longer have as much in common with old friends as we thought. Maybe it's just that times have changed and the story and humor are too dated, or that my youthful funny bone was more ticklish back then, but I found upon re-reading this book that is was more of a chuckler than a laugh riot. Anyone who has enjoyed other Max Shulman novels and short stories should also get a kick out of this, but it's a book of its time and unlikely to appeal to today's readers."
4,Suede fever,"Suede are an attitude-driven, neo-rock outfit. They gained a lot of success in the 90's with their snappy melodies and the lead singer's distinct vocals. Their biggest hits are the tasty `The Beautiful Ones' and the shrewdly put-together `Trash.' But they also have other distinct tracks like `Filmstar' and the awkwardly exciting `She's In Fashion.'Their recent material, like the lacking `Positivity,' are less-listenable than their previous victories. However, this collection chronicles the many dives and turns Britrock was taking to find its identity. Recommended only to people who have an appreciation for anti-grunge rock fans and admirers."
3,Jean Gau was a character,"Not really written by Gau. Mostly was put together by the editors. Not much of a sea tale, very few details of the time spent voyaging. He really didn't seem to be a very good seaman, just an incurable romantic with big dreams. But then, he wasn't a pro like Slocum, and so we shouldn't expect to learn ""how to"" from Jean Gau, but rather, more how NOT to do it!"
4,It is! Indeed it's Romantic-Comedy!,"The first thing you need to realize, is that the book isn't a novel, at all. It's a screenplay. Probably written for a (slightly) younger Juliette Binoche.Once you accept that, you can cast it at will and have a marvelous time...at least 'til the real movie comes out and destroys your illusions."
3,Wasn't Very Romantic to me!,"I thought this book was okay- not the best I have ever read, but not the worst either.It reminded me alot of Northern Exposure for some reason, andthe end reminded me of an old movie with the characters all chasing each other in and out of all the doors.The idea was cute, and I would have liked to have seen moredepth in the plot and the characters.Ellen"
2,Not very romantic,"Nathalie leaves France with her fiance, Pierre, for an American vacation. They take a bus ""see America"" but get stranded in Seldom, NE. Both stay at seperate places because the boardinghouse is ladies only. Couple fight and quarrel - question their upcoming marriage. Weak plot and I find it very boring.I had to force myself to finish this book."
2,What to do when your screenplay is rejected?,"Release it as a novel. ""Isn't it Romantic"" is a tossed-off collection of cliches and stereotypes, made even more disappointing by the comic potential that bubbles below the turgid dialogue. Why make the effort, Hansen apparently felt, to create realistic characters when Billy Bob Thornton and Liv Tyler can provide all the accent and color that the writing lacks?"
2,One of the worst books I have read in a very long time,"I found this novel to be nothing more than loosely thrown together characters immersed in a weak and scattered plot. The only character I could even remotely identify with was Pierre, and this was only because he was dropped into the middle of Nebraska, not really understanding what was going on around him - exactly the way I felt throughout most of this book. This story has no soul, no heart, and isn't worth the few hours it takes to wade through it."
1,Isn't it Terrible,Completely unfunny and geared for people without any intelligence or desire to educate oneself (see the always-translated French in parentheses). Is this book funny? Non (no). Is it silly? Oui. (yes).
3,"Laugh-out-loud funny, but a conventional finale","I laughed out loud at the characters, dialogue and unlikely situations in this delightful book, but was disappointed in a perfunctory, conventional ending. Toward the end, the writing descends into a staccatto, scripty patter that makes one think the author has a screen treatment in mind. Not a bad idea. Nonetheless, it's a quick, delightful read and recommended. All the more funny if you're French, from Nebraska, or both. The character Owen is a complete scream -- my favorite."
4,Charming,"Mr. Hansen usually gives us books with a bit more texture to the story, but I cannot complain about that since this book is utterly charming. It is a sweet, romantic story about a young French pair who, while working out their relationship, and on a bus tour of the US (the kind that takes you to see the home of the Maytag washer), end up in a lovely little town of nice, tho eccentric Americans. Sound hokey? It doesn't matter. This book will bring a huge smile to your face and make you want to sing."
3,"Sonic assaults, post rock, folk, and pyschadelic rock","'The Wedding' tries to make sense of several musical styles, falling somewhere in between post-rock and the droning psych-rock of The Bevis Frond or early Mercury Rev, assimilating elements of both the Farfisa organ and orchestral strings. At it's most reflective, this album touches on acoustic folk, strings, mellow organs, and quirky Krautrock experimentation. At it's most intense, the sound is swirly and mystical, sonic guitar assaults, psychadelic period Floyd meets the canned thumping rhythms of Tortoise. The closest description I can come up with (without going into mix and match overkill) is an obscure band called Black Sun Ensemble. If that doesn't work for you, try The Flaming Lips meets Spacemen 3, occasionally dabbling in avant-garde orchestral rock."
4,Oneida - The Wedding,"This is basically a fantastic record marred by really half-assed singing. You guys sound out of breath - get in shape!Otherwise, always sonically interesting, varied, fits very much within the current wave of NYC indie-psych and post-punk stuff -- in fact Oneida seems to be very much an amalgam of several of the ""hip"" styles right now, but in the best way possible. Just wish the singing could match the band."
3,stenciling,"A beautifull written book for the craft person who want to do 'dry' stenciling..acomplish great results with many different stencils for cards, scrapbooking, etc. Pretty pictures and easy to follow instructions."
1,Buyer beware!,"The first pan that came from Amazon had a defect in the enamel, a white splotch on one of the handles. I requested a replacement and the next one that came was damaged in the same manner. They are functionally ok, but perhaps they are factory seconds."
3,Buy if you use it only within US,"I don't know why panasonic cannot add automatic voltage conversion ($10 feature) in a medium-to-high level shaver. Remington has it in most models, while panasonic has only very few models supporting it.If you travel internationally, you need to buy a remington converter (mostly bought by panasonic customers)."
2,Not correct speed fan control.,"The the fan speed control is made using voltage changes because the device doesn't have PMW.The fans working 100 percent always, doesn't matter the temperature.But the design is wonderful"
4,Almost.....,"Not exactly what I expected. Doesn't actually tell the rpm of the fans, and doesn't have many adjustment features."
1,Impossibly hard to turn crank on wheat,"Must be taken apart and cleaned after every use according to instructions. That alone makes it inconvenient.Next to impossible to turn crank on hard winter wheat grains in order to get the flour fine enough to not crack your teeth on. Unless you plan to make large grain wheat ""mush"" cereal, get an electric mill. This doesnt work for milling baking flours."
3,It does a good job in many cases buuuuuutttt!,While it does a good job in many cases it has problems.problems:1 the clamp does not work on many kitchen counters. I either have to use it in the garage or use boards to allow it to clip to the counter.2 Most if not all of this mill is cast metal. Some parts have some metal milling that is done after the plating process meaning some surfaces have no protection from rust. Also the parts have quality issues as in being uniform. It makes it clunky.3 hard to make good adjustments.4 last but not least in the problems. I could not get the #$%^ thing to grind almonds fine enough to use for flour. I have to us my small electric coffee/spice grinder for the final grind. I expected I'd have to make 2 or more grinds to get fine on some grains or seeds but no amount of grinding passes worked.The positives:1 parts are readily available by mail order.2 it has a good price not great but good.
5,My 6 year old loves these games,My 6 year old son loves to play all 4 games included in the pack. He plays multiple times and the villan is usually someone different each time he plays. I highly recommend this product.
5,Excellent resource in Indian law,"This is an excellent resource in federal Indian law. It is updated annually via cumulative pocket-parts and is a thorough review of the subject. It is a great place to begin research in Indian law because it lays out the blackletter and has copious citations to the major (and sometimes less major) cases on the subject. For me, if I could have only one book on the subject, this would be it."
2,Not impressed,"I was unable to read this book past her premise- make sure there is alliteration in your baby's name. What? I don't think that alliteration is necessary to make a nice sounding name, Whitney Walker! I guess it is nice to be memorable but frankly, I am more concerned about the cadence of a name (and how it flows with the last name) and the ""feel"" of a name than alliteration. Scrap this book and try The Baby Name Wizard by Laura Wattenberg first."
4,Something to think about,"Although we didn't end up choosing a name directly from the book, the book helped point out a few things to think about while selecting a name. It gave great lists of names for specific sounds that we might have been going for. I thought it was useful, and we bought it for naming our second child which was definitely harder for us."
2,didn't like the list divisions,"Whether or not this book does you any good will depend on the what you're looking for. If you have a specific number of syllables you're looking for and know where you want the accents to go, this would be great for you, since that how teh sections are divided. If, like me, you want to look through long alphabetical lists or through groups of names that fit a certain topic, you're out of luck here.I found the set-up irritating. If I wanted a girl's name starting with 'S', I had to hunt through pages and scan too many listings. They do include some really nice modern names, I just didn't like find it useful as is."
3,Not quite what I expected,This book was good...in that I understood her point. Some names just roll off your tongue and others you stumble over. But I found the endless lists hard to follow after a while. I guess I was expecting a more detailed formula and not just sounding out my own last name.
4,Why full price for a half season?,Odd that the networks have been hosing us with a bunch of half season box sets for full price. Thank the writers.Pretty shameful.Great series.
2,Wasted Potential,This series is made up of lots of fine actors who are wasted acting out puerile practical jokes on one another and behaving in a generally childish and unprofessional manner. At times it is quite clear that even they don't believe what they are required to say. Why can't the scriptwriters show a bit of maturity; and where is the sea and the ships?
5,Our Favorite,All of the NCIS shows are our favorite; just about all the entertainment we watch on TV
5,Seasons 1 through 5,"This is one of the best written Television shows since Magnum PI. I loved it when Cait asked Gibbs what Ducky used to look like when he was younger and Gibbs told her he looked like Iylela Kuriakian (Sorry not sure of the correct spelling), (The Man for U.N.C.L.E.). Abby's character is awesome, and fits the part perfect as do all of them. Donald Bellasario is an awesome writer, wish I could write the he does. It is so much fun to try and figure out what all the acronyms mean, since I was never in the service. Really looking for season 6 to come out on DVD and Season 7 on Television.I highly recommend this show to anyone that loves to figure out the mystery of how the person was killed.Sorry, don't really see the connection of Tony and Ziva. Tony was and will be a big flirt. He did the same with Caitlyn.I hope that more people will start watching the show, it is really worth it!!"
5,NCIS 5th season,"NCIS is the most entertaining cop,investigating,forensic,and anything else that relates to it, show on tv. Its funny, serious, dramatic, absolutely a joy to watch. I don't miss a show."
3,Disappointed,"I have the previous 4 seasons of NCIS. NCIS is the best show on TV IMO. The 5th season was great. Why have I only given 3 stars to my review? I ordered the 5th season from Amazon and what I got was one disk was full screen and the remaining disks were widescreen. When I returned them, Amazon sent me a replacement and the same thing happened, but it was a different disk that was full screen. IMO, Amazon has been better than any other supplier of CD's, DVD's, and books with their return and refund policies, so I assume its the manufacturers. I will eventually purchase it again and by that time, maybe they will have straightened out the problem. But you just can't beat the characters of Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Tony D., Ziva, McGee, Ducky, and especially Abby of any show that's on right now. There is more depth, humor, and love in NCIS than I've seen in any other show in my lifetime."
5,A Favorite Season!,This is one of my favorite seasons to date as so many story lines are resolved and the season is brought to a crescendo in a two part season finale! More is revealed about Gibbs past in this season as one of his ex-wives is involved in a case the team must solve and one of his murdered daughter childhood friends needs Gibbs help. Abby makes a shocking discovery when a troupe of boy scouts tour her lab. Ziva is undercover trying to catch a serial killer. Abby saves a K-9 believed to have murdered his master. Tony reveals his true identity to Jeanne. La Grenouille is brought to justice and in the season finale of the series main characters is killed.
5,Way to Go!,Once again the witty banter and variety of conmplex cases continue to entertain. I like the mix of personalities and on going relationships.
4,Good,"Reasonably priced compared to buying it in one of the ""box stores"", especially since I cannot currently find it in any of the box stores."
3,Decent,I can tolerate the copy I got but there were some problems. The first disc was not watchable. It kept skipping and audio was skipping too. I ended up giving up on the first disc. Starting on the second disc it wasn't skipping and the audio was perfect but it ended up having subtitles for some reason.
5,Love It!!,I love this show and walmart took all the seasons off the shelf while I was at season 4. Luckily for me I came on Amazon and found it with ease it was at door in a couple days AMAZON STRIKES AGAIN!
3,Not all episodes would play on my DVD player,"This is one of the two sets of NCIS dvd I bought that had episodes that would not play on my dvd player. I bought six sets in all within a period of about four or five months. I wrote Amazon.com about how some episodes would not play, but it had not been resolved until now. After responding to their reply in which they asked me to elaborate on my initial note re the problem, I never heard from them again.I rate this item three stars though I love NCIS -- which is why I have been buying the sets. The rating is for the product itself, not the shows contained in it."
3,Worth buying if you collect Police records,"Below my expectations, especially since I was hoping better Rock artists to perform (eg. Charly Garcia, Soda Stereo, Fito Paez)."
4,I wish there were on-line audio samples...,"I don't have the album(dope!), but got to listen to 3 tracks at a local concert in Austin. Plus, a video i saw on tv. The musician-ship seemed very good for the songs i heard. (note: Gustavo Cerati used to be in Soda Stereo)"
5,they work,i really like these gums yeah their kinda bitter but better than falling asleep behind the wheel. The only thing i noticed i was driving one time got sleepy chewed two no help. I stopped at a gas station bought a 5hour nothing 15minutes later I stopped at another station and bought the 5hour energy extra strength no help. What im trying to say is they might help you stay awake but theres a limit to how much the body can take so also get sleep
4,"Works great, tastes awful.","I chew two of these right after work. They stop the lethargy I sometimes feel after work, making getting to the gym in the evening much easier. So, the gum's efficacy gets 5 stars. The gum's taste, however, gets about one or two stars. It does taste good initially, but it starts tasting just awful--like old coffee--after about 5 minutes. Yes, I still buy the product because it works so well. But if I could find a good-tasting alternative, I'd definitely buy it instead."
2,Military energy gum,Does not have enough caffeine I work night shift and did not helped me at all:(I rather drink a cup o coffee.
2,Tasty,It loses it flavor in about 5 minutes. Does not taste like the flavor. It has a limited time of giving energy.
4,Taste vs. Price,"The cinnamon flavor is horrible tasting, but I bear through it. The caffeine you get from it is well worth it! Try the arctic mint one though, much better flavor"
4,Great for Workouts,"I use this product for my early morning workouts (mostly running), so I need an energy boost to get going. This gum provides the boost I need, and it helps me to have a more productive workout. The cinnamon flavor lasts an entire workout (usually an hour). There is a slight bitter caffeine taste, but that doesn't affect the overall flavor. It's a good product that I'll keep on buying."
2,Works but...,"This product works, it gives you that caffeine kick when you use it. But, my god, the taste! its starts good, cinnamon, but after a minute, it began to taste horrible, to the point that you have to spit it out (not convenient if you want to have the whole caffeine charge the gum has), and leaves you nauseous until you can manage to drink something that takes the taste away from all of your throat. Not worth it, there other products that deliver the energy kick and manage to keep a good taste."
4,Okay If Your Legs Don't Itch,"They work fine for their intended use, if your legs don't itch when confined like that. Mine did. I wanted to use them to stop leg cramps in bed, but one night and I had to rush to tear them off and my legs itched the rest of the day.Of course, that happens with a lot of sox I wear too, but this of course was the whole calf."
3,Not bad,"I purchased two of these bottles. They are nice looking, the cap screws easily into the bottle, and the stainless steel is much healthier than plastic bottles. The price was low, which is nice. One of the bottles leaks if it is not completely upright. The top handle broke within a few weeks of purchasing. The other has no problems."
4,It's a water bottle,"It does the job... No problems, no metallic taste, good cap seal. It does dent easy but whatever. I am sure it will last for years as long as I don't forget it at the gym : P"
2,Cheaply Made,"I loved the great size of this bottle- a full liter and not too fat to hold comfortably- and I thought it would be perfect for my workouts. But the turquoise paint started peelingoff after very limited use. I called the company customer service thinking perhaps they might exchange it for a plain stainless one (unpainted) but they said, no, they would not and they would not take it back. And it sounded like they knew about this problem. Pretty much a waste of money."
2,Good but it could be better,"Quality is good, but they should come complete with an insulated cover, since with ice they cause outside to sweat... Charge more, but be a complete product that makes sense.New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle (1-Liter, Blue)"
5,My Daily Companion,"I bring my stainless steel water bottle everywhere with me. I like this size of bottle, because I drink quite a bit of water. The bottle will dent a little if you drop it, but it's pretty sturdy otherwise. I almost never clean it, because it doesn't get weird smells. I unscrew the top to drink instead of drinking through the cap. I like this bottle. I couldn't bring it into Lollapalooza, so I lost it at the gate. I bought a new one from Amazon and was happy to have my daily companion back with me."
2,Can't chug water with this bottle,"If you are like me and like to chug water, avoid this bottle. The vacuum release valve does not work, so you have to draw water from the bottle with suction. And once the section gets to a point, you can't get any more water. You have to release the pressure by stopping and letting air in. And letting air in makes a squeak.It's cool looking, but I believe function is much more important than form.Additionally, negative reviews don't seem to make it onto their website. So if you see no reviews, consider that no *positive* reviews."
3,"Leaks a bit, sport top drinking is squeaky/noisy, dents easily","Leaks a bit, sport top drinking is squeaky/noisy, dents easily but hey, it's not plastic. I dropped mine. The stainless steel is soft. Doesn't stand up flat any more as the bottom is kind of bowed. The sport top leaks if it's not 100% fully secure. Good idea but product needs to be improved. Would buy again since there's no comparable product except kleen kanteen which has the same issues."
1,New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle,"There are two things I do not like about the Stainless Steel water bottle as follows:1. There is no insulation. When you put ice water in it and hold the bottle, your hands feel freezing cold. (I had to buy a 1 liter bottle holder - made of insulated nylon fabric in order to use it.) The expense of the bottle and insulated bottle wrap was not worth it.2. The plastic pull up stopper that you drink from does not allow enough of the water to come out into your mouth at one time."
3,Buy new sports cap!,The cap broke after only 4 days of use. I bought a Klean Canteen sport cap and it is of much better quality. I have used it for two months now without any problems. The bottle is great with the sport grip. Too bad they make poor quality caps. Oh well.....!
3,Made in China UPDATE: HAS A HOLE!!!,"I wish the fact that this bottle is Made in China was disclosed in the product details.Overall it's a decent stainless steel bottle. I haven't had a leak. It doesn't flow quickly using the sport cap, but I don't think any of the stainless steel bottles do. They do get cold to touch when you put ice in them, same for hot if you were to put something hot in them.UPDATE:After 5 months of us it HAS A HOLE. A HOLE!! in stainless steel!! what a piece of junk!! I'd give it ZERO STARS now, if I could change my rating."
1,New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle,"This would be a good product but the sport cap spout broke after less than two months of moderate use and Amazon will not accept the return. Therefore, I do not recommend purchasing this product with the sport cap."
4,stainless steel bottles,"I think they're great, but I have one creating rust inside and I don't know why. The only thing I put in it is water, however I have salt in the water."
3,too much air with water,It is the perfect size for my bike rides. I love the design and never smells bad... but there is too much air when you suck the water. Shame.
4,Only one problem,"My wife and I love these bottles except for the fact that the sport caps are almost impossible to open when popped all the way down. We leave them mostly closed, and put the protector over the top and that seals them pretty well."
4,Great water bottle,"If you're looking for just a regular water bottle to carry around with you, this works very well. Easy to grip. Non-slip. The steel body seems sturdier than other brands and does not dent easily."
3,Just one thing...,"I like everything about the bottle, except the mouth piece dose not open enough so it's hard to get the water out. Other than that, it keeps the water cold and it's a great size."
2,Insulation please!!!,"This bottle is really nice. The water in it tastes great and mine does not leak or chirp like others have said theirs does.BUT...... I would not recommend this bottle. It has no insulation, so if you put cold water in it, within seconds, it is almost too cold to hold. And within minutes, this bottle is sweating profusely. So then when you pick it up, your hand gets soaked, it drips on your shirt, etc. So then if you go buy the carrier for it, you may as well have bought one of the more expensive bottles.I would not buy this bottle again."
1,horrible water bottle,"I bought this water bottle from the reviews but was very disappointed. The top is very hard to push up and down, it also feels like a lot of air is coming out along with the water and it leaks."
3,way better than plastic,"I bought two of these bottles. The bottle is good, however the cap needs better threads. I have pulled the entire cap off a bunch of times when I as just tring to pull the drinking nib open"
2,leaky lid???,Bought this and the pull out top leaks without the cover on it. I will now have to buy the regular twist off lid and pay shipping on that and hopefully that works out better.
3,Nots so Cool,The new wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle (1 liter) is a great bottle with a convenient capacity. The only drawback is that stainless steel is a good heat conductor so ice water does not stay cold very long. The configuration of the 1 liter bottle does not lend itself to off the shelf insulated covers either. So the bottle is great if you're going to drink your beverage right away but soon gets warm if you keep it for any length of time.It would be great if you could also buy a companion insulating cover.
1,Plastic Portion Pulls out of bottle,I liked the bottle until the entire plastic portion popped out everytime I pulled on the spout to drink from it.
3,A bit cumbersome but cost effective,"I bought this from a local health food store and was surprised to find an inexpensive option to the Sigg and Kleen Kanteen. This, as the KK, is made in China. Water quality out of it is good but I haven't taken it on any long hot outings yet. The drinking spout does chirp and I've found it harder to suck the water out so I just blow air into it displacing the water so it comes out easily - I can't remember right now if it makes a chirp when I do that, but I had a call center job and used it all the time and had no coworker complaints. It does fit into the drink holder in my car nicely, which considering it's size I was a little surprised. I wouldn't want to take it on a bike - to long/tall. Haven't had any leaking problems. My biggest complaint is the cover for the sipping part doesn't stay on anymore so it just flops around uselessly but is still attached to the bottle - I will be cutting it off soon!"
3,OK Bottle...Could be Better,"My wife and I originally used these bottles before I went SIGG and she went Klean Kanteen (KK). I decided I could use these ""old"" stainless bottles elsewhere, but I really, really, really dislike the sipper top so I tried the KK screw top cap with it and it worked! I ordered two additional non-sipper screw top caps to go with these and they work beautifully! After some thinking I believe the same Chinese manufacturing plant produces both these and Klean Kanteen bottles. Except they use different types/thicknesses of stainless steel. Look at the bottle styles on Amazon and you'll find that they are nearly identical, if not exactly, the same as Klean Kanteens. And, the fact that KK caps work with Enviro brands...hmmm...you decide.I personally prefer KK because their stainless steel feels more durable because it uses a thicker steel type than these."
1,Don't waste your money!,This is a terrible water bottle! It is not insulated. Fill it with ice and water and you can't pick it up because it is too cold. Don't drink it fast enough on a hot day and it gets warm. The sport top is too difficult to sip from. What a waste of money!!!
4,No Plastic,Makes me feel more comfortable drinking my water....knowing i am not possibly putting bits of plastic into my system.
1,Garbage!,"Would not hold water! Leaked, poor GC! Don't waste your $. MFG would not stand behind product."
4,Best Value Steel Bottle for the Price,"Recently bought the New Wave Enviro 1 Liter bottle with Sports Cap. For the price it's a great deal, but I would recommend buying the Poly Loop Cap because my husband and I struggle to open the Sports Cap. It is very tight! The steel is very thin, which makes it lighter, but for rough use, I would recommend the Klean Kanteen. The water stored is kept clean and fresh, so this is our little contribution towards helping our planet."
4,Great for Biking,"I purchased this product because I wanted a water bottle that was not made of plastic that I could drink from while biking. I have not seen another one which is steel and this large. This is the perfect size for my long bike rides and other than the cap which is plastic, I have less exposure to plastics leeching into my drinking water."
2,Check the Bottle First,I ordered two of these based off the good reviews. Upon arriving I washed both and then filled them with water which we drank through the day. That night I left mine on the kitchen table. When I woke up the next morning I found that water had leaked out of a small crack on one of them and it ruined the wood on my table and left a small water spot on my floor too! I suspect this was a used bottle. The other bottle is fine but I am very disappointed that this product was sent in this condition. So check and double check for any damages!!!!
2,car traveler,"Bottle has a god grip and tends to keep contents relatively cool. However, the bottle does not fit my car cup holder and the bottom of the bottle is not flat, making placement insecure. Would not repeat order."
2,Dissatisfied,"I didn't like this product because the handle is very small and narrow and my nose hits it everytime I take a drink (and I'm a small person). The other reason I dislike this product is because I thought it would have a straw attached to it to make it easier to drink the beverage that's inside the bottle. When you drink from it, you have to bring head way back then you get the beverage all over your face. Will keep only because I don't want to pay for postage."
1,A HOLE in stainless steel!!!,"I purchased this bottle 5 months ago. In that time it had fairly regular use and sustained a fair number of small dents, which seems to be fairly common with this type of bottle.However- I was VERY much taken aback the last time I filled it and it had developed a pin size hole on the side of it- not where any dent was near. This causes a water to run down the side of the bottle and renders it useless.I think 5 months is much too short a life for a stainless steel bottle. I wish I had invested the money in something that would last. I contacted the company and was told that returns were handled by the seller, no guarantee by them."
2,Too big for it's own good!,"Item description clearly states that it fits nicely in most water bottle cages. Don't believe it. I have tried it on 3 different bikes and it is way too big to fit on any of them. Nothing wrong with the quality, I have 2 other bottles made by the same company and am pleased with all of them. If you're looking for a bottle to carry on a bike you might want to consider something else."
1,Can't handle cold water at all...,I bought a couple of these for my husband to use on his bicycle instead of using plastic bottles. The theory of the design is great... execution... not so great.The quality of the stainless steel is lower than many other bottles. They are much thinner steel which causes the bottles to have issues with cold expansion.I put ice water in the bottle and the mouth of bottle expands to the point where the cap doesn't stay on. It just pulls right off.The threads of the screw top are not deep enough or enough period. It needs to have at least 1-2 more threads for the cap to go on tightly. It just spins loose if you try to tighten it. So it leaks.Not using cool/cold water in the bottle just isn't an option in Texas.I also bought the 12oz bottles which have the same thread and bottle opening... same problems.Save your money and just buy a Klean Kanteen. I've had absolutely no problems with our KK bottles at all.
2,It leaks,I looked forward to this new 'space age' bottle. Its sleek design is futuristic i guess and I love the sturdy design...but it leaks.There is a leak coming from somewhere around the top and i cant find it. I put the bottle in my backpack for school and when I am on the train and need a drink I find everything inside soaked.I wouldnt buy anotherone.
3,Well made but top is problematic,"I love the large size, handy shape and great construction of the water bottle. I can fill it once and it lasts all day. But I would not get the sports top again. The water does not flow freely when the bottle is full. Its a design flaw in the mechanism that allows for air flow. It has to be about 1/2 emty before the water can flow easily."
3,It leaked at the bottom!,"I purchased 2 actually and one leaked through a tiny hole you could only see with a magnifying glass. I purchased it through Amazon and they require you to send it back for an exchange. Well, that would cost me the price of a new one so I didn't. So now I'm using it with a piece of tape on the bottom."
2,Pop-up top impossible to open and close,"I was really excited to get a stainless steel water bottle with a pop top for exercising and a mouth large enough to put ice cubes in, at a decent price. Unfortunately I didn't heed the other comments about the pop-up top being hard to open and close. For me, it was next to impossible. The cap doesn't fit snug onto the pop-up top, so that when looped around your finger, it justs pops right off and the bottle falls to the floor or ground. Poor design. If you don't care about using the pop top (one of the main reasons I bought the bottle), this is a good bottle for the price."
3,enviro stainless bottle,"I thought I liked the design of the Enviro bottle. However, the lip of the bottle is quite wide, so I usually have to pour the liquid into a glass to drink out of it. The plastic cap is rather flimsy, so one should invest in the stainless steel cap. Also, I keep getting a metallic taste when drinking out of it, even though I wash it out with water and baking soda."
1,top is poorly made,I bought two of these. The top of one broke off when I tried to remove the plastic seal; neither I nor my boyfriend could open the drinking spout on the other. I returned them.
4,"great bottle, bottle top not so much","really good price for a quality bottle, but im not a fan of the sports top. it doesn't leak, but the cap doesn't really stay on to protect the nipple from getting dirty. i kind of figured i wouldnt like the top ahead of time, and i would have liked the option to purchase this bottle with the carabiner top like the 20oz and 40oz bottles have. it's possible that i missed it, but i did look for a way to do this. the one liter size fit my needs best, and i saw that i could buy a cap for it later. overall great deal on the bottle, even after shipping it was cheaper than purchasing at a local store. it will be about the same after purchasing the other cap for it, but im not unhappy with the purchase. its very sturdy for the price."
3,Not My Favorite,"I have used this water bottle for a few weeks now. It's bigger than I need. I prefer another style, the Thermos Nissan Stainless Steel Hydration Bottle which is 18 oz. Much nicer in size and I prefer the protective lid that keeps the top covered when not using."
2,Useless,"After only a year of normal use, my stainless steel bottle has a crack near the bottom and now leaks. I would have thought the bottle would have held up better than this."
4,Great bottle!,"I bought two, one for me and one for my husband. We love them. There is no metallic flavor, and its plenty big enough. The only thing we have a problem with is that the sports top is very loud and disturbs his desk neighbors at work. Because he works with computers, any other type of top is not an option. So at work he has to reuse plastic bottles until we can figure out how to fix it. Not a great option but..."
2,Ghost Whisperer season 3.,"I dont know it seemed a bit same old same old, just one episode Id like to see ghosts just leave Melinda alone so we can see her hot husband (awww Jim..) and her auctualy have a normal married life!!Whilst this season didnt impress as much as the last two it still makes me keen for season 4, I mean 1 slow season shouldnt turn me off completely? Right?"
5,Scary!!!!,"I admit, this season really scared me to dead. So spooky and the sub-plots were great. Still I don't like Jennifer's costumes. Sometime in the series, she look like she 6 months pregnant (that was wrost!). But I really love David Conrad. Cute!"
5,Excellent Product,"This item came to me brand new, shrink wrapped and in excellent condition. I am very satisfied."
5,Ghost Season.,"Gho[[ASIN:B000R7I44K Ghost Whisperer - The Second SeasonGhost Whisperer: The Third Seasonst Whisperer - The Complete First Season]]Get ready for season 4 on your t.v.Yes it is a great show and all the cast members work so well together, so well in fact that Ghost Whisperer is coming back on t.v for it's fourth season. Take note of time and date..........Oct 3 Friday at 8 pm/ET 2008"
5,Ghost Whisperer Season 3,"Great Video, as described , fast delivery.Ghost Whisperer - The Third SeasonI just love this series and never miss it and now I can have it on DVD forever."
4,3rd season with the underground city,"More of Melinda secretes was revealed. I was enjoying the plot so much, except the part of the hidden underground city. Melinda went down to the town too often and too easily. This make it not a sacred place any more. Too bad, the video did not have Subtitle at all."
5,Ghost Whisperer,These shows are very good. They are very well written and can't wait to watch the next ones.
5,Great movie,Love the series so was excited to get this. Worked beautifully. Ever time we get a new series we start at the beginning and go all the way through. Ready for season 4.
2,No Spears?,"Nice album. Would have been a lot better with the track recorded with the Spears ""why did it end""."
4,Fun to watch!,"My toddler loves this DVD. She already knows her alphabets so his was just for fun. Be mindful that Grover says the alphabet the wrong way a few times and the way he says it is quite catchy. My toddler likes to say it the way grover says it now, but she does know the difference. So my advice is make sure your kid knows the correct way of saying the alphabet before watching it."
5,Surprisingly it never gets old,"My 2 year old daughter had the ABC's mostly figured out when I bought her this DVD, now she has mastered it. On long car rides or rainy days she wants to watch it over and over again, and I really don't mind it. Elmo is a great character and this is a great educational DVD!"
2,Disappointing,I am very disappointed with the dvd it has a huge scratch on it. and i ordered it new not used and it skips every ten min. plus the package it was delivered in was half way opened when i got it.
3,Was a little disappointed,"I was very excited to get this dvd for my daughter, but nowhere in the dvd is the classic ""abc song"" sung, which for me makes it a little frustrating and more involved than it needs to be, it leaves my daughter's attention very quickly..."
2,A gathering of essays,"I thought it was a book, naturally I found out later that it was a compilation of several papers presented at a seminar in India. It was nearly a total disappointment except for some helpful insights concerning the Islamic community and its sea-trade profession.There was a remarkable excerpt on the Shi'a (Safavid dynasty) involvement within the area and how they disrupt the Islamic political balance resulting in the failure of Ottoman blockade in the Indian Ocean. The ultimate result was the breakthrough of the Portuguese, and other western powers, into the far east where naval supremacy reigns.These few remarks somehow balanced the final equation of this shallow 'book'."
4,rear window louver,"great product,quality is good...instructions and materials.need two people for proper install."
5,on principal,I am rating this 5 stars even before reading it to counter the moron who felt it necessary to give one star for a title/main character name he didn't like. He said he would ammend it but hasn't yet. If you wish to read which one I refer to it is historyprof. I can't stand the thought of a book getting a bad rep for one uneducated opinion.
3,Not the Best,"This is not the oginal recording. Song like Mind Blowing Decisions, Ain't No Half Steppin, Always & Forever, Feel Like Making Love, The Groove Line , and Too Hot To Handle are not the song the way I knew come up. This is a REMAKE of Heatwave Best. Some Old Member are thier."
5,Best pre/post natal DVDs ever!!!!,"Attention MOMS: I strongly urge anyone in the market for a pre/post natal video to purchase Lindsay Brin's DVDs. I am a working mother, and just gave birth to my 3rd child. I have ordered and used various other pregnancy DVDs in the past, but this collection has truly proved to be AMAZING. Lindsay Brin's workout sessions are dynamic, fun, easy and thorough. She is so fun to watch, and makes you feel motivated. Do not waste your money on any other pregnancy fitness DVDs, this is it!!!"
2,Poor quality,"The quality is poor...symbols are painted on...and not very well. They look cheap. These are just going to be small hostess gifts...but they look like they will not last long. Also, when you add the postage to cost of product...definitely not worth it."
3,Clever but Homemade Looking,"I was happy to find a mahjong themed gift item, but disappointed in the ""hand painting"" on the handle. I would have ordered several more if the quality had been better."
3,Hallan's Adventures,"All the pioneers had a reason for crossing the Alleghenies. Some wanted to hunt, others wanted to make a better life for their family, there were those that wanted to escaped a forced marriage, and of course some wanted to escaped being accused of killing someone. Davis Hallam was accused of killing his unfaithful wife. He joined a crew that was widening the Wilderness Road. Reasoner keeps his stories moving with Hallan adventures. This is not one of his best. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,Great,Very good story and kept my interest. The pace of the action and accuracy was just right. I would recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction.
4,Nice Story by James Reasnoner,"The dialect was a little difficult to follow the first few pages, but as the main character progressed in his journey to gain knowledge, the dialect became more understandable. I liked the plot, it kept me wanting to read more."
2,Not a cowboy book.,"This story is set in l790's Virginia and Kentucky and involves pioneer settlers with flintlock firearms and not as depicted by the cover of this book showing a cowboy with a six gun strapped on and carrying evidently a winchester type firearm, the story is so-so about a man falsly accused of murdering his unfaithful wife and escaping from the Shenandoah Valley, helping to forge the wilderness trail into Kentucky, I really like book covers that show a scene so to speak from the story, this one couldn't be any farther from the story, if you want to read a really good cowboy book try Luke Short and Lauren Paine."
5,the perfect pan for many uses,"Throw away your nonstick cake pans, this pan is perfect for cakes, pies and well almost any use in oven or stove top. Like all Le Creuset it browns food beautifully and cleans easily. I'm actually using it more on the stove than in the oven. I love this pan."
1,Poor explanations,"The code examples were not clearly explained, making it difficult to use the example as a starting point for you to write your own related code. I think it tried to cover too many topics, and covered none very well. After trying unsuccessfully to use this to learn new web programming, I bought 2 very good JavaScript books. For awhile I still tried using this book as a reference (who wants to abandon a $45 book), but it was of very little use."
4,Glad to hear it again,"I really loved these albums when I was in high school.I practically played the grooves off them.I had almost forgot how different Nicks voice could sound.But it sets him apart,I guess.What I really liked was the band.I loved the distortion his guitar player used.Nick did have some pretty good lyrics though(not sure who wrote the songs)and they still hold up.If you really like 80s music give these a listen."
5,"Wonderful resource, from classic to the present.","This is an excellent book for multicultural studies of American fiction and good for reading pleasure or educational uses. The writers included are of the best calibre and the stories varied in tone, humor and drama, tragedy and laughter. Daniela Gioseffi's story Rosa in Television Land is absolutely superb and entertaining. Excellent! I love Nathaniel Hawthorne's little known story, The Maypole of Marymount. Well done. Great anthology."
5,volume 4,"All I have to say about this volume is that the ending to this series is HILARIOUS. Believe me, I did not suspect it."
4,Family Heritage,"While reading this book, I became more aware of family heritage. I also feel that most families will relate in some ways. A lot of families have war heroes, problems with alcohol, abuses and the tragic losses of loved ones. They also have love, in some manner, the courage to have the stamina to fight on, and as a child, suffer many indignities. This book not only reveals real life, but puts you in the story, making you a part of the happiness and tragedies. It is a must read, especially for those who do not understand what makes some rejected and abused children persevere, and others turn to lives of crime. A good book for adults just starting their own families. Easy, smooth reading, candid and has a lesson for everyone."
3,3 User means 3 installations!!!!,"I had some issues with my hardware(motherboard had bad IDE channel) and had to reinstall everything a few times on my computer before I figured out what was a problem. It appears that PC-cillin allows only 3 installations. That what they mean when sell 3-user software. May be in Chinese it is the same, but sounds like cheating in English."
1,Enough said.,"I have just exited from Pc Cillin 2007 for the last time. I am very dissatisfied with this newest version of what was a very good piece of software in 2005 and 2006.Aside from being alerted every couple of hours or less of a new threat update and download, I have had it with the extreme use of resource. My downloads have gone from 1.7 Mbps. to 200Kbps. I have tolerated this up and down scenerio for some time. NO MORE.I am sure that Trend will figure out what to do with this program in time, but, for now I will be looking elsewere for something else. Not McAfee or Norton, though. I may try dumping 2007 and try to get 2006 to work again.Anyway, I would not recommend this product until there is some kind of update or fix.I didn't mind a little slow down to take advantage of the features, but, this is unacceptable.The best of the Holidays to all.Ed"
2,High Tech Molasses,"Google ""Trend Micro 2007 Slow"" and see what you get.You get what yo pay for.I really liked Trend Micro Internet Security 2005 and 2006. I figured if Dell uses Trend Micro that it has too be a decent program, but I was wrong. Dell is using a rebranded version of 2006 called Internet Security 14. So, Dell has yet to jump into Trend Micro Internet Security 2007.Don't call Trend for Support - it's neither effective or readily accessible.Get a new copy of 2006 while you still can and give Trend time to come up with a fix for 2007."
2,It was OK for a while,"At first it worked OK but it started to make files. Thousand of file and I was losing one to two GBs per day. I contacted them but got no help. Their reply was ""I understand you are having trouble installing PC-Cillin"". That was their answer. After I found the files it took over an hour to delete them. This was probably an isolated case but they could have done a better job in helping. Or at least read my email so it make some kind of sense."
1,really wanted to like it,I used this Program for the last year and have had many quarrels with itmainly:it missed a ton of spyware and a couple of trojans on my computer. even though i religiously update the virus definitionssignificantly slowed down my computer.and what really made me angry is that when i deleted the program it would not fully delete and took me 3 hours to remove the entire program. which involved searching for individual files and deleteing them manually.i switched to avg free edition which has worked admirably.
1,TM Pc-Cillin 2007 Blows,"I have a number of machines that I manage with this product installed. They worked great on previous version of PC-Cillin until I installed pc-cillin Internet Security 2007, then every thing RAN SLOW... It also gobbles up huge amounts of RAM. I have 1GB RAM and all of my systems become progressively slower as the day goes on. After one day of being powered on the computer is useless as it is too slow and idles with ~600MB RAM used when not doing anything. This 2007 program seems to have become some kind of virus itself... DO NOT BUY!I will start moving my machines over to something else."
2,SLOW SLOW SLOW,"Once my computer is on for a while and the pc-cillin is fully loaded it seems okay. But it takes 10 &%#$@ minutes to load and to let me do anything with my computer (Dell 1505 laptop bought new in 2006).I am changing to Norton soon. Forget ""PC-illin'"""
3,"Plus / Minus, I'm moving on","I initially had many problems with both computers after updating from 2006 to the 2007 software. The biggest problem was hogged resources and slow computers. I was able to fix all problems on one computer running XP Professional, with TrendMicro's help, so that now PC-Cillin 07' is working flawlessly and only using 10-18,000k memory at a time.However, on my other computer running Windows XP Home I have not been able to get it working well and it hogs resources continuously. One problem seems to be incompatibility with Outlook 2003 which I do not run on the other computer. PC-Cillin slows Outlook 2003 to a crawl. I am changing to Kaspersky 6.0. I have tried the 30 day trial, and so far, so good."
1,"Works, because it doesn't let you out onto the internet.","Paid for, downloaded and installed it on XP Home with all the updates and IE7.My IE7 would hang after going to one or two web pages. Tried ending IE7 and finally resorting to rebooting the computer.I decide to wipe out my computer and reinstall XP and IE7 with all updates then installed Trend again. Short story I ended up uninstalling Trend.Now I'm emailing Trend and searching the internet for solutions...FYI: keep in mind I did clean and new install of XP and IE7 no other programs other then Trend"
1,PC-Cillin 2007 will slow down your PC/Laptop to a crawl!,"Absolutely kills my PC's and laptops (typically a 2.2Ghz CPU with 2GB of RAM) with a process named PcScnSrv.exe alone using over 85% of CPU continually, and 120 MB+ memory, just for this process. Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007 is terrible. I've used PC-Cillin since version 2003, and until this version it has been a good product. Even 2006 was fine. 2007 is a bomb, so do not purchase it or upgrade it. Just delete your registry keys for Trend and reinstall your 2006 version, and you will be better off, until Trend Micro fixes this disastrous problem. I've been working with technical support every day (the ""Customer Escalation Team"") since 04/05/2007, with no end in sight so far, and it is now 06/04/2007!"
2,"Memory Hog now , but they may fix it in January 2007-I hope..","Tried the TrendMicro trial of Pc-Cillin after reading many Amazon and other reviews of the 2007 version. They were right, it took about 150 mb RAM on a 512 mb RAM system using Win 2000 Pro..really pretty inefficient! Granted, the real-time antispy has been beefed up quite a bit, but at what a cost..the 2006 version uses less than half that amount of RAM, plus the 2007 version uses about double the hard drive space to boot..! Stick with Pc-Cillin, but use the 2006 version until they tame this thing down a bit. From what I've read there's a refresh build coming out some time in January 2007, try it out then.."
1,Easy Installation of non working product,"I had IS 2006 installed on my W2000 machine and my virus subscription was coming to an end. I decided to purchase the 3 user package from Trend Micro. Installation on my W2000 was flawless. The software loaded after the computer was rebooted. I tried to register but only clicked on dead buttons. I tried to scan but nothing happened. Trend Micro customer service has been responding at a rate of 1 email/week. The first rep thought I had IS2006 rather than IS2007 so I had to wait another week for a response. The second rep had me download the latest installer from their website. Curiously, it seemed to have the same information as the file on the CD. Not so curiously, it gave the same result as the installation from the CD. I've been a satisfied Trend Micro customer for at least 2 years and I think that association has come to an end.You may want to try downloading their trial version from their website before you purchase this product."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!,"My computer would not install this program. It kept asking me to insert disc 1 while disc 1 was sitting in the drive. Spent three hours on phone with tech support. they had me download two different patches, then it still wouldn't install. Tech support kept putting me on hold (because they didn't know how to solve the problem). I was as nice and courteous as possible, and I spoke very clearly to ensure that there was no communication problem. Finally, after putting me on hold for a fifth time, the technician covertly disconnected the call. Nice, huh? Look, I don't want to endorse any antivirus product, but I can say that spending my money on this has been a miserable experience. I STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT BUYING THIS PRODUCT.Thank you,Jason L. Garner[...]"
1,Bad Version,"I installed this in January, 2007 and for 20 days I had continuous lockups and ""not responding"" problems with my internet. Finally after much frustration I called the manufacturer (I couldn't go on line because my computer would freeze!), waited a great deal of time only to find out that I had purchased their first 2007 version with lots of bugs. they downloaded the update and all is well. Nowhere did it give me this info in the updates!"
3,Thank you Pc-cillin to have my PC work hard,"I just have this PC security suite installed and am having same issue as other previous reviews mentioned:"" CPU usage!!"" Man this software have my PC work hard, I am really happy about it because that PC-cillin have the PC work hard that mean I get what I am paid for the PC. And secondly, I also noticed that the HD is working very hard now. The chance is good for me to retired my workhorse P-III.I have been refuse Norton for a long time since my office PC crawled by norton on every PC. I have heard lots of good words about the PC-cillin, so I uninstalled the outdated zone alarm firewall,spy sweeper to get the PC-cillin installation done. NOt sure if it is good thing..."
1,WOUNLDNT WORK,iT MAY BE A GOOD PRODUCT BUT WOULDNT WORK ON MY COMPUTER. I T WOULDN'T INSTALL. IT SAID IT WOULD WORK ON COMPUTERS WITH ME BUT IT DIDN'T
2,Disappointed,"I've used Pc-cillin for several years and have generally been pleased. The newest version was a nightmare to install--so bad was the first try that I had to use system restore to get a semi-stable system back. Note that I followed all of the directions religiously. I finally gave up on the firewall (admittedly, I had disliked their firewall in the earlier versions and used the XP firewall instead) and after four tries finally got the anti-virus part to install. That seems to work OK, but what should have been a ten-minute undertaking turned into a 3+ hour ordeal. This product was definitely not ready for prime time."
3,"Poor support, compatibility issues","On the whole, this product works well. However, be aware of the following issues:- Trend Micro's support is abysmal if you have any issue beyond very simple setup and use.- The product does not work properly with any kind of VPN connection.- Both the product and Trend's web sites do not work with Firefox; they force you to use IE.If none of the above matters to you, this is a sensible purchase. Heck, all of the above matters to me, but I still use the product."
1,"Too many bugs, too much wasted time","Was Norton IS user, reviews convinced me that TMIS2007 would require less resources but....Problems began immediately.I have a Gateway laptop running XP Pro, with no extraordinary apps. The problems included:Icon would not appear in system tray and was not scanning email; TM support, after 5 calls, 4 unanswered emails,I learned IS2007 placed 2 entries in the configuration file, had to disable one; TM advised issue will be fixed in January 2007 build.TMIS2007 would not scan my system, Error"" ""Scan could not complete, see TM online help""; I could not find a solution for this on the WEB site.TM user support recommended I install TMIS2006 until January when the next build would be released. Note that the TMIS2006 version is available for $4.00.I'm done.... I have spent over 3 days trying to fix, finally gave up, decided my $40+ is down the rat hole and decided to try McAfee."
2,"Loved 2006, I'm uninstalling 2007","Very disappointing!!! While 2007 works, I only use antivirus and spyware defenses. This software slows my normally fast computer to a crawl. The updates run slow and it takes alot of time to update the anti-spam database (that I am NOT using and have turned off). I'm uninstalling it as soon as I find it's replacement. I used Norton before 2006 and tried 2006 based on it's reviews and it wasn't hog on the computer's resources like 2007 is...that's what I want, an effective program that doesn't kill the performance of the PC."
2,Not As Good As It Used To Be,"This is my third year for the product and the first year was the best. This year the product would not install. Tech support did help me, I had to download the newest version, they said there were a lot of bugs in the CD. My pc runs much slower now, it can't seem to clean out the spyware and it seems they have concentrated on bells and whistles rather than sticking to basics. I will probably look for a new vendor when my current license expires."
4,This Security Suite does what is supposed to do!,"I've been using Norton AntiVirus, Zone Alarm Pro, and Webroot Spysweeper for years. Depending on the update one or the other caused intermittent problems with lockups and problems shutting down. For a time I couldn't even run chkdsk on my system. After I set up my companies VPN thing got worse. I uninstalled all the above software, cleaned out the registry and installed PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007. My problems all went away. This program does what it is supposed to do. I've had no problems since I installed it in Oct 2006. I've even been able to use PC Tools Spyware Doctor as a backup but PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007 has even handled that task well. In addition, the spam filter works better than the one included with Zone Alarm. Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised and satisfied with my choice."
1,Not good spyware and killed other better spyware software I had installed,"I used the 2006 on one computer, went to install this software on my laptop and it uninstalled webroot spyware which I thought had better gui and coverage. Not happy about that!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I brought 2007 PC-cillin and installed in my computer, however that was a big mistake. My computer has shut down and re-start at random times until I removed from my PC;The technical suports sent me two different versions(lastest build version) to install but it's still not working!!!"
3,PC-Cillin Security 2007,"Generally satisfied with this software package.After it's installation I was unable to connect with my CD Drive and had to have Tech Service help. The e-mail help was fairly prompt (apparently from India)and after 3 tries, successful.The utility has been effective in detecting potentially hazardous or spam oriented sites and e-mail. It has been more problem-free than Norton's utility and can be installed on 3 computers. Glad I switched."
3,Bloated Resource Hog,"This used to be a good utility -- lean and mean. When I initially installed the 2007 version, I thought something was seriously wrong with the computer. Shutdown is the worst; seems to take forever when you are in a hurry. Exiting the program is worth the trouble, (even after fielding all the dire warnings)-- speeds shutdown by 10x.That said, it still seems to accomplish its primary mission; I am not quite ready to say it's worse than Norton or McAffee. The frequent updates say something for it. I will continue to muddle until it expires later this year, but unless there is some indication that this act comes together, I will look for alternatives before I renew it. CA-Antivirus looks attractive."
1,Text Messaging Doesn't Work,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you.The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.Innovation in money-making at its finest."
5,Great Phone,"This phone is great if you don't care about vision capabilities. I used to have a samsung sch-3500 earlier, and this phone beats it in all aspects. I am very satisfied with it's performance."
3,"Love the Phone, BUT...!","I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly.Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)"
2,Nice Display but falsly advertised,I got this phone in november 2003 I was really excited to upgrade from a 3390. This phone has a great display and wallpapers but soonly enough I realized that this phones textmessaging does not work. I got in touch with Sprint and they said that it was to be launched January 18th whichhas passed and it still doesnt work. Not to mention the coverage sux! i went 2 the mall down the street from my house and they charged me roaming charges. So i am now getting a new cellphone because I cant take any more of sprints crap!
2,There is no web browser or wireless internet capability,"My Kyocera QCP-3035's battery died and was replaced by this Nokia about a week ago. The phone has no web browser despite Sprint's product info description. Neither the enclosed hardcopy guide nor the downloadable version made mention of a browser. I called Sprint and their techs were unable to locate anything either. The Rep said she'd be reporting this flaw to her supervisor and perhaps there might be a recall of the phone. I would like to see Sprint offer more phone than they offer. The bigger font and color screen are good but I don't have the same bells & whistles that I took for granted on my ""old"" phone. Locking this phone manually to prevent accidental calls as well as using the voice command (when driving) is a pain. I will be returning this phone next week."
1,PCS Nokia Crap,"If you want a phone that never gets any reception, makes you afraid that the entire thing will fall apart, randomly lets you know when you have voicemail, and constantly has you at the Sprint store because the battery has failed yet again, then this is the phone for you.Sprint should be ashamed of selling this thing. Pure excrement. I can't wait till my contract is up."
1,No!,"This phone is junky, and it is always falling apart. Some of the features are neat, but this phone is terrible with reception, compatibility and more!!!!! The battery has been charged many times and it dies rapidly! Don't purchase this phone!"
4,Problem with 3588i universal headset,"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset."
3,Pissed off-a little bit,ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.
1,Dangerously inaccurate book,"Hike 13, ""Alander Mountain Loop"", contains blatant mistakes (""follow the road south, bearing right at the fork"" when the road south really goes left; or ""turn right into East Street"", actually called ""Mount Washington Street"") and imprecise descriptions which can have dire consequences if you get lost trying to follow directions, as I did last week-end: hours of walking without knowing where I was heading (the map shows only the intended trail, not at all the other existing trails) before finding a road and stopping someone who was kind enough to drive me back to my car 30 minutes away. I can't comment about the other walks - I did not try them and am not about to do so."
1,unbelievable,I find it hard to review this product since I bought a new one online (not Amazon) and the ostia software was not in it. The company does not back their product. They would not help me in no way. I do not like sending business to a company that does not look out for their customers. I don't think Pharos is a company anyone should buy from. I am on disability and have memory problems if anyone has any suggestions please let me know.
1,historical fiction,Attention history buffs: don't miss the fact that this book is fiction! Somehow I did and was very disappointed.
5,"Mesmerizing - slow-moving, low-event music of incredible soothing power","Over two hours of slow-moving, low-event music for violin and string quartet (1985). If you don't have the fabric for that kind of stuff, you're likely to find it tedious, senseless, maddening. But if you are in for it - it's mesmerizing. It is music of incredible soothing power, gently rocking, animated by a slow pulse evoking the deep breathing of some gentle giant or the calm but implacable wash and backwash of the sea on a pebble beach. It'll get you high, the effect is probably the same as pot, only it's ingested through the ear and its entirely legal. Use caution, though: you might get an addiction.Maybe that is how the sirens of Ulysses sounded, or maybe that is how it feels to glide along the River Styx on Charon's ferry. It is a journey."
5,Excellent!,"This book is fantastic. Bahnsen does a phenomenal job of clarifying and presenting Van Til's ideas in an understandable format. Both men were amazing Christian thinkers and this fact shines through! I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in not only strengthening, but defending his or her faith. This book provides an excellent foundation in apologetics!"
5,Catholic who loved this book,"This book is very well written and great, however, there are times when Bahnsen seemed to imply that VanTil was the first Christian thinker since the Apostle Paul to see clearly that human knowledge and reason are utterly dependent on the Christian God (1976a, p. 232). However, Van Til himself misunderstood Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic writers. Dr. Greg L. Bahnson, although very brilliant, also followed Van Til in misunderstanding Thomas Aquinas. This is stated more clearly by Van Tils successor, John M. Frame, in his book Cornelius Van Til : An Analysis of His Thought. Where Frame admits that Van Til misunderstood Thomas Aquinas. However, this book is very well written and is a must have for all Christian apologetics."
2,Not so hot.,"The blurb on the back of this book states that it ""meets the urgent need for a comprehensive introduction to SDL..."". Unfortunately, it stops at providing an introduction to SDL and for readers wishing to go deeper (anyone specifying or developing software with SDL, for instance) will quickly be frustrated by the superficial treatment which the subject matter is dealt with.Two stars - because it did at least provide an introduction."
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews for this product before I ordered it, it got great reviews, I am sorry to say that I don't agree. It is so not worth the money and not holding up well at all. My dog is only 58 pounds, and this bed has not held up well at all. We have had it about two months, and already it is broken down and has a deep crater in it. I keep turning it around and over, but it doesn't help. The cover has also worn very quickly. In my opinion, really not worth the money I spent on it."
1,"Overpriced, poor quality","I'm extremely disappointed with this product and am surprised to see as many positive reviews as there are. I've had this for about three weeks, and already there is a depression in the bed where my dog sleeps that does not return to form over the course of the day when he's not using it. Clearly, this is poor quality foam being sold with a cheap cover for an exorbitant price. This may be fine for a smaller dog that weighs 20-30 pounds, but for a larger dog, Lab, etc., look elsewhere...or just go to Walmart where you can buy your own cheap foam for a lot less money and just plan on replacing it once in awhile.Update 1/12/12 - As I look at this $100+ bed with the huge ""hole"" in the foam where my dog lays...I'm reminded how bad this bed really was. And it's been like this since about a month after I ordered it. Stay away from this one for sure..."
3,Hardly Better Than Earth Crisis,"Freya is the band that a couple of members from Earth Crisis formed up after EC disbanded. They play melodic hardcore, much in the vein of the last EC full-length, 'Slither'. They're nowhere near as hard as EC was and the lyrics here are not militant sXe. I'm not saying thats a bad thing but you have to realize that Freya is definitely not EC.'As The Last Light Drains' is a good album but hardly great. Anyone who thinks that this album can stand up to EC tracks like ""All Out War"", ""Gomorrah's Season Ends"", ""Firestorm"", ""Broken Foundation"" or ""Stand By"" is absolutely insane.EC was one of the best hardcore bands of all-time. Freya is good no doubt, but they can't hold EC's jockstrap."
5,Will leave you begging for more,"If you had followed Earth Crisis like I have been for a while now. You'd know theres talent within these guys, from ""Breed The Killers"" to ""Firestorm"" to ""Last Of The Sane""... Earth Crisis was a political monster that seemed unsilenceably dominant over straight edge hardcore/metal music. Now 2003 A.D. Earth Crisis boils away as Freya arises. Not just Karl, Eric and Bulldog but a new drummer and 2nd singer/guitarist too! They flow together perfectly, no politics here just artistic expression that rivals the best in Hardcore/Metal today. This is a fantastic album, full of hooks, grinding riffs, and talent talent talent. This CD is perfect length under 40 minutes, straight up, to the point one of the best things to come out of Victory to date and one of the best CDs I've gotten my hands on all year! The gods are on your side."
2,Unholy Alliance,"Soundscapes which paste in music usually do so because the recordists fear the natural sounds alone won't hold the listener's interest. On the opposite side musicians sometimes include sound effects to try to distract the listener from sub-par music.Neither strategy guarantees success.David Rothenberg's quartet consists of clarinet, guitar, bass and small percussion playing indulgent new agey ""jazz lite"" with spoken poetry over about half the tunes.The quartet's guitarist Douglas Quin brought with him several field recordings of birds, frogs, wind & weather. There is no apparent connection with the music or the words being recited.The combination though well-meaning never rises above the drearily ordinary."
2,Vague Intoduction to Bioinstrumentation,"I read this book as a junior in my undergraduate work and if I didn't already have a background in the topics, I wouldn't know what this book was talking about. The principles are described very vaguely and the mathematics and physical concepts of bioinstruments are presented without sufficient support. This book leaves a lot of gaps that are better filled in with another book."
1,Vageuly written,It is a very vaguely written book and a lot of stuff is just unexplained. This book does not help the reader. Unfortunately it is a prescribed text book for my course and I had to buy it. But I refer to other books and websites for the concepts.
5,towel lover,"I have had this for 2 years. My second home is in the mountains and it is very dry. This is a nice, nearly quiet humidfier. It works well and I have never had the problems the above reviewers have. I would happily buy it again.A. Wiggins"
1,"""Carefree""?????","I bought 2 of these humidifiers less than a year ago without reading the reviews. There's nothing ""Carefree"" about them...constant cleaning is a must, and I've replaced the 4 filters twice (at $8 each plus shipping...I couldn't find them at any store). Cleaning the filters per the manufacturer's instructions was a pointless waste of time. I have water with slightly high iron content, but I filtered it & still had problems. They were both due for yet another cleaning last night and halfway through I decided I've invested too much time in these ""carefree"" units and threw them away."
2,Not so impressed,"We purchased one of these humidifiers a few years ago, and thought it worked fairly well. It was definately noisier than other humidifiers, but it had the night light feature and permanent filters that we were looking for in the product. Needless to say we purchased a second one for our other childs room and this one has had all sorts of problems. It is noisier than the first one we purchased even though it claims to be the same decible rating, its' nightlight quit working within 4 months, and it goes through water much faster than our other one. Permanent filters are overrated - they are very hard to clean (as is the whole unit). I say skip this one and find yourself a nice ultrasonic one."
1,Noisy Fan Plus Loud Vibration,"I just got this humidifier yesterday and used it in my bedroom for the first night. I was able to sleep over the sound of the fan, but then at 6:00 AM I started hearing a lot of noise. At first I thought that the neighbors were playing the stereo. Then, I thought that someone was warming up a Harley in the parking lot. It turned out to be the humidifier. It was making a very loud vibration noise, which was even worse in the room below. I put it on a milk crate to get it off the carpet and put some padding underneath it. That helped, but if it doesn't any better in the next few nights, it is going back.I have the yellow stuff in the water too, but it is just the anti-bacteria coating from the filters so it is not a problem."
2,To good to be true,"I'm so tired of these false advertisements on product packages and commercials. Like the ionic breeze air purifier that claims to be good, but just falls extremely short in all tests. This humidifier is very loud...continuos water gurgle noises are very annoying when trying to sleep. This is caused by the air bubble release in the tank. Like the other reviewers claim; a yellow slime takes no time to form. Night light feature on mine broke after a month or so. I still use this humidifier because i cant afford to spend 40 bucks on another just yet...so until then i'll have to just turn my tv way up to hear over this damn thing. When will these companies make good products and actually listen to reviews like these. The box to this product mentions something to the effect of it having mildew or algae buildup protection...this is a lie. I'll never buy another hunter product again."
1,This one's a true DUD,"I purchased this humidifier in December. Less than two months later it has stopped working. Dealing with customer support has been a waste of time. They provided some instructions that did not even apply to the model I purchased. Lots of run around in email chains also, appearing that they have techinical support, but when it comes down to it, they'll ask you to lug it back to wherever you purcahsed it. If I could rate it a negative star, on a one to five scale, this one would get a -5 and their customer support a -5. Oh forget the 5 year warranty. With all the run around, I doubt it will be honored."
4,"Works, but not very quiet","Got this one just 2 days ago. Went through 3/4 of the water tank in a night, but I put it right next to a radiator for maximum evaporation. Seems to work nice, but the fan is pretty noticeable in a quiet bedroom, even at lowest setting. It does move quiet a bit of air though, even at the low setting.I will keep it and hope the permanent filter holds up. Previously had a Holmes with the paper filters that sit in the water - I would not recommend those... they always mold up FWIW..."
