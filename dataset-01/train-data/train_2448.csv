3,Fun pasttime but has some technical difficulties,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has enjoyed it but it seems to have some technical difficulties. While playing a game it will freeze. The only way to reset it is to turn it off and then back on.
5,Atari Flashback II,"I purchased this game for my Marine son serving in Iraq (he's30). His two brothers, 35 and 22 both weighed in on the decision to purchase it. They both had played it and said it was awesome. They were right, I just had an email from my Marine and he deemed it ""way cool"" because it was like what he played as a kid. I am thrilled it was a hit and is being played by many of his Marine buddies as well. They have few amenities or distractions overseas so I appreciate being able to bring a little fun to their lives."
2,Atari Flashback 2,I liked the orginal 2600 better but of course that is a mute point. I did not like the fact the power button is not lit and I did not like the the fact that you have to power off to get to the main menu after you have finsihed with a game. Other than that the product if pretty much what I expected.
5,Perfect recreation of a classic!,"This game is a perfect recreation of the original Atari VCS 2600, right down to the last atom. You can even put a cartridge port on it to turn it into a fully-fledged Atari console! You have to get it!"
5,Awe inspiring,"This is one of the best books I've read. It's an incredible story of a girl who was inspired to do something painful and difficult -- both to test herself and for the thrill and love of the cold water. It's very well written and hard to put down. I have recommended this book to friends and family members who swim, as well as other people who enjoy reading about accomplished women. I found myself cheering her on in each swim and feeling what she felt. After reading this I can never complain again about getting tired from swimming a few laps! Go Lynne!"
3,Rather disappointing,"Based on the other reviews, I was quite excited about reading this book as I generally enjoy books about athletic exploits by unusual athletes. However, Lynne Cox never quite explained why she was doing what she did. By the time she was swimming to Antarctica, I was left asking why??Unlike, say, Lance Armstrong's book, Lynne lacked a central goal, and so the book was really a series of short stories about the various swims she tackled. As one other reviewer pointed out, it became somewhat repetitive. The early stories about swimming in California and the English Channel were to me more interesting simply because it was the first time I heard the tale.The book isn't bad, but it's also not great."
5,Inspiring Story,"I was promted to read this book after hearing Lynne speak at a conference. Her determination is amazing! What really impressed me was that she is not at all what I expected of a long-distance swimmer. She is very down to earth and almost soft-spoken. She is not some ultra-buff althlete looking person. She looks like the average person on the street. Most of all, she is not at all intimidating. Swimming is truly a labor of love for her, as is bridging nations. Very inspiring!"
2,Lynn is AMAZING but her book is not,"Lynn Cox has accomplished so many remarkable feats in her life from swimming the English Channel to swimming the Bering Strait. But after the first third of the book, it is repiticious to the point of tears. Every swim is a challenge, all the water is cold, really cold or impossibly cold. All true and all written so boringly that its painful. What Lynn Cox needed was a better editor, a co-author or more likely both. Swim fans will love the book anyway, but those of us simply reading for inspiration or adventure will have better luck elsewhere else. See Long Distance by Bill McKibben or one of the many books about the Badwater Ultramarathon."
3,"Four Stars for the Author, One Star for the Editor","As an avid swimmer and reader,this book was a bit of a disappointment for me. I truly admire the author's determination and swimming prowess but her character emerges as one dimensional, which I'm sure it is not. There is little reference to her non-swimming life. Am I to believe, for example, that she never had any romantic relationships all those years? Was her life entirely about long distance swimming? Where is she today, in her mid-forties?I was also disappointed by the fact that there are no photos or maps ! How is that possible in such a book?Also, I feel that least 50 pages of the current edition could have been dropped. I would like to have read more about Ms. Cox's training, nutrition, etc. I don't even know what she looks like (height, weight).In short: good story, bad editor."
5,Great Book,"Lynne Cox is very brave and her determination to succeed in every aspect of her life was very inspiring. She proves that when you have a passion for something and are willing to work for it, then nothing is out of reach. I really enjoyed this book not just because of that, but also because Lynn proves that she is just as skilled of a writer as she is a swimmer! She captures and holds your attention right to the end, describing in detail her life as a long-distance swimmer. The best way that I can explain it is that it was so good it was almost like reading fiction, if that makes sense.I loved this book and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read. You definitely don't have to love swimming to love this book, that's for sure. But I actually do love swimming and it inspires me to try my best at that when summer rolls around.My only problem with the book is that I wish she hadn't wrote an autobiography so soon! I'm dying to read more!"
5,very different,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I too was lookingfor more pictures. I kept studying the picturesthat were enclosed, but could have gone for more.I also like swimming, so I understood her heart.Excellent read.10/14/05"
1,Swimming to Antartica,This is a terrific book about an individual challenging herself and at the same time making a difference in the world.
3,"Too small for a Dell 15"" laptop!","I have a Dell Studio 15, and it does not fit in this tote...unless I place it in sideways. I am thinking about cutting out the padded divider as did another reviewer, or else I will have to return it."
4,Very inexpensive and quite decent.,"I have three machines hooked up to this box and, so far, it's performing no worse than the Belkin and other boxes I've used in the past. Since those vendors charge about as much for one set of cables as this entire unit costs, that makes it fairly impressive.The only complaint I might have so far is that the fit and finish of the box feels a bit sub-par. The case is a bit flimsy looking but, I suspect, as long as it's not abused, this won't impact functionality.Video shows absolutely NO noticeable degradation, which I couldn't say about the Belkins I've used. Switching works fine. My vanilla PS/2 keyboard and mouse work without incident.I'm going to try a USB mouse with a PS/2 adaptor just for grins. If it doesn't work, no big deal since the manufacturer made no promises. But I've heard stories of them working fine.I don't regret the purchase and I'd buy it again. It's a great deal."
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me!,"This is the worse P.O.S. I have ever seen sold by anyone online. This item is very dirty, scratched and nasty looking. I do not want to touch it without latex gloves on.And where are the cables? Never mind that this product came beyond the dated expiration time frame; this seller did not even attempt to get ahold of me, despite me emailing them, until the very last minute.And like I have never bought anything online before...try for over 10 years. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard the same old excuse, ""The post office, or UPS, damaged the box and contacted us so we asked for it to come back..."", please, that is as old as dirt!I am sending this back and will contact my credit card company and Amazon to report this serious violation of respected internet trade.I usually am a repeat buyer from successful sellers---you can bet your life I will never do business with this person again."
2,Returned to store. Does not work with wireless .,"I called Iogear after everything was set up, and they told me that this one doesnt work with wireless. I called back and asked what they suggest, and they said try GCS1732 or GSC1734, they should work with wireless. After my call, Im questioning the quality of Iogears tech support.Ofcouse the models that work with wireless are priced between 140 and 190. I think I will just have to pull my 17"" CRT out of storage for a while.Until LCD prices come down a little."
1,Did not work for me,"I used this product for several months and did not see any positive results from using it. I have NEVER personally had any good results, acne-wise, from using salicylic acid based products. I have stubborn, hormonal acne, and this didn't do anything for me. I didn't have any adverse effects from using it, just nothing positive, either."
4,Hilarious,"Funny throughout, but for the hardcore fan, one would find it a bit too made up. Great overall entertainment value."
4,Ralph Rocks!,"I got this book as a gift for a friend, and in looking over it it seems to be pretty good. Some of the stuff is made up (hasn't been in the Simpsons) but it is still pretty funny."
3,"Poorly Packaged, Arrived Damaged","Overall, I like the look of the Swissmar Montblanc Fondue set. However, when it arrived at my door with broken condiment cups, dents on the wooden board, and a chip out of the enamel, it was hardly the quality I was expecting. I thought the condiment cups were on the cheap side (at least one arrived intact), but the rest of the set was nice enough. I sent it back for a replacement which Amazon made convenient, but I have been waiting nearly 2 1/2 months for a replacement! I think you'll be happy with this product IF you get it, but I'm beginning to think that's a big IF!"
2,"Long, but not useful","The cable is very long, but will not charge a USB-powered device due to it's length. It would have been nice to know this going in, so hopefully this helps someone else."
2,Did not work for me.,"This did not work for me.I contacted Amazon; and as always were very helpful and were willing to give me a full refund.I purchased the Amazon Basics Version, which appears to be better quality and it works very well!"
2,A cute introduction to crystals,"This is a novel approach to divination with crystals, but unless you have a lot of patience, this system does not offer much room to grow into proficiency.The guidebook is better reserved for its introduction to the 12 crystals included in this kit."
1,NOT YET RECEIVED,I can not write anything as I am still waiting for this product. I ordered it in August 2006 and we are not in November 2006!
1,Not Much of a Case,"My mom got this for my son to hold his toy cars. It has room for only 4 cars and a ""charger"" that probably doesn't exist anymore. It's probably cool for collectors, but it's not functional for actually storing more than 4 cars. We may use it as a lunchbox since it'll cost money to return it."
1,Terrible quality,These safety pins are weak and bend easily. I am very disappointed. I thought going with Singer would guarantee good quality. Apparently not. Don't but them.P.S. My 20+ year old safety pins are at least twice as strong as these.
5,Interesting and emotional,I found this book very intersting and vivid. The poems were very unique and showed much emotion from the author. You get to see the author through the poems. They are written in a very different sort of style. I like this book very much and recommend it to other people.
5,Way to go DJ,I did not just give this book 5 stars becuase the author is a great friend of mine. i gave 5 stars becuase of the emmense feeling and love that is seen in each of the poems written by DJ. His heart is bared with each writing. Its a wonderful book which has graced my desk since it came out. From a writter so passionate about life so is he about his poems.... its a great book and should be read by all.
4,Good Product,This is a very good product and something I will continue to use when working out or for a quick meal.
1,only for true fans,"This game sucks! there is a stupid story line. you can not save your game so you have to start all over when you stop the game. also there are no instructions but ""a real man doesn't need instructions"" haha so anyway only a true fan like me would get this even though the game itself is horrible."
1,"This game need the ""Improvement""",when i purchased this game years ago i tried it out the game itself made pretty much no sense and it strayed from the plot of the actual show it was more boring than Et for the atari(well maybe not cuz that game sucked worse)but still it took me a few tries before i tried to see the instruction manual to get how to played the game and guess what it said Real Men don't need instruction Manual i was thinking What the heck it's a freaking Kids game that's when i just sold the game at a garage sale for [...] buck's trust me before buying this game online i consider watching review video's on youtube or check the wikipedia wiki the guys who say it's a great game for kid's are lier's it has 10% to do with the real sitcom home improvement and like i said on the Title This game needs the improvement!!!!! (i bought the game at Toys ' Us in 1995) take this from me the game is PLAIN boring do not buy this!
1,never received the game,first you said you had it and would mail it to me and i would receive this game in a certain amount of days. then you e-mail me back saying you no longer have the game any more. thanks.
1,Terrible,"This thing is unbelievably lame. It doesn't massage. It vibrates. Y'all have sat in massage chairs before at Sharper Image or Brookstone. They can be really good, with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage.This thing doesn't even resemble those chairs. Trust me. I am sitting in one now. It is my main office chair. I have not turned on the ""massage"" function, or even plugged it in, since about three days after I bought it.The ""massage"" feature is more like an annoy feature. It just shakes you around a bit, but doesn't actually feal good in any way."
1,Four Motor Motion Sickness Vibrator,"Amazon should provide rating less than 1, like a 0 or -1. I would have rated this -1 or even lesser.Its not a massage chair, its a VIBRATOR Chair. As soon as I got the delivery, I started charging, but it only took 10 secs to know its vibrating instead of massaging. Immediately switched of , packed and returned. Its too good to be true that they're selling a massage chair for around $80 unless its a crap. I would go for one of those portable shiatsu massage."
5,Great Desk Chair,"I received this chair very quickly, even though it was close to Christmas. The chair was wonderful! Such a great price for such a great chair!"
1,Dont ever try to buy electronic related comfort products without feeling them,I spent nearly 3 hours in trying to assemble the chair and found out in the end that there were 2 screws missing. So spent again 3 more hours disassembling it. Go to a physical shop and buy comfort products. Never buy online. You will suffer the pain i went through
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought two, one was broke on arrival and the other was flimsey. I do not recommend this product. Pay a little more and get a higher quality."
2,It broke with first usage,I bought this rack for a friend and used it while visiting. It held my almost empty bag for 2 weeks. When I started filling it for the return trip the leg broke. Don't put 40 pounds on that luggage rack. It won't hold it. It's interesting that the one view supplied with luggage on the rack is a piece identical to the one that broke it.
2,rack needed a quick fix,"All was as expected on this convenience product. However, the rack became detached from the frame during shipping. In the end, I ended up using crazy glue to fix it as my guests were expected soon. Not a big problem but a disappointment."
2,looks nice but breaks,"I picked up a few of these from a national chain store. They look nice and fold well, but one broke and I'm not sure if the others will hold up.... They aren't the best made so a heavy suitcase that is put down with any force will likely break this rack."
2,Lightweight Luggage Only,"When I purchased two of the Winsome Wood Luggage Racks, I thought I was getting a great deal. BUT, when I took them out of the boxes, I thought one of the racks was broken. Upon examining it, I discovered that one of the legs wasn't even attached to the frame. My husband had to screw the leg into the frame. When we set them up and put a piece of luggage (lightweight) on each, both began to wobble. He actually added some screws for extra support to each, before we could even use them. I wish the weight limit had been posted in the description of the product before I purchased them. Don't buy them unless you are handy and can add a finishing touch to them."
3,Luggage (C)Rack,"Item arrived speedily and most efficiently. As stated, it was in good condition but used. It was also damaged, one lath was detached (maybe in transport?) and it needed raul plugs in order to be fixed and useable. Still I was pleased to have it since I needed it. Thanks."
2,Disappointed,"Although I haven't taken the exam yet to evaluate the material, the book is filled with numerous grammatical errors which makes it very hard to concentrate on the actual material. There are a number of run on and incomplete sentences, as well as numerous other mistakes. At this point, I guess its better than nothing."
1,don't buy this!,there aren't many options for CSET science study books out there. This one was overpriced and had a ton of errors/inaccuracies!
5,Collar for Life,"This collar is of the highest quality leather and craftsmanship. Some of the outstanding features of this collar are the thick, flexible leather and the individual, screw-back metal studs. Great communication with vendor. Vendor will customize collars!"
3,Not as good as the original,"This game is not as fun an experience as the original Genghis Khan on NES. Instead of the menu options being in words they are in pictures that can hardly be distinguished from each other, never mind being able to discern what kind of menu option they are supposed to represent. Combat is also not improved, as the squares with numbers from the original game are replaced by little men that look like refugees from Dragon Warrior on the NES. This game is not an improvement on the original as far as I am concerned - it is rather a regression."
4,Its really a good game once you understand it,Theres some reason why the game is hard to find for a cheap price. The previous reviewer apparently did not give this game time. I really enjoy this game and have to say my only gripe is the lack of memory to save more than one game per conquest. The battle graphics could have been better (thats if you have that option on). Overall this is a very enjoyable strategy game but you have to really understand the game. IF you can try to find a manual (not a cheatbook .. Im a throwback so we never use those!!) ..
5,One of the better romances of the year,"Alison's Journey written by very talented story-teller Amey S. Tippett is a wonderful read. This great story is of a young woman smart enough to walk away from her painful past and start a new, brighter future. The main character, Alison, walks away from her very rich lifestyle and all of it's horrible nightmares and embraces the brighter future she finds in a smaller, saner world. Along the way she overcomes the many obstacles of the world as well as within her own self.I found this to be a truly inspiring read and a well planned story that encompasses many areas of emotional and personal growth. This wonderful book is not only an inspirational piece but a gripping love story as well. I felt myself being captivated by the story, the characters, and the wonderful town that Alison now calls home. I would recommend this book as one of the better releases of the year.Tessa Crigger- Author of I Hear Gaea's Tears"
4,Alison's Journey,"After fleeing her abusive husband, Alison gets as far as Ohio when her car breaks down. Fortunately, the small town in which she finds herself stranded welcomes her with open arms. Her new landlady refers her to her brother, Tyler, to fix the broken car, little imagining that Tyler will repair Alison's broken heart. Over the next few months, Alison finds work, friends, and the joy she thought she had lost. Tyler's entire family becomes hers, yet fear of her husband lingers. As her divorce's finalization comes closer, the man becomes determined to regain his wife, and Tyler wants to know where he stands with Alison. Haunted and tormented by her past, Alison is unable to see what the future holds. Is Ty's love strong enough to wait?**** The journey Alison makes from victim to victor is heartwarming. Love's power is clearly seen throughout the book. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,upper rack,"Although these are Weber Brand, they are not stainless steel and will rust out quickly. I ended up just removing them and tossing them in the trash."
1,Wrong Size,"This item was too long for our grill. We requested an alternative unit. The vendor offered to get the correct item, but has yet to ship the right item or send return instructions for the one we received."
2,Weber 3631 Warming Rack,"The warming rack is useful only on a shelf above a gas grill. Unfortunately, neither a photograph nor an explanation was supplied by Amazon, rendering the product useless for my charcoal grill."
4,Steiner Jelly Whip,I tried the Steiner Jelly Whip when I was on my Alaskan cruise and bought my first bottle. When I cm hone had to have another bottle is a great product
3,fun but hard work,My 6 year old daughter loves this but gets very frustrated with it also. the beads are not seperated so she has to hunt for the right color and if you bump the table she's working on beads go roling and she has to start over. It has been fun for us thow.
5,Neat Item!,"Our daughter received this a gift, she's the crafty type, so it was totally up her alley. The package itself is easy to open for little ones. Pieces are small (ei, messy)..I had my daughter take a couple handfuls and place them in a rectangle dish so she can easily choose what colors she'd like to use without making a huge mess. A grown-up is needed for the ironing part, but outside of that, any crafty child would love the possibilities of this product. Our only mistake with this, we didn't purchase additional peg boards and our local Toys R Us does not have this in stock currently."
4,Kids love it,"Kids love it and it's great for their creative little minds... but be prepared to find those little pieces every where in your house. They don't hurt quite as much as stepping on a Lego, but a close second... Definitely worth the buy at least once for the kids."
2,Mediocre account,"This book is marred by a cluttered prose and some careless editor work. The subject matter does have some interest. Yet, the treatment is far from ideal - there are places that the author lingers on for too long while on the other hand there's gaps in the narrative that should have been filled. The quality of research is mediocre."
2,Too clumsy!,"You can definitely hold anything hot from the oven with these mitts. However, they are so inflexible and make it very hard to get a good grip when removing hot dishes etc. from the oven. It is easier for me to do it old style - use my old mitt and a folder tea towel - as I least I have more control over removing and holding any hot dishes. I stopped using these mitts after the first week or so."
2,Not of Good Quality,"When I received these mitts, they were cute-n-all... but be careful. The Heat resistance FEELS like 300F capacity instead of 400F... but who am I to say...[my fingers] that's all. I am just very cautious when touching heat. Finally PLEASE DONT WASH THEM!!! After carefully following the care instructions for washing, the end product came out horrible. The mitts faded, the size shrunk and the cotton interior puffed OUT like a blowfish."
1,Not a fan,These are almost too ridged and you can still feel the heat through them a bit. I'm just not a fan of them at all.
3,Not bad,"I like that they are long but they are incredibly stiff to the point that it impedes on flexibility. Still, I find them to be resistant to heat. Also the green is a nice colour and pastel almost."
2,Very resistant to heat but too stiff for me,"What I like about these mitts are the extra long sleeves. According to the description they are 17 inches but mines are actually a shade under 16.5 inches. I know that's a slight nitpick but I just thought I would point that out. The other good thing is that compared to my old mitts I can hardly feel the heat at all. That being said, they are so stiff that it makes it difficult to handle the hot items. I nearly dropped a dish while I was pulling it out of the oven. I very well could've burned myself pretty badly. I've gotten used to them after using them for a short while but I'm probably going to buy some different ones the next time I go to the store."
4,These run small,The shoes were okay ... but the size runs small so I am giving them to a friend who wears one size smaller than I do. I wore them once but could not comfortabally wear them. I usually wear 8 1/2 or 9 and these were size 9 but still too small for me.
5,"Best shoes, ever!","I have had five pairs of the Brooks Addiction Walkers and they are the greatest shoes made. Brooks put its money into making it's shoes better and not making the execs richer. They break in quickly and then you may not want to take them off. Only two shoes to buy, Brooks or New Balance. I chose the Brooks and I am not sorry."
3,its allright,"decent album, not very original, they blow nuts live, and it is terribly overproduced. there are some pretty sick breakdowns though so that's why i give it 3 stars. i hope this isn't the future of hardcore."
4,Andromeda anybody????,"Aimless Endeavor's intro was stolen from Hopesfall's Andromeda, the first track on the masterpiece, Satillite Years (Those of you diised it, are idiots, sorry but it must be said). Check out both, it's about half way through Andromeda, and tell me what you think. I don't really feel like writing a review, but its a good CD and Beloved is a good band, and may they Rest in Peace (they played there last show a week or two ago).By the way, if anybody has listened to Hopesfall, how do you not notice?"
4,screamo hardcore mixed,only are faces hide and aimless enceaver are to of the best song you can ever hear. they have that in your face sound but thet are very emo or screamo as well.its sadd that they decided to call it quits they were good
4,For the people sick of fake emo-core(thursday),"definitely one of the stand outs in my collection.this album to me is Emocore to the fullest.unlike ""Thursday""(who are concidered one of the top emocore bands)Beloved actually has elements of emo and hardcore.the guitar parts are intricate and beautiful and wrap around devistating metal parts in a poetic way that is only matched by the amazing vocals. i strongly recommend this album for anyone who has become weary of the mindless power-cord strumming and teen-angst moanings that seem to have saturated todays market."
2,Buyer Beware!,"If you grew up with this album, as I did, and have fond memories of it, then wait until Chrysalis/Capitol/EMI get around to remastering it (with bonus tracks). This import is from Holland and the sound is totally dead! It sounds like it was recorded in the next room through a brick wall.Let's also acknowledge that Ian's muse (Baker St. and otherwise) was just about shot by this time. Songs from the Wood, Heavy Horses and Bursting Out were huge successes. Stormwatch was less so but still has its moments. By ""A"" IA is singing about ""Uniforms"" and batteries for his children's toys! The music is also totally different - more synthesizer and violin - kind of techno. If your a Tull completist, then get it by I regret not waiting for the remastered reissue. Maybe they will reissue Stormwatch and Bursting Out also."
1,a fiasco,"don't be fooled by this...this import from Holland is NOT a remastered version of Jethro Tull's ""A""...very disappointing...I can wait for the EMI remastered version of this great album!"
3,alien,"this cd is like Under Wraps album, you love or hate the sound. I like it a lot because the live concert were fresh and happy... One important think, i told Dave Rees the man of the fanzine of Jethro Tull-A New Day- this CD is not yet remastered."
4,Addictive,"I haven't yet come across a Richard Scarry story/video I didn't like. I purchased this because my daughter actually watched the other one until the tape broke! The characters are sweet, the storyline is engaging, there's a lesson to learn and always a happy ending."
4,Quality Boots,"This boot is a great deal for the money and will go great for a professional shoe or dressed down with a pair of jeans. the toe of the boot is a little more square than the picture shows but it is nice without looking too ""metrosexual"". I would recommend this shoe to anyone that has a business casual dress code in a professional office, or for an everyday alternative to sneakers."
5,Perfect Sized Bag for College Football Stadiums...,"Some college football stadiums do not allow backpacks of any kind (even backpacks that are obviously camera backpacks) into their venues. This bag passes the ""8.5 x 11"" bag size restriction at some of those stadiums, and it still has room for an extra lens. As always, the Lowepro quality is superb."
5,Love it!,"I use this bag for my Sony Alpha. It's awesome. Love the built-in ""raincoat"" and all the extra pockets. It's not big enough for extra lenses, but it's great for my most common uses."
3,Slick design but doesn't offer enough space.,"This camera bag has a neat design to it with the top opening away from you and the flap stays out of the way. It also provides a nice rain shield that covers the entire bag and is nicely stored in the back flap. The microfiber cloth is sewed to the bag with makes it difficult to clean your lenses and wash the cloth itself. I bought this bag for my Nikon D3100 SLR camera with 2 lenses, and unfortunately the bag did not fit these three items comfortably. I could not keep the basic 18-55mm lens attached to my camera and store it with my other lens. The only way to fit all three items is to stack a lens on top of the camera and other lens. For this price, I would say this camera bag is not worth the money. I opted for a slightly larger Nikon brand camera bag that offered more room (I can store my camera with a lens attached), better protection and best of all, was almost half the price of this lowepro camera bag."
3,a little small,"I tried to fit my digital SLR and 1 lens and a battery charger and they wouldn't all fit. I also tried to put my lens hoods in place of the charger and still wouldn't fit, so I sent it back and bought a larger bag."
2,Fabric starts to disintegrate,"The bag served its purpose for carrying our Canon Rebel camera, but after a a couple of years, we are now finding that part of the fabric is breaking down and flaking off. This is mainly just the fabric that is over the triangular area on the top flap. Its gets all over the carpet, on clothes, etc... just a mess every time we take the camera in and out of the bag. Currrently looking for a new bag that wont make a mess."
3,OK until it broke,"Worked fine until the plastic clip on one of the straps snapped, sending my D7000 plummeting to the ground. The lens filter on both my 50mm 1.8 and 18-200mm smashed, thankfully the glass was fine. Zipper also came loose. I'll get one that's a little more durable next time, although it wasn't awful."
5,A very handy gadget bag,"Excellent gadget camera bag for a SLR camera with extra lenses, flash light. Will recommend it for the novice photographer"
1,Not Large Enough,"This bag was described as being able to hold a camera and 2 lenses or camera, lense, and flash. The bag is smaller than most lunch boxes, and barely holds my 35mm SLR w/ a 28-80 mm lense. I thought about using it to hold my flash and lenses, but it is too small to fit my flash. I would not reccomend this bag."
5,It Works,"I've used PhosFree for years to keep phosphates low in my pool, and it works very well. But the best news is the price. Way way less expensive than Leslie's, where I have usually gotten it. Will continue to buy it here if the price says the same--and free shipping to boot."
5,Phos free works,"Phosfree works to remove phosphates from the water.I have used this product for over 3 years and have had no alge problems. I live in the Phoenix Arizona area and alge is a problem here due to high water temp. and high U.V.I recomend Phosfree to all my friends, to keep their pools alge free."
3,Not as concentrated as the description says,"I just received my bottle of chemical, so have not used it yet (it's to replace a different brand that I used up). As phosphate removers go, I'm sure it works well. However, the item description here is incorrect. One needs to use much more than 4 oz per 8000 gal. Here's the blurb from the back of the bottle:DOSE PER 10,000 gallons (38,000 L)(I can't figure out how to do a table, sorry about the formatting)Phosphate level (ppb):::PHOSfree300 or less ::: 0.5 L or 16 oz600 ::: 1 L or 32 oz900 ::: 1.5 L or 48 ozThe professional strength stuff might be more economical in the long run!"
1,1 out of 5 stars Not as concentrated as the description says,"This product did not work for me, save your $$$$ did not removed the phosphate on the pool, very weak product."
4,Keep phosphates below 100 ppm,"While it does not reduce phosphates to zero, it's pretty darn close! Buying from this seller you save nearly 50% from what the local pool supply charges for the exact same product. Use this on a regular basis to keep phosphates low, add an algae control product and you won't have to worry about algae! Highly recommend product and seller!"
3,commercial strength is a better deal than this,"Commercial strength phos free is a better deal for your money. It costs twice as much, but will be good for much longer.Natural Chemistry 05235 Pool Perfect Concentrate and Phos Free Pool Cleaner, 2-Liter"
1,Disappointed...Again?,"I have used this product three (3) times with similar results. Small, almost negligable reduction in Phosphates. Certainly not worth the cost or effort. One Pool Technician told me not to worry about phosphates as long as you keep your chlorene levels reasonably high. Lots of psyco-chemical chatter stating that phosphates feed on algae and you need this chemical and that chemical but my sense is spend the money on chlorene and don't worry about the phosphates."
1,It did not work - Porduct was leaking....,It did not work - Porduct was leaking and it looked like it had been opened and re-sealed. Never again.
1,Never received item,I ordered this item on April 14. Today is May 15th. Never received the item. Cancelled my order today and ordered elsewhere. Will never order from these folks again.
1,Doesn't work for me at all,"First of all, I have to make it clear, that I purchaged PhosFree in my local store instead of Amazon.This product ""PhosFree"" totally doesn't work for me. It damaged my DE filter completely, so I have to replace whole set of DE filter grids, spent about $200 to make pump system work.""PhosFree"" blocked my DE filter when I used it in first time, even I extactly followed the instruction NC provided. When filter was blocked I consulted their customer service, was told that I can try Commercial version of ""PhosFree"", I trusted them and tried it, but it was even worse. My whole pump system doesn't work at all, whole pool was covered by green algae after 3 days. I called a poolman, he told me that he has other 3 customers have same problem, there is only one way to resolve it, that is to replace whole set of filter grides.I strongly suggest DO NOT use this product ""PhosFree"" in your swimming pool if you are using a DE filter."
5,Algie fighter,"I used this product in the past, but I now purchase it thru Amazon for less then the pool supply store."
3,Who discovered this Guy?,"Whoever discovered this guy, I would love to shake their hand. This guy is awesome. There is so much packed into the lyrics of these songs. I hope he continues to keep his focus."
3,It's OK,"I purchased this album before amazon offered the music sampler. I bought this cd because I really loved one of the songs. I figured that there had to be something else on the cd that would take my breath away. . . umm . . . not quite! The songs began to sound the same after awhile, and it left me feeling dissatisfied. After playing it several times, it sort of grew on me; but, I would definitely recommend that you--the consumer--listen to the music sampler before purchasing!"
5,"Beautiful, Acoustic and Soulful Debut","This CD is so beautiful to listen to, and very impressive both musically and in a faith inspiring way. Shawn projects emotion that is both real and mature for such a young artist. I typically like one-off's from various Christian artists, but this is honestly the first time I've been so inspired by one artist as to buy their CD versus a compilation of top hit songs. There is not a song on this CD that I don't like, but I particularly like track 4, 5, and 8 as well as the often-played track 2, Gravity. Soothe your aching soul...listen to this CD!"
1,The WORST kind of History,This book had me fooled for about 100 pages then the 'agenda' became clear! I love TR and recommend Edmund Morris bio - real history and writing. Carry a Big Stick distorts distorts the fact and TR himself to fit into a RIGHT WING agenda - Grant comments on FDR are SHAMEFUL and incorrect. PLEASE READ SOMETHING ELSE!
2,Right wing revisionist history,This at first appears to be a short well written comprehensive story of Teddy Roosevelt's life. It turns out to be a right wing evangelicalchristian propaganda piece. Actual facts are interspersed with falsestatements to influence the reader on modern social issues which haveno place in an objective scholarly work. Do not read this book if youwant a fair and balanced picture.
2,Biased -- Better Stuff Available,"I just wanted a simple biography on Theodore Roosevelt, but this was pretty openly and obviously a book with an agenda. True, the basics about Theodore Roosevelt are here, but the emphasis is on spiritual faith and values. Since I read this book, I read Roosevlet's autobiography and came to realize that he is much more complex than this book suggests."
4,I prefer their new one...,They released fresh in 2004 which i think is a better album. They dont have it at amazon unfortunately.if you like Yours to keep you should get Paola's solo album Stockcity girl. It is one of the best in a long time...Alas you have to get it from overseas...
3,you get what you pay for,"Of course, this is not the best webcam, but it is the lightest and easiest to carry around and install. I did not have any trouble installing it with Windows XP, and honestly, for the price, I cannot complain. You cannot expect a great resolution. It is a nice little toy."
3,Hook,The game was a little bit hard and boring. Not really what I expected it to be. That's ok on to the next game I guess.
4,Well Done,"This book is about the growth of the garment workers' unions and the place within that growth that the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe took. It was well-written, well-researched. Were I a history professor looking for a informative additional text regarding the turn of the Twentieth Century, I believe I would put this book on the top of the list."
4,GREAT Product,"I had a lesser model that just wouldn't charge any more so I purchased this one. In comparrison, they are exactly the same. The only difference is the digital front face and outside cover. The only negative reason that I couldn't rank it as a five is the price. Take my advise. This is one great product but is very pricey. Go for the more inexpensive floating head shaver. (The shape of all of their float heads are the same. It's the same product. Just different packaging. Get the cheaper one.)I really had a difficut time trying to adjust back to a blade while I was waiting for this to arrive and it really made me realize how good this product is.By the way, I opened up the older one and found that there was some water that got in and probably was shorting the charging system. After drying it and letting it sit open for a day, she works just as good as before. Now I have a back-up."
2,Battery only holds one shave after 1.5 years and battery not replaceable,"I recently replaced this with a Philips/Norelco 7310XL, which was about half the price. The Panasonic's battery lasted only 1.5 years and that with using it only 3 to 4 times a week. The battery can not be easily replaced as far as I could determine (nor could I find a battery online to buy). Now, this unit holds a charge for only 1 shave and without a plug-in back up, I'm stuck using my manual razor if I run long. Going forward, I will not buy another induction based charging system, due to this problem.The unit is also noisier than the the new Philips model with the 3 circular blade system. The shave was fairly close for me, but the Philips is just a touch better."
3,Nice Wet shaver but not so close...,"I mainly purchased this shaver for being able to use during the showering.It is great that you can get this wet and soaked for shaving and for cleaning. However, shaving quality is OK at best. It does not give you a real close shave that you have give a few passes. My older Braun give better close shaving then this. This is a OK shaver if you want to use it during showering but you will need to use a mirror to check if everything is shaved properly."
1,panasonic es8096,I bought this shaver for over$135.00 about 18months ago.I have been using electric shavers for over 30years.I never bought shaver so expensive yet so bad.It had two repairs under warranty and as soon as warranty exires so did shaver.It started to go down in piece meal and now it is complety dead.What a usless products from a large conglomerate?I will not recommand this products even for $20.00 and if you still decide to buy it goodluck.
4,the challenge of a lifetime,"It seems everyone who grew up with the Super NES will have memories of Super Ghouls and Ghosts, and particularly, the extreme difficulty. My memory of the game is somewhat blurry, and short. In fact I only ever played the game once. To no one's surprise, I lost in a few seconds. BUT, it didn't seem like the hardest game ever made or anything. According to people I've talked to, I had to play the game for about an hour and THEN I'd realize the game was impossibly hard.It's fascinating how the difficulty hasn't stopped the game from becoming a classic. When I talk to people about the Super NES Super Ghouls and Ghosts ALWAYS comes up. You just don't forget a game like this."
2,So very boring,"If you are looking for a sensationalist true crime type of book, look elsewhere. This book is a rather dry read, filled with professorial slang. It's also very, almost offensivley feminist. According to the author, women get heavier sentences than men (incredibly false. Most women recieve far lighter sentences than men for the same crimes). And women only kill because centuries of opression and women hating and abuse brought them to it, which many know is false. As a woman, I found myself far more offended than intrigued. There is a fine line between feminism and degredation. The tone implies that all women are victims of society, incapable of being sociopathic. Isn't that a very sexist tone, that women are incapable of violence and are suited to drinking tea and shopping? Overall, too dry and stuffy for me."
1,Not Worth Reading.,"This book has one bit of information about the Dark Angels that is revealing. But it's lost in an utterly unbelieveable and contrived story. The innterogation scenes were menotonus and repetative. The actual action was nothing but average. The plot is simplistic and contrived and the ""twist"" at the end is laughable. Instead of trying to stun us with a ""shocking"" ending Thorpe could have actually developed characters and stuck to material in the first chapters about recuitment etc it would have been much better. Instead we get The ""Emperor's Finest"" playing Keystone cops. The Dark Angels in this book are portrayed as overly emotional, short sighted, rash and basicly stupid. If Thope's Dark Angel's are indicative of the finest The Imperium has to offer then I'm heading for the nearest Eldar craftworld."
5,Love this item!,"This is a sturdy, nice sized basket tree for my Longaberger baskets. It fits nicely in the corner of my breakfast room & holds 8 baskets."
2,Not for men with BIG fingers,Trouble with no signal when other Tmobile phones have great signal & keypad is really small causing text troubles & switching between modes of typing unless you have tiny fingers.Only better than average feature id 1.3 mega pixels pictures and video if you can transfer them & find software to edit and update phonebook??My next has to be the Apple IPhone for BIG Finger!!
1,Do not Buy this Phone!!!,"This is one of the worst phones, i have had it for a month and i have desided to upgrade already to the T-mobile Wing, it is a ""dumb"" phone, the music player is very slow and it is not organized alphabeticly, the batery is very bad, it will last 4 hrs if your using the music, camara is decent if there is good lighting because the light dosen't work, your pictures will come out very white if you use it, the color is better than it looks online, not much to do with this phone, i would not recommend it!!!"
4,"Good, Well made phone","This is a pretty cool phone, except that it sometimes looks purple.The camera is great and you can take pics with it sideways. There are many different settings for it. The phone and the programs and stuff are pretty slow, but who cares? The music player supports many different formats, which is nice. The flash is really bright. It hurts my eyes. The speaker is pretty good. The screen could use a better resolution, though.My screen got a bunch of tiny little pieces of dirt in it, but T-Mobile replaced it right away.It feels indestructible, but i wouldn't go and see if that's a true statement.I would buy it. It is a good deal."
2,"Lots of features, lousy voice quality","As far as features go, this is a nice phone with a 2 MP camera, music player, removable micro SD card and ready access from a PC. However, it fails to deliver when it performs its primary function: as a phone. Its voice quality is much below average and the speaker phone sounds like someone just cranked up the earpiece a wee bit. Being on the Tmobile network makes matters worse in my area where I have marked specific areas in my house to run to to make/receive calls."
3,A very fragile phone.,"I bought this phone five months ago from T-Mobile. Overall, I think it's a so so phone.Pros: Beautiful and looks cool.Cons:1. Camera quality is not as good as I had thought.2. It makes a sound when you adjusting the ring volume, which is embarrassing if you do this during a meeting.3. Voice dialing is funny. It doesn't associate your voice with a fixed number, but instead, it tries to pick up a name from the contact list based on your voice. The intelligence of the voice recognition is poor and it assumes your contact has an English name.4. Very fragile. I dropped the phone from a place two feet high and it is broken. It keeps resetting and won't come up.I will stay away from Motorola phones from now on."
1,Problems,"After one month blue paint started peeling off phone.According to T-Mobile this is not an ""issue"" & willnot honor warranty."
3,Love this phone!!,"I absolutely loved this phone as soon as i got it. The camera is really great! I am very rough on my phones and this went through a lot of drops/scratches, I have had it for about a year, now and the screen just stopped working. I don't know if it is because of the phone, or if i just drop it too much (I'm telling you I'm really bad) so if you are pretty careful with your phone (or even drop it 2-3 times a week) this phone will be great for you."
2,I wouldn't buy this phone,The screen scratches too easy. Day one I accidently put it in my pocket with my keys and I was all scratched up. And the screen gets way to greasy like another reviewer was saying. Maybe he doesn't shower often either. Ha Ha.
4,Good phone,"I'm 90% happy with the phone. Batteries live long, standard USB slot for charging (not proprietary cables any more, thank God), slightly improved interface. Love the way it slides, my sliding Samsung did it with less reassuring feel.10% of unhappiness is due to the fact that it looses signal in places where some of my friends' phones don't. Also, dust gets between a screen and a protective glass."
2,Not the best,"I've had my phone for several months. The camera on this phone was excellent, and I generally had no problems with the sound quality or reception. Unfortunately, the central button (which is used for EVERYTHING) came unglued several times and was recently lost for good on a run. The warranty will not cover a replacement or repair, so I'm left to choose whether I want to deal with a sticky, broken, hard-to-use phone, improvise a DIY duct tape/aluminum fix, or shell out money for a brand new cell. I'm very disappointed in Motorola's lack of responsibility for a clear design flaw, and will not likely purchase another Motorola phone."
3,"Solid, well-written, a bit predictable.","This is a well-written, well-paced action story which is not particularly novel or original, which is an enjoyable read but is of little true value. If you have enjoyed the first 5 books of this sub-series detailing the early years of Captain Picard on the Stargazer, you will probably enjoy this one, but I wouldn't read it if you haven't read and enjoyed its predecessors. If you haven't read them, then you will find this book somewhat confusing as it refers back to events from previous books rather heavily; if you haven't enjoyed them, there is no reason to think that your reaction to this book will be any different."
3,Lonely Planet Taiwan,"This book was better than the National Geographic Traveler: Taiwan book that I bought for the same trip. A pretty comprehensive guide book that called out most of the important sites, hotels and restaurants. However, I felt the authors could have done a better job of highlighting more of the local eateries and explaining more about the local culture. The book also included maps, which were helpful."
3,"good product, slow shipping",I needed this product right away and paid around $30 for expedited shipping and it took almost a week for it to arrive.
5,mini bag,"Fastest shipping I have ever received on any product! It's a cute bag- fits my netbook. Good padding, well constructed. Good quality."
2,Disappointed and surprised,"I am returning this book because although it looked like it had creative ideas and received very good reviews, I didn't feel it would serve the purpose I had intended which was to have a book I could give my 6 and 12 year olds to look through to choose a costume.There were too many costume suggestions that I don't think are appropriate for kids - like a ""Mammy"" costume, a ""Vodka Cocktail"" costume and a ""Cigarette Girl"" and ""Bag Lady"" to name a few. Personally, I don't think these are very appropriate for adults either, but I really don't think they are appropriate or in the spirit of fun that I want to promote at Halloween with my kids.I'll be looking for another book that has fun costumes that don't reinforce negative stereotypes."
5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"This is such a fun book for Halloween! I have enjoyed looking at the photographs and illustrations. I can't wait to try some of the creative costumes out on my children. The book makes it so easy to put together and understand! In this day of rush, rush, rush, its so wonderful to have a book that makes life simple. Thank you for such a great tool!"
5,You get what you pay for,"While some aftermarket batteries are somewhat underwhelming in their longevity, this is the gold standard in batteries for your Leica D-lux series camera. Much more expensive, but so is the camera. Excellent performance and it keeps your outfit all Leica.This review was written a few years ago for the real, original Leica replacement battery I received. According to another reviewer for this, a NYC retailer is selling an after-market battery here. Highly disreputable. Another retailer did the same to me by indicating his after-market Leica D-Lux 4 battery was OEM, which it was not. Be very careful when buying replacement digital camera batteries online. The best way is to buy them from a brick and mortar store in person, and check for the Leica brand mark."
3,interesting story told in disjointed way,"I just finished reading Tina S's book and found her story most interesting and the book itself most madning as it is told in such a disjointed, scattered way. For that I blame the co-author professional writer Jamie Bolnick. The entire book is told in endless frustrating flashbacks and flashforwards. And they never say what year or season it is nor give any reason for this change in time or location every 2 to 4 pages. It's so frustrating to read the story this way! It would have been so far superior if it had been told in chronological order (or at least most of it that way)."
5,Nancy Drew Reviews,"This is one of the most moving books I have ever read.I couldn't put it down.It was very depressing at times, and I thought I might not make it through it, but I knew I had to finish....to get some closure to this young woman's journey through hell.If you are out there Tina S., I hope you know what an amazing survivor you are.You deserve to have the best life ever."
2,A dated product.,"This is definetely a dated product. By today's high standards, the graphics look awfully bad. If you are desperate, buy this, but most gamers should not."
1,impractical,"The recipes call for fancy, hard-to find ingredients and are difficult to follow. The book seems to be geared more toward impressing us with the author's knowledge than actually sharing recipes. Also, the ones I've tried haven't come out very well. There are much better vegan cookbooks out there."
5,The BEST vegan cookbook around!,"I have been vegan for 5 years, and I must say, I have never tried a better chocolate chip cookie, vegan or non! Even my siblings, who are picky and critical of vegan food, agree with me! The rest of the recipies in this book are just as amazing. The sheepless shepherd's pie was a delicous entree, and any meal is especially grand topped off with every-day chocolate cake. Despite the name, this no ordinary old cake.If you are looking for the best of vegan chow, I definitely recommend this book!"
2,Can't Make It Work...,"This is a lovely book, full of really well-written and informative sections on nutrition, ingredients, putting menus together, and the recipes all sound wonderful and are easy to follow and well laid-out. However... I've made ten dishes from it, and not a single one turned out very tasty! I've had other cookbooks that produced occasional disappointments, but never one that so consistently left me crestfallen! So, while I really wanted to like this book, I feel I must warn others against it, sorry..."
3,Only if IE 4.0 is your development environment!,"This is probably a great book. I say probably because when I received it I needed to read only a few pages to learn that it is directed at only those who use Internet Explorer 4.0 at their WEB DEVELOPMENT tool. I do not. My gripe is that in the Amazon.Com summary of this book (from the publisher) they fail to mention this very important fact. If you are looking for a comprehensive book on Dynamic HTML, and you do not use IE 4 as your development application, you will probably find this book a disappointment."
4,Excellent Coverage of DHTML,This book is very good. It covers cross-browser web solutions very nicely. Breaks down every piece of the code for easy understanding. I recommend this book to webmasters who develop for Netscape and Microsoft browsers.
1,Disappointing,I can't believe this book was ever published. The writing is vague. If the authors/editors understood their subject matter they should be able to explain it. Very disappointing. Writing too vague for a beginner; too brief for an intermediate.
2,Dont bother with this book,"Hey dont even bother with this book. It is a complete waste of a tree unless you are a complete beginner and love Bill Gates. (cuz they will try and brainwash u). Basically, this book says here is a cool dhtml property that works in exploder but not the other ones please look at the microsoft web page or look at the cd that comes with this to see it.What a pile of trash.We want to be able to have a book that can use both netscape and explorer. Not say what netsape4 cant do. Anyways netscape 6 is already out in alpha and this book is completely out of date. Plus this book was written before ie5 so it doesnt even address the newest ie correctly. it was written when it was in beta and he really doesnt have a good understanding of the power. He only knows netscape 4 doesnt have it.The reader is left to do all his homework going to netscapes main page to see what can work.If u want to learn dhtml buy danny goodman and jeff rouyers books!"
2,for non-programmers who has never heard of DHTML,"This book assumes that you have never programmed before and never heard of DHTML. With this assumption in mind, it waste the first half of the book with very, very basic (basic!) material. However, if you are the total novice, this is a well written book for you with a slant toward Microsoft Technology. If you are an intermediate scripter, you won't learn much at all."
5,Great book for learning,"Very well written. The writer has a knack of making some complex topics easy to understand. I've found some of the samples really useful, like the expanding menu code and the cookie reading/writing code (that works back in IE3, unlike most of the other code I tried). Excellent conceptual coverage of javascript. Really good coverage of HTML and CSS too. I have not used some of the cool stuff he talks about later in the book (like behaviors and the media controls) because I have to make most of my code work in really old browsers. The section on browser detection has been useful."
4,"on the whole, not bad","I got the book in a decent amount of time, and there are no pages missing or huge damaged sections or anything like that. A few sections have writing in, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfectly new. I definitely got my money's worth out of the purchase."
5,best of the how-to books,"Best canoeing book on the market. Not only is it a great how to guide on canoe handling, it is an excellent read for those long winter nights for the canoe enthusiast. The book imparts Bill Mason's love of the canoe. Written by a true legend in canoeing and wilderness film making."
3,"Enjoyable, yet too 80's","Wow was my first word when i heard this over five years ago. However I put it back in again after several years of neglect and was resoundingly disapointed. Many of these songs are too 80's-ish to spark my imagination. I still enjoy ""fallen on hard times"" and ""slow marching band"". At appropriate moments in my life, the lyrics come rolling back into my head. The rest are adequate but if you listen to them alot, the inaneness prompts one to throw the cd out the window karate style. Not a disc for beginners, but for die hards, please don't pass this one up."
2,We Disagree On This One,"I am probably the only Jethro Tull fan (who owns every one of Tull's 30 plus releases) who doesn't like this CD much. 'The Clasp' is a song that puzzles me. Ian's voice has been distorted and keyboards seem to dominate the sound. Same for 'Flying Colours.' They just don't sound like Jethro Tull songs at all.High Points (just so I don't anger too many Broadsword fans): 'Falling on Hard Times' is good. Though 'Watching You, Watching Me' sounds a bit 'un-Jethro Tullish,' its a good song.Maybe I just need to listed to this CD again and I will understand what the other TullHeads have been enjoying all these years. Until then, I give the CD 2 stars."
5,Broadsword Shows Broad Talent,I wore out the original tape I had of this album. Broadsword shows the varied and rich range of the band's ability. These guys aren't afraid to take chances. What's more the pull it of in grand style. Bravo!
4,...timely in 2007,"Due to the superior musicianship of the band Jethro Tull, it is very difficult to label them. Some writers will say that TULL was the first alt-rock band. While others rely on the term, prog-rock. With BROADSWORD you just get music that is still timely after two decades. The track titled ""The Clasp"", comes to mind. Here the seeming lack of tolerance by political elites is examined. And the title track, ""Broadsword"", here, just turn up the volume and you are right there, in battle, fighting the British Redcoats on the bloody battlefields of the Scottish Highlands. So don't delay any longer, this CD belongs in the collection of any self-respecting JETHRO TULL fan."
4,My Favourite Tull,"Never a great fan of the original Tull albums (with some great songs however), this has remained on my play list for almost 20 years. The rock/blues of the later albums appeals to me. The music to me is so enjoyable because of the intricate melodies and rhythms. The musicianship is suberb and most of the songs are memorable. None more that 'Seal Driver', 'Fallen on Hard Times', 'Broadsword' and 'Beastie'."
3,3 Stars for Tull is 5 Stars for Most Groups,"True, this is not the best Tull album, having some weaker songs, but then again Flying Colours is one of my favorite Tull tunes of all time. Beastie, The Clasp, Hard Times, Pussy Willow, Seal Driver and, of course, the concert closer, Cheerio, are all excellent tunes. Watching You Watching Me used to drive me batty, but these days I think it's a fairly interesting tune. Broadsword kind of wears on you after awhile. The album's sound quality is not great. The synthesizers do sound a bit dated. I would give this album 4 stars except there are numerous albums by Tull that are better."
3,A ride through stormy skies,"In the 80's, Tull got into technological tricks & synthesizers. This album is, for my money, the best of the period. People who like Tull's folk/Celtic influences will find this album weirdly futuristic-sounding, despite the title. ""Watching You Watching Me"", in particular, sounds completely computerized, but a good song nonetheless. I don't dislike anything on this CD, but ""Clasp"" is the only song I really love. All in all, a very mediocre Tull album, very short, and not very memorable."
1,Doesn't work.,"Doesn't work.Wanted to use this to split optical out into two, one to my receiver and one to my surround headphones with optical input to control box.The split dims the light down, such that neither out would be recognized.Having a background in professional audio, I did some troubleshooting, swapping cables and configurations. Nothing worked.I returned and got a replacement. Repeated everything and still doesn't work."
1,Don't but this,"Only one input works. I have a receiver with one optical input and purchased this in order to use my Satellite receiver and my apple TV. In order to use this I have to unplug one or the other (yes I use one device at a time) piece of crap,"
3,"Worked great, died after 4 months","I am using a Logitech Z-5500 sound system which has one optical input. I was trying to decide what to do to connect both my Playstation 3 & XBox 360 to it, and this was the trinket I used.It worked great. I bought it the first week of Feb 08, but on July 4 it started shorting out while playing music through my PS3. I will be replacing it.Pros: No need to manually swap cables, no noticeable quality loss, small and compact, visually pleasing, no need to manually set input, cheap but effective.Cons: Will only work on one stream - I couldn't have my 360 & PS3 on at the same time, otherwise sound would only come out of whatever I turned on first - really isn't a con - but died after 5 months usage, however cheap to replace."
5,Works great!,"Works excellent, I have it hooked up as a combiner feeding Xbox and PS3 to my sound system, no issues at all! One thing I will mention is that you can't have both devices on at the same time, it's a one or the other unit, in other words not a ""switch"". That's the impression I got from the negative reviews on why it wouldn't work."
2,Cheaply made and doesn't work,"I ordered this as a cheap alternative to an optical switch and this device does not work as advertised. I was hoping to not have to switch a device each time I wanted to play Xbox 360 or PS3. My cables have been tested and work, but one side of this device was broken, so all it really did was act as an extender for an optical cable. Ordering this seems to be a hit or miss. It's a cheap gamble to see if the one you receive actually works or not."
1,does not work,"Well, I wanted it for a 2-into-1, but it doesn't work that way. Doesn't work as a 1-into-2, either. Doesn't work as a 1-into-1 (with electrical tape over the unused dock). Not heavy enough to work as a paperweight. Fits into a garbage can easily, though."
1,Degrades signal strength,This splitter is a poor design as it causes excessive loss of signal strength. I could not get by Bose amp to work when using. Ended buying a TOS switch. Recommend do not buy
1,I have had no luck with this unit.,"I guess this is the case of you get what you pay for. I received this in the mail today (3/17/2012) and was ready to set it up. I plugged in my source cable and plugged in my Astro Gaming Mixamp 5.8 TX puck, and it did not work. I tested all 3 cables to ensure they worked. All 3 cables work. I then switched the splitter around and it still did not work. I did have a laser going across the entire contraption, but no sound. I am not entirely sure why it did not work. I tested this splitter on another device and it did not work there either. This product is busted!"
1,50-50 Chance based on reviews...,"Based on previous reviews, this seemed like one of those items that you order knowing it might not work. This splitter did not work out of the box. You get less than what you pay for."
1,Did not work at all,Did not work at all. Too inexpensive to bother to send it back as it cost less than postage.Would not reccommend.
5,Works as combiner,"It appears results vary between different types of equipment and cable quality/length, but this works fine as a combiner between a TV over a 12' cable and an Apple Airport Express over a 3' cable, into a 3' cable to the Onkyo receiver."
1,not work,not workJust a big lieFraud WarningDo not buy cheap and worth IgrkCautionI bought two pieces are not workingCheats poor equipment without standards or specifications of a good
2,needs work,causes breakup in signal with digital cable (cox) dvr. defiantely not what i was expecting.
5,It works as intented,"If you use this to input two devices and output to one, expect it to act flakey.This is designed to plug one device into it, and split it off to two recievers. IE, your home theatre reciever and a dolby digital headphone reciever."
1,Also failed to wrk for me,"Much like several others, this item did not work for me either. It didn't even work in either direction. This is NOT a substitute for an optical SWITCHER."
1,Didn't work,"This didn't work for me at all. I saw all the reviews and though for 3 dollars, I'll take a chance, and it turns out you get what you pay for. Tried several combinations of cables and equipment but I got zero sound.Works really well at being wedging under the door to keep it from closing, so at least its not a total loss."
1,Does not work,Try to connect a ps3 and a cable box to a Samsung HT in a 2 output to 1 imput it does not work. Cables are ok and individually they work fine.
1,Hunk of JUNK!!,"This switch is garbage. When you hook up all the connections, the single side pops out. Then when I got it to work on one source I would shut it off and started the second source no audio. If you move it, it works for a moment then the connector falls out. Do not waiste your money,they say the item weighs 3lbs. it is about 1 and you are overcharged for shipping."
1,is not compatible..,This item is not compatible with my toshiba HD DVD player or XBox 360.I was very disappointed because my surround sound system only has one optical cable input. I should have researched it more.
1,Does not work.. :(,"Tried to use this to connect a XBOX 360 and a PS3 to a Onkyo HT-S570 5.1 system (has 1 optical input). It did not work. The cables work fine connect to the receiver but not using the splitter. What I found out after playing with it for a bit, is if you move cable around (left to right) it would sometime make a full connection and work, then after you move the cable, it would not work. Only 1 unit was on at a time, and only 1 cable was lit (red light) up. I may have received a bad splitter, but it did not work. Even with just 1 cable plugged into both ends, it could not make a prefect connection. I ended up buying a Onkyo HT-SR700 system from amazon, and it sounds amazing!! (has 2 optical inputs)"
1,Does not work,"I tried using it in the following way: Take output from XBox 360, and split to feed both a surround sound speaker system and surround sound headphones.Here are my speakers: Spherex Xbox 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Systemheadphones: Tritton True 5.1 Digital Audio HeadsetBoth of those products are GREAT by the way.Unfortunately, niether the headphones nor the speakers play after the splitter is put in place, but both work when you switch manually. Further, I checked all the cables independently, and they work fine alone.You get what you pay for!"
3,Small fix; Great value,"I purchased this product to connect a PS3 and an Xbox 360 to a single optical input (the first optical on my receiver was already being used for a cable box aka STB). I noticed that I had no issues when connecting my PS3, but the Xbox 360 would be silent.After reading the reviews on here, I put two and two together and figured out a fix. This worked for me and should work for all the 1-Star reviews. I opened the splitter up and noticed that the fiber optics were unsheathed on the inside. I used electrical tape to wrap both pairs of optical wires from each input. Closed her back up and connected it. It now works great.To recap: Do not use with a component that has a constant optical signal. How to tell? When the device is turned off, plug in an optical cable and check whether red light is still streaming. My DVR cable box does continue streaming and therefore cannot be used. The Xbox360 and PS3 can be used. Do the electrical tape repair and all should be well."
2,May not work with less sensitive equipment!,"The product did not work and then when I tried to remove an optical cable it came apart.Edit 6/14/2010I was trying to use this product to split the optical signal from my PS3 to a receiver and and a pair of headphones. The headphones get the signal perfectly and work with both of the split signal cables. The receiver works with neither, but works with a single optical cable from the sources. I tried shorter cables, but the signal was still not strong enough for my receiver (it's a Samsung). I believe this product working in this context depends on the sensitivity of the equipment receiving it. It would work better if the signal strength was boosted by the splitter, but that's obviously asking quite a lot at this price."
1,Spend the Extra $,"Well i received this and i am not joking when i say the casing fell apart as i was plugging it in for the first time, i re glued it back together but it still wouldn't work.I purchased the $20 TOSlink Switcher made by another brand available on Amazon and so far its been great, so save yourself the hassle and go straight for the better one."
1,A peace of junk,It doesn't work. Do not buy it. I do not know if return it or throw it to the garbage to avoid the hassle.
1,defected part,"the part i received was defected, it is not worth my time or expense to return this item to you. i will not purchase anything from you again.dave"
1,This optical splitter does not work.,"I have a HD Directv receiver and a Blu-Ray DVD player, both of which have digital optical outputs. Unfortunatley my surround sound receiver has only one input for the digital optical line. So, I looked on-line and found this splitter which has 2 input lines and 1 output line. This item claimed to automatically switch from one component to the other all by it self. Set-up was very easy, but unfortunaley it does not work, even when I turn off one of the components. No matter what I tried I could not get it to work. So I am back to manually plugging in the system I want to listen to, at least until I find a splitter that works, or upgrade to a surround sound processor that has 2 inputs."
1,"Might be a good product, didn't work for me","My receiver only has one optical input and wanted to connect two devices to it. I attempted to connect a HD DVD player and a regular Sony upconvert player. Neither would produce any sound through the splitter. It seems to have worked fine for some people, but not for me. Be prepared if this does not work for you."
1,Didn't work,"Seems to cause signal loss or distortion because the minute I put this thing between my optical link I cannot get my audio receiver to playback anything. Tried every which configuration including leaving the second port open and switching it backwards; I can see red light shining through but no signal detected on my audio reciever. Tried using devices: Xbox 360 w/ Monster connectors, a 42"" Hitachi HDTV, and a Panasonc Blu-ray player. My optical audio receiver is a Logitech Z-5500."
4,Glad it works,"Heres my quick review,I was aprehensive seeing some negative reviews but I hooked it up and it works just as they said it would.Of coarse whatever its being shared with needs to be off so drill that into the heads of the little ones(kids).You will also need an optical cable because it just doesnt plug into the back of the receiver, But the same page that had the splitter for sale had the optical cable for 1 penny! yes 1 penny how can you go wrong!I am into day number 2 of using the setup with my ps3 everthing A-OKGood Luck!"
1,Poorest quality,"I bought this for use as a 2 input into 1 output switch. It never worked. I opened it to see if there was some trivial problem. The construction is this: ""Take two pieces of optical cable, melt them together, and wrap in a plastic shell so no one can see what they're being charged for. Make sure not to check that it works."" Because of the poor construction and obvious lack of quality controls, I do not recommend this product."
1,Didn't work...for me,"Either I got a bad one or it's just not possible with the equipment i was using. I tested all my wires and everything works fine seperately but this little guy wouldn't allow me to run my Xbox 360 and my Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD Player co-existently. The design seems simple enough, but i couldn't even get it to split the signal the way it was meant to work. So maybe I got a defective unit. But it's not worth it to return it and pay for shipping on an item that was about 3 bucks and then 4 more for shipping. So I'm back to using my manual optical splitter from Radio Shack. Ten bucks and no hassles of not working."
1,Very disappointed. Mine is broken,"I tried to use it to connect both my HDTV and DVD player to the amplifier. The 2 for 1 configuration did not work. So I changed the direction of light, and used it as a splitter as it meant to be, but it still did not work. I think mime is broken somehow. When I connect the cables directly without the splitter, everything works. So all cables are fine. They are 6 ft long. Either the splitter is broken or the total length of 12 ft might be the issue. Not sure how to diagnose further."
1,Waste of money.,"Didn't work for me. Didn't performate as I expected. I couldn't even make a single connection work properly. I'm staying overseas, would be expensive and/or take a long time to have a replacement. And it won't work the opposite way neither (I couldn't connect two devices into the same input, even using them one at a time)."
3,Check Your Equipment!,"If either of the units you want to connect to this emits a red glow from the optical port even when the unit isn't in use, this WILL NOT work properly as a switch. You will have to find an alternative solution to connecting two outputs to one input. Otherwise this should work fine."
2,You get what you pay for,"I've experimented with different cables but only some actually ""fit"" into the plugs on the unit. I thought the Toslink was a standard size but apparently not. Some cables fit snug and ""snap"" into place. Others act like they will go in but they simply pop or fall out. When I was holding a cable in place on the splitter, everything worked. But I couldn't get it to work with the cables simply plugged in. I paid more for the shipping than I did for the splitter. Your mileage may vary."
1,Did not work for me...,"Tried to use this product to hook both my PS3 and DVR Box into my receiver's only optical input. Only the PS3 would work but it had alot of interference and cut in and out. I bought the Radioshack amplifier thinking I could put it on the ""out"" end of the splitter and clean things up. No dice. All I got was a loud clicking noise. Hooked up the amplifier to the DVR Box optical input and that made the cable signal usable but the PS3 was still unacceptable. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,terrible,"I am very disappointed. I really needed this and it does not work. I was going to use it for my tv and PlayStation, the tv sound worked but when I tried to switch it to the PlayStation it did not work. it was cheap so it was worth a shot..."
1,did not work,did not work didn't work tried different cables it did not workit is not costly though . but it doesn't work
1,Finally arrived and does not work.,"This finally arrived but does not work at all, if I took the two cables and touched them to each other I got sound but when i plugged into the splitter nothing. piece of junk"
2,Not Great As A Switch,"Like some of the other reviewers here I tried to use this as a switch between two devices, rather than as a splitter. In my case the signal from my Playstation 3 mostly worked, but was intermittently interrupted. As a test, I disconnected the second device... but the problem persisted. Once I flipped it around and treated it like a splitter though, the problem went away. Very strange. I was trying to avoid getting getting a proper switch that forced me to select between inputs, but it looks like that's the way I'll have to go after all."
2,No so good...,"I bought this product to use backwards like many other reviews have said. Well it doesn't work so well. First thing if you are going to us it backwards make sure you can turn off one of your optical devices because it will not work if both devices are on and connected to this. Second I switch out optical plugs on it pretty often and now after about a year sound will drop out intermittently until I move the wires connected to it, then the sound will come back. I am assuming the ports are getting lose over time because its plastic. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. I am going to buy a switch with an actual switch button on it. Overall, yes this is a pretty cheap product but not worth the headache. You pay for what you get."
2,Doesn't last...,Bought one of these and it didn't work. I had to send it back and order another. The second one I received work for approximately 6 months and then quit...
1,Didn't work for what I wanted to use it for.,"I'm not an expert on these splitters but it only cost $5 so I decided to just try it out.I play games and watch Netflix on my Xbox 360. When I watch Netflix I have my system hookup to my receiver. When I play games I hook up my Turtle Beach head set. I thought with this device I could have them hooked up at the same time. However this didn't work at all. Absolutely no sound came from surround sound system and the sound from my headset was distorted. Even when I cut off the connection to one of the devices, the other still didn't work properly (i.e. cut off the connection to the receiver but the head set still sound distorted, or cut of the connection to the head set and still no sound came from the receiver).For whatever you want to use this for, make sure you thoroughly research into and make sure that it is going to work before purchasing."
1,meh..,"The shipping cost more than the item when I bought it. But all I got was static, I was trying to use it to put my 360 and PS3 on the same optical input to my receiver. I think I read something about, interference from powered off console, even if its off there is atill light being emitted and it screws up the the other device. maybe if they added something to isolate an input, either a slide switch or electronically somehow."
1,Didn't work,"Tried using this to hook my PC and my 360 up to my receiver since I only have one optical input, since the computer always sends a signal it didn't work for me whether the 360 was on or not."
1,Didn't Work at all,"I have a receiver with one optical input and purchased this in order to use my Satellite receiver and my Xbox 360 optical audio. Didn't work. I can see some red light coming through, but apparently not enough for my receiver."
1,did not work,"will not play both my PS3 and Satelite TV, have to unplug one to make it work. dont waste your money."
2,Be careful - may not work for you,"The basic premise behind the splitter is sound. But remember that it is splitting the light signal, so each half only get 50% of the original ""intensity"" of the light. Some devices are sensitive enough to work with the diminished light, some are not. For example, my Denon receiver worked just great. My Tritton AX360 XBOX headphones DO NOT WORK AT ALL with the splitter. It's hit or miss."
1,Significant signal loss,"The signal loss through the splitter was so significant that my receiver did not recognize any signal coming through. When I connected it to the source (my HDTV) I could noticably see the light coming through was dimmer than what was coming out of the original cable. Unfortunately, it's not worth the cost to return the item. Since my receiver only has 2 optical inputs and 2 coax inputs (and the optical inputs are full - the original reason I tried the splitter) I will be buying an optical to coax converter as recommended on AVS Forums."
1,Does not work other way,"This product spitlits the signal ONLY, the other way it does not work.You can not combine 2 different signal into 1 input, even when you have only 1 signal goint through the product."
1,does not work for audio - may need signal booster,"I received two of these from a different company, first one had a broken piece in side of it (rattled) and did not work. Second splitter does not work either. Are these even made for audio? I've tried on half a dozen difference output sources including dvd players, multiple computers etc... i can see a light coming out of both ends but no sound coming out of splitter when connected. Cables and cords etc all are high quality and work great without splitter. No idea whats going on with this thing. After doing some research a signal booster before or after the split may solve this problem. I'm going to try that before i completely give up on this."
1,2 devices to one input does not work,I bought two hoping to connect four devices to two inputs and I couldn't get either adapter to work with any two devices. These are cheap devices and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
1,cheap,Was looking for an item to split optical between two devices. The splitter did not support the split. Not a good product waisted alot of time trying to make it work. Take my word. Buy a better product if you want something stable.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This product from BargainCell does not work for me. I have a Logitech Z-5500 Speaker System with one optical input. I tried to use this to attach two sources to one input. This product didn't even send enough signal for one connection to register.I would send the product back, but I will spend more in shipping then I will get back. At least I'm only out 8 bucks total...STEER CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT!"
1,The reviews say it all.,I read the bad reviews and ordered it anyway.Of course it didnt work.One side of the splitter worked but the other didnt. The side that did work I had to jiggle the cable until it worked.I checked all cables individually.They all worked.The slpitter did not work as advertised.
5,Absolutely great!!,"I was very glad I read these reviews before I bought the splitter. I assumed that you wouldn't be able to have both devices that are going into the splitter on at the same time but the reviews confirmed it and the suggestion to make sure the devices aren't transmiting audio signals when turned off was very helpful.My receiver has 2 optical audio inputs but I have an Xbox, blu-ray DVD and cable box that have digital output. I originally hooked up the DVD and Xbox to the optical inputs but the cable audio suffered terribly. I had to turn up the audio so high on the receiver when I was watching cable that the sound was distorted.I purchased this splitter and hooked my Xbox and Cable box to the splitter because they are never on at the same time. It worked perfectly. All the sound is great. I would highly recommend this device."
2,Very low quality,"This works like it should, but it is of very very low quality. When I insert the cables, they don't go ""click"" and they just fall out if any pressure is put on them. A little disappointing, but some duct tape fixed the problem. It just should have been fixed before."
1,Disappointed with product,"We were very disappointed with the splitter. No matter what we did it refused to pass through the sound despite the fact that we could see the ""weak"" bundle of light coming through the splitter. We even tried ""one in-one out"" and it still did not work. However, Media Markt refunded the purchase price immediately, no questions asked. Sorry to say you should avoid this product."
2,doesnt split,I needed it so I could split my computer and TV off of my stereo. It won't work unless you unplug one so its pointless to have.
1,Did not work!,Product did not work for me. I used multiple cables with still no luck. very disappointed.I tried getting it to work in both directions as well just in case.
1,Does not work,"Like others on here, I was not able to get this to work. Tried multiple cables, but no sound through this splitter. Tried 2 different splitters with no results."
1,Just doesn't work,"Don't waste your money, this does not work. I didn't take it apart so not sure it's anything more than a shell."
1,Never worked,"This item did not function from the time I opened the package. Plugged in my optical cable and found that light isn't even getting from one side to the other. No light, no signal. Save yourself the trouble and give your money to a street bum."
2,Junk,I have had some time with this now and it is junk. I don't know why. It is a simple device but the signal would just not work occasionally and that is unacceptable. I don't want to have to keep going to the back of the cabinet and wiggle wires. I would just be listening to audio and then it would stop working. I wanted to use this for piping a PS3 and 360 fiber to my 5.1 headset. It seemed more convenient than the fiber switches. Guess what I am buying to replace this.
1,Garbage,"Does not work. I have tried every way possible to make this thing work with no luck. Glad it was cheap, you get what you pay for I guess."
1,"Weak signal, intermittent sound",I spent some time troubleshooting since I also purchased the optical cable. I wanted to make sure that it was in fact the splitter that was defective. You can easily tell the dim light coming out of any end. A good signal will work without even locking the cable end to its counterpart attachment.Bad product.
2,works okay,"I bought one for a project I needed. It worked for what I needed it for, but the connection openings are not very tight. I had to make sure the cable was plugged into it and then made sure not to touch it."
2,Not quality splitters,Both splitters that I got made audio mute continuously. When I purchased new ones from Parts Express they worked perfectly...I guess if u want what you pay for order digital optical splitter from Parts Express in the first place.
1,Doesn't work,"It doesn't work. The cables appear to be fine, but I get no sound when going through this device. Don't waste your money."
1,"Garbage, don't buy","I bought two and both arrived broken. I returned them and the replacements arrived quickly. But they too arrived broken. These are simple items. It is just two optical cables combined into one. But the materials are so inferior that they just break. I just don't know how you can make these so unreliably, but these folks are going out of their way. I don't know how you can make these things to just break when you hook them up. These are inexpensive, but just don't waist your money."
1,Do not waste you money. Would not give it a star if i could,"Tried to go cheap, but you get what you pay for. I have 2 optical inputs on my hometheater system, but needed 3 for my Xbox, Cable box and just purchased PS3. Hooked it up to my Xbox and PS3 and sound would not come out of either machine. You would think it would work, since no signal comes from either machine when off. I knew it was not the cables, since I have good ones. I guess I will go spend money on a good swtich now. The only this this thing is good for is a doorstop."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this piece to connect outputs from two devices(Bluray player, HD media player) into my receiver which has only one optical input. It worked the first time, then stopped completely after I tried switching the devices. Tried powering down one device at a time, then powering down both, but still no luck. The only way to make it work was to unplug the connections and connect again! And the audio quality loss was significant even while it worked.Going for a better switch :-("
1,Complete Waste Of Money - Will Not Work,"This does not work for what most people's intentions are. Regardless of what you've read, it does not work as a splitter for two devices in, one device out. I've tried every possible configuration and can only get it to work as nothing more then an extender for a single cable. It doesn't matter if one of your two devices is off, as long as there are two cables present, it will not send the signal. Fortunately it was pretty cheap, but still, cost plus shipping didn't make up for the frustration spent trying to get this to work ""As Advertised"""
1,Optical Splitters,"My bad experience is that optical sound splitters do not work. The technology apparently is not available that will split the sound on an optical cable. Optical cables appear to only work if they are a dedicated line direct from the source to the receiver. Any interruption, such as a splitter or a switch, somehow stops the flow of the sound and it does not get to the receiver. I have tried several vendors and both failed. These were products made in China. The Amazon customer ratings and reviews are very misleading. Beware to the customer. I have also contacted local electonics vendors and am getting the same response verbally. There is a lot of smoke out about these products and believe me, I have seen the fire. They just do not work. That is my opinion and review of recent items purchased."
1,umm peice of crap.,"well not much to say. i got the product a couple of days late. not really sure why, oh well no big deal. first attempt to use it was at a local tournament in a winners semifinal match. the splitter didnt work, i couldnt use my ear force dss2.. wack."
5,Awesome!,"Received in the mail yesterday and must say this is absolutely the best product, especially for the price. They have another optical splitter with a switch that sell for around $20 that breaks far too easily. I am using this one as getting audio from my ps3 and 360 into my amplifier and it works perfectly!For ANYONE who says it does not work, you MUST make sure the other machine is turned OFF or else it will override the audio, that's how optical works, it can only take one signal at a time. This was well worth the price!!"
3,It all depends on your setup.,"I bought this product to have both my PS3 and Cable box connected to my home theater system. It worked fine when my PS3 was OFF and cable box was ON. There was good sound quality. However, when it was the other way around (PS3 ON/Cable box OFF), it did not work. The reason is that my cable box sends optical audio signal even when it's turned OFF and my speaker system cannot receive two audio signals at a time. The only way for it to work is that if I unplugged my cable box from the electricity outlet but that would defy the reason I bought this for.So, It all depends on your devices. Most cable boxes would give you that problem. I assume it would work fine with PS3 and XBox.The good part is that it's not expensive and it's worth taking the risk but there's no harm in doing your homework before you purchase this piece. Good luck."
2,Doesn't work well,"I bought this to try to split the digital optical output from my Xbox 360 to both my audio receiver and my Tritton AX PRO headset. After splitting, the signal was only strong enough to get 2 channel sound from the receiver and scratchy mono audio from the headset. I'm skeptical that any splitter would have done the job, but this one sure didn't. I reverted back to using an old optical switch that doesn't reduce the signal strength at all."
1,Doesn't work (when it really should work),"I want to connect the digital optical audio both my computer and my XBox to the same input on my audio receiver. (Only one device would be in operation at any given time.)If I hold the optical cable from a device near the optical cable leading to the receiver, and aim the light, holding my hands steads, the audio works.However, plugging both cables into the device resulted in silence.So I returned the device, and got a replacement.The replacement works better, but still not good. It plays audio for about a minute, then cuts out for a few seconds, then comes back, then cuts out... all without jostling the device or any cables.My conclusion: The optics in this splitter are crap. Don't buy one."
1,Not a Combiner!,"If you're buying this to have 2 audio sources plugged into something like a receiver, this will NOT work! No matter how I arranged the cables one device would output sound and the other would not. I bought this so I wouldn't have to deal with a switch, but only one thing will work even if the device you're not using is turned off, you actually have to unplug it for the other device to work."
2,:(,"When I got the shampoo, it had leaked in the envelope and I lost 25% of the shampoo. I have used this product before and liked it, but I felt like the shampoo had been watered down. Overall I wasn't happy with the shampoo from this supplier"
2,had to change phone number,"I looked and looked while shopping, and found no indication that I would lose my old phone number. So, I bought throguh Amazon - a 2 year plan. The phone shipped with new number. I called customer survice but by then it would cost hundreds to do it differently.Amazon should make that clearer on the web site - beware."
2,Poor Shipment Quality,"You are better off looking in a real store for these bulbs, and not buy them online. I purchased two of these bulbs, as a power surge took out two of my Eclipse System 12 existing lights. The price was right, so I bought.Shipping was fast, but the quality was poor. The bulbs came in just one carrier envelope, with very little padding. You would think a little more care would go into the packaging of these. Just as you can imagine, one of the bulbs was completely smashed and, thus, unusable.The second bulb was installed, and immediately burnt out (sending a power surge throughout the rest of the circut). This I am not blaming on anyone, but it is apparent that the wiring in the hood was damamged, and not just the bulb itself. Please take note of that if you are in a similar situation."
5,Women this a book you must read.,"This book tells you aot of things we are doing for our men. Well we need to STOP!Read, read and read."
4,Good Advice,"I just recently started dating again, and I bought this book for some dating tips. I was impressed that several men were interviewed, and put the advice to work on my new boyfriend. I was glad that I read the book because I had a guideline to follow regarding dressing, communicating, and intimacy. The relationship worked for two months, and I was taken on an expensive Carribbean vacation and received several expensive gifts of jewelry. Upon returning from vacation, he stopped calling. I followed the advice in the book about letting him know how bad I was feeling, and asking him to let me know if the relationship had changed direction. I never received a response from him, which I thought was very disrespectful and I let him know it. There is still no response from him. The book has some good advice, but it won't work on everyone, as I found out."
2,Too much stereotyping,"While the book does make a number of good points, there is too much stereotyping. De Angelis's starting point for each of her arguments is the premise that ""Men are solution-oriented while women are process-oriented"". I personally have not met any woman who would fit De Angelis's theory of the sexes. The book is full of the same stereotypes and generalizations that have for centuries confined women to the home. If we were to take for granted that men hold their career above all else while for women relationships always come first, how could we ever argue that it would make sense to vote for a female president?"
3,Repetitive and common-sense,"The book could have been about 100 pages shorter, I found much of it to be repetitive of prior chapters. I also found much of it to be ""common-sense"" - like men don't like women who are dirty, smelly, or don't take care of themselves. Basically, I didn't find any ""secrets"" in the book that I didn't already know."
3,general infromation on sex and sensuality,"Barbara de Angelis draws from her counselling and consulting pratice.That is her strength.But, for the most part,the information is commnon knowledge for women in this liberated era.Parts of the book read like porn stuff to attract large readership to increase sales...could be with more discretion..anyway the book may help some jaded women...."
4,Helpful only if you want it to help.,"This book is helpful only if you want it to, just like anything else in life. I had a poor relationship that I got out of. I started to read the book after I got rid of that bad man. It helped me and I understood it. However I have a girlfriend I gave the book to and it helped her for that short time. My theory is that a woman chooses a Certain type for some psychological reasons of her own. If you have a difficult time understanding your man than thats you, not him. You chose him. Either get rid of him or learn about him. Yet in some relationships the man should be dumped. Beating, Laziness, Selfishness should not be tolerated. A relationship is consisted of two people striving for EACHOTHER TO BE HAPPY."
5,Quite informative,"I found this book to be very informative. It teaches you how to understand men and how to have a good relationship. It also tells you what they like and dislike, how to treat them. I would say it's like a mini-encyclopaedia of men!"
5,This book is very informative!,This is the second time I have purchased this book. The first time I let a friend borrow and never got it back! It really helps you to relate to the men in your life and gives you some insight as to what every woman in relationships with men will face or have already faced. Her interviews with men proved helpful. This book made for a great read!
4,CHICK FLICK,"Let's call it what it really is: a chick flick. This is the first movie where I can say Traci Lords was credible as an actress. While not her most entertaining role, she did play it better than I had expected, perhaps a bit over done at times. Maybe she was just playing herself, with a capital ""B."" Once you get past the plot, i.e. please let me have your seed and I wiil publish your novel, the movie becomes entertaining as Traci Lords and Paul Johansson pull off some good chemistry."
2,Go-Go-Gadget Trash Can!,"The game looks nice, but the first level is immedatley a disaster. The control is horrible. Pressing R lets you switch gadgets, but it's almost complete random whenever gadgets pop up, you just have to be lucky.Final Verdict?GO GO GADGET TRASH CAN"
2,Salt and Sage,"I was not impressed, especially for the price. Very salty and full of sage. I can get better seasonings at Walmart for under $3"
2,Choose a different history book,"my first problem with this book was the amount of art Wolpert discusses, yet the only pictures are maps that are hard to read. There are pictures of harappan seals, but not in this book. My second problem is his Hindu bias, Bramin are supressive people, but he glosses over supression campaigns in India by declairing them proof of Hinduisms openness to new ideas. There were others too, but oh well."
1,really out of date,"Except for chapter 26, the contents of this book would suggest that writing about the history of India stopped in the 1970s. There has been an enormous amount of scholarship in the last quarter century that should be incorporated into any serious history of South Asia. If the author is unwilling to do so, OUP should find another scholar able to update this very readable but now terribly antiquated volume."
5,Excellent Book,"This was an excellent book. I am an Indian, and went through schooling in India where we were shoved ""politically correct"" history through our throat. This book clears up so much. For instance even today Indian textbooks refer to the mughal invaders as great men (to pacify certain minority communities). Mr. Wolpert is not averse to write about them as they actually were; marauders and looters.Not only I feel better informed about India, but I have a better perspective about my own self, and psyche.A must read if you want to know the history of India in a few interesting pages. Although it is a history text, it reads like a novel."
5,Lots of fun!,"I caught Pasquale at my ""Zia's"" house. She is a long time fan'; I'm a new fan. Great guy, enjoyable to watch. Lots of fun; especially for those who grew up in Italian homes..."
2,OK,"I got size small and was somewhat excited to get them because the nylon fabric sounded really comfortable. These are comfortable, they stay dry and I expect will last awhile, but one of mine came with some loose threads that undid some of the fabric sewn together. It didn't create a hole but one of the seams has loose fabric now. Also, while I am skinny I've never had such loose fitting leg holes on a pair of underwear and even the elastic band is not as snug as I'm used to. I'll probably not get these again."
4,The Eastern Frontier,A very useful book for my research that had a good description from the seller. Fast delivery. Competitive pricing.
3,good,"the company was great in shipping the item in a timely manner, then was excellent at replacing the item when it arrived damaged. However, the fuel cups even the 2nd time around still arrived a little damaged. I believe it has nothing to do with this company, but rather the packaging around the actual fuel cups."
2,Break in the mail,"My new fondue set recommends the Swissmar 3-once tins of gel fuel, but when I ordered them from a very good company at Amazon, the tins opened up in the mail and spread all over the box. I contacted the company and they were very nice and resent the tins at no cost to me. Those opened up in the mail too. Between the two boxes I scraped up enough fuel for my party. I kept one of the tins and bought the 17 oz bottle instead. I will be ordering the 17-oz bottle from now on."
1,Too little burn time. Package was all bent up and leaking.,"The product arrived bent up, with fuel leaking from 2 of the tins. They were unusable and I was only able to use one of the tins. It has very little burn time."
2,Wouldn't stay lit. Period.,Wouldn't stay lit without a battle. Would had been better off with a candle under my fondue pot. Now you know.
3,Damaged product,"The product was just fine. The shipment was packed well, but unfortunately 3 of the cans were damaged. The seal was broken. It was a real gel mess, but I was able to salvage most of the product."
3,"OK, but strong perfume odor","I was really only looking for a detangler. I had been hoping the perfume wouldn't be so strong. Isn't terrible, but definitely strong."
2,Simplistic review of topics without much detail,"I purchased this book hoping to get some deeper understanding of risk (e.g., approaches for measuring risk, how to quantify risk.) This book was way too high level to achieve that goal. It is a quick read with lots of case examples that would be helpful if you're giving someone a high level overview of Risk Management. However, if you want to understand these topics at a slightly detailed level or deeper, you should probably look at the more text book style books on risk management."
5,A Highly Recommended Read,"If ever there was a book to capture the topic of the times, this is it. This salient, well-written book treats the topic of risk intelligently and pragmatically. Most refreshingly, it treats risk from the point of view of the business person, manager or executive forced to live with and manage risk on a day-to-day basis.KPMG's risk management advice is coupled with interesting, colorful and very enjoyable interviews with top executives at British Airways, Oracle, Microsoft, Sprint, shipping giant P&O and others. Even General Barry McCaffrey chimes in with his thoughts on business lessons from the battlefield.In all, an engaging read that I recommend for my peers but not my competitors."
1,Not very Useful,"The book delivers what it promises the so-called CEO perspective. Its just a chatty overview, useless for actual risk management at any level. Maybe they should use it as an introductory MBA book for those who have no exposure to finance at all."
5,South Park ROCKS!,"I have enjoyed each of the eleven seasons of South Park so far, and look forward to many more. I especially enjoyed the Fantastic Easter Special. Any of the South Park fans will enjoy this most recent season and episode."
5,I just can't believe it!,Does anyone remember Jesus and Santa singing Rio together? I told my friends that South Park was done after that because you just can't get better. Ever year since then I have been proved wrong. South Park has become quite possibly the best show on television. This season's Imagination Land was just awesome! Bringing back Man-Bear-Pig was great! I laughed numerous times throughout each episode during this season! Definitely recommended!
2,What a weird show,"South Park never ceases to amaze me at what they come up with. Don't get me wrong I find a lot of the shows funny. Where else can you find talking poo, a character that is killed every episode, kids that seem to run the town they live in, clueless parents and so much more? This particular episode however was not a favorite of mine, in fact I really didn't care for it."
4,South Park at it's finest,I just can't believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are still able to churn out new episodes any more. It constantly seems that they've done it all and there's nowhere left to go. Then they put out a new episode that blows my mind away all over again. It's my opinion that whatever record The Simpsons make for being on the air the longest will be broken by South Park. Go buy this season immediately.
4,South Park Season 11,"These kids just keep getting funnier and funnier, and i love that this season is uncensored."
5,Another season that will make you laugh,Well they have done it again. South Park Season 11 is sure to have you in stitches as you spend time with your favourite characters in the little town of South Park. So many great episodes have been put into this 3 dvd colletion. Well worth the money.
4,"""guitardedboy"" is right... bleeps work better.","Bleeps make this show MUCH funnier. This was also the case with THE OSBOURNES, the bleeped version was much funnier than the uncensored version. But with that show they offered a choice. Watching SOUTH PARK without the bleeps takes away the comedy ""edge"" it has. I looooove SOUTH PARK, and I looooove season 11, but they should have offered us an alternative version audio track. Isn't that what DVDs are all about?"
3,South park eleventh season,My son was happy with the DVD. I was unhappy because I tried to download the 30.00 instant savings with the sign up of the Amazon.com credit card I could not and still do not have nor heard from the credit card dept.???
5,South Park Rocks,"I wish I could obtain ALL the South Park DVD's...hate to pick and choose, but at almost 25 bucks a piece....but I digress...what did I think of the 11th edition? Simply Marvelous! South Park is what keeps me sane and gives me a reason to live!"
1,Not Memory Foam!!!!,"This is not a memory foam mattress. It is a spring coil mattress with a thick plastic cover. It feels like you are on an airbed or pool float. I am not one to bother with returning items but this was such a disappointment I was planning on going through the trouble for once. However, the return fee was almost as much as the mattress. So It is currently being used as a box springs for my daughters thinner crib mattress with a memory foam mattress topper. If you want memory foam this is not the mattress for you. I almost considered making it a dog bed but it was not comfy enough for even my dogs to sleep on."
2,The book was soooo much better,"I had read the book and it was very good so I thought I would see the movie. The book was so much better (it usually is) then the movie. I did expect the book to be better and the movie to have some changes but they seemed to change the story way too much. Even the setting of the movie was all in daylight and in that part of Alaska, that time of year you get about 4 hours of daylight. I was disappointed with the movie. Some of the events and characters that were in the book, and made the story more suspenseful were removed. I am shocked that Nora Roberts allowed that much alteration to the story. If you read the book, wait for the movie on lifetime. The acting was not as good as I expected."
2,Leanne Rhimes Should Stick to Singing.,"Ok plot, not the best...acting is sub-par...rhimes really should stick to singing, the horrible acting really ruined the movie."
1,bad movie,"I am commenting on the movie itself- not a seller. The actually movie is awful! Actors are unbelievable, plot is predictable and some of the camera shots look like it was done by an intern. I like Leann Rimes as a singer, but definitely not as an actor. I've never read any Nora Roberts books, but I wouldn't be inclined to do so by watching this movie."
1,save your money,"One of my favorite Nora Roberts books and I bought movie thinking it would be true to the book just a little. It didn't even have enough of the Alaskan scenery to make up for the horrible way plot and characters were totally screwed, I wouldn't even rate it one star."
3,"I'm a Leann Rimes fan, so I had to see Northern Lights!","My reason for purchasing this movie on DVD was because I could never catch it on demand or TV, so I HAD to purchase it. I wanted to see if I could figure out if there was real chemistry between the two main actors- I was looking for a great love story. Unfortunately, this was not anything special, in my opinion. I did appreciate the supporting actors, though. Leann is a great actress and Eddie can hold his own, but this movie just didn't have the romance I was looking for. It may have been due to something lacking in the writing and production, but like I said, ""It's nothing special""."
3,"Movie first, book second","Pretty good movie. If you read the book first then you will be dissapointed with the movie. If you're a pilot , you are really going to be dissapointed with the movie. All in all it is a pretty good movie."
5,awesome,This was an awesome movie it was a great addition to my nora roberts collection the cast and story lines are put together just right. just an awesome choice.
3,A great classic,"I was no fan at all of space side view shooter games, but this one caught my interest. You start the game by selecting all of your weapons, then you are sent out on your mission to fly through scores of enemy space fleets, destroying them to collect powerups and at the end of each level destroy bad bosses. The bad part about the game is that when you die you lose all of your powerups, and start from scratch making it very difficult to get more powerups later in the game because of the difficulty. Another huge downfall is that the sixth level is virtually impossible without having super sharp reflexes. Its a classic that might not be for everyone."
4,"Thoughtful, not extreme","Many people have painted Duesburg as a crank, but this book demonstrates otherwise. He makes two points: first, how quirks of history and politics have made the medical establishment accept that HIV causes AIDS in spite of flimsy evidence, and second, his alternative hypothesis providing a different explanation of the cause of AIDS. As someone who doesn't buy his drug-AIDS theory, I still highly recommend this book as a brilliant critique of AIDS research."
4,good stuff,"Good products, works well on athletic clothing (at least I've noticed a considerable improvement in terms of smell over woolite)"
5,"Yes, it does really work",My husband's workout clothes would smell so bad I would make him keep them separate from the rest of the laundry. Sometimes I had to launder them twice to remove the smell. Now they come out of the laundry with a fresh clean smell (even older clothes) and I found it also works for cat smells as well! Now if I could just get him to do the laundry.
2,LEAKY BOTTLES!,"I'll start off by saying that I like this product. I had to have this re-shipped 3 times because the bottles leaked till almost empty!!! All three times, they leaked and they leaded on a shirt that I had them shipped with.So, get this stuff. It's a good product, but don't order it from here."
4,The stink smells good!,"Well I have been playing hockey for over 20 years and I thought that the foul odor of roadkill was just part of the package. I washed my gear as soon as I received this detergent and let me tell you, it actually smells good. It took about 4 or 5 washes to really take the odor away and yes, there is still a hint of stink on my gear, but you really have to look for it. I am very impressed with this product and you can be sure I will continue to use it."
4,"Cleans Well, poor shipping","This product works well, however, bleach is still needed when cleaning whites. Would probably work better with soft water. Amazon's shipping needs some improvents. A whole bottle of WIN was lost in the original shipping when the box was tossed or mashed. Box was received repackaged from second handler (DHL)without protective packing or covering. This is the second item I have ordered from Amazon this year that was received damaged or otherwise opened. I would encourage Amazon to look over their training and package handling procedures with employees and to clarify with shipping vendors that they value customer property and receipt without loss to the consumer."
4,"Detergent works, bottle doesn't","The detergent did a good job cleaning the nasty odors that my workout clothing acquired despite regular washings in Tide. As noted by other reviewers, the bottles leak; even when tightened, the caps do not properly seal the bottles."
5,Happy Customer,This detergent is great. Cleans and works as advertised. No more stinky guy when I start ride the bicycle or work out.
5,"Great product, highly recommend",This stuff works wonders on technical apparel. After running multiple marathons this will take the stench out of your clothes and be gentle on them at the same time.
5,The best detergent for taking out B.O. smell from clothing.,"This is truly the greatest laundry detergent I have found that completely takes out any B.O. smell out of my exercise clothes!! I had such a hard time getting the smell out, is seemed to come back if I put them in the dryer, not any more. I was afraid to try this product, now I don't want to be without it!!"
2,didnt remove odors as effectively as promised,"I am a varsity athlete for a college rowing team. I work out on average 20 hours a week and thus have a large amount of dirty atheletic apparell to deal with on a weekly basis.I expected that WIN would solve my laundry problems. However when i tested it out on what i would call a normal to smaller sized load of athletic laundry, it didnt clean the clothes as thoroughly as my regular TIDE detergent. I used the reccomended half capful for this load so thereafter i figured that i needed to use at least a full cap to one and a half capfulls in order to adequately clean my laundry.After increasing the amount of detergent that i used it did get my clothes clean but still not any better than regular detergent.All in all i spent more than i think i should on a bottle of detergent that lasted a week and i would not buy this product again. I seriously doubt that it is capable of cleaning the clothing of Olympic athletes if it cant even clean my own."
3,Doesn't live up to the performance,"It could be the high efficiency front loader....but I could not get the type of performance that others had talked about. I had ordered this as well as the 7th genberation, and I was surprised the 7th generation performed much better for me."
2,Also Leaked!,I ordered this stuff and the bottles were half full! They had leaked out during shipment. I saw the other posting as well so I just gave up and bought them local.
5,This product works very well. Amazon needs to learn how to ship it properly though!,"I have tried a lot of different detergents and I can honestly say that this is the only one I found that truly eliminates the odors on all my workout clothes. It leaves the clothes clean and fresh smelling. Great price from Amazon too, but beware Amazon is not good at packing this item. I had two different orders of this detergent arrive and both had loose caps, product laying down and leaking inside the box... a big mess and Amazon not too helpful with customer service. But, you cannot beat this price so take the good with the bad."
3,Win Detergent,"Works okay after one wash but there's still some odor. After 2 washes there's little or no odor. Two bottles arrived leaking, it looks like I'm not the first or probably the last with that complaint."
5,WIN Detergent,"This product works great for sweaty, smelly, athletic clothes. The scent is very refreshing. We had to order it online though because it is hard to find locally."
4,"Excellent product, but poor packaging","This product is excellent for cleaning your dirty, stinky workout clothes. I highly recommened it, however the packaging wasn't the greatest. One of the bottles leaked and got all over the package and ripped it a little."
2,ONLY if you are into tube type televisions,Great book but somewhat dated in subject matter.160 pages total and 146 of them are on tube television troubleshooting.Pages 147 through 160 actually contain good info on different probes and test leads.
2,Mercy,"Having read most of Jodi Picoult's books and enjoyed the majority of them, I would rate ""Mercy"" as one of her weaker ones. The majority of the characters came across as being selfish egotists and the storyline was very predictable, don't wait for a twist at the end as it is not there. Very disappointed."
4,Mercy by Jodi Picoult,"An inspiring and captivating novel on love, trust and betrayal. lt shows how lust and wanting that which is forbidden can destroy the solid and stable relationship built. Can love drive one to kill ones beloved?A novel that cant be put down. Suspence and nail-biting."
2,Didn't keep my attention,"I have read many of Picoult's books, but this one was easy to put down and hard to pick back up. I liked the story line, but got tired of the sex and really only enjoyed the first chapter when the wife throws her adulteress husband out."
2,Mercy,I felt book was a little boreing i did not enjoy it maybe it is just me i just did not enjoy guys
4,Book Club Selection,"A good read, though somewhat sad. I believe this authoris well-known and I can't complain. Held my interest. Thebook arrived quickly & in good shape. No complaints!"
3,Fair at best,"Wanted to read this book because as a nurse I have often felt frustrated by the suffering of some of my patients. My husband and I have often discussed our wishes such as living wills etc. Could totally relate to Jaimie the main character but not really sure about how Allies affair related. Understand the premise of the book ""how one loves more than the other"" but did not feel that this necessarily had to be so in depth w/this other character."
4,intriguing and captivating,A captivating story line that you don't want to put down. A thoroughly entertaining book full of meticulous detail and unexpected twists which hold the reader's attention.
4,Mercy,"Mercy did begin just a little slowly,but quickly grabbed my attention. Picoult,as is typical for her work,presented entertainment,but much more interesting to me the struggle of bioethics."
3,not as engrossing as other her books,"started to read but stopped it--too slow for me after reading The Pact. After a few weeks, I'll probly try again"
1,If this had been the first Picoult I had read it also wouldve been the LAST!,"I fell in love with Jodi Picoults storytelling when I read ""My Sisters Keeper"" Loaned it to everyone I know and then quickly gobbled up all the ones I had missed prior to that title, then eagerly awaited her next tale. When I read ""Mercy"" I felt the same way that most of these other reviewers felt. I hated all of the characters. Didn't find a single one of them to have any redeeming qualities. I love the fact that all of her stories deal with REAL issues, things that we hear on the news or see in our own lives. To be very clear it was NOT the topic that bothered me, I am not anti euthenasia, but I am very anti ""Mercy"" This is the only title that I would say totally and completely disappointed me. Only good part about it was I borrowed it from the library and didnt waste my money on it."
4,Mercy,"I have read a few of Jodi Picoult books and have never been disappointed. This particular book was definitely a great book. Really gives you ""food for thought"". Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend it."
3,Mercy,"It was a fairly good book. My main problem with it was Maggie, when someone has cancer to the point they want to die they don't act like she did. They usually stay in bed, weak and in pain. Maggie was able to go to the Dr on her own, and even go out to dinner and dancing with Jamie, thats not someone who is ready to die. Her action were not of a very sick woman so on that count I would say Jamie had no right to kill her, wasn't mercy killing it was murder."
3,Superficial exploration of euthanasia,"Picoult has dealt skillfully with controversial medical subjects in many of her books. I was looking forward to an equally skillfully exploration and discussion of the subject of euthanasia, assisted suicide or mercy killing. Instead it read like a romance novel, lacking the insightful development of the difficult decisions families and patients face in end-of-life care. The focus of the story seemed to be more about extra-marital affairs and betrayal and guilt."
2,flat,i love jodi picoults books ive read most of them however i really really didnt liek this book. Boring boring boring. The story never picks up. Flat...and 200 pages could get cut out and still tell the same story.read other books by her not this one
2,Premise is Good....Book Is NOT,I thought this would be a really good book. Wrong. The characters are boring. The story bounces all over the place losing the readers interest. It goes no where fast.Picoult dropped the ball on this book. It was so bad I couldn't get more than half way through it.
2,Have Mercy,"Just let me say that is very very rare that I put down a book but this one and I quote Dorothy Parker ""Should be thrown with great force"" Ugh I got halfway through this book hoping against hope that it would grab hold and I would start to like at least one of the characters but none of them from start to finish have any redeeming qualities... That was not the only problem... Why was there so much detail on mundane things that were completely unnecessary to the story... Don't bother!!! This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read..."
1,Holy crap,You must be sliding down the hill to insanity charging that much for a download book making sure that much of the population cannot afford to read it. Sure hope that works for you. GREADY whoever priced this book must be on crack.
1,Did not hold my attention,"Like many others, I have enjoyed many of her other books. I'm a listener not a reader and found myself going back listening to sections over and over because the book just didn't hold my attention. The storyline of mercy killing was indeed overshadowed by Cam's affair and Allie too easily forgave.I would not recommend."
1,Disappointing,I should have trusted the other reviews. I didn't think Jodi Picoult could write a bad book but this is dross. The characters are thin and I simply don't care what happens next. Ive tried to persevere but life is too short.
5,Mercy,"Another Jodi Picoult story with a controversial subject, in this case, euthanasia. The book examines all aspects of the mercy killing of a wife with end stage metastatic cancer by her husband who can't stand to see her suffer anymore. When she asks him to end her life he does in the most gentle way he can think of because he loves her so much. From begining to end it was a page turner."
2,Where was the surprise?,"I have read Plain Truth, My Sister's Keeper and am in the process of reading Keeping Faith. I loved the ending of the first two I finished and thought I would be ready for the surprise at the end of this one but it never happened. Definitely not impressed. Interesting story line until the end."
1,Disturbing,"If you don't like books about husbands cheating on their wives and that's okay, don't read it. I don't plan on picking up another Jodi Picoult book for a long long time. I was so distracted by the cheating that I couldn't focus on the legal situation that the story was SUPPOSED to be about."
3,"Good, but not my favorite Picoult novel","A self-described Picoult fanatic, Mercy was definitely not my favorite. The premise of mercy killing or ""euthanasia"", while topical, took a little digging to get to. There was SO MUCH else going on between the cover that it took a while to get to the ""meat"" of the story. While I enjoyed reading about one husband's foray into adultery, I am not certain how pertinent it was to the story Picoult was trying to tell. Again, too much going on.BUT - I adore Picoult's style and am always satisfied at the end of the read (except maybe for Keeping Faith, but that's a whole 'nother tale!)"
3,Mercy,A bit slow in the beginning but a good middle and the ending could have been better overall I enjoyed the book.
3,I'll try again 3?,"Does anyone else have a hard time finishing Picoult? The momentum dips half way through. I know she has a big following but The Pact I could not finish, at least now. I am reading Songs of Humpback Whales which is good. I hope Mercy is best."
2,Not her best,"I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books. I would have to say that I do not consider this one of her best. The beginning caught me but it soon slowed down. The book was well written; it just moved slowly and was fairly predictable. I found myself just wanting to finish it so I could move on to a new book. I do recommend Jodi Picoult, but just not this book."
3,Deccent Read,My book club was no blown away by this book. It took a little longer to get into than most of Jodi Picoult's books. Overall all it was a decent read and I am glad that I read it.
3,Not Picoult's best,"This was the sixth book by Jodi Picoult I have read and definitely my least favorite. I found the characters so frustrating and despicable I was relieved when I had finished reading it. Another big problem I had was the lousy editing. I lost count of the number of misspelled words, a huge pet peeve of mine. I've never encountered this problem in her other books."
3,Great Story - Not As Expected,"My first Joid Picoult book and not my last. I enjoyed the perspective on love, euthanasia, and guilt. A reader who is used to a twist was expecting a bit more at the end but all in all very good."
2,Not her finest...,"Frankly, I'm surprised that I made it all the way through this book--all of the characters are so unlikeable! I'm not really sure why any reader should care about what happens to any of them. As one other reviewer commented, the only character that was kind of likeable was the cat--unfortunately, even the cat annoyed me as he was schlepped around everywhere in a backpack. He's a cat. He can be left alone for a day.Predictable plot outcome, and the melodrama was high."
3,Good but Not Picoult's Best - 3.5/5 Stars,"Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors and Mercy was the only book of hers that I had not read, so it went to the top of my TBR list for 2009.The primary characters in this book are Carmeron McDonald, a police chief in a small town in MA; his wife Allie who runs a flower shop. Jamie McDonald (Cam's cousin) who killed his terminally ill wife as an act of ""Mercy"", and then there is Mia, who is new in town, and soon begins helping out in the flower shop with Allie.There are two stories with a central theme going on in Mercy, both involve the power of love. One story involves a Mercy killing, followed by a heated murder trial. The other story had to do with betrayals in a marriage.This story had a lot of potential, but I felt a little disappointed once I finished the book. For me, this story did not compare to come of her other books, my favorites being: My Sister's Keeper, The Pact, and Nineteen Minutes."
3,On the fence a little bit still....,"It was a good read because she's a great writer and Picoult makes you see the town, the home, the characters so accuately. She even makes you feel the hurt, the betrayal that the characters do. I wish she would have finished it differently, I wish that the side drama apart from the main issue at hand with the dear man who killed his wife out of mercy...I wish the other punishment would have fit the crime! That bothered me but it was still showed great talent in her writing. I just came away wanting more."
2,Picoult,"I have many (most ) of Jodi Picoult books. I loved the first 2-3 I read. 19 Minutes, My Sister's Keeper and a few others. Mercy was not one of my favorites, nor was Keeping Faith. maybe I am getting tired of her books, but they use to grab me on page one. Both of these books seemed to drag. They also were more predictable than others in her series. It seems like she is researching topics of interest to her and spinning them into books. The discussion of stamata was interesting, but it seemed to occupy too much of the story. Mercy also seemed to drag in spots. I am accustomed to reading her books quickly, hardly waiting to turn the page."
3,"I really like Picoult, BUT.........","This one wasn't her best. OK, maybe was a good one, for sure, but I've read several and ""Plain Truth"" was far better, among others. I did like it. I'm not saying I didn't.....but Cam's affair really just threw me for a loop, and I LOVED how his wife dealt with it! LOVED IT! So much I wish my hubbie would cheat on me so I could do that!!! FYI, if this is your first Picoult book, try another one too, because several others are better."
5,Excellent Story!,This is one of the best authors I have read in a couple of years. I am looking forward to his next book.
3,Mercy,"Book cover was bend and torn at the bottomStory line was predicable from the beginning, not one of her best."
1,Disappointed,"This book was a total disappointment. There were two story lines that could have easily been separate books but together they did not work. The first being a story about Mercy Killing which is a topic that we too may one day struggle with. The other story line was about a weak man who attempts to save his marriage, when his affair is over and he just wants consistency back in his life.My first introduction to Jodi Picoult was when I read her book ""Nineteen Minutes"" I recommended that book to all of my friends and family. She is a gifted writer but Mercy is not one of them."
3,Definitely Not a Show-Stopper,"Jamie MacDonald drives into the center of Wheelock, MA, and announces that he has killed his wife Maggie, whose body is in the car. Cameron MacDonald is the sheriff of Wheelock, and Jamie's cousin. Nevertheless, Cam arrests Jamie for murder one. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, Cam hires Jamie a lawyer when he finds out that Maggie was dying of cancer and that her murder was a mercy-killing.At the same time, Cam becomes involved with a young woman who works in his wife's flower shop and begins an affair with her that threatens to shatter his reputation as sheriff, clansman, and husband.I did not find this to be one of Picoult's better works. I was very frustrated by all of the Scottish clan details. It was extranious and unnecessary. I couldn't really connect to these characters, either. Cam just came off as a selfish jackass, and Jamie was an almost non-entity. I know Picoult is capable of much better than this, so I was very disappointed."
1,Irritating,"This is the fifth Jodi Picoult's novel I've read and probably will be the last one. I almost put it down because it simply got to my nerves. That Cameron Mc Donald was such a selfish, arrogant and weak man and Allie, his wife, such a pushover, that I just could not stand neither one of them. What irritated me most was the fact that after finding out that he was betraying her, Allie punishes Cam, but then forgives him (a deduction based on the notes Cam writes to Mia, which are on the left page at the beginning of each chapter). A good sequel would be one with Allie, leaving this guy for good, leaving town, overcoming her low self esteem and finding true love with a real man, not with the kind of male characters that Jodi Picoult usually creates, which seem to be very handsome and attractive but extremely stupid and airhead(for reference, see Salem Falls' Jack St. Bride and Second Glance's Ross Wakeman)."
3,Fell short...,"This one started out great-- very interesting characters with believable lifestyles and situations. (I love the controversial topic.) Then, it seemed to fall apart. Some of characters were merely introduced, not developed. And the ending left too many loose ends for me. I've read most of Picoult's books- this one fell short for me."
1,"Like Picoult's books, but not this one","I thoroughly enjoyed ""19 Minutes"" and ""My Sister's Keeper""; I could not put them down and found myself enthralled with the characters and Picoult's writing style. This book however, was a little odd. The premise of the story was good, dealing with a loving couple and euthanasia, but the other main couple, Cam and his wife Allie, were beyond unrealistic. He cheats on her, she takes him back quite easily and in very minimal time, and he seems a little cocky and annoyed that she would even think of leaving him----pretty unrealistic I would say. It seemed like the whole last part of the book where they got back together was too abrupt and would have been better if it had been more developed but I am not sure because Cam just seemed too full of himself and Allie so pathetic."
5,Talk about a tear-jerker,"My husband got me this book for my birthday last year. I loved it!! It's one of the few books I actually cried while reading. I passed it onto a few other people who also loved the book.If you like Piccoult, give it a try."
3,Not the best,This is the third Picoult book I've read and I have to say I was disappointed. The book did have some good parts but overall it lacked substance. I wouldn't read it again and I advise readers to pick another book instead.
3,Mercy,"Although not her best effort, still a Jodi Piccoult book, and that's about a good a read as you can get. You can get lost in the worlds she creates and forget about your own troubles. You know the characters intimately and can't wait to pick up the book again if you are interrupted in your reading, which is what fiction is meant to be. The characters in Mercy are a bit fuzzy, but still the story carries you along with it. It makes you think about how far you would go for someone you love..."
2,Should have put it down,"I knew early on that I didn't connect with the characters. I simply didn't care what happened to ANY of them! I just read on and on because I thought Jodi might off one of them at the end and that might make it interesting. I don't want to give any spoilers, but really the end was just as boring as the rest of the book. Not her best, and I have enjoyed some of her books."
1,gross.,"hated it. Disliked almost all the characters, especially Cam and Mia who I had absolutely no sympathy for and didn't want them to have a happy ending. They didn't really, but there was no real punishment for their actions. Very selfish people, hated how it ended. Love other Picoult novels, this one I skimmed over."
1,Didn't live up to my expectations,"This book was highly recommended to me, and I was particularly interested in the idea of a town than had kept the old overtones of the Scottish clan structure. I was disappointed. Although Picoult makes the characters very real, most are not likeable. There are two main story lines, one of a man who kills his suffering wife (at her request) before her cancer kills her, and one of a man who has an affair with a fresh young thing who also happens to be his wife's employee. At least the first storyline had some interesting twists and ethical dilemmas. The second was the ""same old-same old"" we've read before, or even lived through. I couldn't wait to give this book away."
2,A let down after My Sister's Keeper,"So, I was really excited to read Mercy because I loved the way she wrote My Sister's Keeper. I thought euthanasia would be terribly interesting, and it was at first. I loved Jamie throughout he novel and the fact he loved enough to kill. Then, I just got frustrated by Cam's unfaithfulness and Allie's reaction to his deception. Frankly, I got more than a little bored (about the whole Scottish heritage thing) and irritated at the same time. The book was not what I expected it to be.I was really disappointed."
5,Life-like,"When Ms Picoult writes, I fall head first into the story. I can not help it. She paints a picture of words that shows the very real lifes of her characters, as if it is happening before my very eyes. But, this story isn't quick and easy reading. Perhaps on one level it is. But, on the other hand, you must stop and ask yourself some very serious personal questions. I love her writing and this book was no different. I only wish she could write faster!!~d"
1,What a waste of talent!,"I've really enjoyed Jodi's books, having now read seven... until this one. Don't waste you time! I wonder about other reviewers who gave it good ratings. Did we even read the same book? After struggling to turn the pages, I gave up after 100, and quickly thumbed through the remainder... an unnecessary task. The theme of mercy killing is merely a background. It could have been about any emotional topic that engenders strong response. These characters are totally unlikeable, the rambling plot awkward and disjointed. It presents a poor picture of anything Scottish! I question if the author was presented dollars and a deadline to come up with 'something' and this was the best she could do. Had this been my first Picoult novel, it would surely have been the last"
1,Put me out of my misery,"Oh dear.. I thoroughly enjoyed the controversial subjects in ""Sisters Keeper"" and ""19 minutes"" -- but this book was painful. Couldn't finish it. I had renewed it twice from the library and when they wouldn't allow me to renew it once more, I was relieved. Don't know whether to try another one of Jodi Picoult's books or not."
2,"Eh, too long","Half of the book could have been cut out and nothing missing. Too much repetition, characters too one sided and shallow.affair between Cameron and Mia totally unbelievable and disgusting. He was a total jerk and very unlikable.not a book I would read again, glad I got it from the library."
3,just okay,I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult but this was not one of my favorite books. It took quite awhile for me to get interested in this book and all the ancient background and magical stuff made the story more boring instead of making it more interesting. A more straight forward handling of euthanasia would have made it more interesting. Also the handling of the affair was weird.
3,Cam's the only character who had relatives???,"Allie had grown up in the town and had gone to high school with Cam. Yet she had no relatives, and not even a friend in town? Her entire live revolved around Cam, his mother Ellen, and his uncle Angus. And what about Maggie and Jamie ... neither of them had any relatives either? No mother or father, no sister or brother, or even another cousin besides Cam? The lack of any other family around for a family that supposedly had come lock, stock and barrel from Scotland together seems very, very odd and makes this town in Massachusetts extremely unbelievable."
2,Not Going to Finish It,"I have read several Picoult books and really enjoy the author's storytelling and choice of subject matter. This book; however, has not captured my interest. The characters are not likable and after 150 pages I still don't see a story taking shape. There are too many more interesting books out there to struggle through this one so I am not going to finish. I'm glad this is a library book and I didn't purchase it."
1,very dissapointing- characters and plot too far fetched to believe,"I have very much liked several Jodi Piccoult books. But I am not even sure I can finish this one. A woman who is in the last stages of terminal cancer, making intense passionate love, and jitterbugging the night away on her last night of life??? As a nurse who has seen many terminal patients, let me tell you that does NOT happen anywhere in real life! The intensity of the ""love at first sight"" sub plot between the police chief and his wife's assistant was also a yawn. All the characters are flat, 2 dimensional, and totally unbelievable as real people. This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time."
2,Euro-Pro F2015L Cool Touch 1500-Watt Deep Fryer,"I just got this deep fryer in the mail the other day and I couldnt wait to use it, what a big disappointment. The next day I decided I would try something easy like a batch of french fries. The product sets up really easy and its pretty straight forward when using. The one and only problem that I have encounter which to me is a BIG PROBLEM is that each time I pulled the strainer out of the oil to empty the fries I had to reset the heating element. Its a pain since you have to lift the entire heating element out of the hot oil and press a button on the back of the unit. I made 3 batches of fries and each time I had to reset the switch. I guess we live and learn dont we. Personally I would not recommend this product."
4,We love this deep fryer!,"We have had our deep fryer for a little over a year and we use it several times a month. It works very well and is simple to use. The only problem we have had is that after about 9 months, the handle on the basket wouldn't hold in the raised position anymore, so we had to replace it. When we called the manufacturer, we figured that it would still be under warranty. It wasn't and we had to pay about $15 to have a new basket sent to us. Other than that, we have loved having this deep fryer!!"
2,Not without merit,I am not surprised by the unfavourable reviews (below) by Rodney Parnell and Lance Law. The two of them have always hijacked the agenda at meetings of the Proserpine Jethro Tull Appreciation Society. The album is not as bad as they consistently maintain.
2,Not up to par.,"Well...For what it's worth, I classify Tull releases into 3 categories---Classic, Good, and Not Up To Par.""Rock Island"" would fall in to the ""Not Up To Par"" category.The only memorable songs here are ""Kissing Willie"", a tongue in cheek (or is it a willie in cheek?) look at oral sex, by the always amusing Ian Anderson, and ""Another Christmas Song""---not as good as the original ""Christmas Song"", but still good. I find the rest of the songs quite forgettable.Still, not a horrible album. However, when you have released classics lile ""Aqualung"" and ""Thick As A Brick"", that still send chills up my spine over thirty years after their release, ""Rock Island"" is quite a disappointment. Those who feel this is one of their better releases, must not be familiar with what they accomplished on some of their other releases."
1,The blunt Mr Boule was right,"The instinct of the Jethro Tull fan, of whom I am one, is to nurture the band and protect it from pejorative comment. Particularly as unbelievers already abound, without our adding to their momentum through unfavourable reviews on Amazon. But, the truth must be told...this album is a howler."
1,Disappointing,"Oh dear. Fred, while a tireless worker in the Proserpine sub-branch of the Australian Jethro Tull Appreciation Society, has never been able to accept that his favourite band has had its weak moments. Don't be fooled by Fred's positive outlook. The album is a waste of money."
4,Rock Island hosts 3 Tull all-time classics,"Classics - Whaler's Dues, Rock Island, Another Christmas Song. These make my all-time Tull playlist.Good - Strange Avenues, Ears of Tin, Heavy WaterAverage - Kissing Willie, Undressed to KillSub par- Rattlesnake Trail, Big Riff and Mando. While musically ok, lyrically a bit on the hokey side...Perhaps the hardest rocking of all Tull albums."
2,Insipid and Average( probably deserves 2.5 stars),"This is one of those tull albums I listen to once in a while,just to listen to something offbeat .The music is Insipid and the album overall has an irritating, metallic quality about it.Ofcourse,the later part of the CD has some brighter moments in the form of Christmas song,Heavy Water,Whaler's Dues and Strange Avenues.Had this album come from some other Run of the Mill Rock band it would have been passed off as a good album.Ofcourse,it is not as bad an album as consistently maintained by the prosperine reviewers."
2,Not sure if it works,"I bought this product because my dog was eating grass non stop. I thought it was because her diet was not complete. After adding this to her food for over a month, I didn't notice any difference. Not even in her coat as some people claimed it would help. She still eats grass too. I'm not sure if it works to help stop grass eating but I'm sure it still provides additional nutrition to cheap food. Still, I probably won't buy it again."
1,extremely bad golf game,"golf games back in the day just were not that good. seriously 9 out of 10 golf games of the 90's were horrible, it wasn't until Hot Shots Golf, Tiger Woods and Mario Golf came along that Golf games started getting good. avoid at all costs."
1,Big Disappointment,"I'd been interested in trying this product for years, so I finally broke down and bought it. What a waste of money. The product not only had no impact on my hair, but it's a weird neon orange, runny goopy mess. Not a fan of Potion 9."
4,Hoopla is good fun,Hoopla is an interesting twist on the basic formula that Cranium uses in its games. Instead of competing against each other players work as a team and try to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out. The one downside of this game is that it is too hard for most kids under 13 or 14. But if you are playing with older teens and adults it is a lot of fun.
5,Lots of laughs and no competition between players,This is a really fun game - you and your friends against the clock. We went through the cards pretty quickly so we're waiting for the boosters!
1,Not typical MWOHs. You will be disappointed.,"I love Men without Hats. Over the years, I've collected all of their albums. They are definitely one of my favorite groups. However, I was extremely disappointed in this latest offering. It's not just that it's bad, it is so horrible that I've trashed it (I've NEVER done that with a cd before). To call it music is an insult to musicians. I don't know what made Ivan and the band produce this tragedy, but I hope that they get it together and can continue what was a grand tradition of quality work. Otherwise they should just hang it up."
2,I Was Left Wanting,"I am 41 years old, and have been a huge Tull fan since I was about 11. I probably have somewhat unique tastes among Tull fans in that I really don't like a lot of their early stuff, and really think their music took off with ""War Child."" That being said, I find ""Catfish Rising"" simply, well, BORING. It seems like the band is holding back, and the electric guitar is way too subtle. For example, the track ""When Jesus Came to Play"" could have been a monster if they just powered it up a little, but as it is, it's merely so-so. Plus, Ian Anderson sings in basically the same nasal tone on just about every track. Again my Tull tastes are undoubtedly unique, but I thought the band really uncorked it with ""Crest of a Knave,"" and I'd like to see them release another CD with as much power and energy."
3,TRACKING!,You guys need to make sure that is a tracking system set up for this. I want to know information on where my item is. It's ridiculous.
4,Worked for me!,"Great maintenance spray. this product will not restore if you are hoarse but, it works great to keep everything moist."
3,It may help,"This is one of several dry-mouth solutions I'm in the process of trying. I record audiobooks and so avoiding mouth clicks means less time spent on micro-editing. Farley's along with eating an apple, drinking apple juice, and using a dry-mouth rinse from my drug store, all help. So far I have not found THE solution."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased these mats because I was led to believe I could order a set specifically to fit my Nissan Frontier. They did not even come close! I had to use heavy-duty scissors to cut the mats to size. You are better off getting a much cheaper pair at your local auto parts store rather than buying these ill-fitting mats.
2,Nice but did not fit car as stated in the description,"These mats were pretty durable and nice looking espically for the price but they did not fit our H3 AT ALL and they were one of the vehicles listed in the description to fit our year model and make of Hummer H3. We returned and got our $55 back, I would rather pay a little more for the H3 specail made ones that fit the floor boards like they are made too fit."
3,Useful Reference,"Hiring great sales people is tough because almost every sales role in every company requires a different mix of experience, skills and personality traits. On top of that, too many people pose as sales professionals and misrepresent the truth about themselves. It would take a series of books to effectively demystify this topic and the average hiring manager is not a professional interviewer so this is a useful summary of the aspects to consider when hunting for the right person and qualifying that they are in fact what you need. The book`s authors also have real experience and a take no prisoners attitude- I expect it would be fun to work with them."
3,Not the same when Dave isn't doing it live,"Don't get me wrong, some of the lists are very funny, but it's missing something in book form because you're missing Dave's delivery. Also, a one-joke book gets kind of thin quick. I recommend only reading three or four lists at a time so the novelty doesn't wear off. Great bathroom reading."
4,Story of forgetfulness,"This book deals well with the beginning signs of ""forgetfulness"" in the elderly. A good book for your children to be able to develop an understanding and acceptance of grandparents and seniors."
3,A classic not without it's design flaws,"This is a good game for it's time that is worth trying out if only to learn from the design flaws that it's system has. If you are a dungeon crawler fan and are not afraid of frustrations, this is a great classic. The interface is awkward and some extra visual feed-backs on the state of the game would have been useful but it is still a fun game to explore and toy with."
2,PC RPG on the Super Nintendo,"If you are a fan of Dungeons and dragons, get this game. This game is not very recommendable due to its PC interface, which makes the game harder to play."
4,Brownie on the Orange Crate,"Readers of this little autrobiography will experience the charm of a delightful piece of Americana. Bernell Smith had no earth shaking experiences in her life, but those experiences she did have, she tells us about in a manner that makes the reader want to keep on reading. Her humor and evocative style will enchant readers young and old. A ""must-have"" for your bookshelf."
3,Soap opera quality,"I read this book while on vacation, and this book is fine as a way to while away a few hours while traveling. It's billed as being ""laden with secrets, scandals, deception, and betrayal,"" in other words as a soap opera, and if you approach it as you might approach As The World Turns, in other words willing to suspend disbelief and not being too demanding in terms of craft, The Man Pilot provides some entertainment and escape from reality. However, with dialogue that's a bit stilted and writing that does a bit too much telling instead of showing it's definitely a soap opera and not an Academy Award winning drama. That said, just as it's easy to get hooked on a TV soap opera, so could it be easy to get hooked on this series."
1,"Big disappointment, not worth the money","These were a Christmas gift specifically asked for by our sons, ages 11 & 13. What a disappointment! One of the robots didn't work no matter what we did or how many batteries we changed. The other one worked, I suppose, but the actions it performed were very limited and sluggish, and it, too, died after a very short period of time (about 20 minutes of frustrated use). Definitely NOT worth the money spent. We will be returning it and not replacing it. I'd give it less than one star if that were an option."
1,Defective,"I, too, experienced the robots smoking and malfunctioning. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I now have to figure out how to return it!! Very frustrating."
1,Up in Smoke,"A Christmas present for my grandson, he had anticipated this present for two months. The Red fighter began smoking immediately after it was switched on. For some reason after a few minutes it was again switched on and did work. However, the burning odor never dissipated. The Blue fighter functioned for about 15 minutes and then it too went up in smoke. ""Blue"" no longer functions.Trying to find a procedure to return this piece of junk has been a time consuming effort with no results to date."
3,ck watches,"I ordered a Calvin Klein Women's Contour watch #K3723409.the watch is really nice, only problem is I ordered it in balck band and instead they sent me one wiht brown band!"
1,Hooked on Library Skills,This book might have worked fine 10 years ago but now it is outdated. Hooked on Library Skills pays no attention to the electronic age and meets few of the standards required for information technology. Many lessons teach children about card catalogues rather than how to access electronic resources. There were few lessons I could use in this book to teach K - 5.
3,Outdated but still useful,"If you already have a strong lesson base, this probably is not for you. However, while this book is old (1988) and parts are outdated (film strips and card catalogs), as a new media specialist I found its organization and framework to be quite helpful and I used it as a basis in planning lessons for my school year. My district has no curriculum for media centers and nothing was left so I was faced with starting from scratch. This was one of the few books that I could find that is organized in the same way as I would use it, first by grade level and then by month. Plugging in the national standards and updating the outdated stuff was easy. I also saved a tremendous amount of time by using the ideas from their activity sheets as a basis for making activities to use on the SmartBoard."
1,Now what is this crap?!,"That's exactly what I thought when I first saw this: ""Now what is this crap?"" ANOTHER documentary? Nothing worth mentioning has happened since the last one. The Ozzy camp trying to out-KISS KISS now with all the redunant products? And the NAME! Just pure ridiculousness all the way around."
1,I love Ozzy but this is nothing special....,"If you were looking to get into the Ozzman with this, get his first 6 solo records and his first 6 albums with Black Sabbath. If you already have those great Lps than there is nothing for you here, the title of the dvd alone should show you this is some cash grab from Sharon. This dvd may be interesting to those who never heard the ozzy story before but everyone else should save their cash. How about finishing your sabbath collection? You may be suprised to find that you love Dio and Martin fronted Sabbath albums as much as the ozzy ones!"
3,"Disrespectful, forgetting people who got him there","A GREAT dvd, if all you want it the same old same old stories of Ozzy, his wild and crazy days, and nothing more.I've seen all that though, through news, etc.Ozzy wouldn't be anything without the likes of Randy Rhodes and Zakk Wylde, though, but each of these are trivialized in this. 2 decades later, you can STILL hear Wylde's influence in the man's work, yet, he gets 30 seconds of old footage? Really? Are you THAT upset at him? Ridiculous!!!"
3,Good film but nothing new for old-time fans,"Saw this movie at a special screening at a local theater in Sept-2011. As a true metal fan of nearly 30 years with a more than passing knowledge of Ozzy and Black Sabbath I found it rather boring. The movie, although well made and informative [to new fans], brings NOTHING new to the story of Ozzy and Sabbath. I realize it's not a documentary [which I would have preferred], but a study of the man behind the music. Unfortunately all the anecdotes and intimate moments the movie makers share with us are rehashes of things we've seen on The Osbournes TV show, Behind The Music specials, and 'behind the scene' spots from various Ozzy concert DVDs throughout the years. If you're new to metal and want to learn how Ozzy became the man he is now, this movie is for you, but for real fans who knew of Ozzy before his TV show, you can skip it."
3,Alright,"This was not what I expected for a 3D movie, I thought it would be more life like but it wasn't."
2,Red green glasses,Need I say more? This mades sense as a purchase if you don't have a 3d tv- otherwise is is a bit cheesy
3,Not much 3D,This movie does not contain much 3D content. It has a few scenes with 3D so if you are looking fora movie full of 3D don't buy this.
1,What a ripoff!,"I bought the Dutch / Belgian edition of this DVD. Using the supplied cardboard glasses, the 3D-effect is crap, you see everything double and blurred, the colors drained. The cover says ""playing time: 144 minutes"" - imagine my surprise when the film ends at 36'! The quality of the documentary itself is not on NG's usual level in these things and cannot compete with BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs and similar series. I love Peter Gabriel, but the ultra-sweet kitschy soundtrack doesn't help matters either. I'll return this thing to the shop."
1,Don't like it!,"Don't like this product. I thought it was a blu-ray 3D and, when I tried to want, I couldn't see, it gave me headache."
1,Don't waste your money,Got this movie to try out a new 120hz lcd tv. It did show things in 3d but even worse than in the 50's when 3d movies on the screen first came out and they were bad. Go for one of the new 240 - 600hz led tv's that are out now. You need the much higher refresh rate of the scanning to really experience the 3d effect. Those tw's also come with advanced optics (glasses) that enhance the experience.
2,National Geographic Sea Monsters in 3D,This is probably not a bad movis but it sure isn't the 3D that I hoped for. You can't use your active 3D glasses that came with you TV. You have to use the cheap paper ones that come with the movie and they are terrible. Had the discription told me that I would not have bought it. I should have known by the price.
5,"Excelente, el mundo 3D ya esta aquì!!!","Es un documental muy bien elaborado, y con la tecnologìa 3D se torna en toda una grata experiencia visual. Làstima que las gafas 3D de cartòn son un poco incòmodas, y serìa bueno saber si hay unas que funcionen igual pero de montura plàstica y màs còmoda. Es mi primera compra de una pelìcula 3D bluray, la recomiendo especialmente para los niños que les atraen los dinosaurios pues ilustra de una manera muy agradable la historia de los dinosaurio a partir de los hallazgos cientìficos. Es una buena compra"
2,Not as good as the BBC series,"I got this because I loved the BBC seriesWalking with Dinosaurs. However,National Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray] isn't quite as good as that series. Rather, it features clips of paleontologists digging for fossils, with scenes of the CG sea monsters interspliced. As such, it isn't as entertaining or exciting as the BBC series, which shows just the dinosaurs. If you want a great series on prehistoric sea monsters, check out BBC'sChased By Dinosaurs, which in addition to dinosaurs has a mini-series featuring sea monsters that is much longer thanNational Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray]. In the series, Nigel Marvin chases, and in turn is chased by, sea monsters from a variety of different time periods. It's both more entertaining and educational."
1,Not for your Samsung or other 3D TV,"I purchased the blu-ray version thinking that this would play perfectly on my new 50in Samsung 3d TV . Unfortunatley this turned out to be one of those red-blue 3D movies where you'd need to see it with the cardboard supplied glasses. The 3D effects are outdated and its just not that great after seeing some of the later movies with 3D effects.Actually shame on me for not reading the product details before buying it.but even with the supplied blue-red glasses on, the 3D effects are mediocre. The documentary is way too short and for the price i paid , it definitely feels like a rip-off."
1,NOT New Technology 3D......,"If you like 3D in Blue/Red colored glasses, this is for you. This is NOT for use in the new 3D movie technology (i.e. Samsung LED TV's)."
1,WARNING,Be very careful as this DVD is totally misleading its potential buyer.When they say it is a 3D movie in fact it is an Anaglyph red and blue 3D dvd and not a truepolarized 3D hence super low quality.So do not get fooled that those super big 3D letters as this is not a true 3D movie.Very misleading and disappointing from a company like National Geo to make use of a hypefor 3D product and lying big time to the product they are selling.
1,Story is great. But 3D is very poor.,I bought this 3d blu Ray because I have 3d tv. But 3d was very poor when it compared with other movie like alien vs monster.
3,Good Documentary bad 3D,"The documentary is very well done by itself, but the 3D and the old stereo color glasses don't make a good experience. Is better to see it as a normal blu ray."
3,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!,"i bought this thinking it was a blu ray 3d disc ((as advertised)) but it is DOES NOT go with the real 3d kits. it comes with cardboard blue and red glasses that strain your eyes and give you a head-ache. i tried using it with my active shutter glasses and it didnt work.yes, the pic is still ok, and looks 3d, just not what i was expecting. :(("
2,Nothing Great,"The 3d effects was nothing to shout about and so wasn't the documentry,In 2d,it was decent,but the 3d images were useless..Go pick up the Polar express 3d ,My Bloody Valentine 3d or Hannah Montana 3d"
2,Kept me interested,"This is an old 3D technology and is not compatable with the new 3D TV's that are out. However, we watched the 2D version and thought the quality was still very good, clear and interesting."
2,National Geographic: Sea Monsters-A Prehistoric Adventure,"The content of this 3D is very good. However, it requires the green/red glasses; only two were included. These glasses were quite difficult for viewing. Apparently, it was not quite dark enough in the room which resulted in a bad glare. It was suggested making an adjustment on the TV for brighter viewing which I haven't figured out how to do yet. I will try this 3D again. My LG TV uses same colored lenses and 3D viewing has been very good, easy and enjoyable on all my other 3D's. Is this 3D available in another format that would be compatible with LG glasses?"
3,"Without active 3D option, good for children","Good presentation, beautiful images.I miss an option for active 3D with shutter glasses. With the reb-blue glasses included (4) the experience is amazing, but i would like to watch it with active technology."
1,Sea Monsters 3-D,"""A Prehistoric Adventure"" was more of""A Prehistoric Adventure in poor photography.The 3-D effect was usually present but thefilm looked as if it was filmed in the dark.Most disappointing."
1,Unfoirtunate,I really thought this was going to knock my socks off but there's only one song worth it's weight. The rest was very disappointing. Don't buy the CD....not worth it.
5,Funny As,Jonathan Creek is one of the most funnies mystery show out there with Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin as the main star you can understand why.And despite that they don't have many episodes on series one I still think its one of best comedy mystery to come out of UK.
5,The Best Tull Album,"Jethro Tull have put out so many great albums in their long carrers. In my opinion I would have to say that Songs From the Wood is prabrably their best. It rates up in my top five albums. 1. Quadrophenia, The Who 2. Songs From the Wood, Jethro Tull 3. Crash, Dave Matthews Band 4. Tommy, The Who 5. Blood On the Tracks, Bob Dylan"
5,Brilliant Album,"""Songs From The Wood"" was sort of a strange album to me at first, since all the reviews had raved about it being brilliant. When I first listened to it, I was NOT completely blown-away, and a little disappointed. But after many listenings (hundreds by now!), I have realized what all the fuss is about this album. This is a brilliant work of amazing music and imagery, one that begins to reveal itself over a period of time (like many great albums). There are so many subtleties, that one doesn't truly begin to ""understand"" this album until multiple listenings. Ian's music is truly brilliant, and the lyrics alone are beautiful poetry. I own the ""Original Master Recording Gold CD"", and while it sounds fine indeed, I believe this album and many other Tull records are in dire need of remastering. Still buy it, it's amazing!"
5,It does make me feel much better!,"You can smell the green grass. You can take some fresh-cold air. You can have a walk among the trees, smell the wet ground and put all your troubles away. Suddenly, ""SONGS FROM THE WOOD"" is ending. You open your eyes and find yourself back at home, in the dirty-noisy city, with all the bills around, and the CNN is bringing you some more hot news of the real world."
3,a remission,"This is probably the best Tull since ""A Passion Play"", but that's not saying much: Ian Anderson never fully recovered his artistic self-confidence after his critics maliciously savaged that brilliant record. Its follow-up included the cynically conceived vapid hit single ""Bungle in the Jungle"", precursor of ""Songs from the Woods""'s ""The Whistler"". The remaining music and lyrics here are pleasant but un-inspired. If you already own Tulls from ""This Was"" to ""A Passion Play"" and desire more, buy this. Otherwise, hold off.Recommended: ""This Was"", ""Stand Up"", ""Benefit"", ""Aqualung"", ""Thick as a Brick"", ""A Passion Play"", and Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"", a method book."
4,even crazy dave loves it!,"i don't know (yet) how the cd sounds, but back in the dark ages i had this album on vinal (ok that's misspelled-it's been like twenty years, ok?) anyway, i was recently reminded of this recording when the afore mentioned crazy dave started singing it at work. i loved it back then, and i hope i'll love it again (if i'm not haunted by visions of dave)"
5,"The first album I ever purchased, age 13, circa 1977","I remember getting on my bike one day after school in 1977, riding the three miles to the local mall, and shelling out pocket-fulls of change to get this album, the first I ever bought. Now, hundreds of records, tapes, CDs, and Minidiscs later, it still holds a treasured place in my collection (though now in CD form).I love it as much now as the first time I heard it...in fact, it's only gotten better over the years. The music is an amazingly appealing mix of rock, folk, and Celtic-influenced elements, all driven by Anderson's remarkable poetic lyrics. Each track is a separate wonder in itself, full of surprises, humor, and consummate artistry.Now, all these years later, my kids are discovering this masterpiece for themselves. This truly is a timeless work of art."
4,A good deal!,"I got this as my kid's high school graphing calculator. Works just fine, and about 1/3 the cost of the ones the teacher recommended."
2,Not satisfied with the calculator.,It works but the display and the key symbols are hard to read at angle.Must look straight down at it. No factorial key.
2,May not be what you need,I purchased this Casio because it was a lot cheaper then a TI83/84. In it's advertising it says it does the same functions but I am finding that it does not. When it does do one of the functions it is off by it's rounding or it doesn't come up with the same type of answer (different form like decimal) which I have to then translate to the correct form. For me it was not worth the price break.
1,are you serious,"If I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a joke. Whoever wrote this book thinks like an 8th grader and writes like a 3rd grader. As I turned the pages, I was waiting for a popup. Does this book come with crayons? Glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it."
1,rolling stones tribute,this album sucked. it sounded like every track was by the same whining folk pop singer whoever she is. Just awful.
5,beautiful!,"I grew up with the Playmobil Victorian dollhouse, and only recently did I start collecting other Playmobil sets. I bought this Fairy Tale Castle about a month ago and had the greatest time putting it together. The assembly directions include another building variation that seems to be a little more spacious, if you're planning to fit all the furniture sets in. Unlike the victorian dollhouse, this one is totally sturdy. I've moved it several times with no problem. And the accesory sets are incredible.I recommend getting this item from Amazon.com while they have free shipping in the States. I have had problems finding toys by this company in every toy store I've been to, and having it shipped directly from Europe is extremely pricey!!"
2,prepare for it to be taken apart after all your hours putting it together,"We got this for our almost 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it, but it is like Lego and the pieces to the castle come off very easily. With just a little bit of play, the pieces come off and get lost easily because they are so small. We spent hours putting it together and it is frustrating to have it taken apart so easily. I have been keeping the pieces that she takes off but right now we don't feel like putting it back together just to have it taken apart again. We wish it would be more permanent once it is together."
5,hecho en cielo,"""hecho en cielo"" if my spanish is correct. the size is not too big, not too small, just right. chocolate's only enemy is the sun. keep em away from sun if you're on munching binge.from 1 to 10 ratings, i'll give it a 9.5."
5,Excellent Investment,"Very satisfied with its repeatability and compactness. This is a light weight scale. It is not a heavy duty industrial scale.The light weight SS pan slips off for easy cleaning. Functions with either a power cord or on batteries.Although the scale is very repeatable, like any other analytical device, you will need to invest in a couple of calibration weights."
3,Good for the price,"The coupler allows you to connect two fibre optic cables to extend them. It works well, however I noticed that the signal is lost when a device with a weaker transmitter is used with this coupler. It shouldn't be a problem for most people, unless you are planning to use this with a computer."
2,Its okay,"I re-wired my TV and dropped the cables down the back, however the cable I used was too short and the electrician had left.I ended up buying this and another line.It works but the signal is lost somewhat. Watching movies can be difficult to understand all the dialogue.I think I'm gonna have to drop a longer wire down the back of the wall.Like I said, it works but it's not gonna be grade-a stuff, ya dig?"
3,The City Was Not Enough,"In Final Fight 1, newly elected Mayor Mike Hagger took on the streets of Metro City. Now he's out to take on the world. Metro City's favorite wrestler-turned-mayor is back to save Guy's fiance and future fahter-in-law with the help of Guy's future sister-in-law Maki, and Carlos, an ex-con whom Hagger somehow helped out. Oddly enough, Guy makes no appearence except for a power-up figurine and a picture in the intro.Now there is a two-player mode and two new characters on the scene. The Graphics are slightly better in some ways than SNES's first Final Fight, the music is a bit of a let-down, and Maki looks drop-dead gorgeous. That's about the gist of it.Finally, let me just go on record: in case you have been wondering if anything was taken out of the U.S. version of Final Fight 2, the answer is yes. Like Final Fight and Final Fight Guy for the Super Famicom, the Japanese version Final Fight 2 included at least two female thugs."
2,"Great bracket, junk strap","These brackets are nicely finished and easy to adjust and use. The included straps have a really nice padded surround on the buckle, but the buckle itself is totally unsafe. It feels secure, but very easily releases suddenly even when you hold the cam hard against the strap when tightening. Very inferior to our favorite brand buckle, which has sharper teeth."
4,Jeep Patriot fitment,"Just a heads up, these will not fit stock Jeep Partiot cross bars, wrong shape. I can not blame Amazon for this as I failed to check with the manufacture prior to purchase. The required cross bars and towers are around $175 to make them fit. No big deal, I went back to the foam blocks until something better and affordable comes along. I gave them four stars because they look like they would work just fine, just not on stock Jeep Patriot racks."
4,"Not an exciting color, but a great performer","Much like the Namiki green, this is not the most exciting purple. It's one of the dullest purples I've ever used. There's no shading or complexity. Of the four purples I've tried - Namiki, Herbin, Skrip, and Levenger, I like Levenger's purple best and Namiki's the least.Also, like Namiki's green, it's slightly bluer than I would like. Many people would find this to be a plus, though, and it's just a matter of taste.Like the green, it is a well-behaved ink. It plays nicely with most papers and doesn't bleed through readily. It flows well from both my fine Pilot 78 and my Plumix and washes out of the pen easily."
2,bad batch?,"I've used this ink in three different vanishing point pens and a plumix. It does not flow at all. The minute I switched back to regular blue or black, the pens were fine. Either this is a bad batch or watch out for the colored inks. Similar problems occurred using the green ink."
5,Finally re-released in 2011,This is a wonderful book and it is now finally being re-released in May or June of 2011. It's about time! Yay!
1,Overpriced and not particularly informative,You could get all this information from either the internet or one of many other paperback books.Nothing new here all common sense and intuitive.Please don't waste your money on this one.
4,I like this and plan to order more as we get closer to summer,"This Hawaiian Tropic Glow Daily Moisturizer is generously sized compared to similar products. In my experience, it is easy to blend and is effective. It's not too dark... makes a nice tan after about 4 or 5 applications. Odor is not unpleasant. When you get to the end of the tube use, cut the tube with scissors and you can get remaining product out of the packaging (a way to get the last of it and enjoy another application!)"
4,very subtle sunless tanner,"I really like this product, the reason for only 4 stars is the smell. This is a very subtle sunless tanner which I like a lot. It doesn't leave me orange, and it doesn't take too long to dry. The smell isn't bad, just a sunless tanner smell. I think if there was more of a tropical fragrance in there it would be perfect."
2,"Inappropriate for the Baby/Preschool age, as recommended","I was disappointed with ""Spot's Birthday Party"" because the format was totally inappropriate for the Baby/Preschool age-group I searched/purchased under. The inside pages are paper (which, believe it or not, isn't an issue even tho I have 2-year-old twins). The problem isn't the paper, per se, but that it's paper pages WITH FLAPS for the kids to open and close. My kids are gonna want to open those flaps, and since the pages/flaps are flimsy paper instead of cardboard, those flaps are going to stay on for only two or three readings--max. [Suggestion: the only lift-the-flap books that you recommend for this age-group should be cardboard books with cardboard pages.]"
3,Just another spot book,I have decided to buy a book for my son each year for his birthday. The first year I got Birthday Monsters by Sandra Boynton. It was great and he loves it. For his second I decided on Spot as he loves dogs. I thought that this book would have more to do with a birthday. It was more of a hide and seek book for spot. The last page did randomly say Happy Birthday. It is not a bad book and the flaps are fun but it is definitely not what I was expecting. I ended up buying another for his yearly book.
3,Its spots birthday,its spots birthday every one and he is having some friends over and they decide to play hide and seek he finds bear be hind the curtin snake is hiding in the cabnit but he cant seem to find monkey then he finds him and they party Happy Birthday Spot
4,good but there are better remakes; the SNES version is for a certain kind of gamer,"As much as I love this game, it is no where near perfect. If you are a fan of SNES-era RPGs, I would consider this a must-play, and almost certainly a must-own. If you are simply a fan of RPGs or the Final Fantasy series, I would recommend either of the two Nintendo-console remakes--Final Fantasy IV Advance for the GBA Advance or Final Fantasy IV DS for the NDS. Both games have superior translations as well as the readdition of items and spells which were removed from the game when it ported from the Super Famicom to the SNES. Their graphical styles are different, however, as well as their ""bonus content"" and difficulty (the GBA game feels easier than even the SNES version--largely due to the extra content--while the NDS game is harder than both).I heartily advise against the PSX version of the game, which has abominable load times and an unremarkable translation."
4,Good classic game,"This was actually the fourth installment of the Final Fantasy series released in Japan, but as numbers 2 and 3 didn't make it to America, this was marketed as FF2 before its debut on the American SNES.Having played the original a couple of times, I really enjoyed this game. You can easily get this game on an emulator and play on your computer, but I highly recommend this game for the Game Boy Advance (Final Fantasy IV Advance) because the Advanced version is basically the same as the game, but control has been smoothed out and additional dungeons put in. But even before it was updated for the Advance, this was a great game, and is a true Final Fantasy classic."
3,Final Fantasy part 2,"I've never been able to enjoy the Final Fantasy series as much as most people. The storyline is quite big and the turn based action is decent, but it just leaves me underwhelmed when the game is finally over. In Final Fantasy II, the graphics aren't that great. Even when the game was popular the graphics never looked that great, in my opinion. I don't know, everyone loves Final Fantasy and I guess I have no choice but to recommend it to any fan of RPGs. Just remember that better graphics have come along since the early 90's, and featuring better-looking graphics is the best direction an RPG game can take."
5,2nd best game,i think ff2 is the 2nd best game besides ff1 on the nes for anybody who has played it will understand. this game is so fun that you can beat it over and over with out getting bored. I will never plan to sell this game because it is so rare now and it is pretty much priceless. the music in the battles is awesome and it is way better to have random battles then to see your opponent coming to attack. random battles provide you with the chance to level up for ever. most beg rpg players like to run away from monsters and therefor they do not gain levels and can not move on in the game. so basically the graphics are awesome the music is boss and the gameplay is priceless and the story line almost matches up to final fantasy 3. the only thing that could make the game better is the cute and adorable mog.
4,This an epic great game!,this one heck of an rpg you'll be up at midnight playing this after this awesome experience you should consider getting the sequel final fantasy 3!which is also really awesome!Also check out skies of arcadia
5,Awesome,"The story in this game is definitely the best out of all of the FF games. The scope, spectacle and score of the game speaks to the incredible imagination of the creators. It should be made into a movie! (motion picture not anime)It would be a great epic worthy of an academy award. Perhaps ten or so games stick out in my mind from the SNES that are worth having, this one is in the top five."
2,CRM or customer service?,"I bought this book willing to find essentials about CRM as a Philosophy as a System not by pieces. I cannot qualify this as a coherent book about CRM but as a compilation of eight articles of eight valuable authors writing about Relations with Customers not CRM as an integrated system of Human Resources, Technology and Philosophy into an organization's life. If you see this book as a group of articles gathered to give you different points of view about customers and service (not CRM) this is a good book, if you buy it considering the title ""Customer Relationship Management"" and ""Harvard Business Review"" it will not full your expectations.Nevertheless I have to recommend the article written by Fournier, Dobscha and Mick about preventing the premature death of Relationship Marketing. Very interesting point of view."
1,Extremely low level - disappointment!,"I ordered 5 books including this one, and all of them are so very shallow, low level and boring.Some of the chapters were actually copied in several books! Unbelivable.I would probably recommend this series to school children interested in management - nothing more than that."
3,good but insufficient snapshots,The book is compilation of several decent articles or essays on CRM but one thing that it obviously misses out is the technology and IT section which would be a nice and helpful content to have for newbie or people in general who would like to know quite a bit of everything about CRM.
1,Horrible Game with no Point,"I admit I was a fan of the Home Alone movies, but the games it was the exact opposite. all Home Alone games have been junk none worth playing. 1 star."
5,In A Japanese Garden,Marvelously contemplative. A few minutes spent with this meditative writing will transform your mood!
3,somewhere in the middle --,"I found this book engaging enough. It is not an Elvis biography, more a commentary on pop culture and perception. Marcus is a solid writer and his points are well-founded, especially the chapter in which he deconstructs Goldman's scathing bio 'Elvis'. As another reviewer has suggested, you will need to know some about Elvis' story before you get your head around everything in this book. Having said that, it's not as grave as that reviewer made it out to be. I don't consider myself an Elvis follower by any stretch and I didn't feel out of place understanding what Marcus was conveying. A solid, quick read that even the most casual of Elvis fans will enjoy."
1,absolutely impenetrable,"I have a Ph.D., and most of the time I had no idea what Marcus was talking about. Not because of the academic jargon -- there is little or none. Because he kept dropping in names of obscure punk rock groups or fan mags or ezines and expecting me to know all about them, he kept starting discussions in the middle, and most infuriating, he assumed that readers positively worshipped Elvis, so if he alluded to what happened in Tupelo in 1957, or Elvis' relationship with his cousins, we would nod and say ""oh, sure."" Casual readers, beware -- in order to understand this book, you need to have read at least a dozen biographies of Elvis, watch all of his movies a dozen times, and have every word of every song he ever wrote memorized. I conclude that it's not a cultural obsession at all, to anyone but the author."
5,Very good book,"This book, because of the timeline, gave me a better feeling of the days involved in finishing the trail than any other book I have read on the Oregon Trail thus far."
5,Must Have,"What do you say about a power cord? In this case, it's a very nice item to have. One of the reasons to use a cordless nailer is that there is no power at the job site. This little power cord allows you to charge the battery from your truck. My only ""complaint"" is that for the price of the Paslode guns, they should include this cord with the kit."
2,Not written in a reader-friendly way,"The author knows a lot about the accounting principles mentioned in the book, but he has forgotton that he is writing a textbook, not a novel. He has written too much and has failed to make good use of diagrams or tables to illustrate some concepts which are too difficult to grasp when expressed only in words."
1,Dog broke it within a week,"We have a 45-lb Brittany and this was the only water bowl designed for a crate that was available at our local PetSmart so I decided to try it. Well, here we are a week later with a broken bowl. He broke the bracket that secures the bowl to the crate. Next time I'll get one made of metal."
5,A make believe build-a-bear,"My granddaughter loves the BULID-A-BEAR shop. So for her birthday, I ordered his bear so she can build one herself. She was very pleased & excited to do herself. Thanks for all you do @ Amazon.com, you really are a life savior, when you can't find something anywhere you can go on Amazon.co. Thanks, Ms. Stephens"
1,recipe for a rash,"unfortunately the sun block gave my 19 month old a rash wherever I used the product. She is very fair and must have super sensitive skin. I've asked for a refund, but got no response as of yet."
4,So far so good,"My infant (now 7 months) has very sensitive skin. Constantly am putting lotion and other creams on her skin - excema etc problems. This sunscreen has been great for her so far - no allergic reactions and I love that it doesn't ""SMELL"" like normal ""sunscreen"". Only complaint is that it is so expensive vs. other ""cheaper sunscreens"" but my baby is worth every penny!"
3,"love the product, but not what i ordered","this is the only brand of sunscreen my baby can use, but unfortunately it's not what i ordered...!i ordered the blue lizard baby, but received blue lizard sensitive. we were leaving on vacation the next day, so i had to use it, as i can't find it in stores here.the tag on the back of the container even said blue lizard baby...just labeled and shipped the wrong product! luckily, he didn't have a reaction to it, so it worked out fine...just need more attention to detail!"
3,a wealth of ideas,"I got this book from the point of view of graphic design, and found it very rewarding. The book pays attention to the details of buildings, and the overall needs of the client, discussing how they arranged structures to fit the landscape, and compliment them, or how they created traffic thru-flow of people, how they encourage people into the buildings and around them. There are so many ideas in this book, it's well worth getting your hands on."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected a book full of pictures of actual buildings. Instead I opened the book to find computer renderings and models of buildings. There were only a couple of pictures of existing architecture. Morphosis is great. They have some of the most brilliant architects working for them, but the book did not show me the work they are famous for."
1,glow,tthis is the worst product ever isnt bright n doesnt work tought it away within the first hr i had it couldnt even see the light or the pulse action.........strongly sugest u dont buy it biggest waste of money
4,Straight from the Horses Mouth,"In response to the ""Watch out, Bad snake oil"" review which stated that bacillus licheniformis and bacillus subtilis are classified as pesticides by the EPA according to the National Institute of Health....I went straight to the horses mouth and looked these up on the National Institute of Health website and found that they are both listed under Risk Group 1. Risk Group 1 is the category of ""agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans"" (NIH). Anyone who is interested in seeing for themselves can do a search at their website (www.4.od.nih.gov)."
1,Self serving?,So why is it that many of his concoctions can only be purchases through him and now some of his products are unavailable because they are under investigation for claims? Not impressed!
3,Not good format for Kindle and recipes required expensive equipment,"The book was comprehensive in the latest theories of health and weight management. I incorporated one suggestion he made, but it is too early to know if it is successful.However, the frustrating part of this Kindle edition is that his food regimens were in such small font that I would have needed a magnifying glass to read them. Even with my glasses on, they were mice type and unreadable. Further, the recipes that had been touted highly and were one of the main reasons I purchased the book, required an expensive VitaMix and/or a dehydrator. Without the required equipment, they were just a list of ingredients.Bottom line, I have not felt that the book was very useful in the Kindle format. I would not recommend it to friends without telling them of my reservations."
2,Unbelievable,Really nothing new. The story of him being stranded in Germany and no one speaking English at the airport is fiction. You can't even work for an airline unless you speak English. What nonsense drama.
4,"A Good Challenge to Start Eating, Exercising, and Thinking Right","Rubin was written what I think is a helpful book on pursuing a healthy lifestyle with a Christian perspective. While some reviewers may disagree with some of his conclusions, overall the book is a helpful title.I particularly enjoyed reading the following sections:1. His own personal struggle with good health.2. Various ways to get sick by practicing certain habits.3. How thinking can affect your overall mental and physical health.4. Appropriate ways to exercise without harming your body.5. Particular types of healthy foods to eat and foods to avoid.While I do not intend to follow all of his suggestions, I certainly plan to implement some strategies, namely, the types of foods to eat and avoid and types of appropriate exercise.Be encouraged and challenged to get off your couch and do something positive about your mental and physical health. Recommended."
5,The Maker's Diet,I found this book not only spiritually lifting but also a diet plan intended to get those who read back into the youthful and healthy life God intended us all to have.
1,Cashing in on the Christian Market for PROFIT!,"I found this author's blatant attempt to copy the marketing campaigns of other successful science based diets--without himself having any credentials in science or medicine--offensive. But worse is his apparent lack of respect for the Christian Marketplace. He seems to believe that if you throw a bible reference into any product, we'll dash out and mindlessly purchase the product. I highly doubt that ""The Maker"" had his own line of supplements and I don't believe that Icelandic cod-liver oil was ever mentioned in the bible. That said, eating a healthy, whole foods diet is certainly a good idea, but not a new one. This ain't A Purpose Driven Life."
2,"just another ""good"" diet book and eating plan","I was disappointed in the book, it just didn't have the ""meat"" I was expecting. It's just another ""good"" diet book and eating plan."
2,Not as expected.,I bought this book on a recommendation. It was not as expected. I found his ''off the wall'' ideas not to my life style. Might be good others however.
5,A Really Great Book!,This is a very good book and makes perfect sense. It's a diet that actually works. What an amazing story also.
3,not convinced,"I just lost 75 pounds, without spending a fortune on merchandise. I still have a little bit more to go and I'm sure I will reach my goal."
4,The Maker's Diet,"This is a great book, especially for anyone that has suffered with digestive issues... I have not, but I want to be more healthy and I believe that Jordan Rubin is on to something... check it out, on Amazon I was able to buy the book for a few dollars, what a deal!"
4,A Great Intro to Healthy Eating,"I love Jordan Rubin's Garden Products and his integrity to help those heal themselves. Diet is vital and if you're an atheist and/or not a Christian, don't be offended by the biblical references - just take them and verified them from a scientific standpoint. If this is your first time venturing into the world of whole healthy food eating, start with this book."
5,Great Book !,"Great book ! This is not another fad diet, it introduces the reader to a way of living that can really change your life. The 40-day health program is intended to get your momentum for living a truly healthier life and achieving your optimal weight."
5,For dieters and health minded people,I was captured by the book's emphasis on spirituality and how our digestive system is the focal point of our health. This is a very good book and health program.
2,Good food basics,"If you haven't yet learned that sodas and sugar are bad for you, and more veggies are good, then hey, this is the book for you. While Rubin makes some excellent points, such as WHOLE honey having minerals and enzymes that can be lost in the heating process to refine it, he fails to point out the dangers of honey to pregnant women and small children. This may not sound like much, but then consider how many other things he may be failing to tell you about, or over emphasizing.Overall, the book is fine, with a few interesting recipes and discussion on how your lymph system works and how to best manage your intestinal health. However, I could have happily done WITHOUT him constantly pushing his company, his products, and the products of his friends (from whom I'm sure he gets a nice little kick-back). Take it all with a grain of salt, and it's fine, but frankly there are better books to read, such as Nourishing Traditions, Wild Fermentation, and Raw Food; Real World."
2,Dissapointed,"OK .. upfront I will tell you that I do use Jordan Rubins products, it is hard to find whole food supplement and this is why I gave it 2 stars. However, I was dissapointed in this book. For the general public this will be of use to them in cutting through some of the stuff out there and move toward healthy eating. What I found so upsetting was what I held in my hand was an INFOMERCIAL for the $200 package of material that you need to FULLY understand and implement Jordan's findings. There is just enough info to make you curious and then he referrs to to another book or product for the details. Not that helpful for those of us who have been working at our health for awhile. If you want a starting point, this may help but be prepared to do your own research or spend a lot of money for ""the package"" at the end of the book."
1,Never gives you the whole story.,"After reading ""Patient Heal Thyself"" I was looking forward to this book to pull everything together and make it simple and organized. A sort of reference book. It doesn't do that. The first half of the book is a boring world history and medical lesson that could have easily been covered in a short chapter or two. Then, when you do finally get to the heart of the program you have to go search all over the internet to find out what you really need (Clenzology?, Aromatherapy?, Functional Fitness?) only to be led to some other video, book, potion, or pill that you need to buy. This book is more ""headline teaser"" than solid information. VERY FRUSTRATING! Just pick your groceries from the edges of the store, skip anything overly processed, get some good whole food cookbooks, cook, and enjoy. Good Luck!"
2,Not for everyone,The problem with this book is it assumes everyone has the same problems as the author. I gained weight because of all the dairy fat and wound up with gall bladder problems. Mercola's book is better since it addresses people like myself who are a carbohydrate type.
1,this dude is fake,his ph.d is something he got from a fake institute in southeast asia or somethingi don't exactly remember but it was on TVyou can't trust the authorwhy would you trust his diet?
1,A book of distortion,"I wonder if Jordan Rubin has been bought by special interest groups in order to so strongly advocate the consumption of meat and negate the value of a meatless diet. His book is loaded with blatant contradictions and dis-information about previously established and proven health principles. Furthermore, he has chosen to attach this extensive body of deception to Christianity, a safe, popular and profitable thing to do in today's ever-increasing puritanistic society. I pray for the readers who are unable to see through this book of deception!"
2,Go ahead--make Jordan RICH,"The only thing you will lose if you follow this diet is that green paper you keep in your purse/wallet. All you're doing is making Jordan Rubin rich. Besides, the notion that certain foods are ""unclean"" is, like...SOOO Old Testament (remember: the New FULFILLS the Old---ALL foods are considered CLEAN by this New Covenant). Besides, some of the foods he suggests in this diet are outright NASTY (example: ""biogurt""---YUUUUUUCK).Stay away from the Maker's Diet. Eat what you need in the right amounts, and eat what you want in moderation."
2,Defense of Daniel L Edelen,"This is in defense of an excellent and informative review written by Daniel L Edelen. See his review if you are considering purchasing this book, then use your own judgement. It appears that other reviewers simply don't like his opinion. Fine. Beautiful. I wish more people would write reviews like he does. Honestly.Mr. Edelen is obviously a Christian who is very familiar with scripture. If in doubt, please read his other reviews. How can one question another's faith with the following statement? ""It has already been mentioned that you need to read the entire chapter of Mark 7 to understand what Peter was talking about.""Easy solution. Read Mark 7. Most notably read Jesus' Word in Mark 7:14-23. I know the answer. You will as well."
1,Doesn't make sense really.....,"Well I will say this, he has the right idea. I truly believe a lot of our nutritional questions can be answered in the bible. Its more than likely the best nutritional book ever written, its just not written in big and bold black caps like many would want. I haven't even read this book and probably wont cause if the book is called Makers Diet, why not just read the bible, the word from the actual maker? Reading this is like going to karaoke night when you can go see the actual artist perform in concert."
4,Enlightened,I am very enlightened by everything I have learned from this book. All the things the FDA and health advocates don't want you to know. I have learned more about what all the diet foods have done to my body over the years. I have not taken any antidepessants or allergy pills in almost a month now. The Hygeine Kit helps so much with allergies. I have lost weight too. I can go outside for an extended period of time if I use the hygeine kit. I am so blessed. I have not had any problems with the IBS I was told I have since I started this journey. It is not just a diet is is a new way of life that can help anyone. I can also walk without having to keep my feet propped up for days. This is great knowledge to help in keeping the Temple of the Holy Spirit is the best shape I can. Thanks
5,Good for all,"The principles of the Maker's Diet can be proven through science and history without the Bible. It just goes to show that our Maker is the source of supreme wisdom. Churches everywhere need to embrace this message so they can be an example of good health to all and not continue to suffer with the rest in this fast paced culture that has lost sight of health and turned their focused on the almighty dollar. To all parents - quit feeding your kids garbage and give them some real food, you know like meat, dairy, grain, fruits and vegetables, not fast food and microwaveable meals."
5,It helps !!!,"Life seems to crumple when you have to go to the bathroom every 10 minutes. After seeing endless doctors, this is the way I continued to lived until I was recommended Jordan Rubin's previous book, Patient Heal Thyself. I read about his recovery and started taking supplements from Garden or Life. It is truly a miracle what nature's ingredients and God's diet can do in restoring your digestive system. I am now a huge fan and advocate of his philosophy. I am a very enthusiastic person and I believe that going back to the Biblical ways of eating will extend into the mainstream.....I'd love to be a part of that."
2,Not much substantiated,"I have to admit I wanted to love this book - it had the makings of a wonderful book. It's just that, when compared to other publications similar to this one, The Maker's Diet just failed to support it's claims. Not to mention it takes biblical references out of context and doesn't really rely too heavily on those either.Considering this is supposed to be a Bible based diet, I found very little biblical reference.Also, I began to feel that this was just a storefront for Rubin's line of supplements that he sells on his website (which, by the way, NEVER mentions the Bible at all).I opted to put this one down and pick up ""What the Bible Says About Healthy Living: Three Biblical Principles That Will Change Your Diet and Improve Your Health"". It is much more sensible and has support for its claims."
5,"Great plan for changing your diet permanently, regaining health","In January, my husband was told his cholesterol and blood pressure were too high. His cholesterol was 241. He was already exercising 5 days per week and we were on a ""fairly"" healthy diet. I ordered this book, we did what the book said, ten weeks later my husband's cholesterol was down 99 points!!! (He was also put on a very low dose of cholesterol meds at that time)Our doctor was so impressed, he called me himself to tell me the good news! If you will do this plan for the rest of your life, you will definitely improve your health, general well-being. Easy to do really, you just replace your junk food, eating out with buying organic, the expense is about the same!"
1,God and Rubin's diet,The whole book is about eating foods as natural as God made them. Then the kicker is to add in expensive supplements that Jordan Rubin is making a fortune on. The inconsistency there bugs me. I tried the Hso miracle when he first started selling and it didn't do a thing for me.I would be more convinced of his spiritual principles if his supplements were affordable.There was nothing new in this book and I'm surprised that Dr Mercola recommended it.
5,Solid sound nutritional and health advice,"Any serious student of nutrition and health will recognize the wisdom in this book. He looks at nutrition from a holistic viewpoint using the Bible as a basis and also corroborating biblical recommendations with current knowledge and science. Yes he does offer his products through this book, but he also has an extensive list of where to get good, wholesome, real food from many other sources. The appedix alone is worth the price of the book! Excellent advice and sound reasoning and science. Very well done!"
5,Great book!,"After reading this book, I took away so many ideas that make sense to me. His approach to food eaten in Bible days especially makes sense."
5,The Maker's Diet,"Great book-very enlightening and informative! Rubin reveals that God's word provides a guideline for the proper diet. It is full of information, but quick reading."
5,Great,Great! Exceeded my expectations! Greatest thing I have ever ordered. Arrived promptly. No problems at all. Will continue to shop on amazon!
5,a change of lifestyle and well worth it,"The book provides a 40-day health program with daily instructions on what to eat, what not to eat, prayer, excercise, and the whole formula that is part of The Maker's Diet. I started this three weeks ago and I feel great that is why I am recommending this to other people."
2,A big disappointment,"I received this book as a birthday gift from my family, and I figured I'd give it a shot. My parents were really excited about the book, as they had see Rubin on several shows plugging the book. Unfortunately though the book is very much like an infomercial with very little on the actual application or foods of the diet until the last 100 pages or so.Alot of the information is more common sense than anything else: stay away from processed foods, sugar, junk food etc. Also the foods recommended and the places listed in the book to order the food from are rather expensive and the recipes are more time consuming than I would have hoped.If you can afford the diet, and have the time and energy to follow it you will be healthier for it. However, I don't see the need to purchase the book or other instructional products to do so."
3,The makers diet,"I would rate this 5 stars except for one simple fact. Reality. If you can afford to live this way I think you would be much better off. I am putting as much as I can afford into practice myself and feel that I am benifiting greatly for it. It's jut so darn expensive. I mean an extra 200-400 per month expensive. His next book should be about how to make it more afordable.Just a comment on the other reviews. When he talks about not exercising, I think what he is talking about is extreems i.e. marathon runners, boddy builders, professionel dancers, and no I don't mean strippers."
1,silly diet for tubby folks,"If readers would exercise for 40-days, they would CERTAINLY lose weight.Yet people want the lazy way out.For those who have fatten themselves up over 20 years, they certainly will not lose the weight in 40 days.Listen friend - the best 3 pieces of diet advice are:1. exercise2. exercise3. exercise"
1,"Quack, quack, quack!","If you are concerned about your health, this is not the book for you. If you are interested in one man's subjective opinion with weak religious references, by all means read away. Although Rubin intelligently touts the merits of high quality, organic food, he slips into a nutritional black hole when he deems hotdogs healthier than a banana. This book also appears to be his vehicle for marketing his own line of products, which turns his ""factual advice"" into a long-winding advertisement. I advise you as consumers to use common sense and choose wisely before blindly following a regimen lacking in concrete scientific support."
2,An Imperfect CD,"If you aren't a ""completist"" Tull fan (the kind that wants every Tull CD in his or her collection), I wouldn't recommend this one.Yes, 'Living In the Past' is one of my Jethro Tull favorites. 'Up The Pool' is obscure, yet excellent, Tull song. And 'Life's and Long Song' proves a previous reviewer's point that Tull is a great when unplugged.But, if the only Jethro Tull you have heard is what is on the radio, this CD isn't the best way to start learning more about the band's music. Instead, start with Songs From The Wood, A, Heavy Horses or Crest Of A Knave."
3,Stab in the Bach,"Jethro Tull's most revered collection is seriously compromised in this digital remix by the absence of ""Bouree"" and ""Teacher."" Arguably two of the band's most important works are shamelessly disgarded from this timeless collection due to ""time restrictions."" The main reason I bought this CD was to have a clean, digital rendition of Anderson's Classical/Jazz/Rock interpretation of Bach's masterpiece, ""Bouree."" No such luck. ""Bouree"" was very instrumental (exuse the pun) in my formative period as a vital link between popular and classical music. Without it I would have missed a masterful example of Anderson's origins and the importance of Bach's influence on modern music. Not a good recording for Tull purists who admire the original work and really value such a compelling connection to the past."
3,Half and album is better than none,"First of all, this is NOT a collection of older songs. That being said, as you can tell from the other reviews, this CD is a very mixed bag. If you like jazz piano and live jazz recordings, you will LOVE 'by kind permission of' which is a jazz version of beethoven's Pathetique sonata with some great jazz flute by Ian.As for the rest of the CD, some cuts are good, some are, well, lame. The title cut, which everyone has heard, was really Tull's first mainstream hit. To me, after this CD, their content became more commercial, more reaching for that next hit record. Maybe you like the later stuff better. I didnt. But the group did change. Get Aqualung first, and this one later."
3,Halfway House,"While I enjoy this CD, I have to say the reconfiguration done when converting it from LP to CD was a terrible hatchet job.When Tull was good they were--dare I say it?--magical. The first 11 tracks on this CD, along with ""Wond'ring Again"" and ""Hymn 43"" deliver that kind of magic. But the live tracks are ponderous, and I can't believe no one at Chrysalis considered dumping them to leave ""Teacher"" and the masterful ""Bouree"" on instead. If something needed to be cut to fit the LP on CD, it sure shouldn't have been Jethro Tulls best-ever recording.Still, this is a CD worth owning. Tull was unique, totally British and always more focused on making great music than many of their contemporaries."
5,tear erker,THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD BOOK.A CLASSIC AND SLAM BANG SAD STORY. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.WHAT A GREAT MOVIE THIS WOULD MAKE.
3,Breyer costs too much $$$,"This is a nice model. I saw it in the store. It was too expensive. Its a nice heavy model, and really accurate. But its not a toy."
2,Pencil arrived with broken point,"Pencil costs $5 and arrived loose in the box with the point broken off. I looked in the box and there wasnt even a broken lead point in there so it was placed in the box broken. For the money, i would expect it to be perfect. Its a good pencil but next time Ill go to a local store to buy one."
2,Mold growing,"These ducks look cute, but they float upside down. After having it for a month, there is mold growing inside the ducks. I have to throw them away."
3,Exaggeration of the truth--FIBBING,"Item states that it comes with gel fuel. Guess what? No gel fuel even though one pays for it. Best of all no credit either for item not included.Fondue pot itself is of good quality, cast iron visible along the rim unlike Creuset from old times that was totally ceramic glazed. All in all a well priced product."
3,"Funny, quirky and even a little sad.","Wish Craig were in this movie more. Of course, now that he's clean and sober, it's interesting to see how he might have been before when he was drinking."
3,Niagara Hotel,"I didn't expect the movie such a dark comedy. The cast was great but there wasn't enough of Craig Ferguson in it. I'm sure that I'll get more from it as I watch it again and again, though."
3,Niagra Motel,I love Craig Ferguson. This is the one and only reason that I bought this DVD. It is a collectors item as far as I am concerned.
3,It should have wowed me...,"Well the cast was good, the scenary lovely, but the story left me flat. Niagara Motel is the story of sevral couples around this run down hotel and the diner near by, it is intruging, but not really a must see. Of course it might just be me."
1,Received a PAL too,I also received a PAL version that I am unable to play. I'll be returning for one that I CAN enjoy!
4,A good debut,"This is a fine debut, but I'm looking forward to seeing what Chuck does in the coming years. The raw ability is definitely there, and the lyrics are very clever and original, but he still seems to be searching for his own musical voice. I hear it most strongly in songs like ""I Feel Ya, Harris-san"" and ""Gertrude Stein"", where he uses a sort of pop-classical piano style to tell stories about historial figures. Some of the other tracks remind me of Ben Folds, and some of Rufus. But I think the promise is there, and I for one am eager to see what he does next."
5,"please sir, can I have some more stars?","What an breathtaking cd. Brilliant, witty lyrics (how many artists can incorporate references to E.M. Forster novels and Gertrude Stein?); rich, affecting melodies; and truly incredible piano playing. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a cd on first listen. I'm so glad to have come across Chuck Coleman's music; he may not be well known now, but if there's any justice in the musical world, he'll be huge before long. I'll be buying a few more copies of this to pass on to friends, without a doubt. It's INCREDIBLE -- I'd give it 10 stars if I could."
5,A Great Find!!!,"I was browsing through the Jason Mraz and John Mayer cd's when I saw that a lot of people had recommended ""People, Places, and Flings"" by Chuck Coleman. I read a lot about him, but I wanted to hear what he sounded like. I went to his website (www.chuckcoleman.com) and listened to some clips of his songs. They are amazing. Also, if you buy the CD directly from his website, it only costs $10 and shipping is free. I don't mean to take buisness away from amazon, but you can't beat that price. All in all, this cd was a great find and is quite possibly the best cd I own. Another perk about buying from his website is that it comes in a hand adressed carton and has a letter inside signed by Chuck, who knows how much that'll be worth when he becomes famous. GO AND BUY THIS CD!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
5,"Smart, sensitive, soulful--and just plain FUN","This is a fantastic album. As a singer, Coleman has an amazing voice, marked by tremendous clarity, vulnerability, and intelligence. As a songwriter, Coleman has a gift for writing smart, witty lyrics and delightful, catchy choruses. I started to write down my favorite tracks, but I found myself writing down everything, so I had to raise the bar and restrict myself to my ""favorite favorite"" tracks: Brian Played Guitar, Me and Gertrude Stein, Daisy, Omar, and I Feel Ya, Harris-san. I recommend this CD most enthusiastically!"
2,Can't reccomend it,"I bought this CD eagerly anticipating some great new music. I should have read the reviews with a more cynical eye. Perhaps some are legitimate fans, but I have my doubts. I found this CD to be droll and tedious to listen too and I can't imagine anyone finding something to rave about. Not that every song is a complete loss, but as a whole the CD is not worth owning."
2,A bit of a disapointment,"I decided to take a chance on this CD, and while some of the tracks show promise (""Omar"" isn't bad), overall the CD was a bit of let down. It's one of those CDs that will go in the drawer, but I doubt it will ever come back out. That's the way it is for me anyhow."
2,Lacks something,"I've listened to it several times and it just isn't catching with me. Perhaps other people hear something I don't, but the CD doesn't quite live up to my expectations."
3,It's okay,The two best songs are the two MP3s. Listen to them and if you like them enough you should buy the cd. If you don't like them this CD probably isn't for you.
4,Very interesting version of a missing part of Oedipus story,"Even thoug the translating in Portuguese wasn`t okay, the novel Oedipus on the road has many qualities, like the deep questions in which it goes. Bauchau deals very well with the psychological aspects of characters well known like Oedipus and Antigone, and manage to create other ones like Clio, a very strong hero."
4,Toddler loves it!,"My 4 year old loves this tractor, he plays with it daily. Did break part of the bucket the first day of use, but he plays hard. Would recommend this product for the true tractor loving kid."
1,Quest Game For Babies,"It takes two hits to kill every enemy, except bosses. The undead bosses take one hit -- one cureall spell. If your age is in the double digits in years, this game will probably be too simple for you. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,I turned it off once I found out you can jump...,This really isn't a part of the Final Fantasy series. It's just labeled as such so it would sell better here in the US. And yes... you can really jump in this game...
4,Great entry-level RPG,"This is the first RPG that I had ever played. In that way, it was a great introduction, although it doesn't hold up so well now that I've played other games in the Final Fantasy series. This game is very simple, as it was meant to be an introductory-type of game. If you like retro-gaming though, this is worth a look. I thought it was worth my time, and I still play it every once and a while all these years later."
3,It's like Final Fantasy for Kids,"I played this when I was 12 and loved it; in fact, I once played this for 5 hours straight and didn't know it. But when I played it again as an adult, it was way too easy. So if you're a kid and you need to learn more about RPG's(and you actually still have a SNES), you might like to play this one. Otherwise, move onto a numbered FF game like Final Fantasy 6 or 9.I will say the music isn't half bad though :)"
3,Final Fantasy for Dummies,"That should be the real title....I played this game about 10 years ago...I liked it then, but I havent played it since I finished it 10 years ago. there is no real story, the charachters are lifeless and boring, and the graphics were not too hot. I dont remember muich about the plot though, so I cant really talk about it...I just know it's basicly a dummied down FF game.skip this one and get the astonishingly great game Final Fantasy 3"
3,Simply square,"This game, beleive it or not is probably the greatest example ever of Nintendo's and Square's contempt of the European games player.You see, whilst Japanese gamers in the mid 90's were getting their teeth into Final Fantasies 4 to 6 and the Dragonquest Series, and gamers in the States had final Fantasy 4 and 6 to enjoy, we in the UK got mystic quest.Described on the box as an entry level rpg it was just that - you didn't actually have to think about it so much as have the patience to sit through it - no puzzles to solve outside of 'find a switch', not even square's famous random encounters, the baddies just sat there but unfortunately you couldn't generally walk round them. The square battle engine and menus were there, but none of the compelling gameplay that made FF 6 and Chrono Trigger such classics.I suppose we should be grateful they gave us Secret of Mana...."
4,Not bad for a beginner's game.,"Come on people. Let's stop slamming this game and take it for what it is. It's a simple, basic game designed for little children or others who are completely new to RPGs. This isn't meant for people who've been raised on FF6, 7 and 8.Now, when you take it for what it is, it's actually pretty cool. 10 mandatory battles before proceeding is really not that bad compared to random battles--at least this way you can do your fighting and get it over with instead of getting attacked every 2 steps like in FF7 or 8.Also, this game has the absolute BEST battle music I've ever heard in a Final Fantasy game.Now, the graphics are simple, the music is simple, the story is very simple... everything about this game is simple. It's like the Sesame Street of RPGs, and that's exactly what it was designed for. If you just take it for what it is, it's not that bad at all."
5,Underrated,"As one of the first Final Fantasy games I ever played (of course I was only 11 when it came out) it holds a special place in my heart. Sure, this isn't a game that will take 80+ hours to complete or pages upon pages of printed walkthroughs - but that's what makes it so enjoyable. Yes, it's a game for beginners, but even 16 years later I still find it to be a great game - with decent graphics, great storyline, entertaining characters and wonderful music - one that I still enjoy playing.Now if only they would release it for download on the WII..."
2,The worst FF,"This is a good intro to RPGs but I would say if you are over 10 you will not find this game fun at all, try all the others on Super NES and PS and PS2 but this one. First of all it has a really bad setup for battles it has a very easy but boring battling system and gets to where you don't want to play it. I would not recommend this game."
2,"I've played worse. Not FF material, but good for kids.","Though any SNES game bearing the title ""Final Fantasy"" can now be called a collector's item, this is definitely the least sought after of the bunch. This is a hard game to appreciate having experienced parts 4 and 6, but for younger gamers, this is the perfect game. The story is strictly storybook-standard fodder, non-violent and pleasing to simple minds. The graphics and music are not even worth mentioning, as they cannot rightfully be called Final Fantasy material.But considering the target market, it would be unfair to totally trash this game. If I had a son, I would get this game for him as an into into RPGs. The better installments could wait. I wouldn't call this game the ""Worst RPG Of All Time"", since I have played much, much worse."
4,FINAL FANTASY MYSTIC QUEST REVIEW,Personally I found this game fun and I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THESE OTHER REVIEWERS CAN CRITICIZE IT! This game was my first experience with the series and I had a lot fun with it. Who cares what the story is I DON'T KNOW AND DEFINITELY DON'T CARE BEYOND ALL BELIEF! The graphics may be bad but WHO CARES?!! Now I do wish to play Final Fantasy II & III but this Final Fantasy game gave me a spectacular look at this amazing series.
4,how could you say this isnt a final fansty game?,this game is quite fun relly yeah u can jump but still i think you can jump and ff x-2 too. anyway this game is a little hard in the puzzles and the battles are very slow with little animation also you can only have one other person in you party but if you like older games or a little less of a chalenge this is the game for you hope this review helps.
2,Who's fantasy is this?,"This game is the worst final fantasy game I've ever had the misfortune to play. The bad graphics are only masked by the horrific gameplay & loss of convincing Heros, not to mention the absence of convincing story-lines that made the Final Fantasy series such a huge hit! The only fantasy that comes to mind when playing this game is the fantasy of killing yourself or throwing it out the window and praying to God for the souls of the people who put this game on the market. I warn all new-comers to the final fantasy world: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! If your looking for a good final fantasy game to start up with I recomend Final Fantasy I & II Dawn of Souls for the GameBoy Advance, or Final Fantasy Origins for the PSone.Written by:ShadowMage (The game maniac)"
1,Too Easy,"Lets face it, this game shouldn't even be called Final Fantasy because of the crummy map. It's not even challenging! You will get SO BORED after killing the same enemies over and over in a one hit K.O all the time. It's plot is the worst of them all. This is the worst game to ever hit the FF series."
3,Great condition,Although this was the fastest shipping the book was in great condition and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future. Great buy!
4,"Finally, a clock radio with everything.","The best feature of this audio system is the ability to attach an external antennae for the radio. I like waking up to public radio not music in the morning, and I've been hard pressed to find a CD player/radio system that plays both well until now. My only complaint is the mood light that changes colors or not on the LCD display that is too bright at night, and hard to read unless uou're close up. It's a nice compact system for a bedroom that fits on a night stand, or can be wall mounted. The speakers can be detached from the main unit and wall mounted as well. The remote is the size of a credit card. It has some good features like 20 memory presets, and displays temperature, date, as well as time. Oh yes, and the sound is quite good. Much better than my old boom box. An amazing value."
2,"Tiresome, tiresome, tiresome . . .","Though I was intrigued by the novel after reading Eco's The Name of the Rose, I found the book unbearably dull. It took me about six months to finish it, just because I kept picking up other more interesting books to read. I eventually suffered through it. I have seen this book numerous times on bargains shelves in various stores, and I always have to fight the urge to complain to management about having the nerve to sell such a laborious read.The Name of the Rose receives high marks from me. Baudolino -- not so much."
1,"the most annoying book, ugh","I tried to read this book. I really tried. I got it on sale because I'd heard of the author and was curious. This is the first book in my memory that I have put aside because I hated every sentence in it. Normally I struggle through the first part of a ""boring"" book and become pleasantly surprised by the end. I just couldn't get past the first fifty pages, and not without lack of effort. The sad part is that I wanted to like this book and made an honest effort to, but the author made that impossible for me. My advice is don't read this one - there are better books out there. Who knows, in a few years I may even be willing to try one of Eco's earlier works. Then again, I hate this book so much that I doubt I'll even be willing to concede to that. If you like ""historical"" fiction, try Carter Beats the Devil or the Venus Throw, which are a lot more fun to read."
4,Great Shoe but tight fit,These are a great value for what you get compared to some of the more expensive ones. I wear an 8 though and should have got one size up cause my feet are a little squished!
5,Great Boots!,I made sure I tried on a simular boot before I bought these to get my size. I would suggest doing that. The boots I tried on were $99.95. This boot is identical for a lot less. They are warm & feel very good. I LOVE the savings. I got them in a timely fashion & I am really glad I ordered them because they are not available now.
4,A bit snug,"I'm in the UK and a size 5, so I ordered these in a US 7 as per the Amazon size chart but they're a bit tight and uncomfortable. I think the 8 would've been too big though so I'm hoping they'll stretch. FYI the size chart is inaccurate as it says a Eur 38 is a UK 6 (it's a 5). The colour from the retailer's photo of this boot is much darker than 'sand' which is a very pale cream IRL."
4,Run Big,"These are sturdy, well-made boots, especially with the removable insole. Not bad for the price. However, they run big, so get one size smaller."
1,OUCH!,If you will be doing any amount of walking you want to stay away from these boots.Not only are they not flexible but they also lack support so your entire legs end up hurting.
3,boots,The boots were poor quality. I was confused when I purchased the item. I did not realize that the product was from England until the total purchase price was given. It did not say where the item came from and I did not understand the sign that made it pounds. It was a huge mistake that could have been prevented if the place the item is from would be shown clearly. I have returned the items. I will let you know how well this part is handled.
1,Way too wide and big.,My size is usually 6.5. I sized up to 7. But they are way too large. The shoes are warm indeed. But it is pretty hard to walk in them. It feels like wearing slippers. But they are indeed cheap if you want something warm.
3,TO SMALL,THE BOOTS R GOOD LOOKING AND A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS ORDER A SIZE BIGGER THEY R TO SMALL.
4,Very warm!,"These boots are nice and toasty, keep my feet warm in the cold Colorado winter! It's nice to have boots I can just slip on real quick before going outside. They fit pretty true to size, although my toes are at the edge, so I'm hoping they'll stretch a little. Otherwise I'm very happy and these are a great deal!"
5,A fun read,Big House was a great coach - the fifth best in history of college basketball but more importantly he was a guy with a sense of values and a good sense of humor. He knows basketball as well as anyone in the country and has some candid comments about how to improve the game. But his real commitment was to the students he coached. He experienced the bitter bite of segregation - working for an HBCU called Winston Salem State - but his memoir is better than a rant - it is a reflection of his insight and integrity.
1,Almost as bad as the first Home Alone,"this game is horrible. not only is it really hard, but the game is boring. wish they could have spiced it up a bit. avoid. 1 star."
4,Odd film.,"I'm one of those goofballs that has a ridiculous amount of B-movie DVDs for no apparent reason. I'm just constantly buying random films that nobody has ever heard of. There is something about a film that tries hard to be good but falls flat on its face. However, I'm not quite sure that is what happened with this film. I actually have no idea what they were going for with this one. If you are a B-movie collector, buy it because you certainly don't own anything like this one."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The quality is mediocre at best. They are light weight, but not very comfortable due to the loose fit of the earpiecs. Stereo sound is not great either. The mic is not adequate for voice recognition software."
2,Cool movie lousy budget...,"This is a very independent but poorly made movie... It lacks cast, crew and editing process. But its a nice attempt for a DIY punk rock film. If you like No Use For A Name and C}california punk rock bands, go for it!..."
3,bowl brush or an excellent duster,"This was such a reasonably-priced product, I thought I could use it once or twice and toss it away. however, the new price is ridiculously, high, i paid 1.99.don't buy at this price."
3,PARTS HARD TO FIND,"The RIDGID MS12502 12"" miter saw is a great tool and works as advertised however they have discontinued a part that is very easy broken and that is the throat plate p/n 826886. The saw is worthless without it. Anyone have a lead on where to obtain?"
1,Bad luck I guess,"Purchased this adapter in an attempt to connect my new HTPC to my receiver. I was a little disconcerted by the bit of clear plastic that extends from the end of the plug when the TOSLINK cable is inserted into the adapter (not to be confused with the protective plastic covering). It protrudes maybe an 1/8 of an inch and seems very fragile. I can't really tell if it is supposed to be there from the pictures provided by Amazon. Anyway, the adapter w/o the cable fit easily into my HTPC's optical out but required more force than I'm comfortable with when the TOSLINK cable was attached. After configuring the digital out, I didn't get any sound. Tried with my MacBook Pro and no sound. Interestingly, the bit of plastic and the small metal coupler can be removed--but this configuration didn't work either. Hopefully I haven't damaged my audio ports with that additional bit of plastic."
1,"Does the job, but is way too tight","My reason for getting this adapter was so that I could use my one optical cable with either the XBox or my Mac by swapping out the adapter.The problem is that this adapter fits way too snuggly. I can't get it off without fear that I'll break the cable its attached to.So my purpose was to avoid buying another cable, but I had to buy another cable anyway because I can't get the adapter off of my existing cable.It does have great sound quality, although how could any optical device or adapter not have good sound quality? It either works or it doesn't."
2,Not a standard size,"I bought this adapter thinking it was a good rated product that would work well with my MacBook Pro!!! to my surprise, this turned out to be a poor quality jack that is not to the standard 3.5 measurement. it does not work unless you push the jack firmly with your hand and place a little wight on top to keep it in place. this is completely unacceptable. i tried to shave off a little from the head of the adapter to allow for one more millimeter of length but in vain there is no click that you get from the regular headphones jack."
4,Unknown Picture Details,"Great Tips for the Money, But a Little Misled by the Picture Which Shows Two Tips and Only Get One."
3,Fragile but essential for the true audiophile,"This is a good product. I ended up ordering two to hook up my macbook pro into my apple Hi Fi stereo and it worked great until the tip of one of the fiber optic cable adapters broke off. They are fragile, so use caution when handling this item, but otherwise it produces excellent sound quality when used in appropriate applications."
1,"Too Small for Jack, Does Not Work","The title pretty much says it all folks. This adapter is too small for my laptop's 3.5 mm jack, I had to keep it held into the jack for audio to work, otherwise as soon as I let go audio stopped. Did not work on my Macbook Pro. Picked up another brand, works great now."
2,for what you pay shipping could be better,basically the thing almost popped out of the envelope it was shipped in; for the price of shipping and handling (try ordering more than one and you'll see what i mean) the least they could do is use sufficient padding to prevent the adaptor from tearing through the envelope during shipping. luckily it was still in there.
5,Got the job done,"Its the connector I needed, it works fine, no problems. Basically it does what it is suppose to do."
3,Didn't Fit my intel iMac,"i had another adapter that worked flawlessly, but when it broke i bought this one. Although it looked the same size it was slightly too big for the audio jack on the back of my Intel iMac. I'm sure it works great, but it didn't work for me."
4,Different fit on different cables - it works on the thinner cable,I have two Toslink cables. One cable is thinner than the other and has smaller-diameter jacks. This adapter fits easily onto the smaller cable and works fine. It was a struggle to get it on and off the larger cable.
4,Godsend for macs,Not sure how many people know that many macs have a dual with optical output. It is not that obvious though harder core games or macaddicts know. This particular product is an inexpensive yet highly effective way to unleash the beast of Dolby Digital. Warning is that not everything is encoded in DD but those items accessible are amazing.
3,Works with some Toslink cables better than others.,"I purchased this adapter for digital sound from my Mac Mini. This adapter did work; however, it isn't perfect. First, the 1/8"" connector does not fit as snugly into the port as I had hoped. It still stays in though. Also be aware that the connection between the adapter and the standard size Toslink (optical) cable varies. When I first used a Belkin brand cable,Belkin Av20000B03 PureAV Digital Optical Audio Cable - 3 Ft., into it, the connection was very loose with no satisfying ""click."" However, a cheaper cable I had,Toslink Digital Optical Audio Cable 6 ft., works great. Just be aware that this adapter is not great for all cables. All in all, the adapter gets the job done."
1,Buy a Cable Instead,"The fit onto my optical cable was so tight that it was impossible to get it on all the way.In the end, I jammed the adapter onto the cable, and the notches on the cable's end still did not reach into the slots on the adapter.And while light shone through in a manual test, the cable did not work with my Creative X-Fi card. I suspect the adapter did not fully reach the transceiver inside the jack.Then I had to chew away at the adapter because it was now impossible to remove. When I finally got it off, my original cable was damaged from all the force.This cost me half an hour, 2 bucks, and an optical cable.Just buy an optical cable with one end standard, one end pointlessly miniature."
2,"Works, but not well with the Belkin Pure AV toslink cable","I have the Belkin PureAV Digital Optical Audio Cable and although this works, and transmits audio, the cable does NOT stay in the connector at all. My Toslink cable doesn't insert all the way into this connector so it falls out ALL THE TIMEhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VWIR6/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details"
5,Exactly what I'd hoped for. Arrived on time.,This movie is exactly what I hoped for. It arrived on time and my daughter loves it! I would recommend buying this movie and the seller!
4,A quick review,"Excellent animation, beautiful colours. The story-line is fine, though a little more film on the cutting floor would've helped at times.Overall, though, it's a gas!"
5,Cars,I bought this for my grandchildren but found it quite interesting myself. I especially liked the documentary containing information about the people behind the voices. Amazon's service was excellent.
3,"Admired it, but couldn't love it","An arrogant young race car (Owen Wilson) has his eyes opened to what really matters in life when he finds himself stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten little town on Route 66 where folks still care about each other.There is a lot to enjoy in this movie. The animation is spectacular, the voice talent is top-notch, and it presents good lessons about respect for the simple, enduring pleasures of life and the false allure of fame. Despite these strengths and some good laughs, I didn't connect with this film on an emotional level. I think I just wasn't captivated by the concept of characters developed from cars, but my two-year-old son certainly was, and his opinion probably counts more than mine."
3,Not Up to par,"As is usual with a Pixar film, Cars has excellent visuals, and they really shine in the Blu-Ray version of the film. The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults. I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E. If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray. If you're looking to build a complete collection of Pixar on Blu-Ray, it's worth the money."
5,"Awesome movie, even for adults!","Just watched this film, and loved it! Another hit from Pixar! Beautiful PQ from beginning to end, and the storyline is touching throughtout. Even as a an adult with no kids, I thoroughly enjoyed this film-a great blend of humor, humanity, romance, and a fitting use of lyrics."
1,Failure...,"I'm afraid to say that I simply hated this movie. It was boring, slow, and the story sucks. Pixar has really been failing recently, including Finding Nemo, Incredibles, and then this. If anybody wants to see a good animated movie, go see Over The Hedge. I give that 5 stars, as it is the best animated movie I've ever seen."
2,Marketing NASCAR to children,"The car race industry is very good at cultivating new customers at an early age. I wonder if the producers of ""Cars"" received some money from the business.Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids. How much of a movie like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy?I thought ""Finding Nemo"" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters).I gave ""Cars"" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it.For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend ""Mothering"" magazine. They review all sorts of good movies, CDs and books to entertain and educate young people."
2,Stupid unlikly the best movie of the year...,"** 1/2 Cars looks stupid and crazy unlike any Pixair movies.Once agian the water cycle is idotic and more crazy than Chicken Little.Talking cars, a stupid race.....I don't think so....I don't think so.....<grin>Although I put **2 1/2 stars because the animation is WONDERFUL.I like the widscreen previews but it's sooooooooooooooo0 stupid that's why I put the half.That's all I can say.STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. and don't forget....STUPID."
3,No Frills to Go with the Thrills,"The movie was beautifully done. BUT I have come to look forward to the commentary track and behind the scenes creative madness.In this version, you just get the movie and 2 shorts.Hopefully Pixar will release a 2 disk version in the near future -- wait for it for the full Pixar magic."
4,"Not prime Pixar, but close","It's a little thin on story, but the characters are so charming and the visuals so dazzling that it's hard to knock this movie. PLUS ... it holds my nephew's attention every time we watch it together, and that's saying something. Now if only I could stop him from saying the lines out loud; he's memorized the whole thing.I grew up in an era in which cartoons were pure fun ... Looney Tunes stuff, that kind of thing. Lots of modern animation doesn't grab me. This film did."
3,It's a boy's world (mainly) film,"The film itself is great. My son was a little frightend at the beginning because the motor noise was so loud. This actual ""being there"" grandstand sound only works when you've been there. We have'nt. The story is good, the graphics are great. A girl race driver could have made the film appeal to more girls. Would still recommend the film to others."
5,I don't even like racing & I love this movie.,"I don't even like racing & I love this movie. I have seen it twice now & I loved it more the second time around. I watched it with my 15 month old grandson this time & he was ""hooked""! Go Mater!"
5,Cars Gift Set,I looked everywhere for this movie. My grandson loves CARS and wanted it for his birthday. He was so happy when he opened his gift!
2,Cars Review,"This is a very long one note joke. Lighting Mcqueen is not that interesting. Most of the cast are stereotypes. The moral is phoned in right from the start. Worst of all,the story itself is very predictable. Surf's Up would do a similar story the very next year after this was made. The A+ moments are the first-rate animation,the amazing race scenes and the crash scenes. I'll give them that. I give this film a 3 out of 10."
5,Best CARS DVD ever!,My grandson loves this movie so therefore I am buying him another DVD for when the one he has wears out from him watching it so often.
3,Great kids movie,"My kids love the movie & I even enjoy watching it too! Don't like that there is a bit of lying which is easily overlooked but that can get instilled in our kids, kids pick up the slightest details. So I address the lying each time it comes up in the video."
2,DUD,DUD- Our family loves PIXAR movies. We watch them often. But no one ever picks this one. The grandchildren who will watch movies over and over never made it to the end of this one. So thank you PIXAR for all the joyful fun and love you have given to the world before this.
3,Three stars for the animation and Larry the Cable Guy...other than that your SOL...,"Sure `Cars' is beautifully animated but it lacks so much to me, especially with all of the hype and praise this film has garnered. It just didn't make me laugh. Sure, there are some funny lines littered throughout the film, but as far as consistent humor it was sorely lacking. The story from the beginning didn't really grab me, but with the right touch it could have eventually. Larry the Cable Guy was by far the best thing to happen to this cartoon, but even he couldn't make me love it. I will never be caught saying I wasn't impressed by it's beauty, I mean, I may not like the movie but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't impressed in some ways, but I may also never be caught watching this movie again since aside from the animation there was nothing much to hold my attention."
2,Cars Used DVD,"The DVD was scratched and skips a lot - almost to the point where we can't use it. However, my son is only 22 months old, so he doesn't care if we just skip over it. I was disappointed that it was labeled 'Excellent Condition' - when clearly it wasn't"
5,Cars,"I loved this movie, the best Pixar feature so far, as an old car buff I really related to the cars, in fact I owned a WW2 Jeep and a fiat bambino. Very funny dialogue and great story line, pity Steve McQueen isn't still alive to voice Lightning McQueen."
4,Cars Review,"Very cute movie. I think ""Finding Nemo"" was WAY better, but Cars is cute in it's own way. I like the way Pixer chooses such different concepts for each movie. Very creative."
4,Great movie for little kids,"Little kids will love this movie, besides the whole car vroom, vroom thing, it's got some great imagery. It does have a predictable story line however it has no scary scenes to frighten smaller children. The sound track is fun with up-to-date music and voices. Pixar created some fantasic scenery incorporating car parts into the land and cliffs."
5,What's not to love?,"A very ""G"" rated movie, super fast cars, great story line and a happy ending. Seriously, I love this movie. Wait, I mean, my three year old loves this movie.... =)"
4,happy,"The disc work greats and my son has enjoyed this movie countless times. I was disappointed that the case arrived broken, but that was an easy fix!"
3,Decent movie,"My son loves it. It has some tender moments, and is vastly better than the horrible Cars 2. However, too often cartoons that are out for a few years get hailed as ""classics"" when they are far from even very good. Pixar has made one great movie: Wall-E. They made several that are competent. But most of their kids' stories lack heart. Plenty of children's movies over the years have been made with soul - this one has sentimentality. Oh, and cool cars!"
3,It's okay,"I love this movie, however this copy doesn't have a ""scene"" selection option...which is a little annoying. It wasn't a horrible price, but for a few dollars more, you can get one with a scene selection."
5,Excellent on Blu-Ray!,"If this movie goes down in price, definitely get it on Blu-Ray. On a regular DVD you'll probably just see better detail and brighter colors. But on the Blu-Ray version I could make out textures on surfaces of the people/surroundings that I never saw before."
5,An Instant Classic!,"I would rate this along the lines of ""Toy Story"" as far as a child's ability to relate and enjoy the film, and for staying power.My 3 year old son is addicted to this movie. The ""speed"" and ""lightening"" and even the classic music used in the film (Route 66 and the first song I heard right after getting my driver's license at 16 - Life is a Highway) make the perfect blend for a life-long HIT!The actual story is original - tying racing with the story of Route 66. The characters are likable and entertaining for ALL ages!Whether you are 3 or 103, I think you will enjoy the originality, comedy, music, action and even a little bit of romance! Two thumbs up and a must- have for all animation film collectors!"
5,Awesome Disney - Finally,"This is a heart-warming story that the children, and grown-ups, in our family enjoy.....the cousins, the grandparents, aunts and uncles - all of us. Phooey to those who critisize about 'talking' cars not making realistic characters - children have great imaginations and can easily see Lightning, Mater, Sally and the gang as 'real.' Adults who can't need to expand their inner-child and remember what it is like to have an imagination. This movie is a great place to start!"
4,Cars,"Cars is a really fun movie with a great message. It is, however, (or it seems to me), primarily a ""kid's flick"". There is some adult humor, the animation is wonderful, the colors are bright and the ""voices"" fit their characters very well. Children will want to watch it over and over, I think, but for me once was enough."
2,Silly and boring,"I purchased this DVD for my husband who is a nascar fan. When it arrived I sat down to view it with him. I only watched it for a short time before I was completely bored. My husband said it got better but I wasn't there to verify that, so maybe it does."
5,My son loves it,My son watches it almost everyday. So it totally is worth the money I spent. I think it is good for a 3-4 year old boy.
4,nice movie and disc is good,"I've started using this and results are very good, I mean picture quality and sound"
4,"*********** Cars, a cute auto movie******************","I loved this movie when it came out. Had purchased a copy when it went on DVD, watched it many times, with the family, until it started to freeze up too many times. Now on blue ray, not only still a cute movie, awesome graphics."
5,"Great quality product, Great quality movie","This movie is first-rate entertainment for kids--and adults, too! At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk ""kid"" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old ""man"" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended."
4,Cool Movie,"I just bought a PlayStation 3 which has a built in bluray player, so I decided to get some bluray movies and this was one of them. I'd never seen it before.The movie was pretty good. I liked the story line even though it's a pretty repeated theme. The effects were pretty good. The voices in the movie were excellent (even Owen Wilson...whom I don't normally like).The bluray was pretty cool but I was getting the feeling like it was almost too pristine. When I watch a movie, I expect some cracks and pops from the film (I don't like that but) and this one was perfect. The cars all looked nice and shiny and the scenery was perfect. But almost too perfect.Good movie though."
5,"Cute, Funny, Heartwarming","I really enjoyed this movie, it was heartwarming. I even cried (yeah I know I'm weak) but its very good! I love how everybody in the little town has their own little shop and their personality but they all get along. Okay well heres my summary:Lightening McQueen is a rookie and doing great, him and 3 other cars tie a race. So as a tie breaker they have another race in I think California. So as Mac (McQueen's truck) is driving him to the race he falls asleep and McQueen goes out. He ends up by himself and drives and he ends up in Radiator Springs where he makes friends and learns a huge secret! And then watch the ending for yourself, I recommend it and trust me I'm alittle older so all age levels will love this movie!"
4,An enjoyable but not great film,"I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released.Not up to normal/past Pixar standards.I say it is most like A Bugs Life. A good but not great film.Music did nothing for me. Where was the normal stand out musical score?Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section. I would have liked to have seen that.SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES. THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS. YUCK!!!!!!Kids will enjoy. Nascar fans will enjoy.Fun but forgettable after you watch it."
4,Lovely but...,"It lacked that deep emotional connection other Pixar films had. Still, it has great animation a wonderful voices and characters, but is not Toy Story, certainly not The Incredibles or Finding Nemo."
3,Great Movie....horrible DVD.,"Maybe it's me. I bought this DVD, enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions, and I am less than happy. All other previous Disney/Pixar movies filled up the screen on my set....this one gives me black bars. I also have to go into the audio set up menu every time to select the Dolby Digital 5.1 option....I didn't have to do that on their other movies. The movie is great, but the execution/delivery of the DVD is sub-par at best."
2,Ok film.. Less than OK DVD..,"First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself."
3,Movie great - toy cars are sort of cheap,Of course the movie is wonderful. The Blu-Ray is outstanding and it comes with a DVD version.I bought the gift set because it was an inexpensive way to get the Blu-Ray (it was priced well below the Blu-Ray price during a Christmas sale). The toy cars are of a sub-standard quality and not worth paying extra. I would not recommend buying this unless it was less expensive than just the Blu-Ray disc.
5,Cars,"This was a Christmas gift for my grandson, he watches this movie over and over, takes his tractors and tips them over like when Mater and Lightening McQueen make them do in the movie, so that will show you how much kids like this movie. It's a Classic movie and a great one for kids. Was a great price also, as it's mostly only found on blue-ray that's way to expensive."
5,Cars Blu-ray movie,The product was very neatly packaged and was delivered in a few days. I was very pleased.
5,High Definition Perfection,"This is a must buy for anyone with a Blu-Ray player. Great flick, but add in amazing picture quality and fantastic surround sound. The features are really cool to play around with. Great for all ages."
5,Cars DVD review,"Loved it! The animation was almost ""live"" quality, and the story was great. The actors were perfect for their parts. Paul Newman was actually a serious racer at one time. George Carlin as a hippie VW Micro bus. (Gonna miss those two), and the real story of the Hudson Hornet. Lots of fact woven into the story."
4,great kid video,"This is a good movie for children and adults. Interesting storyline, bright colorful characters and graphics. Enjoy with your children or grandchildren."
5,Pixar is AWESOME,"As with all things Pixar, this is a great movie. Probably not my favorite of the bunch, but still a very great flick for kids and adults. If it's Pixar, it's going to be a winner."
5,Terrific,I bought this for my 3-year old son's Christmas present. We ended watching it FOUR times on Christmas Day!!! Three months later .. it's STILL his number 1 DVD. This is the best buy I've made in a long time!! I highly recommend it!
5,Cars,"Great movie, great sound track. Both my 4 year old girl and my 10 year old boy love this movie. Its hard to find something that they bolth agree on. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is awsome!! Great story line with good lessons to learn."
5,saw this at the movie theater,"i'm a grown adult but i have to say i really liked this film. it was nice, taught a story about sacrifice, and a little appreciation of route 66. i actually went on it two months ago and what a gorgeous view. we often forget what we have in this country, this dvd brings it in a cartoonish way."
3,Good means skipping,The condition of the video did say good. So I guess good means it will skip and stop and such. bummer!
3,Cars,"I bought this movie because it has cars in it. I would recommend for older children. My son is 18 months and it does not hold his attention. I gave it three stars not because it is not good, but because it is not good for my sons age. Other wise a five star movie"
4,Pixar is King,"Even if you aren't a NASCAR fan or fan of cars in general, this movie will entertain. Decent story, endearing characters and enough innuendo humor to keep adults laughing too. Pixar is King. I don't think they can do wrong."
5,Great Kids Movie,I bought this movie for my granddaugther and she absolutely loves it (she's 2 1/2).
5,Nephew loves it.,"What child has not seen ""Cars""? Now they can have it at their fingertips and with supervision pop it in when they want it. They don't seem to tire of it."
3,Not my favorite Pixar,"I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie, but I'm not one of them. It is for sure more entertaining than the average kids movie. I just can't get into it for some reason. If you are looking for a good Disney/Pixar movie I would recommend UP or WALL-E. If you want to make sure it appeals to kids, go for Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, any of the Toy Storys or Monsters Inc"
4,Amazon Verified Purchase,My 7 year old granddaughter enjoys watching Cars 1 with her Mom; I'm glad I could find this 2006 DVD to go with her Cars 2 DVD she got for Christmas. Love Pixar movies! Great buying experience from Amazon approved Seller.
5,Grandson loves this,"Received this a few days before Christmas, made a good present for my little guy. All my grandchildren have watched this a half dozen times.. No probems - Excellent"
5,One of the best Blu-ray out there,The image and sound are so great that you can feeel the images coming out your HDTV...
4,Review of Cars (Blu-ray),One of the best animated movies to watch on your blu-ray system. The detail on the screen are incredible. The sound is thrilling.
5,This is a wonder...,"This is a heartwarming story that kids and parents will both adore...I have three boys ages 1 1/2, 4 and 6...This movie has been a favorite for two years now! Great soundtrack, and a great storyline...This deserved the Oscar!"
5,Classic,"Some movies, or cartoons end up being classics, I think this is going to be one of those. I've watched this thing about 6 times already, always see something new in the background. A must have."
5,Cars,I'm very impressed by this company. I recieved my DVD in 3 days and in perfect condition as promised. I will definetly order from them again.
5,CARS,My grandson and the rest of the family found ourselves not being able to pull ourselves away from watching this movie over and over.Great buy and fast shipping.
5,Typical Pixar--heartwarming and wonderful!,"I don't think Pixar has gone wrong yet, and that is certainly true with ""Cars."" Lightning McQueen is on the fast-track to being a big star (literally, he's a race car). However, after finding himself stranded in run-down little Radiator Springs--a once-prosperous old Route 66 town that fell off the map when the Interstate bypassed it--he realizes the importance of slowing down, and how much it matters to care for others."
4,very good service,I am very satisfied both by the product that I got & also the speed of delivering this.
5,"Not a NASCAR Fan - Loved ""Cars"" Anyway","""Cars"" is a great flm, even for those of us not into auto racing. I have watched it twice in the last month and still want to see it again. And I'm a senior citizen with no kids!"
4,Cars! A really cute movie for the whole family.,This was a really great movie the whole family could watch! So refreshing for a change.
4,Not much of a fan of Nascar but....,Did enjoy this movie. Purchased it for my son's Christmas gift. I know he will enjoy it as much as we all did watching it at Grammies. :o)
5,Great movie,"My wife and I purchased this movie so we would know what the heck the grandkids were talking about. However, the movie contains a couple of good life lessons (real important stuff) and as a car guy I really appreciated the car detail. I would recommend this movie, loads of harmless fun."
2,Not very entertaining. Wayyy too long.,"I've enjoyed every Pixar movie I've seen......except this one. It was not entertaining, and was almost never funny. The movie is 2 hours long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over after the first hour. My wife and I had to turn it off at the 1.5 hour mark. Overall, it doesn't seem good for either adults (because of the above mentioned) or for kids (because of the length). Pixar has so many other movies. See those"
3,Not exactly the 'G' rating we were hoping for....,"We haven't exposed our 2 1/2 year old to too many movies, but thought Cars would be a good one due to its rating and ""topic."". We were pretty disappointed. We didn't expect a 'G' rated movie to have the language and attitudes that were presented in the movie. When I say language, I mean words that he doesn't need to be using at 2.5 years....idiot, moron, stupid,etc. We are fairly certain that at his young age, these words probably did not resonate with him, but that doesn't make it okay for a 'G' rated movie to have that in it. As far as the car part of the movie, he loved it."
3,Cars,I thought this movie sucked and was boring! I took my nephew and niece to the show to see it when it first came out and found myself in the hallway just to get away from this awful movie. But my 4yr old son likes this movie! I enjoy many of the movies I buy him and find it great when we can watch a movie together (he always wants the company). Guess you can’t win them all.
4,Not just for the CG and the excitement - cool outlook and warm within,"Neither a car nor a sports fan, I can still experience the excitement and fuss over the race as depicted in the first 15 minutes of the film. The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling."
1,Vile Cacophany,We watched the first ten minutes of this cacophonous drivel and then switched it off. Our daughter didn't even object. Compared with the ingenuity of Aardman's Pirates and Arthur Christmas Disney and Pixar are starting to slouch. Shamefully bad.
2,Fun Filled Film,"Cars is a fun filled film that is enjoyable for the whole family. Cars is about a race car, Lightning McQueen, that seeks fame and happiness in in all the wrong places. He thinks true happiness is in fame, fortune, and fine oil. He later realizes that happiness is not found in those things but through friendships and the cars he cares about most. The authors very well got their point across. True happiness is found when you please those around you. This film is full of humor, heartwarming events, and is enjoyable for the whole family."
2,This Disney release was rushed.,"I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools. DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English. Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD. I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same."
3,Movie,"Though the movie came very promptly, and was packaged just as advertised, there was a glitch in the dvd and so the movie always skips at a certain place. The movie itself is a great story, very entertaining."
2,Grandson wouldn't sit through it,"I found the lack of people in this movie made it kind of silly. Who built the buildings, the racetrack, and the cars themselves? I thought it would have been a little bit more watchable if the cars had humans to deal and relate with. The cars could have spoke to one another on the sly so to speak.I know this movie was for kids, but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of thought that went into the making of it. I was truly bored along with my grandson trying to watch it."
5,Cars is excellent choice!,"After receiving this movie, I decided to go through the reviews, and was totally disgusted at many of the 1-star reviews. Those people totally downgrade every movie and make this movie to be all horrible when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about. I was appalled at that one moron who whined about how this isn't a good ""Christian"" movie because there's some name-calling in this movie by some of the cars in the script.Get a life, you schmuck. This isn't some Bible movie you bought, so get over it.This movie was excellent! I can watch it a thousand times and never get tired of it. I'm also looking into buying the sequel too. And considering that over 800 people made reviews of this movie and how barely a handful of them are one-star reviews, the others clearly know what they're saying when they claim this movie rocks the house.I'd give it a lot more than five stars, but that's clearly the highest you can go. What a shame!"
2,Dissapointing....,"I am a big Disney and Pixar fan. This film was watchable, but it was far from fantastic. My son, who loves cars, couldn't even sit through it. My husband and I fell asleep while watching this."
3,Over-rated,"Cute - I guess. Overrated. over Hyped. Everyone looooves it soooo much.. bla blaso, we bought it, watched it. yawn. fast forwarded it, and I did the story for everyone - he learns his lesson, he goes back, they live happily ever after, and on and on.sorry - I love Disney-type stuff. and had high hopes. but, it was boooooooring!"
5,"Incredible movie, original, like Pixar.","Pixar is amazing. There is no way of picking a favorite from pixar. Every movie they make is so original, funny and heartfelt. The really put their hearts into every movie they make.This movie is about a car who is selfish and through a life changing expericence with a small town, who changes into a good car.Great detail to everything in this film, down to every little tire mark on the roads and to the trip to california when you see different landmarks in different states.Nicole M*"
4,Good but not great compared to the Pixar classics.,"I liked CARS I really did like it but it lacks the magic of TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO. It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed. I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels. The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the ""mother road"" in the minds of younger generations. Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents. The characterizations of vehicles living in ""Radiator Springs"" were clever but came from central casting. The most original element of ""Cars"" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about. In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the ""planes"" leave car tracks in the sky."
5,Pixar Pleaser,"I love kids movies. I love animated movies. I am not a big Nascar or racing fan. So, I was a bit concerned about whether I would like this movie or not. However, from the beginning to the end I found a smile on my face. This is a great movie that is a lot of fun (whether you are a kid or a 36 year old kid like myself). Highly recommended."
5,One of the best animated features ever!,"Every medium has its own unique opportunities, with animation its the ability to express emotion that has universal appeal without all of the trappings that come with an actor of a specific gender, race, etc.The cars in Cars are more human than human. This is a very touching movie and true quality family fare. Its a great movie to buy- we watch it over and over and over."
5,Pleasing Grandkids,"This DVD has been purchased 3 times and requested twice, so I have no doubt it is a much loved movie. Amazon had the best price that I encountered."
5,cars movie,"WE really enjoyed this movie and our grandchildren loved it, I would recommend this movie to any age group."
3,"Kinda boring, kinda silly, but still top-notch animation","I know, I know, the middle of this film is actually supposed to be slow, because that's part of the idea: To make you feel what the protagonist felt. But I still think that this film was more of a flop for Pixar... I am grateful that they realized this and brought the magic back in Ratatouille."
4,Birthday Gift,This was a gift for my friend's little boy. He loved it! He would not put the DVD Cover down. He really enjoyed it when he seen the movie.
3,Pretty good for an animated car movie,"This isn't the type of film I'd watch on a regular basis, but I was on a plane and this was the featured movie so I tuned in. It was cute. The movie is about a truck that's friends with a race car, but another set of cars are plotting against the race car over a battle about oil. This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better. There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained. It's not the type of film I'd run out and buy, but I do think it'd be fun for kids and adults alike."
5,4 Tires Up!,Cars is visually stunning and the story was great. Get your kicks on Route 66! Watch it! Because I'm going to watch again sometime n theatres again sometime this summer. MAybe even more> That's how great this movie is! WATCH IT!
4,Spanish version CARS,"This is an interesting video as you can select English, Mexican Spanish, or Spanish. I suppose the Mexican Spanish must have diffent accents as well as slang words that vary from Spanish. Not being a Spanish speaker though I can not attest to this. My son loves the movie and has been speaking much more Spanish since the past few days of watching this video!"
5,EXCELLENT BLU-RAY TRANSFER,"This movie is an excellent blu-ray transfer; very crisp,clear and the colors were excellent. Pixar did a great job."
1,"? Sorry for purchase. Received ""Cars"" in a timely manner tho.","Fell asleep, saw the ending, and realized that I was sorry I bought it."
1,Are we numb?,"I am shocked. We just sat down to view this movie (after being told by many friends and relatives it was excellent)and I am still amazed at what I heard and saw. I even had to get up and check the box for the rating...I could not believe it was ""G"". The language was disgusting. I would not use the words ""idiot"" and ""moron"" in front of my children. I certinly do not want them to see it on T.V. And that is only a few of the less than wonderful terms that were used. The terrible crash scene, out running a train, trying to get another vehicle to crash...that's as far as I got and I shut it off. I am dissappointed that in todays world this is okay for our children to see. Not my kids.......I will throw it away..."
5,Excellent Movie,"Cars on Blu-Ray is really an excellent buy for anyone that likes Pixar flicks. I always enjoyed the movie itself, and when it became available on Blu-Ray, I had to buy it. I have not tried the extras yet, but the movie itself is flawless - I should mention I have the PS3 as playback device."
5,Great movie,Got it for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. Good movie for adults as well as kids.
5,CARS,"Once again, Disney/Pixar hits the mark. This is a funny movie with a moral. Thougoughly enjoyable for both kids and adults."
5,My 3 year old loves this movie!,I am very pleased with this transaction. Movie received in good condition and my child has proceeded to wear this movie out. He asks to see it every day sometimes twice a day.
5,Four Year Old Loves This Movie!,"This is my son's favorite movie at the moment. He acts out the scenes and I've even succumbed to the shameless product promotions and bought the toothpaste, hat and gloves set, house slippers and backpack. LOL...."
2,It's Okay,"I don't really like this movie. It never holds my children's attention for more than a half hour. I have a 2 year old boy and he doesn't even get into it. He loves cars but this just doesn't work on him. I find the movie pretty annoying, myself, compared to other Disney movies."
5,Excellent Movie for Children or adults,"This is one of the best movies for children in recent history. I think it is a toss-up with Monsters Inc. Well thought out, clean, moral and just plain funny with a very good lesson for children to learn about selfishness...Highly recommended! The sequel, in my opinion is an embarassment to this great movie.Mike"
4,Actually 4.5 stars would be my vote.,"I really like this feature length animated film. It's a lot of fun for the entire family and holds up to repeated viewings. The vocal performances by the cast are very nicely executed, it has a sweet moral integrity message, and EXCELLENT production quality overall. As an adult, however, I can't rate it up there with the best of this genre, which (in my opinion) include ""The Invincibles,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""Nemo,"" or ""Shrek"" for a few reasons. Although good, the writing seems a little less sophisticated, the jokes aren't quite as clever, and the plot is not as imaginative as one would hope. That said, ""Cars"" is a fine flick that I'm very happy to own."
4,Better for adults than for little kids...,"I am 62, and watched ""Cars"" with my granddaughter Brianna, who is seven. She liked it, but I enjoyed it more. Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want."
5,One of Disney/Pixar's Best,"This is a wonderful film for both children and adults. My kids, aged 6 1/2 and 3 years old, watch it at least once every 2 weeks and they do not get tired of it. I think the sound track is excellent--we have that CD as well. I love the way the main character, Lightning McQueen, who is all about himself and winning the Piston Cup (think NASCAR racing), eventually learns to value others and their relationships with him. It also gives my kids and myself a little history story about Route 66 and its importance to America. This DVD is very worth buying!"
3,Cars Movie Review,"The movie is Great!! Don't take me wrong. The reason why I gave 3 points instead of 5 is because of the languages issue. Disney's movies in the past gave you the options to buy multi-language movies, we are Latin's and we would like to pass that to our kids. Disney's translations to other languages are THE BEST so is a good teaching to our kids to watch the movie in Spanish one time and the next in English, like that they learns both languages well. But Now Disney doesn't give you the alternative to buy one movie with 3 options of languages on it. You have to buy EVERY version with the language you desire. Before you paid $23+ for a multi-language movie today you pay $15 for one with only the option in English."
5,Fantastic Movie,"I bought this movie for my son,who is crazy about cars,but belive me every one at home liked the movie a LOT.I got it at the cheapest rate possible at Amazon so this added to the FUN of watching the movie.I would say this is a MUST buy if you like movies..a movie for all ages"
3,Pixar can do better -- much better,"Pixar has quite a high bar to maintain and they falter a little on this one. Based on my 12 year old neice's suggestion, she and I watched this film. Pixar's usually pretty good right? Both of us at one point looked at each other about half way through to figure out what time it was. The film has great messages and wonderful animation but the execution is really flat and boring. Pixar is noteable for being exceptional, something that's hard to do with animated films that will be appealing to both kids and adults. It's enjoyable for the most part but this clearly is the first of the Pixar films to fall noticeably short."
1,Never buy from this company,Warning: Never buy from this company. I ordered this 6/20 and the payment was immediately taken from my account. Over a month has passed and I never received the video. An e-mail to the vendor via Amazon got no response whatsoever.
2,CARS World Premier,"I absolutely loved the premier. It was a movie for all genders and ages. I must admit that 'Mater' the toe truck, voice by Larry the Cable Guy, was the best part of the movie. If it weren't for him it wouldn't have been as good. I loved the movie and the showing at LMS was awesome despite the rain.Great Film"
1,REALLY BAD,I had really hoped this would be good but it was horrible. My kids only watched it once and never even wanted to see it again. I will never buy another pixar movie after seeing this. It seems like there just trying to take my money and produce nothing even close to entertaining. I feel very ripped off.
3,Not engaging,We are not race car people. This movie just didn't catch our attentions. The characters are cute but the story just wasn't for our family.
5,Cars,Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift. We used it already and recommend it to others.
5,Cars Movie,"Bought this for my 4 year old grandson's birthday, and had it sent to him in Texas, so I didn't see it personally. However, he loved the movie. :-)"
5,Cars,"Excellent movie, and great for both kids and adults. Happy to give it as a gift. Gift was greatly appreciated."
4,ADORABLE movie for everyone (even those like me who don't love annimation),"I was so reluctant to watch ""Cars,"" as I'm not into animated movies. To be honest, the few animated movies I have seen are all very good (Aladdin, The Lion King, and Beauty and The Beast), however I would never choose to rent one with so many other types of movies to watch. That is why I was so pleasantly surprised by ""Cars""- its a terrific movie whether you're 8 or 88- everyone will be able to relate and enjoy this heartwarming, hilarious, and very entertaining movie!"
5,Great Movie,My little girl loves this movie. Lots of bright colors and sounds!! Definitely recommend for anyone with small kids. Love it!
5,"Happy, Happy, Happy!!",My son loves this movie and I'm glad that I purchase both Cars and Cars 2. I received them together in a decent amount of time and both movies are in great condition. Very happy with my purchase!
2,Doc Hollywood Rehashed,"I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically ""Sullivan Travels"" or more exactly ""Doc Hollywood."" There is a little ""An officer and a Gentlemen"" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the ""Car"" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch ""Doc Hollywood"" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck."
2,predictable,"My kids liked it but honestly I thought it was predictable and boring. If you've seen Doc Hollywood, you've seen this movie."
5,LOVE IT,We watch CARS all the time. Everyone in the house enjoys the show. We had to get a couple of replacement DVDs of this show we like it that much around here.
4,kids love it,".... for some unknown reason along with their mommy, however i personally find 'over the hedge' better."
5,It drove me to intertainment.,Cars is a great addition to animated movies. It's a family movie that the whole family will enjoy.
5,AWESOME!,This film is just incredible. Everyone in the family should see it and will love it. This is on my personal top 5 all time kids film list and my son thinks its the best
5,"Wow, I LOVE THIS MOVIE","Oh my gosh, I am not certain who loves this movie more - us or our children. My two year old smiles from ear to ear every time we put it in to play. More astonishing, my 7 month old laughes, giggles and smiles throughout the entire DVD - he loves Mator and Lightening! Truly a great movie. Witty, charming and adults will LOVE it too! We know it word for word! We will even watch it afte rthey have gone to bed! Love it! Children of all ages will love it! It keeps things calm when we need to take care of household responsibilities! Enjoy!"
3,Right in the wrong ways.,"I am twenty-three and I've been a committed Pixar fan since Toy Story. I have every movie from Bug's Life to Incredibles; and I rate all but Bug's Life five stars. Cars was unfortunately not a five star, not even the four star of Bug's Life.I think Pixar has forgotten what they do. They created animated film that appeal to the family.Cars spends too much time on scenery, and it draws out each moment as if it were some drama reflecting the human condition. It has neither pep or comedy.What was done well, was not really what the movie should be. The most memorable moment is a long romantic drive between two talking cars."
1,48 hours *rolls eyes*,I rented this for my son cause I accidently deleted cars from our DVR and I figured thr would buy me some time to get to the store to buy it on DVD. My child watches this on a loop 24/7 and has a melt down when he can't. So it sucked majorly when after watching it one time it said he had no more time to watch it. When I rented it it said 48 hour rental so I assumed that ment we could watch however many time he wants in 48 hours. I guess that's not the case.
2,Movie not very realistic,"There is not a single person ever shown in ""Cars"". I don't think this is very realistic. In real life, you would see people walking around the streets, etc. After watching this DVD I left thinking ""Where were the people""?"
4,Cars,Our whole family really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and had a good story. I would recommend it to any family.
5,"Ooops, they did it again!","I never thought I'd see an animated film as good as Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but this one steals my heart! The CGI is simply mind-blowing--I don't think I've seen better. A must see for kids, the man of the house and even the ladies. How is it that PIXAR is able to keep churning out such wonderful flicks?"
5,How A CARtoon can make a grown man shed tears.,"I had avoided seeing this movie for some time. Although I love Pixar cartoons, this one just never did anything for me.Leave it to Pixar to surprise and delight.Having just turned 40 the movie resonated within me in a deeper way.Whether it was the fact that Radiator Springs had been seemingly left behind in the modern world, or the story of how Doc Hudson had grown old and forgetten, the theme of the passage of time really struck a chord.When lighting McQueen learns to forego winning in order to help the King finish the race, it is a moral and empathic moment for children of all ages.I don't collect DVD's personally, only for the kids, but this is one of the few that I might consider purchasing and stashing away to enjoy privately in a quiet moment.Highly Recommended!Cheers!"
4,"2-Disc version is out there, you just have to find it!","First let me say this is a ***** 5-star movie, it is the single disc DVD that reduces it by a star. But wait....Yes, there are 2-Disc versions of this classic-to-be Pixar movie, but the ""powers that be"" are making you look for them! Only certain U.S. retail store chains have gotten them and their second discs are different, so you have to buy them all to get all of the extras.Even the acclaimed Australian 2-Disc DVD doesn't have all of the extras that are on the U.S. retail stores second disc.Why Buena Vista decided to market this movie this way can only mean a real 2-Disc version will be made available to everyone next year after their exclusive contracts expire."
4,disney fun time,"my boys love this show ,from my now 5 year old to my now 2 years old boy they watch it every other night and i had went to a few online store with the constant viewing the disc gets scratched all the time when handled the wrong way i have purchased this dvd in the pass and it was exspensive but on amazon i find myself a whole new world at a fraction of the price ...."
5,For kids and their parents,"This is one of the few movies that will entertain parents and kids. One of the best movies of all times with a great story, great music and awsome animation. Can't wait for Cars II to come out next year!!"
1,I'm returning it,"It's a beautiful little box, but it didn't work for me. I bought it because I wanted to access the files in my old floppies. But when I inserted a disk, and clicked on the disk drive, a message opened asking if I wanted to format the disk. (This would wipe out all my files) I still don't know exactly why this happened (and I tried a handful of disks).As I looked at the customer info, I noted that it did NOT include Vista as one of the formats it runs on. And the SmartDisk customer service guy I talked to suggested that might be the problem. So I tried the floppy drive on another computer that runs XP, but with the same disappointing results.I'm sorry to say, I'm returning it."
5,External floppy disk drive,This disk drives works great. Still have a old floppy disks that I want to be able to read to find out what's on them. Easy plug and play.
2,SOME TIMES IT WORKS,SOME TIMES IT WORKS SOME TIMES NOT....THIS IS THE SECOND EXTERNAL I'VE HAD BUT THEY DONT SEEM TO WORK FOR LONG
2,Wrong External Floppy Disk Drive Sent,I was looking for a Floppy Disk Drive for my mac. The ad read for use with mac however when I received it was for a pc. It was a complete waste of time. I ended up purchasing one for a mac at the Micro Center here in Houston for the same price.
4,"Good dvd, Missing some videos though","The picture and the sound quality of the video is rather good. Only things I dislike about the dvd is that it's missing some videos (A Change [Second version which IMO is much better], Can't Cry Anymore, The Difficult Kind [live with Sarah Mclaughlan], There Goes The Neighborhood [Live in Central park, this version is on the dvd that comes with the deluxe edition of The Very Best of cd], Sweet Child O'Mine, and the James Bond: Tomorrow Never Dies video). The ""live"" video for First Cut would have been intresting to see if i didnt already own the C'mon America 2003 dvd (which is one of her best performances), I would have rather had one of the above (or all of) the mentioned missing videos on the dvd.All In all it is a good dvd though containing most of Sheryls videos. Who knows maybe in 10 more years we'll get the missing videos on another best of dvd and I'' be able to rate it 5 stars then"
4,It's Just so Cool !!!,"Believe it or not I don't own any Crow cds(sorry, Sheryl).However I really love these songs and videos. 2 great surprises for me were the punky 80's style 'There goes the neighborhood' and the BW documentary 'Home'. My favorite song is still the Squeezeesque 'My Favorite Mistake' although the video lacks just a bit. Anyway, take advantage of this special price. You'll appreciate it on some level. That's a promise."
4,Sections on Strategy Implementation are excellent,"I have not read the whole book, just the sections on Strategy Implementation. These are excellent and cover all of the pertinant types - functional, matrix etc. Our IT department is going through the traditional Devloved/Central/Hybrid review and coverage of this is excellent.Note - I am not in a position to critise or evaluate against current, leading edge thinking - I am in the process of studying for an MBA, I'm not a lecturer in a business school."
1,Was a good card - no support for Vista,This card crashed Vista if I tried to logoff or switch users with an ati2dvag.dll error. ATI's website say's it won't support any of it's products older than 9600. ATI is lame. Go with EVGA.
2,Nice Case! Poor Clip:(,This leather case is a very well made protector for your Zire 72 until the clip breaks and the case falls to the floor. The Covertec company will not offer a replacement clip. They will let you purchase a whole new system.Check EBay for JP'S case.
4,Not ideal for mathematicians,"This book is not ideal for mathematicians. It is written in the style of a physics book, with a large portion of the book devoted to experimental results; the theory is developed in the context of explaining these results, with little mathematical discussion of the resulting equations beyond asymptotic analysis. (This may be expected, given the word ""Physical"" in the title.)Overall it is a nice book. But the writing is not as clear as it could be. Some relevant properties of the example flows discussed are not stated explicitly, which I would discover by chance while working with the equations. Many of his derivations are also predicated by overly restrictive/unnecessary assumptions, with no mention of the behavior under other assumptions (although the problems require determining this in order to solve them). He leaves too much as an (often unstated) exercise for the reader. This is the reason I did not rate it five stars."
1,Non-artistic renderings,"We volunteer in Rwanda and love African music, but this was not good. It is realistic though in that it is not polished, balanced or edited in any fashion, but without the visual of the dance it just doesn't do it for me."
5,a great foundation piece,This album is a great addition to a music library that truly encompasses the music our great world has to offer. My students (high school) request this to be played when they are working on projects during class time.
3,Colts Flag,"I really liked the colors on the flag,the size, and the logo itself. I, however, was not satisfied in the description of how the flag would hang from the flag post. There was no meantion of it needing rope or being closed at the one end. It was unfortunately a christmas present for another member of my family. :("
3,A Roller Coaster Ride,"This love story went everywhere, anywhere you can imagine. I had trouble putting it down so I could sleep. There were elements of the story that had me scratching my head, a little confused by some of the characters' actions, but the non-stop action holds the reader's interest.It's a quick read."
1,Too Simplistic Too Be Real,"I'm alwyays looking for historical Native American romances to read because I tend to favor them and there are few out there that do them justice. I chose this book because I basically the premise. The idea of a white girl getting captured at a young age by Indians and growing up among them was very interesting. What I found hard to believe as I continued reading was how easy Wolf Shadow found her. It was just too much of a coincedence that she happened to be living in the village where he grew up. When they were both captured by the Crow, she didn't seem too distraught when she thought her family was killed and for that matter neither did he about his. There just wasn't any depth to this book. She just put pieces together that seemed to flow into one another but they didn't have too much feeling to them. If you're looking for a good Native American historical read Comanche Moon by Catherine Anderson."
2,mother twilight,"They have better stuff. I only enjoyed one song, ""Catch Me"". The rest isn't really justifying the cost of an entire album."
2,Not custom fit!,"This item is NOT custom fit, it is generic. I put it in my truck which Amazon said it fit and it doesn't even fit in it. I will say this, it is DEFINITELY high quality and durable for whatever it does fit. Very disappointed in time and money spent on this item."
1,"This is a ""Custom Fit?""","I input my vehicle make and model, ordered these mats, and they did not fit. Too long and too wide."
3,Could be a better fit,"These were said to fit our 1998 Subaru Forrester (only 48,000 miles!). They do not fit real well but they are good enough."
2,1995 Nissan Pathfinder Mats,"Although, they say these fit a 1995 Pathfinder they are to big. They will work but the fit is not what I expected."
5,Engrossing Read!,"This was my first foray into this genre. I couldn't put the book down. It was so different from the usual lesbian romance stories that I'm used to. I enjoyed the story, but of course I hate the ending! It was easily worth the $20 paid. I certainly hope there is a sequel. The main characters were so interesting and exciting; I want to read more about them! I completely disagree that this book is ""lesbian porn."" There is a great love story here, it's not just about sex."
4,More Trans-gendered than Lesbian,"A Taste for Blood was a decent read, however the main character Ryan is more trans-gendered than lesbian. She walks around with a strap-on in her pants and with her supernatural vampire powers she transmits to others the illusion that she is a man. And the sex scenes are very heterosexual considering Ryan is practically a man! So if you are into the whole hard-core so butch I am practically a man with a woman type stuff than this is the book and sex scenes for you. However if you are a lesbian because you want no part of a penis (like myself) I wouldn't recommend this book for you, what kept my interest was my love for vampires."
2,Bad editing AND clumsy paragraph formatting RUIN this book,"Bought the book after reading a review in On Our Backs magazine and was shocked.All the reviews I read claimed she was comparable to Anne Rice. If that isn't an overstatement, I don't know what is. What a laugh! The quality of the writing was so-so NOT rich like the front cover claims. The tone of the words/writing didn't seem to match the setting of the story. Combination of various subtle mistakes destroy the enjoyment of it.A lot of grammatical errors like then instead of than!!!Plus some pages were double-spaced while others were single ..ughhhEven if it's intended to be a cheap trill, it's horrific. You want poetic writing? Engaging story? Forget it. Want some real erotica? Get Anne Rice's Trilogy!! (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty etc.)"
1,glorified porn,bought this book after reading a positive review from the online community i belong to. i was sadly disapointed. this is nothing more than glorified lesbian porn. now dont get me wrong i have nothing agaisnt lesbians or porn- but if you are expecting a great vampire story this is not it. dont waste your money and time. the characters are one deminsional(lol i probably spelled that wrong) at best and the ending is rushed. the only possible good parts are all copied from other authors. i dont know what to recommed in stead if you have already read all of anne rice's stuff.
3,Not good enough for running.,"I bought this product because I wanted to hear radio when I am running. But this product could not keep signal of a station. Maybe this is bacause physical location keeps changing as I run. So, I have to tune the signal all the time. If I do not tune the channel. It makes too much noise. So, currently, I don't use this product. I think I will buy MP3 player with Armband. Armband of this product is good."
4,Good value,Good value at a good price. The mechanical dial interface is simple and likely to last longer than any digital/button interface.
2,You get what you pay for -- little,"I bought this for my 3x a week gym workouts while I was on the treadmill, tuned in to the gym's TVs. Reception was satisfactory for the TV signals, but was fuzzy for outside FM stations. AM reception was non-existant. But the third week/10 uses, the ear phones were not working. The battery cover pops off with any kind of contact. I'm going to buy something more durable with digital tuning."
5,I like it!,"I like to listen to an AM radio call-in show while I'm on the treadmill at the gym. I did not want to spend much on a new radio - after all, AM radio technology has been around forever.It's hard to find an AM radio that doesn't have rotten ratings. When I saw this radio for $5 and it had reasonable ratings, I jumped. I paid just as much for shipping but for $10, I am very happy. If you can find this radio in your local store, grab it and save yourself the shipping.I used the radio for the first time this morning and it worked just fine. I appreciated the dial tuner because it gave me maximum control to get the best reception. Ear buds don't work for me because they don't stay in my ears (maybe I'm deformed) but the ear buds that came with the radio appeared to be of normal quality.The only semi-negative comment that I can think of is that the round face of the radio is bigger than I expected. It kinda looks like a large compass. It's about 2.5"" in diameter."
3,EXCELLENT PRODUCT BUT...,"The product description should specify the type of opening of the bottle (e.g. spray, plug, cap). The large size (excellent value!) makes the simple ""hole"" on top rather awkward to use."
5,Great!,"The product was delivered on time and I love this product. I was expecting a spary type bottle but it comes out pourable. Anyways, I love the product and its comes as what I expected. Thanks."
5,A Great Read,"Not only is Professor Rhodes's book far from boring, but rare in that it allows easy access to a scholar's interpretation of Greek architecture. I was lucky enough to have been a student in a few of the Professor's classes. A wonderful read for those expanding their knowledge on Greek architecture, or those just beginning."
4,great original taste,"if you need rum cake, they make the best. i often get this item now and then. will buy again ofcourse"
5,DELICIOUS & MOIST!!!,"We ate this on our Caribbean Cruise two years ago. I found it on amazon.com this Christmas, and bought it for my boyfriend. It tasted delicious, and brought back wonderful memories of our cruise to the Caribbean. I strongly recommend this to anyone. PS. This is the perfect gift for anyone. I don't like rum, but I love this cake. My boyfriend likes rum and also loves this cake. Enjoy! :)"
3,Didn't quite live up to the hype,"I'm not a big fan of rum cake, but my family loves it, so I bake it for them sometimes on special occasions. I had heard that Tortuga rum cakes were amazing, so this year I bought one to serve as part of our NYE buffet. Everyone said they liked it okay, but they said it really didn't have a great rum flavor and the texture was kind of heavy--maybe because it comes vacuum packed. I think it's probably a good cake, but my family is just used to having a fresh baked one that's soaked in a specific kind of rum."
5,Yummy Awesomeness!!!,This rum cake is awesome. It is so moist and delicious. They did not skimp on the rum when they made this awesome cake!
4,Tortuga Rum Cake,"I had first tasted this cake at the store in Key West. In fact, I tried every flavor of the free samples they had available. For years, I have wanted to order one of these cakes, but the minimum order from the Tortuga catalogue was more than I wanted to deal with. Besides that, the shipping and handling was quite high. When I saw the cakes available through Amazon, I still thought they were pricey, but super-saver free shipping was available, so I ordered two cakes, one for my family and one for a friend. The cake did not dissapoint. It was delicious, moist and delicious, and the rum was not overpowering. By eating just a sliver at a time, my husband, son, and I made the 16oz cake last nearly a week. It was a nice holiday treat."
1,rum cake,expected some sweetness and all I received was bitterness - I threw it out. Box was pretty though - but would not buy again
1,Don't waste your money,"This first time I bought this cake was a couple years ago and it was good. Now, (received 1/12/13) this cake is just not the same. Maybe they are cutting cost, but it is dry and there's not even a hint of butter or rum flavoring. Maybe they are under new management, I don't know, but don't waste your money. Shame on you Tortuga..."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"I was very disappointed with this product. I ordered it because it was highly recommended on the Food Network and also on the Travel Channel. I did not think the cake had much rum taste (sort of like it had been sprinkled very lightly with the Carbbean rum) and it was much more dense than I thought it would be. I tried ""doctoring"" it up a bit with more liquor, whipped cream, etc without success. Although one could eat it, it was not the best and I wound up throwing half of it out. I would suggest saving your money and making your own Bacardi Rum cake. You will be much happier with the product."
2,disappointing,"The Cake was not what I expected , to have a name like Tortuga on it and be from the The Caribbean. I wanted alot more rum in the cake. I will not purchase this again. It was so so."
3,Pretty good cake but my homemade is still better!,Not bad cake but happily my homemade is still better.
1,READ THE INGREDIENTS!,"I think anyone who reads the ingredients on this stuff and continues to buy them is not paying attention. Try smoking, testing for voltage with your tongue, or jogging along a congested highway (carbon monoxide & physical dangers); maybe some more partially hydrogenated oils - trans-fats, Aspartame (diet pop), processed cake mixes, or statin drugs. Those will do it just as fast if you are trying to self distruct. It's all friends of the fda approved and tastes ok, so....yo ho ho, eat up me hearties!Or, pay attention.Updated 8-10-12.Looks like some dislike reality."
5,Caribbean Rum Cake Extraordinaire,"WOW!!! This Rum Cake was an unbelievable surprise. The description was intriguing so I added it to my order. My mother used to make rum cake and I thought she used a lot of rum. Wow! The Tortuga was practically dripping with a delightful light, full bodied rum. The cake was moist, and delightful to the palate. Since I was not familiar with the Tortuga I was hesitant to gift it. Am I ever glad that I kept it to check it out."
2,Nothing special,"What with the high price and nice packaging, I was expecting a lot more from this cake. I could easily bake a much better cake at half the cost and twice the quality. I don't know what all the hype is all about.It is a sponge cake with rum in it .. big deal."
5,Tortuga Rum Cake,The rum cake came right on time in the exact condition described by the seller. The cake tasted really good. My girlfriend and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
2,No Rum,"Great cake, could not taste any rum. I could have purchased a vanilla pound cake at my local supermarket for 1/2 the price."
1,hmmmm,It's a great cake moist and rummy!!! But when it got to me it was moldyy I had it before for Christmas from a gift basket this time I ordered it through amazon and it came in moldyy I had to throw it away what a tragic waste!
4,Great,"We picked up three of the small cakes in the Bahamas, Original, Coconut, and Pineapple. Outstanding my favorite was the original which had walnuts. I wanted to try it with ice cream , but I finished them before I could get any ice cream."
4,AN AVERAGE FIGHTER WITH MONSTERS 7.25 OUT OF 10,"King of the Monsters is your average fighting game. The only things are that you face monsters and you can destroy cities to be the most kickass monster around. The gameplay works like both a fighting and a wrestling game, you take out health, and you have to pin down your opponent to the count of three to win. The basic fighting moves are all there; kicking, punching, grappling, etc. This game manages to provide a decent level of fun, but unfortunately it comes up short due to some issues. First, it takes a long time, yes, a long time to defeat your opponent, so you will be sitting there for a while trying to be the ultimate monster. If you're looking for an out-of-the-ordinary game for the Super Nintendo, King of the Monsters is one of your best bets. If only the dreadfully repetitive Super Godzilla had been like this game instead of being the repetitive piece of crap it is."
4,I Love Quansut Huts,I've always loved Quonset huts. And I see modern barns today that look like a Quonset's.This is a good history book.
2,history not good for ideas,simply a history of the quonset hut not as many examples as i thought there would be.
4,Bon appetit!,"This 2CDs set is quite a good compilation of arias from Mozart's best known operas. The cast is awesome, too.The trouble is Mozart wrote so many wonderful arias that when you try to compile them from many operas, lots of the great ones like 'Non piu di fiori' and 'Deh per questo istante solo' from La clemenza di Tito get left out (tho having Teresa Berganza's version of 'Parto ma tu ben mio' makes up for it somewhat). A lot of chorus pieces from Idomeneo but none of Idamante's arias, no Elettra's famous rage aria, and no 'Traurigkeit' from 'Die Entfuehrung'?Bottom line, there's a good mix of arias of all varieties, and all are marvelously sung (especially the Cosi fan tutte trio 'Soave sia il vento' with Lorengar, Berganza, and Bacquier). I think the line up could have been better, tho. It won't fill you up, perhaps, but it will wet your appetite for complete set of the operas included."
3,Mega Man isn't shooting anything special this time around,"The problem with Mega Man Soccer is that neither soccer nor Mega Man fans will enjoy it. I think the challenge is set unnecessarily high, too. I want to win *sometimes*. The reviewer below is correct in that there's no ending. This game was just a cheesy experiment that thankfully never had a sequel. Not worth the heavy price tag at all."
2,"OK as an introduction, not useful for the experienced trader","This text quickly covers a large variety of topics in shallow detail. If you need to be told that you should cut your losses and let your winners run, then this is your book. If you want a text that will help you find winners (or the losers you are supposed to avoid in the first place) you best look elsewhere."

4,One of the twentieth century's best...,"This book of free verse and prose poetry is intellectually passionate in its offerings of slices of life and symbolic imagination by Elizabeth Bishop, a true, 20th century master. I found my breath taken away quite often by the marvels of imagery unearthed inside her lines. This is poetry that is not rushed, patient enough to unveil its mysteries at a logical pace. It’s hard to refute the certitude of her visualizations. Instead, I just enjoy, bathe in the overflow of exact verbiage. Ultimately, I am always moved, because her own personal darkness is couched in the characters and situations she inhabits. Never boring, since Elizabeth’s gift was to know how to give us a fascinatingly otherworldly understanding of ourselves."
4,Intrigued by seeing the book in a movie scene,"I first heard Ms. Bishop's poems while watching Cameron Diaz struggle with the text, as part of her character's struggle with being a ""failure"". The text of the poem was appropriate and the clean clear language of Ms. Bishop's poem was clearly understood! I will be purchasing to learn more of this lovely woman!"
4,Wonderful Images,"If you like images and not abstracts in poetry, Elizabeth Bishop's Complete Poems is a wonderful collection. She works very hard to create poetry void of direct emotion. She lets the reader apply their own emotion to the descriptions and images in her poetry. Read, enjoy and for those of us learning, this is a wonderful reference."
5,Great poetry,"We all know that Elizabeth Bishop was a great poet but this book, with the complete poems, give you a deeper understand her work."
4,Canada to Brazil,"Bishop writes powerful and poignant poetry. She succeeds especially at embodying emotion in her poetry through the use of complex stylistic devices, as well as a superb command of the English language. I'd give the book five stars, but I think it lacks biographical information on the author which makes her already beautiful verse absolutely brilliant. Bishop has a way of discussing loss so that it is actually felt by even the casual reader, creating intense emotions that do not subside when the book is put down. A must read for fans of Marianne Moore, look especially at poems such as ""One Art"" and ""Paris, 7 a.m."" which demonstrate the breadth and depth of her incredible talent."
5,"NOT THEIR BEST, BUT A SOLID EFFORT! 4 1/2 STARS!","This is another great album by a band you have never heard! Pumped up melodic punk that is very contagious. If you never heard these guys, your missing something special! Check these guys out!"
3,Strange Verse,"I guess I didn't notice that the content is verse. Otherwise, I might not have ordered this book. These short free verse poems are what you might expect from a young creative looking for a medium. As such, I found a few passages that struck me, but most seemed to be so ideosyncratic to be inscrutible--you had to be there. The illustrations are amateurish. I'll put this on the free paperback rack in the company cafeteria (and hope I see who picks it up)."
3,An average nba game,"this game is pretty slow. another thing is the sounds during the game is very boring. on the other hand this game has some signature moves of star players such as michael jordan and shawn kemp. overall this game is average. if you like to see the signature moves get this one. if not, tecmo super nba basketball is for you as this game is better in terms of gameplay."
1,Disappointed viewer,"Sure, for only $5 or so it sounds like a great deal. But what I dislike about this packaging, like so many DVDs, is that they do not provide details of the contents. There are only 4 episodes. The particular purpose for me buying this video was the early year indicated on the package. Yet only 1 episode contains the young boys. The boys are all grown up and working at the law firm for the rest of episodes. So, I say, like Aunt Bee says, ""fiddle faddle."""
3,Soft and fuzzy,"You can probably find this DVD at a $1.00 or $0.99 bargain store and that is where it belongs. Three of the four episodes are from either VHS or many generation dupes of soft film prints. The four episodes are in order: Halloween Party with a very young Ricky; Rick Gets Even, with Ricky at 16 or 17 years; The Duenna with Ricky at about 12; and, An Evening with Hamlet, with Ricky around 9 or 10. Only Rick Gets Even is from a good, sharp print. The other three are watchable but there are many other collections with better such as those from the Shout Factory or Mill Creek. Watching these on a good monitor only decreases viewing pleasure, so watch on a small portable DVD player or computer screen."
1,Burned a hole right through the back!,While cooking it started smoking and created a tremendous static electric charge against anybody who came near. Turns out it was burning a slice right through the metal backing.Too bad there aren't negative star ratings.
1,Smoke Machine,"14 months after purchasing the microwave it suddenly started making a realy strange sound and was pouring out smoke everywhere. The noise and the smoke continued until I stopped the microwave. I don't know what would have happened if I was not standing right there, burn down the house??"
2,Short lived,"I really liked this microwave... until last night... 15 months after I purchased it, it kept turning off after about 10 seconds with a strong electrical smell. 15 months is hardly satisfactory."
4,Blast from the past,"This game is a challenge, I look at it now and wonder how I beat it as a kid. Other than that it's all that I remembered, so if you played it as a kid then I suggest this as one of the games you replay."
4,Fun But Not Friendly,"This --adult-- cookbook lots of b/w photos, short bios on the famous chefs, and lots of FROM SCRATCH recipes. (Unlike other Easy-Bake cookbooks!) The recipes are sophisticated and can contain ingredients like capers, Chineese cabbage, and Grand Mariner. It might be suitable for children with more refined tastes (the ones who eat more gelato than jello) to use with parent supervision. I've made a few of the recipes, and enjoyed the results. While I enjoyed the book I do have one major gripe -- all too often the authors have a recipe that reads something along the lines of ""makes 12 cakes, cooked one at a time."" Get real -- how hard would it have been for the publisher to scale the recipes? This isn't a big concern for adults, possibly, as we can just prepare one in the Easy-Bake oven and the rest in the conventional one, but I think an Easy-Bake cookbook should have been Easy-Bake friendly. If you're looking for a from-scratch child's cookbook try the Mommy and Me cookbook."
3,Good Customer Service,I ordered this book and unfortunately the book arrived later than expeccted. I contacted the seller and he provided excellent customer service. Thank You
2,Why buy this book?,"There is no point to buy this book. Especially, if you are planning on installing a wiring kit in your car and if you are going to buy from Painless wiring. All pictures are taken from the Painless wiring instruction manual and you will save yourself 20 bucks if you don't buy this book. I am actually quite surprised that he didn't get sued from Painless wiring for using all their pictures. Nothing new is told that you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself, and the things you can't figure out, are not told."
3,Not for the beginer.,"The book suggests that you will be able to create a wiring harness after you read it. I believe if you are a mechanic and understand exactly what your vehicle does already, you might be able to. If you are not, don't expect to do much more than you already know how. It doesn't even serve as much of a reference book. Maybe you will find it helpful. I was majorly dissappointed."
3,Moderately informative,I purchased this book looking for some auto electrical information and was relatively satisfied with the content. It is the most informative auto electrical book I have purchased thus far. I would recommend it to anyone who has some experience with auto electrical systems.
2,Mario does homework,"I bought this game back in July of 1994. First you set the time machine for the date and place you need to go. Next it shows you riding a jetski on the lake. There are mushrooms on the lake. Grab ten of the mushrooms and drive your jetski into one of the portals. This will take you to the times and places you need to go.I bought this game because it was a time travel game but it was a disappointment. When you travel places, you have to answer questions like a test at school. You do no fighting of any kind. There is no action in it.MTM would probably be great for children because it's educational. But I seriously don't recommend it for adults. This and Timeslip are the two worst time travel games made."
1,honestly,"I'd really want to give this game zero stars but i can't. I'll tell you the truth. This game [stinks]. C'mon, a game that teaches you history?This si the worst Mario title ever, no doubt. Unless your a freaking nerd,dont waste you money on this one."
1,BOOO,don't be fooled I'm one mario fan but in this game you answer homework? SNES games are meant for fun. Lookin for a good mario SNES game? Get Mario RPG
2,Incredibly untrue to the Franchise,"The game isn't remotely like any other Mario game. Regardless, I always found myself enjoying the game."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am interested in starting a direct marketing business and thought the title of this book was just what I needed. Besides, it is written by a full collection of professionals. But once you start reading it, you realize these guys missed the internet boat. There are a few interisting points, here and there, but you could get them in almost any direct marketing book."
5,"An excellent, easy-to-understand guide to statistics.","Since I got this book two years ago it has become well-worn with my constant thumbing through it. It has proven an invaluable resource for doing statistics in papers and reports I have been writing. I'm in graduate school studying economics, policy, environmental studies and public policy issues and this book has been very helpful in teaching me and reminding me of statistical methods to use, without overwhelming me. It's easy to read and the explanations are well thought out."
3,This is felt?,"I purchased this uninked stamp pad to use for cookie decorating. Based on the other review, I assumed I was getting a pad that was made of felt and not foam. As indicated in the photo, the pad claims to be felt. I have been sewing for over 40 years, and I have never seen any felt that looks like this! It appears to be a a thin piece of cotton placed over a thicker material. Perhaps the thicker material underneath is some sort of felt, but you can see from my photo that the top material easily frays. It is definitely not what I was expecting. I haven't used it because my customized stamp hasn't arrived yet, but if my opinion on the pad changes once I try it for my cookies, I will update my review. For now I am a little disappointed."
4,Boom Shucka Lacka,"This is the best NBA game on the SNES. It's sequel ""Tournament edition"" is pretty good, but this one was the original and best. Tho there is only 2 players on each team, the best bit about it was not only the fun you had in multiplayer mode, but seeing who could smash the backboard in the 4th quarter. You could only smash it if you kept jamming all through the game with your big 50 foot in the air slam dunks (unrealistic, but fun!) and the backboard would eventualy shatter. That never was incorperated into NBA JAM T.E unfortunalty. But this game was hours of fun, and with cool codes to enter too for unlimeted fire, dunks from half court ect...Unfortunatly there's no Michael Jordan.. Shaq, Charles Barkly and Gary Payton where in certain releases of this game, a few original copys, but there hard to come by or know which versions where which?This is still the best NBA JAM game on any system, if it hasnt already, this will most likely end up seeing new light on the Game Boy Advance."
5,Good Even Today,NBA Jam is a great NBA game. Its challenging and very fun at the same time. You have to choose one of the two players on the team you've chosen to control and the other is your teammate. A great sports game for the SNES.
3,WHOO-HOO!!! I wrote the first review of this game!,"This game is sort of hard to play, even with all the new systems that have come out since Super NES. I still like PLaystation, but NBA Jam is still pretty cool! Can you smellllllll what the--- whoops! Wrong quote! Bring it on BABY!!!!!!!"
1,Not helpful,"There is much material with this course-all worthless. If you want to read 100's of phrases and then hear them on cd, then this will work. If you want to be taught, this is not for you. It is a list of phrases, the end. The dictionary lettering is so small as to be unreadable. The travel phrases are on a tiny accordion card. This is truly not worth having."
2,Who needs this [...] when there are better PODCASTS?,"There are so many awesome podcasts for language that do a much better job teaching the language. I think they're better because they lack the stilted artifice so common with language CD's such as this one. Moreover, the speakers on the podcasts speak slowly, giving you the chance to really practice. Last, that's the best way to acquire a second language because it more closely approximates the way we all learn our first language - from our slow speaking mommies!And the podcasts are free!"
2,Not for a drive.........,"These Audio CD's (with what I thought was supplemental written materials) were purchased for learning in the car and are pretty useless without reading the accompanying books prior to listening to the CD's. I have only listened to the first one - and it is just lists of names/words. These may be a good complete beginner course, but definitely not an audio one."
1,Useless waste of time,"I bought this for my fiance to use in the car as he travels a lot. I listened to it myself and found it to be very unhelpful.The CD's did not explain anything, or why they just repeated words.Not a trational way to learn a language.Not useful at all - try a different one."
4,THIS WAS DONE MUCH BETTER THAN THE U.S. VERSION,"THIS IS THE BEST P.E. COLLECTION THAT YOU CAN GET RIGHT NOW. ALL OF P.E.'S GREATEST HITS FROM 1988-1994 ARE ALL ON HERE. WHILE THIS COLLECTION HAS 4 EXTRA SONGS THAT THE U.S. VERSION DOESN'T HAVE, IT STILL FORGETS TO INCLUDE SONGS FROM ''YO BUM RUSH THE SHOW''. WHILE THEY DO HAVE SUCH CLASSICS AS ''WELCOME TO THE TERRORDOME'', ''BLACK STEEL IN THE HOUR OF CHAOS'', ''SHUT EM DOWN'', ''DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE'', AND OTHERS, THEY STILL FORGOT TO PUT ''MIUZI WEIGHS A TON'', ''PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1'', AND ''TOO MUCH POSSE'' ON THIS CD. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS STILL A GOOD CD TO HAVE IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE COLLECTING ALL THEIR ALBUMS FROM THE 1988-1994 TIME PERIOD. (...)"
1,Old Crap,"This CD is horrible, its mostly talking with old sounding vocals. Juvenile sounds a lot younger and it's not even in his famous style. What is the point of this CD release?!?! The beats are good if you're into old school bass beats. Avoid this CD, its weird as hell"
3,the truth,"This cd is DJ Jimi. I'm from New Orleans and Juvi is only on a few tracks. This stuff came out around 92 or something. Its total bounce, but the N.O. was big in that back then"
1,This cd is [bad],"I went to the store and saw this cd on the rack in the front so I thought juvenile got a new cd out, but I thought it was weird cuz I didnt here about it. Then I took it home and listened to it and it was the worst 15 dollars I ever spent. Juvenile was in the first 5 seconds of one song and the rest was dj jimi. He shouldnt even be a dj he is wack. So if you see this dont let it fool you its not juvenile its just a sick trick to waste peoples money"
3,I totally agree - is this Juvy?,Good beats and all. but maybe this is a different juvenile... I don't here juvy in this at all...
2,its aight,"this cd is aight, the beats arent to bad but it dont sound like juvi,dont buy it if u think it has anything to do with cash money cause it dont, i wouldnt really recomend it, so if u see it in a store its not a new juvenile cd its old tracks piled up and put on a cd and doesnt sound like him"
2,Ya'll Just Don't Understand,"I haven't heard this yet, but you've got this mess wrong if you think this is a ""new"" Juvenile CD. This is acctually a compilation of his stuff from when he was just a bounce rapper. Way before he ever joined up with Cash Money. So for ya'll saying he's getting wacker, this is just some old ish. I mean really, you think Cash Money would let a song be produced without Manny? It just doesn't work like that. This was just for your edification though."
1,Umm... this cd sux,i listened to this crap and it sucked. i wouldn't recommend anyone buying it because it's terrible. i wish i could rate it no stars but i had to rate it with 1 star.
2,Is This Juvenile?,"This album was terrible from the beginning. DJ Jimi is terrible, puts together beats that do not make sense. Where is Mannie Fresh when you need him? I hope this album is one that we can put behind us. It's said to see that someone with once half-decent material produced this eleven track piece of garbage. Is this the end of Cash Money?"
3,aight,"its aight, aside the fact it dont even SOUND like juvie. the flow is pretty good, and the beats is nice. this aint even cash money, 50's the massacre is better than this, and thats sayin something"
3,It's aight,I kind of like it because it sounds like dj jubilee. zi wouldn't buy it but i'll burn it.
1,THIS AIN'T NO CASH MONEY CD!,"I'M REAL SHOCKED AT THE FACT THAT THE SAME MAN WHO RECORDED THE SONGS TO THIS WACK CD BACK IN 1994 IS ACTUALLY THE SAME MAN WHO WOULD LATER GRACE HIP HOP WITH SONGS LIKE ''BACK THAT THANG UP'', ''HA'', AND ''SET IT OFF''. THIS SO CALLED ALBUM IS JUST A COLLECTION OF SONGS THAT WERE MADE BEFORE ''BEING MYSELF'', WHICH WAS JUVENILE'S 1ST CD. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS CD IS THAT EVERYTHING SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME, AND THE RHYMES THAT JUVI KICKS ARE SUPRISINGLY WACK. OH, AND ANOTHER THING, JUVI RAPS WITH DJ JIMI FOR MUCH OF THIS ALBUM. FOR ALL JUVE FANS, STICK WITH ''400 DEGREEZ'' OR ''PROJECT ENGLISH''."
3,Its aiight,"Tha dude that gave this cd 5 stars dont know whats hes talkin bout.1. this cd aint that great its like a juvenile juvenile,like he didnt go through puberty or summtin.2. dj jimi isnt many fresh.dj jimi is a totally differant new orleans dj."
5,It's Juvenile,This is the best cd of 2000 because its just the typically cash money southern flavor. Juvenile has done it again and for anyone who buys this cd he is not letting you down. If you have every cash money cd you must buy this one and even if you have never heard cash money this would be a great cd to start your collection with.
3,Interesting Assembly of Talent,Hard to see how some are considered professionals with such a wacky view of reality. Who's responsible for the review of attendees. It's more like the cast of a Coast to Coast AM show.
1,Rusted and corroded,They looked nice when I received them. Both are rusted and corroded after 10 months. Don't waste your money. I am looking for different product to replace this set.
1,2 sets: both rusted,"The finish is lousy. After first set rusted, i called the company and they were good enough to send a replacement set. It rusted as well. If they hadn't rusted, I would have been very happy with the look and feel of this product."
2,Got rusty,"I am reviewing this three years after the purchase. There is rust on both shakers. Apart from that, worked fine."
1,Toxic carbon steel.,"I got an Olde Thompson salt grinder. After some weeks using it, the salt started coming out of the grinder with an unappetizing, suspicious green color. First I thought there was a problem with the sea salt but then I realized that the grinding mechanism was releasing that green material. Scratching the supposedly steel grinder component, it tears apart the crud. The mechanism is crumbling in green dust. I instantly discarded the whole grinder because of how toxic that carbon steel could be. I am really dissappointed with the Olde Thompson grinder."
3,Rusting,"I thought these were great initially, but within the first year, they rusted and cannot be fixed.Had I thought about it, and about how stainless steel frigs do, I would have oiled them and made sure to keep them that way. But I didn't.Also, for me, the salt shaker doesn't release enough salt and I can never tell how much is coming out."
2,Rusted after 7 months,This is an attractive set when new and the grinder works well. I purchased mine new in February and it's just October. The outer veneer of both the salt shaker and the pepper grinder is now dull and covered in rust spots. I live in Maryland where it's really not *that* humid. The set is still useable for everyday home use but I wouldn't set it on the table for guests. I'll have to find a new set for that purpose.
4,Solid Option,Nice set. Great for cooking or serving but I use them for cooking. I think they will last a longgggg time
1,Rusted within a couple of weeks,"These Peppermill and Salt shakers looked great when we received them but within a couple of weeks both rusted and now look terrible. The Peppermill still works, but the Salt Shaker barely dispenses any salt anymore. I was very disappointed."
4,grinder,"well this thing works just fine, i like it , you can adjust the size of the pepper coming out which is good. i have been looking for an inexpensive grinder nothing too fancy and this is it, O make sure you get the pepper while your on the web site is was not in the stores i shop,and what they sell ihas tons of flavor !!!"
4,A nice addition to our dinner table.,"We've had these salt and pepper shakers for more than 6 months now and I can't think of anything bad to say about them. They're good looking, the pepper mill is adjustable so you can have either fine or coarse pepper, and they seem to hold up just fine. I was a little apprehensive purchasing them after seeing that one reviewer said they rusted, but we haven't had any trouble with that. We live in Southern California where there isn't much humidity in the air, so maybe that's why we haven't had any issues."
3,not happy,These are way too large to place on any ordinary dining table. For kitchen use only. I dont like the salt shaker. The holes on it are tiny and salt does not come out easily through it. I like the peppermill though.
1,Rust & Corrosion,Loved this set when it arrived but in a little over a year they are covered with rust spots and the top of the salt shaker is very corroded. I'll be throwing them out soon.
5,Shakers.....So Nice!,I purchased this set of salt & pepper shakers for my newly remodeled kitchen. The stainless steel shakers fit in beautifully...modern & clean design. They hold a generous amount of spices and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The price was good and the quality even better than I expected. Happy to give my highest recommendation to these shakers. I'm sure anyone who purchases them will be pleased.
5,A very detailed look at an infuriating composer.,"The story of Bernard Herrmann does not begin and end with Hitchcock. It actually begins with Charles Ives and ends with Martin Scorcese. Along the way Orson Welles, Francios Trouffet, Brian DePalma, Sinbad, Gulliver, Rod Serling, and the ""It's Alive"" baby turn up. A biography of Bernard Herrmann tells the history of the use of music in radio, television, and film. It also tells the story of a brilliant, infuriating, and ultimately tragic figure. If you have an interest in film composing - real composing, not gathering 10 pop songs on a CD and calling it a soundtrack - you owe it to yourself to read this biography. And better yet would be to listen to some of his music while reading - the book vividly describes the music but hearing is believing."
2,Okay.....but worth it?,"THe shelf was everything I wanted, design and color wise. When I received the product itself I was a bit let down overall. It was easy to put together (pieces slide in to one another) but once you try to hang it up, if they are not fastened with superglue, they shift and fall apart. When I first got the shelf on the wall and tried to set my photos, plants on the shelf it shifted and eveything fell off. I used gorilla glue to hold the pieces together and now it's perfect. For the price it's not really worth the value but it looks nice."
2,fair,Found some defects in the wood and will not hang without glue.Overall slightly overpriced for quality and substance.
2,Not worth the high price,"I've been looking for a quality hanging shelf unit and this seem to fit the criteria. Expectations? Something with at least a little quality put into the construction and finished product. The wood is okay, the stain okay and the overall construction okay. It certainly isn't worth the price. Rather than good through the headache of returning it I did keep it and on the wall it looks fine."
4,best Gun Club cover band ever,"i saw these dudes rock out at SXSW 2003 on the GSL showcase. they own. the Gun Club and Pogues are obvious points of reference. The Starvations basically sound like the long lost early 80's LA roots rock punk band that you never heard of. X, The Blasters, The Flesh Eaters, Gun Club, The Zippers, and Los Lobos would all be proud that their legacy lives on in this band."
4,A nice selection of Thoreau's work. Not complete.,For the price the Kindle edition is fair. The issue I have with many of the 'active content' table of contents is that it does not show up when you click or select menu. Like many formatted books for the Kindle the actual...active table of contents can only be found if you select.... go to beginning....then you have to turn the page back....and then you will find the chapters. A little clunky but frankly for 99 cents I think I can live with it.
2,Good for the price,Thos collection is a good collection for the price I paid for it. The only problem with it is the table of contents doesn't have page numbers! So you basically have to just flip through the book until you find the essay or work you want to read. Timeless classic worth anyone's time however.
3,Good for the price,"I'm still reading this, but if you want a cheap way to read Thoreau, this is it. I have found many grammatical errors, probably when it was scanned into digital format, but for the price, what do you expect. As other raters indicated, I have yet to see an interactive table of contents, but again, for the price, it's still a great deal."
5,Casablanca,"We are going to Casablanca for 4 days while we spend the winter in Barcelona. I needed just the basic information, I already like Lonely Planet, and I got it from this book. Also in good condition for a used book."
4,One of the Better Morocco Guides,"Lonely Planet's newest Morocco Travel Guide does a nice job of condensing the best places to see in Morocco; it even outlines some of the better places to go trekking, such as Mgoun National Park. I live and work in Morocco with an eco-travel company and we recommend this particular guide on Amazon.com to those who want to research the country and places to see. From Fez to Marrakesh and even highlighting some places of interest in Western Sahara (seeAllah's Garden, a nonfiction account set in the region), Lonely Planet is unparalleled in their in-country research, facts, and even some off-the-beaten-path locales."
3,Give this game a chance.,"Some of you may or may not know that this is a 16-bit version of the same game release in the arcades in the early 90's. Trust me, I've played the arcade version years back. The game does have RPG elements but it's mostly a hack-n-slash 2-D side-scroller.Nintendo did a great job transfering this classic arcade game onto an 8-meg cartridge. The levels and bosses might be used more than once during the game but, its still addictive. There is a fair amount of replay value with a total of 50+ levels. Most of the levels though can be conqured in a matter of minutes but who cares. This is all just straight forward mindless fun. What do you expect from a super nintendo game that was made in 1992.Overall the game has excellent music and graphics. There is a wide variety of characters that can assist you and you get weapon upgrades once certain levels are cleared.If you have ever played King of Dragons or Knights of the Round than dont miss a chance to pick up this game."
4,Perfect recreation of this great car,"I'd bought it for may son because I loved seing SpeedRacer in my chilhood, the recreation is fantastic."
5,important,"This book is a little piece of gold.Heartfield was an amazing artist and a fine intellectual man.His works are impressive.A piece of history here, to wiew with a forefutere look."
4,"2 Player Fun, pure and simple","Capcom knew how to make great games and this one is no exception. Set in the world of King Arthur, you can control one of three knights (Arthur, Lancelot, and Percival), each with their different statistical traits.This game is more fun with two players. When you're playing by yourself, it's not quite as fun due to the difficulty level of the game. Nevertheless, a superb multiplayer game. Don't listen to the reviewer below that calls this a bad game. This one's a classic and a must-have for any Super NES library."
3,Better Than You Might Think,"Although written in flat pedestrian prose, the first half of this book is very enjoyable, as the son of the inventor of the original Time Machine seeks out his family history. The second half, when he travels through time, is pretty bad -- but even here memories of Wells's original novel and of scenes from the great 1960s movie add greatly to the text itself. All in all, a mediocre novel but a must-read for Time Machine fans"
1,Disappointingly written collector's item,"Over a decade ago I ran across this sequel to the H. G. Wells classic in a used book store. Authored by the famed film producer who directed the classic 1960 film version of the same novel, it is now apparently rare out-of-stock item; now I wish I had kept the book. But as novels go, it was terribly disappointing. I didn't expect it to meet the standard of H. G. Wells, but after reading the sequel, I reread the original. I was amazed at how far short the sequel fell in every conceivable aspect -- writing, plot, characterization, wit. This book might be a curious piece of cinematographic/science fiction history, but it truly doesn't deserve to be called a sequel to The Time Machine."
2,"Good, but not good enough","The laptop looks cool, and it is light enough to carry around for a long time. But I am very disappointed after I bought one and tried it. It generates too much heat too quickly compared to similar models from other vendors (e.g., IBM T41). In addition, I am not sure that SONY tested the port replicators thoroughly. The port replicators do not support fast Ethernet connection well. When you connect the replicator to a LCD monitor, you do not get video on the monitor when you play video files using real-player.I won't not buy any VAIO laptop computers in the future. It sucks!"
2,Mario's Missing Something,"What Mario is missing is all the action and exitment. It's not so action packed like super Mario world or other Mario games. All it was that I play the role of Luigi and select a door, go to an area, walk around, ask questions,go all over town,and princess is in it, but you just ask her questions. I'm glad it's not a movie,unlike the other Mario games, this one is ""BORING""!Alittle bit of advice, please I'm begging you, do not buy this one. Becuse I got so board, it gave me a headache."
1,the 2nd worst game ever,"This game is dum. All you do is go around looking for Mario.There's no action, no fun, no nothing. I can't beleive people bought this boring, pointless, and funless waste of money."
1,The Worst Mario Game In The World,Mario is Missing is the worst Mario game on the face of Earth.Nintendo shouldn't have given Software Toolworks the Mario license.Mario is Missing is a horrible crummy educational game that isn't really educational.
3,THE BEST GAME EVER,this game is the best if your not retared and can figure out a game its fun i suggest you buy this game
2,edutainment? I think not!,"this is one game that I was looking for... now that I've found it I think that it's one lame game. first of all, there's no challenge, second of all, most of the sprites are recycled from super mario world and finally, there's really not much to learn here, seeing as how the questions are really simple. so I do not recommend this game for anyone."
1,Worst Mario game ever.,"I fortunately rented this game for the good old SNES a couple of years ago, and it really surprised me in a very negative way.The positive thing is, that it is original in ertain way, because it is very different from previous Mario games, but that positive thing has translated in very boring gameplay.There's just no action, no nice side scrolling, you're just searching around in this game, but there just isn't any fun.This Mario game really misses the so called Nintendo magic, and besides that it's just plain boring, and frustating after some hours.Not only doesn't it feel like a real Mario game, this game also excels in nothing, it is not worth playing, and if you were ever considering buying this, I strongly recommend that you try it first so that you can see how much this game lacks fun."
1,Does not work,"This game does not work. Very disappointed because the ad said it had been tested and it worked but upon arrival, it won't play. Good thing it was inexpensive. Disappointed"
4,the outlaw,"Jane Russell--wow! Apparently the original negatives are not available, but if this is from a print, it's better than the last two or three I've purchased--and discarded. This is a keeper, until, and if, there's one from the original negative."
3,Interesting tribute from Mr. Hughes,You'll be a little taken aback with the soundtrack. Kinda reminds me of the Lucy show. But other than that it's a sophisticated tale for the time it was made. Jane looks a bit darker than we know her to be. It's better in black and white for that reason. I got this on a whim and I'm glad I did. If the orignal print can be found I wonder if it would benefit burning it to BD?
2,Short life,"Pepper mill worked fine for about 6 months than stopped grinding pepper.Seems to have stripped its gears or something. For almost $40 I expected it to last longer. Must be another ""made in China"" product??Revised.. I sent my non-working pepper mill back to Thompson and they sent me a brand new one that works great. The Thompson pepper mill has a lifetime warranty....if it stops working, send it to them for repair.I now would certainly recommend purchasing this product."
1,Pepper Mill,"Don't buy this item. It takes six batteries and they run down after three uses. Also, its hard to keep it together and sometimes its hard to take apart. Not recommended. Just use the good old fashioned pepper mill; hand twist!!"
4,it takes time,it takes some getting used to but this game is cool.pick a famous teamster from any basketball team across america.
4,Affordable Dalmation Halloween Costume,"The costume I bought for my 2 year old was adorable not to mention affordable. I would recommend this product to other moms and dads out there. I only have a very small complaint and that the fabric sheds. However, I should have washed before putting this outfit on."
2,Runs small,Cute costume but does run small. I read the other reviews and even contacted the manufacturer prior to ordering. They stated that the weight for the costume is 24-36 pounds My daughter will be three in 2 1/2 months weighting about 28 pounds and it JUST fits her (she is small for her age too). I'm glad that Halloween is soon or else she would not be able to wear it. I wish it was made in a larger size because it is tough to find a dalmatian costume that is made for a little girl.
2,mediocre and simplistic for adults,"The five star rating led me to order, but I would recommend looking elsewhere, unless you're a high school sophomore in need of some pointers for class. The suggested excercises are comically simplistic, and overall, the book was a disappointment."
3,Aimed towards beginning writers,"Judith Barrington's writing is engaging, but I was disappointed in the book. It spent much more time discussing basics of writing (""what's first person?"", present vs. past tense, etc.) than things particular to the memoir form.She references a lot of memoirs that I'd now like to read--and that's the best thing I can say about this book."
2,Good Technical Tips but Naysaying Tone,"Though I found her tips on memoir-writing techniques helpful, her overall tone was a bit discouraging. There was one part where she warned that one should always be ready to immediately capture on paper those moments of inspiration or risk losing that particular idea forever. I personally believe that one should have faith that any really important ideas will come up again and again. There were a lot of admonishments about the importance of doing things a certain way, and how hard it is to follow through and actually write a memoir. I may never get there, but I do feel that my own creative path is better served with more affirming books. It seems that this book is best suited for those wanting to write a ""literary"" memoir and is less geared for unconventional approaches."
3,Spiritualism and skepticism,"Very difficult to follow. Nevertheless, I read the entire book. I kept reading hoping to find ""where's the beef"". Never did. My suspicion is that the difficulty in reading the book is necessary in the eyes of the author in order to disguise what otherwise would be dismissed as nonsense. In a non-fiction book, that's dishonest. My conclusion: another huckster out to make a buck. If there were an honest message in the book, someone should re-write it with the aim of making it clear and simple. Spiritualism should not depend on obfuscation and other slight of hand."
2,His guitar is opaque,"The sound of Johnny's guitar, which is his signature, is not heard, the music background is not lucid."
4,20th century spiritualism,"This is Dr. Wickland's account of conversing with many ""spirits"" through his medium wife, with the last case cited taking place in 1922. The cases are presented in interview format, with relevant facts about the deceased, and to-the-point commentary. His approach owed more to psychology than religion, though he did comment on what he considered erroneous teachings. Whatever one may think of spiritualism, this is quite an interesting book, and the underlying assumptions about the afterlife have changed a lot in the decades since Wickland's sessions. 390 pages."
4,Interesting Book,"A great book for those who have an open mind! If the psychology field would read this book, perhaps they would see alternative ways to deal with problems."
5,"Excellent book, but note - this is actually UK book ""Blue Rondo""","The strange thing with the Inspector Troy books is that they get different titles when they're released in the US to when they originally come out in the UK. So, if you're from the UK and excited that to find a new Inspector Troy story you're sorely mistaken -- this book was originally called ""Blue Rondo"" and was first published in paperback in 2005. Why the title ""Blue Rondo"" is unsuitable for an American audience I don't know.But with that out of the way, ""Flesh Wounds""/""Blue Rondo"" is one of my favourites of the Troy books. Over time, we've got to love the characterisation, Police Surgeon Kolanciwicz is one of the foulest-mouthed people I've come across, but is hilarious to read, and Troy's attitude to most people seems to be that they can go and get lost.The best so far."
2,Love Miso Soup but not this,"I didn't find much in the way of the tofu bits that make many brands of miso soup interesting (yes I know they don't all contain that) and very little seaweed.. it was just this super dark murky watery stuff. Mine tasted strongly like smoke and a weird chemical taste. Bleh. We poured it out. To be fair I picked it up at a local supermarket, not here and it was not cheap."
5,"Melissa McClone's IF THE RING FITS, is a delight!","Take a prince, a clutz and a magic ring and you have the recipe for happily-ever-after. Christina Armstrong has always had everything that money can buy . . . and always longed for all the things it can't buy. She wants to live an ordinary life full of family and love. Ordinary will never be a word to describe Prince Richard de Thierry, but he does have one ordinary wish . . . that he be allowed to choose his own wife. But when a legendary ring ends up stuck on Christina's finger, Richard has to decide if he should follow the people's will, or follow his heart . . . or could it be that both will lead him the same place -- straight to Christina. IF THE RING FITS is the right read for anyone who loves fairytale stories of love that will leave you believing that happily-ever-afters do exist!"
3,Cheap sounding,"I was underwhelmed by how cheap sounding this tin whistle was. I am a long-time woodwind musician, and I guess you just get what you pay for."
2,Airy sound -- not worth it for actual playing,"I love wind instruments. I have a recorder that I taught myself to play, but I always loved the sound of the penny whistle, as it is deeply associated with my heritage. Gathering the gumption to teach myself another instrument, I ordered this.I have had two of these, the first I demanded a refund and new whistle for because no matter how I blew into it it sounded airy had a very poor quality tone. When I got my new whistle, I was excited to try it out again, only to find it makes the same, airy, untunable sound. Very disappointed. It is poorly made, and you can't even take it apart to tune it.The only thing that's worth anything about it is it's a pretty green, and it came with a little bit of sheet music. Besides that, it's pretty much worthless as an instrument. I'll probably let my kids use it as a toy and get a real penny whistle for myself."
3,Funny Flute,"Considering this was my first irish tin whistle, I really just bought it for its looks. I didn't know what to expect. The instrument plays well but after a few months I received a Feadog Tin whistle from a friend that sounded much better. Its a beautiful flute though, came on time, and in great condition."
3,Not as good as one I owned before,"This tin whistle is very pretty. There is a rough edge on the plastic mouthpiece that could have been finished off better. It plays all right, but does not have the sweet tone and is harder to blow continuously than one I used to own, which I don't believe was a Clarke. On the other hand, I used to have another one without a plastic mouthpiece that played like this, so maybe it is just a style. It has a very breathy, airy quality."
5,Fun and easy to play,"I just got this and it is very easy to play and sounds nice. To help me learn how to play well, I also bought and recommend ""The Clarke Tin Whistle: Deluxe Edition (Book & CD)"". The 2-page instructions that came with the whistle did not suffice to learn how to play."
3,Not as good as others say,"The tin whistle is my fifth instrument, so although I am new to the whistle I know something about music. After reading the great reviews of this whistle I bought one. I wasn't at all happy with the tone so I went into some whistle forums and read about the Dixon Trad whistle. I purchased one of those and am much happier with it. Yes, it's 3 times the cost ($29), but well worth the difference."
4,Perfect beginning Whistle,"Aloha from Kaua'i!I just received this whistle and one other for Christmas this year and am in musical heaven! I have always wanted one of these instruments. This one with it's plastic Fipple tends to be fairly loud and easy to play making it ideal as a first tin whistle(You don't have to blow quite as hard as with a wooden fipple). I do fell that this lacks the warmth that the wooden fipple whistle has, but that is more of a personal choice. I do highly recommend this one for anyone interested in playing the Tin Whistle! It is very hard to put down! :) Mahalo nui loa Clarke!"
4,Great for beginners,I'm new to the tin whistle. This product was shipped promptly and arrived as described by the seller. I am pleased with the overall tone and ease of play. The fingering chart that came with it is effective for learning and there are many web sites with sheet music for you to use.
2,Comparing to the Wooden Stop,"I bought this one as a gift for a friend, and it was green as pictured. I will call it ""Green"" from now on.I own the Clarke Original which is black. I will call it ""Black"".Trying out both whistles, I much prefer Green. The mouthpiece is far superior. If you are familiar with Oak whistles, the mouthpiece is very similar - smooth, rounded plastic that feels and sounds fantastic. Black is simply a tin shaft with a wooden stop for the mouthpiece. I...hate it haha! It sounds incredibly airy and is very difficult to clear moisture out of.Other than the mouthpiece, Black and Green are identical whistles. Comparing to other whistles I own (aluminum, plastic bodies), I can say that Clarke's don't get very loud, sound airy, and can be somewhat annoying. The conical shaft feels pretty comfortable, but there is a seam. I would rather have a straight aluminum body.In all, I would chose Oak or Genaration over Clarke, but Green over Black if you gotta have the Clarke."
4,Tin Whistle - D,My 12-year enjoys playing the flute. The tin whistle has been a lot of fun playing songs from the Titanic as well as many other classics.Thank you!
4,Takes Some Practice...,"I ordered this tin whistle just for the halibut one day. I have a friend who plays the tin whistle very well, and the instrument sounds wonderful, so I figured I'd give it a shot.Now, when my tin whistle arrived, it was not the same one as in the picture. It was still a Clarke Sweetone, but it was blue rather than green. This didn't bother me much; it still worked the same.I do have to point out that it does take some practice to get a really good tune out of it. Without practice, it sounds a bit obnoctious and squeaky, like a recorder. You just have to control your flow of breath, and you get a wonderful tune.It is really a very easy instrument to learn, though. Within the first day I purchased it, I was able to play a very nice rendition of ""Going Home"" from ""The New World"".Overall, if you have the patience to practice air flow and tone, this is a wonderful instrument, very easy to play and excellent for the price."
5,Love Them!,"I love the pepper grinder because it comes out perfect, not like the others all chunky pepperI love the salt because its not a grinder. And they totally look like glass but are plastic so when they get dropped there ok :)"
1,Only buy this if you are a professional painter!,"This book is great if you already know how to paint and only want to paint exactly what they have: an old lunch box, and even older T.V., a sink, a couple of swings, a table, a gourd, a brick, etc. They give you the pattern (in most cases) but do not give you any tips on how to actually paint. I was expecting more general ideas on how to paint household items like frames, vases, candleholders, etc... If you are thinking about buying this book, I would check it out in the library first and see if it is for you!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I purchased a plumeria anklet in silver from a local vendor and since they do not carry a matching bracelet, I ordered this one hoping that it would be a good match for the anklet that I have. The price was comparable and the picture online seemed close enough. However, the delivered product is much too shiny and 'cheap' looking. I will upload a photo as soon as I am able.NOTE: This particular bracelet may be enjoyed by others, it just did not meet my needs."
5,Awesome......,"I don't usualy give things 5 stars. Most of the Video Games I play or the Movies I watch may be 5 star movies but I usualy find a problem with it anyway. Not here! Lufia is something interesting and wonderful. It has graphics that are poor and a battle system that leaves something to be desired. Sounds bad does it not. But then you have the music... bect music for a game (except for FF VI) ever. And the story was very good, so much so that I wanted to play the game again and hope that the outcome would differ. The two good aspects make what would be an otherwise boring game a wonderful masterpeice.Graphics--- 5/10Play Control 8/10Battle Style 3/10Story 9/10Music 10/10Chalenge 8/10Replay 8/10Draws you into the game factor 12/10Have fun and Cinnimon Tea!"
2,A stereotypical RPG clone,"Lufia is another RPG, where you start off a lone warrior setting out to destroy a powerful monster who is terrorizing the world with his monster mideons. Along the way, you find two other warriors to join you on your quest, one powerful and the other a magician. The graphics to this are nothing to talk about, nor is the gameplay, and all of the equipment and items are just taken from Final Fantasy games. The huge downfall of the game, is that you can fall into predicaments where you need to restart the whole game, such as traps, where you need to have an item to escape, and this item may be somethin you missed early in the game. There is pretty fair challenge and it will take you a month to beat. Nothing new here."
2,Power Inverter,I bought it which I thought it would work for our needs and it didnt so I gave to other friendI do not know if the friend like it or not
5,Great book for all ages!,This book is wonderful! I bought it for my 3 year old son. It has tons of pictures! I would recommend this for children of all ages.
2,Reverse version of Lemmings that wasn't nearly as good,"Krusty's Fun House is a reverse Lemmings. Instead of saving the rats, you kill them to rid your Fun House of all these nasty rats.Honestly, I didn't like this one because it wasn't as gradual as Lemmings or even progressive at that. What I noticed when I played this game is that the first few boards are real easy and then suddenly, it shifts to brutally hard! Not cool. That and after you get past maybe one or two real hard boards, it goes back to being way too easy.Krusty's Fun House is a sleeper. It got real boring real quick. Plus when it all came down to it, it was the same board over or and over again with just a few shifts of obstacles and a background change, but still it was the same level.I think Lemmings would be a better buy because it's more challenging and a lot funnier."
5,Go Kelly,"This is great. It is delightful to find a book about a girl that does something. Like Mia in the Princess Diaries, Kelly grows and changes. This book is really two stories in one; Kelly in Oklahoma and the Moon Princess in Diamond Land. The fantasy portion is just right, dolphins, dragons, and of course someone evil to overcome, the real world is similar, but the demon is within. I loved seeing a strong young girl able to take responsibility for herself and affect changes in her life."
1,Horrible,This book is poorly done...do not be fooled by the good reviews that are continually posted by the author for his own work. One cannot possibley learn Thai from this...it is merely a bunch of phrases used by sex tourists.
4,Likers Lovers Daters and Men,"Interestingly enough this book is for men (big surprise). It has language brooken down and small paragraphs that explain different parts of the Thai courting ritual. Though I believe it needs more information on the way Thais act, and more information for the female farang it still rates high in my growing stack of Thai books."
1,Not a good dictionary and even worse tapes,"I bought the books and the tapes. In the book there is no index, there is no word for word translation so one knows what words mean. Just a bunch of phrases with a hopefully accurate translation - though from what I've read here that may be suspect. Meanwhile the tapes are spoken in rapid fire Thai and there is no chance to learn the pronunciation. Overall this is a poor effort."
1,An insult to Thai People,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer who says that this is phrase book is an insult to Thai people. Thailand is a country rich in culture and beauty, and its people are warm and hospitable. Yes, the country has prostitution, but this book is only of use to people so desperate and sick that they have to travel halfway around the world to find paid for companionship."
2,Would not trust with important stuff,"Recently purchased for a trip to the Cayman Islands. Haven't had a chance to actually use the pouch but the sealing mechanism seems sketchy at best. It consists of double-folding the top of the bag and sealing it with velcro, yes velcro.I tested the pouch by putting some paper in it and left in a tub of water for a few hours while also occasionally bending/folding and agitating the bag to simulate real world snorkeling/diving conditions. After removal the inside of the bag was slightly damp and had let in more than just a few droplets of water, but not much more. Still good for keeping most things relatively dry but if its anything important/electronic, i would not trust it in this pouch."
4,"Holdsworth collection incomplete without ""Velvet Darkness""","This is not the usual Holdsworth recording. I understand that Allan himself dislikes it. The recording is terrible. It's short. The other musicians are good, but the sound is dated (which bothers me not a bit). The songs on ""Velvet Darkness"" are colorful and rhythmically complex with a punchy early seventies fusion sound. Allan sounds great, if not quite as clean as he sounds today. What makes this one really special are the three acoustic guitar solos he plays. Its well worth checking out for those alone. I bought it on vinyl in the mid eighties and quickly transferred it to cassette so I wouldn't wear it out."
3,For the Curious,"This is a recording of a rehearsal that was published as an album without the permission of the artist. Allan has stated this many times. As such the performance and mix were never intended to be okay for publication.If you're looking for another brilliant album by Allan, then this may disappoint. If you're trying to get better perspective on the evolution of his playing, then this album is a good choice.The guitar sound is much raspier and raw than any other recording by Allan (that I've had the chance to hear.) The mix is raw. The composition is raw. Does any of this translate to the good kind of raw? Like, say, Mahavishu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame? Perhaps.The thing to try to understand while hearing this is that Allan was trying to do something great in conditions that were terrible.Worth owning if you're curious. Allan despises this record's existence-- for good reason-- and receives nothing from its sales."
3,Just another Tulla lbum for me. It's not bad at all.,"Got only two Tull albums: AQUALUNG and, now, this one here. I found it very good to listen (nowadays, anything from an expert band from the past is better than most of the bad music that people are releasing..) This album has good music, altough Tull is not my favorite band anyway, never will be. After a time Anderson's vocals and flute playing became so repetitive and boring."
2,Too old to listen...,"This is a bring TUll album, full of acustic guitars. Also, Anderson's voice is almost unbearable here."
3,"Good Game, Bad Mouse","My older sister got this game when it came out in 1992, when I wasn't even a year old. It's original, fun, but I hate the Super NES mouse, that you have to use! It comes with a pad that you scroll it on, but I lost that 4 years ago. No I have to use notepads, dictionaries... Ahhhhhhh!!! So I gave it to my younger sister when we plugged up our secod Super NES in her room. Yet, it's still a fun game where you draw using an alive brush with a face, arms, and legs. There are a couple of mini-games also. In one of them you can your own song using Mario heads, baby Yoshis, Mushrooms, Starmen, and lots of other items, once you finish Mario plays it. This is called Paino Keys. The other one is called Coffee Break, where you use the mouse as a fly swatter and you try to get hit flies, bees, wasp, Bob-Omb spiders, and then a huge robotic grey wasp with every attack and you have to hit it like 8 to 18 times depending on what level your on (there are 3 levels). Overall it's a medium game."
3,oh man ugh omg,"....its probably not your fault but i completely forgot that this requires a mouse man, bought the game plugged it up could not play cant even get a mouse becauseit isnt compatible with the type of system i have...it hurts that i got it and cant enjoy the game"
1,poor,"will never order from them again!!!! i was not pleased with this product. when i looked it up the seller told me that it was like new. when i got it the game had food in it, and there was no mouse to be able to play it. so i have not even played the game. worst experience i have had yet."
2,What is This?,"I bought this CD because I love the songs that are on here. So anywayz, I pop this CD in and start singing, and then I here these background singers. They are beyond awful. The music doesn't even sound that much alike either. I would not purchase this CD if I were you."
3,SJ,"I have been using the bag for about 3 weeks now on a daily basis. Its a pretty nice thing if you need carry a 15.4"" computer along with few files.The padding is not the best but adequate and the looks are pretty contemporary and plain.Not a bad buy for under 30$."
4,great deal,great deal on a great brand of backpack. would like it more if it had a bit more space. no complaints though it is very sturdy and well made.
2,Not satisfactory,"I have seen it on web it looks good but when I opened it, wasn't that much looking good like the look and feel is not satisfactory for me !"
3,Poor laptop backpack,"For a backpack you can buy it, but for a laptop backpack not good, not enough padding to protect laptop. I returned it as soon as I received, Sorry."
3,bad zipper,"Great backpack, but the zipper broke. I went for another Targus backpack with a more durable zipper. Seriously, couldn't they include a durable zipper in every model? You get what you pay for."
4,"Useful, well-crafted, many nice features, but a bit ugly","As most others have mentioned, this bag is a really solid value for the $. Its nylon fabric is thick and tough, the bottom panel is waterproof and even more rugged, it has pockets galore with extremely well thought-out little storage nooks everywhere (even on the sides), the straps are comfortable, sturdy, and well attached to the body of the bag, the laptop compartment is decently padded, and it is overall a 5 star bag except for one minor thing - it's rather homely. I'm far from a fashion plate, but even I think this bag could use a little sprucing up in the colors and logo department. That being said, I'd recommend it in a second to anyone. Plus, it fits my widescreen Dell Inspiron 6000 very well - not too snug, not too loose. A real winner in the laptop backpack segment."
2,just cheap,laptop compartment offers no protection. They should not market this as a laptop backpack.waste of money
3,Low price but low amount of padding to protect laptop.,Low price but low amount of padding to protect laptop. My son is ok with it but I'm concerned about his computer.
4,Excellent Product,"I am satisfied by the purchase of this Targus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpack since it is super wide, comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects apart of the laptop. I recommend it to you."
4,"Great bag, just wish it had a little more space","This is a great, well constructed bag. My 17"" laptop does fit into the bag, but it is a pretty snug fit. I love Targus bags and really like the slim profile on this bag, but I wish it had just a little bit more room."
3,"A good backpack, not great.","This is a standard looking and functioning backpack, nothing special to report here. Has good space for a 17"" or lower laptop but the material is cheap and wears out quickly."
5,great bag,"supportive for large laptops, can store many things with you too. good construction and light weight. was some smell but that faded fast once it was out of the plastic bag."
5,"Great bag, Great price! Definitely worth the money","I got this bag a few weeks ago as a PhD student to lug books and a laptop around. The picture is a poor example of the bag, it looks good, has a ton of pockets and is very very comfortable to wear and use. I would highly reccomend this bag to others, for less than $25.00 to my door, I have no complaints."
3,Good Bag but...,They sent me the bag in a box too big! and I live in venezuela and tube to pay 100 dollars for shipping a bag that cost me 20 dollars. But if the bag is quite nice and comfortable. Very good bag.
4,"Kindof Dorky, but oh so functional...","Have a 13"" Mac with no case. Going to Crete for work so needed something. Ordered this. Pleasantly surprised at the (good) quality. Holds computer wonderfully. Also big enough to cram lots of other junk (even clothes). A great travel item for computer. Just remember, the more stuff you load into it, the more it sticks out from you back and you know what that means.... DORKY! Especially when you double-strap. Oh well...."
5,Im real happy !,Im real happy with this product. Its a masterpiece compared to the price I got it for. Highly recommended.
5,Husband's xmas present for his new lap top,"My husband has had this back pack for about a yer now and it is holding up very well! He uses it for almost everything, and likes all of the compartmens/pockets it has for things like his mouse, and mobile speakers."
5,Inexpensive with Good quality,I am trying to be quite picky on what I buy and I am satisfied with this purchase. The backpack is comfortable on the back and shoulders even with tons of books in it. And the design is practicle and careful to protect your notebook. I feel lucky to buy such a good product at such a low price.
5,"Good value, tough material, tons of space.","This backpack is a good value. The material is tough, there is a lot of space with many, many pockets, and the design and construction is overall excellent. There are other backpacks which will do a better job of protecting your laptop, but they come at a price.Unless you're hard on your equipment, this is a good choice for a backpack."
1,Is this for real?,"It's hard to believe this is from Targus because they usually make pretty good products. This one though is not one of them. I bought a laptop backpack to protect my laptop. I expect some padding,there is none! This could pass as a regular backpack. I was so excited when I thought I was getting a good deal for a laptop backpack and became so mad when I finally saw what I actually got! Spend the extra 30 bucks and get a good quality bag."
3,"Maybe I got a ""lemon""...","Really surprised to see so many high ratings for this bag. I've had mine for about 1.5 years and it has already begun to deteriorate quite a bit -- small holes worn in the bottom corners, and threads fraying here and there. (I use it on a daily basis simply lugging my laptop around for work). Being a bit picky I suppose, but after having had Jansport bags last 15+ years, I'm a little put off by this bag starting to break down in under 2 years. But hey, that Jansport bag (which I still own) was made back before everything was shipped out to low cost labor manufacturing. And those days are loooooong gone. I'm getting used to paying more for crappier goods..."
3,a Good buy for the price it is available for,"Got the bag bout a fortnight ago now, looks cool in the color black, they send me in. specially when not stuffed up like the one in the pic, if ur laptop is 15.4 inches or bout that no is a good buy.Rest is easy as a backpack, good cushion, keep the laptop intact and doesnt shake once buckled up properly. has lots of pockets outside but has a inner sack division too for putting stuffOverall a good buy for the price offered"
4,review for a best company and best quality,this is best quality and it is comfortable.it also has many compartments where u can keep different things in different compartments.............
3,My backpack,"Its a good quality backpack and has convenient compartments. the only thing is that my computer is a bit loose in the pocket and its not a as padded as I would like. Also the computer is at the back where when you lay it down the books are on the computer, i think they should have the section for the computer at the front"
5,Great value for money,I am glad I bought this backpack. It exceeded all my expectations. I strongly recommend this one!
3,Good bargain,I bought the bag at very low price and have been using it everyday for past 8 months. The bag is good and very useful.Pros:1. Many pockets to keep things.2. Laptop 15.3 inches fits perfectly.3. Strong build.Cons:1. Not water proof. Can sustain light rainfall.
4,Targus PC/School Backpack,"I have been using this backpack for about a month now and seems to be great. I carry a laptop,a couple of books, a couple of movies and all the class and computer supplies I need for school. There is sufficient room throughout the backpack. With all of the stuff I carry, I still have room to put more stuff inside. The bottom of the backpack has some padding for the laptop, so do not drop your laptop from to far above."
4,Great for college,"I got this bag for my laptop for college and I love it. It is a really great bag with lots of room for the laptop plus other school items. I easily fit the laptop, notebooks and textbook in the bag. It is a very comfortable bag with nice shoulder straps that fit well and don't hurt. All in all I am very pleased with it."
4,Great for my Purposes,"I'm not on the road all the time, but I travel 20-40 times year, and this has kept up very well for the several months that I've had it. It's large enough to fit my laptop, a large hardback book, notebook, pens, GPS, Blackberry, iPod, iPhone, headphones, change, an RF toll pass, travel wallet, and any other sundry items I decide to take with me on any particular trip. It's inexpensive and I've had zero problems with it. It could use additional padding on the shoulder straps, but that would be more of a ""delighter"" than a requirement - I'm not taking day hikes with it. The side webbing could also stand to be a bit deeper and larger so it would more comfortably fit a 20-oz drink, but other than that, it's a great backpack. Overall, I've been very pleased with this backpack."
2,had it 2 weeks and it is falling apart,I thought after reading the reviews I would give it a chance but I was wrong. not only does it seem like it was made cheaply the bag is fraying in 3 different places and all I have done with it is use it as a carry on for 3 flights. I loved the colors but it just can;t stand up to being used.
3,Ok for the price,This bag is ok for the price.. a basic laptop book bag. doesnt give much space for books once the laptop is in. I recently got the swiss army bag and found that much for spacious and comfortable.
5,Excellent Backpack,"Light, secure and fine construction.Targus is a excellent mark, I recommend this products."
4,Good laptop backpack,"This is a good backpack, the only complaint I can think of is that I have a wide neck and the straps rub on either side of my neck. I do not think this is an issue for most people however."
5,great backpack,"The quality is very good. The padding is thick enough to protect the laptop. It works for both 14"" and 15.4"" wide screen laptops. It has several layers and pockets so it is easy to arrange different items."
4,Good one !,While buying I was a bit hesitant but now I'm quite sure that I didn't make a mistake :-)
4,Good solid computer bag,"This is ideal for my commute. I work in downtown Chicago and have to walk several blocks to & from the train. It's a lot less stressful than carrying a shoulder bag. It has enough compartments that are easily accessible and it even stands up when you set it down--you don't have to worry about it tipping over. Finally, the handle on top is convenient too. Overall, very functional and a good value for the money."
5,Excellent Bag,I had gone through the reviews and based on that i placed my order.. when i received my Bag...it was the same as others expericed..it is awsome good & the value for the money..i just luve the bag..u too experince this
2,Product misrepresentation is never cool,"Product misrepresentation is never coolThe backpack works alright, but they sold advertising space on the back. there is a stitched on patch with five different company logos that have nothing to do with making backpacks. I was very disappointed in this seeing as how it was not mentioned in the product description."
5,Worth Purchase,"A descent backpack which suits my Sony 15.4"" screen laptop with a very reasonable price. I bet you can get such a branded item in this price, since I have reviewed and searched a lot for this item before purchase."
5,Excellent,"The quality of the purse and the capacity of he himself surpassed my expectations, is difficult to let use it."
4,Great Bag,I bought this bag to carry my lap top and books and it does a great job f it. it is very comfortable and my only complaint is that the waist strap is set pretty high. I am 6ft tall though so maybe that is the problem but for the price I cant complain.
2,OK (only),"Only OK, very lightweight material, and not all that versatile. Collapses easily if you are trying to get books, folders etc in and out. There are better backpacks out there."
4,Good laptop backpack,"I bought this to replace a laptop bag that was a pain to carry around. It does its job well, as it is so much easier to carry a laptop in a backpack. It has space for all the computer cords and peripherals. I wish it provided more pocket space. With the laptop in, I can put a writing pad of regular size, but it is difficult to take in and out because there is no dedicated pocket for paper and it gets stuck on the mesh inside of one of the pockets. But overall I am happy with the product - it does what it is supposed to do."
2,Not what it looks like in the picture,"It is very thin. I thought it has a thick protection for computers, no. It is not worth the money."
2,Cheap Backpack,"I should have realized it when I saw the price. The bag looks sorta good in the picture, but is a poorly made product. You will see many pockets in the pic but the bag lacks the quality to support a fully loaded one.If you plan to carry lightweight items around, this bag can be useful. But if you are a college student who wants to lug laptop, books and heavy items, don't waste your money on this."
5,Targus Notebook Backpack,This is an excellent price for value. It has lots of storage and made from quality material.
3,it is good,"it is good and it is light. I take it everyday. if you want a light backpack and you have no heavy things to take, it is good. and it works well with my laptop."
2,User Review,"Good color and design blend. However, poor build quality for a laptop bag. A lot of loose thread around the zip areas and material strength is low."
4,"good buy, some cons","I really like the bagPros:Very light wt,Lots of spaceDurableVery good buy for the priceCons:The side pocket zippers run the wrong way. The current placement does not allow me to put anything taller than the pocket size (like a water bottle) without it falling out ( zice I cannot partially zip it in.Ditto for the front pocket: since the puller is on the wrong side, its inconvenient to take out things when I have it slung on one (right)shoulder. For left handed people it should be fine though."
4,Check the size carefully,"Alas, I didn't check the size and my 17 inch laptop doesn't fit. I gave it to my nephew. The quality looks good, it arrived promptly, and price was great."
1,"Sub-standard backpack from a ""reputable"" maker","Poor quality. Several seams ripped on the first trip. A sub-standard product from Targus which should care more about its reputation. Design is good but poor quality materials and even poorer-quality manufacturering make this a backpack to avoid. If you want Targus, buy a better one. If you want something at the low end of the price range, don't buy this one."
4,Great backpack!,I purchased this to actually carry my tools in for work and I love it. It's sturdy and has lots of compartments. I plan to purchase a second one for my laptop and school books.
2,You get what you pay for...,"It's a cheap backpack and you get exactly that. I do not reccomend this backpack for those who have a good chance of getting caught in the rain and use it to carry your textbooks and laptop. This thing is not waterproof! Sure, the bottom is, and all the good that does, it just keeps the water in at the bottom of the bag so the water pools. Because of this I've had several textbooks ruined because of the water pooling at the bottom. Imagine if I had a laptop in at that time...it would of been waterlogged and fried."
3,Great BUT....,"I have had this backpack for a little less than a year. I have been very happy with it. It is very versatile, has a lot of room for many things and it's inexpensive. The only problem I've had is with the zippers. They are not heavy duty and tend to separate a lot. This has been going on for about 3-4 weeks now and I'm not over filling it, not at all.Other than that it's a great buy for the price, but I won't return to it, a backpack zipper should last and take on way more than that."
5,"Soo much padding, yet so small and compact.","Its amazing.I agree with the other reviews, the picture in the products page does NOT do this products justice.There's much more padding than pictured and the overall appearance is spectacular.The specialized laptop slot has a strap that secures the laptop from the top, and the slot itself is more like a huge pocket with its own padding inside the zipped slot which is also padded. I could fit my 17.3"" dell xps (which is just a hair smaller than any gaming laptop) with ease. Theoretically, if you dont use the laptop pocket, and just use the zipped component, you could fit a 18 in alienware in there fine. So that leads to me say that this backpack will fit and protect ANY laptop or netbook just fine.Lastly, the various pockets, pencil holders, and slots are all very solid.I was able to fit my samsung vibrant in the pda pocket with the 3.5mm jack showing.Definitely the best backpack I've ever owned."
5,Nice laptop bag,"I have been using this bag for almost 8 months now. It is worth the money. It holds 15.4"" laptop and my books. Water proof would have been a plus, nevertheless it is good bag."
5,great,"bag is very good. padding for laptop is very thick and safe. even the bottom is slightly padded.looks better than shown in the picture. good design of shoulder straps, feels lighter than my old bag with same load, i definitely feel it is due to the strap design. I would highly recommend this item the ""cvr600"""
5,Excellent Quality,"The bag is of excellent quality. Some people in the review complained about the thinness of padding. I found that it is sufficient and protects the notebook from bumps. However, it wouldnt if you start throwing the bag around. I took Free shipping to save some money. It was delivered in 5 days. Hence, one of the best deals I have had in Amazon."
3,Great quality but a wee bit small,"The make of this backpack is quite high so I know it won't disentegrate like my last one. The description oversells the space however. I use it for carrying my laptop and papers/files back and forth from the office and on travel. The space for files is too narrow so you can't place files into those pockets, instead you wind up carrying files within the main compartment, which defeats the purpose of the filing space. Otherwise good backpack."
3,"Not really big enough for a 17"" gaming laptop","I have a large laptop for gaming and even though it has a 17"" screen, it will not fit into the area designed to hold the laptop in the bag. The straps seen to be fairly heavy duty and sewn into the bag strong, but the bag itself is pretty thin with the exception of where your back goes up against, which is somewhat padded.This is much more of a regular backpack than anything made to house a laptop and I see no reason to choose it over a regular bag with a few divided pockets."
4,Good backpack,"Good backpack for the money. I've used Targus backpacks that seem to be able to carry more, even including a laptop. Seems like this one would not be that great for carrying a lot of stuff except for a laptop and maybe some thin paper files, power supply, one or two plastic bottled drinks, etc. Then again, that's not really the point of a laptop backpack. Targus is a solid company and they stand behind their products. I'd get this one again."
3,Not so impressed..,This backpack is not attractive but it serves the purpose of carrying a laptop. I put my 15 inch Macbook in a sleeve case and then into this bag. It fits well. After keeping a laptop there is not much space left. It doesn't have many pockets as I would like. That's why I am giving it 3 stars.
5,This inspired Chris Carter to produce the X-Files,"These two made-for-TV movies set the standard for really good, scary television. I'd suggest getting the whole series. Darren McGavin was great in this series and it sadly ended too soon."
4,A must see,This movie stands up to current films. The acting is good. The make up is not cheesy. Just a good film.
3,incorrect info,the item is descibed by amazon as being 2 disc this is not correct it is a single disc front and back
3,Does not age gracefully,I LOVED these shows as a kid. Scared the crap out of me. 30 years later they are likea bad Love Boat episode with former film stars appearing in bad cameos.Perhaps your 8 year old needs something to see....
4,A Must Own Classic !,"Darren McGavin has always been 1 of my favorite Actors so when they made The Night Stalker series featuring him, they had my vote. The Pilot episode 'The Night Stalker' is already a classic but along with 'The Night Strangler' who features Richard Anderson, A Movie that has both of the OSI leader's from TV's 'The Six Million Dollar Man', McGavin(The Pilot) & Anderson(The Series), These two give a great performance of good vs evil..."
5,rotti,Loved this series growing up. I was happy to get this series in excellent condition. We take this with us when we go camping on one of those rainy days.
3,A walk down a (scary) memory lane,"The memories of 70's ""Movies of the Week"" come flooding back when watching these DVD's. The original ""Night Stalker"" movie was terrific at the time and still good stuff right now - amazing how a good story can make for a good movie rather than depending on high-tech special effects to bring in the audience. The ""Night Strangler"" was a decent psuedo-sequel - like how it showed off the Seattle underground, something not readily aware to many. Quality of both recordings is not great but still loads of fun watching these - recommended for the Kolchak fans out there."
3,Carl Kolchak Cools Count,"I hadn't seen the original TV film 'The Night Stalker' for some years, now, and it, logically, dates a bit. However, I was surprised on how it did keep my interest, had some decent acting, and was actually a little spooky at times(although not much). This is definitely not the scariest horror film, ever, but it's fun to go back to the early years of TV movies(they were really starting to move by this time) and see one of the better ones from that era. Darren McGavin is what really makes this one work. His passing last year is really our loss(have you ever seen 'The Christmas Story'?) I caught some of the episodes of the spinoff TV series in the early years of the SCI FI Channel-they're not too good. However, it'd be kind of fun to go back and check them out. There was only one season, so the recently released season is it."
5,"Excellent Intro on the great heroine,but...","This is a generally well done documentary on the great heroine Hanna Senesh;however it's missing one important piece regarding Hungarian Jewish collaborater Dr. Rudolph Kastner -assassinated in Israel in '57,following a libel/Nazi collaboration trial and his relationship to Sennesh.Recent projects revised Kastner into a hero, who saved Jews are put on trial in the late great Ben Hecht's 'Perfidy'(Co. 1961,pp.118-);Hanna's mother testified that Kastner refused to meet with her.Hanna's fellow parachutists Joel Palgi and Peretz Goldstein met their former ""mentor"" in the Zionist Youth Movement of Kluj,Hungary(Perfidy p.124-125).Palgi and Goldstein took Kastner's advice and turned themselves in;both were tortured-and put on a train.Palgi escaped and made it into the documentary...this along with jazz singer Sophie Milman's take onHanna Senesh's 'Eli,Eli' from her 'Make Someone Happy' cd...then hopefully anAcademy Award for a Hanna Senesh movie."
2,Flimsy case feel,"I cannot really compare this Libelle Leather Quad to any other pen case as this is my first one. After opening this thing up, I was disappointed considering that this cost over $30. Is this really leather? When I turned the flap up, it felt like styrofoam. The texture/feel didn't show quality that it was going to last if I tossed this in the bag. Around the case edges, it has the ""hiding glue"" to prevent users from seeing the leather from the side. It reminded me of my old phone case which in less than a year started peeling away. As for the stitching, it is thin. The flat exposed backside where it can rub against surfaces like a book or desk: Could this back stitch wear out faster? I am worried but time will tell.I will hold onto this as long as I can although I am not impressed on the quality up front. Right now my gut tells me this is not worth it because of what I listed above in my inspection."
4,Lund Tonneau cover,"Product seems to be made from good quality materials. The lowest cost cover I found, for a new cover. I like the locking feature as well as the easy roll up feature.Installation was fairly easy, however the instructions could use some better pictures, to make it easier to follow."
2,Not for younger player-hard to maneuver,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who is an excellent reader. This game requires a lot of reading and patience. I as a parent play all my kids GBA games, and this one was a bit challenging for me. The directions are somewhat clear, and the mini games are hard to maneuver. I think the game should have less reading, and easier to understand intructions. It was a disappointment."
3,she hates it!,This game got her so lost she just chucked it to the side for life! Its confusing but hey shes 30 so it's not her vibe!
2,"Well, I guess it's okay...","I recieved this game last year for Christmas, and I was really excited. I got to I think it was Level 3, and I had to do this one thing with Cameron {skating on his skateboard}, and everytime I passed it, it would always say on the task list to invite Cameron to a trip to London.I was very upset, because I played the same level at least 10 times, and it still wouldn't work. My mom told me that maybe I wasn't doing it right, but I was.I still have the game, and sometimes try to pass the level, but I can't.I hope none of you have the same issue."
1,Horrible,"My husband spent a long time putting this thing together with the ShelterLogic 12x20 feet Canopy Enclosure Kit, and unfortunately it didn't last more than a week before the whole thing blew apart. Would not recommend unless you have winds of less than 5mph.However, Amazon was AMAZING about the return. Best customer service we've ever experienced!"
1,Bad usage of time!,This video has a long introduction and commercials. Commericials at the beginning and the end. There is a lot of wasted time. I found it an extremely inefficient use of my time--I am returning it today!
5,"Really good, really fast","I read alot of the reviews on this DVD and had to add my 10 cents. It's a really great, very diverse abs workout. I seriously hurt in areas of my abs I had forgotten I had the first couple times. I do Pilates and Yoga classes regularly but this is intense (if you'll follow along) and quick. I guess if you can already bounce a dime off your abs, it may not be challenging enough, but for Suzi Citizen who is doing her best to be fit and look great in (and out of) her jeans, this DVD rocks."
2,average,"This is a good video for ab workout basics. Not great if you aren't a beginner. It requires a lot of equipment, too."
2,Definitely for Beginners,"I agree with another reviewer that there were not enough reps on any of the workouts to really feel like I got a workout. The exercises themselves were good, but not for the more advanced exerciser. I will look elsewhere for an awesome abs workout. There is a Stability Ball Abs segment on Kathe Friedrich's Basic Step DVD that is awesome. I would also reccommend the abs segment on Tamilee Webb's Tight on Time DVD."
5,A must Ab workout!,"I love this dvd. I viewed it on my netflix, and soon after I decided I had to buy it. I went everywhere (best buy, walmart, circuit city) and couldn't find it. I bought it here on Amazon and I got it today. I am an intermediate/low-advance exerciser, and this workout beat me. I felt ""good pain"" during the pilates workout! I love the ab ball workout! I love this dvd, and I will be doing this 3-4 times a week. I have been exercising for nearly 3 years now, and I haven't been able to achieve a flat stomach so I decided to give this a try.I have a small tummy but nothing close to Violet's abs! I want her abs, and I am committed to doing this video 3-4 times a week.Everyone should go get this...very fun, fast workout. Not boring at all. I love it"
3,like instructor but not a keeper,I put myself at an intermediate level of fitness. I have always liked this instructor a lot but I feel that her workouts are geared more towards beginners. I need a more challenging routine to feel that I got a good workout. I gave this three stars since I would recommend this to a beginner but would prefer they 1) give a title that is more descriptive about level the routine is geared for and 2) why don't they put the instructor on the cover with these self dvds?
1,Too easy,"This tape was way too easy. They break the workout up into 4 segments but each segment is so short you don't get a workout. The instructor was nice enough, but I didn't feel like I had done anything by the end. And I'm not super in shape. I'd try another tape first."
2,Not a lot of ab work!,"I bought this product hoping for a lot of ab work. This video focuses on cardio and then brings in some ab work. I already do cardio, I wanted something that my trainer in New York would do, instead I got a lot of foot work. It does break of the monatany of my favorite videos."
2,Good for beginners only,"I go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn't want to leave the house. I was a little disappointed in this DVD. I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising. The routines are broken down into four separate workouts. The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section. As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them. I think this DVD is great for beginners. Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon. But if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn't the abs workout for you."
3,"If you are looking to really challenge your abs, this is not a good choice","My FIRM 5 day Abs (from the early 90s?) video finally broke, so I decided to try something new.The workouts are okay, but only a couple exercises really work your abs long enough for you to feel it. I think the problem is that they only do a couple reps of each exercise.I'm still looking for a DVD that has 3-5 days of ab workouts that are challenging... I may just buy the FIRM again."
2,Self-Firm Flat Abs Fast,"Well the title seems to fit the dvd ""fast"" but in a different aspect, as far as time goes. I thought this was very boring and slow, but it was over in no time at all. It probably would be great for someone just beginning and has very little or no time at all to exercise and it doesn't work up a sweat. It was very very easy to do and I'm a beginner myself."
3,LAGOON,"This old-fashioned RPG is actually a lot of fun to play-once you get past the totally basic look of it. It doesn't have that your turn-my turn battle feature, which to me gets too repetitive. You actually earn powers, weapons, items on your way to save the girl. The bosses are not too difficult, but getting to them is a challenge. It is primarily maze-based play, finding doors, talking, etc. Give it a try-for this low price, it really is a decent game."
1,Now I remember why I didn't get very far!,I remember renting this game when I was a little girl and I remember LOVING IT! I couldn't believe I was able to find it online.Then I started playing it. The fighting style is very frustrating and it's not a great story. I just couldn't stand to play it. I think I loved it so much when I was a kid because I had no frame of reference.
4,Maybe the best book yet on pricing and branding,"In fact I was surprised at how good it really was. Most business books are nothing more a string of anecodotes and platitudes, whereas here the reader gets a combination of pragmatic detail and genuine insight into what pricing can accomplish if unleashed. A great book to bring to the meeting room since the emphasis is on upper managament getting involved. From a technical perspective, it would appear the authors have spent time in the trenches, not just on their fannies in academia somewhere, as the stategy and tactics they recommend are fresher than anything to be found in Nagle or Dolan. As an example of this check out the chapter on ""price as a language"" for starters, then go from there."
5,Almost angelic,Choral music by the Cambridge Singers is always top-notch. An older album that might have sounded better with newer technology but no complaints. Has great vocals and orchestral support.
4,Not quite.,"The cover of this book is a tad misleading, and maybe this was just my own expectations, but I under the impression the book was much like that of the first one, only with ""super deformed"" anthropomorphism animal characters as so hinted in the description. So just to clear some air for those who are planning on purchasing this book, it's pretty much just filled with extremely simple drawn animals and the anthropomorphic characters it contains are pretty much rubbish."
3,unforgiving puzzle game,"Lost Vikings is fun to play. Level design is done well. Run 3 vikings through a gauntlet of tricky puzzles & obstacles, without any casualties. If 1 viking dies, you must restart the level (pause game & choose retry instead having to commit suicide with other 2 vikings). This game is unforgiving; some hazards kill you in one hit... getting all 3 vikings past them leaves no room for error. The puzzles are fun to figure out though. The campy humor helps fend off rage quitting after dieing so many times, like when the vikings make fun of you for it. If you have the patience and focus to enjoy scary difficult games, then you'll like this game, because it also makes you think, rather than walk you by the hand through levels.Lost vikings 2 is more fun, as the hazards are more forgiving; most don't kill you in one hit."
4,"A funny, fascinating look into Stanford's inner sanctum.",Robinson takes us where many of us would like to go but probably never will. For better or worse this is a poet's eye view of business school and should provide the same semi-serious wake-up call prospectice law students found in Turow's One-L.
2,Disappointing,"The author was more concerned with describing why Stanford was ""not Harvard"" than anything else. Thought ""Year One"" was a little less melodramatic and substantive."
4,Amusing,"This book should be read by anyone contemplating business school. For the rest of us, it's an interesting snapshot of student life in California during the 1980s. The most amusing chapters were those describing the most difficult parts of the year, such as Math Camp."
4,Captures the feeling of b-school amazingly well,"I read this book at the half-way point in my program as an Evening MBA at the University of Michigan Business School. This is a funny book that also rewards with insights about what getting an MBA feels like.While Robinson describes the experience of a full-time two-year program, my experience is going through the same type of full MBA experience but over four years while holding down a full time job, holding a marriage together, and raising several children. So, maybe our experience of exhaustion, anxiety, and struggle have different sources, but they are similar enough.I haven't found b-school to be hell. In fact, I have enjoyed it a great deal and have learned many things that I am already applying to my day job. But there is no getting around the fact that an MBA, especially in one of the top programs, isn't a picnic. Good reading, good writing, good fun. Read it if you have any interest in the b-school experience."
5,"REQUIRED ""TEXT"" for anyone considering grad B-School.","What can I add to all the reviews out there already? A total ""must-read"" for aspiring MBA candidates without a business undergraduate degree. Life in graduate business school can be both exciting and FRUSTRATING. Robinson does an excellent job of covering all the different characters in an MBA class. This book sits on my bookcase, alongside Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy."
5,B-school students would surely love this book.,"Snapshots from Hell accurately captures what most first year MBA students go through. Coming from a top management school myself, I found myself connecting with most of the stories Peter Robinson relates. This is a no-regret purchase."
