1,Sold Out,"As a fan of the blackeyed peas and many other artists like them its a real dissapointment to see a song like ""Where is the love"", be the breakthrough song for BEP. Instead of focusing on the positive's of the Hip Hop genre, they have chosen to take a Hip-Pop attitude with this song. Justin Timberlake? come on. I dont even have to talk about this its so obvious.And the lyrics? Very lacking. First two lines they rhyme mama with mama's! I would have expected this from missy elliot, but not BEP. Very dissapointing effort from BEP. Not only does it give themselves a bad name, it gives underground hip-hop a bad name."
4,i found the love,"i have found the love you guys are tremendus i love you.i heard you were a christan group but obosliy not. just one reqest,tone down the swear words plez.well good luck at jbb6."
3,Our Modern Remedy,"The Baha'i Faith A Short Introduction is a helpful guide to begin understanding the religion of God, but not the best introductory book out there. The focus is on the teachings, with only a bit about the history. Not only that, but certain teachings are emphasized and others are given less attention or comprehension. For example, I thought Momen did a good job on the nature of God as described by all the previous Divine Revelations, but should have gone into more depth on uniting the other concepts of the world religions, and how to understand them as a Baha'i. But overall he still did pretty all right. I would in now way shape or form discourage you to read this book, unless you were to only read one book on the Faith, and that you should read others. Even I myself have not read many, but from what I have seen Esslemont's work is written very well, enough to be the one I recommend. But I reckon Moojan Momen still atleast gets one thumbs up!!! ;>)"
5,Go Diego Go!,"As always, this Diego dvd is great. My son loves Diego and Dora. This is his newest dvd and it is no disappointment. He gets simply mesmerized by it and I don't mind it either. He's starting to remember the sounds that different animals make and copies Diego when he makes the sounds during the movie. It's great to see him having fun and learning something at the same time."
5,Replaces trashy afternoon cartoons,My daughter watches Dora and Diego cartoons on tv in the morning and likes them. I got this and other educational dvd's to use during the afternoons when trashy cartoons come on so my daughter won't learn bad words and manners from them. Avoid or pay attention really closely to afternoon cartoons for your little ones!
5,Diego is a GREAT learning tool!,"The Dora and Diego series are interactive and allows your children to respond to questions that are asked. it is much better than just sitting your child in front of a bunch of fast, kick butt, violent animated cartoons that are so much the norm these days. But please do not use these videos as your ""babysitters."" watch and learn with them!"
1,unnecessary themes,"It irks me when random magic is thrown into kids' cartoons. We're all expecting animals and adventures, not sorcery. TV cartoons for older kids are already saturated with the magic and fighting-against-evil themes. Really irks me."
1,Stick to Animal Theme Stay Away from Witchcraft/Magic Themes!!,Our family loves Diego and Dora but we've found you have to carefully review each episode now before showing the kids (ages 2 and 4). in the Jaguar episode his voice gets trapped in a magic bottle and Diego is able to find and open the bottle and you see the animal's voice come out of the bottle and float back into the jaguar's body. Maybe not enough to keep most parents away but we are not going to introduce our kids to witchcraft and magic just for the sake of showing them the Diego movies they like.I hope in the future Diego and Dora stick to innocent children's themes!! Animal rescue is a great idea. Stay with it.
5,Amazing!,"This CD is truly amazing! No one can sing the Hanuman Chalesa like Krishna Das. Every variation of this song is beautiful and the additional CD of pronunciation is incredibly helpful for those of us who would like to learn how to sing along with Krishna Das' incredible voice. Every time I play this CD during one of my yoga classes, I have students asking for the name of the CD at the end of class. This CD moves me to my soul every time I listen to it. Even my five-year old tells me that listening to his CD ""makes his heart happy"". This is a must-have CD!"
5,LOVES IT,These is one of the best albums ever. You'll break your hips dancing to them. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT
4,See Craig Kelly,"Gorgeous photography, varied and exotic locations from Whistler to New Zealand to Russia. Fabulous snowboard and ski footage, as always. Craig Kelly - ironically and prophetically talks about his love for riding in BC and what it's like to have sliders (avalanches) chase him down.There's always a jot of humor in Warren's films, and we like it and expect it even if it's corny. Amusing to see the two brothers in the flatlands who construct a monster ski jump in their back yard."
3,Can't learn to ski,In our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage on this DVD. I can't see how this type of product is useful to learning to ski. There are much better videos out there for ski coaches.
4,SHould be bendable,"Love these...cute..great quality..my only suggestion would be that they should be bendable, but it's not a necessity..would buy them again."
2,No Results,"I bought this product a year and half ago and was using it once a week for about 6 months and didn't see any results. I was disappointed mostly b/c I payed around $85 for it. I'm African American with thin, soft hair. I wanted to state this b/c maybe this works better with other hair but didn't do anything to mine."
1,waste of money,"I just finished week 11 of these and I've noticed absolutely no difference in my hair. Perhaps it works for some people, it didn't for me at all."
1,not helped me,"I used this product as described. So far more than half of box of it is gone, no positive results at all."
1,hair loss,This product did not work for me. I saw no difference in my hair after using the entire package. I liked the delivery system; it was easy to use.
3,"Solid, Interesting Overview","I still prefer Louis Fischer's writings on Gandhi, but Marcello's book should be read by those who want as full an understanding of Gandhi's life as possible. Marcello looks at some dimensions of Gandhi's character and flaws that Fischer tends to gloss over, and does a fairly good job of introducing the life and thought of Gandhi."
4,Personalized books are a great gift!,"I bought the Personalized Sesame Street Children's Book (My Day on Sesame Street) for my grandson and granddaughter. Although the books were slight and had too much text per page, both children love Sesame Street and love hearing their names and the names of loved ones mentioned throughout the books. I thought the books should have been ""picture book"" format, since Sesame Street is primarily for preschoolers. Also, these books should be handled by grownups and read to the little ones because they are not very sturdy.I will probably purchase more personalized books from this vendor because the service was good and the product was a good value for the price."
5,OLD EXPIRED BOXES SENT,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT THE STORE GRISTEDES SENT ME 3 OUT OF 6 BOXES THAT HAD EXPIRED SALE DATES....I don't believe they checked the dates prior to shipping the product...SO I WOULD HESITIATE IN ORDERING ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM."
4,Old school rock n roll,"Now if your into AC/DC and know Dangerous Toy's lead singer, Jason Mc Master at all.Then pick up this cd. The man is a master. I have everything Mr. Mc Master has done, and since his Dangerous Toy's days, this has to be him at his best. I just hope he does another one. I hear this band plays in houston texas since that is his hometown, too bad he can not get on the road I'm sure it would be a great concert. Keep on ROCK'N Jason."
3,same ol',"i just listened to this on amazon, and though i just heard segments of every song it sounded like it was'nt produced too well and the vocals were monotone and somewhat bland, i beleive they were going for more of rhinobuckets sound than ac/dc or rose tattoo, it just seemed like you would have probably heard all this before and sadly this sound is becoming and is dated."
5,Forensic Science for High School Students,"My daughter transferred into a Forensics class, and the school didn't have enough books. I bought this one online. It came very promptly and was exactly the right book for the course at a very affordable price."
5,Amazing sewing maching...easy to use,"We bought this sewing machine for our 9 year old daughter. It is very easy to set up and easy to use. She is really only using the machine for very beginning sewing at this point but she was able to control the foot pedal after only a few tries. We really didn't want to buy a ""toy"" but also didn't want to spend a fortune on an expensive machine that was beyond what she needed. I am sure the machine is capable of more than she uses at this point but our hope it that we will not need to replace this machine if she maintains her interest in sewing as she gets older. She is very happy with it too!!!"
2,Constant headache...,"In all fairness, the one that I have is probably an older model. But it looks exactly the same. I have had it for about three years now and finally threw it away the other day because I had just had enough of the issues. It constantly binds up. The tension knob was a problem. I am turned off by Brother after this one. This new model may be better, but I am getting a Singer in the future."
3,OK,"This machine is really just OK. It sews which is why I bought it. But, it also sticks. I have to get it started with the hand wheel about half the time. That's kind of aggravating. But then again, I onlyl use it for mending. I hardly every really ""sew"" anymore."
2,arrived broken,"I bought this sewing machine because my previous machine stopped working, and I had a big project I needed to finish quickly. The Brother machine arrived broken. The stitch selector would only do a straight stitch. The dial wouldn't even turn to any of the other options. When I finally did get it to select the zig-zag stitch, the needle just moved up and down in place, not forwards and certainly not side-to-side. Also, the needle arm was out of alignment, so the needle kept hitting the metal plate on the base of the machine. I snapped two needles in the course of trying to sew a simple garment. It is not even worth my time to exchange this piece of junk.I gave it two stars, because it could do a straight stitch, and as long as you were only sewing together two pieces of thinner fabric, it worked okay. If you wanted to sew layers of three or more pieces of fabric, or something thicker like denim, forget it."
2,"dragging, slow, gets tangled up easily.","I should have bought the refurbished one for $40.00. This one doesn't deserve my payment. It is slow, dragging, entangles, and overall... poor in performance."
5,Nice Basic Sewing Machine,"I needed a basic sewing machine for hemming, repairs and quick projects, nothing fancy. This fits my needs perfectly. The machine is easy to thread and does exactly what I need it to do. This would be a great beginners machine for someone just learning to sew, or is a great machine for someone that doesn't need a machine for extensive tailoring."
4,Easy to thread works great,I am still learning to use the machine but have done some minor repairs and 2 dog coats and it has been great to work with
3,"OK For The Price, BUT...","My parents bought me this Brother machine to replace a disfunctional Singer they had just given me as a gift. Though some parts were similar, this was the better budget-priced machine. I had no problems with the upright bobbin or with thread tangling like some other users reported. My problems were with the feed dogs, which had difficulty with anything thicker than medium-weight denim, and the speed, which is fast ONLY - not so great on curves. My other complaint is that you cannot fine tune the stitch length or width, and you have to turn a screw to adjust the buttonhole length. I also had a problem with uneven thread tension. Finally, the manual was written and printed on a budget. In the interest of squeezing in four languages, directions were often too brief and did not correlate with the illustrations. I would recommend this machine to intermediate sewers primarily working with medium-weight woven fabrics."
3,Very efficient,"I purchased this sewing machine so that I could leave it at my quilting group. I have another Brother sewing machine at home that has a lot more functions, but it is heavy. The Brother LS2125i is fairly light weight and fine for straight stitching. It does have a buttonholer which I will probably never use, but it is nice to know I have the option. This machine is relatively inexpensive and is fine for the what I intend to use it for. It is noisy, but functions well."
3,This is just for basics,"I bought this machine at walmart a few years ago and spent around $89 bucks at the time. Took it home and it worked great for awhile; soon enough the tension messed up. It became more an more frustrating to use. This is just for the basic sewer and is not really a machine that will last if you plan on using it everyday. Best for hemming or a little quilting now and then, its hard sewing through double thickness of denim and good luck sewing leather (even if you use machine needles for leather). Bottom line this is okay for a beginner or the occational sewer."
3,Brother LS2125I 10 Stitch,I am fairly satisfied with this model of Brother Sewing machine. My most disturbing problem with the LS2125I 10 Stitch is that the thread frequently breaks while sewing and there isn't a guide wire on the needle holder. I guess I just got what I paid for.
5,Great machine for the price,This is a great sewing machine for the price. It has all the functions I need.
1,Don't buy this product!,"I bought this sewing machine,because I needed something to replace a very accent Singer Machine that I have. It worked well for 5mons and then I was sewing and the needle just fell down and broke. The machine isnt all metal that I found out. The piece that makes it sew is plastic and broke off. I went to go get it serviced and to have it fixed costs more than the machine is worth.Don't waste your money,buy something with all metal parts and dont waste your time on this junk. The warranty is pointless in this case."
4,Okay for First-Timers,"My daughter is 8 and received this for her birthday. It works well and is serving its purpose. It's lightweight and easy enough to thread on top. I have three critiques:1. The bobbin is a little bit tricky for her to master. It's in a metal case at the bottom of the machine...it is much more challenging than my BIG brother machine. She needs help with that part every time.2. The dial to choose the stitch type is difficult to use. It's big and thick and it's hard to tell where it's pointing (there's no little arrow to point at the number so you're sure about what you're choosing).3. My BIGGEST complaint: the machine doesn't move slowly. It's difficult to master the pedal on a sewing machine anyhow...to get the feel of it and learn to maintain a constant speed. This machine doesn't go SLOW. It's WAY too fast, and it's tricky to get it to slow down (even for me, a more experienced sewer)."
4,Basic Sewing Machine,"light weight, easy to setup and use. Price was right and it has some basic stitches in the options. Thankful extra needles were supplied."
4,I like it,"I like this machine considering i know nothing about sewing at all. I got this to sew all my military uniforms and its doing a perfect job. It does everything i nee to do and it handles my thick uniform plus really thick patches. The only draw back is the intruction really lack...well instruction. It was very difficult at first to operate, but i got the hang of it after watching a few youtube videos. For this price, im very happy."
4,good basic machine,"I am an advanced sewer who purchased this for an extra machine to have for my church sewing circle. I wanted something inexpensive that could do basic work on the quilts and baby items that we sew for charity. It is exactly right for that purpose. My first project on it was putting together two baby quilts and I even machine quilted it and machine sewed the binding, and it did great through three layers of flannel. I miss not being able to fine-tune my stitch length or width myself, but the preset stitches are fine for the projects I use it on. It would be a wonderful beginner machine. It was a good value for the price."
5,excellent,The item arrived on time and it is as good as it is advertised. I installed it with ease and I am very happy with the product. I highly recommend this item.
2,never worked right,"I bought this machine hoping to be able to make some clothes and do some repairs and save some money. I know how to sew and have used several old machines over the years. I thought a new one would be an improvement. Unfortunately it has never worked well enough to be usable and was a total waste of money. The bobbin set up is the problem. The bobbin pops out and is hard to put in right, the needle goes down and gets its thread all wadded up in the bobbin so that you have to take the bobbin out and cut the tangled thread to get the material loose. I took it to a sewing machine shop to have them look at it, and tell me if there was something I was doing wrong, and they said it worked. I took it back home and tried it once and it was even worse, without changing anything from how they had it.Even if there is some trick someone knows to make it work, it isn't worth the trouble."
5,Good machine for basic purpose,i know to sew tops and skirts.. with this machine i did some dresses.. its good product and serves the purpose.. it doesnt come with too many stitching optings.. but good for one looking a sewing machine for basic stitching..
4,Great Mothers Day Present,It was just what my wife wanted. Arrived faster than expected. It had all the items as described. She started using it day one.
2,Shoddy Machinery,"I received this machine as a birthday gift last year as a beginner machine. After spending 30 minutes trying to locate the front loading bobbin (thank god for the internet) I finally had it threaded. After my first simple project was completed (a pillow case) this machine has unthreaded the needle countless times, sucked the material inside the machine twice, and the foot pedal only has one speed, WARP SPEED. It gets 2 stars because it is ever so slightly still more convenient than hand stitching but not by much."
2,Hope I can get it to work.,"It may be too soon to judge the Brother portable sewing machine. I bought from Amazon for small tasks only.I used a Singer stationary for years, loved it and wish I still had it.Just about everything I try to do with this one frustrates me. There are instructions for use but they don't seem to be complete.If I was to buy tomorrow it would be a Singer with a drop in bobbin and self threading. Hope there's remedy because I don't need another ""thing"" in my house."
3,Could be better,"I have had this machine for over 4 years- the tension messes up all the time, if you have the patients to fix this then it is a decent machine for small projects- I can usually complete 3-4 small projects before it starts having problems again."
5,Great sewing,I bought this sewing machine for my mom in law who has over 25 years professional experience sawing. She says the machine sews great for this price and seems solid. She used it only once so far and I will update my review if anything changes.
5,first sewing machine,I started taking fashion design classes about a year ago. One of my teachers suggested I buy this one and well I did. It is really cute plus easy to use.
3,Cannot complain much,"I feel like this is an alright sewing machine that can do the job for a majority of projects. This was my first purchase of my own machine, so that was pretty great (though it was definitely higher in price when I bought it). I wish that some of the nuances with this machine could have been explained better. Also, since it's a pretty standard machine it won't sew through some of the tougher materials.But for the price it is now, I would certainly consider it worth it."
2,Tension issues and grinding,"I really wanted to like this machine. Got it on a lightening deal from Santa to my 9year old daughter. Out of the box before threading or anything it was grinding. Santa failed on this one. Brother was going to send it for repair, but I just got a replacement from amazon. This second one has tension issues. Too tight, too loose. Changes within the same run. Frustrating. I spent an hour and a half working on it and finally got too frustrated. She came to me later so sad that it wouldn't work. There is no way she could work on this somewhat alone with the thread catching in the bobbin case so much. May oil, may get new metal bobbins, but may send this second one back. I have another brother, the 400 version for embroidery and sewing, I love that one and really hate this one."
2,Bobbin troubles,"My ten year old daughter bought this for herself with her birthday money and has had a VERY difficult time with it. Every time she gets it threaded, within minutes it is no longer working properly and she has to rethread the entire machine. We are taking it to a sewing shop for a review but are thinking of returning it as defective merchandise."
1,Worst machine ever.,"I was given this machine for Christmas. I was able to sew about two dresses for my daughter before the thing broke. The feed dogs stopped working entirely, they dropped below the plate and upon servicing I found out that someone had forgotten to put in about 3 screws that were suppose to hold the feed dog lever up. When they went to service it things started falling out of the machine! Rather than pay to have it rebuilt, I decided to throw it out and purchase a Singer. I will never, ever buy another Brother machine."
1,Worst sewing machine in the world!,"so i got this machine thinking it was going to be easy to use, Boy was i WRONG. its hard to get the thread up from below the machine. the thread keeps on getting caught in the gears and no matter what i do the thread bunches up!!! this is the WORST sewing maching i've ever used. I defentally do NOT recomend"
1,"Glad it worked for others, not for me.","This is the worst machine I have ever used!!!! I've been sewing for over 30 years, and have used many different brands. Maybe I just got a bad machine, but it makes me hate sewing. Very unstable, tension is always out of wack, and it can't sew through more than two layers of thicker fabric."
5,Perfect,Nice and simple machine perfect for my projects at any level of experience good machine & highly recommended.Recommend Singer sewing bag for storage and traveling!
3,Uhhh. yea. just pay 50 more dollars for a better one,okay. I bought this because I saw that the reviews for it was pretty good. but the thread usually get caught in the mechanism and there usually is a bobbin problem. It's not all that light neither. The foot pedal is the worst. The foot pedal is not sensitive to different pressures so it is really difficult to find a medium or a very slow speed to a beginner. did i also mention how loud it was? It doesn't even seem computerized. Just invest in one of their better sewing machines.
2,Two years later and it's starting to die,"This machine worked fine for about a year. I'm now having problems with the stitching tangling and breaking. Have tried various needles, threads, tension settings and I can't figure out how to get through a sewing project without the thread constantly breaking and tangling. My conclusion is that it's cheaply made. My previous machine, a 1970's Kenmore, lasted me over 30 years."
2,it does the job... some of the time.,"My first sewing machine. It's gotten me through numerous projects, but I don't have any loyalty to it. I am in constant fear of when the next thread catastrophe will be. It jams, bunches, chops thread, and is generally unruly. However, if you only need it to do one thing, one stitch, one type, with good thread, go for it. it can repair and hem. It works, most of the time."
5,Does quite a bit for a simple little machine!,"I ordered this machine for simple projects like repairs, hemming jeans/pants, and making pillow covers or other easy-to-sew things for our home.If you are gentle with it and take it slow, you can use a regular needle to do all of these things.So far I have hemmed two pairs of jeans, made a pillow cover, and repaired the seam on a shirt. Haven't broken a needle, and the machine didn't seem to be overworked in the process.I like the fact that there are not too many buttons to deal with and it is manual. I really don't need a fancy machine with so many options that it takes going to a class to learn how to use it.I will say that it helps that I already learned to sew on something similar many years ago, so some sewing experience helps."
3,Don't Bump Anything,"This is a very attractive, lightweight machine. Til you go to thread it! I can remember threading my mom's 45 year old Atlas portable machine at age eight and could do it with my eyes closed. The presser foot falls off all the time, the bobbin mechanism falls off all the time. I plan on conquering this machine as the price was right but I will never recommend another brother machine!"
3,"Not terrible, but not great.","This is a decent machine for the price, but unless you like wrestling with your sewing machine on a fairly regular basis, I cannot recommend it.It has some strange design kinks that cause thread tangles at the drop of a hat. Otherwise it seems sturdy and user friendly."
5,"Great product, my mom loves it !!!!",I ordered this machine for my mom. She just loves how well it works with it's compact design. The shipping was great and the prodcut came in before the estimated time. it offers a good range of stiching functions. My mom uses it for simpler tasks such as fixing and alteration work but this can be used for much more.
4,A Genie,"This has been purchased as a gift for my mother inlaw. She is fascinated with the performance of the light weight and the wonderful job it does. The added feature of focus light, that can be used to focus on the stiches is awesome. We were expecting this product to be made in Japan given the name of Brother, but it is made in China."
5,Just what I wanted,"This Brother LS2125i 10-stitch is exactly what I needed. My old sewing machine I inherited from my mom was so heavy that it was a real pain to drag out of the closet just to do a quick mending job. This light weight machine is great because the only stitches I ever use are forwards, backwards, and very occasionally I might need a zigzag. I found the directions to be easy to use and was sewing right away. One of my advantages was that the bobbin configuration in this machine is exactly like the one in my old machine so I knew what I was doing. But if you find it confusing, there are videos out on YouTube.com that show you exactly how to thread this sewing machine & the bobbin. I heard that the case made by Brother was way to big for this machine so I bought the Hemline Camel Studio Collection Machine Tote Bag from Amazon instead. The machine fits in the tote nicely with lots of cushion and just enough room for the project you are working on."
3,Bad directions,"The sewing machine itself is pretty good, but the directions are scattered and unclear. Had to have a friend help me with a few things, and she even had issues when she works with sewing machines for a living."
1,Defective out of the box -- shoddy customer service!,"I ordered this machine and sat down to use it for the first time this afternoon. Immediately, pieces fell apart and were loose. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me the only way they could help me was if I visited their service center -- which happens to be more than an hour away!!! I am not willing to rent a car to drive to the service center at a cost greater than the machine. I am incredibly disappointed with this product.Unfortunately, I purchased the sewing machine 2 months ago and have only just now had time to open the box, read the manual, and try it out, so the return policy has lapsed. Waiting to hear back from Amazon, but buyer beware! I will not be buying from Brother again. Would give zero stars if I could."
4,Brother sewing machine.,My old kenmore sewing machine finally stopped working. It was about 40 yrs old. Was sad to see it go. This Brother machine that I purchased from amazon it a good machine for the price. So far it has mastered the sewing that I have needed to do. Over all I'm pleased. I will have to get use to the plastic parts. My Kenmore was metal.
1,I Returned It,"I am new to sewing and wasn't looking for anything other than a bare bones machine when I bought this. If I could sew a straight line with it, I'd be happy. Even with these simple goals, this machine did not meet my expectations.1) I could not get the machine to start slowly. It went at full speed or no speed. 2)No matter how I adjusted the tension knob, the fabric puckered (according to the trouble-shooting guide, I was doing everything right--right fabric with the right thread, etc).I have used two other machines in the past and I never had any trouble sewing a decent line. I returned this machine."
2,"Not recommended for quilting, tension issues","Got this machine as a gift. My first project went really well, a couple of denim bags. My second project, a quilt, went well through initial piecing. But when I started to combine the pieces, the machine had issues feeding through the layered seems. I would have to pull the pieces. So I got the even feed foot, which helped some. I did get it all pieced together, then I started to try and quilt. It's been a real struggle. I can't keep a constant tension. I would test it on a sample, start quilting, and then have to pull out an entire line due to bad tension. Test, quilt, success, quilt, fail, rip out, and repeat.I would recommend this for two layer, maybe three at most and not for very thick fabrics. I absolutely would not suggest for quilting. I'm in the market looking for an upgrade as I really enjoyed piecing together this quilt and I refuse to let the tension problem on this machine to cloud my enthusiasm for sewing.hope this helps someone."
4,"Small, but mighty","I had been looking for a new sewing machine since mine is in another state, and this one was a great value and a good product."
2,Off to a rocky start,"I JUST got this machine today and was so excited! I finally bought my own sewing machine. I took it out of the box, went to thread the bobbin and the machine worked for a split second and then nothing. I think the foot control is bad. The machine has power, I have re-read the instructions a hundred times, turned it off and on, tried everything I can think of and it still wont work. Am I doing something wrong??? I am a beginner but have used a sewing machine enough to know the basics and can read and follow directions. Is there a trick that I am missing? I didn't even get to try one stitch! I am really disappointed and am now skeptical of this model in general. I hope it's just something I am doing wrong and not the actual machine. Boo!"
5,WOW!!!!,"I am impressed, haven't sewn since high school and bought this because grandson needed patches and things sewn on and things stitched up, found very easy to use, had no problems, didn't remember anything about sewing but the instructions were easily followed and I managed to thread bobbins, needles and take care of torn items. For my use the price was right and I have no complaints."
2,This machine is horrid fr beginners,There is no way to slow down the speed at all! It goes full speed or no speed and bunches up the fabric horribly. I had planned on sewing on paper first but it was just way fast. I returned it. Don't buy it.
5,Brother sewing machine,"I am very pleased with the sewing machine. I hadn't sewn in years and I had it up and running in no time, which for me is saying something. the instructions are easy to understand and I have completed a number of different projects without a single problem. It works very well with what I need it to do."
5,Brother sewing machine,A wonderfull machine.This little machine has alll the features that I need and the price was outstanding for the value received
2,Not for beginners,"I can't imagine this machine for beginners. There is only one speed, and it is very difficult and slow to start stitching; you have to really push down on the foot pedal to get it going, then when it does finally start stitching it takes off really fast. The bobbin is very awkwardly placed, compared to machines where it just pops in from the top."
2,does not stitch well,I was looking forward to a machine that had pretty much automatic controls for tension but this has been very frustrating. No matter what setting the machine is set at the tension between thread and bobbin do not match up causing CONSTANT thread breaking and bobbin bunching! I could hand sew faster than this!!
2,tool compartment is poorly designed,"machine works well, but the tool compartment is very hard to remove. requires force to open it, which you'll need to do to access the bobbin. this has not gotten easier over time...."
2,Why can't I just sew????,"OMG why can't I just sew???? I worked for Levi years ago and know how to sew. I will say I am very disappointed with this machine. I have had it apart at least 3 times every time I sit down to sew. It is VERY easy to misthread the very first step which throws everything off from the beginning. If you take that cover off to clean out broken threads you MUST put it back on before rethreading and sewing, otherwise the thread is behind where it is not suppose to be. I had to stop and clean out broken threads from the very first time I used it. I may be sending this machine back.!!!!!!"
3,Brother sewing machine,I order this machine as a Christmas gift. I received a refurbished one last year and love it. This product was delivered fast and packaged nicely.
3,Nice little machine,"This is a nice little machine. I just haven't been able to sew the buttons back on my husband's jeans when he pops 'em off. It can't handle the thickness, I think.Maybe he needs to buy bigger jeans. So...you tell him!"
2,Good for a while but not good for the long run,I would not buy bar soaps anymore after this mess but overall worked well for a while. It is harsh so I would not use it more then 1-2 times a week. Other products in AL are way better!!!
5,Old but interesting,"This series was published yearly by Luther College. In Volume 4, there are three collections of three essays. Professor George Forell writes three essays: Luther and Politics, The political use of the law, Foreign Policy, and Domestic Politics. Interestingly enough, the foreign policy essay seemed to fit the 21st century world better than even the 1960 world. Professor Harold Grimm writes: Luther and Education: Luther's Impact on the schools, Luther as a Teacher in the pulpit and Luther's Catechisms as Textbooks. Finally, Professor Theodore Hoelty-Nickel writes: A Philosophy of Lutheran Church Music, Lutheran Hymnody and Luther's Deutsche Messe. An interesting little volume!"
1,It would've been great,"I thought I had a steal on this one for $50 from thye office depot clearance table. They had several copies, now I see why. WHAT A BUMMER!!!!! It would've been great if it could do what it says it can do, not a lot of options out there sadly. Incredibly slow, crashes, mail merging takes minutes to process, really brutal. I am going to try to use access, any future reviewers, please suggest alternatives."
1,Absymal is not the word!!!,This software is the biggest joke I have ever come across quite frankly Despite telling you it is a network application when you try and create a database on a network drive or point it to a network drive it says the database must be stored locally!!!!!???? So you then create a local database and tell it to point to a shared network location. They even give instructions on how to to create the network share! But guess what. This worked for a day then just suddenly died! Best of all despite the application clearly pointing to the same database file on the network drive the contents when viewed from more than one location were not the same!! Quite frankly! I have built Microsoft Exchange 2003 server with full AD in less time and with considerably less effort. Nothing could be worse than this application. It is anti-intuitive and user hostile all around!
1,I only put one Star because that is the lowest.,"I bought the ""Premium package with 3 clients"". They have the worst customer service I have ever come across. We ran into a problems installing the product, it would not install and it would not uninstall, we call for support to get help and we were told that we had to register the product before they could help us but the only way to register the product was to install it. Lady on the phone told me it was my problem and once I had it registered they could help me. I told the dummy that if I could install it I would not need their help. When I asked to speak with a manager I was told one was not around and that one would call me. Good thing I am not waiting on that call because I still have not gotten it 3 weeks later. They will never get another dollar of my money and I would suggest that you do not give them yours."
1,M100 palm pilot,I received this and found out that the installation disk was to a different model palm pilot leaving it unuseable. I will need to return this and hopefully find the right package.
1,Horrible service support!,"After a little over a year, my M100 died. The problem was diagnosed by an unofficial service center as a dead internal battery (it keeps the unit from losing data while the AAA batteries are being replaced. A call to Palm's 1-800 customer service yielded this solution: buy a new unit! I checked on the Web where I might buy the battery and found out that this is a lemon fault. Palm knows about this factory design defect, but they're not doing anything about it. I'll never buy a Palm again."
3,"Nice, but it just won't sync","I am happy with the palm m100, except for one thing. The unit was able to sync only one time with my pc. It refuses to sync any more, even after doing a complete system reinstall. Technical support just told me to try to reinstall the software again. If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more money and go up in the models a bit..."
2,Not that good,"People have been saying hey did you hear that palm makes a cheap reliable palm? The awnser should be, oh yeah i had a M100 but it [stinks]. This palm has no features, and it frequently crashes. I got the M100 just so I could keep track of my High School homework assignments. Boy was I wrong! Spend the extra [money] get a M105.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 13 2001Today I was writing down my homework and it performed a hard reset. Lost all my homework. Now will not turn off.Looking into buying a new PDA."
2,Many problems,"I have the 105 w/8mb memory but it's the same pda otherwise. The good stuff is the size and easy to carry around. The bad stuff is that you must use a serial port (the usb kit rarely works and is major trouble). My pda has to reset whenever you change the batteries so I must do this next to my computer to re-synch. If you can get it for cheap, it does the basic job. Make sure your pc has a serial port to sync, many newer pc's do not. Also, downloading software updates from Palm is a crapshoot since many dll's did not download. Support via email does not resolve problems."
4,Handy Device,"I had never seen the need for such a device until I was given one. Now, I can't get along without it. I love my m100. It synchs with my Outlook software so I can carry about my contacts as well as my To Do notes and much more. It has games to keep me occupied on the bus and trains and planes. It has the ability to beam cards, notes, and even applications between units. Amazing little helper! I definitely recommend it..."
1,Watch out for glitches - poor Palm customer support,"The negative experience I've had with Palm's tech ""support"" has really tainted my overall experience with the m100. There are a number of glitches with my unit that no one in customer care was able to resolve, and tech support is only available via e-mail (e-mail, for a tech problem!?). Its sad that Palm's dominant market share has enabled them to be so lax when it comes to customer support. Order the m100 only if you're sure you'll never need to use their tech assistance dept. Also, keep in mind that the m100 doesn't come with e-mail synchronization software; you have to buy that separately."
4,Great for beginners...,Great for people who are just learning how to operate technologically advanced things. The only drawback is that it is not color.
3,for & against,"I bought this together with a compaq laptop. FOR: - my first palm. it's really handy compared to my bulky paper organizer - the shape fits nicely AGAINST: - found out that my laptop doesn't have serial port anymore, only USB port. must return to the store for the USB connector. if the future of laptop is no more serial port, palm should supply the usb port. - no email synch, but there are ""NOTE PAD"" and ""MEMO PAD"". what's the difference between those 2? should just keep the email"
5,All I Need/Want,"I purchased the Palm m100 after much thought. I know that it is limited, however, all I really wanted to do was get rid of the large paper planner/address book. This takes care of exactly that. I can keep it in my purse, not along WITH my purse. It is easy to put in my pocket and take to meetings or make notes as needs arise. I am a librarian and have all the access to e-mail that I can handle so I was not looking for a handheld to provide more of it for me. If I decide that I need/want more from a handheld my mom has put claims on the ""little computer thingy"", as she calls it."
3,Don't buy! Get a m105 instead.,"I am already up to the limit of my 8MB m105. This is mainly because of Avantgo. This turns your palm from a boring device that holds a few bits and pieces about your life, into the BEST NEWSPAPER YOU WILL EVER READ. Choose what news you want, even some normal web pages. The latest news is then available on your palm. just synchronize every morning. Suddenly all the 'dead time' in your life disappears. Boring meeting? Taxi queue? Train? Read your Avantgo newspaper. But here's the rub - Avantgo takes lots of space. Your 2mb won't be enough once you start using it a bit. So do yourself a favour, get an m105 and you won't be kicking yourself in 3 months' time...."
2,expense tracking,Be warned that this version does not have expense tracking - one of the basic functions that many people (especially repeat Palm customers) expect to find on their handheld. And it is not easy to find 3rd party software that has down-loadable expense tracking software (at least I haven't found it yet).What were these people thinking? Or were they?
1,Battery replacement causes complete data loss,"I was happy with this PDA until recently. Now changing battery always causes data loss. Manual says to replace battery within 1 mintue. I replace it instantly (5 seconds - I timed it , have to do jugglery!). Even then total data loss and have to resync everytime which is a big headache. Someone suggested having to supply the battery holder with voltage thru another battery pack while changing the battery. While that would work, that is a clumsy workaround and you have to be techie kinds. Even though I am techie kind, I do not like that approach. Palm should have thought about this reliability issue with this model."
2,Lasted only a year,After only a year of use the screen went haywire and did not recognize stylus properly. Could not fix it even with on-line tech support. They wanted [$$$]. to send it back and then additional cost to fix it. Liked it until it failed - Needed more memory for additional applications I wanted to add. Can't live without a PDA now.
5,A Great Place To Start,"At the date of this review I have owned my Palm M100 for just over a year. I am now so tied to it I'd rather lose my wallett and credit cards then my PDA. I never thought I'd say that.While it doesn't have the horsepower some of the newer (and quite a bit more expensive, I might add) PDA's, it has enough to make it both useful and practical.On my PDA I have well over 500 Address Book entries, 300 Date Book entries (meetings, trial dates, birthdays, my anniversary, etc.) as well as a couple of games, my passwords and AvantGo, which allows me to keep up on news stories, sports scores, as well as downloading a new short story to my palm every day.My Palm is my bible. I'd be lost without it. I'm now looking at updgrading to a bigger and better PDA, but I'm very glad that I started with the M100. If you have little or no experience with PDA's, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,The Screen IS too Small,"I had read the reviews which said that the screen was too small, and I thought, ""What a bunch of whiney little babies."" After a few weeks of owning this Palm top, I have to agree.I think that I still would have bought it, but the smallness of the screen is an important issue. I do not think that the 2 MB non-upgradeable limit will be, however. It works well as a calender and an address book. I have written a 1000 word short story on the memo-pad program using the keypad instead of the graffiti which I am getting better at, but have not yet mastered (punctuation still escapes my grasp).This is a nice starter model. I believe that if I can get my daughters to like it, then I can upgrade myself....."
2,Disappointing,"I bought mine from someone who upgraded. It was working perfectly for him, but he never commented on what happens when the batteries die. I travel a lot and can't have this problem, but when I get the notification that the batteries are low, even if I replace them within the minute recommended, I lose everything. Also, the graffiti is almost impossible to use and the typing with a stylus is cumbersome also. I've gone back to my Coach date and address book that I wanted to shed because of space and weight when traveling."
2,returned it,i wanted this device to work and it did have the potential...positive was the ease of interfacing with my mac. big problem was imputing data either via the touch screen(non-responsive or incorrect response)or character recognition. backlighting was also very poor. would try another model if these problems were solved.
3,You get what you pay for...,"I've had the m100 for many months now. At first I was totally in love with it, then I ran out of memory and had to start erasing things (I do have many games and other stuff). Second, the screen is too small and is invisible when light hits it at some angles, so you have to start moving your hand to find the right position. Third, the flip cover is too delicate, mine broke a couple of months ago and I carry it in my pocket without the cover. At some times, some buttons get pressed against my leg (being inside my pocket) and the palm performs a reset (it has been a hard reset twice, losing all my information. The good thing is that hotsinc does everything when this happens). Anyways, I still carry it with me ALWAYS and depend on it completely. I havent forgotten birthdays since I got it and I dont get bored in bank when I have to stand in line for hours. So, this palm is not perfect, but for [the price] You can replace it once a year, or get a newer model."
3,Great PDA! Too little capacity...,"I got My M100 as a gift and I was very excited since I've known Palm PDAs for a while and I know what they can do.The M100 can do all what other older models can (except for the mail application which I don't need and Expense which I consider annoying) and maybe more. I love the notepad, not included in the Vx.Allright, since this is my first Palm, I am very happy with it and I love everything about it... well almost everything...2MB is just not enough... I've owned it for only 2 weeks, and it's already full. If you're planning to use it for your datebook, contacts and memos ONLY, it's ok, but if you are like me, you will want to install some of the 1000s of palm applications you can find on the net... and like me, your M100 will soon get out of space.So I'd reccomend you to spend a little bit more, and buy the M105 which has 8MB or if you're planning to use a lot of space buy the M125 which has a memory card slot."
4,My Palm m100,"You get what you pay for when you buy the Palm m100. Although it doesn't have any fancy features, it has all the basic needs you would want from an electric organizer. The m100 is overall easy to use, and very practical. It is small, so can fit easily into your purse or glove compartment. The biggest problem that I have with it is the weak flip cover, which I prefer to keep off.The Palm m100 also has some fun features. You can choose the font and alarm sound. There are also a variety of face plates so you don't always have to have the same boring black.This palm pilot is a great, affordable gadget for the hi-tech type person. The graffitti if easy to learn, the phonebook is easy to use, and there are also some great games. I would say that the palm m100 is a great buy!"
1,Palm m100,"this is a piece of [junk]. it messed up with the stylus. whenever I clicked a button at the bottom, it didn't respond. I had to click above the button in some undefined place for it to respond. it pissed me off. it was a waste of my money."
1,Palm wannabe visor,"You can't expand it, what if you run out of memory? With the Handspring Visor you can buy a 2-8 meg expansion module that plugs into the springboard slot. Plus there are other modules you can use: MP3 players, GPS map systems, wireless modems, voice recorders, etc. I guess if you want to limit yourself on usefullness, get the M100 (what is up with the new name)."
3,Take a Look at What is Missing FIRST!,"I just purchased an m100 to replace a IIIe that bit the dust (my fault, I dropped it!). I actually like the slimmer, sleeker look and don't find it to be cheap looking or feeling as some have indicated. Rather, it seems very professional, to me at least. HOWEVER, somewhere obscured in all the specs is the fact that it lacks a mail database which allows you to sync your e-mail to the unit. I had grown quite accustomed to this with the IIIe and assumed it was a given on ALL Palms (as it should be!). I plowed through about 50 messages left by similarly disgruntled purchasers before I finally found a way to get the database (despite Palm). IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SYNC MAIL TO THE UNIT, EITHER GET A DIFFERENT DEVICE OR PLAN TO SPEND SOME MONEY OR TIME TO GET THIS ABILITY. Why on earth Palm would do something like leaving a mail database out is beyond me and my e-mail loving brethren."
4,Off to a good start,"This was my first hand held; it was received as a gift and at first I was not impressed. My 105 was not responding to the stylis commands and seemed to be a total waste. But with one call to Palm's Customer Service center I had a replacement unit within just a few days. For my purposes such as names and addresses,calendar, To Do lists and Notes it's great. I've already replaced my hardcopy calendar and Agenda with the 105. Considering what you're going to use the hand held for, the basic 105 is prefect (why spend a ton extra for stuff you my nor use) but if you need a more expansive unit you'll need something more advanced than the 105. I have to say there are still some Graffiti characters to which it doesn't respond, but overall I have to give it high marks for it's fuctionality and basic value."
4,Palm m100,"Great item. Keeps you organized. If you're like me with a hundred little pieces of paper with addresses and numbers sitting around in your drawers and bags, this will help you clear the clutter without a lot of bells and whistles. It enables me to keep notes and a calculator when shopping without having to fish around for pen and paper and a separate calculator."
3,"Yeah, its OK","This palm is OK because it is not color and after time, the digitizer breaks (the part that makes it so you can use the touch screen feature) If i were you, i would get the M130 - it is color and not as old - it is VERY GOOD for School!"
3,great but batteries make only OK,"Palm M100 dies every 7 days. The batteries just don't last - even if I don't use it. It usually ends up being dead and all info lost about every week. I have an older model Palm III which is similar, but the batteries last a few months before they die.constant hotsync and battery replacement is a pain. try to get a Palm III instead."
4,You may outgrow it.,"I got one of these for Christmas a year ago, my first Palm. A year later I've turned into a power user of sorts, and the 2mb memory is just too small. Nonetheless, if you think you may just use it for scheduling, phone numbers, memos, it is really an amazing little device for the money."
4,"Finally, Lynn's Columbia Work is Collected Properly!","While it's true that Lynn Anderson scored her biggest hit, ""Rose Garden,"" at Columbia Records, she also enjoyed many other chart hits during her tenure there, and recorded dozens of accomplished non-single tracks that featured fuller production and more sophisticated singing than her recordings for Chart Records. Glenn Sutton introduced ambitious orchestrations to Lynn's sound and she responded by raising the emotional stakes in her vocal performances. ""How Can I Unlove You"" and ""Wrap Your Love All Around Your Man"" are just two examples of the spine-tingling production and crystal-clear vocals that ensured Lynn Anderson's records sounded like absolutely nothing else in early 70's country music. If you only know ""Rose Garden,"" you're missing a lot."
1,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","This is a disappointing collection. It includes lots of stuff, and the price is right, but most of the stuff is unlistenably bad. Nearly all the songs by the better known bands, such as Sham 69, Blitz, The Business, etc. are crudely recorded live versions. Even some of the studio recordings seem to be demo versions, or in any case different versions than I remember from the original albums, and generally sound muddy and bad. Also, there seems to have been no effort made to digitally remaster the original sources, so the whole CD sounds muffled."
4,kool,"if you dig oi music, this set is worth it. you probly won't like all the tracks, (i didn't either) but there's 3 cd's so there's something you're bound to enjoy. lots of the songs are live and make you wish you were there. i highly recommend this for any skins or punks who want some good, cheap music."
5,the best album ever,"straight, the best album ever. this and pe's ""fear of ab black planet"". that's right, now get out of me bloody face, puff."
4,A Story that Compels You to Examine Yourself,"William Bernhardt is one of the few authors who always makes me think about myself, my values, my understanding of the world, and then makes me a better person in the process of revealing truth through his outstanding fiction. This is true of his latest novel,Murder One, which does a terrific job of forcing anyone who thinks he or she is world-wise and a good critical thinker to think again, and observe again, and discover that reality is far different from what we thought. I reserve the last star only because I would have liked more of his subtle, ironic humor. I know of no other serious author who can make me laugh on one page and cry on the next. (The first book of his I read, I laughed out loud in my office several times and had my coworkers thinking I had gone off the deep end.)"
1,What happened?,"I had added Bernhardt to my list of must-read authors after his previous Kincaid/McCall, et al, books. I love nothing better than rich, recurring characters. I got to page 77 of Murder One before deciding to return the book. I'm so exhausted by stretching my understanding of reality, I don't have the energy to care what happens to these people."
3,Passing Time,"Murder One by William BernhardtThis story left me less than satisfied. William Bernhardt built a good story and he had good characterization with the exception of his main (?) character, Ben Kincaide. Ben just didn't come across like an exceptionally good lawyer. The murder was horrible and exposing the victim like the murderer did was enough to turn off most police and juries, but I don't see how the murderer could have chained the victim up in the manner she (?) did. She was not strong enough and the place she was working was public.She supposedly did the murder in her house and moved the victim's body to the plaza and chained to the fountain. A man 210 to 220 lbs. is a big man. Bones were broken (?) in his arms due to the ferocity with which he was chained. A five foot two woman with a well-proportioned body did all of this?Wasn't her brother living with her-and he was never questioned? This story is too unrealistic to give more than three stars."
3,the blue squeeze,a courtroom drama. well written and well paced. the de rigueur sociopaths and lurid s/m doom the book to mediocrity. the author conveys his fascination with the ambiguities and intricacies of the law and his lack of insight of those of the human heart. ends with a contrived postscipt.
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar,"A Tulsa cop is the victim in a grizzly murder and his mutilated body is chained up in a public place. Ben Kincaid represents the accused, a nineteen-year-old stripper who was having an affair with the married cop. Ben gets Keri off the first time on a technicality. But when the alleged murder weapon is found in Ben's office, he's in court as a defendant. Ben's law partner gets him off that unfounded charge, but Keri is soon on trial again after the technicality is thrown out.There are trial scenes, office scenes, hospital scenes. This book is just a tad too long in the middle since the good stuff comes later, even though you have most of it figured out by then."
4,a story for those who love and fear the sea,"having grown up and fished half moon bay with my father in the same era as neil, i realize something has changed in the way fathers and sons communicate. to me this is a book about the non verbal glue that holds men together. the only book i can remember reading twice."
5,Loved this book,"As a ex-commercial salmon fisherman, starting during the same era as the Dadthis book brought back so many memories of fishing.The Author was able toput into words experiences and thoughts that I could never do.This is not some ex-fisherman writing memoirs this is a polished writer who certainly musthave lived many of experiences.john m"
2,Not What I expected,"As a Catholic that is no longer practicing because of conflicts with the teachings and practices of the Church, I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a book that would honestly look at the reasons people leave. Instead it listed a few cases of alienated Catholics then immediately went into what you ""should"" do to get your faith back. It assumed that the Bible and the teachings of the Church were absolute truths."
3,Valet Watche and Jewely Box,"The case was for my wife. She likes the case. However, the top will not stay open because of the way it is built. Some what of an annoyance."
4,Worth the price,"I am glad I spent the extra money for a heavy duty ramp. I had debated on getting a cheeper version that were abundant before Christmas. But now I am glad I didn't, they are worth the price. My sons (6 & 8) ride their bikes, scooters, and skateboards over these. I think that they will last for years to come. (I should admitt that I have never actually seen the cheep ones. But they look flimsy and the reviews were troublesome.)The only negative is that they are heavy but that is to be expected with a heavy duty ramp. My husband has no trouble moving 3 pieces attached together out of the center of the drive way. However, it is a struggle for me to do so; granted not so much that I take the time to take them apart before moving them. Also, there would be no way my children could move them."
4,Exactly what we thought.,The ramps seem very durable and easy to manuver. They work great and my boys use their bikes and scooters on them all the time. No problems here and the price was reasonable.
2,REGGAETON CD,"Ok I am cool with the reggaeton sound and the movement but this guy goes and gives us an ENTIRE cd of reggaeton. Gone are the days of NORE the rapper he COMPLETELY flips the script on this cd and I didnt see it coming, thats all I am saying. He didnt have any singles for reason."
5,Finally a simple phone!,"This is a very simple telephone. It does not even have a battery to change. I did get a kick out of the ""Memory Index Card"". I only needed to write in 6 numbers so I used the left column for names and the right column for the associated numbers. There is no electronic memory recall. No speaker-phone (although it looks like it does). It is a modern styled phone with nothing to program. The phone came with all of the cords needed for desk use and wall mount. It has manual switches for ringer on/off and pulse/tone on the back (accessible while mounted on the wall) It has a high/normal switch on the handset. It sends and receives good sound quality. It is exactly what I wanted!"
4,Good Phone!,"I like this phone. Great when there are power outages, especially after a storm (i.e. hurricane, etc...). I've found when many people are impacted over a wide area (i.e. no power, lines down, etc...) that a lan line phone is your best friend, because cell phones are almost always jammed, can't go through... But, my Bell phone keeps on working !!"
5,Life after therapy,"Although this book reads like a novel, it contains the real-life stories of the journeys of five of Robert's most memorable patients. Starting with the work that began within the walls of the therapy room, each chapter takes a peek into how the lives of the individual patients have progressed in the space and time beyond the sessions. On so many levels, this book illustrates how the real effects of therapy transcend quantifiable in-session measures, and have an immeasurably profound influence on the rest of the patient's life. These stories speak for themselves and illustrate that the therapy is indeed healing when life after therapy can truly be a life."
5,All but the roach...,"If you dig the hot and bluesy jazz (and swing) of the 1920's, '30's and '40's ~ and if you like to party ~ then this is your ticket to the zone. Pretty much every aspect of the reefer scene is covered by great musicians and here is probably the ONLY place where you'll hear Ella Fitzgerald sing about cocaine (Wacky Dust)! I'd had the original Stash Records album of this collection for years 'til I gave it away, and the new version has 3 or 4 more tracks that weren't on the album. My only gripe, and it may have to do with copyright, is that they didn't use the truly wonderful original album cover art: an incredible pastel (or charcoal) study in all grey tones of a smoldering roach - schweet!"
4,Provides Great Introductory Information on Business in the 21st Century,Had an opportunity to use this text with students from international countries -- its information was easily transferrable to the attendees from these countries. Also very helpful for those who require information on start-up basics. Dr. Stephanie A. Parson -- www.crownedgrace.com
5,Business Teacher @ Tyngsboro High School in MA,"Great text! I would like a second ""teacher's edition"" for home. How do I get it?Thanks,Tony Z"
4,Difficult but great workout,I really enjoy this workout - I started seeing more definition in my arms and legs within the first week. I have been working out for a long time and am in pretty good shape and this workout was definitely a challenge for me. Jillian's commentary is pretty good most of the time but I am at the point where I've played the DVD several times so I mostly tune it out now. She is pretty motivating though - and she keeps it real.
5,Fantastic video!,I am going on my 3rd week of doing this video. Let me say that it is well worth it! Jillian Michaelz does an excellent job of bringing circuit training to the home. I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference in my body as well as other people seeing a change. I have an 11 week old baby and needed to tone up after gaining 40 pounds and losing 30 of it. This video is tough! I am yet to do all 40 minutes at once. It is well worth it if you put your all into it.
4,Ouch!,"I just tried out Jillian's No More Trouble Zones DVD last night, and boy am I feeling it today. I wouldn't consider myself a beginner (I've been working out for the past 4 months, so I'm no expert) but I thought the DVD was very challenging. Jillian only uses 3lb weights so I should've known it'd be tough. All I had was a pair of 5lb dumbbells, so it was pretty tough. She recommends working out 5 days a week, but I think I'll have to build up to that. Overall, I like the DVD since it forces you to push yourself."
2,Hard on the knees,"I've been doing Jari Love's Ripped workout for a couple of years to supplement my gym aerobic classes, but thought it was time to mix it up so I bought this video by Jillian. What a let down! Jillian's workout is really hard on your knees (if you've got problem knees like me) and she's not nearly as engaging as Jari. I did it a couple of times, but there's just no reason to go back to it. Believe it or not, workouts don't have to be boring or painful. Zumba is a great cardio workout and incredible fun. Ripped is a really effective weight workout."
5,Exception Workout = Exceptional Results,"I am not big fun of Jillian but this workout is exceptional. Love it. Good length (about 50 min altogether), real intense work. I cannot jump and the only modification I needed was in the warm up. It is a full body workout and good for any level. If it feels too easy - you can always add some more weight. I like the fact that it has lots of abs and legs work incorporated. Very good exercise choices in her 7 supersets(circuits). Highly recommended."
5,Another great workout DVD by Jillian!,"This one is awesome! I tried her 30 Day Shred and then started working this one in as well to try and target some of the areas I can't ever seem to tone up. I've always had flappy wings for triceps, but not anymore! This DVD has some really great sets, targeting all the trouble zones like the underarms... are really works them to build lean muscle in that area. It's longer than the 30 Day Shred... about 50 mins but with a little less cardio so you can get through the workout pretty well. Don't get me wrong, it's tough but Jillian is always tough and you will get amazing results if you really put in the effort."
5,Jillian is awesome,"Two months ago I told my cousin that I didn't like Jillian at all. I would not buy her dvd, she was irritating. Well, can I take back my words? Jillian is awesome. I absolutely love this DVD. I definitely lost weight with this one and with her 30 shred. She comes off harsh for the tv show but She is definitely more fun on her DVDs, and very effective."
5,Love this!!!,I ordered this based on the reviews I read and they were so right!! I have been doing this every other day for a week and have already lost 2 lbs!! My clothes feel loose and I can tell my body is changing. I am recommending it to all my friends!!
5,Great full body workout!,"This is my favorite Jillian DVD (and I own all of her other ones too). This is closer to about 50 minutes with the warm-up and cool-down, but it is well worth it. This is more of a strength training workout, not so much on the cardio, although I do sweat a bit! I was in shape before this dvd, and I do it about 3 times a week, but now my arms are even more defined because of this dvd. I use 5lb weights and burn about 300 calories when completing the entire routine. If you are on the fence about buying this, don't expect cardio, but everyone should have this kind of strength training dvd in their rotation. Buy it now!"
5,love this video!,"I started with the 30 day shred, and that video was also good, but it was only 20-25 minutes long. I wanted something a little longer for most days, and then when I'm short on time, I would do the 30 day shred. This video gets my heart pumping (cardio) as well as feeling my muscles with the weights. I started with the 3 lb weights, but they're too light on some of the exercises, so have increased the weights when needed on certain circuits. I love this video and am sweating when done, but feel great!"
5,AWESOME!!!!,THIS WORKOUT IS SO AWESOME I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A MONTH AND HAVE LOST 21 INCHES AND 15 POUNDS!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!! JILLIAN IS SO GOOD AT EXPLAINING THE MOVES AND GIVING ALTERNATE ONES JUST AWESOME!!! REMEMBER TO EAT RIGHT AND STICK WITH HER YOU WILL GET THE RESULTS DESIRED!! I HAVE!!!
5,I love Jillian,"Jillian is not messing around with this workout! I'm in pretty decent shape and exercise frequently, but my arms and legs are jelly by the end of this video. My one critique is that some of the moves are hard on the knees, so I alternate this video with going to the gym or doing pilates."
4,No nonsense Jillian,"Jillian is one of my favorite instructors, she does the tried and true. She will get you breathless, you will sweat, you will burn. A definite buy. Great DVD for those who are serious about their exercise regime.Recommend you put in your daily exercise routine."
3,Very advanced!!!,"I read the reviews before I bought this DVD given that everyone seemed to rave about it. I have to say that this is WAY too advanced for me. I jog just about everyday and would say that I'm moderately active on a daily basis so I thought this DVD might be challenging but something I could use to help tone up...NOPE, I couldn't even do 2 minutes (in any of the sections of the DVD) because it was too hard. I don't usually complain about my purchases but I wouldn't have bought this knowing how advanced it really is."
5,Quick Results,Fast-paced exercise workout that targets all areas. Easy to follow with great information that I have not experienced with other exercise DVD's. Visible results within a few weeks if you give it your best effort.
5,A GREAT plateau breaker,"After doing lots of Denise Austin Boot Camp and Women's Health Wedding Workout, I hit a plateau and decided to give Jillian Michaels a try. I am so glad I did. This workout is tough. I was sore in places I've never been sore before! I do the entire circuit from start to finish but I admit, I have to pause it several times in between to rest. I'm dreaming of the day I can do it without stopping! It's helping me to get in better shape and to look great. I KNOW I'll see results soon!"
5,I love it!!,"I've been working out for 7 yrs now and tried many, many, many work out videos and let me just say that this work out gave me the best and fastest results I've ever seen in my body.The reason I love it is because you get a full body work out in just 40 minutes.I must say, is not easy so, if you are just starting out take your time worry about the form and not the speed and do as much as you can.Other than that all you need is some weights 2lbs or 3lbs a mat and you are set."
5,Great DVD,This is one of my favorite DVDs of Jillian's. I am tired by the time I am done working out with it so I know I've done something good for my body. Jillian is a great trainer.
3,Could be better,"While this video is better than the ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" video, I was still a little dissappointed. I prefer the circuit training and the layout in the 30 Day Shred. I think that both of these new videos make the 30 Day Shred just look that much better. While I do feel I got a better workout than in the banish fat video, I still feel like it was missing something. I missed the cardio that goes on in the 30 Day Shred, and I don't like how you do abs all at once in this video. If you are looking for something different to throw into your workout, go ahead and purchase, but if you are looking for a real workout, I would do two levels of the 30 Day Shred. It is a much better workout"
3,Workout Video,I bought this video for specific areas that I wanted to work on and the only thing that I would like to have seen would be to have more specific breakdowns for certain problem areas instead of lumping them together in one category
4,Great workout DVD,"I am really glad I bought this particular DVD. Jillian has clear instructions and the whole DVD is easy to follow. It is a really effective workout that addresses your entire body (perhaps excepting calves and forearms). I use mostly 5 lb weights but also use the recommended 3 lb weights on some exercises. You can make moderations to Jillian's exercises to make them easier or more advanced. There are no aerobics except for the short warmup, and so the DVD focuses on toning muscles. My only (minor) complaint are the two people behind Jillian with moronic smiles throughout the DVD, but they can be fairly easily ignored. I did a lot of research before buying this DVD and I have found I like Jillian and Gilad the best."
5,Another Awesome Jillian DVD,"I have completed several of Jillian's DVD's including: 30 Day Shred, 6 Week 6 Pack, Ripped in 30, Shred It With Weights and Killer Buns and Thighs. I was hesitant to get this DVD because it is a 40 minute workout, which is a big jump from the others that I have done of hers. However, after reading some other reviews that people had written, it sounded like it would be a great fit for me. Well...it is! I love this workout! Her circuit training is awesome! There is also the option (for those of you that don't want to do the full 40 minutes) for you to select individual circuits. I haven't done that. I always do the full 40 minutes and I feel amazing when I am done. After 4 pregnancies, my trouble zone is my ""mommy tummy"" and even after all of the other DVD's that I have completed, I am still not completely satisfied with my tummy. However, after this workout...my abs are on fire (and I love that kind of pain)!!!I highly recommend this DVD!"
4,Great workout!,"After trying Jillian's DVD for beginners I decided to try this DVD, and it's a lot at first! The warmup alone leaves me out of breath, but I guess that's good. I like that you don't need any special equipment besides free hand weights; I don't even use a mat, just carpeted flooring. Jillian's instructions on proper form are especially helpful for me, since I am fairly new to exercising on a regular basis. I would purchase again, and may buy more DVDs of Jillian's in the future for variety!"
4,Not for beginners,This is not for beginners I actually thought it would be easier than her other 2 but it's much harderI recommend the 30 day Shred to start. It has 3 levels of difficulty so you can work your way up. I will give this one to my friend who runs marathons! I am not ready :-(
5,Intense Workout,This is a great product! I've been working out for several years and this kicked my butt. I was DRIPPING sweat by the end and felt my muscles had been worked to the max!
5,Awesome workout!,"This is a great workout, I've seen results with my calves, thighs, and arms toning up in just a few weeks. I also lost a jean size. I rotate it with Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and the 30 Day Shred, and I also jog. It's a tough workout that has my muscles shaking by the end of it."
2,Too difficult for beginners,I have had this dvd for like a year and tried it twice. I got through it the first time but couldn't complete all of the sets without stopping for breaks. I tried again and it was just too hard and boring. I may try yet again since it's been a long time but I wish there was a workout that was FUN!
3,"Great workout, if you can stick to it.","I love Jillian Michaels and this DVD is a great workout. I just have a hard time staying motivated at home. I'm a gym kind of person so I really can only stick to it a day at a time so I can't vouch for it getting rid of my ""trouble zones"""
2,Such a boring workout,"Ugh. I've never done any Jillian Michaels workouts before, but I must be honest... I expected a lot more. I could've made up this workout on my own. It's like a routine I found in a magazine and did in college. Why do I need a video for that? Boring, boring, boring."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Tried it out twice, but it's not what I'm looking for. It's not my style. Dont get me wrong, it does burn calories. I like another workout routine from her. Unfortunately, I can't find it and I don't know the title. Time to move on to Plan B - going to try out CrossFit with my husband."
4,Christmas Gift ~ enjoyed by recipient,"This was a gift for my 20 + niece who wishes to get in shape, also gave her some dumbbells to go with it. She really enjoyed the video and likes the level of intensity that it provides. She's happy so I'm happy. I found it to be a good value."
5,Love all her videos,Also have her 20 minute workout tape love this too.Good workout compact . I believe the men would probable enjoy Bob's tapes also from the biggest looser.
5,Another Hit!,Jillian pushes me! I find myself talking back to her like she is in the room with me! Bought at the same time as some other workout dvd's for a variety. Haven't gotten tired of any of them to date.
5,Toughest Workout Ever!,"This workout is killer. I am an avid cyclist (80-100 miles per week) & the first time I did this workout I could barely move the next day. One of my teacher friends who is also a certified personal trainer said this workout is the toughest she's ever done. If you want a great all around workout, this is it!"
4,Great Workout. I was sore for days...,Pros-This workout makes you sweat. Start out with light weights 3 lbs is enough to be a challenge. I did this with 5 pound weights because that's all I had i couldnt make it past 20 minutes I was dying.Cons-Music sucks.-jillian is not that peppy encouraging kind of trainer.
5,I *LOVE* this video,"I am so amazed with the results of working out to this video. I have tried everything to work on my trouble zone-abs. I went to the gym, used my bike and ran daily, walked extensively, danced, and paid attention to my diet over the last 12 years. However, I have never seen results like I am seeing now. I have more energy and stamina than with any other workout. My abs look amazing too!Also, after not running outside for a few months, I used this video only three days a week. When it started getting sunny again for me to run outdoors, I was able to run 5 miles without a problem. I have never done that until this video. People notice the changes in my body and I have to say it is because of this video. Thank you Jilllian for coming up with such a great workout video!"
5,Amazing!!!,"I'm 25 years old and I look better now than I did in high school. I only do it about 3 no more than 4 times per week. I'm more toned than ever before and feel so good. My energy and strength have increased. I have tried almost every workout you can imagine, but there is nothing like Jillian's workouts. I really recommend it!My tummy would not tone with anything! Within 2 weeks of this my stomach began to tone.Try it you will love it! I would say the only con is you have to be in good shape to last through it, if not little by little you have to work your way up to finish the workout without giving up."
5,fitness,I like all Jillian's working CD. This one is very intense and takes 40 minutes. I would not be able to finish it if she is not pushing it. I highly recommend it.
5,great workout!,This workout is GREAT for all trouble areas..especially arms. It's not a fun 50 minutes but it's worth it!
5,No Foolin Around with Jillian,"I'm 58 and a wee bit out of shape and she had my tongue hanging out after the second set! If you are totally out of shape I recommend that you start with one that is easier to do. I still can't do some of the exercises because I'm out of shape plus I could never do push-ups even as a kid when I was in shape. All in all, if you want to lose weight, have the endurance, and do it every day, you will lose the weight."
5,El mejor dvd de Jillian!,"Dentro de mi biblioteca de Jillian Michaels, No more truble zones es lo mejor en workout para recudir ciertas libres y endurecer, la duracion es casi una hora y es la mejor parte, casi todos sus otros dvd's son solo 30 minutos y como ama de casa mientras los nenes estan en el colegio desearia seguir ejercitando mas tiempo para ver majores resultados y con este dvd lo encotre! mis brazos estan mas deifnidos, mi torso y abs se ven lindos!, lo recomiento para todas las mamas que buscan conseguir un mejor cuerpo ""despues"" de HABER YA BAJADO DE PESO. Los ejercicios se sentiras algo complicados al comienzo, pero despues de 5 dias los sentiras mas facil y tendras mejor coordinacion. Otro muy bueno de ella es 30 day Shred, buenizimo, pero muy corto de duracion, solo 30 minutos."
2,OUCH hurt my low back,"I found out the hard way this program includes exercises not recommended by docs and physical therapists. You will hurt your back eventually, even if you are moderately fit and not overweight. This would be awesome if Michaels would take out or modify the dangerous moves like fully bending over with straight legs, and legs lifted doing windshield wipers and scissors. Also, superman is so much better for the back if modified. The warm up is inadequate too. I am so disappointed because now instead of working out I have to rest my low back until my overstretched muscles heal. What's the point?"
5,Trouble Zones,"This product was in stock and the delivery for this product was very fast! This DVD is hard and if you commit to it, is well worth the money. This DVD is great and Jillian definitely focus on the problem areas of the body that may need re-shaping! Highly reccomnd this product."
2,No fun,"If you have bad knee, you would not like it. It is bored, not fun, hard to keep going, disappointed."
5,Jillian Michaels Video,"My wife works out, jogs, does the eliptical almost every day. She uses this on the days that she cannot get to the gym or on days that she has a light gym day. At first she thought it was too easy. But after trying it a few times and increasing the reps, she said that it has helped and she was sore in some of the areas like her butt. She found Jillian doesn't do enough reps for her."
5,Awesome home workout,"My husband and I do this workout together and it is tough stuff. I use a 3lb weight and he uses a 5 and we are both struggling to finish the moves a lot of the time. The variety is great and there are only a few moves that I thought were a bit too easy - but overall this is a great investment for the price of $8.99. The only thing I would prefer is that Jillian would give better instruction before starting the moves, at the beginning of starting this DVD I had to watch them before joining in because I didn't know what the move was.I have her 30 Day Shred and the Boost Your Metabolism Cardio and this is a nice way to change things up depending on what I feel like doing."
5,Best value workout dvd!,"Best workout dvd! I initially bought it to offset the days i was too tired to go the gym. It totally surprised me. The first time, I was incredibly sore, but the 2nd time i had way more stamina than i realized. Great for beginners. She doesn't push you to do the advanced moves, and I like that the dvd lets you choose what circuit moves you want to do without having to watch it all over again--but i do anyways. After the first time, you will definitely feel the results. The key is to really push yourself. Don't cheat yourself by giving up halfway through or not taking the reps completely through. It's also great to alternate between my days at the gym & is getting me addicted to fitness."
5,Just Right,"I work out 5 days a week- rotating between Jillian, Bob, and Jackie. They seem to have the most balanced work-outs for building strength, flexibility, and endurance with cardio. I like this WAAAAY better than 30 Day Shred. This video does not use the 3-2-1 method, which I find to be too quick for proper toning. This video has a great flow to it and lasts nearly an hour. Afterwards I don't feel completely wore out (like I do with Bob) and I don't feel like I need more core work (like I do with Jackie). This DVD is my perfect balance- so long as it's muted. ;)"
4,good workout,"This DVD provides a good sweat. The arm workouts are hard but you can see results. You can choose to do the entire thing or just portions targeting specific ""trouble zone"", depending on how you feel (I like that option).The bonus feature with plugs for some toothbrush is annoying.But if you can get pass that, its a good workout."
5,VERY GOOD WORK OUT,I AM FAN OF JILLIAN MICHAELS AND HER WORK OUT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DESCRIBED ON THE BACK. ITS TRUE AND ITS WORKING!!! MY WHOLE BODY IS SO SORE AND I AM SWEATING FOR FIRST DAY TILL 3rd. ITS WORTH IT.
5,great workout!,"This is a great workout DVD. Jillian keeps you motivated and you definitely will sweat! My main form of exercise had been walking/running on the treadmill, and I never felt like I was working hard enough. By the end of this workout, I am sweating like crazy and know that I have worked hard."
5,Fantastic Workout!,"Jillian is awesome! This workout is incredible. I bought it based on all of the great reviews here on Amazon, and the video did not disappoint. Jillian keeps things interesting and fun while keeping me motivated. I highly recommend this workout!"
3,Not for Beginners,"While I think in time this will be a great workouts, there should be a warning on it: If you have not worked out in a long time, or are just starting out, don't start with this one. The first few circuits aren't too bad (I still couldn't complete all of the exercises, though) but once you get into circuit four, the moves get super challenging and if you don't already have some strength and endurance built up, you're not going to be able to do the exercises -- and you could get hurt attempting them. After a few weeks or months of regular workouts though, this will be a good addition."
4,Great strength workout,"I have three Jillian videos (Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism; 30 Day Shred; No More Trouble Zones) and this is my favorite. Blast Fat is terrific for cardio, but I found myself adding weights to the program. No More Trouble Zones is very focused on hard-to-get-firm areas as well as major muscle groups. It works the abs more than I would like (abs aren't my trouble zone), but I plan to tailor it more to my needs as I get comfortable with the moves. At first I was concerned it wasn't aerobic enough, but the constant motion keeps my heart rate up. I alternate NMTZ with BFBM for my regular workouts and use 30DS if I am short on time. My only complaint with NMTZ is that many of the moves are pretty hard on the knees. I have to do the lunging moves very carefully (without bringing the knee over the foot)or my knees start to ache. Overall, I recommend this and other JM workouts."
5,The Best!!!,"I have quite the collection of exercise DVD's-I like Karen Voight, Jari Love, and the OLD FIRM videos. I tried Jillians No More Trouble Zones based on reviews and the fact that I love Jillian in Biggest Loser.No More Trouble Zones is my favorite DVD by far. I just did it today and Loved it!! I am an intermediate-advanced exerciser, and this video had me drenched in sweat. I like that Jillian is not ditzy but kind-of tough girl and not annoying at all, like some other instructors can be. Really loved this and highly recommend!!!!!"
3,This WOULD be a great workout... for ADVANCED exercisers!,"I would consider myself an Adv. Beginner/Intermediate exerciser, (work out 4-6 days a week) and I was physically incapable of even attempting some of the things Jillian does in this work-out. You definitely have to be an advanced exerciser in very good shape to do this work-out properly. She does have a few ""beginner"" modifications, some of which were still far too difficult. I'm not a complainer, I like a hard work-out... but not an impossible one! This is one I'll definitely have to work up to. Banish Fat was difficult as well but do-able."
5,Best Worst Workout Ever!,"This workout is really NO JOKE. It pushes you so hard but I found Jillian so motivating and I kept thinking about why I wanted to do it the first place. There are times when I want to just give up but she just keeps you going. I'm so glad I tried this DVD. My stomach is NOTICEABLY flatter. Like seriously. I'm not overweight by any means but I have no muscle and I kept feeling like I was just all pudge. I've only lost 4 lbs so far (after a week and a half) but damn, it looks GOOD.Seriously, just push yourself and remember WHY you're doing it. Bikini season is coming up :)p.s. I'm 5'0 and was 104.5 about 10 days ago and now I'm 100.0.Just bought the 30 Day Shred and I'm waiting for my Get Ripped in 30 which is sold out...but I'm going to alternate.I'm so fricking HAPPY with this workout!"
4,great!,Killer workout! Great for your arms! You'll definitely walk away from this workout feeling like you're not going to have that flab hanging from you upper arms this summer. DO IT!!
5,A solid workout!,"I own 30 day shred, Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Yoga Meltdown and this. I like this one the best. I love/hate Jillian throughout this DVD because she is pushing me to do things I wouldn't ever do on my own...it hurts so good. The very short rests are just enough to keep me going. When short on time I will do 30 Day Shred. This DVD is so cheap and SO WORTH BUYING!! My forearms were sweating!!! Wear a sweat band or you will drip sweat from your head for sure like I did...or workout in front of a fan.I love that she said 'do not erase what you did here today with eating poorly'. SO TRUE!!! I feel every trainer should say that with every workout DVD - no they should SCREAM IT. I have seen a personal trainer in the past and I have learned the hard way that 80% of being fit is WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH. Please remember that!I am excited to see results from this DVD!('the surrender' is challenging but not so impossible like others make it sound. I find the plank moves more challenging.)"
5,Jillian ROCKS!!!,This video combined with the Banish Fat DVD is AWESOME! You don't need weeks to notice a difference. You'll see it after the first few days. Stick with Jillian (and her entire line of DVDs) and she'll get you the body you want. I'm 40 and my body looks better now than it did when I was 20 (and I was a High School cheerleader for 4 years).
5,Hard work gets results!,"This workout is tough and it doesn't get much easier over time either. But I am definitely getting tighter abs, sculpted arms and firmer thighs and butt. I'm 53 and my husband thinks my body is hot! It's a good mix of exercises so that you are challenged and don't get bored."
5,Highly recommended but not so easy!,"This is an amazing workout companion. In fact, I like it better than the 30 day shred. It seems to be more targeted and a bit harder to complete as it is longer. If you are deciding between 30 day shred and this one, I would highly recommend this DVD. It feels more complete, there is a lot of abdominal work and really hits on most trouble zones.You know what the mark of a good exercise DVD is? My husband actually does it with me!"
5,She delivers results!,"This lady doesn't lie! This workout will change your body for the bettter. Most weeks I onlly get to this program twice. It takes time, but ifor the return it is worth it.I would not recommend this for a beginner or for someone who is extremely overweight, because the moves could be tough on your knees if you are carrying extra weight. This would be a video that would be a goal for fine-tuning some of your stubborn areas after you have dropped some weight and want a good challenge.Jillian Michaels seems to know exactly when to say,""Don't quit!"" How does she do that?! It really pushes me on and I don't stop. If I were working out without it, I would probably stop, thnking I just coldn't do any more.I rarely look forward to this workout, but I go back because my body testifies of its results.Very happy I purchased and use this video...and so is my husband!"
5,Jillian Michaels is one of the best ever,"I have NMTZ, BFBM, 30 Day Shred, and Ripped in 30. These are all wonderful videos. I just wanted to say that I know Jillian isn't for everyone, but for me, she is the BEST trainer of all time. Her style is perfect at motivating me to become a stronger person and even a better person. She has changed my life for the better and I hope she's aware of all the lives she has touched. I am so glad to see her back on the Biggest Loser. That show really went downhill when she was gone...too many contestants with their nonsense. Not anymore....Jillian doesn't put up with that garbage."
5,Great video,This is a great exercise video. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into shape. It really tones those trouble zones.
4,HARD workout for FAST results!,"Man this workout is a killer! The first time I did it, I thought I was going to die by set two! I don't think I've ever sweated so much in my living room before. It could also be because I used 5 pounds weights (the only ones I had) instead of three pounds, so I would definitely recommend following the instructions on this one.With nothing more than two 3-pound dumbells, a mat and sneakers, Jillian Michaels shows you the workout that will give you killer abs, ass, and arms in a very short period of time. I've sent this DVD over to my mother, but I use my favorite exercises when working out alone at home. There are 7 sets, but those not used to such rigorous routines can just start off with two or three or four and move on up. I literally felt like I could see results after just a week! the best part is I'm now convinced I can finally stop paying my gym $50+ a month after my year-long contract is over!"
4,Holy Body Burn!,"This video got 4 out of 5 simply because it IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS! Other than that it was amazing. I have some other Jillian videos and, like them, this one delivers. Prepare to feel your entire body burn during this workout. This is one video that I can feel worked for abs, butt, thighs, and arms. However, if you are a beginner, this video can leave you a little frustrated."
5,Love it!,"After great success with the 30 Day Shred, I was ready to kick up my home workouts. No More Trouble Zones did not disappoint! I get a great workout and my trouble areas are toned! This dvd gets my heart pumping and sweat pouring. I recommend using this in addition to the 30 Day Shred dvd."
5,Love Jillian,"I purchased this DVD with some hesitation because I already owned the 30 day shred (I really like that DVD); so when I read another reviewer's remarks on how this video is very similar to it, I almost did not make the purchase. There are some things that are similar, but in reality it is fairly different. It is longer to work out to, but it went fairly quickly. Summarizing the DVD for you- it has a lot more ab workouts (if this is a problem spot for you), and leg work outs."
5,Great workout dvd! Jillian rocks :),"I tried this workout video for the first time today, and it's overall very good. It's very easy to follow, and Jillian as always is so motivating! I was able to get through the whole video using 3 pound weights, but it was almost too easy during some of the circuits. I already do strength training so it's probably because the weights I am using are too light, so I think if I switched to 5 lb weights for some of the sets it will be a lot more challenging for me. However, I really like how this video works out every muscle of your body, but I think for people who already workout, you will definitely need to use heavier weights to feel the burnnn. :)"
5,KICK BOOTY!,"LOVE this workout! I've been doing it off and on for about a year and EVERY TIME it kicks my butt! I am very active, workout 4-5 times a week, an avid runner, etc...and this work out always manages to challenge (more so than my long run and aerobics classes!)I alternate between 3 & 5 pound weights depending on the exercise and take water breaks when needed (she moves very fast!) It's hard for me to do EVERYTHING but I always love this video. Keeps me in shape! I'm 5'7, 120 pds, 28 :)"
5,You will feel this one the next day,"I have a love/hate type relationship with the Jillian Michaels DVD series. I was not fond of the Shred Series, but I really like ""No More Trouble Zones""It is very well cued. The warm and cool down are about 5 minutes each, leaving the rest of the hour as a kick-butt, non-stop toning and sculpting session. My arms and legs were killing me! For the most part, you will work your arms and legs as combo moves in order to raise your heart rate and calorie burn.Also, I like that the ab work is incorporated into the workout and not just thrown in at the end. Speaking of abs, ""Whew"" is all I have to say.You will be glad with the old school no frills workout! It will change your body."
5,Solid total body workout,"I like this workout. Even though it is a toning video, it always makes me break a sweat. There is very little rest here. She uses 3 lb weights throughout, but I keep several sets nearby so I can up my weight when need be. The first time I did it I found it a little boring but effective. As I have done it more I have grown to like it. It is not the most challenging workout I have, but there are definitely times during when I am feeling the pain! Jillian is very positive and encouraging throughout. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Great Toning Video,"You can definitely feel the burn from this video. Not as much cardio involved like some of her other videos (30 days shred), but this is a great toning video to add to your routine. Better than doing all the stationary moves at the gym. This video allows you to work more than one major muscle group at a time. If you do other cardio exercises (like treadmill, running, walking), this is a great video to add to your workout routine. It is challenging for me and I am not a beginner."
5,"awesome, no-b.s. workout!","I have worked out in gyms (on my own and in group classes), have worked for a fitness magazine and have done countless other home-exercise routines and find Jillian's workouts to be truly amazing. In all my years of working out, I have never seen definition in my muscles like this before. I never feel silly doing her exercises (like ""around the world"" or v-step moves in step aerobics) and her explanations for how to do them and what each one does for you are really informed and helpful. When I first ordered 30-day shred I thought, ""oh well, I can just do all three workouts for one good hour-long workout"" and I have NEVER found it necessary to do that. Even in a 20-minute DVD, she WORKS you! Like others say, they're probably not for absolute beginners but definitely worth working up to. I liked this DVD just as much as her 30-day shred. True excellence!"
3,Not for beginners.,"I'm 5'4 and 115-117 lbs and consider myself pretty in shape, but I couldn't get through half of this DVD. I was using 5 lb weights instead of 3 lb ones though. It's definitely NOT for beginners. I'll try this DVD again after 60 more days of the Shred.. and only then probably once every week or two."
3,Haven't noticed any difference,"I think this will work in the long run if you stick to it. I just started two weeks ago, and I haven't noticed any difference either in terms of weight or on the size of my waist line. But I'll keep going and I belive I'll see some difference maybe after two months??!!"
3,Good exercise bad quality in sound and image,"Hello.I have bought this item in the last month.My opinion.I find the content good, but I could not enjoy it because the poor quality in Video(image) and sound.It is a pity that a good workout is been minimize due the bad quality of the item.Claudia VJillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones"
2,Felt Sick!,"A few things to start...1. I really like Jillian Michaels DVDs and 2. I am in good shape and work out 2 to 4 times a week and 3. I have a variety of workout DVDs and enjoy doing them as my primary means of exercise.This video was a good challenge and I enjoyed it up until about 35-40 minutes into it. It was at this point that I got this overwhelming feeling of nausea and had to stop and lay on the floor until it passed. This happened every time I did this video and ONLY this video. I tried everything, drank lots of water and ate something before working out and trying to stay hydrated during but nothing helped. I did some research and found that with constant raising and lowering of your heart rate (as happens in this video) it can induce nausea and isn't good for you. I passed on this one and will stick to her other DVDs because this one certainly isn't for me!"
4,Definitely a Gut Buster,"I wanted an exercise DVD that would really get me in shape and this could be the one--if I were to use it more often. Unfortunately, I dread doing it because it is challenging so I put off using it more than every couple of weeks. Also, Jillian's demeanor sometimes bugs me. Yes, I want a serious trainer to put me through my paces, but exercise should be fun as well and Jillian can't quite compare to Chalene Johnson (Turbo Jam) for personality. At any rate, it is a high energy program that definitely addresses most of the stubborn trouble zones."
5,SORE!,"I love it! I worked out, and Oh Em Gee IT WAS HARD!!! I believe I got passed the second circuit when I just felt like I couldn't handle; it was an epic fail. However, I thought my muscles were going to be sore but they weren't. Not until I went to sleep and woke up, that's when I felt my whole body aching! I couldn't go down the stairs or sit down. So, I didn't work out that day but the following day I did, and it was fun I felt like I improved a bit. It's a really good work out. And to those who think she's too tough well what do you expect? It's Jillian Michaels."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is pure crap. If they spent less time advertising how good it is & put some real product in it, perhaps it would work. Don't believe the hype & save your money."
5,great video!,I'm so happy that someone put all the information I need to know about working in the health care field in one place! Seeing real people working on the job and hearing them talk about the pros and cons of their work was really great. The salary and education required at the end was also really helpful - and seemed very realistic and accurate. It's so much more interesting than reading a book or surfing for hours trying to find the information. This video really gave me an idea of what it would be like to work in medicine.
1,Watch operating system,"This product is great for older Macs, even OSx that will still run classic. However, it will not work on Intel based Macs."
3,Healing Angel by Roma Downey,"I did get this quickly, and it is talking, and I thought it was music. It is very peaceful, but probably won't listen to it much. I love Roma Downey, so did not return it. Thanks!"
4,CD review,I have no idea what is on the cd because I have no idea where it is. I am sure it is a fine product.
4,good,it is good and i enjoy it and i recommend it to a lot people. my friends and family enjoy it too. people of all ages and faith like it.
5,What Can I Say??!!,"What can I say that hasn't already been written, except, ""get out the tissues"", because you're going to need them!"
4,Healing Angel,I had a preview of this album and immediately I knew I wanted to purchase it for myself and then as gifts to others.This album is a Healing for all ............Catherine Moricone
4,a very nice gift.,I purchased this as a gift for my 84 year old mother after I had recieved a sample of it from a friend over the inter net. My mother called the next day really excited about recieving it.
3,"Okay, similar to Baby Einstein","My son is OBSESSED with Baby Einstein, but I was really sick of watching those so I tried to branch out. My son (9 months old) DID enjoy this video and likes watching it. It does look cheap, but so do the Baby Einstein's, it looks about the same picture quality/production wise. I personally would never make watching a DVD part of my child's bedtime routine (that's a little strange in my opinion...) but it is a nice, calming effect."
5,Excellent!! It really works!,"I bought this video for my daughter when she was 3 month old, and I have played it whenever she was upset, fussy or did not want to go to sleep at bedtime. I am very happy to say I've had 100% success with it! Everytime I've played it for her, she has calmed down and fallen asleep before the video is over! The music, vocals, water sound and images all work together to make a wonderfully relaxing experience. I not only works for baby - it works for mommy too!! It is a must for every parent or care-giver, and a sweet way to help baby to sleep!"
1,My children didn't like it.,"The product says ""Calm Baby."" That is what I was hoping to achieve but my baby cried when I put it on and actually upset her more. It didn't even hold her attention for 5 minutes! I think that there are other videos out there that will calm and also educate your child at the same time. I was just looking for something new but this didn't work."
1,Not something you want to buy,"Our daughter did not like this video at all. In fact, I could barely make it thru the first 5 minutes. [...] The singing is horrible and this video repeats the same scenes over and over like they could barely get thirty minutes of water.[...] I certainly wouldn't recommend this at all. Do yourself a favor and invest in another video!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I thought it was boring,I thought this video was very very boring. I wanted a video to stimulate my baby and he fell asleep. How can he be stimulated if he falls asleep? My other child left the room.
5,AWESOME!,"Pop this CD in whenever you need to be uplifted! No matter where I am when I listen to it, I'm in the presence of God."
2,[Untitled],"Now, I'd never even begin to call myself a fan of progressive rock, cuz' I'm not. If your music is all over the place and has no direction or structure, you've lost me as a listener. At the very same time though, I refuse to listen to another rehash of nickelback. Fakiton is just that; nickelback with a different name. I was mildly interested in fakiton when I heard the linkin park-esque ""take it all away"", and decided to check em' out. So yeah, I actually paid full price for the LP (a waste, I know). The end result of fakiton (album) was 12 song mess, a cross between generic post ""the long road"" nickelback and cheesy 80's pop-metal. A-typical ballads, a few headbangers, and some radio singles; nothing more. Safe, but sorry, Fakiton just doesn't cut it in today's world of crossover acts and hybrid music genres."
5,The Best Band Im just now writing a review about,"so one day some kid approaches me with a red album sampler with the word ""Faktion"" on the front and hands it to me. he says ""this is the most popular band that the world is just beginning to hear about."" I was puzzled by this statement and didnt know what to think. it got me interested though, so I gave the two songs a listen. The music was very good and very well structured, very down to earth. it was nothing extreme, but still unique. I began checking them out online and found variations of ""the best band"" quote and thought it was very clever. I had to pick up the album when it came out, and am glad that i did. My point is that everything from the promotion going into this band to the music itself is very special and has something that other bands really need, and the strange thing is I dont even know what it is. but I like it, and so will you."
4,Solid sound.,"I'd only heard a couple of their songs through Pandora Radio, and decided to check out the full CD. I was hoping all their songs were as hard sounding as the ones that I'd listened to already, but some were much softer.I don't knock them for their softer stuff, I just don't care for it as much. Overall, I think they sound pretty good. They seem like young guys that, if they don't sell out, will probably have a few more CD's worth listening to in the future.Overall, two thumbs up. It sounds good."
5,Great CD...Excellent band!,This is a great CD by an excellent band! I have seen Faktion live several times and they never disappoint. Take the time to give them a listen!
5,Amazing group.,"From start to finish this album rocks. I have seen Faktion play 3 times live and each time it has been great. Quit reading my review and go buy the album, then find out when they are touring near your town and go see them."
5,AWESOME!,This CD is Awesome. I play it everywhere..Im sure my neighbors hate me but... OH well.. this CD is Great... I have my 7 yo singing some of the songs.. Raisin the Kids the right way.. :-)
5,"Faktion,good rockin time","If you like bands like Lincoln Park,you will love Faktion,,above average vocals, soaring guitars,catchy hooks,driving bass and drums.These guys are sure to be on some of the big stages in the near future."
5,Wow,What a great Album.. I love it. There is only a few albums that I can listen to the whole thing. This is one of them.. :)
5,Great Album!,"Not much to really say here. A solid album from the upcoming back froM Dallas, TX. Probably the best thing I've heard of 2006. Nice twists of redoing many of the older demos. I am not dissapointed in any way. This CD is still in my car everytime I drive, it's just a solid record. Wish you all the best and hope to see you in concert as I head north."
5,Awesome CD from beginning to start,Every song on this CD rocks. this is one of the best cdsI have heard in awhile. if you are a fan of rock music then you should defenitly buy this cd.
4,"Faktion, Definitely somethign to give a listen to","i love this album from start to finish it is so good. Some stand out tracks are Pilot, Distance (my absoulte favorite), Take it all away, Better Today. And i also reccomend any of their older material. But Escpecially Septemember. For all at least give this album a listen. You will not be dissapointed"
4,One of the best new albums to surface this year,This album had it all from it's pounding riffs to rockin' ballade. Faktion is a group that is going to grow quickly and their fans base is going to be huge. If your wondering if you should check out the album I say absolutely. The whole album is great but here are some noteable tracks to wet your appetite:Forgive MeControlTake It All AwayDistanceeBetter TodayGive it a shot you won't be dissapointed
5,They get it done!,"I being a musician have a preference of the style i like to hear and the style i play.. Both similair, these guys are great at what they do, the music is driving at times but always full of melody. Even when there at there heaviest there's still melody there. Whether it be in the music or there awesome singer! Im a person who thinks the singer can make or break a band, and this guy by all means is the perfect fit to this already awesomely woven band! Some of my favorite bands are my favorites because how the singer connects to the music and makes it a whole.. 36 Crazyfists, 40 Below Summer, Taproot, A Perfect Circle, etc & now FAKTION! I personally would suggest this CD to all fans of the above mentioned bands. If you love heavy music w/ melody get the CD, you'll thank yourself for it! Chris from the band Cradling God!"
5,Good product that is tougher than it looks,"For the price, this is quite a nice little yoke. It is made of plastic, and does not feel super stable, but it has taken quite a bit of punishment so far from me and has proved to be quite tough--much tougher than I had first anticipated. Unlike many of the other reviewers, the built in table clamps have worked just fine for me, though I do have a very thick desk. I am quite pleased with it and would recommend it as a good, cost effective sim yoke. It's not the nicest one out there, but for price, it is great."
1,The yoke has a problem.,"I have the CH Yoke and Pedals. The yoke has a problem with its plastic shaft that is controlled by springs. It's almost impossible to obtain the neutral point. In fact the ""pull-push"" friction caused by the plastic-over-plastic (plastic shaft sliding in plastic housing) doesn't give any precision during the flight simulation. I am sure that for that price a better design should be a must. I am a General Aviation pilot and when practicing IFR procedures requiring precision in terms of altitude I feel really frustrated and my first impression is to deal with a toy."
2,Alright Starter Yoke,"I purchased a CH Yoke as my first flight yoke; I've had many joysticks and throttles before. I was expecting this to be great, I've heard many good things about this products and it is one in a few that are in the price range.Pros: It's USB and installs easily. It works with almost all Flight Sims (including Microsoft's FSX and X-Plane)Cons: It seems to be cheaply made, thin plastics. It doesn't mount well to most desks and tables that I have tried it on.The BIG disadvantage that I cannot stand is in the pitch axis. It's impossible to return it to neutral! This is due to the springs not always placing the yoke back to it centered point.I do NOT recommend this yoke to any REAL pilots; it will frustrate you to no end. It is however acceptable for simple gamers and children for a first Flight Yoke.I'm purchasing Saitek's Throttle Quadrants and looking forward to buying Saitek's Flight yoke as well."
5,Excellent yoke,"Well constructed and durable. Make the simulation a total difference experience, specially in combination with the pedals. Is a little pricey but if you have the money and really like simulators, is a must have!"
3,Positioning Deficiency,in general the yoke is not deferent from the normal joystick . in fact when you release your hand pressure on the joystick it will return to it's normal position but in the case of this yoke it dose not return to it's original position which makes it difficult to level the aircraft. in addition it dose not add much realism to the game as i was expected.
5,Works Great w/ my MSFS2004,"I really wanted a yoke for FS2004 - I use that program to practice IFR flight. When I discovered that USB yokes are $very expensive - I was very disapointed - then I found these CH products. Sure it is plastic - but it is well worth it I believe. I almost did not buy it because of reviews here, but I am sure glad I did. XP recognized the yoke right away - and there was no need for a software installation. (I guess the CD that ships with the yoke is for lesser Windows Versions). I then launched FS2004 and sure enough - it recognized the CH Yoke and had already set up all of the assignments for all buttons and levers. Took off from ORH and loved the product from that moment . . .I am sure the ""real"" yokes are better, but who the hell wnats to spend that much money. . . .next I plan on purchasing their rudder pedals."
5,Love IT!!!!,"I received my yoke 2 months ago and I couldn't be happier with it. It is everything it claims to be and the quality, I believe, is very good. No ""cheap"" feel to it with the edges also being nice and smooth. The only thing I could ever possibly criticize about it is that the trim wheel is a little rough on the fingers. Other than that, buy it, you will love it."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this Yoke to fly FlighSim 2004. I doesn't calibrate, doesn't reverse, the software is outdated. Avoid this product !"
5,Works Great!,"Flight Sim Yoke works great out of the box. I am a private pilot. Except for Microsoft's slightly unrealistic performance of its aircraft, this controller provides a most realistic flying experience right on my computer desk. It makes practice flights to places I plan to fly to a most realistic experience. Try it...you'll like it.Greg"
3,its ok,"this yoke is good, not exceptional, but good because for flight simulator x, some of the levers dont work, the plane doesnt turn as fast as you want it to, despite the adjustment settings. it sure is better than a joystick when you re flying planes that have yokes."
4,Excellent,"Greatly enhances FS 2004 play. Sticks just a little, so you don't know if you're exactly at center and it's tough make fine adjustments to your flight. Otherwise, a solid product."
4,A Fine Yoke,The throtle is built in to the case.It is everything I wanted.There is no need to buy a more expensive yoke.
3,Excellent Durability,This unit was purchased used from some one. The unit proved to be able to take the use well. The durbility of unit is excellent. The adjustment of forwared elevator push in and out a little heavy. The alignment is not always the same with the internal spring return or precise but good. It may return a little to left or right. Good for single engine general avaition aircraft. Will work well with associated throttle and pedals of larger more safisticated aircraft flying. CD-ROM was missing and so was case package. The ROM was in another unit from CH the 300-133 Quadrant which allowed it to operate normally with there associations in harmony as CH intended.
4,CH Products Flight Sim Yoke USB (200-615),"Nice product, ready to use right out of the box with Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The biggest plus for using this yoke is that it gives you a more realistic flying experience. The only complaints I have with this controller is that I have some difficulity getting it locked down to the edge of my desk, and the trim conrtol is a bit stiff. I also think it's a bit pricey. Other than that, I think it's a great controller, and I don't regret purchasing it."
2,Great product if I had 3 arms,So I get this and try to use it. No way to mount it to my desk. I'm not the only one complaining about this. Mounting it just wasn't part of the design. That is unacceptable in my opinion and whey I gave this 2 stars. Tried duct tape and that doesn't work so I end up holding the unit down with one arm and flying with the other.
1,Bad to worse,"I don't have anything other than the real thing (airplane) to compare this to, so maybe this is as good as it gets -- but I was disappointed in this yoke at the start and it gets worse as time goes by. I've owned it for three years now, using it with MS Flight Simulator, and it has degraded considerably since I purchased to the point of uselessness. I had hoped to use it for instrument practice, but no joy.At the start it was usable, though poor and nothing like really flying. Now it seems to have dead spots that make it difficult to hold altitude or directional control, and you are constantly trying to ""nudge"" it forward with tiny bumps to get it to change and it holds-nudge-holds-nudge-holds-nudge-jump. The jump overshoots, so you are back to barely trying to nudge it again. Maybe I'm expecting too much from a under-$100-yoke, but disappointed."
3,Decent for the price...,"The good: Easy to use, easy to set up. It was out of the box and ""in the air"" in less than 10 minutes. Clamps in tight and doesn't come loose, which would really stink while trying to flare after a long flight. Ouch!The Not-So-Good: The inner springs make noise as you turn giving it a cheap feel. I found the yoke doesn't rest back to the same spot every time, either. My $20 joystick use to ""normalize"" better than the CH Yoke.All in all, it's the best deal out there. I'm wondering if I shouldn't have spent the extra few bucks on the Saitek, though."
4,Plan on Velcro,"Plan on adding an adhesive velcro strip to the back to make the thing stable. And, if your table is thin, you might have to shim the clamps. Other than that, it's A-OK so far."
5,great product,if u want a more realistic experiance on ms flight sim get this with the rudder pedals makes for much better flying than some junk joystick
3,CH Flight Sim,"This flight-yoke is somewhat realistic, but, because it's spring-loaded (not, weight-loaded by pressure on the control-surface), it is not possible to ""feel"" the airplane off or onto the runway, nor through turns, or climbs... the feel is (always) heavy. I am a pilot... not a gamer; I know what a real yoke feels-like to fly. This is a ""toy"", at best."
4,CH Products Sim Flight Yoke UBS,"Well Built, but had no instruction on the yoke controls. Have no idea what each control is used for."
2,"Plastic, binding, not at all worth the money","What can I say? The plastic sticks in the assembly, making it really hard to control.Not worth the money at all."
1,Yuk!!!!,"I don't know if its because I bought this as a ""used"" product. All I can say is the controls stick real bad. The yoke, for example does not slide back and forth smoothly. I had even thought of spraying WD-40 on the shaft. But it still sticks. The Rudder control is hard to roll up and down. There was a cut on the cord, enough that you could see the inner cords exposed. I am dissapointed and not sure if I should take another risk of buying a new one. Just not sure."
1,Defective with poor warranty,"Mine was defective, and they want me to pay shipping both ways to get one that is not defective."
1,broke and no help,when the yoke arived the two knobs on the top were broken off and laying in the bottem of the box. i emailed to see what could be done and was told to bad it was the post officeas i was leaving soon for arizona for the next 3 months i had no way to return the item and was also told it was not an option. i will never use amazon again nor will i encurage my friends to usethem. because we are retired and live in our motorhome i left the yoke at home in phoenix. really a bad bunch of people.
1,Crap...,"Bought this (from another seller) for my father who is a flight sim nut and to replace a joystick (sidewinder) that was huge but worked great for years.Apparently it worked ok for awhile and then kept responding erratically. Pulling to the left or right, diving, y and x axis completely off,etc.We tried everything including tweaking games settings, re installing files, drivers,etc and multiple ""re-calibrations"" with the same problem.CH customer service was no help and did not want to have the product mailed back.Google CH Flight Yoke + problems, not working,erratic,etc and you will see this thing is a lemon.Not happy with CH product and that I am out over $100.Do not recommend."
4,"great, but a little squeaky.","well, this product installed and works great, but the yoke makes a squeeking sound whenever you slide it back and forth... i put some silicon lube on it and it the noise subsided. it is a really great product and i would reccomend it with some sill lube. dont use a petrolum lube beause it will react with da plastik."
5,Very cool - super real,"I have been a private pilot for more than 20 years. This is a good way to fly whenever you can't. Very cool, super realistic."
1,Control will not turn,We just purchased this for our son and the controls will not turn. There were no instructions that came with this device. We have tried the calibration but would appreciate assistance from someone who can assist us with directions for setting this up. Other wise - it will be a very disappointing purchase.
3,some faults,"Well-made product, but it's far too sensitive to movement of the yoke. Plane jumps all over the place.Disappointed in that and looking for some way to fix it!"
4,Great Yoke except for one detail....,This is an excellent yoke that I have owned since April 2005. I use it with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 and it works very well. The only problem I have had with it is that the clamps don't close quite far enough for my desk (which I think is average in thickness) so I have always had to place a wooden ruler between the clamps and the desk. That generally worked pretty well. During the entire time I have owned the yoke one of the bolts in the clmaps was always stiff to turn. Today it seized on me. I called CH Products technical line (except to be on hold for a long time) and they said to ship it back to them with a $33 dollar check for shipping and repairs. They said the brackets were not covered under the 3-year warranty. Keep that in mind.Otherwise this yoke has served me very well. The yoke is a little on the stiff side as some others have noticed but I got used to that.
1,Way overpriced!,The pitch sticks so bad that it's nearly impossible to maintain level flight.I sent it back and it was returned saying it was fixed!Yea right! All they did was spray some kind of silicone lube on the shaft and called it fixed!The pitch SHOULD work as smoothly as the roll.Not worth the money as far as I am concerned!
5,It's the only way to fly,"After fighting FS2004 and FSX with my Saitek x45 for more than 2 years, I finally broke down and bought the CH Yoke and Pedals. Now I wonder how I ever managed without them. Controlling is so much more realistic and easy. After a few minutes of flying around, I am nailing turns without losing altitude, shooting great landings and just enjoying the crap out of myself. Both units work flawlessly and were set up in about 3 minutes. If you're running XP, don't bother with the drivers. Just go into FSX and set you sensitivities and map/remap your buttons. Highly recommended."
4,Good design. So-so quality,"I bought this Kensington bag based on my experience with another Kensington laptop bag that lasted for almost 9 years (until the strap hook wore out). This bag is one of the most inexpensive around and features many pockets for different items, including pens, pen drive, iPod, power cord and mouse. The internal space is enough for extra books and papers. The laptop pouch fits my 15"" MacBook Pro with its neoprene sleeve a bit tightly. Without the neoprene sleeve, it's easy to pull in and out. The carrying strap is very comfortable and the bag is slightly curved to adapt to your body. The handle contains springs that dampen its weight.My only gripes are with a quality glitch. The strap cushion ripped at the seams after some days of use and I had to sew it. The bag's appearance won't get you confused with top-level management mostly for its use of synthetic materials. Other than that, it's well worth your $40."
2,Not what I expected...,"Based on what I read, I expected it to be stronger in flavor and effect. It's a nice mint flavor, but I expected 'curiously strong'. I would not purchase this product again!"
2,Disorganized,"This book is advertised as a ""comprehensive method for the electric and upright bass"", but it's really more of a basic intro and a number of exercises without much text tying it all together. I suspect it had it origin as a set of handouts for the author's students that was later assembled into a book.The few examples of applied bass lines use only roots and fifths. There are a number of scales and arpeggios worked out in various keys, but no discussion of how to apply these to build bass lines.There's a lack of discussion of upright bass technique- just a few pictures- and not much more for electric. I wouldn't recommend it at all for the beginner attempting to teach him orherself. For the advancing student looking for scales and arpeggios, I'd recommend Rufus Reid's ""The Evolving Bassist"". The price is the same, but there's much more useful material there."
2,ok,"Got the tank in quick amount of time. Turns out the burst disk was bad and needed to buy one for $5. Other than that, tank was no expired and had no leaks."
4,Horns and Fusion Jazz of Joao Donato and Eumir Deodato,"I have Had this album on vynyl long before it was ever on CD. I enjoyed mostly all the cuts except the first one,"" Whistle Stop."" I found Deodato's keyboard work and arrangements in the past to be very innovative and when mixed with Donato's musical genius, it hadds a nice fusion of horns and orchestration similar to some of Jobim's arrangements. Very tropical and easy to listen to, the rythym really cooks and flows nicely , especially on ""Where's J.D.?"" <My favorite piece> I wish these two would make more recordings together. Eumir Deodato has arranged some nice pieces in the past and it is enjoyable to experience his work here. I give it two thumbs up."
3,A mixed bag with a slightly different style.,"From a band that not only seemingly fell into obscurity before its second release (Si o Si, Que?), but one who I could find only vaguely mentioned on the Internet. But thats beside the point. Missing most of their horn section from their first release, White Trash made a follow-up CD which I didn't know existed until nearly six years later (when I had rediscovered their first CD)! The lack of brass takes away from their unique pre-ska feel, but does feature a pop-punk sound (in Minor Happiness), and a dance-themed song (21 Club) that was reminiscent to The Crawl, and of course, their typical funky brand of music (minus much of their original lineup). If you just couldn't get enough of their first (self-titled) CD, get Si o Si, Que? for the first five songs and 21 Club. Otherwise, just stick to their first release."
4,Gets the job done.,"I bought this for my tiny watch collection. it serves its purpose, and i dont use it but it has a pen holder for if you have nice pens. but this part is not removeable. That would have been nice to take it out. The leather on the outside is cheap but for the price, i saw it coming. ive had this one for over a eyar, and i like the class it adds to my bedroom. f"
3,Needs to be bigger,I like the look of the box but it doesn't hold my large watches very well. When I close it the glass hits the watch faces an I feel like its going to crack. Should have bought a watch vallet that was deeper an holds more watches.
3,NO LONGER USED!,"This is not the current manual for girl scout badges. Many things have changed, make sure you get the newest version from 2011. The manual itself was fine when it was current."
5,Cadette Girl Scout Handbook,Book arrived promptly and was in great condition! The price was super low and the condition of the book was exactly as it was described. Would highly recommend this company.
5,quality trumpet for a cheap price,"This trumpet is really great for any trumpet player inexperienced or experienced. The trumpet comes with white gloves, 7c mouthpiece, and a case. The only thing is that the valves stick, but valve oil can fix it. You have to buy the valve oil separate."
1,"starts well, then walks off a cliff","The beginning of the book is a good intro for those who have never, ever programmed before, but it steadily loses value after that. By the time you get to windows programming with AWT (halfway through the book) the author has apparently lost interest in instructing on the subject of Java and decided to do many other, irrelevant things instead (he prefers to discuss algebraic equations, code generators, and ""outline code"" rather than how to create buttons and other controls and setup their actions in response to events. He uses his code generator to gloss over these details to free up room for his own meandering babble). Get another book or use the free instructional material at Sun Microsystems'[...] website."
5,Excellent Beginner's Book,"This book is a great choice for someone who doesn't have any education on programming at all.It begins by covering very basic concepts of Java/object-oriented programming well and then extends into several different aspects of the Java language to show how to create simple programs that use text/fonts, various GUI/windows, file storage/retrieval, audio and graphics capabilities. The original included CD is out of date now (2003), but none of it is required to use the book examples and the current JDK is available for free on the web anyway.There are very few Java books that a total beginner can pick up and learn from; this is one of them."
2,shallow and illogical,I bought the book recently since I want to learn Java. The title and other good reviews led me to buy it. It has some useful stuff in there. But for the most part it is too shallow and does not explain the most important fundamentals well. I advise you to go buy another stronger book.
4,Anyone else?,"I thought I had scratched my CD when I first heard the 4th track ""bravery"" playing on my CD player, but I got to listen to another REAL CD and it sounded the same, so I guess it wasn't my player or amplifier or the disc, but the music had something to do with it. I mean, Hyde's vocal was all right, but something about the percussion or something else bothered me in that song. Did such feeling happen to anyone else? Yet don't get me wrong. I love all the songs in this CD, and, yes, they are really Laruku!"
4,Inspiring book,"This book starts off a little slow in that Paula's initial thoughts seem to jump around a bit in the first chapter. She seems compelled to defend herself right off the bat regarding her 2004 Olympics performance, which is a shame, because she is truly the world's best female marathoner. Once past the introduction, the book progresses in a more organized fashion that is easier to follow. I loved reading Paula's insights into her performances. She lays it all out there and her determination and grit are pure and uncensored. Paula is an incredible athlete and her talent and will to win are amazing. I was very inspired as a runner myself and admire Paula all the more after reading her story. Looking forward to more from her in the future."
3,good for the price,"good for the price. I paid .99c for it. I now it was a used book, but I am glad I ordered used because even though the read it is interesting in parts it gets boring."
5,Dances around and past the sheep,"I love this book.(Of course, I read all the Keith Knight cartoons first, then went back and read the book.)Lots of good information here. It's a wonderful resource in these times of massive budget cuts for the arts.The lesson is: DO IT YOURSELF (but get help!)This book will get you started, and teach you to allocate the few available resources and align with like-minded activist folks to get the job done.Should be required reading in every high school and college."
4,Shirley's story is motivational and intertaining.,"For a person reviewing books before live audiences, Managing Martians by Donna Shirely is a winner! Shirley's story is multifold - from her childhood perched in a sycamore tree in rural Oklahoma to the realization of ""getting to Mars"" via the little robotic rover, Sojourner Truth. It is a 35 year journey with all its valleys and peaks associated with space exploration that keeps readers and listeners expectant. Donna Shirely's intellect, determination, courage and love of life shines through and could make an important movie in a time when young persons are hungry for a hero."
3,Comparatively Disappointing,"The above reviews address the factual and textual quality of the book. While these are fine, I wish to draw attention to those who may be hoping for a similar quality of book to Bob Ballard's previous works. Alas, a quick flick through the book reveals a significant lack of photographic and illustrative imagery, certainly bare bones stuff to other excellent works such as Lusitania, Bismarck etc...What this has to do with National Geographic as publisher I don't know, but I was a little disappointed over all."
2,Should Pass on this One,"Most of Ballard's books are large, well illustrated, and to the point. This one however spends most of the page count on his thoughts about the veterans aboard Ballard's research vessel, the battle itself, and WW2. I wouldn't mind reading about his thoughts in another book as he is usually very insightful but it wasn't what I bought this particular book for.After Ballard's commentaries and the history sections we see only very little relating to the Yorktown and underwater archeology which is rather disappointing."
3,"Okay for content, but not as expected.","The book is okay -- bought it for the content and as a gift for a recipient who is not hung up on how book looks but interested only in what it contains. I am a bit pickier, though. Unfortunately the listing did not mention that someone's name was written in ink in the front of the book. I was able to mostly eradicate the name with a little bleach. OF course the book wasn't new, and I didn't expect it to be, but wouldn't have paid quite as much for it if I knew it had writing in it in ink."
2,Return to Midway,We have not recieved our purchase. We initially put the wrong address but that was weeks ago. We should have had the book by now. I am not happy with Amazon.
4,Very useful in understanding people and behavior.,"Interesting book. It helped me to understand my family, and not try to mold them into my way of thinking. I don't believe we can ""label"" people so readily though. People are complicated, and there are many reasons why we think and act the way we do, our basic temperment is only one factor. However, this book is extremely insightful, and I highly recommended it."
1,Never received book - never got response back from seller,"I never received this book, and have made attempts at contacting supplier three times. I have not received any responses from supplier."
4,Treasure in a Box,I just saw this piece screened at a local film festival. I'm not ashamed to say I was blown away! It felt like I was sitting with Spalding and a few close friends just listening to him tell his story.The darkness of the piece is balanced by laugh out loud humor and human insights.This is a must see!
2,Lose Laurie!,"Just saw this on DVR (taped off cable) and was appalled at how intrusive the soundtrack is. Spalding Gray doesn't need a soundtrack, never mind one that is as jab-you-in-the-eye-with-a-stick obnoxious as this one. The zooming and cutting and background images were also annoying, but I think I could have lived with that. The music (by Laurie Andersen) is almost always unsuited to the subject matter. And it is so loud at some points that I had trouble following what he was saying. A total miscalculation in my opinion. Just because they were both in the NYC downtown arts scene doesn't mean they belong together! Glad to see that I can delete it from my DVR, because I can always buy this DVD if I feel compelled to watch it again. I don't think that I will, though."
2,Disappointed in Kansas City,"Spalding Grays ""Monster in a Box"" was a big let down when compared with his earlier work ""Swimming to Cambodia"". This time around the monologue didn't seem quite as forthcoming and fluid in its presentation. This movie did not have the same spellbinding effect on me as the earlier one. Another problem, I thought, was over production. I don't think the sound efects, music and camera movements add to the performance, but rather interupt and interfere with the connection between Spalding Gray and the audience. I gave two stars because the film did have its moments, but overall I just can't recommend it. If you want to see Gray in top form see ""Swimming to Cambodia""."
5,This Book is Readily Available in Oaxaca for $6,That's a pretty hefty price for a book that is readily available throughout the Oaxaca bookstores and also at Susana's for around $6.
5,A Great Read,"Its refreshing to come across a new type of book in the fantasy genre. Here we have a magical being Seyonne who is a slave to a wicked ruler who is trying to exterminate his people. However, a demon begins to wreak havoc and threaten the master. Seyonne uses his unique magic to protect his master. The result is two-fold. He beings to become friends with his master, and the demons become concerned that they cannot control the king. then the real battle begins. This is an amazingly well written story and the characters are exotic and wonderful. I can't wait to read the sequel, but this book is well worth it as a stand alone novel.Relic113"
3,tale of 2 books,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. It was a fresh take on fantasy, especially considering the main character was a slave. There wasn't alot of your typical fantasy with magic and battles as well as heroes that never seem to die. The characterizations were done well and the dialogue between the 2 main characters as well as watching their relationship grow really kept my interest.And then the book changed...Nearly at the midway point the story kicks into your typical fantasy fare. I won't reveal much, but you get a very predictable plot line that follows along the fantasy guidelines to where you can pretty much predict what is upcoming.This was disappointing. I really liked the direction the story started and got through that in just a few days, but found it hard to read the 2nd half and to maintain my interest."
4,excellent book!,"I just completed this novel and it was as good a read as the reviews indicate. What makes this novel original is the concept of mage-warriors whose battle ground is the human soul made into a tangible reality by their talent. After being immersed in fantasies with a surplus of ritual magic or god-like beings, it was wonderful to read something different. The main character is Seyonne, oneof these mages who has become a slave to the people who are his races worst enemies. The story is about him rediscovering who he is and who he can be. It is also the story of Alexander, the proud young prince who is so changed by the advent of Seyonne in his life. Personally, I think the title of the story could well refer to this characters evolution. Berg is an excellent writer and her use of the first person is wonderful. I feel good in recommending this book to anyone who would enjoy something a bit fresh in fantasy."
5,Loved it,"Can't wait to see what else this talented author has written. Where's she been? Breathtaking, lyricism blended with action, character development, and an intriguing new world to explore."
5,An excellent beginning to a unique series,"After I picked this novel up, I found it tremendously hard to put down. Both Seyonne and Aleksander, though extremely different protagonists were equally engaging. The strong bond of friendship and loyalty that develops between them, and the transformation it causes within each of them is highly believable. What is most unique, however about this fantasy novel (and the two that follow) is the plot. Far too many fantasy novels are rehashings of familiar plotlines. Carol Berg, however, offers even the jaded reader something new. I would definitely recommend her books to anyone who is a lover of fantasy."
4,Do it!,"Enter a world of Derzhi horsemen and Ezzarian spirit warriors, of slaves and spoiled princes, of the very personal evil inspired by demons that nest in an angry heart. Join the slave Seyonne and his master Prince Aleksander as they struggle to survive and triumph in a world corrupted by demons. Buy T r a n s f o r m a t i o n by Carol Berg. You will be glad you did."
4,"First Person Fantasy, slightly dark","""Transformation"" is a first person fantasy adventure, told from the point of view of a slave (S--) who is purchased by a prince (A--). The slave was born free, robbed of his magical powers in a ritual immediately after enslavement, and has given up hope for freedom. A-- is a mixed bag, some good & some bad. The book is a bit heavy into the ""slavery is horrid"" theme, but everything to do with A-- is engrossing, such as the intrigue between A-- and his colleagues.Overall a very good book, but WAY too long. I'd only recommend at 5-stars if you are a fast reader or are fine with skimming occasionally, because the author pads the story occasionally and the shere redundancy gets a bit tedious. Otherwise excellent. Two books follow."
4,Enjoyable fantasy,"It is always hard to find non-derivative fantasy novels with intriguing worlds, but this series is very interesting. The characters are well-delineated, the plot is unusual, and the fight between good and evil has interesting ramifications in the second book of the series."
4,Encouraging & Informative eye-opener,I was asked to read this book by the Prostate Cancer Charity in UK and on first sight my heart sank. Full of dry medical information - how wrong I was! My husband had a radical prostatectomy in 1997 and has recovered well but I still found encouraging material - especially about managing impotence. The book covers all aspects of prostate cancer - from diagnosis to living with the results of treatment. It deals with the medical terms and emotional effects of each stage in a down to earth manner. I also really valued the fact that it was written to me - the woman. It made me feel understood in a way that much of literature doesn't as it all male orientated. Enjoy reading it as you approach stage by stage and keep dipping into for knowledgeable reassurrance. My one regret was that all the helpful contact numbers and addresses were all American.
2,NOt everyone has a woman to help them,"I saw this book online, and thought, who are they writing for. I then read it and felt entirely left out. The authors barely suggest that gay men exist on this planet and many of them have prostate cancer. Thank goodness for other books and [...]for helping out of a pickle. At best, this book uses the word love, but does not seem to include me."
4,I cried at the ending!,"Kate Kingsbury does it again with a smashing book of murder and intrigue at the Pennyfoot Hotel. The way she describes the hotel and surrounding environs makes me wish I had a Tardis and could go back in time to such a seemingly simple time and place.The ending is truly creepy and I felt apprehension and fear. Wow! What a story from a terrific story teller!Although there is great joy for the characters in the book, it is always sad in real life to see the apparent end of one of your favorite series. Kate, if you're reading this, I hope you have future plans for the Pennyfoot and its inhabitants.I welcome comments from others regarding this book. Email me!"
1,"Callous, selfish amateur sleuth","Cicely, owner of the Pennyfoot Hotel has 3 new teenage maids (1 as young as 13). One might think she would feel some responsibility for their well-being and safety. But no, as they are murdered one by one, her reaction is callous and selfish. Oh dear, what a shame, but the important thing is for her business to be unharmed by these unfortunate deaths. She conceals information from the police, doesn't inform her guests that they are in danger and makes no effort to keep the maids safe. They are sent alone to dark, lonely areas of the hotel and out-buildings - and when one of the maids says she's afraid - the housekeeper yells at her and sends her off to her death. Cicely feels no responsibility for this even though she is in charge and the staff is following her orders. Appalling! I'll never read another book by Kate Kingsbury."
4,Good Murder mystery!!!,"If you like a good murder mystery to read set in the victoria era you'll like this series! I've read a lot of hr books from this series, you really feel like the characters are friends that you'll want to revisit."
2,melt's away during day,"At the end of an 8 hour day, i end up with a line of color next to my eyeliner, i was really hoping that this product would stay put!!!"
4,This is a very good book,"For eight months during 1945 I served as a Japanese interpreter (U.S. Marine Corps) at the Japanese POW Camp on Guam. I met and interviewed many Japanese prisoners during that time. This is the first account published by a former Japanese POW that I have seen since the War. American POWS have published but no Japanese for reasons made obvious by the author. I was on the outside looking in. To view prison life from the other side of the fence was most interesting, The book is superbly written. It is factual and honest.For anyone who fought the Japanese in the Pacific this book will open windows and offer to you a view that you might never have expected to look upon. T"
3,Documented History of Human American Treatment of Japanese WW11 POWs,What a difference reading this book about the treatment of Japanese POWs by Allies after reading the book The Knights of Bushido and its description of the death and horror wreaked by the Japanese military on POWs and civilians. Quite a comparison of the clash of two cultures.
5,Weber Kettle Rotisserie,"the rotisserie came right on time, I'm very happy with Amazon! I'm also very happy with Weber. It is exactly what i wanted. I only used the rotisserie once. for my first try I figured I'd get a beef roast(4LBs), just salt, pepper, garlic and onion as a rub. 1 1/2 hrs over charcoal(about 375 degrees) with one chunk of hickory in the coals. It came out very moist and very flavorful. I can't wait to use my rotisserie again."
4,Weber rotisserie,Weber 2290 22-1/2-Inch Charcoal Kettle RotisserieVery easy to set up and use (much easier that installing a rotisserie on a gas grill). Food has been everything I expected. We've had chicken and a turkey breast so far along with using the additional height to make bear can chicken. Great taste and so moist. The only negative is the lack of air seal at the bottom of the unit. This results in not being able to starve the coal from air when you are done. The coals keep burning until they are completely burnt off. Don't plan on covering or storing your grill until the next day.
4,"Great addition to a Weber Kettle, but...",It came slightly out of round and doesn't seal as well as it should. This has been overcome by adding a bit of foil to the air gaps....Rotisserie over charcoal is awesome.
5,Awesome,Great product. Makes fantastic rotisserie chicken. Easy to clean. Do yourself a favor and get this for your Weber Charcoal Kettle grill.
4,Looks awesome,"And the chicken drippings drip right onto the ribs under, good news.My favorite thing about it is that it looks really cool, people freak.Conversely, my chickens don't taste appreciably better than the ones I roast in the oven.My OTHER favorite thing is that putting the grill attachment (and not the stake) on my grill gives me the added depth needed to use a rib rack, so that thing just lives on there."
5,Better chickens and turkeys,"We have owned Weber barbques for years and the rotisserie is an important accessory if you are doing chickens and turkeys. They are so much more juicy with the rotisserie than just sitting in the rack. Two chickens at a time (actually you can to three) should be about the same size for cooking time. Bigger are better, at least 4 lbs each. They will take about an hour and 20 minutes. Turkeys can be up to about 12 lbs. A pop-out timer is recommended, you can buy them separately if the turkey doesn't come with one. Hickory chips for smoke are good. Use lots of salt on the skin so the smoke will flavor the meat (and don't eat the skin:-) Be sure to catch the drippings in a Weber pan for the gravey."
5,Excellent Poduct,I think at $130 the price is excessive but the product does work well and does seem well made. I wish you could adjust the speed of rotation but the speed chosen worked well with (2) 4 lb chickens on the unit. Overall a good buy and I am looking forward to trying some more fowl and roasts on this product!
1,Not a good choice,Frankly its way toooooo much trouble. Once I figured it out how to use it( limited instructions) really a better end result could be achieved simply by using other less expensive methods. I say don't spend your money. If I had the box I would defiantly return it.
5,Get it homes,Awesome product yields delicious food. If you have a kettle get the rotisserie you will never grill chicken without it again
4,Awesome addition to the Webber Performer,"Handy little unit to add to your kettle grill. Powerful, quite motor. Electric so no need to worry about weak batteries. A lttle cumbersome to store so keep the box. Well worth the money. Turkey brined or not comes out AWESOME. Just set it and forget it."
5,The Best Big Accessory For Your Weber,"My wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. I think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the Thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit. I did, and it was simply outstanding! I have done several turkeys, chickens, and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort. If you have a 22.5-inch Weber kettle, you need this rotisserie!"
5,WEBER's BEST ACCESSORY !,"If I could give this rotisserie more stars I would. I've had mine for eight years now and it is the best possible accessory you can buy for a WEBER KETTLE. It will transform your barbecue cooking experience. I rotisserie chicken, duck and turkey on a regular basis. I suggest buying two additional spit forks (for a total of four) so you can cook two chickens or ducks at one time. Buy the spits with four prongs not the two prongs.When cooking chicken, close the bottom vent and leave the top vent fully open (this will maintains the temperature at about 325 - 350 degrees) and cook for one hour and 45 minutes to two hours.To cook a 12-14 pound turkey do the same as chicken but cook for about 3 hours or so. When cooking turkey you will need to add some briquettes hourly to maintain the temperature for that long a period. I just time my rotisserie meats and leave the lid on to maintain temperature.Once you use a WEBER rotisserie you wonder how you did without one!"
3,weber rotessiere,"Quality not as good as one I had years ago. Doesnt fit snuggly as the old one did, and it rocks a bit. Haven't used it yet, but should work ok"
1,Disappointing!,Very Disappointing! I purchased this as a gift. By the time the gift was opened the return had expired. Upon opening it was discovered that there was no spit or handle included and I've been unable to find a way of ordering the missing parts. Very Disappointing as this makes the unit useless! Would love for Amazon or Weber to contact me but can't seem to get them to respond to my questions.
5,Get it while you can,"While I have used a Weber charcoal grill forever, I never took the plunge and bought the rotisserie attachment. I heard that they have been discontinued by Weber, so I shopped around for the best deal and got one.If you are a charcoal griller by nature, this is something you need! Great for Chicken, roasts, prime rib, or leg of lamb."
4,"Great Tool for BBQ, but needs improvement","I bought this for the purpose to BBQ big turkeys in 18-20 lbs. Because the turkey is so big, additional space above stainless steel grill is needed. Adding ring will give another 6 inch height so that a big turkey can fit in with cover on. Rotisserie cooking a big turkey is impossible due to the weight. I used a turkey canon filled with beer in similar style as BBQ beer can chicken. The result was a big success. The white meat is juice and flavored with wood smoke. I used hickory.However, Weber could improve the design so that the ring can fit better and no air leaks out through joint. Holes or opening should be plugged when rotisserie rod is not used. Leaking opening made controlling temperature slightly difficult. Temperature control is critical in long hours BBQ to avoid burned or undercooked bird."
4,"Great Album, but not Keith's best","This is an incredible album, 100 times better than almost every other hip hop album to come out in 2001. Keith proves that he is the most consistent and interesting MC in hip hop. The only thing that he could improve is the beats. Some of them are pretty weak. But, all in all, a future classic. This is a great album to listen to when you are very, very drunk."
4,"Not his best, but not his worst....","This is actually a great album. Many Kool Keith fans may say this album is garbage, but I have to disagree. No of course this album isnt anything close to Octagon or Sex Style, or even Black Elvis, but still this is Kool Keith. This album is very original and I love the hooks and production. This album is more compared to the Black Elvis lp due to the fact his tracks are softer than ones compared to Dr Dooom or Matthew. I would have given this album 5 stars but this doesnt top some of his other albums. If you dont have this lp you should pick it up as soon as you can ..."
2,is this a spoken word album?,"KOOL KEITH IS OUT OF HIS FREAKIN MIND.I DONT THINK HE EVEN KNOWS WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT HALF THE TIME.HIS FLOW DOSNT EVEN GO TO THE BEAT HALF THE TIME AND IT SOUNDS LIKE SPOKEN WORD.THE BEATS ARE AVERAGE AND THE CD PACKAGE IS BUDGET.IF YOU WANNA HEAR ONE OF THE BEST KEITH SONGS CHECK OUT ""GROOVE TERMINATOR"". ITS A GUY OUT OF AUSTRALIA AND KEITH IS ON SONG NUMBER FIVE."
2,Wack,"You know, I am a pretty big fan of most everything Keith touches (and nogatco rd. is hilarious) but, man, this CD is... WACK! I'm not looking for the sounds of Dr. Octagon, but some originality [...] would be greatly appreciated. He doesent even try to follow a theme (outside of his usual nonsensical rants)even though the cover of the album would lead you to think otherwise.. His beats are recycled; I identified at least four common beats that were recycled from as far back as Dr. DOOOM, they just have a different sound filter over the beat so it sounds different, but I found myself rapping 'apartment 223' off of Dr. DOOOM when I was listening to this album, because some of the beats are so...stale and plastic. I know you can't win all the time, but this cd was not cheap (compared to some of his other work), and I am quite dissapointed."
2,What the...?,"Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis? ""Spankmaster"" represents a regression of creative energy. It sounds like Keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks. It contains little of the genius of his earlier CDs. With the exception of a couple songs (""jewelry shine"" and ""Blackula""), this album stinks."
2,this is just boring.,"ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when it first came out and, sadly, still it's very weak. I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing. By far it's his worst album. He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track."
4,"The best for beginners, but...","Davis's ""Organists Manual"" is THE method for beginning organists. It contains repertoire at graded levels of difficulty that can be used all throughout the organist's career, and technical exercises that help with problems contained in the book's repertoire. However, organists who want to advance their technique will probably need to buy another method with more technical exercises--especially pedal exercises."
5,Everything a Teacher or Student Could Want,My teacher uses this book faithfully for organ instruction and after using it in lessons I can see why: it contains basic exercises for warming up and achieving finger coordination and dexterity. It also contains some of the best organ pieces that a person of any experience can play to increase his or her technique. A must have for teachers and students.
5,Excellent Learning Material,"This book is excellent for learning or reviewing organ skills; uses actual, common organist pieces for learning, not boring exercises like many books;Speedy, on-time delivery from amazon"
3,Inside great Cover not so great.,"I bought this as a Christmas present so was very disappointed to find though advertised as new the cover looked like something had been dropped on it. It was scuffed badly. I didn't have time to return it for exchange and the person who received it ""said"" it was okay I was upset. If something says new it should look new."
5,Organist Manual:,An excellent source of information and technical exercises for a beginning organist. It covers all the fundamental techniques including registrations and pedal keyboard techniques.
1,not packed properly...,"I was so disappointed to receive this item broken on the initial shipment - then when it was shipped the second time, it was broken also. Whoever packaged it for shipping did not pack it properly - just threw it in a box and sent it on it's way. Then the thing that really bothered me - they informed me they couldn't provide a replacement. It was a gift, and the person was really disappointed. (this was three weeks later)"
5,Creative - Funny - Down right cute,"This book puts a C-U-T-E spin on the humdrum nursery rhymes. Instead of the same old rhymes we all grew up with, these have a humorous twist....guaranteed to be a repeat read!"
5,Funny twist to common nursery rhymes,"Many of the best known nursery rhymes are changed with a funny twist in ""Mary Had a Little Jam and Other Silly Rhymes"" by Bruce Lansky. While I did not find all of the rhymes funny, there were a lot that made me laugh. My daughter also enjoyed the book."
1,It Is not a karaoke version for singers!!!!!,I bought this product for my business thinking that I can use it in the parties but I can't because it have the voices on it. that is misleading. If you just want to listen the song this is the song for you but not for karaoke purposes.
3,Great Live Action,For a Live action based of a great anime series this move did very well. There are some changes but you have to expect that with a movie. The ending you will have to see.
3,DEATH NOTE!,"though I have to say I was disappointed by the look of Misa's character in the 2nd film and how they had condensed so much of it to fit it all into just 2 hours of film, I was overall pleased.I still only wish they had brought back the original voice for rem from the anime though."
2,could be better,the movie was decent at best but they went so far from canon that it wasn't really deathnote anymore. the only bright spot was that L won so we don't have to put up with the inadequate heroes Near and Mellow.
3,its ok,"the first dvd was ok, but this is where the movie starts to fall apart. The anime is a lot better. L actually gets killed in the anime"
1,User friendly? not really....,The interface for this program is not easy to figure out and is not concise. It really needs to come with a full tutorial. my money could have been better spent on something else and i haven't used it once since the day i opened it up and tried it out on the computer. look elsewhere for planning software.
1,Be advised!,"I was unable to use this software at all. I installed on my 2 year old ibook laptop and it wouldn't run. Customer service is horrid - only by email and it took a week to hear back after I sent 2 emails. Then I loaded an update as they suggested and still not able to use the software in any shape or form. Emailed customer service again and received a response, after four days, saying another update would be available in a few weeks, wait until then! Weddings kind of have a timeline. I would NOT recommend this software at all!!"
1,Does not work with mac,"I bought this product from the apple store and assumed that it would work on macs. Boy, was I wrong. As other people have stated, this product does not save any information. The interface lags, and the software is not easy to use at all. The tutorials are inadequate. Even as an experienced mac user, I still had problems with this software. Skip the frustration and look for better software out there."
2,Save your money,"As a planner, I buy things like this to see how this compares to the service I provide my clients. Well, this one wasn't so hot.

5,beautiful beautiful beautiful,"Okay, so I am a really big Stereolab fan. Obsessed really. This album is the best they have ever done and the best they will probably ever do. it exists in a wonderful place between art and rock. If you like one chord that drones on and on for a really long time, you'll love this. They seem to be dually influenced by bands like Velvet Underground and minimalist composers like Steve Reich. Makes you think and makes you groove at the same time. Simply the best I have ever heard and I never tire of listening to it!"
4,an overshaddowed gem,"Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Switched On have been the only two Stereolab records that I find myself ever listening to with any regularity. Somehow, this record has now also creeped its way into the running, years after my first few listens. I will replay Transient Random with as much fervor and enjoyment as my other Stereolab favorites from now on. Its appeal is more subtle, often overlooked and well worth the download."
1,"Do not waste your money, you can find a better map for free downtown in the tourist center.","I bought this for an upcoming trip to Copenhagen. My husband the expert navigator that he is got really irritated with it and refused to use it. We found a better map for free at the tourist center located downtown. It's pretty easy to find, it's the one that has a bakery in the same room. Save your money don't buy this thing it's useless and overpriced."
1,Don't bother,"My old cutters are a reversible set from Grizzley. I wanted a set that I could just switch arbors on the shaper and be ready to go. The problem with these particular cutters is they don't use a bearing. So, if all your shaping is on straight cuts, these will work fine. If you want to make a door with an arch, however, these are worthless. Freud sells a bearing to go with the set, but the way the cutters are designed, unless you have an inch thick piece of stock, the wood misses the bearing. I'm sticking with my Grizzley reversible cutters."
2,"Inconsistent, unreal, not one of L'engle's best","I wish that L'Engel would keep the storylines for the Austins more realistic. Most of her books in the Austin series are realistic, but I found this one to be far-fetched and heavy-handed. Instead of the political overtones I would have preferred a simpler story focusing on Vicky's relationship with Adam. I also find the premise of an ordinary high school student suddenly journeying to Antarctica and getting caught up in political intrigue to be inconsistent with the author's past work about Vicky Austin."
2,Extremely disappointing after Ring of Endless Light,"I was so excited when I found this book, and so disappointed when I *read* it. The information about Antarctica was interesting, but Vicky's character seemed flat, dull and gullible. As a sequel to the incredible Ring of Endless Light, this is a failure."
5,"read it, you will LOVE IT","If you liked A Ring of Endless light, you will most certainly like troubling a star, it is fantastic. i found it almost as good as a ring of endless light, and that is a high compliment. troubling a star is a sequel kind of to a ring of endless light and it follows her and her friend adam eddington to (of all places) antarctica. trust me, you will LOVE this book. it is thick in plot and interesting to read. it will keep you on your toes and dying to read more. i hope you enjoy, i did."
5,Madeline L'Engle: PLEASE read this!,"TAS was the 2nd best book I have read yet. Of course no one can really compare "" A ring of Endless Light"" to anything because it far exceeds everything else. Vicky Austin is my favorite charecter of all that you created.I really hate critisim, and I'd like to see those other people write a book better than ""Troubleing A Star"". My personal opinion, to you Ms. L'Engle: the story was wonderful. I love books about Vicky. Keep writing and i'll keep reading.love, LyNn"
5,A great story.,"Troubling a star is one of the best books I have ever read. Ithas so many different characters and emotions going on. It is a storyof deceit, love, adventure, and mystery all in one. Also, the main character is very well described by the author. The format of the book is very nice too. this book starts a little slowly, but soon you are hooked. I read the whole book in one day because it was so hard to put down. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story, with interesting characters, and a wonderful plot."
4,fairly good read,I wanted to love this book and I did enjoy it but it was not one of my favorites. I think I wanted there to be more of Vicky and Adam which there was not enough of in my opinion. But the story was a new and interesting tale.
4,good...,"this book is pretty good. it starts out as usual with vicki being courted (followed?) by a group of boys. then adam asks her to go with him to antarctica, and on the way vicki gets involved in stuff that mysteriously involves her. well, it is a worhty read, but it takes a long time to get into."
3,James@ RICHVIEW MIDDLE SCHOOL,This book is a very good book for some people but not for me. Nobody liked Vicky because they were smuggling drugs and dumping toxic waste. They didn't want anyone to know about what they were doing. So I suggest that you read it's a good book.
3,"""curiouser and curiouser...""","Putting aside the incredibly unrealistic plot (a teenage girl going to ANTARTICA of all places during the school year and getting caught in a web of international intrigue? I don't think so - L'Engle, what were you thinking?) I was moderately melted by the diverse and well-developed characters. I read ""A Ring of Endless Light"" in seventh grade, then eargerly got my hands on a copy of ""Troubling a Star"". Big mistake. It was nothing compared to its prequels, and it gave me a headache. I put it away, thinking that I'd understand it better if I read it a few years later. Well, at least I understand it, even if I don't like it.Bottom line: Don't bother with this one; L'Engle, thanks for trying, but next time try a little harder, okay?"
1,boring book,I had to read it for school. I think its one of the most boring books I've ever read. I'd almost fallen asleep a couple of times because it was so boring. I would not recemend this for anyone...
4,good...,"this book is good, but not great. as usual vicki is beingcourted (followed?) by a group of boys when she is asked to go toantarctica w/ adam. it a worthy read, but it gets a while to get into."
3,The L'Engle introspection is alive and well!,"In this typically L'Engle book fraught with the struggle between good and evil, Vicky Austin (Meet the Austins, The Moon by Night, A Ring of Endless Light) participates in a coming-of-age trip to Antarctica, where she gets emeshed in a dangerous and political struggle for power. As a previous reviewer said, the enigma of the plot seems to drag on and on, and is then wrapped up in the last 10 pages (how Hamlet-esque), but that quality is the book's only fault. The description of Antarctica is vivid and powerful (it's obvious that Miss L'Engle visited it firsthand), and the Vespugia controversy, while somehow not believable, performs its function to the plot entirely satisfactorily. While this book somehow lacks the utter poetry of A Ring of Endless Light (which has its own unrealities, at the same time), it is still an entirely satisfying L'Engle book."
3,"Good, but not her best","Being a huge L'Engle fan, I was very excited to read her most recent book, but was disapointed by it's quality. The story was excellent -- a cross between mystery, romance, and adventure on the high seas. The writing itself, however, seemed to be lacking. Unlike her other novels, Troubling a Star seemed to be written in a much simpler style, yet with the same young adult content. The dialogue was trite and made the protagonist, Vicky, seem like a very foolish child. I would recomend it only to the most avid L'Engle fans. To everyone else -- try Ring of Endless Light or Moon By Night."
3,Not bad but could've been a better selection of Songs!!,"Ok, the way I see it--either I'm getting old or Salsa is getting a different sound to it's beat. Those two first cut's should have never made it to the CD itself--come on, Cuba Libre? I really hope to see my Cuban brother's get their freedom but to sing about it ? No doubt that Tito Rojas and Victor Manuelle make this CD kick. Hope to see a ""The Best of Salsa en la Calle Ocho"" CD in the year 2000."
3,yummy but dangerous,These taste great...maybe too great. If you eat more than a couple you will experience tummy side-affects which are not fun. So show restaint and you will be fine.
3,"I thought that ""The TV Kid"" was a pretty good book.","I thought that ""The TV Kid"" was pretty good book overall. But I also thought that that the book was left on one spot too long. Maybe 2/4 of the book was left on the part where he was in the E.R. It was pretty exciting, and there was a good lesson in the end of the book."
2,"In my opinion, this was not a very interesting book.","This book was not very interesting. I couldn't find a real plot in this book. The book has only 3 things to happen: The boy watches too much TV, he gets bitten by a snake, and he finally stops watching TV."
1,Ech,"When I was in elementary school, Betsy Byars was one of my least favorite authors, and it's not hard to see why based on this book (admittedly not one of her best). The book doesn't even go anywhere-- I agree with one of the previous reviewers that it just goes from Kid Loves TV to Kid Gets Bit By Snake to Ending That Doesn't Resolve Anything At All. I'm pretty sure that she just forgot to resolve the plot-- or maybe that's just her writing style. Whatever."
2,Promising but disappointing,"Despite its rich writing and superb capture of Dublin idiom, this book is ultimately quite disappointing. It tells the story of a dysfuctional family with two alcoholic parents from the perspective of one of the young daughters, Tatty. Each chapter brings us forward a year in Tatty's life. Much of the narrative rings true but it stretches credibility somewhat that from chapter one, and at a very early age, Tatty is focussed on alcohol as being the main underlying problem with her family. Surely such realisation would dawn more gradually. Throughout, I felt that the anti-alcohol message (and there can be no doubting that children and alcohol should never be mixed) was the book's raison d'etre and this engendered a somewhat self-consciously self-pitying attitude in Tatty's narrative. Unfortunately, the book wears its heart too much on its sleeve."
4,Great Item!,"I purchased this item at circuit city in late december. I had also looked at the toshiba 7"" 1700(?), and i picked this one because of the cheaper price, and the bigger screen.The screen is great, and the controls are so easy to use. I find the speakers good, and i haven't had any problems with the headphone jack.I've hooked it up with the tv cables that come with it and its amazing the quality that comes with such a tiny machine.The only negative things are that the full-screen/wide-screen settings are little strange to swtich back and forth from, and when the dvd is loading, it does make some noise, but i think that is probably normal.Overall, it's fabulos, i haven't hand any serious problems wiht it for the 3 1/2 weeks i've had it, and i recommend it to any one who wants a good portable dvd player, but is on a low budget."
1,Garbage - Screen dies after just a few movies,"The screen went blank after about playing around twenty movies. There is sound, but the screen is just black. This flaw is consistent with other viewers comments. I will avoid all Liquid Video products in the future."
2,BEWARE OF THIS PLAYER!!!,"We purchased one of these last year. The screen went blank three weeks into owning it. We took it back and exchanged it with another one of the same models. It worked well until this weekend. At one year, its screen went blank too. The manufacturer warranty expired two months ago. No one here will repair it. So, it is money down the drain... Beware!"
3,"Great songs, inaccurate packaging","The music merits 5 stars and are well worth having. (Listen carefully to the lyrics of ""Ain't That A Mess."") That being said, there are major mistakes and omissions in song identification of which you need to be aware before purchasing:-The first song is incorrectly attributed to Connie McLean's Rhythm Blues when it is actually Kokomo Arnold;-Speckled Red's ""Dirty Dozens"" is not on this CD, so all but the last of the titles/artists need to shift up one;-Song 24 is ""Stew Meat Blues"" by Lucille Bogan, and is not credited anywhere on the CD."
5,"Finest kind of reading, entirely satisfying and more","This is the kind of book most of us wish for -- full-bodied, rich, superbly writen, entirely perfectly imagined, mighty tasty and more. Randall does world creation better than most. I just wish there could be more books like this one these days. So, I'm after Randall's ""Journy"" which is said to be a precurser of ""Dangerous Games."" Can't wait!"
5,At Last!,"I can't tell you how glad I am to find this video. Finally they have made a program just for women that goes into detail and shows very clearly the technique used to treat specific areas for specific ailments. It's a bit more advanced than other videos I've seen, but that is a good thing. The little drawings accompanying the demonstrations are also a great help so you can see exactly the place to work on while she is working. Even though she is working outdoors, which gives it a bright and airy feeling, the photography is excellent and you get a clear view of everything. If I could only have one video about reflexology, this would be it!"
1,CRAPPY SHIPPING FROM THIS PLACE,THIS IS PLACE OFFERED THE WORST SHIPPING EVER. THEY SHIP WHEN THEY WANT TO AND THEN IT'S VIA DHL. I WILL NEVER USE AGAIN.......
4,"Fine, but...","This book is well-written and factual. However, I thought I was buying a novel. I was sadly mistaken. Also, much of the book does not actually revolve around the events of Uhtred and Cnut in 1016. It's still worth reading, though."
2,TALKING ZOMBIES????????,"I've seen this movie at the store for quite a while but was afraid to buy it. The only reason why I bought was becasue it's a Lucio Fulci film. To be honest I was expecting a lot more. The one thing I hated was the fact that the zombies instead of eating people right away, they fight their victims!! (Kung Fu Zombies) by the way some of them talk too, actaully there is a DJ zombie! and there is hardly any gore. If you want good zombie action, stick to the basics: ""Night, Dawn, Day of the Dead"" and ""Zombie"""
1,Crap.,"This is one of the worst movies ever made - and I usually love zombie movies.Acting - terrible. Script - even more terrible. Effects - horrid.Lots of scenes with 'fog' on the ground, and you can even see the guy on the set, holding a smoke machine behind a building, creating the fog.Awful! Spend your money elsewhere."
3,A Fantastic Piece of Crap,"If you enjoy horror films that are real pieces of crap, then this is right up your alley. Cheesy effects, music, acting, and dialogue are all present with this shrink rapped turd. Don't waste 20+ dollars, it's included in a zombie pack from Shriek Show...also you can usually find a used copy rather cheap. The music makes the troops horny, they push some zombies down and evade crappy dialogue vomited from the mouths of the lively zombies. It's crap, it's fun, and if you like garbage along the lines of Neon Maniacs or Nightmare City then get this rediculous piece of crap."
3,zombi 3,"The worst zombie movie ever ? no that would go to zombie lake. this movie had good gore, okay zombies (except for the flying head) and creepy enough atmosphere. as far as chessey horror movies go this was not bad."
2,Am I reviewing the right film??,"It gets confusing. Zombie 1 is actually Zombie 2, and Burial Ground is actually Zombie 3, or something like that?Anyway, I am reviewing the one by Lucio Fulci. I don't know why, but City Of The Living Dead (aka The Gates Of Hell) is one of my hidden guilty pleasure all time favorite film. So, I have a morbid curiosity about Fulci films. I do like The Beyond, even though my DVD is called ""The 7 Doors Of Death"" (confused yet?)All I can say about Zombie 3 is, Fulci, what the heck happened? It is awful! The only thing I can say on a positive note is he can make the daylight look creepy in every film, and he did it in this one too...but man it bites!!'Burial Ground' was loads better than this..I recommend that one instead."
3,Zombi 3 : Something to hvae fun with,"Many people enjoy ripping on this film... and hell, I dont blame them at all. It definetly is one of the worst zombie films ever made. It is something to laugh at and have fun with, though. I like this movie solely for entertainment value and how laughable and silly it really is. Dawn of The Dead is my all time favorite film... I love fulci's Zombie and I currently own about 20 zombie films. Im a gigantic fan of the sub-genre... and I still find this to be sub-par. I dont think anyone should really take it seriously. I dont blame Fulci for walking out on it. I still reccomend this film and Zombie 4 if you want an entertaining, low-budget zombie film that you can laugh at."
1,Glad I rented it first!,"I remember seeing this movie in a video store. So, I decided to rent it. All I can say is, I'm so glad I rented it, first. This movie was such a waste. Nothing at all what I expected. After I saw this movie, I kicked myself for even wasting the money to rent it. But, had I bought it. I would have been really mad. It's not even worth renting! Everything is bad in this movie. You name it. It was bad."
3,It worked for me. But I'm no zombie afficianado.,"Directed by Lucio Fulci as a kind of sequel to his hit, Zombi2. A scientist in the Philippines accidently creates a serum that turns people into zombies. It's stolen by terrorists and yadda, yadda, yadda, everyone is turning up zombies. Enter the gun happy military! Highlights include a funky narrative provided by a groovy DJ, zombie birds and a zombie birth! This one is good, zombie-flavored fun."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOTTOM OF THE BARREL GORE JUNK!!!!!!!,"i love gore movies and i am willing to over look alot of things when watching one,but this is just the worst! not even the gory can cover up the weak production that they have given us here!!! save your movie and buy ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WASTE OF FILM,"Zombi 3-I couldn't wait to see this...and than I saw it. AWFUL-what a disgrace to have Fulcis' name associated with this joke of a film. Maybe if I dropped a tab of acid before hand, it would be OK. I couldn't wait to buy, now I can't wait to auction it off. See Zombie instead."
1,Worst Film Ever!,"If you don't believe that this piece of garbage is the worst film ever, then you should have your head examined. The acting is horrendous, the special effects could have been done better by a young Rick Baker and the location (the philipines) is very boring. There is nothing at all to watch in this film, I like zombie films just like the other guy but this is boring. The fight scenes between the zombies and the humans drags on, if you can imagine some scrawny little philipino wearing rubber slime on his face, that is the zombie. Predictable ending, everything is bad. Grade: F"
2,"Terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE!","Great cover art and the fact that it's (allegedly) a sequel to ZOMBIE got me interested in this really, really awful movie. Not even much fun on a cheese level, it's just really pointless and seems like they weren't even trying. There were two worthwhile scenes, 1) one of the lead characters is stuck at some resort building where he falls into a large pool. The air is filled with smoke and several zombies slowly emerge. Kind of creepy, it brought to mind all the directorial talent in ZOMBIE that somehow flew the coop here, and 2) the scene with the zombie head in the fridge that flies out and bites somebody. Hilarious! In fact, that one scene is so funny it's almost worth getting the DVD just for that. Actually, no, nevermind. Terrible!"
3,"completely inane, but not without credit","Yes. This movie [is bad]. But if you look beyond that you see that it's at least a decent effort. The special effects are horrid and the zombies have to be infected with bipolar disorder along with that toxic disease. Some run and some shamble, I guess it depends on what sort of mood your undead cadaver happens to be in. The soundtrack is pretty cool, and it's not every day that you see a flying zombie head (great scene... horribly made... but still great)."
3,a LUCIO FULCI film,"Hello Everyone,I'am a zombie movie fanatic. i love all zombie movies, especially the Italian zombie films because they're much more gorier. I was lucky enough to find this movie in a mama & papa store. I don't think anyone will be able to find rent this movie on VHS unless you live in Europe or Italy. Well anyway, this is a movie that equates itself to all the other Italian horror zombie movies such as Nightmare City, Hell of the Living Dead, Tombs of the Blind Dead, Zombie, the Beyond, City of the Living Dead, Zombie Holocaust, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, Burial Ground, and the George A. Romero's films. Part of this movie was directed by LUCIO FULCI and the rest was directed by some other director. Lucio Fulci withdrew from the film because he was dissatisfied with the film. In any case, this was a good film. The only difference is that the zombies in this picture have alot of energy, they move about like regular humans. The movie is not as gory as Lucio Fulci's Zombie film though."
3,discontinued model why so much,This model has been replaced twice over by newer models from uniden. I have had mine for around 7-8 years.The newer models arent this much. It's been a good radio.
5,devotional,"5 acoustic pieces involving singing and chanting, acoustic guitars, tablas, bongos and finger cymbals, in praise of Amma. The final track is a 12 minute 1200 year old Sanskrit hymn performed Dinosaur Jr-style. A sublime album. Music by and for grown-ups."
1,Question....,"Would you like to hear a J Mascis album with ten minutes of ""Ahh - Amma - Hey - Amma - Ahh - Amma - Hey - Amma......"" repeated over and over, sung by someone other than J Mascis?And have it be the best song on the album?I kid you not....those are the only lyrics in this song. The rest of the album is almost as repetitive.I really don't know what J was thinking here. I'm worried about him now. Is he in a cult?"
4,"Great product, quick ship!","This book came when promised and in the condition described in the details. Great reference, I use it all the time to help in my writing and when I am proofing other's work as well. Super useful book!"
5,Verdi Il Trovatore,I found the production to be great and the sound very much to my liking. The cast and singing quality very clear andeasy to follow.
3,Got the smell out but....,"This worked good for getting the smell out. On the flip side I followed the directions exactly and when I cut my AC on I had about 3 cup fulls of liquid come rushing out of my passenger vent straight on to my fuse panel below. Not good, I think this should come with better instructions otherwise the product was okay. I talked with a friend of mine who is chief mechanic for a Haynes Chrysler dealership and he said they would have never used the cleaner as you are directed on the instructions and that it was setting you up for a failure."
1,Beware!!!!!!!,"Beware! After using this product as directed it caused major problems. A small amount of ""liquid"" product leaked from duct on internal ecm and short circuited car electrical system. Major repair bill!! Do not use!"
1,At least it smells good.,"First off, would like to say that my 2009 Scion XB had a pretty good case of mold due to the drain line getting clogged this hot summer, and me not knowing what to do about it (From everything I have read online, this seems to be a problem with Toyta products... too bad I found this out too late in the game!). When I finally figured out how to get the water out, the evaporator was pretty infested with mold. I tried this product, and followed the directions to the letter. Unfortunately, the only thing that happened is that it masked the mold smell for about 2-3 weeks. Looks like I'm going to have to take the car to the dealer or a repair shop, have them disassemble the whole system, and clean it out with bleach to get all th mold out. Don't waste your money if your mold problem is bad!"
2,Just doesn't work,"I used this in my 2006 dodge ram in yet another attempt to remove a mildew smell from my HVAC system. I actually injected 1/2 of the bottle in the drain hole and the other half in the vent. I believed this way would be better as the foam could expand from both the bottom and top of the evaporator and, therefore, be more likely to get it clean. I used the entire can to treat my vehicle and followed all the package instructions. This stuff does have a somewhat pleasant lemon scent. Took about 5 days of running the blower fan full blast with the windows down during my daily commute to get the lemon scent from the stuff to subside to a tolerable level. However, after about 10 days after application, the mildew smell is back and now I have lemon scented mildew. Clearly the stuff didn't work. I wouldn't buy it again. It gets 2 stars only because the smell was decent."
2,Only cleaner and there is no spray tube.,I donot know whether it is working good or not.But this item is different from this picture.I received this cleaner without spray tube and top.How do I use it?
2,Good try but did not work in our smelly SAAB,Bought two cans of this stuff. First used half before and half after the evap. Still stunk! Tried second car but it too did not work.
2,this stuff sucks,"the propellant ran out before the can was empty, didnt even begin to fill the evap box, so did not have the desired effect, which was to clean the crud out of the evaporator fins.The real deal, I found out, is called frigi-clean, and it did get it frig-in clean! (to the tune of $40)"
3,Didn't work for my boat AC.,"Despite having full access to my evaporator coil, the product didn't eliminate the odors in my boat AC. I'll try in my car"
2,Mediocare,"The cap does not fit well, the content does not work well in eliminating ordorThe long tubing is the only good feature"
4,Exactly what you want,"Works exactly as promised to get rid of that ""gym sock"" smell....just be careful to spray, then wait a minute for the foam to slide down a bit, then spray more, etc and let it sit for like 30 mins or it will go all over when you turn on the AC."
5,Great,"Works great. Fresh smell after application! Be sure to look for the ""soft tube"" in the package that comes with the spray. You HAVE to use the tube to apply it! And also, turn off your A/C and just blow cool/warm air for a few minutes before you shut the engine, to prevent bad ordor from growing in your car."
3,"Worked for a while, BUT....","I am starting to smell the mildew once again, so it may be a temporary thing in my case. Ill wait till spring and retreat if nessesary."
1,Poor Design Results in Torn Straps,"I received this bag in late January, and have used it three times since then. Unfortunately, while I like the look and overall design of the bag, there is a substantial design defect with respect to the back straps. The lower anchor points for both straps have torn completely away. The straps are sewn into material that could never be expected to support the weight of a bag carrying any normal laptop, destroying the utility of what might have been a rather nice bag."
2,"Decent space, poor design","I see I am not the only one to notice that the straps are tearing off. This is a design flow and not a defect on the one that I bought. It did last me about 1 year, but if I were to chose again I would select something else (probably not Kensington)."
5,Sound Advice Based on Strong Research and Common Sense,This is the first book on heart health that I have read that makes the most logical sense and is the most uncomplicated to follow to improve overall health as well as strengthen the heart.
5,I couldn't put this book down - fantastic stuff!,"If you have a weight problem, high blood pressure, high cholestral, diabetes, heart problems or a high probablity of getting either of these conditions this is a MUST read book. It is written in easy to understand language, covers all the things your doctor doesn't tell you and gives you clear strategies to over come the health challenges mentioned above. It is very practical, with clear summaries and action steps.It has a focus on a high protein diet, low carbs and the use of selected food types and nutritional supplements and the PACE exercise program to achieve outstanding outcomes. Results are all clinically proven.Frankly, I consider this book a must read for everyone and I have immediately adopted the strategies and recommndations in this book.Highly recommended."
3,Very good for those with CVD,"This book is written by a cardiologist who practices successfully in Florida and now keeps many of his patients out of the hospital by supplementation, diet, meds if necessary, and exercise. His book isn't as thorough as Reverse Heart Disease Now by Sinatra and Roberts, but worth getting for his PACE exercise program. I haven't actually tried the PACE program (basically, interval training) and it is something you would slowly work up to if you have active heart disease, but it sounds like a great program."
3,Satisfied,"The book was very informative. However, with all the health and diet books I have read, they all seem to be similiar in many of the subjects. I just have to siphen out the parts that I believe and try to apply them in my daily life. It was very well written but like all books, you cant agree with everything. I was satisfied but not overwelmed. Thanks.Ron Caylor"
3,A Good Book for Beginners,"I did not learn anything that I didn't already know from this book. I am, however, one who is involved with continuous nutritional tune-ups and physical fitness. The advice and techniques are similar to those thatbody builders already use. As I said in my title, this is a good starter book and worthwhile as a startingpoint to better heart health."
4,funny but sadly true,"Hilarious! A chick looking for her husband, from ballroom dance classes to AA meetings with amusing results. Does she find him? I don't want to ruin the surprise! Suffice to say, along the journey, she realizes that whether or not she finds The Man, she can lead a fulfilling, rich life."
5,Hysterically Funny!,"A friend of mine had this book sitting on her coffee table and I opened it up and couldn't put it down. This is one of the funniest parodies I've seen in years. I was laughing out loud from beginning to end. Just when I thought I had the whole thing figured out, Carpenter would come up with another unexpected and delightfully amusing twist. I've bought four and am giving them as Valentine's gifts. Even my mother (married for 50 years!) loves it. Does anyone know who Rachel Carpenter is? Has she written other stuff? I searched her name on amazon and couldn't find other books but I'd sure love to read a novel if she's got one. Wow!"
2,"Wonderful Bowls, but price increase of $10 in 3 months.","I really loved these bowls, but there is a $10 price increase in 3 months. Less than 3 months. It makes it really difficult when people are trying to save and yet still purchase items they need in these days and times. Too bad."
5,"Ideal for dips, salsa, and cat food!","I love Stalkmarket products. We get the plates, the larger bowls, and these delivered regularly. These bowls have become a staple in my kitchen because they are the perfect size for so many things. They are ideal for dips, salsa, preparing ingredients, skimming fat off the top of broths, and cat food- especially on-the-go. I travel a good bit with our kitten and these bowls are the perfect size for her. I just empty her Fancy Feast into it or pour some water or dry kitten chow into them and she is all set!Very versatile, quite durable, and even with frequent use the 600 bowls will last year a good 7-9 months!"
5,Perfect for feeding the cats,"I bought these bowls to use as liners in the Corelle bowls I use to feed my cats. I got tired of scraping out dried wet food from my bowls, and if the food sat too long then flies would come.These bowls are the perfect size for holding one 5-6oz can of cat food, and since they're biodegradable they're eco-friendly too. They are smaller than regular cereal bowls, but they could be used as dessert bowls if you need them for humans :)Highly recommended - they've made my my life way easier!"
5,I'm sold on Stalkmarket!,"First, I love the Stalkmarket brand! The bowls hold hot liquids easily and, also, I love the eco-friendliness of the product. These little 7-ounce bowls are perfect for snacks for children and for prep bowls while cooking. Although the size of the bowl is very small, I find the bowls perfect for melting butter in the microwave. I've even used these bowls to hold hot grease. Another great use is for portion control with desserts! I'm keeping a ready supply of these bowls and I suggest that you do so, too. Buying in advance (subscribe and save) and in bulk like this helps me stay on track as far as doing my part for the environment!"
4,"Loved it, could have been longer!","Typical Hannah Howell. Haven't read one of her books that I didn't like. I'd like to see less description of the sex, though."
2,Ho-Hum,I just didn't care for this book. I usually like Hannah Howell's books. The scene and characters were superficial and way too drawn out. I was very disappointed.
5,My Valient Knight,"I really enjoyed this book, though I am kinda biased because I love Hannah Howell's books."
1,BIG MISTAKE!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS NOVELA BECAUSE OF ITS STARS AND THE STUDIO NAME.UNFORTUNATELY I'M VERY SAD TO SAY I WAS WRONG BIG TIME!!!!!I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST OR ONE OF THE FIRST VENEVISION NOVELAS SHOT IN MIAMI.WHY?LETS JUST SAY IT WAS VERY VERY CHEAPELY DONE:FROM INTERIORS TO EVERYTHING ELSE.ACTING WAS TERRIBLE(IM VERY SAD TO SAY MARIO CIMARRO WAS JUST AWFUL,IT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST ACTING JOB).A TERRIBLE NOVELA.......I WOULD GIVE 0 STARS......."
1,Not Full Length,Beware. I was expecting a full length video of at least 45-50 minutes. This lasts 25. Perhaps Amazon should include the time so buyers do not have a nasty surprise.
3,Quite a year,"The year 1876 was a landmark year, to be sure: the Philadelphia Centennial took place, Custer encountered his Last Stand, and the fraudulent Tilden-Hayes Presidential election took place, among other newsworthy events. Brown deals with these events and then some, all in a somewhat cursory way, but is mostly concerned with the Centennial and the election. The book is no more than a fairly routine popular history, the year chosen ultimately to highlight the Bicentennial in 1976."
4,"Funny, even if you are not a librarian","First, full disclosure: I am not a librarian, but I have seriously considered studying to become one, and all my 1500 books are Dewey decimalized, and have been since I was about 10 years old. So I may perhaps be a bit biased, but this book is very funny, even to a non-librarian. I checked it out from my local public library today and started reading it in the parking lot. I had finished reading it before I left the parking lot. And I noticed that the place was empty; the library had closed and the lot had cleared out while I read and laughed unawares."
1,Unshelved Should Never Be Shelved in Anyone's World,"Length:: 1:19 MinsOkay, watch this before forking over much needed money for crack. If you have a horrible sense of humor, please keep quiet and laugh along with those that are actually funny. Don't purchase a volume of Unshelved and remove all doubt that you are humor challenged needing medical help."
3,"Good, but nothing really new...","I saw a new album out by these guys this year, figured I'd check out their first cd before buying the new one. It's alright. The riffs are stylistically right between In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, keyboard stylings similar to older dark Tranquillity... but it's all been done before. The vocals were the real disappointment. There's virtually no deviation from the near cookie-monster grumbles. I don't mind small bursts, but you gotta mix it up to keep it interesting--this guy is near monotone! I think this album will appeal to metal purists--it's really conservative though, I don't see why magazines gave it such great reviews."
2,Disappointing,This book is more about Robert Lee Morris than his jewelry. It contains more images of RLM than his jewelry. I returned the book.
5,Robert Lee Morris: The Power of Jewelry,"This book was a Valentine's Day present for my wife. She absolutely loved it. The shipping, service and follow-up from the seller was superb. I would definitely buy from this seller again without hesitation.Robert Lee Morris: The Power of Jewelry"
3,good starter,First one of Joan Hohl's that I read and could not wait to find others. It is a good starter story (for me) if you haven't tried a J Hohl or A Lorin try to find one. She has improved as her other works show. The best ones of all time are T's/Way and T's/wife.
1,rayman games,"These games,sold in a set are obsolete as they are only good with older systems, and have not been upgraded to be used with any of the later versions of Windows, which are no longer in operation. I was totally disappointed in this purchase, as my children and myself were very satisfied in the past with any of the Rayman games, and expected them to be the same. It would help people be satisfied with these games if they would upgrade them to work with XP and after.Edith Botticello"
5,Love this,I have always loved to read about angels ! I know they exist and watch over us. I want to think mine is with me at all times. Great read to me
2,Better options available,"I found this book remarkably unhelpful. It was often maddeningly difficult to figure out which map went with which walk, and the walks were not described very clearly. Once I got to Scotland, there was a wealth of great walking books available everywhere, including the wonderful Cicerone guides, and the Pathfinder series published by the Ordinance Survey company, maker of the great topo maps in the UK. I ended up leaving my Lonely Planet guide in a cafe (on purpose), and using my newly purchased local guidebooks instead. The Cicerone and Pathfinder books are available on Amazon, and I highly recommend you skip the Lonely Planet and use these other books."
4,Great tool,Explains very thouroughly how to do things. Only frustrating thing is even though it explains well it always says if you aren't trained you shouldn't do it. Oh well for do it at home.
4,Monitor does its job,"This monitor is very easy to use. The only problem is the awkwardness of the tubing to the cuff. The cuff does store in the back compartment very nicely.The readings appear to be accurate, as other reviewers have better confirmed."
1,Not accurate,"After giving me crazy readings, I finally took the machine with me to the Dr's office to calibrate it with their machines. The machine was totally off from readings at the Dr's office. I've always had good luck with Panasonic products, I think I just got a lemon with this one. Had to send it back."
5,WELL PLEASED AND EASY TO USE,"VERY SATISFIED WITH THE Panasonic EW3122S Upper Arm MONITOR... VERY EASY TO USE AND ACCURATE... ALSO, MY DOCTOR SAID IT WAS A GOOD PIECE OF EQUIQMENT..."
5,Better than I expected,"Well, I read all the pros and cons before buying it, and after using it for some times I am extremely pleased! It is heads and shoulders above the old device I bought at Walgreens, which had an inflation bulb I had to squeeze, showed errors four out of five times, and read extremely high. This is dead on and accurate!"
3,Nice but not perfect.,"I like the look and design of the product. It's compact easy to read, easy to use. But the nurse who checked its accuracy said that the top reading was way off and the bottom reading was ok. So while I like the look and use, I wouldn't be able to depend on it for accurate readings."
3,Inconsistent,I am not sure yet about this digital monitor. I suspect I have gotten much higher readings than normal. I have gone to mydoctors office and the mercury shows lower diastolic pressure.
4,Great,"Great product, accurate readings and easy to use, and easy to store. Perfect for everyday use. A bit pricey but worth it this far :-)"
2,Diasappointed with Panasonic Blood Pressure Monitor,"The readings are not reliable, and Panasonic telephone support is terrible. If they don't take care of your problem when you buy a $70 BP monitor, why would you even consider buying a $1700 big-screen TV from them?"
3,Automatic Digital BP monitors are not accurate.,"I recently did lot of research to buy a good automatic digital BP monitors. After trying out all the products on the shelf, here is my conclusion - None of the Non-Commercial grade automatic digital BP monitors are accurate. Even the mean value is no where near accuracy. Please buy a Mercury based one, train your partner/friend and get frequently tested. Most economical and accurate way of checking your BP.- San"
3,result different all the time,I don't know....it works alright.but the result does jump sometime. (in few seconds)
5,Great product,"Got this when a recent doctor visit revealed my wife had high blood pressure. This unit is very easy to use, and accurate (I tested it against the doctor's office). It has two memories; you can choose to enter your BP reading into memory 1, memory 2, or neither. It keeps track of the readings in each memory, and also gives an average of the readings in each memory.You won't need the optional A/C charger - the batteries work just fine and seem to last (We've done about 100 readings so far).It's actually a conversation piece when people come over - everyone wants their BP checked."
2,Bulky and Unreliable,"The systolic rate usually measured very low. The comfort cuff was very easy to use, and the other rate measurments appeared to be accurate. It is also larger than other units I have used. This unit comes with only batteries, and one must purchase the AC adapter separately. I am returning it because of the unreliable systolic reading."
2,TOO SMALL,"This would fit a newborn baby, not my 12 year old who wanted it based on the picture. Was nicely made for being so small."
3,Doesn't have a very soft feel to it.,"I don't know a lot about crocheting but, this cap doesn't have a soft feel to it like the other ones I have purchased recently have. I'm inclined not to give it as a gift, haven't made up my mind as of yet."
4,Warm,I wear these around the house to keep my head warm as I keep the thermostat low in the cold months. They work great.
2,Check measurements before you buy,"Way too small! Barely fits on an adult head, but fit my 2-year-old son perfectly!"
4,"Good product, very expensive shipping charges","The case is a very good fit for the Gigabeat, and the presumed EVA material provides great protection from accidental impact.The belt clip design is functional, but not so good.The value was very reasonable for the indicated price, but the shipping charges (from the Amazon affiliate supplier) of 3.5x the price were outrageous, and the shipping transit period was unreasonably long (10+ days)!"
3,Naruto adding to his Collection of High-Ranking Friends,"Naruto is building on his collection of friends; Action sequences, however, are really nothing new."
2,Not their best.,"I'm not going to say much about this, only that it really wasn't very good and I quickly got rid of the album. If you're new to the band, start with ""Diabolical Summoning"" or ""Cross the Styx."" Their newest album (2006) is supposed to be good as well. This one you might want to pass up."
1,Bad CD mastering.,"This is a fantastic album, but the sound has been destroyed in the process of making the CD. It sounds for all the world like an amateur dub of a worn LP, with a bad electrical connection somewhere in the audio chain.I checked previous LPs of this album, and they all sound FAR superior to this CD made by Wounded Bird Records.Checking the Wounded Bird website turns up a prominent disclaimer that all their CDs are properly licensed. I guess they have to say it, because you'd never know it from the quality of their product.This is a real shame because this is, like I said, a fantastic album. But I'd be far better off making my own CD of it using my own LP."
2,Could not read anymore.,"When I saw this book, I thought it would be wholesome and of good quality like many of the books on ML. Not so. I'm sorry if I offend anyone by this, but I have to say that Cheryl Landon is just saying what she overcame, and that her dad was just there for support. I guess that that's good, but, it dominated over the book, and nowhere in there did I see anything about a legacy being described. In fact, I got so disgusted with this book, I just stopped reading it and returned it to the library. I do not recommend this book at all, even though it was written by someone of Michael Landon's family."
1,"Don't bother, Michael Landon fans.","As a Michael Landon fan, I was totally disappointed in this book. Cheryl is riding on her father's name here. Her philosophy in this book has nothing to do with Michael Landon's legacy. After all the research I've done on him, I think he'd be disappointed with her far-fetched ideas. If this is the way she wants to live and believe, fine: If she wants to write a book about it, fine. But don't attribute it to Michael."
2,A sad widow,The musicians all perform very well. However the acting and scenery left me feeling that this was really a very sad widow; an elderly person who laments her past. There is little merry about this widow.
2,Disappointing,"This production felt more like musical theater done poorly than operetta. The costume on Anna as she sings the Vilia song is dreadful on her, and the quality of the singing overall is just so-so. Though not a terrible production, I expected better from San Fransisco."
1,too much,"This is a terrible WIDOW that is greatly overproduced. Whatever is enjoyable in it is destroyed by a overblown, gargantuan third act in which the kitchen sink could even fit. There is not a good WIDOW available on DVD yet"
3,Badly cast,"Sound quality is great, sets are fine, performers sing well, costumes are fine. But some roles are badly cast. We have a Frenchman who does act or sound French, a Spaniard who does not sound or act Spanish, a Russian woman who does not sound or act Russian, we have an Ambassador who acts like a silly teenage girl. And Danilo does not act like he was born to nobility/royalty, he acts like the neighborhood bully, so why would Anna want him? I will not buy another DVD that has Bo Skovhus in any role. And what is it with the Mad Hatter hats? Act III is suffocating with all red costumes. Choreography is poor. I still love the Sydney version of this operetta the best."
3,No English Sub=titles,The diction of the singers was not sufficient to permit satisfactory understanding the dialog and lyrics. Musically it was very pleasant and the staging was fine. The absence of English subtitles was a great disappointment
2,Not the performance of a lifetime,"Bought this disc on the recommendation of other rave reviews that said it was THE performance to have. I already own two other recordings of this opera, but they fall short in various ways and I was hoping that this one would be the definitive version. To date, none has equaled any of the live performances I've seen of this delightful operetta, nor featured the best libretto I've heard for it. This recording, in particular, was a disappointment, in that, not only were there were no really wonderful performances in this version, but none of the voices were even particularly good. The costumes and scenery were gorgeous, but in the end, it's the singing that has to excel, and with music like this that soars, it's extra disappointing when the voices don't match it. The lack of English subtitles, which I knew about prior to purchase, just adds insult to injury."
3,Needs English Subtitles,"While I understand that English is not the easiest language in which to sing, much of the text was virtually unintelligible. This production needs English subtitles."
4,Aren't there younger Widows too?,"From the 2 versions avalable on DVD(the other one being the Australian one with Joan Southerland) this seemed the obvious choice and I don't regret it.With so few operettas on DVD ,every release has to be saluted,especially if it's as good as this one.It has everything that an operetta needs-well sung,funny,great music,nice sets,and rich costumes. The video and audio are superb.Only 4 stars because there are no English subtitles and because I think a younger widow would have suited more to this kind of production.I recommend this production for everyone who is looking for a good entertainment."
1,Can't understand the words,It was completely disappointing as we couldn't understand the words. I have a CD recording if I just want to listen to the music. In a DVD it would be nice to have subtitles for English as well as any other language. Very rarely can language being sung be understood. After years in the SF Opera pit my husband does want to understand what is happening.
2,Whate a waste of scenery and costumes!,"I thought it would be impossible to ruin Lehar's The Merry Widow, but this production convinced me otherwise. The 2001 San Francisco Opera presentation excels in beautiful art deco stage sets; costumes are elegant to sarcastically lavish. It is a setting for a grand opera. Only The Merry Widow is NOT a grand opera: it is an operetta, a comedy, it is supposed to be light, funny, even frivolous. Unfortunately, this presentation is beset by show-off singing and exaggerated acting. Also, translation of Victor Léon and Leo Stein's libretto is wasted: it is very difficult to understand opera singers even under best circumstances, so the sensible way to present such work is in original language with translated text (on the programme for real-life opera, as subscript for video). For those who would enjoy the Viennese operetta, Placido Domingo's direction of Die Fledermaus will provide for a much more pleasurable experience."
5,FAST RESULTS!,"This video works great! I get sore every single time I do it! If you follow the instructions exactly how the video tells you, you really will see results within 3 weeks or so. I've tried other leg videos and they don't compare with this one! I love it! This was definitely worth buying ;)"
1,Overpriced for what is offered and for beginners,"The nutrition info is boring to watch and not very informative. The exercises are very basic and really are primarily meant for beginners. If you are an intermediate to an advanced exerciser, I would not recommend this video."
4,great workout,"I feel this one the next day....The first time that I did this workout...the whole video, my legs were sore for 4 days. It was hard to walk. After that I picked certain exercises to do and I still get sore but at least I can walk. It is a great video."
2,Really unprofessional,"After reading all of the positive reviews I was excited to try this DVD. Unfortunately it is cheaply made and the girl who leads the workout is almost unbearable to watch. They pick on an inexperienced girl throughout the whole video and now I can hardly stand to watch it. The exercises are useful, but the video is horrible."
3,Exercises themselves are good...,"I can see how you would definitely see results if you did this frequently, however the video itself is not super exciting. There is an instructor, one experienced person and one lady who has no experience and they point out the inexperienced lady's mistakes throughout the dvd. There are 10 exercises one right after another totaling 20 minutes that are all good exercises that really target the glutes and lower body, but there is nothing in between so it doesn't really flow. I will keep it and use it periodically, but not something I would enjoy on a day to day basis."
2,It didn't work,"We had high hopes for this professional-sounding adhesive. But after a week, the headliner was hanging loose again. Looks like we're off to the upholstry shop."
2,Shouldn't have repaired headliner myself,"I tried repairing the headliner while it was still in the car, and it didn't go very well. It was the headliner along the edge of the back window, so when I sprayed it, the glue would form droplets that trickled down to where the headliner was still attached, and they soaked through. Now the headliner has yellow glue splotches on it. Also, because it's a spray, it's hard to spray it evenly over all areas. So there are still areas that are detached. And I couldn't get all the bubbles out either. I should have just had it done professionally, which is what I have to do now to fix the mess I made."
4,Just Finished...Susanna Keeps Getting Better,"Susanna Carr's book Lip Lock was a good read. I usually can't find time to sit and read a novel for enjoyment but I was able to keep coming back to this one. I was disappointed that I figured out the ""whodunit"" at the point that Molly was fired, but the motive was interesting. The whole book was well-crafted and proof that Susanna gets better with each book. (""Sister Switch"" from ""Beach Blanket Bad Boys"" was choppy, rushed and not good at all.) I just bought ""Valentine's Day is Killing Me"" to read ""Valentine Survivor"" and I hope that it is as good as the teaser excerpt."
1,No more Vince = no more Motley Crue,"The music on this CD is flat and without feeling. Motley Crue has always been a good party band, but this CD does not show that side!! This is one CD I can say I will never play again."
4,"GOOD ALBUM-GRUNGE/METAL, NOT GLAM/HAIR","If you're looking for an album to listen to before a hair metal concert, do NOT listen to this one.This album fits perfectly into the mid-90s grunge metal scene. Tracks like ""Hooligan's Holiday"" and ""Misunderstood"" are probably deeper and more complex than anything else in the Crue catalog. Corabi's voice is deep and raspy, providing a good change from Neil's nasaly whine.Basically, when you listen to this album, it's like listening to a completely different band than Neil-Lee-Mars-Sixx. Try Alice in Chains meets Metallica meets Use Your Illusion GnR meets Motley Crue.Try it, you'll like it."
3,Experemental album,This is the disk that is very over looked bye the Crue fan. There is great drumming on it and the vocals are sharpe and razor edge. Its is heavy as hell. But it misses Vince. The song writing skills of John helped out Nikki alot. Its a cool album but not there best.
4,Metal 90's Style,"Although this CD doesn't cater to the traditional vocals of the Crue with Vince, it definitely proves the band can evolve with the times. Tampering on the borders of grunge, this CD exposes the Crue's life after the glam 80's."
2,Nothing like the picture,"The plant I got looks absolutely nothing like the picture-- there aren't any berries on it, and it small and weak and covered in moss. I'm very disappointed."
3,bait and switch! - sort of...,"i ordered this album a couple of days ago and it arrived with today's mail. kudos (and one star!) for fast delivery!however....the original vendor's listing for this album includes the cover as shown - which i was expecting - NOT some rehashed faux ""psychedellic"" cover so minus two and a half stars for a very misleading ""come on"" fotothe album itself is great - but as i was hoping to cop an ORIGINAL version and not this (possibly bootlegged?) version i'm only slightly satisfied.caveat emptor, baby, caveat emptor"
4,Who can you believe?,"This would be a great way to start a unit for upper elementary kids on media and truth in journalism. It's a visual delight, and has lots of details to spark further inquiry. While most kids today think they are pretty media-wise, can they indeed tell the difference between ""entertainment"" and ""infotainment?"" A fun visually engaging introduction to the ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast, might provoke some interesting conversations in the classroom."
4,Pretty good,"I stuffed this full of bedding for camping and carried it around, and, surprise! The handle pulled out. I was able to stick it back in and tie it, but then the other one pulled out. Fixed that. Just carried it without the handle. Don't overstuff it, don't rely on the handle for carrying, and it will be fine. Good for storage, not carrying around. You probably could have guessed that, right?"
5,funny and different too for scifi geeks and normal people,"scifi people are so darn picky and uptight as you see from the reviews here. the truth is this was the funniest scifi parody i have seen since hardware wars and this was really a lot funnier than that. the clay work was rough but still funny and the rest of it was really good. relax your insane expectations all you scifi geeks,, for the price this one is a keeper! whats wrong with fart jokes anyway? kids like that sort of thing and so did i. if you want a more sophisticated show go rent 2001 and go to sleep in ten minutes or for dark humor try pretending you're ""Data"" and have your friend play Picard with you in the basement."
3,"don't buy it, rent it","This video is kinda funny, but I would rather have it out of the house. Should have rented it ...or lived without it. Thumb wars is funnier and a better spoof on star wars."
2,A Good (Failed) Try,"It seemed like a great idea - to meld all the classic space operas into a short animated film parody. So what went wrong? The animation is crude but entertaining, but alas the story is leaden and the 'humor' can barely induce a snicker (and I tested this one on my ""hey, we'll laugh at anything"" gang). Watched it once, donated it to the library."
3,"CD & DVD Safe, But...","When I found out regular Sharpie markers are not recommended for use on CD/DVD discs, I started looking for one made just for them. I settled on this one, and it does write on the discs. Thing is, the makers say the ink won't bubble up on the disc surface. So far, when using the larger of the two tips, the ink does indeed bubble a bit, resulting in a less than solid line."
5,a very guilty pleasure,"This show originally aired when I was a senior in high school, and everyone watched it, but me. I did not want anything to do with some mtv reality show. Ironically enough... a few weeks ago I caught a rerun on mtv, and I was hooked. So I immediately felt compelled to buy the season. My biggest complaint it that it is sooo short. Just 9 twenty minute episodes (excluding the first 40 minute episode). The bonus disc is very nice though. It has deleted scenes from each episode, enough material to add about 20 minutes to each. As others have mentioned, more football footage would have been cool, but I thought there was a good balance between the students personal and athletic lives.I can now say I have finally been addicted to a reality show...just one that aired three years ago."
5,GREAT new B&D CD,Ronnie and Kix have done it again. This album has a nice blend of slow and upbeat songs. Ronnie Dunn continues to be the main stay as he does lead on the majority of the songs. Brooks and Dunn continue to put out hit album after hit album.thanks guys
2,Disappointiing,"I have loved every CD by Brooks & Dunn, but this one doesn't do much for me. Mainly, there are too many songs that are too slow; the thing I like best about these guys is their rockin', boot-scootin' honky tonk, and that's almost entirely missing here. Also, ""missin' You"" was a bad song when John Waite sang it and it's still a bad song. I hope next time B & D put out something better."
3,3 stars for Ronnie only!,"Ronnie Dunn's voice is the best country voice around. He is just great live or recorded.Every song on this CD he does is wonderful. Hey Ronnie, get rid of Kix. He has no talent and you would be better on your own."
1,"Yeeehah, Country Music Rocks!","My nephew gave this sucker to me as a gift. The day after I bought it, I roped a cow, changed the oil in my Chevy Tahoe, and payed bail to get the old lady out of jail. Thanks Neph!What a piece of crap. You mean to tell me people pay for this junk? God I hate country music on so many levels. Unfortunately the fans of this dribble wouldn't understand any of them."
4,Best in awhile,"B&D haven't put out anything captivating since album #2, but this CD has it's share of great songs. Even the Kix vocal songs are pretty good on this effort. Aside from the John Waite remake (which could have been left off entirely), this is a solid album, the best in awhile. Tracks like ""Hurt Train"", ""You'll always be loved by me"", and ""All out of Love"" are prime examples of what catapulted B&D to the top. Ronnie Dunn's vocals have never been better. A great CD if you're looking for a little less Honky-Tonk & Boot Scootin."
5,Tight Rope First Step in New Direction Awesome Album!!!,"I am a serious Brooks & Dunn fan and Tight Rope is equal to, if not better than some of their other albums. This album was definately a change of pace from previous albums, but it is a stepping stone towards what Brooks & Dunn accomplished on ""Steers & Stripes"" and ""Red Dirt Road"". Its true that none of the songs were co-written by the duo, but they each bring some unique material to the table and they are both amazing song writers. Ronnie's voice is flawless as always, but Kix also steps it up on this album and I think that his songs are a nice contrast to Ronnie's. If given more opportunities I think some of Kix's songs could shine as singles, but he is willing to let Ronnie sing on songs that have a good chance of being hits.Anyone out there who has liked Brooks & Dunn will enjoy this album. Ignore the critics and make up your own minds as to what is a good record and what isn't. If you don't own this album you need to buy it."
3,Mediocre at best,"This CD would not make them superstars - lackluster, boring....Do yourself a favor, if you are a fan, buy a used one ..., just to have it in the collection."
5,Excellent natural cures with detailed execution instructions,"I didn't realize that the book wasn't solely about clay healing, as it covers herbal treatments, also, and at first I was disappointed. Then, I started to read it, and the clay remedies are very detailed and form an extensive part of the book. I am happy with it."
5,earth cures drugs dont,"All I can say is read this book and follow it to the letter and you will not need a doctor, we have followed the guide line in this book and we dont need the drugs to keep us going.We have been back to our doctor and blood test have shown that by following the book we have the right out come in stead of using drugs which have side affects."
4,Even better than their earlier stuff,"This album is full of upbeat, very danceable songs. They are all funky, cool, and fun! It's an excellent album, and I don't know why it didn't get more play time. Fun to just listen to or party with."
5,How do you say...DEEE-GROOVEY!!!,"This cd is a definate change from the two previous Deee-lite cds, but it is in my opinion the best. Lady Kier shows us once again that she is the master of Sampladelic delivery and her voice is put to much better use here than on her previous efforts. Sadly this was their last cd (expect for the remix cd) and I am dying to hear some new stuff. Lady Kier, please release a solo album (your Deee-lite band members can accompany you on some songs as well)! Your Party Happening People are waiting..."
5,This music is charismatic!,"I wonder if Lady Miss Kier started this band, or DJ Dimitry. But this music; it's exactly what you would hear in a dance club. I bet ""Bittersweet Loving,"" ""Say Ahhh..,"" and ""River of Freedom"" would be played constantly. The beats, the vocals, the night. Oh, it's just..baaad. I Love It!!!! P.S. Lady Kier can sing like nobody's business."
5,"Mushrooms, caterpillars. Dewdrops in the garden.","I defy you to find a better dance album anywhere. Start to finish, this CD is superb."
2,lots of filler between the good songs,"Don't be deceived by Amazon's description of this 3-disc set -- there's no Jazz Butcher or Alien Sex Fiend here. I frankly don't know why those two bands are named in connection with this album. The songs collected here loosely fit into the genre of punk-rockabilly, but the quality of the cuts is extremely variable. Some of the songs are inspired -- but more of them are not. You're better off just buying a Cramps album."
5,GREAT FUN!!! LOVE IT!,"GREAT FUN!!!! I bought this DVD set sight unseen because I like Damon Wayans and Tisha Campbell-Martin. ( I've always like Tisha Campbell-Martin since she was in ""House Party"" )I really enjoyed this set and look forward to buying the second season."
5,my wife &kids season 1,this is a great funny dvd of a great comedy show and if you want to laugh this is a great one
3,Very funny,"This season of My Wife and Kids is a lot of fun, but don't expecto to receive 22 episodes, there were only twelve episodes in this season, for this it receives just 3 stars."
1,Shame and disgrace!,This show is an affront to decent family values and yet another mockery of African-American families. I struggle to understand why anyone feels the need to support the Wayans clan in yet another dud!
4,Past and present story of love,"Yesterday's Love was truly an inspiring story of love from the past, blended with love from the present. Karilea has a true gift for writing and making the characters come to life. It was a wonderful story and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Yesterday's Love Is Like Melting Directly Into A Victorian Painting,"Could not put this book down...to me and for me, very spiritual in a metaphysical sort of way...which seems obviously the backbone of this sensitive and fascinating novel. It's impassioned with a consistent spinning wheel of a lover's mystery...keeping nostalgia alive, content with thoughtful places that you can hear, touch and feel for yourself. Excellent substance...in a relaxed manner, feeding constant messages, essential information, just enough to impatiently turn to the next page....there was no substitute for the peace this book made me feel...so much so, couldn't pick up another book for quite some time, wanted to. I'm a push over for paranormal, and the translations this book sings is simply up close and delicate. I had a good time in this eclectic period of time.PS This was a five star rating, something went wrong?"
3,A good first start ...,"... on the history of Black Women in the world. The author basically brainstormed many facts to the reader. Nearly all were fascinating and interesting.However, Sharp, fails to provide an adequate bibliography, footnotes or other sources for her facts and quotes. Also, she included too many sarcastic captions (via comic book fashion) which were very degrading to Black Women (and the crass language was not appreciated either). For these 2 reasons, I give this book only 3 out of 5 stars.The author has wonderful information but did not treat the subject of Black Women in world history with the respect and sacredness it deserved. Nevertheless, the book is a good start. I recommend with hesitation. For immediate follow-up: a better, more scholarly book is Ivan Van Sertima's Black Women in Antiquity."
5,Black women for begginners ****,"this was the perfect gift and a book that was long seeked for by my girlfriend, she was very excited when i surprised her with it a week after she told me about running across it at a friends home. Excellent book with invaluable infromation."
4,Fun,Good song selection' OK graphics. All disk work well no dud disk. We have had hours of fun singing. Highly recommend it.
4,Elvis Karaoke Pck,Arrived in good condition within stated time. I did not read the ad correctly as I was expecting a box with perhaps words to the songs. Never the less I received the cd's in white paper sleeves as is listed on the sellers ad. Knowing there were no words on paper would have been helpful.
3,Not bad for poor master discs,"This concert is an interesting one. Seems there was a radio broadcast for the first segment of the concert, followed by a regular concert. I have to say though, that this recording seems to be incidental, and poorly executed. The microphones could have been placed better by a chimpanzee, as the vocals are almost completely inaudible, along with Duke's introductions. The radio announcer even, is very muted. Nonetheless, the music is not bad at all and this period of Duke's work is somewhat obscure in comparison to his earlier and later work. Not a bad concert for those of us who are historically minded. Just dont expect anything even remotely close to the jazz-nirvana perfection of the Newport '56 Re-Issue set."
5,bct8 scanner,"great scanner for beginners like me. delivery was excellent. simple but broad ranged scanner great if you want to plug in and start receiving. open scan started pulling local stations without any programing. buy it and keep an eye on you're public servants, or should i say an ear."
4,Scanner Review,"It looks like the device may have been a returned item which I didn't realize when I bought it. The box had been taped shut. However, everything was there that needed to be and it works fine.Sound quality is good and it is exactly what I wanted. No complaints with it at all."
1,snoopy,"outdated and pretty well useless, unless you are wanting cities and counties that are still in the stone age. should not have purchased."
4,Exactly what I expected...,"The BCT8 is an easy to use, feature rich, and affordable scanner. It does exactly as promised. It gets great reception, even in my basement that's 5-6 feet below grade. I use it primarily for Fire/Rescue, although I do occasionally listen in to the police chatter in my area on the 800mhz. Programing was simple enough, about what I expected it to be. All in all, I have no complaints. I would definitely recommend it for the application in which I use it (as a desktop scanner). I can't comment on using it as a mobile application. Hope this is helpful."
3,good expect,I received it on time however could not set it up. The instructions were not very good ..I am glad I had a friend to could put the numbers in for me and once that was done it works very good for what I wanted it for. Make sure you know how to set them up if you order this product.
2,Beware of the loud beep...,"Apparently Uniden thinks that the loud beartracker beep when powering the unit on is a needed feature? I really like the scanner but can not continue to live with this loud beep every time that I turn the unit on. I did contact Uniden, the beartracker beep can be muted once the unit is on by pushing and holding down the MUTE button for 2 seconds. The only downfall is that when you turn it off, then turn it back on again next time, you will have to experience the start up beep and then will have to re-mute it again. I checked over at radio reference and there doesn't appear to be a solution to this. I will be returning it and purchasing a different make/model. I wish I had known about this ""feature"" before purchasing this scanner."
3,Poor documentation,The documentation for the BCT8SS software is worse. To program your BCT8 check out ARC8 from BuTel.
1,instructios,"Have still not been able to program this the way it should be, confusing controls instrucitons, complicated, not at all like my old scanner, cannot find a way to check to see what frequencies are stored in the scanner, would look for a diferent scanner that is more user friendly."
5,Police scanner,"I ordered this scanner for my husband and he loves it. We were able to find the codes online for our police, fire, and ambulance here in our town as well as the sheriff's department in our county. By listening to this we are aware of where accidents or fires have happened so we can avoid those areas."
1,Big dissapointment!,Ordered this radio in September of 2011. Have always been a fan of Uniden products but this radio totally misses the mark both in radio quality and the customer service I received from Uniden in trying to correct the problem. Here it is July of 2012 and the radio is basically useless for trunked operation. Audio is very garbled and flutters. 5% of the time it is clear audio. Must be a temperature issue but they have not solved the problem. Uniden refuses to give me a new one. I am now an EX-Uniden fan.
5,Worth the money.,"I've had this scanner for a week now and it still surprizes me. When on a road trip I picked up my local police from 50 miles from my town. My other scanners don't pick them up after about 10 miles. It's also compatable with ECAS Trunked System, which is the main reason I baught this scanner. It also gets rid of the anoying beeps at the end of each trasmission of the fire and police. Also great feature is the conectivty of the scanner to your computer makes programing very easy. I would recomend this scanner for any beginner or advanced radio scanner listener."
3,Works,Scanner works well. Only problem I have is very hard to setup. Had to go out and find old school serial cable upload the channels about five times before the scanner remembered them and then half the time have to turn the trunking off and on so I can hear the local police and fire.
5,"Love, Love Love!!!!!","This is the easiest & most fun to bring your avatar powers to the surface. Mr Gray did an awesome job with this writing. There's alot to learn about avatar powers but Mr Gray will take you from A to Z & if you faithfully practice, your powers will surprise you. There are just some books that I have that I refuse to ever resale & this is one of them."
4,Nice game but....,"Enemy Engaged is a nice game. The graphics look great and the gameplay is detailed and realistic. Almost too realistic actually. If you are looking for a sim that has a lot of high octane action that has you scrambling to take out multiple enemies all at once, look elsewhere. Action is not the focus of EE. Realism is the name of the game.Overall a good game. Tech. support could be better though."
1,bummer,"i also could not get the game to run.installed fine on a very upgraded HP running xp but couldnt get any keyboard or joystick controls to respond,even though the game recognised my joystick.I also could not get the cd game manual to run.dl'ing updates proved useless as well.too bad as the game appears awesome to those it decides to play for :\"
1,Poor game,It is very boring and limited help or instruction. It should be notice for the consummers. I was my choice
1,what is going on?,"I bought this game in anticipation of a better sequel to Razorworks Apache/Havoc, but I could not get the game to work right,and I tried it on 3 seperate systems! The game loaded O.K., but when I tried to use a joystick the views were locked in a certain position. It was impossible to fly! I even downloaded the demo version and the same thing happened! I tried to get support from Take2 Interactive with no luck. So I just gave up! Bummer!"
5,A LOVELY READ,"THIS BOOK INTEGRATES ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY WITH CURRENT DIETARY CONCERNS AND PROVIDES NEW IDEAS FOR HOW WE APPROACH OUR DAILY FOOD INTAKE. IT IS SUPPORTIVE, SOOTHING AND AN EASY READ WITH LOVELY VISUAL ALLUSIONS CONTAINED IN THE COMMENTARIES.IT IS, AS I SAID IN THE TITLE, A LOVELY READ, EVEN IF ONE WERE NOT SEARCHING FOR ""THE DIET""."
4,Does everything it says,Only thing I would wish is that there was one to stick on screens! My cat is baffled by these when I put them on the couch and knows to avoid them. They never leave behind residue. Now to keep her off the window screens!
4,Works as advertised,"Unless your little beasties like sticky stuff, this will keep your felines from scratching whatever you use them on. Easy to use and plenty of strips in the package."
2,Terrible for countertops,"This is a terrible product for countertops. Did not deter my cat one bit from climbing all over the counters - I saw her walking around on them like it's nothing. Worst part is that after the thing failed to do any good I spent the better part of an afternoon scraping sticky residue from all my countertops - these strips do NOT come off clean, at least from the average grade kitchen counter surface. Tried a number of kitchen cleaners and they're still sticky. Can't say how well this works / how easy to remove on other surfaces, but for countertops, it was no good for my cat. If you still want to give it a try (cats are pretty different when it comes to this kind of thing) I would suggest covering the counters with tin foil first and putting the strips on the tin foil. That's what I wish I would've done (other than not shelling out ** bucks for this in the first place)."
2,Works poorly on microfiber,"I am a huge fan of Sticky Paws. Up until now, I have been using it quite sucessfully on a chenille twill woven couch. Then I bought the microfiber loveseat...Sticky Paws doesn't stick! It just drops off. Too bad, it's been a great product. I hope the company can change the formulation, because my results have been terrific with loosely woven fabric."
2,Doesn't really work...,"It doesn't really work for us. After we applied it at the edge of the sofa, at first, our cats were afraid. Then, they started to play with it. The last scene we saw was they were using their teeth instead of paws to pull the thing off. Guess they think that's their new toy."
4,Sticky Paws Works but Application is Tricky,"I have purchased this item more than once and it works for my two kittens. However, when I'm appyling the item to my furniture, it sometimes attaches itself to my fingers and then the sticky strip is ruined. I'd say this happens about 1 out of four applications. My kittens stay away. It sticks well to both fabrics and woods and doesn't discolor or cause any other weird residues. It's clear, so it's not noticeable once applied. It's a pretty good product, and if I could apply this 100% of the time without the attachment to my fingers and wrinkling up, I would have given it a 5/5."
3,Worked at first,Worked at first but then my cat made it a game to slowly roll the strip down into a ball then it became a toy.
3,Sticky Paws,One of my cats doesn't seem repelled by this product. He continues to claw at my box spring. It may me just him and not this product.
4,It does it's job pretty well,"The packaging comes with plenty of tape for the money, and when applied to a surface my cat is definitely detered from scratching. The tape doesn't stick so well to our couch and my cat has successfully removed some chunks (the jerk!) but overall I am happy with the money I spent. My couch will remain intact for much longer thanks to Sticky Paws!"
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"First of all, the strips are so small as to be useless for large furniture. Second, I wish I had just used packing tape. I just peeled off the strips, and my sofa now has GLUE stuck to it. I am so angry, as this is a brand new sectional sofa and I now have no idea how I'm going to safely remove the residue.DON'T BUY THIS LOUSY PRODUCT."
1,Terrible,"I never write reviews, but this product made me so mad that I decided to write one. I got these to keep my cats off of my countertops and kitchen table. Within minutes of applying the sticky paws, my cat was on the table walking over the sticky tape without hesitation. Now I am trying to remove the tape, but it has left a sticky residue everywhere that won't come off. I've tried rubbing alcohol and dish soap and the sticky residue is still there. I love how it specifically states in the description that it is easily removed and leaves no residue behind. This product was also very expensive and I could barely cover my countertops before running out of the strips. Save your money...if you want to try something like this, try double-sided tape instead. I had no trouble removing that."
4,A Special Moment,"I just finished looking at the video, ""This is for you Lord "". I enjoyed the video very much because it showed me how God can conduct his Spirit in such a way to combine music and the Word of God spoken by Jackie McCullough to reach others. The combination gave a powerful message that Christians have hope when it seems we don't have anything else. The message was very inspirational. I have several of Jackie McCullough's videos and I would rate this one very high. The family of vocals was excellent. I would definitely recommend this one to others."
3,Disappointed,"To be honest maybe I was expecting too much as I have been very impressed with Freud in the past. The quality of the cut that is shearing the wood is magnificent. The mating of the cope to the stile is poor. I spent about 4 hours working with the shims to make the best fit I could. These cutters are adequate, but I am goingto consider other manufacturers in the future."
5,Outstanding Snack,"I have tried many flavors of the Kettle Valley Fruit Bars, and this is my favorite. These are packed with real fruit and are very satisfying. If you are looking for a tasty alternative to the typical overprocessed, full-of-preservatives fruit snack, give these a try!"
5,Good fruit roll-up alternative,"These come in lots of flavors, and while they're not EXACTLY like the ""roll-ups"", the kids seem to like them just fine. They're not too chewy and they have no added sugar, just fruit and juice concentrates. They're also not perfectly smooth and flat like roll-ups, because they have the fruit pulp in them.I definitely recommend them, just be aware--if you're expecting them to be just like the high-fructose-corn-syrup sweetened commercial junk, they're not. Try these on the kids without offering your own baggage and see what they think."
5,return of the voice,i personally believe this is the best thing david has done in along time.its good 2 see him back.
4,Lowfat versions of favorite italian dishes,"I like the recipes included in this book, especially since they are made lower in fat and calories and have the Weight Watcher points for each recipe. Of course some recipes just can not be recreated for a lower fat version that would meet the demanding tastes of a true Italian!"
4,exciting recipes!,This is a wonderful authentic italian cookbook! The best is that WW wrote it and I can enjoy healthy eating.
5,You have to try this!,"Just recently heard about this book and purchased it recently. So far I have made 5 recipes and each one came out absolutely delicious! I can't wait to continue checking out the different recipes that are so yummy! My husband and I are both Italian and love Italian cooking, but could do without the fat...so this book let's us have the best of both worlds!"
5,Fantastico!!!!,This is an amazing compilation of italian favorites - authentic tastes and flavors. I have enjoyed every thing I have made especially the focaccia bread with rosemary. Anyone on the WW Flex plan should include this in their cookbook library. Its awesome!
3,Why do libertarians like Piper's assassination fantasy?,"""Lone Star Planet"" postulates that in a rational society, to the extent that you can call Texas ""rational,"" private individuals can legally murder politicians who exert power in ways they don't like. How does this differ from kook hate literature like ""The Turner Diaries""? Would we feel somewhat differently about Piper now if Lee Harvey Oswald had a copy of ""Lone Star Planet"" in his possession during his arrest for shooting President Kennedy -- in Texas?"
4,Every Picture Tells a Story,"The adage goes: Every picture tells a story. Bronzino's ""Allegory with Venus and Cupid"" tells its story within the pages of Fisk's clever, witty look at sixteenth century Florence. The painting, the artists, the models, the ruling class, and the city itself come to life, displaying a wide and varied blend of attributes; some poingnent, some humorous, some disturbing and dark. You'll enjoy this imaginative glimpse into the events surrounding the birth of a painting."
3,Why doesn't he put some drums in there???,"Q: Was the original song title of Nicoleen really Nicotine??? Original sound play with a hint of whimsical, nice but a little candy-like."
2,flannel fiasco,"First, the set of sheets were supposed to be King and they sent Queen. They had none to replace them since it was a clearance sale. So I thought we would use them on a different bed. The fitted sheet does not stretch over the edge of the new mattress' with the pillow toppers. I think all mattress' are made this thick any more. Also the pillow cases are very small. I don't think people use pillows that small on a Queen size bed. I ended up giving them to a couple that just moved here from California, they don't know good flannel sheets from bad ones."
3,Too Big,"I purchased these flannel sheets for a crazy low price. After I washed the sheets and put them on my bed, I noticed how ridiculously oversized they were. I checked to make sure I ordered ""queen"", and I did. The sheets are very comfy and they hold up well in the wash. My only gripe is that they bunch up because they are so big. But, for the cost, I can't complain."
4,FLANNEL QUEEN SHEETS,A GREAT BUY AND SURE KEEPS ME WARM. TO HOT ON WARM NIGHTS BUT FANTASTIC ON COLD NIGHTS
5,a work of art,"This is my favorite Ikkyu translation and collection. John Stevens captures Ikkyu's wry wit and his earthy sensibilities, his concurrent plunges into deep despair, and his profound spirituality. The presentation of the book is delightful as well. This is a tiny book. You can carry it in your pocket. It has lovely artwork intermingled with the poetry. I read this in one sitting, and then over and over."
4,The Wild Ways of Crazy Cloud,"Ikkyu's poetry is extremely wide in scope, ranging from poems expressing his understanding and experiences of love and sex, to poems which express ""standard"" Mahayana/Zen doctrine, to poems which protest the way in which society treats the poor and vulnerable. Mr. Stevens does an admirable job of selecting poems for this volume which are representative of this range. He provides a brief but useful introduction, which gives enough information to understand the cultural setting of Ikkyu and his poetry, without intruding upon the reader's own appreciation and enjoyment of Ikkyu's work. ""Skeletons"", which Mr. Stevens renders accurately into a combined prose/poetry piece, is particulary interesting, as it is in this work that we see Ikkyu teach his form of Zen in a way that is both instructive in content and beautiful in form."
5,Very very good. Buy it and listen.,"I have to give this album five stars because of the inflated rating system on this site. It is indeed a terrific album of unusual yet somehow digestible music. Unless you prefer sentimental drivel such as Julio Iglesias or Celine Dion. Here we have Jazz/samba/hip hop/spoken word/unknown thing fusion. One of those discs you put on and leave on for a long time. As perfect as the original Getz/Byrd ""Jazz Samba""? Of course not. That would be a ten star album minus three for brevity. But as good a purchase as you are likely to make this year, unless of course you finally get around to picking up Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"". Man, you backward. And for everyone who forgot, buy Coltrane. Soultrane will knock you out, whoever you are."
5,jewlery stand,This is great. Its just the right size and holds anything you need. Its deffinitely worth the money and is great for hanging bangles on.
3,Satisfactory,"It works okay, but sometimes tough to get the bars on and off the hooks. It is beautiful for the price and looks great on my dresser."
5,ALL YOU EXPECT AND MORE!!![.],EXCELLENT! CAPTURES THE GREAT JUDY GARLANDS TALENT ON RADIO LIVE AND HER WONDERFUL PERSONALITY! A GREAT ADDITION TO ANY COLLECTOR OF JUDY GARLAND! A MUST HAVE! THESE PERFORMANCES ARE THE ULTIMATE! JUDY THE TRUE GIFTED PERFORMER! HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!***** 5 STARS!
1,uncomfortable,"These panties were not comfy at all. I agree that the front seam cut me in half and rubbed in the wrong place. I threw them in the garbage after one hour. The other Hanes boy briefs were much more comfy but I cannot find them anywhere. The looked like real boy briefs and were so easy to wear, no riding up or cutting int the wrong place. I would not buy anything with a center seam again."
2,run large,I expected these to be fitted but they're baggy--or they run large. I'll probably reserve mine for sleeping in. I'm not sure if I have the right size or not but I'd suggest buying a size down.
2,Not comfy for me.,"I usually love Hanes, but the seam up the front and back was uncomfortable. They tended to cut me up the middle."
5,Rick Ross Gotta A Lotta Dough,"When I first heard ""Hustlin"" on BET, I was amazed at the confidence Rick Ross possesses. His delivery, flow, tone, and general style are unmatched right now. Every Ross verse has lines that have deep meaning, and you feel his pain andhis truth through his lyrics. ""Port of Miami"" is Top 5 when it comes to Rap artist debut albums. It is right up there with Illmatic and Reasonable Doubt. Every song on the CD provides something worth listening too. Close your eyes and invision what Ross is portraying through witty punchlines, and extreme metaphors. Worth every single penny, Ross is the Boss.TOP 51. Cross That Line2. Push It3. For Da Low4. Where My Money5. Street Life/Im A GROSS"
2,What Went Wrong,"As expected Port Of Miami is packed with sick beats, mellow beats, and even more sick ones. It's probably an album you could play in a club without skipping any tracks. With all of the great production there is little room for Ross to mess up in the lyrical department but somehow he found a way to do so. There aren't any catchy hooks and definitely no thought provoking lyrics. Rick literally talks about the same exact things in every single song. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it does when Rick has to use the lyrics from his hooks just to end his verses. You can't feel any heart from Rick Ross in this album. There aren't any songs about his life at all; it's really just him bragging the entire album. There's not much to say about Port Of Miami except that it seems to be an album for cats from Miami, club heads, and beat heads because every beat on here is hot but like I said there are no good hooks or lyrics."
1,Port of Miami should be deported.,"Despite incredible beats, this godawful album with rick ross with that horrible suge knight imitation is so bad it's a crime to even send this fool to jail, ross delivers a horrible performance in this debut, only the songs deliver more than the rapper itself.Now Miami is known for rappers & dj's like 2 Live crew, Trick Daddy & DJ Khaled, here they misfire here with this clunkerPort of Miami is a port to nowhere.I Hated this albumBig thumbs down.Music Rating *1/2 Stars."
3,It's AIGHT!!!,"It's a cool lil album right up to track 10, then it loses me. Now, I'm not about to break down why it didn't stick with me after track 9, because I really don't know myself. Hustlin and Push It sold a dream, sorry to say, the album as a whole couldn't fulfill.......Peace"
3,Alright Debut,I had a lot of hype for this album and could not wait till it hit stores and the day it came out I purchased it at Best Buy. Anyways I went home and started listening to it and I thought it was okay. I thought he would have better lyrics but the production saves this album from being a disappointment. The singles are great and some of the other songs are good or okay and the rest is just filler. I only recommend this to fans of down south rap or fans of Rick Ross because this album is below par.
4,Tight,Tha Cd is Good overall. Nice R&B tracks. Not what expecting from Rick Ross. But good overall. Its an good CD to listen all the way through.
2,Decent Debut,"This is a decent debut from Rick Ross w/ some great guest apperences like Akon, Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, and others. But the consistent talking about drugs and illegaly moving 'em gets tiring, the beats are decent but at some points real weak. Decent debut more with borrowing then buying."
4,COCAINE RAPPER RICKY ROSS,"Rick Ross is the New Cocaine RapperFav. Track are White House, Push it, Where My money and Prayer...Best album i heard in the 3rd quarter made every dude in the hood want to get in that DRug gameAlbum is Fire stop hating!!!!"
2,Yuck!!!,"The two stars are only on the strength of ""Hustlin"". I've had this album for a week and I can't bear to listen through to its no doubt dreadful end. I am vastly disappointed and reminded of why I usually download mixtapes these days. To be truthful, if I had known that he had anything to do with Slip-n-Slide, then I would have passed. They don't make good albums. Word to Rick, stick real close to Cool & Dre and The Runners, then jump ship as fast as you can. You're to talented to be with SNS."
3,Ross- Not a Classic!!!,"Overall, the album is ok. The production is what stands out on the album. His Lyrics are basic and his lyrical content is tiring after awhile. Rappers who preach that their album is a classic, does not make an album a classic. Fans dictate what album is a classic or not. This album is ok, but will never be on the level of ""Reasonable Doubt, The Chronic, Illmatic, or even Common's BE"", The songs that stand out are the Hustlin Remix, cross the line, Push It, and Blow,You want a hip hop classic, wait for Papoose Album to drop!!! Than you will have a hip hop classic. YOu heard it hear first!!!Everything else, the songs did not move me at all."
3,Rick Ross Debut Could Of Been Better,"I Like Rick Ross But I Was Expecting This Album To Be Great But The Lyrics Was Good Only Thing I Didnt Like Was He Had Alot Of R&B; Singers on it i Was Really disapointed with thatMy Favorite Track Was1.""Where My Money"" #9 on cd2. ""White House"" #12 on cd3. Push It #2 on cd"
3,Listen to what others say!!!,"I read the reviews before I bought this product, and I should have listened to the flavor warning. This really does not have a grape taste to it. I was very disappointed with the flavor. It tastes and smells not so good. My son seems to like them though, so...That being said, I do like the other Kettle Valley products, including flavor and texture. My household favorite is the Orchard Blend. I also recently purchased the ""Fruit and Fiber Apricot Bar,"" which has a great flavor to it.Overall, if you are looking for a grapey grape fruit bar, this is NOT the one. I will not be eating these, but my husband and son will do so willingly."
1,Franz Lehar Overtures & Waltzes,DON'T BUY IT! I like Lehar's music very much but this recording is awful. Hi end equipment screams for you to eject it. Frankly I'm surprised that Amazon allows such poor quality to be sold on it's site. I use Amazon quite a bit and intend to continue using it but this purchase has shaken my confidence in it. Makes me want to hear future selections before buying on line. If I can I will return it.
5,The Best!,"I compared my EM-500 to a Palm and there was no comparison. Next I compared it to the Jornada and the Ipaq. With the Jornada, there was again no comparison. The Ipaq beat it out in one area only - speed - but barely. In a side by side test the Ipaq only opened programs a fraction of a second faster with the single exception of MS Reader where the Ipaq was much faster. Size? The Ipaq and EM-500 are comparible. Screen? The EM 500 wins hands down. I compared them side by side at Best Buy and everyone around me chose the EM 500. THe Ipaq just looked a little washed out. Memory? The EM 500 at Christmas was [$] with a free 28 meg card. That gives it 44 megs of total memory compared to Ipaq's 32 megs at [$100 more]. If I have to choose between the Ipaq or EM 500 at the same price, The EM 500 wins especially with its free memory card. In this case, the EM 500 is actually cheaper!"
1,Poor craftsmanship!,"Sure the em-500 is great, while it works! I bought two units off ebay and they were like new when I received them. One worked fine for only about six months, then the internal memory died and left me with a 200 dollar paperweight. The second lasted another six months. Then it too, developed a case of the internal flu. It won't even work right long enough for me too get the information stored in it off! If it were just one unit I might think I were just unlucky, but two going bad tells me these aren't built to withstand even normal use! A paper and pencil would have been so much cheaper!"
1,In a word...don't,"I bought this at a club warehouse-type store. I thought it was a good deal since it was packaged with a 32mb multi media card at an incredible price. I knew it did not have all the bells and whistles of a good HP or Compaq, but for my needs it seemed like it would work out fine. Wrong. I could never get it to communicate with my computer. My computer is no lightweight; I am running Windows 2000 Professional with a 1.5 gig Pentium 4. I called the Casio support line, and after 25 minutes of following their suggestions it still didn't work. I took it back for a refund. I will now forget I have ever heard of Casio pocket PCs, and suggest you do the same."
4,Cassiopeia-EM 500,"This is a great product I use it for my bussiness. Once you learn how to use it, it is as easy as a home pc. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because you cannot delete any programs that came pre-loaded for example all the internet programs that came with it. Also I can't seem to find a auto adaptor or a cable to connect to my pc anywhere. If you purchace this product make sure you buy the screen covers with it or you will scratch your screen.Sincerely: Aaron"
1,"Lasted only 18 months, then died completely","The title says it all - I now have an extremely expensive paper weight after less than 18 months of use. I realize that no electronics equiptment seems to last long anymore, but this is ridiculous! Stay away from Casio!"
3,Very good...except when replacing armband.,"Well, i'm not gonna waste a lot of words. The watch itself is great. The numbers are large and the menus are easy to use.However, the biggest complaint is replacing the stupid armband. Mine got broken so I went to WalMart and got a replacement. I got home and tried to put it on. Spend 2 hours. Didn't get it on. SO i take it back to WalMart and have them put it on. It turns out that the stupid engineers didn't design the little groove niche right where you insert the two little metal rods to attach it to the watch. The watch's groove is bent in a curvy shape, however, the rods are straight. It took the WalMart guy quite a while to put it on and he had to use a bunch of special tools.If it weren't for that, I would give it 5 stars."
2,Good watch...bad wrist band,"As some other reviewers have noted, this is a good watch until it is time to replace the wristband. The people at Wal Mart gave up on installing the band after 30 minutes. The people at Target were able to install it after about 30 minutes of effort. I could not install the band and don't think I would buy the product again."
3,Decent sports watch for the money.,"The watch is decent. No real problems with it as of yet. However I do not like the functionality of the Chronometer/splitter. The button at times is overly sensitive and on a few occasions it has reset during my workout. Also, as a lap counter it fails miserably."
3,Good watch so far,"So far I haven't had any problems with this watch. I have worn it for a week and no sign of the band breaking yet, but after reading all the bad reviews, I have been sort of extra careful not to put too much stress on it. Besides the possibility of the band breaking, the features on this watch are good, so for the price this has been a good watch so far. I give it a solid three stars becaus it is, after all, just a $25 dollar watch."
4,african cowboy music,"this music is great stuff from the western african nation of guinea and it demonstrates a form of music that has been popular there for many years. these stripped down nuts and bolts versions of classic tunes is by far the best way to hear this original style of music. It has elements of country music as well as, folk music. Check out Krumromo Aye Dinn, Waytime Aam and Onipa Nyke. All three are great songs that are soulful and light. I have played on my radio show to demonstrate this style.The Sleeper, host of african vibe"
3,"""Blind Spot"" a good character study","A gripping tale of relationships, greed and obsession, Adam Barrow's ""Blind Spot"" is a strong character study in the life of a suburban college professor and his family, and a less-affluent group of factory workers. Both sides fall prey to an adoption scam gone haywire.While the book has a strong subplot and character development (I really felt sorry for ""Lester""), it was difficult to view any of the factory workers as anything other than a group of rednecks with below-average intelligence. I wanted to view the couple that adopted the little boy as protagonists, but they simply didn't have any endearing characteristics. The character of Marshall was strong, but his wife seemed distant and unsupportive -...but hey, to each his own. Barrow is an excellent writer. At times during the book I was amazed by his capacity for descriptive settings...I felt as if I was actually IN Chicago on a hot August day searching hopelessly for my little boy..."
5,Meditate and pray,"This book adds a meditative quality in one's daily communication with God. It does not detract from personal meditation and prayer, but provides a discipline so often needed in the tumult of our daily lives"
5,"A wonderful prayer book! (high quality materials, too)",I was looking for a good prayer book that my wife and I could use to integrate the Liturgy of the Hours into our lives. This prayer book has proved to be perfect for us. The book itself is made of high quality materials throughout including the binding and the paper on which the pages are printed. One of the features we really like is the calendar of saints in the back. The calendar identifies at least one saint for each day of the year. The daily roster of saints emphasizes for us our connection and fellowship with the long line of believers who have preceded us in the faith down through the centuries.
5,"Nice and usable, elegant and simple.","This is a shorter version of Morning (Lauds) and Evening (Vespers) Prayer, using only one psalm per hour. The one week repeating cycle also includes Mid-morning (Terce), Mid-day (Sext), and Mid-afternoon (None) prayer, as well as Night (Compline) Prayer. After the Hours, there is a section of prayers and blessings. It is hardbound with sewn binding. This is a nice, handy, short, elegant, simple aid to regular prayer."
4,Relaxing,This is a great CD to sit back and listen to and let your mind turn to God. Played softly it is very relaxing.
5,great boot!!!,"This is a great boot!! So hard to find where I live, glad I found it on Amazon!! amazon is the best place to shop!"
5,Shine The Light,"Another reviewer pointed out this is one of Ronstadt's most underrated recordings, and I will have to agree with that statement. WINTER LIGHT is an excellent collection of music. The CD features an array of cover songs, that Linda handles extremely well! Her cover of Emmylou Harris' ""A River For Him"" is simply beautiful and she adds her own layers to this classic song. Her cover of the Beach Boys ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"" captures the song's original emotion. Other covers include a cover of Deborah Chessler's ""It's Too Soon To Know"" and Bacharach/David's ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"". She sparkles on ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"", and shows great restraint on the title track. Vocally she is in top form on this album, and its worth looking into in my opinion. ""Heartbreats Accelerating"" is another highlight on this album. Give WINTER LIGHT a fair listen, you might be surprised."
5,One of the Best CD's I've ever heard,"I really think the is one of the best CD's out there. This cd has mostly romantic songs, my favorites, ""Oh, NO Not my Sweet Baby"", and songs 1,2, and 3. I have listened to it over and over, and I still LOVE it. My suggestion, BUY IT! And don't take my word for it, listen to the samples. Great job, Linda"
5,"If you believe in the Multiverse, Next makes perfect sense","All the possible futures seen by Chris were various alternate realities branching off from past decisions. When he saw those futures, he disrupted the quantum state of the multiverse and a different outcome manifested into reality due to quantum wave collapse. As Chris said; ""If you see the future, you change it.""As for the ending, it was more brilliant that people think. The terrorists knew Chris Johnson was a magician so they used the same trick used by all magicians; diversion. Chris' girlfriend was the hand seen by the audience while the other hand detonated the nuclear bomb in L.A. That's why Chris said ""I made a mistake."" just before the bomb went off."
3,Good Movie Marred by the 9/11 Scare Tactics,"Next, a movie based on the Philip K. Dick short story, is very clever in spots. Nicholas Cage plays a precognative gmbler/magician who can see two minutes into the future. The interesting thing in this movie is that he can see all possible futures; this led to some interesting scenes in the movie. The plot revolves around terrorists planning to blow up LA who finad out that this guy could upset their master plan. Government agents are looking for this guy too for the same reason. Ahh, terrorism, the all purpose plot device - why blow up LA? Just because I guess - whatever..Anyway, the special effects are cool, there are some good action sequences and Cage is a good choice to play the main character in the movie. Its not worth the 9-10 bucks it would have taken to see this in the theatres but it is worth renting/buying on sale."
3,I like Cage but...,"It was an OK flick. Cage was not impressive in this one. Jessica Biel was more believable than him, which is kinda pathetic. I am a sucker for action movies, and the action was fairly enjoyable."
4,One of the best movies released in 2007 in terms of suspense and suprises!,"This is the best movie released in 2007 in terms of suspense and suprises.This movie kept me on edge from the beginning till the end. I kept asking myself ""What's happening next?"". I could not guess it. It might also because I have never read the story that this picture was based on. That turned out to be a good thing. I enjoyed it.The ending is the biggest surprise. I've never seen any thing like that. The most illogical thing about this script is Nicolas was able to see things only 2 minutes before they happenned. Some people said that's not enough time to act on them in reality. But I can ignore that.I wish the film had explored the relationship between Nicolas and Jessica more. That way, it would have became a suspense and love story.Anyway, it's still one of the best films I've seen so far this year."
4,Next Sequel Please!,"First off, let me start be saying that I never found Jessica Biel to be attractive during her Seventh Heaven years. Boy, was I wrong! What was I thinking? She's quite striking!Anyhow, on to the flick. Concerning what another reviewer said about Nicolas Cage's recent failures--alluding to Lord Of War, Weatherman, and this movie.WRONG! Weatherman was a bit on the boring side...true, Lord Of War could have been worlds better...granted, but Next does not belong in that list. This movie is entertaining and enlightening from the start. The reason for four stars instead of five though is this:SPOILER AHEAD!There was absolutely no reason to go through 50% of the film in a vision of the future only to have Jessica Biel's character taken out of the equation altogether. With that occurrence, the only recovery would be a sequel. So bring on the next Next!This movie is a must-see!"
2,ponderous platitudinal puffery,"Cage is unable to find footing in this loosely defined ambiguous character which ultimately comes across as a little creepy and perfectly goofy. Yet another poorly executed action film with a matrix-ish subtext concerning the nature of reality and so forth.The writers and director could care less about any intellectual or philosophical discourse and use ""belief systems"" superficially only because it's the thing to do these days and such ponderous platitudes are required for the story. The film boils down to hot chicks and guys shooting at each other.The ending is meant to stimulate thought........instead, it is yet another irritating point tagged on to a series of ill conceived notions of plot."
3,Movie: 3/5 Picture Quality: 3.75~4.75/5 Sound Quality: 4~4.5/5 Extras: 2.5/5,"Version: U.S.A (Paramount) / Region A, B, CMPEG-4 AVC BD-50Running time: 1:36:10Movie size: 30,727,809,024 bytesDisc size: 39,483,346,411 bytesTotal bit rate: 42.60 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 31.93 MbpsLPCM 5.1 48 khz/24-bit/6.9 Mbps EnglishDD AC3 5.1 640Kbps English / Spanish / FrenchSpecial Features - All presented in HD.#Making the Best Next Thing (18:14)#The Next ""Grand Idea""(6:51)#Visualizing the Next Move (7:46)#Two Minutes in the Future with Jessica Biel (2:27)#Theatrical trailerThe U.S / U.K versions suffers from Jaggies aka Aliasing. Looks like a filtering bug from Digital Intermediate (DI) to 1080p master."
3,About what I expected,"The premise was really engaging. I like all the actors. So why isn't this better? Well, I guess I'm getting a little tired of the Cage laconic hero. It was wearing thin in Ghost Rider, and gets a little grating. It is all the more frustrating because I have seen him do so much better. Do I have to even mention Leaving Las Vegas ? I can't figure out why Julianne Moore fancies herself a ""tough guy"" action hero. It didn't really work in ""Hannibal"", and it still comes across strident and trying too hard. She does other things much much better.As a sum, the movie has lots of people doing things that they either don't do well or shouldn't even be trying to do. This eventually overwhelms the rest of an OK movie."
3,Next please...,"I was hoping for more from Next. The premise was so interesting. The story seemed like a winner to me. But in Next they just didn't do very much with it.A man that can see two minutes into the future gave me visions of an action movie version ofMemento. Instead we wind up with Nicholas Cage as aNeo-clone. I wouldn't think seeing two minutes into the future would give anybody superhuman reflexes enough to dodge bullets fired point blank from a machine gun.Really this is a two star movie that was bumped up a star by an extremely well done shoot-out near the end. Also, Julianne Moore shows us that really she's too good to be doing this stuff. Still, since she's here she does her part gamely"
3,Not too bad,"This is another movie made from a PK Dick short story. While thoroughly enjoyable, it suffers from one flaw that I cannot write about without spoinling the ending. Dick has a wonderful way of creating scientific abilities without explaining how they work. In this case, the Nicholas Cage character can see 4 minutes into the future and change the outcome of events by taking action in the present. It's a pretty clever twist on time travel stories. He finds a woman (Jessica Biel) who ""amplifies"" his power so that when he is in her presence he can see much further ahead. Again, no explanation - it's just accepted as part of the story. I recommend this movie if you are a time travel / science fiction buff. Otherwise, the story is a little flat and the relationships are superficial. Although I did enjoy Julianne Moore in a tough-guy role that we don't usually see her in."
4,Cut and Run,"I loved the movie. It scratched all my Sci-Fi itches. Sure, there were a few plot holes here and there. But overall great acting by Cage, Biel and Moore. It was also a treat to see Peter Falk. I loved the scene in the diner where he tests his options for approaching her.As much as I loved it, the movie failed at the end. I was expecting to see an alternate scenario, but it just left me hanging, and not in a sequel sort of way. But in a ""the movie wasn't finished"" sort of way. If that's the way the book ended, I suppose I can forgive the director for choosing to end the movie that way. But then I would say that Mr. Dick left me hanging. Overall great, but the ending was a real let down."
4,"Good, not great...","I liked this movie, but I did not love it. I had really high hopes for this movie, because of the great cast. Unfortunately, I felt a little let down...I did not feel that Nicholas Cage was up to the standards that he set in movies such as Face Off, Con Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds. I felt his performance is this movie was bland in comparison....That is just my opinion. The movie was otherwise a great flick, hence the four and not a three."
4,Next to Godliness,"What would you do if you could see into your immediate future?This is a concept movie that actually works very well on a number of levels. Admittedly, the ending can be feel like a cop out to many viewers, but it actually is very much in keeping with the general theme of the movie. Accept it for what it is and it's really not that bad an ending.Cage is, as always, very laid back in his portrayal, but that works very well for him. His magician persona works best when he gives no tell of what he is planning or what he has seen in the future.To put this in proper context, this movie is inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick, who wrote the stories that spawned ""Total Recall"", ""Blade Runner"", ""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Paycheck"" and ""Minority Report""."
2,Good movie...but,"This movie died at the end. When you see that Nicholas Cage had seen the last 30 minutes of the movie in a vision, the movie died quickly."
2,ending ruined it,"Good actors. Creative idea. So, why is it terrible?Well, the ending is the worst bit. Just when I was gettting into the movie, they try and through a twist in there but it just becaomes a really lame excuse not to finish the story.The theme ideas of fate and destiny are there, but never really developed to make for good discussion."
2,HD DVD does work in DVD Player,I didn't realize that this HD DVD wouldn't work in my regular DVD player or my Blu-Ray player.It's worthless to me.
4,Next,Was very good movie. The ending was a huge but better surprise. A lot of suspense and action. Love the two of these acting together.
4,Above Ave Sci Fi with some great stunts,I especially enjoyed the stunt at the motel where Cage used his girlfriend to cause an ever snowballing amount of mayhem as they both tried to get away. This stunt shows off both what his look ahead abilities can do and their limits because he does not see his girlfriend being captured by the bad guys (or does he? wait for the twist at the end of the movie). This stunt is enough to make a combined 10 James Bond films blush with envy. WOW!Too bad the film ends up being a shoot um up at the end.
4,Dejavu,"This type story has been visited many times, but this is a nice variation on the theme. I didn't feel I was watching a remake of anything. Cage plays a magician with a Vegas act that gets noticed by a government agent played by Moore. She wants him to find a bomb terrorists have planted. Now it sounds predictable and it is to some degree. However; I was never bored or felt the story was out of line. Overall a reasonably entertaining SciFi movie. I recommend renting before buying. I think it is replayable."
4,a not that bad movie,"this BD movie story is simple. the only reason i purchase ($13) is that i like Jessica Biel. 4.5* for video, 3.5* for story, 3.5* for acting,4* for audio."
1,Garbage....,"What happens when you cast a wooden actor like Nick Cage, an airhead like Biel, and come up with some sort of time travel story that looks like the 13th rip-off of Back To The Future, well you have this piece of celliod trash.Juliane Moore deserves better scripts sent her way then this trash."
3,"Good enough first draft, now please start making the real movie","No movie based on a P.K.Dick story can be entirely without interest. The concept of looking two minutes into the future is a good basis for an interesting plot. This movie has quite a few good scenes exploring it. Best is of course the diner scene when Cage gets to know Biel.The weakness of the movie is the lack of plot for the terror scenario. It is not enough to take a bunch of different young Europeans and some Asians and let them handle something which is said to be a nuclear device. Actually this part is like a simple copy of 'Die Hard IV', but without bothering to explain the who and why.So let us send the producers of this movie back to the drawing board. With a good script writer, something could be made out of this story."
2,An appropriate title.....,"Another movie with an intriguing premise that freefalls into typical hollywood schlock. I've lost track of how many movies start out with a really cool idea, then fizzle once the plot unfolds. The 1st 20 minutes or so of this movie are fun and entertaining. Then , when you discover the 'Typical-Outlandish-Hollywoodized-Plot' TM (lol), you can't wait for the ending. Nickolas Cage is a favorite actor of mine, but his movies have been the pits lately, for the most part. I recommend watching this movie right up to the point where Cage's character gets busted in the casino. That whole idea of him outfoxing casino security was great together with the fascinating ability that he has.....and then.....the inevitable laughable, forced, typical, ridiculous, homogenized, hollyood plot kicks in, and your left wondering why great actors like Cage and Julianne Moore signed on to stuff like this. At least we get to see the gorgeous Jessica Biel!"
3,Somewhat better than average,"After Gone in 60 seconds, in this movie the character played by Nicolas Cage (Cris Johnson) has supernatural ability to see into the future for 120 seconds. It turns out, that besides approaching and attracting a girl in a restaurant, this time limit is also sufficient to agree to cooperate with the FBI and to plan the whole-scale anti-terrorist operation. Here comes my perplexity. To catch a sight of those forthcoming events Johnson is simply staring at the ceiling, whereas to specifically locate the bomb, he is being forced by a government agent to watch breaking news. The girl is being taken hostage, but terrorists, even knowing about Johnson's phenomenal ability, better take their chances shooting at him, rather than at the hostage. At the end, though, it remains uncertain, whether the FBI agents, the girl and the viewer is persuaded that the power to see the future can prevent somebody from pulling the trigger."
3,OK Then...it was OK,"I hardly remember this movie coming out in the theaters, that is not usually a good sign. But we watched it anyway, and I have to say it was just ok. It started off just fine, with our hero explaining his powers and his issues. But it has a really dumb ending. That episode of dallas comes to mind when Sue Ellen dreamed the whole season while her season long dead husband was showering. I am probably the only one who remembers that. Anyway, it was ok."
3,More potential than value...,"This was an excellent idea for a movie that simply fell short. The concept is incredible and it lends itself to endless jokes, gimmicks, and plot twists that simply weren't there. In the end, this movie came out only so-so. Nicolas Cage was fine (though his hair is getting stranger as he gets older), Julianne Moore was ok but her character was not terribly well developed, and Jessica Biel was cute, again her character was not so interesting. The plot could have been bigger and more believable, the effects were fine and probably the best part of the movie, and the acting was sub par. I would recommend you ignore this title much like the box office did, unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
5,Great movie,"I don't find a lot of movies that I want to actually buy but this one, I bought two of and gave one as a gift. It is interesting, funny, a little romantic, and a little edgy as Nicholas Cage sometimes is. I will watch this ones many times."
2,Way too much time on the relationship,guys will love the last half of the movie but the first 45 mins are made for the women. I have to say i loved the last 30 or so mins but the movie as a whole was maybe worth a 2 1/2.
3,"enjoyable, but Dick's prose is better.","I always tell people to read Philip K. Dick, because his prose is better than film adaptations.Jessica Biel is lovely as the romantic interest, and Nicolas Cage does a credible job (but not as good as he did in Lord of War).The plot follows the misadventures of Cage as a sideshow magician that can actually see into the future for two minutes, which the governemtn finds very interesting and wants to enlist him to thwart nuclear terrorists (like 24, but in a movie).Long chase scenes, special effects. power posturing, and defeated reluctant hero ensue, climaxing in.......If you think broken hearts and a nuclear explosion, you haven't seen a Hollywood film in years.Julianne Moore reprises her role as Special Agent Clarice Starling in this okay ""thriller."""
5,Next,"As a collector of many movies, one of my favorite actors is; Nicolas Cage, and with that said this movie is a must for a 'Cage' follower. Each time I watch it, is just as good as the first time"
1,"unsatisfying, not worth the watch - WARNING SPOILER","yeah, there were a couple of gimmicky scenes that kindof worked (casino evasion, diner) that others have detailed.the end product, though, was a mish-mash of all kinds of unrealized potential followed by a completely non-sensical ending.THINK ABOUT THIS: frank was only able to see into the future of the terrorist plot because the terrorists involved Jessica Biel's character in their plans as a hostage (what was her character's name again? who cares?).the whole rewind plot-twist at the end has Cage taking Jessica Biel out of the equation in the ""re-do"" scenario, which would short-circuit his ability to see into the terror plot's future.i guess L.A. is gonna be bummed...VERY UNSATISFYING."
2,I have seen the future ...and you'll be wasting your time...,"Kudos on the premise but any discerning movie watcher will be hacked off to no end by the direction the movie goes. It's not clever- it's an unabashed waste of your time. You can just hear the film makers patting themselves on the back after the ""twist"". Blecch.Instead of watching this cop-out of a film, use the ninety odd minutes to vacuum your stairs or clean the garage."
2,The future is here and its time is past.....,"Cage's last few movies; Lords of War, Weatherman and now Next, all fall short of what we have come to expect. Next starts of interestingly enough, gets exciting with the pursuit through the casino, then enthralling with the run down the mountainside and entrancing with the action scenes at the warehouse, tobe totally dashed to pieces with the last five minutes of what could have been a perfectly fantastic flick. Totally anticlimactic folks! It leaves you wondering, ""How could I have wasted my time and money on this?"""
2,Too much Compression,"I really enjoyed the movie. My complaint is the poor video quality for the mobile device. I would have liked the option to play the PC version on my mobile device, an Archos 504 160GB. When compressing videos to small file sizes, Divx should be used instead of WMV. For the price payed for the down load, I would rather buy the DVD and make my own video file, as I have done many times before, to insure good quality....JimNext"
5,Loved it!,I love time manipulation movies. This Cage movie is not oscar worthy but well worth the ticket price!
3,Good ideas bad execution,"While the plot and cast promise a lot, the movie fails to deliver on all levels. The necessary character development is lacking and sometimes the dialog is somewhat stilted. Cage and Biel occasionally rise above their direction and have the odd entertaining moment in their interplay; such as the cafe scenes. However Moore comes across cold and uninteresting and no attempt is made to draw the viewer into her character.A great pity that my fellow countryman, Tamahori, couldn't deliver more on such a great idea and cast. Maybe they spent all the budget on the cast and had none left to actually film the movie, develop the plot and let the actors do their thing, as the sum of the parts is much more than the whole on this occasion."
3,Great Special Effects!,"I liked most of this movie, especially the special effects, but the ending is too abrupt and the story is never resolved. I like movies where the author tells you the ending. It bothers me when I have to figure it out.Cage is ok in his role but not quite as good as he was in National Treasure. His relationship with Jennifer Beals character seemed forced and not real.Julianne Moore is excellent as a Secret Service agent tying to enlist Cage's ability to see into the future so that she can prevent an atomic bomb from destroying Los Angeles.It could have been a lot better."
3,"Not bad, not great either","After seeing the trailer I had expected the movie to be good. I wasn't too far off the mark. It was a good movie, but not a great one. I think it had the potential to be a very good movie, but unfortunately the whole terrorist plot just didn't seem the best way to show off the talent that Cage had in the movie. And the ending, although surprising, just left me feeling a little cheated. The CGI looked bad... so bad that you actually tell what's real and what's CGI during action sequences. I had expected that to be better in a movie like this..."
3,Light science fiction movie,"Only a few comments:The music was quite good. I'd give the movie 3 1/2 stars. I think the scriptwriters struggled a bit. Nice idea... but I think they struggled to make it really interesting. Actors performed reasonably well. I think Nicolas Cage should play more serious roles. I loved him in Face Off, Con Air and The Rock. But one gets the idea he is too serious an actor for these light action movies. Loved to see Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore together on the big screen."
2,Another bad movie from Nic Cage?? Jeez....,"Yet another bad movie from Nicholas Cage. And Julianne Moore sucked too. Only redeeming part of the movie was Jessica Biel, who is a babe and did a pretty good job playing the requisite damsel-in-distress."
1,"Cheap End of Movie Trick - Makes ""Bobby's Shower Scene in Dallas"" Look Good","Really enjoyed the different ""takes"" that Nicholas Cage does in the movie in seeing 2 minutes into future, but when Nicholas Cage utters the words ""I made a mistake"" at the end and the movie switches all the way back to an earlier scene and then Julianne Moore says ""Are You Ready?"" and Cage responds ""Yeah"" movie ends flatter than a pancake with a whole bunch of questions and no answers. It leaves you hanging in a ""What the heck?"" sort of way!!! REALLY BAD. A CHEAP TRICK AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH RENTING OR BUYING!!!"
3,Next,"Marketed as a sci-fi-action movie, ""Next"" was a huge box office failure. And it's a somewhat strange mix of genres. It starts out as more of a drama about a psychic, Cris (Nicolas Cage), working in Las Vegas, who meets Liz (Jessica Biel), a woman he's previously seen in visions. We're also introduced to Agent Ferris (Julianne Moore) and her team, who are looking for a missing bomb and asks Cris for help. He reluctantly helps them when he realizes Liz may be in danger.Then the viewer is rather abruptly thrown into fast, but quite uninspired action scenes with lots of shooting. Sometimes, Cris's special gift of seeing into the future seems a bit too convenient a way for him to get out of trouble. Before long, the movie is over, and the ending is something of a letdown.""Next"" felt like a pretty short movie, and it was not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, although I wouldn't recommend it for those looking for a non-stop action movie. It's entertaining, but not without flaws."
2,NEXT movie please - and quick,Great idea and concept but what an appalling movie. Lost all credibility (not that it had much in the first place) when Nicolas cage clones / replicates himself......... the ending just belies belief and you think why on earth you have sat through the last hour of utter drivel only for it to come to such an abrupt and implausible close. Clearly the producers lost interest and whoever edited it must have been on LSD. I suppose if you are brain dead and have nothing else to do on a cold / wet Spring day in NJ it might be something to put on as it works better than Ambien at inducing a deep coma.
1,How disappointed can one be?,"It is difficult to express the disappointment one can feel when one witnesses the descent of major musical star. This compilation of music from movies is, simply put, sad. Sorry, Neil, but this one just doesn't cut it."
1,Contract Filler Edited,"In baseball, when they give a player a big contract, they tend to play him, rather than a no name player who may be a lot better. This goes for Neil Diamond's career at Columbia. Big contract but mostly bad material. This could be the worst of all...passionless, over-emotive movie music. Diamond or Bolton?"
1,Call it the worst of any movie album,"I absolutely despised the complete version of this barely 70-minute long piece of trash. Neil Diamond has a disgusting voice. Regardless of what some people might think, this guy gotta go once and for all."
4,Woke Up Smiling,"I have been searching for a copy of this CD for years. I had borrowed it from a friend and recorded it onto cassette. Tape decks are now obsolete, and my friend no longer had the CD copy so I was excited to find one for such a great price."
5,One of the best ever,"I love this album!This is brilliant! I will NEVER willfully give up this CD. It was so well put together, the songs almsot seem to put together a story tailor made for Bedazzled.If you like ethereal, this album is a must."
4,Definitely worth buying!,"As one reviewer wrote this is an OK time-killer! I started leafing trough this to read about my favourite shows, but soon saw more. Living in Norway I'm not overly familiar with all aspects of American and British television (only the ""real hits"")And this was definitely a great way to learn little about unknown shows and facts in America and England televison.Next to Woody Allen's complete prose this the ""ideal bedside companion"""
2,"Okay, but no real substitute for watching them.","This ""Rough Guide"" is pretty rough; it's a pocket-sized trip through it from a British perspective, but that's no real handicap, and it does try to cover not only the shows but also some of the movers and shakers, websites, available paraphernalia, urban legends (like the whole Captain Pugwash character names thing), etc.The trouble is that this is likely to be of more value to those who haven't been introduced to the shows before - shot through with inaccuracies (the capsule review of ""The Simpsons: Songs in the Key of Springfield"" gets it mixed up with ""The Simpsons Sing the Blues""; ""Danger Mouse"" is touted as the first successful cartoon exported to the US, a point ""Speed Racer"" fans would debate strenuously; ""Danger Man"" and ""Secret Agent"" were the same show, not two different ones...) and not revealling much to those already in the know, it's an okay time-killer in the end, but one for the casual viewer."
5,carpet floor mats,"The holes are a little large for the vehicle studs but the ones that were in there were copy-righted,so I can understand why they came that way,anyhow they worked just fine and fit perfectly."
5,The definitive ant book,"I received a copy of this book back in the early 1990s and have gone back to read it on several occasions. The book is massive consisting of over 730 pages in a large 12 x 10 format. It contains hundreds of illustrations including several color plates and some really amazing paintings of various types of ants and hive culture.The information is exhaustive ranging from the extremely technical to the conversational. Parts of the book will be mainly of interest to the hardcore entomologist but the majority of the book is easily understood by the layman, well maybe not always easily but it's not too difficult and it's worth the effort.I can't imagine a better or more complete text on the subject of ants. Anyone with any real interest in the subject should not be without this book."
3,publisher mistake,wonderful book and full of insite. well written. the material is science but for some reason the publisher made it the size of a coffee table book -- like something you would get for christmas. this makes it unweildy to read and to place on a book case. could have easily been two volume set.
1,A word of caution,"This is the first review on Amazon I have written of a book which I did not finish. I probably have quit reading a book about 30 times in my long life. I do not subscribe to the ""right"" in the Readers' Billl of Rights that I can quit any time I want to when I am reading a book. Furthermore, I try to read all Pulitzer prize-winning books, and have read 100's of such. So I thought I would read this book. About page 160 I decided life was too short to plod thru this very technical book on a subject which I could not get very excited about. I decided to quit reading it; something, as I said, I very seldom do. I was surprised how much better I felt when I realized I was not going to be reading further in the book. So, if you are not ""into"" biology or the related sciences, I suggest you consider whether you really want to read this book. I decided I did not."
3,"Good overview, but some bad advice","This is a very solid wine overview. However, some of the advice is bad. For example, early on the author states that wine purchasers shouldn't worry too much about a wine's vintage or geography. Actually, these two factors are extremely important and crucial to the appreciation of fine wines. Simply stated, Bordeaux wines and Tuscan wines are considerably better in certain. Geography (or terroir) is one of the reasons I will not buy a Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, but I will buy a Barolo or Barbaresco."
1,Complete and utter waste of time.,"It reeked. There is no plot, no storyline, no build-up, no climax, and pretty much no point. The author must feel that he is above proper punctuation because he almost never uses it. I wish I'd saved myself the time and money this book took from me."
2,Not very useful,This book gives a very vague description of each area. I would not start climbing routes based on the description provided. Not all directions to climbing areas are correct. I did a cross country trip in August 2010 and thought this book would be a great resource...I WAS WRONG. Save yourself some money and do some internet research on possible climbing locations for areas you will be visiting.
4,Good quality for the price.,"I don't use it for sticks, but rather for wooden fifes. The arrangement of the interior pockets is effective."
1,This is a LARGE stick bag and the worst!!! I've ever owned!!,Length:: 2:12 MinsThis drum stick bag is fairly LARGE compare to my DW stick bag.It appears to be well made with a large zipper to grab hold to.My DW bag zipper broke after many years so I thought I would give this bag a try.had I known how large this bag was I might have stuck with the DW.Even though it was smaller it seems to hold just a much as this larger bag.Let's hope it holds up as well as my DW bag. UPDATE: this bag is the worst!!my drum keys and everything in the side pocket falls out All the time!!the velcro does not hold well and there is a big gap!!wish I had bought my DW bag again which I will!! this bag is a piece of poo!! dung!!!cak-ka!! you get the point..lol buy at yur own risk check out my video first!!
5,very professionally done,"I have been listening for religious references in music in 2007. In this case, it's a good thing. I don't listen to music enough to keep track of what I already have, but I knew the ""Jerusalem Tomorrow"" on this CD was one song I had to hear. I had forgotten how effectively Emmylou just talks through the verses of that song, only singing for an ""Ah, Oh, woe"" at the very end. The music is great, telling the story as well as she does. It is a great story. The other songs have a good range of themes with some religious images popping up occasionally, but ""Jerusalem Tomorrow"" is so totally religious, the urge to tag along with an attitude of ""What could go wrong?"" appeals so strongly to all of us."
3,Cowgirl's Prayer,Not as good as usual but not bad considering her age. The instrumentation could have been better.
5,Good mystery,I chose this rating because I love mysteries and I will not ever stop reading A to Z mystery books because they are the number one mystery books ever i think this is the best one out of the 26 books i haven't read all of them yet but I will soon I read 17 and all i have left is 9 books I don't know when I'm going to read them but it will probably be like next week well I'll start next week and end them in like two to three weeks
5,Great. Excellent book,I love this book my favorite part is when mr dillon played a trick on them my favorite book is a to z mysteries
5,Good product,"It fit very well on my vehicle, and was easy to install. The price was very reasonable."
3,not bad,"The uke came with all the string s in the wrong places, overall it looks okay but what a pain having to take all the strings off and re do it all. Makes me worry about the rest of the quality if they are too lazy to do the simple things right."
2,not good enough for 50 bucks,"I wanted a cheap Ukulele, one that I could learn the basics on. Unfortunately this product goes out of tune in about 20 minutes so I can't recommend it to anyone who isn't completely sure what the note they're playing sounds like. Perhaps my ire should be directed more at the strings, but for 50$ you'd think they'd kick in for some decent ones. If you can restring it with some better ones you might have better luck, otherwise, look elsewhere."
3,"Decent for the price, good for a beginner.","I bought this because I wanted to try out playing a ukulele. Although I'm not a professional or experienced musician by any means, I did notice that the third fret was off which seems to be a common problem. Also the strings sit really high over the fretboard. Despite those two things I've found it easy enough to play and quite a bit of fun. It's a good buy for figuring out if playing a uke is going to be for you. I don't regret buying it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading to a more serious one."
3,Worth the money.,"After reading other reviews on this Ukulele I expected better. Will not keep in tune at all.The finish is not as good as some have said theirs is. They call this a ""Concert Ukulele"". Sounds good in name only. You get what you pay for. Looks just ok for the money. Does make a nice addition for the music room."
3,Nice uke,Nice for the price. Strings a little high but playable. Good construction great looks. Put new Aquila strings on it and sounds great.
5,So much more than I had hoped for,"At such a modest price point, I expected a toy ukelele. I was pleasantly surprised when I first started strumming. This is a quality instrument. My boyfriend learned very quickly and we are looking into purchasing a second Oscar Schmidt ukelele for myself!"
4,oscar schmidt ou2 ukulele,I bought this ukuele for my grandaughter's 8th birthday. I play the guitar and had her playing 4 chord progressions for me in two days. This is not a toy. The fretboard and tuners are very nice for a level entry instrument. I'd recommend it for anyone wanting to learn to play.
3,Okay for a beginner,"Yes, this is an unbeatable value and a good uke to learn on, but it doesn't sound all that great compared to say any recording you may ever hear. It is definitely not a toy, though. Stays in tune fairly well. I replaced my strings with Aquila strings and lowered the action and it sounds and plays much better. All in all, this is the best value I could find for something to learn on, but now I'm eager to get something better."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed. The ukulele is cheaply made, looks cheap, too.And it won't stay in tune. Now I have to pay for someone to take a look and see what's wrong with it. I should have returned it."
1,Really low quality ukulele,"I received the Uke in good time and there were no problems with the shipping. The problem was that this uke would never stay in tune for more than a couple minutes. It is more like a toy than a real ukulele. If a child's toy is what you want then buy this, if not, I would go with one of a little better quality. You get what you pay for."
2,WANTED A BETTER UKE,"After ordering this OU2 I read that The OU5 is better quality, better tone, wood, more fret space and easier to learn than the OU2.I did not like the tone of the OU2 and found it difficult to tune I felt I was playing with a toy and the wood finish was not as attractive as the OU5.I returned the 2 and am enjoying the 5. I did not mind the additional cost (about$100)."
4,good choice,"As I approach 60, I wanted to learn to play a musical instrument. I remember we had a ukulele in the house when I was a boy in the 50's. And so began my research. I found the Oscar Schmidt OU2 concert ukulele on Amazon and with the discount it fit perfectly into my budget. I play every day and have thoroughly enjoyed the instrument. I was concerned that I may not have payed enough for a quality instrument. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am more than pleased as a new player. It holds a tune quite well and is just the right size for me. I highly recommend this instrument to anyone who is considering learning to play a ukulele."
4,A great starter uke,"My first ukulele (I have some experience on guitar and bass) and I'm very pleased with it so far. The strings are so-so, but I figure I'll have to replace them in a few months anyway. Definitely give them some time to settle and stretch, dont' expect it to stay in tune well for at least a few days of regular playing. Overall a very nice sound and quality for the price. Would definitely recommend."
1,It only lasted for a year :(,"I've bought it in 01/08/01, started to use it on February (It was bought on the USA) and it was doing fine, untill some weeks ago. Now it seems not to recognize the blank media. I'm dissapointed because I thought Phillips was a good brand of electronics :("
1,MY PHILIPS CD MODEL PCRW804K17,I HAVE THIS PHILIPS MODEL PCRW804K17 AND I HAVE TRY TO INSTALL IT BUT WOULDN`T WORK. I HAVE INSTALLED IT BUT WOULD NOT READ THE CD. I DON`T KNOW IF THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE INSTALL WITH A DRIVER OR NOT HOW DO I MAKE IT WORK? DO I NEED A DRIVERHELP
1,Exercise caution,"I purchased this type of CDRW and had problems from the start. The store I purchased it from refused to accept it back unless the manufacturer provided proof it was defective.When I contacted the Philips Tech group, all I received was automated messages about how to install the device and a number to call if that didn't work. When I called the number, they told me my operating system was defective. When I installed a different operating system and the CDRW still didn't work, they told me it was my computer. when I replaced my computer, they told me the warranty was over. When I went to look for technical data on the CDRW, the Philips USA website was unable to locate the CDRW type PCRW804K17 or even PCRW804. I would recommend trying a product from a different company. My CDRW does make a moderately good placeholder for an empty computer bay."
1,BAD BURNER BLUES,"Just got a PCRW804K17 on ebay for $12.00. I thought WOW!! What a deal!!! Sure, it was an older model, but was in mint condition. I soon found out why. It never worked, therefore was never used. This piece of JUNK does not work with XP, and apparently from all the other reviews (and searching myself) Philips has not released drivers for XP. After searching Philips website, it appears they tried to cover up making this drive. I only wish I had did my homework (reading reviews) before placing a bid."
1,"Never worked, and customer support sucks","Bad dirve, bad service. Will never touch phlips computer hardware again.They said they will call you back with a solution, they never did. And it happened more than once.(BTW, I am a computer geek. Do not tell me I do not know how to install a cdrw drive. It even wont recongize a music cd)."
2,disappointed,"didn't want to subject 9 yr old grandson to some objectionable parts. prefer wholesome, uplifting content. i sent itr back."
4,This book is good,"Macaroni boy is a very good read. I think everyone should read it. It tells about life during the great depression. We had to read as a class book, so everytime we stopped i wanted to read some more."
4,Quality large tambourine,Bought this as a gift for my mom and she has grown to love it. At first she complained that it was too large and awkward to use but over time she realized that it was also a percussion instrument that you can beat like a drum on your hip and with your hand and that its large size makes it easier to use.I myself like the quality of the instrument; it's certainly no toy and has some weight to it and doesn't feel cheap. The gold trim with the black background of the Praying Hands artwork also caught my eye as well.Overall this is a quality product but keep in mind that this tambourine is larger than average and might be uncomfortable for petite women and children. Now if only they can have some artwork on the tambourine that accommodates Pastafarians...
5,One of the greatest albums ever,"I've been listening to songs off this album for probably four years. I finally decided I'd like the physical thing, so I bought it. It's fantastic. There isn't a single disappointing song on it. Blue October is one of my favorite bands and this is their best album. You should probably get it."
4,Almost there,"I really like a majority of the songs on this abum BUT I can't say I like all em'. This is just my opnion but what I really like about this band is they have a ""Pink Floyd"" feel to thier lyrics. The music isn't Pink Floyd but the use of words is what made me think of P.F. and Roger Waters (Before he went overboard political on us)."
1,Unfortunately...,"When I tried to play this CD, it would not read on any CD player. I tried 4 different players and the CD showed up as ""blank""."
1,Don't do it....,"I bought this CD because I loved the song ""Hate Me""....now I hate myself for having endured the rest of the CD. If you have never heard of Blue October but love the song ""Hate Me"" borrow the CD before you buy it. This band sounds like masculine version of Celine Dion."
1,Dear lord make it stop!!!,"I bought this cd before hearing the song released on the radio. I figured I would take a gamble and try something I haven't heard of, which ended up being one of the biggest mistakes ever made by me as a consumer.I can honestly say that I would rather have my fleshed seared off by nuclear radiation than have to listen to this cd again. If I were in Hell, this would be the soundtrack playing in the background. If you have ever experienced suicidal thoughts, DO NOT PUCHASE THIS CD as it will probably be just the thing to push you over the edge. Instead of wasting a good 12 bucks, take a nail gun and repeatedly fire shots thorough your ears as the effect is similar.I tried giving this cd away for free to 2 different co-workers only to have them return it to me in disgust. Save your money and your soul and purchase something else."
4,defies classification,"Ok, like millions of other music fans, I heard ""Hate Me"" and ""loved it"". So I went out and bought the CD, and was pleasantly surprised and impressed. It's a great album! I'm surprised this band isn't way more popular. This is one of those CDs which could easily spawn many singles-there are some really great, catchy tunes here. There is something for everyone: some of the songs are harder than others, others are more pop, but they are all really quite good. Highly recommended!"
4,must have album,This is one of the best albums of 2006. Covering a broad array of musical styles this album takes you from misery to bliss in 13 tracks.
1,Who buys this stuff?,"I wish to give this a poor review, but obviously someone out there likes this garbage. I still can't figure out why though. The one hit... ""Hate Me"" is the only good, catchy tune. However, it throws the F-bomb out in the middle of the song. If you are someone who does not like that, be careful. As for the remaining songs, they are worthless."
4,A Normal Boy,"From the opening lyric of ""Into the Ocean,"" Blue October grabs you with its unique sound, the throbbing beat and complex lyric, ""I'm just a normal boy that sank when I fell overboard. The ship would leave the country. But I'd rather swim ashore. Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again; Wish I was much more masculine."" The catchy hook is addictive. My other favorite on this disc is ""X Amount of Words"" that is lyrically jammed with Justin Furstenfeld's breathy vocals and stadium crowd sound effects, ""Systematic, sympathetic, quite pathetic, apologetic, paramedic, your heart is prosthetic."" The tracks are so original that they jump out of the speakers. ""Let It Go"" & ""She's My Ride Home"" also capture attention. ""Foiled"" is a great disc! ""Enjoy!"""
5,An Very Well Crafted Compilation of Songs!,"Blue October as with fine Bourbon or Wine gets better with every passing moment of time. Justin and Company hit home with many different people in identifying with life's experiences, good and bad, I inclusive. The clarity of the vocal talent backed with the generous helpings of musical talent, make a complete package, nothing missing as with a number of music groups today. Blue October, Live Long, Stay True and Prosper Well."
3,Review of Letter to Young Churches,"I love this version of the epistles in the New Testament--they are very readable, and enjoyed the introduction by C.S.. Lewis. Unfortunately, the copy I purchased has a musty smell."
4,Used this as a secondary book during semester,"My grad school class used this book to supplement and get a different type of explanation to specifically tricky concepts. We did not use it as the main book so it was not read in it's entirety. But was very different than our primary book (author is a professor from Berkley), so it served its purpose and I am glad I bought it."
3,Good but not his greatest.,"This gets actually 3.5 stars. Alladin Sane. An Album that many Bowie fans argue about wether it's good , bad, his worst or his best. This album doesn't have any unique premise about it. It's in the same direction as Ziggy Stardust. The LP has good arrangements, the blocket is nice and the front cover is excellent. some of the songs including the title track are great but somethings are missing. this album has a bit of Rolling Stones feel to it and sometimes difficult in listen. It has a bit a mixture of both glam and 50's and 60's rock but the LP's missing something really important but I do not know exactly what it is. But overall a good effort that you should check out."
5,Marc Bolan,"I've read before a rumor that Marc Bolan played guitar on one of the tracks, but due to contractual entrapments, he was not credited. I always thought it was ""Jean Genie."" Any takers on the bet?"
4,Watch That Man!,"Watch That Man is one of the many Bowie songs that changed my life. Of course I love Alladin Sane and Cracked Actor, but Watch That Man was just pure rock. Bowie, who is excellent on just about every album, creates this lively and hip album that everybody should hear. Great music, great fun, and everything else that's good is in this album."
5,One of the greatest rock albums of all time!!!,"Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. It is the benchmark by which other other albums are judged... as any Beatle album is used as a benchmark. The production, the songs, the performances (especially by guitarist Mick Ronson, who was way ahead of his time, and pianist Mike Garson), make this a classic. From the straight ahead rock of ""Watch That Man"" and ""Cracked Actor"", to the avant-gard jazz stylings of ""Aladdin Sane"", the chugging drive of ""Panic In Detroit"", to the Broadway meets Glam Rock stylings of ""Time"", to his classic interpretation of ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" (which would be a precursor to his ""Pin-Ups"" album) - this is David Bowie at the peak of his creativity. This is one album I have listened to non-stop since the day I first bought it in the early 70's, and I still hear something new and exciting each time I put it on."
3,Glamorous and exciting !,"I purchased the 30th Anniversary Double-Disc version in Hanover, Mass. in 2007. I picked up a used version for $10 or $11. It was worth it for that price, for sure. I got a little bit nostalgic last year and I also purchased some Lou Reed, Frank Zappa and Jackson Browne and Grateful Dead. I like all of these artists and their recordings, too. Aladdin Sane sounds very good next to Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, too. Bowie has a sense of humor and that means a lot as I get older."
5,Manic poetic majesty and beautifully raunchy guitar work.,"This album is a necessity, you need to hear ""Panic in Detroit"", ""The Jean Genie"", ""The Prettiest Star"", you need to hear all of these songs, they are gems, all of them (as is the treatment of the Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together""). The whole album creates a brave new world (one that we are living in now), with Bowie's manic poetic majesty and Mick Ronson's beautifully raunchy textured guitar work. Bowie and Ronson were an otherworldly type of Jagger/Richards phenomenon (but, alas, without the longevity)."
5,The Ultimate Glam Rock Album!,"Bowie was arguably at his peak when he released ""Aladdin Sane"". Every song was a potential hit single, with ""Jean Genie"" taking the honors. Hard-core lyrics and cutting-edge guitars drove this collection into millions of homes. ""Watch That Man"" (covered by Lulu!) and ""Cracked Actor"" brought in the hilarious vocal antics of the ... Bowie while ""Drive-In Saturday Night"" bounces along like a teenage dream date. One of the most impressive songs here is ""Panic In Detoit"", a relentless beat of a song with a wondrous overload of congos and screaming background vocals. The entire collection begs re-listening, but it's so good, I guess RYKO felt no additional songs or outtakes were needed to sell this album. Rock it with that devishish attitude!"
1,A pointless book; save your money!,"This book is dire! A mixture of supposed ""real"" conversations between cross cultural couples which enforce every stereotype you have ever come across! The dialogue is tedious and wooden and reads as though it has been translated from a 1970's teen magazine by a robot. There are some useful phrases but you can find them in other, more useful books such as Philip Yungkin Lee's ""Listening to Canotonese Basic Skills""Such a shame after the useful ""No Sweat Cantonese"" book. Save your money!"
2,I found it so poor!,"I got really excited when i bought this book, but when i received it i got really disappointed of my purchase, i thought it would be a full colored book, with a lot of pictures to help you and give you some project ideas, but it has just a few of them and has about 10 pictures of candles that are not so amazing, i think you should get another book if you want some ideas for gel candlemaking"
1,I should have read the reviews,I was very disappointed with this book....I saw it listed on the Internet and it was recommended by some of the web sights. The information in this book is on the Internet and the projects are not that great or challenging. The book has eight pages of color picture. I checked many of the suppliers listed in the back of the book and quite a few no longer have web pages. I truly expected more from this book based on all of the hype. I feel your money would be better spent on another book.
2,You can spend your money better elsewhere.,"I was expecting more detailed step by step instructions & full of color photos with lots of inspirations. But instead, most of the info. from the book are knowledge you can get FREE from websites that sell gel candle supplies. There are only a few pages of gel candle examples & they are not too impressive.The only good thing about the book is that the author has included resource of different suppliers."
2,i guess it's ok...,"I own the Original London Cast version of The Phantom of the Opera and I've seen the musical many times, and this is only my opinion, but I think the singer who sings as the phantom on this CD sings like he's getting choked by someone while he sings, and it also does not include the ""Music of the Night"" which is one of the main songs on the musical, so I wouldn't call this CD the HIGHLIGHTS from the Phantom of the Opera."
3,KYRA BRONTE,"This is the recording with Kyra Bronte so if you already have the recording with Michael Heate and Kyra Bronte do not buy this, this is the same recording"
4,cuba,A colorful well laid out book with good use of photographs in the National Geo style taken by a optimistic photographer with a quirky eye that obviously has a lot of passion for this country. looking forward to the next one.
1,yet another foreign stereotype,"David Alan Harvey yet again follows in the venerable western tradition of essentializing a culture that is not his own and that he does not understand. Could this book be called ""Poverty postcards from the edge""? Or perhaps ""Fantasy visions of a people time forgot""? No, I've got it, ""Women who won't talk to me but I'll photograph in their bikinis on the beach"". But that is also a little of his current Brazil work. I've got a message for you Harvey, the US Census 2010 shows non-white births out-number white births. Before you know it other voices of the non-white are going to have harsh words for your Orientalist fantasies."
3,it was alright! it could have been much better!,This book was an easy read! I really think that it could have been much better! As I was reading it I felt like I was about three years old!
1,Insulting to Cubans,"This book should have been called ""Two Gringos Go to Cuba"". It is insulting to Cuban people everywhere, whether they live in Cuba now or other places. The book seems to say that poverty is something that is fun to look at it and should be photographed. Most of the photographs are too dark or out of focus anyhow. If you want to buy a book about Cuba, get one written by a Cuban."
5,Fantastic score.,"It's hard to believe the budget was small for this, considering how big and epic the score sounds. Excellent action cues and perfect sound quality make this a must-buy for action/horror music fans. Mr. Salvay needs more work. It's hard to believe this is the man who gave us the themes to ""Full House"" and ""Family Matters."""
1,Worthless,"This book provides nothing more than a simple overview of what every person involved in a business (from entry-level to executive) should already know. The book provides no additional insight into actually surviving in a fast-paced, competitive and difficult marketplace than you should already have.The book has no solid foundation nor does it provide anything outside of standard, common, well-known, proven practices for building one of your own."
4,Borrowed reviews,"To borrow from other reviewers I found this book to be ""engrossing"" and ""not overly exciting"" and ""a bit slow"".I enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars though."
1,IT SUX!!!,She should have left this song alone! Brenda K. Starr's version had more heart and heat than Mariah's breathy version. She doesn't even belt the song out like Brenda did.
2,Mariah Sounds Annoying,"I usually love Mariah's voice but she sounds really annoying on this song, like she needs to clear her throat or something. Also, you can tell Ms. Carey didn't write this song herself (it's a Brenda K. Starr cover) because the lyrics aren't up to her usual standard. They're boring and not particuarly meaningful. But Mariah's worst is better than some other artists' best, so it's still a worthwhile purchase."
3,OK,"the remixes of this song are the bomb, especially the one with Mocha + Amil. But the original version blows, 'nuff said."
5,She's got me feeling higher!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is really awesome! Mariah can sing anything she wants, and sound really great!! I love this single. Everyone who appreciates high quality music, will enjoy this very much. Breanda K. Starr must feel honored to have her song performed by this great artist!! Thanks Breanda, for hiring her as your background singer & introducing to the world, Mariah Carey!!"
1,mariah scarey can't sing,if mariah spend more time practice singing rather than sleeping with all those rappers then maybe she would sound better.
3,Mariah Carey---not what she used to be,"I am disappointed in what M. Carey has done to her voice--what a great sound she was in the beginning of her career. Now, from all the screaming and trying to imitate others, she has lost her true sound. The voice is half clear--half scratchy. If she remains as is in the present, I think she will soon be one in the past!"
2,Hideous; saved by Da Brat and Krayzie Bone on track 4,"When Mariah remade ""I still believe"", she ripped out the beauty from the song, making it really quite devastating. The remixes aren't much better, especially the way ""The King's Mix"" (available on this CD, but not listed on Amazon's track list) ruins what Mariah managed to make tolerable.The ""Clean"" remix is dumb, the ""Morales classic club"" is horrendous, and the best thing on here is the ""Pure Imagination"" mix, which Mariah seems very well backed up by Da Brat and Krayzie Bone, while still finally holding her own and being GOOD. Thank God she was convinced to do that remix because this cd would've been left with no stars at all otherwise."
4,I LUV THAT SONG AND CD!!!!,"I luv that song, I still believe. I think Mariah Carey sings that tooo beautifully. She's the bomb, and I can't wait until her next CD, Go Mariah!!!!!:):):)"
4,"Good, as far as singles go","This CD is worth it just for ""Pure Imagination"" -- the familiar riff from the movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Very creative....one of the best remixes out there, and Mariah usually has great remixes anyway. Also worth checking out is the ""I Still Believe"" version by Brenda K. Starr. Both hers and Mariah's are good, but nothing tops the original."
5,Mariah's awesome!,"Once again, Mariah Carey has done it. Proving that she's one of the best singers around! The newest CD called #1's was just breath-taking! I especially loved the song ""I Still Believe"". Even though it is a re-make of the original, she sings it so inspiratonal! The whole album is so cool because it has all the songs that were the best. It definitely was worth the money I spent. Mariah is one of the best female pop stars around."
3,Scanner is a little tricky!! But Daughter LOVES this!,"My 4 year old asked for this over and over for Christmas - thankfully Grammie came through! It is a cute, durable toy. Batteries ARE included! You scan items and get the english and spanish words for common things - however you have to line the scanner up just perfectly with the arrows on the item cards or it doesn't scan correctly - it becomes very frustrating when you see one thing but hear another thing scan!! It will total your purchases and give you the total in ""dora dollars"". On the shopping adventure mode - it doesn't recognize ""wrong"" item scans - after 3 items - it totals.The credit card reader is fun - but do I really want my 4 year old learning how to use credit??It is cute and fun! My daughter has had hours of fun with it and her older siblings and cousin really enjoyed it too!!!"
3,birhtday present,"this was a birthday present it was a cool toy and fun to play with. the only problem was that the machine can not read the scanner thing. i would recommend this for a 4,5,or6 year olds."
4,Better than others say,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I was a little worried because of other reviews, but on Christmas day, she loved it. She has never put it down since and it works just fine. And it's not as loud as others say. Great toy."
3,"ok toy, but not great","I got this toy for my 3 year old. She likes it overall, but it is difficult to get the items to scan correctly, if it scans at all. She likes the credit card scan and play money. It is built well, very solid construction, but the scan feature needs improvement."
2,Not worth it,"This was one of my dora-mad 3 year old daughter for Christmas. The scanner is REALLY difficult to work, it took me a while to get it right, and she just got bored trying. It should have a screen where the prices show as you scan them , but it doesn't. The pad to sign for credit card purchases is really lame. All in all a big let down."
2,Buy Something Else!,"This toy does not work well. It doesn't scan the correct item half the time, and it's just not worth the $40 dollars I paid for it. My girls have enjoyed it, but probably only because it talks and sounds like Dora. I usually like to read reviews before I purchase something like this, but I took my 3 year old out on her birthday and this is what we came home with. Please do not support this item and maybe they will revisit and fix it. It has good concepts, but just isn't made well. Read the other reviews about what is wrong with this."
3,"E o Tchan - Music from Bahia, Brazil","This was the first Brazilian band to play Axe Music. Axe Music had origin in Bahia, Brazil. This Cd has recent music that make a lot of success in Brazil. E o tchan, sold millions of copies of the cd in Brazil, the Brazilians like a lot, but perhaps other people don't like so much as the Brazilians. The best music are: Bate Tchan, Regae Tchan, Tribotchan."
4,The best versions of their songs are here,"Not many live albums give good songs their due, unless they're hard rockers or blues, but these renditions are superb. It functions as a ""best hits"" collection if you don't know 10K. ""Gold Rush Brides"" gives me chills."
3,Natalie's Last Stand,"Little known fact: 10,000 Maniacs appeared on Unplugged in both of it's versions: the more well-known version that everyone and their mother seems to be on, and the original version, which was more focused on modern folk bands.In any case: this CD was the last recording before Natalie Merchant left the band. It serves, in a strange way, as a Greatest Hits album. So why do I listen to it and just not get as worked up as I do for Like The Weather or Blind Man Zoo? Maybe a part of it is that I've never been enamored with the Unplugged series. I just didn't seem to get the idea that the band was into it. I give the idea that you could do better, in this case, to go for one of the earlier albums, and proceed from there."
3,Adequate,"The 10,000 Maniacs did not utilize the principle of ""unplugged"" like they should have. Instead, this is a collection of watered down versions of the original tunes. Acoustic guitar is losing its form, and it's because of MTV's unplugged shows."
5,Beautifully Done,I think that in this performance for MTv Ms. Merchant lets her personality really shine through and solidly puts her stamp on each song. The mix of songs is excellant and Natalie's voice is divine as usual. From the catchy These are the Days and Candy Everybody Wants to the ecletic Eat for Two this album is first rate. Ms. Merchants unique voice and elegant style rein supreme on this effort. A must have CD for any Merchant or Maniacs fan.
5,Uno de los mejores discos que he escuchado,"Si hay que calificar este CD la palabra es simplemente maravilloso, alla por 1994 escuche ""Because the night"" y quedo almacenada en mi memoria hasta que aqui en Amazon logre explorar mas de este disco y de la musica de 10,000 maniacs y quede totalmente enamorado de la voz de Merchant, ojala siga produciendo musica para deleyte de sus fans y el mio propio."
1,No maniac here,"I was not a maniac before I bought this album and I'm still not a maniac. The only song that I liked from this album was ""because the night."" I just could not get into the other songs because the other songs didn't have the same feel as ""because the night."" I'd buy this used, but not new."
4,Easy Breezy Like A Sunday Morning,"This album flows musically and it's nice to have on for background music or if you just want to unwind and chill. My favourite song is Because The Night, I love the lyrics of that song. The only songs I felt were average were the last 2. They sounded to somber and it makes you want to just end the album prematurally."
4,Do you speak american?,"One of Jerry Angulio's favorite sayings do you speak american..$$$. At any rate, this a good account on the Boston mafia and New England Underboss Jery Anguilio's. It tells how he got his start after being in the navy in ww 2 becoming a bookmaker and early on almost getting whacked for making a blunder. He eventually rose in the mafia ranks despite never having actually personally killed anyone himself although he would order many hits. He actually at one time wanted to be a lawyer and was one of the first mafioso to Realize that RICO could become what it has becom and ironically his family would be the first proving ground trial that RICO would be used against LCN successfully. He wasn't all that well like even among mafia ranks but made a ton of money. FBI breaks ins to wire his social club would bring down him and many other Boston LCN members instead of the supposed info Whitey Bulger gave to the FBI."
4,"One of the better Mafia books, I've read.",New stories about the Cosa Nostra in New England. Not the same old rehashing of the transitions of the New York families.Interesting reading!
5,Great Overview of E-Commerce Management,E-Volve-or-die.com is loaded with tons of ideas to help you build your e-business and information on how to create strategies that are the most critical for e-volving towards the future. He is very connected to e-commerce management and you can tell in his writings in this book. This book goes into all different aspects of ECM in detail and is a great book for a complete overview of where e-commerce management is now and where we are heading. Recommended to all interested in e-business or just curious about the Internet Age.
4,Good Foundation to start from,This book lays the foundation for people new to the operational side of a business. The book demonstrates and demystfies some of the myths surround e-commerce. There's good insight from prominent folks in the hi-tech industry who truly understand how to leverage the Internet.
1,Beginner's info,"Throughout the whole book (I did not finish it all the way) I got the impression the dude was full of himself and wanted to communicate at all cost how good he is. The book is not written in a very professional way. Info kind of lame and generic. Did not learn anything new at all. If you ran out of sleeping pills, you might consider reading this book."
4,The Essential Mondo Rock,"This is a 2CD set. The 1st CD is probably the best one with a lot of tracks that were regularly played on the radio in the 80's, such a Summer of '81, State of the heart, Cool World, Chemistry, Come Said the boy and Rule of threes. The 2nd CD is mainly B sides but is still enjoyable."
4,Excellent narrative of 1800's Western U.S. female doctor.,"The story covers the trials and tribulations of a singlefemale doctor coping with the hardships of living inthe western U.S. in the late 1800's. The medical &daily language used is authentic and reminiscent ofthat period. Very easy reading filled with heartwarming experiences. The story is based on the life of a truepioneer woman Dr. Susan Anderson struggling foracceptance in the harsh environment of the lumbercamps, gold mines and railroad towns of the Rockies."
5,Delightful,Delightful novel based on a real life female doctor during the gold rush and after in the Colorado mountains. I really enjoyed this book.
5,Up there with the best.,Possibly his best album. 'It Gets Better' and 'Get Up On It' are legendary KS tracks!! Old school gone modern.
1,IN THE RAIN,"I LOVE KEITH SWEAT,WHEN I WAS GROING UP BACK IN THE 80S I LOVED THIS GUY NAMED NATHEN MATOS AND I STILL DO,WERE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE,BUT KEITH SWEAT SONGS REMIND ME OF HIM SO MUCH I THINK HE IS THE GREATEST ARTIST EVER AND IAM A BIG FAN OF HIS MUSIC.GOD BLESS HIS VOICE AND TALENT,HOPE HE KEEPS SINGING TILL IM OLD AND GRAY."
3,Consistent 90's R&B,"Keith Sweat has always been one of my favourite artists since his debut album 'Make It Last Forever'. 'Get Up On It' is an album awash with synth ballads for the bedroom and mid-tempo beat grooves. Stand-out tracks include 'It Gets Better', 'Get Up On It' (featuring Kut Klose) and 'Put Your Loving Through The Test' (featuring the talents of Roger Troutman). Although Keith can achieve more, this will satisfy anybody wanting to invest in a good 90's R&B album."
2,Average,This Disc has only two Songs that really stand out Get Up On It with kut Klose&Put Your Lovin' Thru The Test with the Late Great Roger Troutman.Keith Swaet is Capable of Better than this.
5,my favorite cd,"I LOVE this CD for times I want peace and serenity. The music is amazing and beautiful. I have a number of other CDs for quiet, relaxing music but this is my favorite by far."
3,SEQUELS FALL SHORT.,"I ENJOYED THIS ONE, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE ORIGINAL. I GUESS MOST SEQUELS JUST DON'T QUITE MAKE IT. AT ANY RATE, I INTEND TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION, EVENTUALLY, AND ENJOY SEEING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."
3,That Croc Chomps 'Em Up Good!,"Bank robbers, a highjacking, AND a giant killer crocodile in the same movie! What more could you ask for?"
1,Oh Please!,Was it really neccessary to throw in the topless shots of the girls?I'm watching this hokey movie about a giant lizard which was mildly entertaining and in the middle of nowhere here are these topless girls frolicking in the water. ?????Can someone tell me why?This movie went in the trash with the other garbage..........
3,Good movie.,This was a fairly good thriller movie. Though that crocodile was pretty scary. A little too scary and quite huge as well. I saw this on tv and was pleased with it so I decided to buy it. Though I still liked Lake Placid more because it had some humor. This one just had a bit too much killing but overall was still enjoyable movie.
2,It doesn't comapre to its predecessor,"After seeing Crocodile for the first time, I was actually looking forward to the sequel. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to even those standards.For one thing, there's too much focus on the criminal gang even after the movie gets going and it's just not interesting.At one point, it starts to get interesting when none of the male characters match the profile of the lead male in this type of movie. A few minutes later, what do you know, Mr. Generic Hero is introduced and on his way to everyone else."
4,Fun,"Crocodile 2 is almost as much fun as the first one. The CGI effects are ok, and some of the crocodile deaths were done well (the death roll). The plot was a little bit silly and the bad guys were such WANNABES! Who else wanted to go into the screen and beat them over the head?! They were so annoying! f this and f that. The movie was pretty good, but it would have been alot better, had the bad guys been killed alot earlier. (like that bad guys just got them to the swamp, were eaten and then the people were left to survive on their own.) If you liked the first one, then you will probobly like this one. The gore was okay, and the acting was very good on the part of the flight assistant. Wortha rental. I bought it to complete my collecton for a very low price.OVERALL SCORE:78plot:15/20direction: 16/20cast: 15/20fun:18/20special effects:17/20"
2,ANACONDA meets THE REF,"Ok, now this was stupid. Several foul-mouthed thieves toting guns that never need reloading cause a plane to crash into a Mexican swamp with several hostages. Next thing you know, there's a huge crocodile chasing them around trying toeat them beacause they killed its baby.Does the ""croc's-killing-spree-brought-on-by-harm-to-it's-children"" part sound familier? It should. It's the same reason the crocodile started killing people in the first film.Bad effects, so-so acting, and an over-use of profanity bring an entertaining monster movie worthy of at least three stars down to a 2/5.And the DVD transition is bloody awful. Plus, all we get for special features is trailers for this film, OCTOPUS 2: RIVER OF FEAR, which was also pretty bad, and Tobe Hopper's CROCODILE."
5,Lopez is amazing!,"I have followed Jennifers career for many years now, and her THIS IS ME THEN album is my favorite. It was at the height of her Bennifer era, and it really reflects her at the time. You have so much passion and love in it, it's relatable and touching at times. Jennifer has mad star quality and this awesome edition of the album is for any JLo fan!!!!"
3,clinical lab management,"The seller is excellent--product was in great condition and arrived quickly. The book itself is less than desirable. The book is badly written, and the answers to the questions at the end of each chapter can hardly be answered using the information within the chapters."
4,Nice Presentation of a Touchy Subject,"This video nicely presents a fairly balanced view between the Jewish revolutionaries and the Roman Empire they rebel against. Many programs either make the Romans saints or villains, or present the revolutionaries as saints or villains, but this one strives to strike a balance. It doesn't always succeed, but it does try.I have shown it to may class, and they didn't mutiny, which is rare for documentaries. So, if it can keep high school students interested, it must be pretty good."
2,Even the Title is Wrong,What can you say about an historical documentary that has an error in the TITLE?? The 66 revolt was NOT the last Jewish Revolt against the Romans. That happened 60 years later under Bar Koupcha and is hardly mentioned in this video.
4,We head Westward,"Hey all fans of Saiyuki Reload and Gunlock, the soundtrack of the series has been heard. It's almost the perfect collection of beginning, ending, and background themes. The only reason i say this is because the one background song that no one knows the title of, yet absolutely loves as the piano music, from the clip of Sanzo trying to sneak out of the bedroom while half dead as Gojyo watches, then puts him back to bed,is not in this collection. Everything else from all the openings and closings; by BUZZ LIP, Wag, and ID; funny backgrounds, and battle music are here in this cd with the added bonus of the original Japanese cast sound corrections is very entertaining to listen to. If you like Saiyuki Reload and Gunlock, and a huge fan of jazz, brass, calming, and pop/rock styles of music, I recommend you consider adding this to your collection. We go west to the setting sun."
5,Dream Pop At Its Best!,"Bewitched is a classic that should not go unnoticed. Being from the South it was by chance that I was even introduced to Luna by my 8th grade science teacher. He let me borrow Bewitched and my music tastes forever changed. From the bouncy, happy, opening notes of ""California(all the way)"" to the slow trance-like bassline of ""Sleeping Pill""this album leaves a smile on your face and ultimately a feeling of true satisfaction. Definitely worthy of all 5 stars!"
5,I luv Luna,"""When did my sympathy turn to malice?"" I will rave about any CD that contains lyrics like that. Wow. I love Luna's little pop action they've got going on. It's calming and peaceful to listen to. Perfect for relaxing prior to going to bed."
3,Uneven Sophomore Album,"Luna's second album ""Bewitched"" contains the band's best song, the absolutely hypnotizing ""Tiger Lilly."" Unfortunately, the rest of the album fails to live up to that high point. Leader Dave Wareham is a decent singer and guitarist, but his wacky lyrics have been something of an acquired taste dating back to his days with Galaxie 500. Luna has made a career out of mining the sonic territory first established by the Velvet Underground, but their words often undermine their efforts. That said, in addition to ""Tiger Lily,"" ""California (All the Way),"" ""Friendly Advice"" and ""Going Home,"" are the other high points. The rest of the material is somewhat bland, without any real standouts. Perhaps because of self-consciousness, no lyrics sheet is included.Overall, an uneven album from an ecclectic and quirky band."
2,Snooze Fest,"I have no idea where the Velvet Underground comparisons come from in relation to Luna. The singer resembles Lou Reed only in the sense that he occasionally (actually, more than occasionally) sings off-key, but he sounds an awful lot more like an upper west-side latte wimp, than Lou Reed's late 60s, early 70s Alphabet City junkie. The music is tuneless (actually, Tiger Lilly is mildly catchy, but that's about it) and has none of the noise or melodic stylings of VU. In short, they sound like a very watered down Galaxy 500. There's so much worthwhile music out there--I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this bland, boring, arthritic stuff."
3,Ever heard of Velvet Underground,"I'll be pithy: O.K., but Lou Reed, VU, and co. did it better the first time around."
4,A good standing desk,"I really like having a desk I can stand at. This one is quite basic, but not too expensive, easy to put together and take apart (I've moved with it twice now), and at the right height. The tray at the bottom is too small to accommodate larger desktops or printers, and the desk that I got had slightly cracked wood for one of the pieces. Still, it was well worth the price, and has served me well. The fact that it rolls is also nice."
4,Good starter,"If you are just interested in trying a stand up desk, this is a good starter for a reasonable price. Decent build quality and easy assembly."
2,If you like antiques,"This book would have been great 15 years ago. Things have changed around the waterways such as described in this book. Very dispointing, especially the critics. I've checked some of the phone numbers and most have been changed. As a matter of fact, the area code for lower Quebec is not 514 but 450 and this since 1990...So do what you like but remember, if your nostalgic, this book is for you. If you like current data, look elsewhere..sorry."
4,Ny Waterways Guide,A thorough compilliation of facts and data for mariners interested in cruising NY and Vermont waterways from the Hudson river up through Lake Champlain and its environs.Well done and very informative. One should have this book with them for planning and cruising.Noah charts must be obtained seperately.
3,I was hoping for a little grease,"I saw this woman live years ago at the Ottawa International Jazz Festival and she blew me away. Not only is she a great singer but she has a winning onstage personality, and the woman is funny. I guess I was hoping this cd would have some of her between song patter. To me that is all part of the live experience, especially since the cd is detailing the songs of her career. There are some stories in there. She is still a great singer, excellent backing musicians, but it needed something to bring it all together."
2,I do not recommend theee for modern computers,"not only are they old design they are clunky at best. I would only recommend for slow(and anceint) PCs dating as far as the K6 II days. I would NEVER stick this in a case with a core duo or any such crazy suicidal thing. their are much better and more effieceint and robust ways of cooling even the most dated cmoputers. great for the old AT case, and a Voodoo 3 card(as in dinosaure) not much else."
3,probably unnecessary,"After doing extensive research on the web about cooling computers and also experimenting with my on PC as the optimal configuration of cooling the inside of the PC, I've concluded that these front fans are probably uncessary. And if you don't mind about ""looks"", then you can always just leave the front bays open and just put a large fan in the front of it.I think an HP site also did some experiments and concluded that front end fans were not only unnecessary, they could also interfere with airflow.In any event I did not see a significant drop in temperature from the use of these fans (although some people have on some other web sites). The only things that have really cooled down the inside of my pc was to either leave the case off (which of course lets dust in everywhere), or to use one of those sideways fans that you put in the PCI slots (where you usually put your soundcard, etc..). Other fans in the back and in the side helped somewhat of course."
3,Just another Pinafore,"Although I don't disagree with the other reviewers I've read on specific points, this Pinafore just doesn't do much for me. Musically, it's very strong, but this recording just doesn't excite me like other Pinafores (NDOC) or other Mackerras G&S (Mikado) do. Donald Adams is, of course, a competent Deadeye, but he doesn't stand out as much as I'd expect of him. The only truly superior performance on this CD is Thomas Allen's Captain Corcoron.This recording does have two things going for it: they got it onto one disc, and it's usually priced lower than most other recordings. If you're looking for a Pinafore recording, this is a fine one. But if you think you want to add some more variety to your Pinafore collection (this was my sixth Pinafore), I'd recommend the Sadler Wells version over this one."
1,same old same old,I came to this book as a reference off of another book. Very disappointing. Nothing new. Don't waste your time
5,keep it stock,"i love this, i have the OE stereo cassette with the mp3 wire coming out of ashtray. keep the old school look without making it look ghetto, with an aftermarket. i had this for over a year, still works great."
3,Surprisingly Entertaining. 3 1/2 stars.,"I was surprised by the subdued manner in which Ms. Jolie played the lead character in this somewhat disturbing film about a stolen child, and a replacement masquerading as the original. Mr. Malkovich too was subdued in his supporting role as the crusading minister who comes to Ms. Jolie's aid when she has difficulty with the authorities. And although I felt somewhat uneasy with how the lead characters interacted (Mr. Malkovich's acting style has that effect on me), interest in the story kept my attention, as did the excellent support provided by Amy Ryan who befriends Ms. Jolie while at the hospital. Not his best, but another Eastwood winner."
3,Interesting peek at the history of LA cops,"While I found the story fascinating as both history and the story of a mother's anguish, I found Angelina Jolie's performance an amazing hash of good acting, over the top emoting, and strangely enough flat spots. The story held my interest for most of the two hours."
5,Gut-Wrenching Beauty,All I can say is this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!
3,"A GOOD STORY, BUT TOO LONG WITH FORGETTABLE PERFORMANCES! 3 1/2 STARS!","'Changling' is another good film directed by Clint Eastwood, but it could have used a little editing. The story starts off a little slow and confusing, but gains momentum after the first third of the film. Despite having solid performances, there are none I will remember tomorrow. The film also suffers from having one ending after another in the last half an hour! It's a beautiful looking film that's a little frustrating at times, but is certainly worth seeing. This is not Clint's best work, but is impressive at times."
4,Excellent movie,"Angelina Jolie is excellent in the role of a telephone supervisor, whose young son is abducted while she is at work. Ultimately she is informed that her son has been found alive, but when she goes to the railroad station to greet her returning son, she claims that the boy is not her son. She is criticized and reprimanded by a corrupt police lieutenant, who decides to commit her to an insane asylum. Meanwhile a pastor has been helping her discover the truth, which finally shows her son actually died heroically trying to save another boy from a madman who was brutally murdering young boys. There are two trial scenes; one where the murderer is brought to justice and one where the police lieutenant is demoted and the equally corrupt police chief loses his job as well. Based on a true story, this film is well done, and I recommend it as a must-see motion picture."
3,Changling Hangups,The movie content was based on real life. Excellent theme and presentation. The disc itself had several hangups in coding and it would freeze about five times at major scene changes. I would have rated it five star if the disc had functioned properly.
5,Changeling DVD,"I saw this movie on NetFlix and just to have it. This is one the most incredible true stories I have ever seen and it happened in New York. To everyone who has never seen this movie - WATCH IT! For mothers with young children, it is a must see movie. This movie receives my highest rating. Another great Clint Eastwood movie."
5,'Changeling',"This is the type of movie that you come away from the cinema and can't stop thinking about. It's a great DVD to add to the collection and still raises those questions when watching it in the comfort of your home. Highly recommended, the performances are outstanding!"
5,Fabulous Film,"I read a review awhile back that said you'd only like this film if you were into the 1920's. I almost missed this great jem. Well done in every aspect. This movie will come back to mind for many years to come. It is a shocking eye opener. I wouldn't discourage parents from watching it, as knowledge is power. It is a true horror story. Heart-breaking. How could it be possible? It makes you wonder how much of this serial killing stuff goes on. Be aware."
1,No Audio Output Form Blu-ray Version,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."
1,Way Over the Top,"I walked out of this film in the theatre. I just couldn't watch Jolie put her hand over her mouth and cry one more time. I hear that Clint Eastwood is retiring from the movies. Thank God. His bleak vision of the world has bored me since ""The Unforgiven"" right through ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby."" Enough is enough!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This is a very boring and pointless movie. Don't waste your time. To see Eastwood's best movie, rent ""Flags of Our Fathers."" (I almost walked out of Changeling.)"
2,Saint Angelina Is Boring in Melodrama,"Angelina's acting is terrible in this film. The role is poorly written to begin with (victimized, saintly mom) but her acting is flat and dead, as if all her real-life kids have drained her energy away. She is dull, listless and her face looks like a wax mannequin's (even before the kid disappeared!) Now that she's famous as a mother, adopting kids from everywhere, Hollywood can't resist trading on her image as Super Mom. Please! Bring back the old Angelina, the wild rebel, the bad girl. Did motherhood ruin her? The story held my interest only because of the real facts of the case are painful to hear. John Malkovich is also totally wasted in this film. Two formerly edgy and risk-taking actors are reduced her to mouthing cliches and indulging in self-righteous poses. What a waste of talent."
5,Dark and wonderful,"This is a truly haunting film, shot by the wonderful Clint Eastwood, who is maintaining his winning streak that seemed to begin with Mystic River. The film takes place in 1928 and chronicles the disappearance of a young boy and how the L.A.P.D. grossly mishandle the case. The events are based on a true story, which make the narrative all the more poignant.Angelina Jolie, not usually one of my favorites, is stellar as the distraught mother, who is put through absolute hell as she tries to find her missing boy.The film really seems to capture the starkness of pre-Depression Los Angeles. It's a bit corrupt, a bit seedy, and seems a world away from actual civilization.After viewing the film, Wikipedia ""Wineville Chicken Coop"" and read about the actual case; it'll make the hairs on the back of your head stand on end."
4,Jolie does a great job,"Eastwood draws a restrained performance from his star and she shines. Her eyes are the single most expressive element of her face, which here, sometimes appears less than attractive. The story is heartbreaking and is a great movie."
4,Pleasantly Surprised....,This was better than I expected. I'm not sure why....could be because it is an Eastwood film. He is better behind the camera than he is in front of it. John Malkovich is good as well.
3,Angelina Jolie in the Roaring '20s!!!,"For starters, I loved the look and feel of the classic '20's! I felt that some parts kinda dragged on for a while, like dumb ol' JJ Jones keeps telling Christine Collins that the boy is her son, even though it isn't. It's a good thing I didn't live back then, because the police would NOT have been a big help. I'm glad I saw it, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. If you like sexy Angelina Jolie, the classic '20s, and mysteries, you might like CHANGELING!!!"
2,Apalling script for an awesome story,"The trailer is very compelling but alas, also the only success in this Clint Eastwood production! The true incident from 1928 is dramatic and inspiring and should have made an excellent script.The characters are appallingly weak almost as though the period costumes and set were a distraction! Angelina is hugely disappointing as one may expect but John Malkovich? Clearly the director has failed. The screenplay is a whole disappointment unto itself and not just because its predictable in a school play sort of way. If the Academy had to award bad performances, this movie would sweep a dozen. This movie also features the worst portrayal of a police captain in the history of film (again, clearly the director's failure.) The narration of the gruesome slaughter of mere children is so terrible, its actually not disturbing!Worst of all, it runs about 2.5 hours. What a waste!"
2,"Part Good, part ugly, Jolie bad","Jolie seemed to sleepwalk through her part, a real downer that almost ruined the movie about a relentless mother in a desperate and heart-wrenching search for her missing son. Perhaps she was miscast or just can't act. The story was decent if slow in parts and without much conflict or surprise. Dark and foreboding light had been falling asleep at times. Good try, Clint, but this one didn't quite work."
4,The Changeling,This movie was exceptional--it held my attention till the very endGet your hankies out ladies --it is a tear jerker in parts!
4,Very good,I really liked this movie. I thought it was well acted and did a good job at depicting the era. Some scenes were hard to swallow i.e. the child abuse and the fact that the police department could ever be responsible for such a terrible thing to happen. I just couldn't believe this was based on a true story because it was just so angering what happened to that mother. It was written and directed very nicely and I thought it was a great movie.
3,Changeling,I didn't really enjoy this movie too much. It does show how women were treated not so long ago. Don't really know what to say. I watched it so long ago.
1,Jolie is overrated; scenes of graphic child-abuse horrifying,"I saw this movie with high expectations, having seen Angelina Jolie in other memorable roles. She under-acts throughout ""Changeling,"" and is unconvincing in this true story. She plays a 1920s woman in Los Angeles, Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son goes missing. Now, I would expect her to be out of her mind with fear, but instead, Jolie whimpers and gets teary-eyed, as if she just suffered a minor scrape. I don't understand director Clint Eastwood's motivation for the graphic depiction of the torture and murder of nine-year-old boys by a sadistic serial killer. Those scenes were horrifying and excessive."
2,Not again,"So this movie was very well written, and seemed to have a really good story behind it. So you ask how do I manage only two stars? Acting my friends or lack there of. This movie is attempting to tell an emotional story that is trying to draw you in. It's like doing The Godfather with Big Bird as Don Corleone. You just can not but into it. I tried to enjoy this because of the story, and the well written movie, but I could not get past the acting. Its just bad, scenes where you are supposed to be drawn to tears, end up have you laughing, or scenes where you are supposed to be enraged, once again laughing, and not as so often put ""funny ha ha"" but instead ""funny oh no"". I highly reccomend that if you feel you must see this movie for the story, rent it, or get it on demand, but do not buy this, you will be sorry if you do."
4,changeling angelina,"If you have ever had any doubts as to Angelina's acting chops, and I will admit to falling into that category, then this movie should change your mind. It certainly changed mine.Based on a true story, and all the more disturbing because of that, Jolie plays a single mother during the Depression whose only child goes missing. What follows is a harrowing tale with enough twists and turns to keep your interest all the way to the final credits, albeit without any of the usual explosions, gunfire, and other special effects that you would expect from a Jolie movie. There are a couple of characters that you will thoroughly enjoy loathing, and if by the end of the movie you don't find your heart going out in support of the star's character you should check yourself in for a transplant."
4,Most difficult film I've seen in a while.,"I haven't cried this much watching a movie in a long time. Maybe it's the mother part of me that just couldn't handle it, especially when what happened at the chicken coop begins to be revealed. Everything from then on was just heartwrenching. I almost didn't want to finish the movie, but I had to find out if she ever found her son. :(Amazing movie--I'm shocked that it was based on a true story--but I sort of wish I hadn't put myself through this--it felt a bit like having my heart ripped out and stomped on. I had to go give my kids extra hugs and kisses when I finished watching it."
3,not inspiring,"the author of this book intends to teach indian cooking by having the cook prepare 21 days of indian menus. there does not seem to me to be a progression from simple to complicated, or from one end of india to the other, but i may have missed something, since i have not taken up the suggestion and have merely used this book as a source for recipes.the recipes are arranged in a way i find annoying, and not just because of the american, british and metric measurements. this, of course, is a personal matter and others may find the recipes easy to use.this is a disappointing book. i kept it in my collection for the sake of one or two recipes i did not have duplicated in my other (too numerous to admit to) indian cookbooks.this would not be a book i would recommend to any level indian cook. there are many others in print that are more informative, have what i consider superior recipes, and are easier to use."
4,LOVE 101,The book is great an unique look at how we avoid be caring to ourselves more than we do others. The condition was marked up more than I thought was described. Timely shipping thank you.
1,Great Disappointment,"I have recently purchased the tape series of Love 101 much to my disappointment. If you are looking for a little reinforcement and a different perspective on how to accomplish self-esteem, these are not the tapes for you. However, if you enjoy listening to introductions to clips of nostalgic music and comedy routines then you might want to give this a try. I found that the subject matter had little to do with self-esteem directly but more to do with announcing the next ""ditty"" ranging from Mae West to Al Jolson and Groucho Marx. I doubt if most of these routines and songs have seen the light of day since the big band era. These tapes were more of a trip down memory lane than a ""boost"" in one's self-esteem."
4,"dark, disturbing, and deeee-lightful!","Bowie was getting pretty paranoid by this point, and Diamond Dogs shows it. This album is one of his darkest and most forboding.Nevertheless, there are still grooves to dance to, such as the funky 1984 and, of course, the Chant of the Ever-Circling Skeletal Family (it's a short dance)."
4,Diamond Dogs,"This CD holds sentimental memories of a slice in time of carefree teenage dreams threatened by an ominous and foreboding future.""We Are the Dead"" becomes the expression of the culmination of these thoughts and anxious feelings perfectly executed by Bowie haunting lyrics."
4,A Blast,"This brings me right back...I loved this in high school. Still do on re-listen. If you like this album, get the 30th anniversary edition (5 stars) ...the second disc is full of fun goodies. Some of my favorite Bowie."
5,"If you're going to buy one Bowie studio album, this is it!!!","This album carried me through university! This is David at his best, even better than Aladdin Sane. One of the best of all time. The only problem is this idea of adding bonus tracks to these remastered Bowie originals. Keep the track listings as they were. Release an album of outtakes but don't add them to the originals."
2,Give me a break,"It seems pointless to even read most of the other reviews of this album. Written by slobbering Bowie fans, the five star rating given to Diamond Dogs loses credibility. This album is MEDIOCRE. The last album in the line of Bowie's glam excursion leaves me feeling disappointed. The few tracks that I do like (Diamond Dogs, 1984) just don't stack up to his previous works, which I could listen to all the way through. Don't buy this album. Instead, get The Man Who Sold the World or Ziggy Stardust."
4,great bowie album,"i love concept records and this is probably my most favorite besides kate bush's ""the dreaming"". i love how ""sweet thing"", ""candidate"" and ""sweet thing (reprise)"" flow together, as well as ""big brother"" and ""chant of the ever circling skeletal family"". i think ""we are the dead"" and ""rebel rebel"" are my two least favorite songs on the disk. i so love the opener of the album as well--especially when he yells: ""this ain't rock 'n roll! this is genocide!"" and then goes into ""diamond dogs"". so dramatic! get this cd! it WILL stay in your cd player!"
4,Bowie's Bizarre Concept Album,"Just in time to usher out the end of 'glam rock', Bowie produced this dreary, but wonderful concept album. It opens with ""Future Legend"", a scary, hip opening that also started his concerts. This CD contains classics like ""Rebel Rebel"", ""1984"" and ""Diamond Dogs"" and they live on like the gems they were meant to be. ""The Chant..."" is a hypnotizing 'beat-down' delight ending with a word; ""rot""??? ""Sweet Thing"" is campy gay and not his best and ""We Are The Dead"" is exactly like the title suggests. ""Dodo"" and the demo of ""Candidate"" really don't add much to the album, but it's nice of RYKO to give them to us. The recording quality of the songs is mediocre - almost a tinny 'live' sound. If you can get past that and just listen to the ""mood"" that Bowie induces, you'll enjoy it."
5,Who is this Guy?,This was a replacement cd for my wife. It was one of a very few she brought into our marriage. I've never regretted hearing it. I just have one question...Will the real David Bowie please stand up!!
3,Diamond Dogs,"This album Suffers because Bowie did'nt know where to go.There were some traces of Ziggy Stardust,but then some of future recordings.But through all This The Album really is,nt that bad.Shure,not his best.but worth a listen."
2,Inconsistent and disappointing,"Some of the songs are quite good, but some of them are weak and/or performed without much punch. Up to this point in Bowie's career, it had sounded like he was trying as hard as he could to deliver high quality, but this album sounds to me like he was putting out a rushed or half-hearted effort. The title song for example could have been an excellent Rolling Stones imitation, but deteriorates into messy excess and gets off track. This album just isn't all that good! It's not enjoyable to listen to all the way through, and that is not because it is challenging or avant garde in some way."
3,"oh, behave!","this is bowie's glamiest, hamiest record. it's silly, but it rocks. it's dumb, but also kinda scary. i like it, but not too much...."
5,The Best of Bowie,"Ziggy Stardust, Diamond Dogs and Aladdin Sane are probably the best, and at least my favorite Bowie albums, Diamond Dogs shining the brightest. Originally intended as a rock opera based on the novel '1984', Diamond Dogs is the leftovers of those sessions after the rights couldn't be purchased. You simply have to listen to this front to back, for at least the first time. Personally, I never listen to just one tune, I just put it on and let it play. 'Diamond Dogs', 'Rebel Rebel', '1984', 'Big Brother' and 'Sweet Thing' are favorites, but I should really just list Diamond Dogs as my favorite album, as every song is enjoyable. Diamond Dogs was released during David's most experimental and outrageously lavish period in his career, and it's a solid effort. This one should be right between Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane in your CD rack."
5,One for the stars,"Mary Lou Williams is a pianist from the galaxy of pianists who came from the Greater Pittsburgh area - Earl Hines, Erroll Garner, Billy Strayhorn, Johnny Costa, etc... she had a pile driving left hand at the piano and a wide-ranging imagination when it came to writing music. This album is another fine exmple of her thinking. I don't think she ever received the fame she deserved...as a musician or as a composer."
5,Sincha Does It Again!,This is a most extraordinary video...Simcha Jacobovici is an amazing archaeologist with respect for all cultures. I learned so much from this amazing documentary!
5,Very accurate and well done,"Simka always is very objective and accurate and I think I have watched or read all that he has done, but still await the one on Mary Magdalen and Jesus."
1,not good,when it gives discription the discription is nothing like the movie.the discription makes you think theyll be exploring ancient things and useing scientific research to try and find the tribe. they do no such things.pretty much they just show people who say there a part of the lost tribe. not good
1,DVD is Defective!,"The DVD will not play. It was not ""programmed"" properly and will not play on any of the two DVD players I own or my computer. Another warning, even though this program was produced by A&E and the CBC, it was released to DVD by ""Jewish Quest Ministries"" This organization is a""jews for jesus"" type group. Since most Jews find prostelizing offensive be advised that buying this DVD will financially support these people."
2,Surprised by the Hype,"We read this book in my bookclub I had some serious issues with it. First the book needs major editing, the typos and some of the verbage used really detracted from my enjoyment of the book leading me to put it down on several occasions in total frustration. Also too much happens in the last few chapters - all the action is packed at the end. Yes it was action packed and intriguing but in general it needed alot more work before going public."
5,mystery and adventure!,Duplicity is absolutely gripping. Lee balances breakneck action and exotic mystery with careful storytelling that makes each character's psyche a fascinating tale in itself. Toni Lee is a talented writer--I'm waiting for the sequel!
1,You have got to be kidding me,"Seriously. The average review for this is four and a half stars? This CD is not what I would call quality music for my daughter. The girls can't sing. Most girls are able to sing off-key renditions of their favorite songs on their own. Another problem is the girls themselves. I would not call shoving someone into a pre-packaged cliche encouraging independence. And why is there not a Smart Girl among the bunch? Or even a black girl? All in all, if it was between Girl Authority or The Spice Girls, well, at least the Spice Girls sang original songs."
3,OK!?,"i think girl authority is ok...some of them have amazing voices, but others, not so much...i tried out for girl authority not so long ago and im friends with a few girls in the group, so im not going to doubt them, i just think some might need some more helpxoxoKathleen<3[...]"
2,Couldn't they find some girls with Talent???,I bought this CD for my daughter and I'm sure that she will love it since she is 5 and doesn't know any better. But the Songs are Horrible...Most of the girls really are not that great at singing. It is a little dissappointing because I am sure that they could have found some with more Talent. The Kidz Bop singers are much more talented and that is more of what I was expecting out of this CD. I would not waste your money on this.
3,can you say marketing?,"i know these girls - they can sing, but the marketing of their ""personalities"" is ridiculous. let them shine as they are. they don't need an adult to tell them how to appeal to other tweens. let them be themselves. the cd is good, but it's got that manufactured sound."
4,UP AND COMING WRITER,"THIS YOUNG MAN HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF CREATING A FANTASY WORLD THAT YOUNG READERS WILL ENJOY. WHILE THE WRITNG IS SIMPLIER AND THE PLOT NOT SO THICK AS A HARRY POTTER BOOK, IT IS AN ENJOYABLE READ FOR ANY AGE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW HE DEVELOPES AS A WRITER IN THE COMING YEARS."
4,Eragon,"It's a good solid story, but it is kind of is predictable and generic. I did enjoy reading it though!"
4,Nice but larger than expected,These earrings are really nice. I just think they are meant for someone a little older since they are large.I think they'd be perfect for someone over 40.
5,CCCP,"Great shirt. Worn and washed many, many times over the last 6 months and it hasn't shrunk and the 'CCCP' hasn't faded. Highly recommended."
5,Past Times,"This has to be the best work that moby has ever done.I remember in my band a few years back, moby was the one musician that got our lazy buts up and recording.Ive been trying for 4 years to find this album (name) and I have finally found it.This will deffinetly be listen to repeditevly for years to come.Everyone in america should have this album, because it brings on a type of spirituality that not many other bands can give."
2,Exiting the ordinary,2 1/2Moby begins to struggle out of generic techno land on this dull-with-a-side-of-intrigue EP. If it does anything important it is to highlight the budding artist's hint of creative liberation which was to be followed by full blown breakthrough.
1,Unbelievably Dull Performances,"I heard the Tannhauser Overture from this recording on the radio today. This was arguably the most dull and boaring performance of this masterpiece I've ever heard. And I've heard this piece of music countless times. The only reason I listened to it to completion was to find out who had done such an extraordinary job in destroying it. If there's one thing Wagner fans will all agree on it's that his music needs to sound spectacular. Certainly that's what Wagner expected. And with terrific performances by Solti ( Chicago symphony) and Barenboim (Chicago Symphony and Berlin Phil)and Tennstedt ( Berlin Phil) living up to Wagner's standard, it is easy by comparison to hear what a disaster this Lopez-Cobos performance is. It is certainly not the fault of the excellent Cincinnati Orchestra. This dud can be laid solidly at the feet of the conductor.For Wagner as it should be heard, get any of the recordings I mention above."
1,EAR-SPLITTINGLY LOUD,This vacuum doesn't do anything other cheaper ones can do and it is SO LOUD that I regret buying the thing.
1,Get a Broom,"I ordered an Oreck on line while sitting at home with a broken ankle. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. There is amost no suction. It picks up nothing but dust. Particles and pieces of paper are left on the floor. It needs to be forced across the floor. By the time you finish one area, you have had a work out. What I needed to know before buying this product was that I would have been better off with a good broom. Not only is it not worth what I paid for it, its not worth the shipping cost. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO CLEAN YOUR FLOOR. IT'S NOT WORTH ONE STAR.SORRY AS HECK,DOROTHY E. MONTGOMERY"
4,Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2002,"It was pretty good, it led to great insight on behind the scenes of an si photo shoot. It also helps that they are all really beautiful"
4,Living a Ragtime Life,"Every other Max Morath recording I've listened to is simply wonderful, and this one was very disappointing. Some of the same songs that were wonderful to listen to before are now done completely differently and aren't nearly as good."
3,"Great piano, Less Wonderful Singing","Max Morath here shows great chops in his piano playing on some of the fine ragtime compositions by Scott Joplin (Maple Leaf Rag and The Easy Winners), James Scott (Grace and Beauty), Joseph Lamb (Cottontail Rag), and Zez Confrey (Kitten on the Keys). His vocals, however, interrupt the flow in a way that probably is effective in a stage performance but not in the context of the surrounding rag piano pieces, and his voice is not all that great. The humorous vocals might have worked better on a totally separate recording: some are actually good, like ""If You Don't Have Any Money"" (don't bother coming around) and ""He Goes to Church on Sunday"" (but is a hell-raiser the rest of the time, loosely translated). His vocal working of Hughie Cannon's ""Bill Bailey"" and Irving Berlin's ""I Love a Piano"" just don't work well away from a stage and a live audience."
4,Nice for booting another OS on laptop,"I bought two of these , one to load up a linux OS on my laptop. It worked fine and booted up the linux OS easily. I didn't want to put the linux on my laptop hard drive in case it screwed up Windows and it boots into XP without the USB drive attached. It also works fine as a regular external hard drive to backup pix or other files."
2,60gb passport usb,"the hard drive is good, but shipping item losted, amazon resend it but late for business trip, very disappointed"
5,Rory is King,"Of all the Rory albums, of which you will not find a bad one, Photo Finish is probably the best one from start to finish. Songs like Shinkicker, Overnight Bag, and Fuel to the Fire are classics. He is a true genius of guitar and song writing. Rory is one of the few, if not the only, artists that I know of that I cannot point to bad record or a period that wasn't very good. You will not be disappointed with this album."
5,A great one,I don't know why this one wasn't released on CD in the USA til very recently but its one of his best studio albums.Well worth the price of admission.
5,An underrated gem!,"One of the unsung discs of the late Rory Gallagher's canon. The energy and intensity bristle and leap from the speakers. Rory had stripped the band down and recorded as a trio, which only benefitted the songs and performance. ""The Mississippi Sheiks"" contains transcendant slide guitar and references to great blues artists like Peg Leg Howell and Bo Carter. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR ...BUY THIS! We miss you , Rory!"
5,Caught by surprise,"I picked up this book randomly at the library for my 4 year old. The title is catchy and the first pages looked interesting enough. I was expecting cute and a tad sappy which is usually par for the course at his level. However, when I started reading it out loud to him, I was totally unprepared for how it touched me. This beautifully written and illustrated book has so much to offer. The message is expertly given and was easily understood by my 4 year old, while at the same time reminding me of things I knew but needed reminding of. Five stars are not enough. I am going to purchase a copy for keeps."
5,The Wonderful Life of a Fly Who Couldn't Fly,"Fantastic Book! I read it to my 6 year old and she said that it made her think that ""Happiness Can Be Your Wings""."
4,great watch,"A very handsome watch, and a bargain. Only problem is that it is hard to read the date--not enough contrast and too small."
4,hospital gown,they are long and tie and stay on my Mom very well...I do wish they and a few more choices in patterns that look more feminine..Roses or flowers of some kind would be nice to look at for a lady...then they would not looks so generic but they do fill the bill for length and warmth.
3,Decent doll,"I bought this doll for my 2 yr old. As stated previously, she does not sit or stand. You just have to lay her down.Her face is pretty, I don't think she's scary looking at all.Her hair gets messed up easily, so I put it in a pony tail.The dora ""dress up outfits"" DO FIT THE DOLL! That was an added bonus for us.Dora also comes with painted on underwear and an undershirt, which I like. I think it's supposed to be a bathing suit, although the doll cannot get wet."
2,"Heavy, Noisy not worth the $","This doll is very heavy. The body might hurt a small child if it were to fall onto their foot or something like that. The motions of the eyes and face are rather loud and almost overpower her voice. My daughter liked this doll, but I just don't feel it is very practical or a lasting value."
2,"Durable doll, but scary for adults who notice how creepy it is.",My daughter recieved this doll for a christmas gift. She seemed to like it but I couldn't stand being in the same room as it. Its eyes and especially its smile were really creepy. I was afraid it would start a murderous rampage when we weren't looking. My daughter loves Dora so I thought this would be a good toy for her but I was wrong. Shortly after Christmas this toy was donated to charity. She has another Dora doll with a fixed face that doesn't talk and its much less unsettling.
1,thought this would be the best for dora lovers- wrong!!!,"Luckily I found this at Christmas time for a low price so i didn't waste too much money. Within a few days the paint for the lips and teeth came off the face. Because the nature of short hair it now sticks up everywhere like bed head. (Not the biggest concern to me, she is a doll.)After a few months of forgetting the doll's existance she became intereting agian only to be dissapointed. The toy did not work even after changing the batteries. If the paint didn't come off so easily or the hair get matted the doll would look unused. This is not a durable toy at all. It broke with in six months or less with little playtime."
3,It's ok.,"My daughter begged for one of these for Christmas. I told her Santa said ""It doesn't really grant wishes."" She insisted and then got mad at the doll for not granting wishes. It was funny but kinda sad too. The doll is not attractive and is kind of ""Chucky"" like but it does stand up to quite bit of abuse."
5,Bridging The Family Gap,"I became interested in seeing this video on A & E, after seeing a biography of PT on the History Channel. Beau Bridges portrayed the adult PT Barnum in the movie, which also was an attraction for me. The film itself, starts out with the young PT, teenaged working in a small store. His entrepreneurship was evident even then, and the character was an engaging one. As I became attached to him, and his experiences, I began to see how closely his movements and actions resembled Beau Bridges, and thought to myself ""this'll be a wonderful transition to adulthood"". Of course, as you might have guessed by now, it was indeed another Bridges, I'm guessing the son of Beau. Beyond the acting, learning the story of the builder of Madison Square Garden, The Greatest Show on Earth, and innumerable other oddities and phrases, made this a most engaging film. I'm not sure of its historical accuracy, but it is good entertainment, and division of my country's(USA) earlier, simpler days."
4,Great Soundtrack for a So So Film,"This Movie made a real impression on me as a youth. However all I could ever remember were the songs and dance numbers. As i got older, I found out that there was a very good reason for this. The Movie was just OK,but the song and dance numbers were amazing. This score for the film has not been available on CD for quite some time, but the new mastering and packaging are really terrific. Highlight are ""Hey Big Spender"" and ""TheRhythm of Life"". Very very late 60'ies. Worth every cent."
3,Sweet Charity,"The music is great especially if you have seen the DVD however even if not, Shirley MacLaine would have to have the ""happiest"" sound to her voice and you can't help but smile as you listen to her singing If They Could See Me Now."
4,Sweet Charity: Sweet Memories,"Listening to this Soundtrack brought back so many sweet memories of a fun time in my life - college. Hearing ""Rhythm of Life"" done by Sammy Davis Jr. was most memorable. This is such a fun soundtrack to play. I look forward to many years of enjoyment and recommend it to anyone who was in college in the late 60's."
4,So-so,"Though the book is quite in-depth about how to do this particular kind of of autism treatment, I found it to be lacking in practical application. If the book is aimed at a mom who has no other children and can focus on a complete elimination diet, then they will love this one. Somehow that worked for this lady and she was able to spend weeks working on JUST his food and diet, and I believe I remember saying that this was all when he was pre-school aged. Otherwise, I'd skip it and read something more educational and encouraging. Also, this mom does have some great tips about things you can chang ein your household to see if there are any improvements."
5,One of the Best Thriller Soundtracks,"I've been longing for this soundtrack ever since I watched the movie, which by the way is one of my all-time favorites. The CD is great, I concede you have to be in the mood to listen to it but if you have a nice stereo system and a room to enjoy a good book(preferably a murder mystery) then buy this soundtrack."
2,Very thrilling soundtrack,"The Fugitive is one of the best movies ever made. But not the soundtrack. Although the tracks are thrilling and really add to the movie, its not a nice track to listen to. The composer did a good job (He even received a Oscar nomination), but its only good for the film."
5,Why this is one of the best contemporary music CD's,"The Fratres of Pärt is a wonderful piece of minimal contemporary music. I like the Fratres series because it they have a serene but though penetrating harmony, It's just like instrumental choir music with an immense polyphony. Pärt throws with voices in this piece. It's also a prove of his faboulous tintinabully-composing style. Together with the other pieces, Pärt delivers us a freezing album which has an enormous impact on you in silent moments of your life. According to me the I Fiammingi version is one of the best available, so I don't know why you shouldn't buy it. Its heavenly gregorian alike voices together with the sharp contemporary dissonant harmony make a unique artwork of it."
4,Mesmerizing,"OK, the people who made this album are officially crazy. Nine tracks, and six of them are different arrangements of Fratres! But it's a good crazy. The piece is fascinating and very evocative and draws you in. So, believe it or not, it works.Once I had it playing while I was working on something else. Fifteen minutes after the CD ended I realized that there was no more music, although in some mysterious and enchanting way I continued to hear it in the air."
4,"Beautiful, Sombre","I don't know Part's work very well... and I found most of the recording to be sombre, and frequently beautiful.... But the piece ""Summa (for Strings)"" is regal, transcendant, other-worldly.... almost unimaginable beauty."
2,Compatability Issues,Doesn't work with 3rd generation iPods: menus locked-up and never did get sound out of it. The video quality is terrible when viewed on HDTV.
1,All The Negative Reviews Are On The Money - Beware!,"I've owned this unit for about 6 months. I had the previous version of the HomeDock and had bad luck with it also. Bought this hoping they had ironed out the bugs and now I just feel twice as stupid. Slow response time, menu buttons often don't work and now I can't get it to come on at all. I have a friend who owns one and his is junk as well. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of DLO for this type of product."
2,It worked fine until......,"I wanted this product to use in my motorhome, and initially I loved it. It showed my music on the tv, with a nice display. The remote worked fine too. Then, I lost the left channel. After several calls and emails, I find out they have no way of doing any repair. So it worked fine, once, then its a doorstop. Too bad, it could have been great, but I am afraid to buy another one with the poor support."
1,"""THE WORST OF ALL""",OK Here it is it's smiple read the specs and it say you can see the cover flow for I-Pod on TV screen NOT!!!! So if you do not want to see the clover flow or album covers like on your I-Pod they this was made for you!
2,Not Worth it,"Not worth the money. The video quality was poor, the remote did not work well, poor quality. Bought a Apple TV unit, much happier with it"
2,Did not like the remote control,"I thought the remote control was difficult to use, especially the volume control. But most of all I think a remote like this should connect via RF (radio frequency) rather than IR (Infra red). Other conroller are available in RF.I also found that the video display had very poor resolution on my HD TV"
3,A bit painful when using the remote...It won't work all time,"Cool item for Ipod lovers like myself, but still pricy I guess..The remote will not work all the time, you have to be patient and keep pressing the bottons till it changes the menu on the TV screen...."
4,it delivers,Everything I expected (for the most part)...My only request of the product would be to improve the on screen (TV) navigation as it is a bit oversimplified and doesn't provide the robust navigation of the iPod itself.
1,Garbage,"Don't buy this product ! Not only is the hardware quality poor, the on-screen menus reminiscent of 80's DOS applications, but it also fries iPods. Yes my perfectly functioning iPod worked for awhile with the Home Dock, and now - nothing !"
2,Somewhat Deceptive Marketing,"I bought this dock for the ""onscreen display"" capability as you navigate the iPod menus, to use it with my Ipod Video. Well, it took reading the fine print ""note"" in the manual to realize that onscreen navigation is only good for the ""music"" menus, NOT for photos or videos. When I read the box again I noticed the subtle wording difference: you can ""navigate"" and ""select"" the songs, but can only ""display"" and ""control"" the photos and the videos. In summary, when it comes to photos or videos, what you are getting is nothing more than you get with a $ 39.00 Apple iPod Universal Dock. Hmmm... I think this should have been clearly announced on the box, so that you can make an informed decision, whether you want to pay $ 110.00 extra just to see the song names on your TV screen. I returned mine."
2,Poor sound quality,"I would say the navigation in the audio mode is good and the remote is pretty sensitive. However, I was using Kensington's Stereo Dock before. The sound quality is so much better than this DLO HomeDock Deluxe. I am also disappointed that it does not include the S-VHS cable. In short, it is not worth it."
4,DLO Home Dock Delux,"Works as advertised. Sound quality has been good and the on-screen menu works fine. I have not had the problems with the remote that others reported. There are some quirks from time to time. It seems to work best when the power is turned on first and then dock your I Pod. It would be nice to be able to control videos or movies from the on-screen menu, but maybe they'll add that to a future version. Overall, 4 stars... there's always room for improvement."
5,Great product - works as advertized,"When I was shopping for this item, I read many reviews. Many were usefull but I found some made me think twice. I bought the unit anyway and I am totally satisfied with it. It works as expected, the sound is as good as any other component I have on my stereo. I used every feature and got what I expected. What I find very handy is the dual mode of operation: iPod only or iPod through my TV set. The only thing I can point out that I found slightly disapointing was the missing artwork when I use my iPod in TV mode. I went to the DLO web site, had a look around to see if there was an answer for this and basically discovered that the artwork display was deleted from the final build of the firmware that comes with this unit. DLO are promising an update sometime in the future.So, go ahead, buy this unit, try it out and return it if you don't like it. It works as advertized."
3,ok........ it works....,"Does exactly what is says ok. It's a pain in the [..] to dock the 80gb and get this dang thing to read it. It has to be put on it just right. The remote sucks and other programmable remotes work worse with it. Sound is awesome, having some control is good. I give it a 3 cause at least after some fuss getting started it works. although the remote sucks.Wish there was a better product available!!!"
1,WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"The main problem with this home docking system is that it only works when it wants to, which is not very often. Also the unit itself gets extremly hot even when it's not being used. Very cheaply made, I returned mine to Best Buy after only one week of use. What a disapointment."
1,Cant Get It To Work,"Just unwrapped mine today. Tried to watch one of the movies in my iPod. THERE IS NO SOUND OUTPUT. Ruled out the possibility of defective cables. Video works fine unless I try to use the S-Video output port, which is defective as well. Useless."
5,Excellent clock-redio PLUS,"I have been more than satisfied with this product. The ability to be serenaded to sleep with an iPod Playlist of my choosing, and wake up by the alarm systems (when necessary) to the news on radio has been happily very helpful. Great product!"
1,WAIT YOU ARE BUYING THE WRONG MODEL THERE IS A NEWER ONE!!!!,SEARCH FOR DLO HOMEDOCK DELUXE MODEL 009-9800. IT IS A NEWER MODEL THAT CAME OUT FEB 2007 AND IT HAS MUCH NEWER FEATURES AND A USB PORT TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE. THIS MODEL 009-9765 IS AN OLDER VERSION!!
5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, AAA",I highly recommend the product. It views great in my TV.. Can't scroll videos on my TV but that's Apple's fault. The music navigator though works great on my TV. Videos look excellent.
2,Caveat emptor.,"This product worked great for me... until it stopped working. I can't comment on how well the video works, as I only used this product to listen to my music connected to my stereo. In this regard, I liked the dock very much. Until a few weeks ago when the remote stopped working.So I purchased another remote, and that one didn't work either, which meant that the problem was with the dock itself. Mind you, it still works, just not with any remote.It was only used for a few months, and sparingly. It hasn't been damaged, moved, left to extreme heat or cold, and it hasn't been abused or misused in any fashion. And, of course, it stopped working after its paper-thin warranty had expired.I say, find something else to play your iPod. And make sure it's not DLO brand."
2,Ok,"This movie had some good laughs but you can tell it was a pretty low budget film. Some acting was good, others acting was pretty horrible."
1,Sloppiness and Lack of Insight Make for a Disappointing Read,"I picked up ""Scare Tactic"" after finishing William Castle's very engaging memoirs, ""Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America."" There is very little original material in John Law's book... most of it is just a rehash of Castle's memoirs, in which Law re-tells Castle's anecdotes, sometimes refuting them. (Mostly on minor details like dates.) Law offers a few terse observations and insights of the man's life, but not really until the very last 10 pages of the book. The most glaring and offensive thing about this book is how poorly it is edited: simple mistakes (like spelling ""Ursula"" ""Ursual"" or ""their"" instead of ""there"") dot almost every single page, making this book seem even more amateurish. I suggest picking up Castle's memoirs instead... they're much more entertaining and better written."
4,Zero Gravity Windscreen,Exactly what I needed. Fit to specifications and shipped on time. Great looking product! Looks awesome on my Ducati bikini fairing.
2,great book,I have not read this book yet. It was recomended to me on parkinson disease. I have other sources to use. I have heard great things of the book.
4,Commonsense approach to therapy for Parkinson's,"Ordered this book for myself, and one for a dear friend who is also a Parkinson's patient. My neurologist heartily recommends regular exercise to alleviate and slow the progression of the disease. I have found this book to be very helpful, and presented clearly with written and visual instructions."
4,Practical suggestions and techniques for patients and caregivers,"Together, John Argue's DVD and companion book provide and illustrate valuable suggestions for Parkinson patients and caregivers. ...A useful addition to any Parkinson's Disease library.I suspect that the DVD and book would provide some ""Aha!"" moments for anyone afflicted by other medical conditions with accompanying degenerative motor functionality."
4,parkinsons disease and the art of moving,An excellent book to help parkinsons patients with exercise. Well documented and easy to understand.
5,Easy Exercises for the Parkinsonian,"This book is a valuable tool for every P.D. patient. The doctors never tell us what specific exercises to do to prevent the progress of our disease. This books clearly illustrates with photographs how to do exercises for every need. The directions are clear and precise. What is most appealing is the underlying philosophy of graceful, mindful, and complete. Every exercise is a meditation of sorts that requires the patient to focus. Argue, the author, presents a program that offers hope of preventing progression of sysmptoms, but more importantly, he also offers hope for those already afflicted. It is possible to reverse or alleviate some symtoms to a degree. The book gives the patient some control and also offers an opportunity to fight back. Don't just read it. Do it."
4,"For True Femmes Fans,","If your expecting The Violent Femmes usual nervous guitar playing over Gordon Gano's voice you'll be in for a bit of a shock. The band by this time was dealing with many changes. A new record label and the loss of their old drummer (good riddance) so this album clearly shows off the imperfections of all these new things. The album doesn't show off the true talent or energy that we femmes fans know them for. It does, however, prove that Guy Hoffman is as good drummer (and even better) as Victor. My favorites songs were ""Breakin' Up"" which showed a more electric side of them and ""Machine"", a erie sound effect songs that has Gordon saying ""he has a machine and he'll take over the world over"" over and over again. Truely this CD is for diehard femmmes fans that welcome they're experimenting ways. (People like me:)"
2,"First song was great, but what happend then???","The Femmes kick this album off right, with ""Don't Start Me on the Liquor"". A catchy, up-tempo song with that same vintage Femmes sound that we all know and love from their self-titled debut. This track also showcases the remarkable bass playing abilities of Mr. Brian Ritchie. (Possibly one of the most under-rated bass players in rock music!) Unfortunately I was a bit let down after that song, because the album takes on a completely different direction. It's a new wave kind of vibe featuring synthesizers and some other obscure instruments. I wonder if the lead off track was an older song that they had never released, and then just decided to put it out then since they were doing another record. As a fan of the band I can respect that they were trying something new, but unfortunately it didn't work well on this record."
1,lt,"as you see i ordered a 20 inch rim for my kids bike..put it on and the tire was larger then the rim..thus the tire would not fit properly, got out an old 20 inch rim to compare the 2...the new rim was almost 1/4 inch smaller thus the bad fit of the tire..now i have a brand new rim that cant be used...dear manufacturerer,,if ya advertise something you sell, make sure it is what you say it is....."
2,disappointment,"much smaller tham i thought these would be. hardly can see the stones, i've never worn them, but too much of a hassle to send back! buyer beware!"
2,"Striaght boys, gay boys III","This movie was more ""soft porn"" than a love story. It lacked the element romance. I may not have enough attention to other reviews."
2,only ONE knee pad per package!,"Got the package today, opened...and found only 1 knee pad. I have 2 knees, so what good is one knee pad???"
5,Impressed and EXHAUSTED!,"This DVD is unlike any one that I have ever done! It is not your average gym workout nor the average sculpting-focused dvd.... this is CARDIO to the max! I did it for the first time yesterday, and I'll say I couldn't do everything but that is my goal - to do it all and to do it all with proper form!!! I can't wait!Happy Exercising!"
3,I HATE THIS WORKOUT!!! (but it's good).,"ok, so the reason i didnt give this video such an amazing rating is because I HATE DOING IT. i'm fairly in shape but this video is a$$-kicking. it's a good workout, i sweat like mad and i feel great after i finish, but it's a painful process and i find myself dreading the circuits. i'm half bored/half exhausted but i know it's really good for me... but i wish i could find a workout that i was happier doing. but it WORKS though and i'm feeling stronger and more toned.---------UPDATE: it's been 2 mos and i hate hate hate this. it's good, it works, but i hate it. i like J's other videos better......."
3,i work out everyday and found this very hard!,"I am not your average exerciser, I try to do something every day for at least an hour. I go to spin, hot yoga, run 3 miles, or bike at least once a day. I was shocked that this was so hard for me! I can't imagine recommending it for my mom or someone getting in to fitness. It's a good workout but be prepared and take it at your own level. Trust me: This isn't your mom's workout!"
5,Great cardio circuit,"Don't try to compare this and 30 Day Shred. Two different workouts: Banish Fat is mostly a cardio circuit with some strength mixed in. Great to add into a weekly routine as it is best to not always do steady cardio workouts. 30 Day Shred is 20 min, great for people on the go, and covers every major muscle head to toe. I recommend both. I like to use 30 Day Shred when I don't have time for a more extended strength training workout."
5,great trainer,"Jillian is a really great, really motivating trainer, even through the tv! This workout is hard, but she shows modifications for beginners. I really love doing this workout, and after only a week I am seeing results. I definitely recommend this!"
3,average,"This video is like an old-fashioned aerobic workout video. If that's what your looking for, great! (I wasn't) It's a lot of the typical moves -- but requires a lot of jumping, so if you live in an apartment like me... you might want to time this workout for when the downstairs neighbors won't be home. I much prefer her six-week six-pack vid. (and it gives you great abs!)"
5,Great workout!!,"This is one of my favorite videos, but it's definitely hard. I use it when I need to give myself a harder workout, but I also have to build up to it, especially when I haven't been on my A-game for a while. Would highly recommend it!"
4,Great workout,This is a great work-out following 30 day shred. It is broken up into 6 circuits so it's easy to incremently increase the length of the work-out.
1,Jillian Michaels video,I would have probably liked it but the DVD wouldn't play on my dvd player.I don't; know what the problem is.
1,Do not buy these videos,This would be a decent video if Ms. Michaels voice could be deleted!! It's incredibly grating and annoying. Plus she give horrible cues and is very condescending to her viewers! If you are going to spend the money go with The Firm's workouts or Kathy Smiths.
4,Good Cardio Workout,"I just got this video to supplement my other two Jillian videos (Banish Fat and 30 Day Shred w/ weights). I typically take classes at my local Y but being a busy working mom, I can't seem to get there lately. I would give this video about a 'medium' intensity level compared to the classes that I have taken at the Y. I love the middle part where she is doing burpees and mountain climbers (they are killer and I can't do the whole thing), but I think that it starts out a little slow. The end is good too where you do the floor exercises - my arms are pretty sore the next day. I would say that if you are used to hour long cardio/strength classes at your local gym, then you may find this video a little short on the length of intensity. I would just up the intensity by adding light weights during some of the circuts."
5,Great workout!,"I just got this DVD and love it! It's a real, athletic workout you can do anywhere, no equipment needed. I have been supplementing my exercise routine with various videos for over 15 years, mainly Denise Austin, so I was ready to try something more challenging. This is it! I have the 30 Day Shred in addition, which I also love, and I've been alternating that with this DVD about 5 days a week. I'm already feeling much stronger and have more endurance after just a couple of weeks! Most DVD's don't provide much of a cardio workout and I mainly do them for toning exercises, but this one kicks my cardiovacular system into high gear! It was challenging enough make me actually break a sweat (which doesn't happen much with DVD's) while still being do-able. I'm now a Jillian fan!"
5,Still burning!,I started the program yesterday and I have to tell you that I'm still feeling the effects. I would have to say that anyone who does this program will be in tip top shape in no time. Although I'm pretty sore I'm looking foward to day 2. Bring it Jillian!
4,Good deal,"It is a great product, it doesn't skip or anything. For a ""date"" with Jillian, this is a good deal. She's kicking my butt! I Love the workout!"
5,I'm pretty sure I sweat out my fat...,"...it's great; but I'm pretty sure her two back up dancers are robots... Creepy endless smiles... Ability to kick over their heads... robots for sure!The 30 Day Shred back up ladies are much more human and don't make me feel as... inexperienced. And that one shows the easy way first, instead of the hard way first; like this one. But it's quite a tough workout. Recommended for sure... if you can stand the robots..."
5,Hard Core Workout,"Challenging, use your own body weight (no equipment needed). You'll be sure to sweat and your heart will pump. I love Jillian Michaels"
5,GREAT DVD!!!,"I don't consider myself to be someone who is in shape, however, I found that I can do this dvd for 30 minutes and get an excellent workout. I definately have lost weight with this dvd and when I do use it I go 5 days a week.I don't understand why people who claim to be ""in shape"" say this dvd was too difficult, Jillian could show more modifications, but all in all, glad I purchased it and will definately continue to use it."
4,great exercises,I started this dvd after finishing the 30 day shred. I like the exercises a little bit of kick boxing. A little bit of this and that. Uggghhh I hate the burpees. Anyway if you are intermediate level I say get this. I prefer the girls from 30 day shred over the girls in this dvd personality wise. I started doing only 30 min. of this dvd and then when I was ready would add doing it for 40 min. since I was used to the 25min. from 30 day shred. I'm pretty sure this workout goes longer than what it says I've timed it and Jillian just keeps going with her exercises. One thing I noticed is she doesn't have you using any handweights for this dvd which I was used to from the 30 day shred. So I implemented them myself not wanting to lose any muscle. Overall I am happy with the dvd.
3,Boring workout,"I was dissapointed when I tried this workout and was bored of it in the first 30 minutes. I had to take out the DVD because my motivation was almost at zero. I think maybe it was just too slow and easy to keep me going and some of the moves were hurting my ankle, which I had surgery on about 7 months ago. I'm not a huge fan of Jillian, but for fitness' sake, I get over it. I'll try it again, but for now I am not pleased."
5,Great tough workout!,"I've had this DVD for a couple of years now and keep coming back to it. It's a great fast-paced cardio workout that really delivers the burn to my muscles and gets my heart rate up. I love that there's no equipment needed. Jillian is good about giving instruction with respect to form and explaining why she has structured the workout as she has. There's also decent pacing between the more intense moves and the active recovery moves. There's a lot of plyometrics, so if you have bad knees or are very overweight, you may have trouble with this one. Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD, No More Trouble Zones, and 6-Week Six-Pack!"
5,"very hard , very good","this dvd is NOT for beginers , it's extremely hard , but very effective . i am grdually working my way up with it , to do more of it each time . it works on your whole body . very vigorous . very comfurtable 'case you need no equipment . it's very jumpy so if you are not into this kind of excersize these is probably not for you . all the rest - go for it , it's great , just get ready for a hard ride . good luck !"
4,Jillian has done it again...,"I have tried Jillian's ""How to Win by Losing"" series, the ""30-day shred"", and now this workout video. It wasn't disappointing by any means, and the nice thing about this video is that you don't need weights to do it. You would think that after Jillian has made so many workout videos she would start repeating a lot of the exercises, but this workout still has a great variety of exercises (some new and old) and leaves you sweating and tired at the end of it. And, as always, Jillian encourages you through the end of it, leaving you feeling accomplished and empowered!"
5,Banish Fat Is right,I brought this DVD last year and I'm still using it until this day it does exactly as the tittle says banish fat I've lost a nice amount of body fat so far using this DVD& it has boost my metabolism before this I was a little lazy now I'm on it. Get it and work on banishing that fat & boosting your metabolism:)
3,BANISH FAT BOOST METABOLISM-JILLIAN MICHAELS VIDEO,THIS EXERCISE VIDEO DOES HELP YOU GET A GOOD CARDIO WORK OUT AND FLEX/STRENGTHEN MAJOR MUSCLES GROUPS. BECAUSE OF MY AGE (59YO) AND ARTHRITIC BACK PROBLEMS I AM NOT ABLE TO DO THE JUMPING AND POUCING TYPE EXERCISES. SO I MODIFY SOME OF THE EXERCISES TO COMPENSATE. ALL IN ALL I FIND IT TO BE CHALLENGING AND EFFECTIVE.
5,GREAT workout!,"I've been using the 30-Day Shred (as part of my larger overall workout routine) for a few months. I absolutely LOVE it and LOVE Jillian, so I was excited to hear about the new DVDs. I ordered this one, as well as 'No More Trouble Zones.' I should have them in a day or two. I found 'Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism' on Exercise TV last night and tried it. Wow! A GREAT workout! I love Jillian's 'Personal Trainer' style. I much prefer her style of workout over the more 'dancy' stuff that's out there."
5,kick butt workout,"when looking for a workout, i wanted someone who could challenge me to work hard and help me stay in shape. i really enjoy this video because it definitely is both! i like jillian michaels, also. she is a lot of fun, and the workouts are super hard. i wanted something different than what i was used to (kickboxing only and gym routine). this was the dvd i was looking for."
1,Too much jumping,"With this video, you jump around so much, I can't do it while my husband is sleeping - I wake him up! I can't even imagine doing this in an apartment building - you're neighbors would hate you! This video is also really bad for anyone who has any knee issues - you simply jump too much.Also - I am not a novice exerciser. I work out every morning before work for about 1 hour - jogging, yoga or exercise videos. I do the 30-day shred videos when I am short on time and I like those- but one hour of that die-hard intensity is too much for a regular workout several days a week. It is great if you want a video to really kick up the notch of your exercise occasionally - but on a regular basis I think it is just too much."
4,Great workout,"This video is great for a cardio workout that beats the boring gym routine. I wish it were a little more intense. After the third time I felt I could be pushed harder. I work out pretty regularly, though, so that may be why I need more intensity. Otherwise, I like the way the cardio routimes are broken down into sections and I like Jillian. She's really motivating."
5,AMAZING! Jillian does it Again,"OK, About 10 years ago I lost about 90 pounds and had kept it off. I quit smoking about a year and a half ago and alas I gained about 15 pounds.I am trying to lose those 15 and an additional 15 more. I am 5'4 and weigh 150.I have tried sooooo many different workouts! Which is how I have lost the weight. I have to tell you, out of all the workouts that I have done Jillian by far has been the best. I started doing the shred 4 days ago and today I did my first Banish Fat... I yelled at Jillian about 20 times, because the workout is so intense but totally doable. I will update my progress here and hopefully pick up some tips from you all.Get this DVD Now! nothing to lose but the weight ;-)"
4,Butt kicking,"I always knew Jillian Michaels could deliver results, but I can attest to it personally now. This tape is awesome, and a challenge beyound belief. She's tough, but I like her teaching style. It's motivational."
4,Good Work out,I enjoyed working out with the video. The first day I felt it.I am going to keep working out and get some results.
4,This workout is tough,I really like this workout. It's comparable to the No More Trouble Zones workout. The one thing I would caution anyone with sensitive knees to go easy during this workout. My sister is in good shape and halfway through she was remarking about her knees hurting.
2,Approach with caution,"This video has great exercises in it, however, there are several that can be hard on your knees and joints if you are not in great shape to begin with. Jillian does not show low-impact versions of these. Other than that, it's great."
3,Touch On Rough Knees,"I am a type of person that reads reviews and give honest ones.. These workout look pretty basic meaning easy to follow, no dumb dancing.. but once starting them I am convinced that the only good workouts for someone with bad knees are ellipticals and similar machines.. jumping, bouncing, squating with weights are no good for bad knees.."
5,Will make you sweat!,Jillian's workout is tough but manageable. I was hoping to find a workout tape that would be as tough or tougher than the Tae Bo Advanced: Get Ripped tapes. This is it. She sets up an intense workout but is able to balance the cardio and strength training. This workout will get you in shape. Not for beginners.
5,A good workout,"I definitely feel like I get a good workout everytime I do this video. I have quite a collection of workout dvd's and this is one of my favorites for the days I'm not doing weight training! I love that each of the circuits on this video use different moves, so you do not get bored. I workout 5-6 times a week (with different videos)and am in fairly good shape. I absolutely felt wiped-out when I did this the first time and I still can hardly get through the whole dvd. I really feel like it is a good way to get toned and burn calories."
5,Great workout...not for the faint of heart!,This workout provides a great combination of cardio training! I have done several other Jillian workouts and this one is no easier. She provides 40 minutes FULL of fat blasting moves!
5,good item for price,"Not to expensive, and a great workout. my sister in law loved it as a gift, and is lending it to me to try out."
5,HARD CORE!!!,"Another great work out by Jillian. I loved it, and it was well worth the price. She is by far my favorite trainer, and she hasnt let me down yet!"
3,Beyond tough...,"I feel that I am in decent shape. I workout everyday for 30 to 60 minutes. I have done Jillian's 30 Day Shred and loved it, so I figured I would feel the same about this DVD... WRONG. I hate it! And the reason I hate it is because, no matter how many times I try it, I can never get through it. By the third circuit, I feel like I'm dying and I physically cannot do anymore. I have tried it many, many times, and it never gets easier. While I like working hard, I don't like trying to do a DVD that I find physically impossible."
4,Hardcore Cardio Blast,"Man is this video tough. This is a great next step once you are able to complete all three levels of the 30 day shred. I am fit, healthy and an avid sports enthusiast and this video takes every ounce of strength I can muster. If you want to get into great shape with some serious cardio exertion, then this is the video for you. I've seen dramatic increases in my endurance, stamina and lung capacity thanks to this video."
4,Going to work you good!,"I really like this video, I purcased after using the 30day shred workout. I wish it was a combo of weights in this one. I love the abs and legs circuit. I also like how she gives each exercise about 30 seconds, so you don't get bored or burnt out super quick.Work Out Mom"
4,Solid as always,"JM never fails to disappoint. It's a good solid aerobic workout. I have most of her other videos and the moves are the same, but because the workout is longer than her typical 20 min circuits, it's harder. Each circuit is also working on a certain muscle group or a mix of 2. It's well rounded overall. I recommend."
4,Good cardio workout,"After a disappointing experience with No More Trouble Zones on Monday, I wasn't holding my breath for this one. I was relieved when I felt like I was getting a good workout with this DVD.Things I like about this DVD:1. Fairly easy to modify the moves.2. Music was tolerable to okay.3. Heart was pumping the entire time.Things I didn't like:1. Still rough on the knees, but I've done enough Jillian workouts to have figured out heart pumping substitutes or modifications.I still prefer 30DS, but I'll keep this DVD in rotation for days that I'm not running."
5,Makes me sweat and breath hard!,"This is an awesome video. I am intermediate to advanced in fitness and this made me work. Hardly does a video make me sweat like I am in the gym, but this one definitely did. And without weights and other props too! This is a great workout. I think even if you're a beginner, you should at least try it since she does give you options and you can work your way up. Highly highly recommended!"
4,"Yes U will sweat, and sweat and sweat","I read all the reviews here and on another name-less site. All were good, so I took the plunge and brought the DVD. Yes, some of her move mimic the Shred DVD but that is good because I didn't feel overwhelmed.I will just say this I sweated my behind off, and huffed and puffed. The moves are difficult especially the planks from elbow to str8 arm . My God this woman knows torture moves. LOL. I did finish all 7 circuits but skipped the cool down. I went for a brezzy walk I needed air quickly. lol Variety is the key to staying with any exercise plan/routine. I would like to see her use more men in her videos not since her 2005 Biggest Winner 2 dvd collection have I seen any men."
5,"Great workout, kicks my b*tt","This is a great workout and really makes me sweat. I am a pretty avid excersicer but doing this workout is still challenging for me and really feel good after finishing the whole thing. She has a good combination of lower body and upper body cardio workouts, all with no weights. She has 1 circuit that focuses on abs. Overall very challenging and I recommend it."
4,Quite a workout,"I think Ms. Michaels' workout regimen is a very good combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercises; it also very reassuringly seems to be grounded in exercise physiology, evidenced especially by the well put-together warm up and cool down sessions.She also means it when she says she doesn't let up. This workout is intensive, and leaves you breathing hard and sweating buckets. (Attractive, right?)I fully believe, however, it is capable of helping you lose the 5 pounds a week it promises.Overall, very well done. I think it was well worth the investment."
2,Could be better,"I love Jillian, and I am an avid follower of hers. I own the 30 Day Shred, and I am a member of her website. I must say, though, I was completely dissappointed by these two new DVDs. This one in particular. I did not feel like this was much of a workout comapared to what she usually does. I feel like the segments were too slow to really make a difference. After I did this video, I went for a run just to finish my workout, however, after the 30 Day Shred Video, I am dead! I think that if you want a longer workout, it would be more beneficial to do two circuits of the 30 day shred rather than this video. I was not impressed."
3,Feels to long,If you like Jillians videos then you'll like this one its was just a bit long for me and I couldn't keep doing it as I bore easily with certain videos but it was a good workout
3,A good work out,"This is a good beginners work out. If you're just starting out, and want to get into the swing of regular exercise, this video is perfect. It doesn't require any weights or mats or extra equipment like the others, I would recommend her 30 Day Shred video though to those who want a little challenge. the 30DS video however requires some hand weights."
3,Ummm hello?,"This video is really good... in the sense that it DOES make you sweat, and it IS a good workout. The only thing I don't like about this video is that Jillian Micheals doesn't even do half of it. And throughout the workout, she doesn't encourage you, she just talks to her ""girls"" and stops in the middle to talk about things that don't really help...it's sorta like she's tired and she just decided to stop for a while so she could catch her breath and talk about nothing. Plus she is very un consistent. She'll do 10 reps on one leg and 16 on the other....but that's my opnion. Other then that, it's not as hard as everyone says it is...and I suppose it is a good workout if your looking for change."
4,"Very good, well rounded workout","Good, efficient workout that includes arms, legs and core...and gets the heart really pumping!! The music is pretty bad, as others have reported. Do it a few times with the sound, so you can get the instruction. Then, mute the tv and use your ipod - much better! The workout is good enough, however, that i would recommend it even with the bad music. If you are a beginner, the moves can be modified until you build more endurance and strength. This one will make you sweat!!"
4,Not my fav but still great!,Great workout with no weights. It's not my favorite Jillian Michaels dvd but still a good one to say the least. I swear this dvd drags on forever! You'll definitely feel the burn! I highly recommend all of her dvd's I've lost 20 pounds from doing her dvd's and watching what i eat.
5,excellent workout,Love this workout. Hard to find a workout that is challenging for me on DVD but this one does it! I sweat like craz and love it!
5,Great workout,"This is a great workout DVD. Jillian keeps you motivated and you definitely will sweat! My main form of exercise had been walking/running on the treadmill, and I never felt like I was working hard enough. By the end of this workout, I am sweating like crazy and know that I have worked hard."
5,Great Workout!,"Jillian is awesome! This workout is incredible. I bought it based on all of the great reviews here on Amazon, and the video did not disappoint. Jillian keeps things interesting and fun while keeping me motivated. I highly recommend this workout!"
5,Good workout,"I own 30 day shred and though I've never done level 3- I was getting bored and so decided to purchase her new dvds. If you're not familiar with Jillian she is a tough, almost mean trainer and I love her for it. Her style is such that you will not be misled into thinking you can lose weight without considerable effort, and this and 'No more trouble zones' require much effort.The workout is 50 minutes: 5 min warm-up, 6 circuits totalling 40 mins and then a 5 min cooldown- no equipment needed. There's lots of jumping which might aggravate knee problems but otherwise excellent. There is more rest than during the 30 day shred dvd. It is definitely more than worth the price"
4,Sometimes Straight to DVD doesn't mean its ab bad movie,"I watched this movie because I had a free code for Redbox; I was scanning videos and I thought that this was a good premise for a movie. I agree with another reviewer that the ending was somehow less than what I expected, however, it also was one of those endings that leads the viewer to come to their own conclusion. You have nine people in a room and the truth is that they know each other, but they don't know how they know each other. On the surface, this is a suspenseful movie; underneath that, its a lesson about how the choices we make in life, affect the lives of others. Great movie!"
4,pretty good suspense.bad ending,"this was a very good straight to video movie about 9 people who are captured by a masked man and each hooded and handcuffed in the same room. The masked man gives them 10 minutes to explain why are they here and how they are all connected to the masked man, if not one person meet their deaths. fills with a lot of suspense and a good storyline. I don't want to give away the ending but it didn't sit well with me but other than that it was a very good movie. Check it out."
4,"Great, until the ending","Yes, this film is clearly a bit of an homage to the Saw series, but it is different enough to be interesting. The characters are decent enough, if a bit generic. However, the plot itself is very good. Granted, it's a bit unrealistic insofar as the killer managed to find out the relevant information that not only started the scheme, but also linked many of the nine captives to the background story. However, the film is very suspenseful and builds up quite nicely. However, I agree with just about all of the other reviewers in that the ending came out of nowhere. The writers clearly intended it to be open-ended, but either that type of ending doesn't work well for this film, or the closing shot could have been done much better. Still, a very solid piece of work."
1,Great thriller --- without an ending,"This movie is one of the best thrillers I have seen in years. Tight, fast moving, intense drama. The film makers only made one critical error --- they left out the ending. It's like they ran out of money or something and simply said 'okay, that's a wrap'.With an ending, ANY ending, I would have given this film a 5 star rating. Alas, I can only give it 1 star for being one of the most frustrating films I have ever wasted 2 hours of my life on.Give this one a miss ... if you're not into frustration."
3,Nine Dead,"A masked maniac locks nine strangers in a room together and reveals that he will kill one of them every ten minutes until they can figure out the factor that connects them all. As the clock starts to tick, the desperate prisoners scramble to solve the malevolent mystery in time to save their own lives. The acting, sets and story are quite average. Yes the movie is a lot like the idea of Saw. Actually not that bad, but not that good either."
3,Good film... except for an inconclusive ending.,"There has been several films similiar to this in plot for example House of Nine, The Killing Room, Saw...etc. Take a number of good looking strangers throw them in a sticky situation and see if they can survive together. Nine Dead does have some good points to it the suspense build up is done quite well. The acting is decent and the movie grabs your interest in trying to find out why this is happening to these individuals, also how they're all connected to each other and how they got into this treadful situation. The only major flaw in this movie is the ending, it offers no redeeming or significant conclusion at all. When you watch the movie and it comes to the very ending you'll see what I mean. The directors could of came up with a better conclusive ending.Neal Damianowww.ctfilmshorts.comfilm critic"
2,Where the eff was the ending?,"Ok, film makers, I know you read these reviews:Where was the ending? That was lame as hell.The movie was good but you ruined it with no ending.How can I recommend a movie to anyone when it just ends?Weak as hell. You should be ashamed.Would have been a solid three stars (and a recommendation) with an ending."
3,HEAVY HART,"Another entry in the school of torture flicks actually has a complex albeit somewhat implausible storyline. Melissa Joan Hart stars as one of the victims--I've never considered her a great actress and reinforces that opinion in this heavy-handed, oft laughable performance. The others are merely average.The film is akin to SAW, but less gory. It held my interest even with its weird sudden ending. More a rental option than a purchase."
5,Entertaining,I thought this movie was captivating and entertaining which is all I really ask of my celluloid. Maybe it wasnt original but what is really? I think the acting was great and I know it was shot on the Red Camera which is interesting to me. The story was enough to keep me wrapped up for 90 mins. 5 stars for me!
3,Good Mystery,I received the movie in the time period indicated and the condition advertised . . . no nicks or skips and it played just fine. Based on these factors I would recommend this seller to anyone and would buy future products from this seller with no worries.This mystery presenting a very enchanting plot and the charachters played their parts very well. It was a good mystery right up to the very end. I liked it.Larry
3,Enjoyable but flawed,"I could appreciate the idea behind this, but the delivery just wasn't good. It's not that I have anything personal against Melissa Joan Hart, but she wasn't the best actress for the role. Also, the whole thing with one person dying every ten minutes until someone figures out why they're all in there is a rather flimsy premise. These people weren't able to figure it out themselves without some prodding from their captor.And good lord, the ending! If you could even call it one... Well, it started off well enough (which is why I gave it its overall rating) but it just failed in the end. It's clear that this movie was trying to succeed in its own way like Saw, but it just didn't work."
4,Interesting,"I love movies where you must try to figure out where it is going. Nine Dead is such a movie. Clues are given throughout. The ending resulting in compiling these clues and coming up with the ""aha"" moment of realizing why the event happened. Highly recommend!"
5,Great Product,I bought this valet for my husband for Christmas. He was using a towel to put all his pocket stuff on. He loves this valet and it's very well made. It's not to big or too small. Thank you.
4,"Nice, even better in person.","I ordered this as a Christmas present for my friend. He loved it. Originally I was trying to get a monogrammed one, but the ones I found online and in stores were a little over the top. This one was perfect, fit the need and good quality. Really, the reviews helped me decide this was the product I was looking for. The reviews especially helped because the price almost seemed to good to give me the quality I was looking for. All in all it was a wonderful buy. Amazon has not disappointed me yet."
3,It is fine,"This is fine, but not great. I got it for my husband, he likes it and uses it, my complaint is that the little covered compartment door seems flimsy and doesn't fit well. I think the hinge is only fabric maybe. But it is fine, and I guess for the price it is perfectly fine. :-)"
5,Great tray.,This was a gift for my husband and it definitely stands up to him throwing his stuff in there. Works perfectly.
4,Valet,I was just what I was looking for so that small items don't roll around in the draw.My husband liked it very much
1,Incorrect size,"This Bead Profile Exterior Door Rail And Stile Shaper Cutter Set does not fit 1 3/4"" doors. It is for 1 3/8"" doors."
4,My son loves it!,"I searched everywhere to find a basket that was gender neutral for my son's tricycle. He loves this one. It is lightweight yet nice size for him to haul toys, drinks, mail, etc. The hardware didnt work with the shape of his handlebars so I attached it with zip ties and am saving the hardware for use with his next bike."
4,White Bike basket,This is a great bike basket... it aint as big but for my lil sister it was perfect.. the only thing was that it didnt come with the screws but besides that this basket is great
5,best of the Hovhaness recordings I own,"I own several recordings of Alan Hovhaness' music and this is the best. The pieces contained are good exemplars of his best work. Symphony #6 is episodic in its structure but contains some of his most mystically atmospheric material and is not overly repetitive. Opp. 128 & 53 are nice works. The Prayer of Saint Gregory might be his best work. The playing here is really good and the sound is also good -- a nice sharp image, good depth. This is an excellent introduction to this somewhat obscure composer."
4,A Real Sistah Sangin'....,"...ok. I dig Winbush, OK? Treat U Rite and her version of Inner City Blues were top 40 hits 'round here in these parts, but there's a power ballad with she and Isley that's just too cool that was essentially overlooked. And my favorite on here is the simply intricate Sensitive Heart which could be a stepper's tune if was released in this life time. Heck, I tellya what. It *is* a stepper's tune for mine. Oh. Did I mention that I think Winbush is gorgeous?"
