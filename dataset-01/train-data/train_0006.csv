1,Misguided and unclear product info,I bought this clamp and it turns out I need digital multimeter to operate it. I do not understand DMMs means before . After i received it and read the intruction then I understood. I wished that the ad could be more clearer. I have not returned it yet because it cost money to send it back.Any suggestion ? Mean a while I already bought another fluke amp meter that does not need another digital meter to operate it.
2,wrong amp rating on website,"The Fluke current clamp works properly but the Amazon website listed the device as having 1000amp capacity. Actual specification is only 400 amps. Since I'm monitoring an 800 amp, AC service it's not too helpful. Please fix the website. Product description as of 05/06/12 says 1000amp AC/DC.In the technical details it would be very, very helpful if you would attach pdf's of the manuals and spec sheets."
3,WHOLE PECANS EXPECTED; NOT FOUND,"I was expecting whole pecans. I was disappointed to find nothing but crumbles. I can still use the crumbles on ice cream, but I would have preferred whole pecans"
1,Might as well buy it at the apple website,"It's $39.00 on the apple website, there is free shipping as well, so why buy it on amazon? I came here looking for a deal and was disappointed."
1,I don't get it,"Why does everyone rave about this? One of the reviews even says, ""If you need this then get it."" Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."
4,Tasty Early Power Pop/Punk,"Ever since I became hooked on the song ""Lovers and Fools"" from college radio back in the mid-80's, I have searched for material from the Rich Kids. Although the original mix was muddy sounding, Cheery Red Records did its best to clean it up the sound of their debut album. This high energy material conjures up comparisons to the Buzzcocks and a bit of The Damned. Don't worry, Midge Ure's vocals are still able to penetrate the slightly muffled production of the material."
3,A Background,"This is a book for people who want to know more about T.E. Lawrence than just the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" legend. It is not a book for people who only have a passing interest in the man.It is a slim volume that relates to one of his pre-WW1 journeys to Syria looking at Crusader and Arab castles pursuant to his interest in archeology and especially fortresses constructed during the Middle Ages. The book would be improved with a map and a glossary. Lawrence uses a number of Arabic words in his text whithout the benefit of an explanation.For people wanting a more detailed knowledge of Lawrence there are better books. This is for someone wanting an in-depth knowledge of the man."
3,"Fun, but pricey.","I thought it had an advantage over the collapsable tubes which my cats think are for collapsing and walking away from. This one is a little small for larger cats. My cats were spooked by the crinkly lining at first, find the hole in the center the most interesting part, like it, but spend more time with wrapping paper and cardboard boxes."
4,Came for Antony. Stayed for Marc.,"I had been a Marc fan for some time, emphasis on the past tense because his output became so repetitively prodigious that somewhere circa Fantastic Star I threw in the towel. (I mean, who has that kind of room on their cd shelves? And just how many albums can you release with the word Star in the title?) I picked this up because I'm a huge Antony fan and love ""Ballad of the Sad Young Men."" M&A do a good job on it (although it's nowhere near as focused or ultimately arresting as Anita O'Day's read), but I was even more pleasantly surprised with the unexpected excellence of the rest of the disc. The covers are surprisingly sharp, often unexpected and exceedingly well-chosen (love the resurrection of the Barry Ryan and especially the Dana Gillespie - perhaps he's saving ""Weren't Born a Man"" for a b-side?). Best surprise? The one original damn near outshines the lot. Welcome back, Marc!"
2,single song makes it worth it,"Almond sings off-key, but that is a longstanding trademark , and, oddly, creates a weird appeal regarding his singing style. The songs however are a combination of irritating and boring, with the notable exception of his duet with Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. Their mutual effort is a winner and, if unavailable on other discs, makes this disc worth having."
3,hm,"There are mistakes IN this book! :) But still, I'm not sorry I got it, there are a few good morsels here."
2,"Old and free is no way to sell your books, son.","If you need a grammar reference, this may well serve until you find a better one. It might be of greater utility if the tone wasn't vaguely condescending and pedantic, and it eschews the panoply of actual examples in favor of definitions. To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of ""to love"" results in ""If you have been loved..."" gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate ""falar"" and need to know which one to use.--#"
1,If the title is incorrect...,"If you REALLY want to write correct, you won't write ""correctly."" Yes, it's in common use but it is, by the rules of grammar, incorrect. It's an overcorrection, an unnecessary addition. Here's a simple rule of thumb: Substitute the word ""fast"" where you're thinking of adding an -ly. Would you say ""How to Speak and Write Fastly?"" No. Same part of speech, but it somehow escaped that stupid -ly trap."
4,Effective,"I found the information timeless. Yes, somethings sounded dated because of time. Yet it did not take away from the content."
3,"Good, but short","Very short and quick read. Good for high-level overview, but does not have a lot of details. Good thing I got it for free."
4,Very helpful!!,Very nice book! I am very happy with all the information on this book. It explains a lot of english grammar!
3,hard to read,"It was hard to read for me, besides i didn't find anything fun, the author decided to explain basics of language and not go into how to speak intelligently. However i still learned many things."
5,How To Speak and Write Correctly,It has been a long time since high school and college English classes. This book helped me remember things I did not realize I had forgotten. Order it today. See what you forgot!! I would give more stars if it were possible!!!
1,Too Much Info,This book should have been written more as a novel than a how to. This book goes into story like dimensions and there are others better written on the subject.
2,"This is a gem, for a CERTAIN KIND of reader","If you know it all already, this is a good book for you to buy. If you are looking for grammar instruction, look elsewhere. This little book was written 75 years ago and it has things worth thinking about, but it is not a grammar book, or a book on speaking, or a book on writing. I just bought it and am delighted to rummage about in it. It's a GEM. It's worth the money by a mile and a half. I gave it two stars only to not be lost in the shuffle. Buyers often don't look at 50 rave shill reviews but they'll look to see who doesn't like and why. So maybe I caught some readers. This is a good buy IF you KNOW IT ALL. It's not instruction, it's food for thought."
3,not bad for a freebie,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
3,Nice,"Nice read, there is a lot to learn on this subject and just getting into the reading of this book."
3,Missing info,"This book was pretty good, although a little out of date as other reviewers mentioned. I can't complain too much, since this book was free, but it lacked a lot from the missing illustrations. In several sections the examples were completely omitted, most notably the section on letters. This really took away from the book."
4,Good Book,A very informative book. Good for reference. Book price was affordable. Very helpful and a good read. Liked the book.
3,New is Better,"What a wonderfully obscure survey of grammar of the 19th century! Completely hard to read for ESL learners and speakers of English alike! If you would like to UNDERSTAND English articles, try this nifty little study guide,Mastering A An The - English Articles Solved - An English Grammar Study Guide. It is well-written, and more importantly, it goes directly to the all important point."
3,Outmoded,"It is good. But really old. Of not much use to those interested in contemporary English. Most grammar and usage rules do not change dramatically, so the book continues to have merit. Yet the treatment is too formal for those with little patience."
3,Not bad,"As a non- english speaker backgorund person, this book reveals many secrets of the English language. However, I was expenting to see more examples about the gramma explained in the book. Too much theory makes it a bit bore to read it and understand it."
4,Smooth Feel but costly,"I loved the product, but when I went back to get another bottle, I discovered it had nearly doubled in price....so no thanks...I'll find something else."
4,NUCLEAR WAR!,"A must-have for any fan of Thrash Metal. Blacky's meat-grinding bass sound and Snake's Venom-like vocals will make you wish you were born a Voivodian. However, the production sounds somewhat inadequate. Having seen Voivod live this past summer perform two of these tracks (""Nuclear War"" and ""Voivod""), I thought they sounded MUCH better in concert than on the album. Still, it's WAR & PAIN!"
3,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this cd. I love not only Adiemus, but all of Karl Jenkins's other works. This, however, is not up to his usual caliber. One example: the last track, Boogie Woogie LLanoogie, sounds like the soundtrack to chase scenes from episodes of ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo."" The only good track on this cd is number four, Dona Nobis Pacem Part I. None of the other tracks have the power of any of the tracks compiled on ""Karl Jenkins: The Journey, The Best of Adiemus."""
3,Some hits some misses...,"...but on the whole, more hits than misses. I especially like The Protector (the first Adiemus track with recognizable words). Another good track is Dona Nobis Pacem, Pt. 2. On the miss side is the Boogie Woogie Llanoogie. Another reivewer hit it spot in comparing it to Scooby Doo music. Also Dona Nobis Pacem, Pt. 1 didn't do much for me. While the album doesn't rise to the standard of Adiemus 1, it is a solid addition to the Adiemus library."
5,Masterpiece.,"Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection."
3,Spinning the wheels...,"although not a bad album, American Don is not a good one. I suppose what it lacks is that element of surprise that seem to come with all of their previous releases. There aren't many standout moments, though the weird drone of ""The Peter Criss Jazz"" comes close. Much like the new Sea And Cake, American Don shows a band that has stayed with a formula, and doesn't want to try to expand on it further. P.S. Ian Williams is still pedal-master extrodinaire, and Mr Che is still a formidable drummer. I guess you'd call it too much of a good thing..."
5,AN INCREDIBLE BOOK!!!,"This book was riveting from the first page! I couldn't put it down and ignored children, laundry, and dishes until I reached the end. Adams brilliantly weaves her characters through an 'end of days' experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat (At least it kept me on the edge of mine!) Can't wait for book three!"
1,"Two Words: Terrible ""Author""","Great book if you want to read the self-indulgent ramblings of delusional, holier-than-thou person with an 80 at best IQ. NOT recommended."
3,"Great viewing, but the running time is WRONG.","The content of this program is great...just what I hoped far, aside from the fact that the performance clips were short and truncated. Great interview segments though, and the video footage is definitely rare and precious for fans of the Yardbirds, Clapton, Beck and Page. My only real gripe is that the running time is only HALF of what it claims (1 hr. 45 min.). After the show is over, it just repeats itself! What a dirty trick...of course, it's no big deal since the video is so cheap. I would have bought it even if they had listed the running time accurately as 52 minutes. Maybe it's just an honest error, but they should fix that so that there are no unpleasant surprises."
3,No há legendas em ingls no show (live),"No há legendas em ingls no show(live)! Mas no geral é bom. Só no posso praticar o idioma. É um bom show que traz as músicas antigas como o sucesso ""Nice and slow"""
5,WOW!,This is an awesome CD. The title track will put you in a state of mind that makes other music become just noise.A truly talented man.
4,An 80's classic!,I don't know what it is about this movie but it's a classic 80's flick! Mark Harmon is at his best. The plot is a little predictable but it's entertaining and takes you back to the decade past.
5,This One Will Surprise You,"I was so happy to see this came out on DVD, finally. This is a longtime favorite movie of mine. I love to share it with friends who have never seen it; they invariably enjoy it as much if not more than me. Believe it or not, it's a great ""date movie"" to cuddle up with....there are enough plot twists to make the story, at one time or another, enjoyable for just about everyone, and yet nobody will be turned off by them. This movie is great fun....enjoy!!!!"
2,"Not good, not bad","If you like early Mark Harmon, then it is worth the time. Otherwise, it is a made for TV style situation comedy. There are some embarrassing moments and a heart-warming ending."
1,Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete,"I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded."
1,Looks like it was Printed on a cheap broken down Printer,Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
3,It goes on and on and on,"This is a well written book that just won't stop. You see the end from about page 20, but it keeps on with the story anyway. It's romance pure and simple. No complicated subplots. By about page 50, you feel like yelling ""What are you, blind"" to the two major characters. Alas they are. Read it if you like a good love affair. I don't."
5,Great,Great movie. I had to watch it for class and I actually enjoyed it!! It's in French but you won't even realize you're reading the subtitles
4,Good Movie,"Good movie if you dont mind subtitles. I like that it is around 1 1/2 hours, good for my attention span."
4,Entertaining,"There is something painful in the movie in the circumstance that the company retains an employee just out of reverse discrimination (that is, because they believe that he is gay and so is firing-proof). This is a REAL matter that is happening often--whether the reverse discrimination is against whites, straights, or men.Apart from this, the movie is entertaining and it has serious and worthwhile scenes amidst the farce. Worth seeing."
4,One of the funniest films you'll ever read.,"First, the full disclosure: I am not the kind of person that likes foreign films. Having said that, I highly recommend The Closet. Sure it's in French with English subtitles, but if you don't normally watch foreign films you'll be amazed at how quickly you forget that you're reading subtitles. This is a genuine laugh out loud movie, and how many comedies really fall into that category?Keep in mind there is a lot of sexual content, and if you are easily offended this is not for you. However, if you are looking for a comedy that's a bit different (and much funnier) than the latest Adam Sandler movie, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,"Totally nutty, but thoughtful satire, poignant and goofy.","I thought this movie was hilarious. Depardieu, who usually plays more serious roles - had me laughing hysterically. Behind all the silliness is an intelligent satirical commentary on business, lifestyle choices, over-the-top political correctness, hang-ups. Everything gets made fun of, still poignant and totally nutty. A gem."
5,Delightful and funny,"This was a really funny movie. I usually don't like reading sub-titles, but I hardly even noticed them because the movie was so good. The humor is understated and well-done. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Daniel Auteuil is fabulous,I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
3,There's good and bad,"The performances are excellent, especially Depardieu. There are some genbuine laughs, but as someone else pointed out, it is a one-joke film, and there are parts where it gets out of hand, or tedious or unbelievable. See it, but buy it cheap or rent it."
2,Nothing to Write Home About,"Nice in theory, but doesn't really do the trick. We thought the longer shaft and small profile would make it easy to hold it in the right spot during intercourse to give me the extra zing necessary. The problem is, the surface is difficult to press up against the right spot. If the paddle had a nub on it or it was convex would make it a lot better.I was also disappointed in the speed/strength. In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase. The strength is a little much to start off, and usually not enough after a short while. It would be nice if the power were adjustable.Positive: Very easy to clean - waterproof - inexpensive - slender design makes it easy to bring with you anywhere."
1,Foam Ripoff,"The most uncomfortable, overpriced piece of foam on the market. Also beware that there is a 10 day return policy on this piece of junk."
3,Not quite what I hoped for.,"I've had this pillow for about three weeks. My GERD symptoms haven't subsided much. I tried going without my meds for about three days and the heartburn came back during the day...I didn't get it at night. I still clear my throat but not as much as I did before I bought this pillow and I still get the congestion,cough, and lump in my throat. Based on the reviews I've read I expected to suffer no symptoms of GERD. I don't know if I need to seriously alter my diet or what but it didn't live up to my expectations. Boo."
4,Bed wedge is perfect size,"The bed wedge, combined with a Brookstone neck pillow, is giving my asthmatic husband the best sleep he has in years. The slant is gradual, and the pillow is wide enough to accommodate a man's wide shoulders, and still leave ample room for me in our double bed."
5,If you didn't already know...,"This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"
5,Captivating and fascinating!,"From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."
4,A big read - if you have the time,"I'm almost finished this book and can't wait to get on to the others. This is entertaining, engrossing and educational. It has taken me forever to get through it but I'm learning so much about our ancient ancestors that it's worth each page."
2,Typos abound,"I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will."
5,The Clan of the Cave Bear,"An excellent AUEL written story that you cannot put down, Many suprises, and life as it was thousands of years ago. EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATION."
5,I'm going nuts!,"PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!"
5,Take a walk on an awesome journey into the past,"It's a wild ride that you will take with Ayla as she learns what the world around her is all about. This book is a real treat. Start with this one (it is the first in a series of four, soon to be five books) and keep going. Jean Auel is definitely talented. Enjoy"
2,Great Title Not a great narrator,"I found Sandra Burr choppy and irritating to listen to. Her voice was not what I expected. There is another version of this book narrated by another woman whose voice is smooth, and can put you to bed. Yet she tells the tale with enough excitement and with different tones for each character that you are compelled to listen ALL DAY!The plot is wonderful, though if you want to listen instead of read, I don't reccomend the Sandra Burr narration. I reccomend the one read by Rowena Cooper. AMAZING!"
2,Failed attempt at female empowerment,"The basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical (or pre-historical?) fiction. However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal ""mind meld"" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."
1,This book is AWEFUL,"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."
5,Great book if you like the ice age...........,I loved this book. I have read it and the rest in the series at least 5 times. Not only were they fun to read I also felt they were educational and Jean Auel did so much research to try and make the books as accurate as possible.
5,The Clan of the Cavebear,"The book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Excellent book, I would recommend it highly. It is evident that the author did extensive research before writing the book."
4,A good book,"This book is absolutely awesome. However, if you aren't interested in The history of man kind, then I sugguest you read another book. While reading the book, I almost felt like I was the main character and it kept the pages turning. This indicates a great book that is worth reading!"
5,These stories are fascinating!,"I have the whole series on my Kindle Fire, and I love to read them over and over again. THey are really good reading."
5,The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear.,I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
5,Wonderful Description Of Life During The Ice Age,"Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I ""read the book"" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."
4,"VERY GOOD, I WAS IMPRESSED AND WILL READ MORE","I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?"
1,Amature.,"I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
3,Irregularly labeled disks,"There are 17 disks in this CD set. They're numbered 1-17. However, when I load them into my player, they loaded out of order (not numbered the same as they're labeled). Disk #6 loaded as ""The Shelters of the Stone, disk 12"". I haven't listened to all of them yet to know if they also play out of order, but given the return policy once it's opened, I'm not confident I'll get satisfaction. The labeling is confusing enough."
4,This is an amazing book.,"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"
4,A Moving Saga Of Earlier Times,"Jean M. Auel captures efficiently the changing times and landscape of the Neanderthals and the passing of evolution towards the more modernly advanced Cro-Magnons. The story not only provides excellent descriptions of nature and climate at the time, but also captures the customs of the people. The highlight of the novel revolves around the medicinal plants and herbs that are constantly brought up through Iza and Ayla's work as medicine women. The low points of the novel are some of the repetitive elements in Auel's description of the landscape and certain details repeated verbatim. However, the story clings to you as you flip the pages hurriedly, trying to find out about the next stages in Ayla's life. Overall, a good and worthwhile read."
2,"Oh, puhleeeeaze!","I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
2,Compelling story but reads like a textbook,"The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."
5,The Clan Of The Cave Bear,"Loved the story. And have now read the next book Valley Of The Horses, and am in the process of getting the third book, The Mammoth Hunter. Great Author."
5,Great book!,I love this book! The entire series!=) Everyone should read it. You feel you are actually there through the story.
5,"Fabulous book, couldn't put it down!","I loved this book, and I can't wait to buy The Valley of Horses. The way Ms. Auel could create such an intricate culture amazed me. Her writing techniques combined with a wonderful plotline make for an incredibly enjoyable book."
5,"Excellent! Non-stop reading, I couldn't put it down.","This book was the first ever I had read of its kind. Not usually into the prehistoric era, I found that I fell in love with the characters. I cried and laughed with them. I am looking forward to her fifth book of the series."
3,Captivating,"Back in the 80's when the book was written, I didn't read it because it wasn't factual and scientifically accurate. It seems that with the passing of time, I've become more interested in a good story line and less critical of journeys into the realm of pure fantasy.The story is captivating. A child found and raised by a tribe of people from another branch of the human evolutionary tree. As the child grew to be a woman she was accepted by the tribe. She was valued, even loved but always different. Jean Auel has created a wonderful character in Ayla, smart, practical, loyal and loving, yet fundamentally different from the people she shares her life with. Fascinating from start to finish this book will leave you wanting more. Happily there are more books which continue the story of Ayla and I plan to read them soon."
4,Wow...this is one of my favorite books ever!,"The Clan of the Cave Bear is very, very good. However, I only gave it four stars because it is a bit long-winded and its sentences run on. (It would have a long phrase, a comma, and then another long phrase. It got kind of tiring.) Ayla's abilities do not seem unnatural to me; Jean Auel did an excellent job of sculpting them into the story. Whoever said that Jean Auel ""really, really wants to be blond"" is sadly mistaken."
4,Amazing,"It was a co-worker who recommended to read this series.. I was sceptical at firstespecially as my Husband said he had the hard copies, and I didn't even know it.But once started, it was not easy to put down. The description of events, surroundings and the Clan people, were amazing..so much so I bought the second book ""The Valley of Horses"".."
2,Clan of the Cave Bear,"This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read."
5,The Clan of the cave bears,"I read almost all of these books many, many years ago and found them so interesting - am loving The Clan again, and will probably order the entire set in time. So nice not to have the usual voilence, although the primitives were sometimes pretty rough, but in a more natural way! Just lovely night-time reading whilst the hubby snores!!! So good to have something to read in the dark."
3,clan of the cave bear,"Loved it, but is rated R! I read this when I was in my twenties and loved it then. Reread it now in my 40s and still loved it. The whole series is good but the first one is the best."
4,"original, and discriptive, Jean displays her imagination on","paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%"
4,I really enjoy the series.,"Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book."
2,Its really just a harlequin novel,"If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc."
5,MY WIFE ABOUT FELL OVER!,"She had a older book in paper back, but the ex tore it up in spite. I got her the hard back, and she nearly broke my back with excitment!!! She was nearly in tears she was so happy."
3,the book is too wordy,this book is very wordy and takes a long time to finish. i started last week and iam currently in the middle of the book. in some places you get lost
1,"No plot, No Characters","One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them. Why the author felt she had to abandon any attempt at subtlety, and write as if the readers were as ignorant as her characters seem to be is beyond me."
5,Great. Really Great.,"I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces."
5,Very good,I rated that good because this book grabbed my attention inmediatly. Not only is intersting but also instructive. I recommends it to everybody. Regards.
1,Boring,Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.
4,Great Series,This book was very different. Who would have thought you could write a work of fiction from Cave Man days. It kept my attention and I can't wait to start on the second book in this series.
4,Interesting,Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.
5,Neato,"This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."
5,The details in this book will blow your mind.,"I loved this book so much. Ayla is sure to be a classic in liturature to come in the next decade or so. She is a great role modle. I think this woman has major courage! If this is your first book in the series, keep reading it's worth the time and effort, I promise!"
5,A GREAT book. The Great Book.,"I got this book for Christmas, and was hesitant to read it, because it sounded a little boring. But I brought myself to read it, and loved it! I loved every word! It is 500 pgs, and I read it in 3 days. It was so excellent. Jean Auel expressed Ayla's feeling, Broud's hatred, Iza's love, and Creb's frustration. It was a wonderful story!"
4,A little much for a 14 year old,"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the ""clans"" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"
5,The Best Book Ever!,"The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"
5,Stunning,What an amazing and visually stunning book. It has been years since I have read anything that has shook me to the core of my humanity. This book has done just that. Will be reading this entire series. Such a prolific and dynamic writer. So glad my mother in law introduced me to this author.
4,Couldn't put it down!,There is something both mundane and exciting about this book. I read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story and the author has put so much research into it. A must-read for all women interested in prehistoric culture and even men who don't mind books with a good believeable heroine.I first started this book when I was 17 but couldn't get into it at first because of the apparent mundanity of the story. But I discovered later that the beauty is in the details with this book. The characters and the author's descriptions of the landscape and culture of the people are just wonderful.I highly recommend this as an addition to a fantasy collection.
5,Classic,"While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."
5,A tour de force in literature,"I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."
1,"I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But...","I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."
2,Kindle's edition is full of typos,The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books.
2,"Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.","Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
5,I've read it countless times,"This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"
4,review: Clan of the Cave Bear,"This is a story of total humanity. The characters are real and captivating. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! If anyone asks me for books to read, I would definately reccomend this book. Clan of the Cave Bear also tought me to be who I am. Dare to be different. This was a great book!"
5,Fantastic series....have read every one,"This is one of the better book series out there. You grow to love the characters, and they are quite realistic. Talk about going back in time because of a book! Jean Auel has a wonderful way of doing that for the reader. Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."
5,clan of the cave bear,"It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels. I never gave any thought to people of this time in our history. But from the first paragra your mind carries you away to a new adventure, which gives promise to a long and happy union."
5,Amazing book,"Finished reading this last night. Amazing story!!! It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading. I loved the language; can't remember the last time I read a book that taught me SO many new words!!! & the story line? good grief....... I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"
1,"Tripe, and not very good tripe at that","lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash."
5,Clan of the cave bear,This book came within a week of when I ordered it. It was in good condition and I am enjoying it.
2,Neanderthal Sexists,"This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters ""made the sign"" indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs."
1,Horrid!,"I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."
3,Not my cup of tea!,"I like historical novels but this one was hard for me to get in to. Maybe just need to set it down and try again in the future. My mother raved about it, which is why I bought it!"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,Jean Auel is a wonderful writer! Her books magiacally come alive. Impossible to put down once it has been started! The best book I have read in my lifetime!
5,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
5,Where is N 5 and 6,I've read the 4 books by Jean M. Auel (twice). I'm sure the story has not ended yet. I cannot sleep because I want to know what happens next. Please Mrs. Auel could you finish the other books as you entended to do ? A suggestion : the story is very strong on its own. No need to waste paper by inserting a full description of their love-life every twenty pages. I'm sure you did it for commercial reasons and not because the story is incomplete without these descriptions. Thanks for the many hours of joy I had with your books. Hope I did not make to many mistakes in English.Anita
4,Cave Woman,"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."
5,Clan Of The Cave Bear by Jean Auel,A beautiful story. Couldn't put it down. So well written that I felt like I was there with Ayla and the clan.
5,A novel you will be reading into the early morning hours,While reading this series it seemed to always slip into my mind throughout anytime of the day. It became so facinating that I would ponder it constantly. I am marveled at the talent Mrs.Auel has been blessed with and grateful she has shared her blessings and given us a true heroine in Ayla. This will been a series I will treasure and will love to read again and again.The time she has put into researching truely paid off.You feel as if you are right there treking along on the steppes. Reading this series has been such a wonderful experience.
5,Excellent!!!,"My best friend first introduced these books to me probably when I was 14 or 15. Since then, I have not been able to put them down. I don't know how many times that I've read, and re-read these books. They still get me every time. The detailing and description really makes me think, and visualize what Ayla sees. I often wish that I could be her, sees what she sees, and Jondalar! How cute is he? I know every book almost off by heart. I know what's coming, and how they will all end, but I still anticipate and agonize every time. I haven't bought many other books because the Earth's Children Series always satisfies, and leaves me wanting more. I too, am anxious for the next book(s) to come out. Hurry up already!"
5,"MAJESTIC, AMAZING, CAPTIVATING","I read this book for the first time when I was 14 years old. Since that time, I got the others in the series. I cannot tell you how many times I have read and reread this story, as well as the others. At one time, they came together in paperback, and I bought it. Now, they are so ragged they are held together by tape. I have been awaiting the time when Mrs. Auel comes out with another book. I would definetely be in line for that one."
5,Excellent Book,One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word.
5,A Must-Read book and series,"I purchased this copy of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" to help complete the set of ""Earth's Children"" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."
5,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation,Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
4,Nice for NYG Fans!,Very nice Floor Mats. Bought these for my Honda Civic and they work great. Super deal. Shipping was very fast and they were exactly as I expected. A little small so they should fit just about all vehicles. Might be too small for large trucks.
4,Nice Car Mats,"This product is made of durable material and has managed to handle the salt and snow during the past winter months.If anything these floor mats would protect the ones that came with your car, even if you are not a Patriots fan."
2,Giants Mats,The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
5,Love My New Orleans Saints Floor Mats,"I am a New Orleans Saints fan and have been since the franchise began. I no longer live in New Orleans but I do still support the team. I wear Saints gear when they play and so does our dog. My entire family are die hard Saints fans. I fly my Saints flag on my car, so why not have the Saints floor mats. Every time I get in my car, I say ""geaux Saints!!!!"" The color is perfect for the interior of my vehicle. I would recommend the Saints floor mats to all Saints fans. I just wished there were mats for the rear."
1,trouble with car not matts,"Matt on driver side slides forward and I have not found a way to anchor it. It would be better if the Broncos had gone to the Super Bowl in 2013. The ""Prayer in thin Air"" did them in or was it ""The kneel down in D Town?"""
4,Pictures!,I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
3,Dated,"Abigail van Buren's column is oddly dated, and in some case simply ""off."" It is interesting to hear of her background and her relationship with Ann Landers. Her (mostly implied) view of married life in the 50ies and 60ies is a horror show, and maybe therefore enlightening. Younger readers may find it laughable. Still, her underlying humanness does stands up to the test of time, but just barely."
3,Has little value,"The plot is very thin, so the producers has to resort to a lot of female flesh to keep the male audience awake. This is the type of story that if you were to condense it by just the story line that was important to developing the plot, you could view it all in 30 mins. Sorry, because some good performances are wasted here."
3,"Very Nice Ring, I like It.","Very Beautifull Ring and nice design, i bought this armor ring and it is same as on the Picture,now i have a set, Thank you again."
5,book,"i have this book and bought it for my best friend. It has a lot of easy, inexpensive ideas; great reference book."
1,"poor quality backpack, don't buy...","I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!"
3,"Decent enough, but they cut corners","I've owned Jansport backpacks in the past, and while this is a decent enough bag, it's definitely not up to past quality. The material is thinner, the zippers are not as heavy-duty. And what's the deal, Jansport? Did you run out of zipper pulls? Half the zippers are missing them (despite what the picture shows)! Cheap!On the plus side, there are plenty of internal and external pockets, my large laptop fits without a fight, and it's well-padded."
3,"Adorable, Fictional Account of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln","Stern tells his story as though he were writing a novel, complete with dialogue and imagined scenes between his ""characters."" As such his book will be quite useless to conventional researchers, however, his narrative is certainly entertaining and helps to show the evolving 20th century misconceptions about the Lincoln assassination and John Wilkes Booth.Kara Sowles & Suzanne Davies"
5,A Civilization Swept Away,"The son of a Russian general, Prince Serge Obolensky grew up at the court of Nicholas II, and served as an officer in the Chevalier Guards in WWI. This is a remarkable tale of Obolensky's long and varied life - from student to soldier to City stockbroker to soldier again (this time as Lt. Col. in the US OSS in WWII) to hotel impresario in New York City. Married first to a Russian princess and later to Alice Astor, Obolensky was one of those rare 20th c. characters who ""knew everyone"". Yet he comes across in print as humble and self-deprecating. He was a leading representative of a civilization that was completely swept away by the 1917 Revolution. This is a good read; it is a pity it is not in print at present."
5,Un libro importante,"Por favor, no te importa mi español pobre, pero en serio no soy hispanohablante. Cuando tuve trece años esto libro mi mejora amiga me dio, y imediamente fue enamorado con su idioma, tema, y jugadores en una historia complicada y intimo. ""Mas Que Humano"" es un libro de los mas importantes del siencias, y de los libros intelligentes."
4,Another reason to suscribe to Prime,"This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn't suscribed to Amazon Prime. I'm not getting any perks, etc, for reccomending Amazon Prime, but one of the features is the instant video. While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good. I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein ofThe Descendants."
5,Not your usual romance movie,"This movie has a wonderful and fully devloped story that reveals itself slowly during the first part of the film. It is filled with family drama, sexual tension, and one mans deep love for his family when he knows he is dying. Well worth the long movie time, and being dubbed in English (I am American and don't speak Danish). I am still thinking about it today, after watching it yesterday evening."
5,one of my favorite films,Great film. Interesting narrative that is easy to follow. The story of a past love reintroduced and how a twenty year gap has effected those involved. A new family is melded as the original partners story is revealed. Beautifully shot and cast.
5,Superb Movie,"Great acting by all, love all the characters and the story, a real love story. Watching the deleted scenes and listening to the director interview really fills in the whole story and adds to the character motives. I enjoyed the spoken Danish. I'll enjoy watching it many times."
3,Great performances in a disappointing film,"A man who works with children at an Indian orphanage (Mads Mikkelson) is called back to his native Denmark to meet a mysterious man (Rolf Lassgard) who is willing to contribute a large sum to the financially strapped institution on the condition of a face-to-face meeting. This sets the stage for a number of surprises.The magnificent cast earns this film its three stars. Their work is so powerful that they elevate even the most contrived circumstances. However, they are really let down by director / co-writer Susanne Bier, who has fashioned a manipulative story that is pure soap opera. She also has an annoying visual style that is most exemplified by lots of close-ups of eyeballs and lips."
5,Great Movie!!!,Flawless... great movie with lots of heart and a beautiful perspective. Thoughtful story line that makes life hit home! Enjoy!
3,"Interesting for thought, but not terribly moving","Screen shots were a bit repetitive (close-ups of blinking eyes) -- one too many times that didn't evoke any feeling.The plot, up until the halfway mark was very good, interesting and moving - we finally understand Jorgen's weird behavior.However, the plot and the story line could have been improved once we get to the end in terms of the relationship between Jacob and Jorgen - something was a bit left out (but I can't put my finger on it.)The plot was interesting, although a bit melodramatic and not totally believeable, but thought-provoking nonetheless. The end was perfect in a way, ""from the mouths of babes."""
4,Hope for Film,"These are the first few words of the amazon.com product description: ""Equal parts weepy drama and soap opera"". This is a profoundly shallow and stupid description of this film. Fire the reviewer, Amazon!The story unfolds intelligently, the acting is believable and first class, and the overall effect is extremely moving. American movies should study this film. U.S. films, first of all, need to craft their stories instead of recycling the same old same old. I have the same advice regarding American casting: stop recycling the same old faces. Please!This movie makes me feel there is hope for the art form of film. American film makers take note!"
4,life,"what a wonderful movie for people that wants to watch how complications of life cam evolve into something that will will change your ideas for how YOU want things to be, and still be ok with. It could possibly happen in real life. bitter sweet. I cried but could also see the sweetness in how their lives completly changed pathways from how they thought it would be and how old roads ended up meeting again. It was all about life's ups and downs and about the message of staying to telling the truth and how people cope with that. I enjoyed the movie."
4,Tragic Drama,about past mistakes and future opportunities. It's better not to read a plot summary about this one because the main character only gradually finds out what is really going on. His orphanage in India is running out of funds unless he can get a Danish billionaire to consider his project more worthy of support than others he is considering. Of course the rich man has his own goals. It's up to the viewer to judge if they are realistic or noble. It isn't the typical cliche of poor man good and rich man bad. They both have their strengths and weaknesses.
2,The remix is different,"I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don't sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not."
4,Excellent Enz,"Although a little uneven, this release has two timeless ballads (""Iris"" and ""One Step Ahead"") and some rollicking good time pop songs (History Never Repeats, I Don't Wanna Dance, Hard Act To Follow) and the dazzling ""Ships"" which is one of my favorite Enz songs. Actually I think it is better than thier debut and shows a lot of growth."
3,The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization,"This book certainly attempts to show the merits of free-trade against the alternatives of protectionism, mercantilism or colonialism. However, Larsson's book left many things unsaid. His analysis is too anecdotal, and if I were a anti free-trader (which I am not), then I could by the same token come out and give a multitude of horror stories that are seem to be the result of free trade.Those of you who wish to buy a comprehensive defense of free trade, this book is not for you. This book is rather a good source of stories and vignettes that would be helpful in a bar argument with the big hairy white guy next to you. Instead, I suggest that you pick up Against the Dead Hand by Brink Lindsey; it is much more comprehensive and gives a concise and accurate history of the struggle to ""race to the top."""
2,Sunny Side Up,"I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book."
2,Art and Passion...but no Science,"A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport."
1,is that fencer attacking with a bent arm?,"and what is with the foot?Usually a preview should (as far as I know) show a good example that will motivate people to watch moreof it and this just isn't it...I haven't viewed the video or part you can download as yet but if this picture is an example of what it contains I am not too inclined to view more of it...what are these two fencers doing?is the one on the right attacking with a foot in the air,next arm and point way off target or are they retreating ?and if so what the .. are they doing? Balance?!?and the fencer on the left - are they attacking? bent arm? what is with the front foot?ok so maybe need to download it and view it but I have enough faults in my technique without viewing this....sorry was just looking up fencing on amazon and found this video download...sighand if you are wondering I have over 20 years of fencing - all three weapons and I like to think (some... may disagree...lol) that I am an ok fencer..."
1,Incorrect Order & Product Color Inconsistent,"I ordered:4 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft BeigeThey sent:3 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft Beige -- (Note: See Color inconsistency note below)1 - Almay Liquid Makeup (which I did not order)Each of the 3 Revlon bottles was labeled as ""05 Soft Beige"" but visually looking at the makeup through the glass bottles, side by side, the actual color was markedly inconsistent.Out of the 4 bottles which I ordered, and paid for, only 1 was usable.Due to their lack of accuracy on the order fulfillment and the lack of quality control of the product, I will not order from them again."
2,"""Age defying"" doesn't quite fit the product","I am a very young looking 61 years old woman. I don't wear foundation on regular basis, but sometimes I like to look extra nice. Revlon's age defiying foundation doesn't fit it's name. It looks good when you put it on, but after wearing it few hours, it magnifies every line on my face..actually I see some I never seen before. Honestly, if this is what make up foundation will do, I'll be much more content without it. Show me one that doesn't do it, and I'll become a believer... But surely, to call it age defying, it is simply not true!"
1,Not what she wanted,"Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she read a few pages and quit because it was too sad. I told her it had a good ending but she won't try again, be prepared for tears when you read this one."
1,sent wrong thing,"I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both books (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it. The book looked nothing like the picture and it was very cleared written that I was supposed to get both. I got jipped."
1,"A Child Called ""IT"" and The Lost Boy One Child 's Courage to Survive","Ordered this for Christmas about 3 weeks before it never came before or after, never had any response, very disappointed."
4,"Great Game, Few Annoying Bugs","This is a real good game. Very realistic, even down to the goal horns. Playing against NJ as The Mighty Ducks and hearing the goal horn from NJ brought back nightmares from Games 5 & 7.The only problems I have with the game is the jersey numbers. For example, I acquired Daniel Briere, and instead of letting me pick his jersey, the game automatically gave him #66. It's the little things that bother me. A game that is so good, shouldn't have that kind of glitch in it.If you can look past that, it is a great game, a must buy! I hope NHL 2K4 is just as good."
2,Over-rated!!,I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. Even NHL Face-off is better than NHL 2k3. The graphics are only average and the controls are horrible. It feels like the players are skating in sand. The replays are ok but this game doesn't even have a create-a-player option. Sega should stick to football and basketball. Sorry Sega but I miss your Genesis games!
2,THIS GAME STINKS!...,"The only way to score on this game is dekes, rebounds and defelections. The gameplay stinks, the commontary stinks, DO NOT...waist your money on this game."
1,Worst game I have ever played,"Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever."
5,Ridiculous replay value,"Path of Radiance is an incredible game that I've spent waaayyyy too much time on, simply because there are so many characters to choose from, and thus so many different tactics to use. It's an excellent turn based strategy game that requires much more planning and attention to enemy movement capabilities than other similar games (e.g. FF Tactics). The only real gripe I have with the game is the fact that you cannot revive characters once they die, so you may find yourself in the position of nearly complete with a stage when an enemy gets a lucky critical hit on one of your guys and destroys him, leading to you beating your controller against your head / swearing liberally as you reach for the reset button and prepare yourself for another hour of the same exact stage. Thus, I only gave it 4 ""fun"" stars, because having your characters die is definitely NOT fun. Otherwise, I love this game, and highly reccommend it."
4,A game with brains,"Not only does this game challenge your brain in the gameplay, but in the story as well. Inbetween strategizing, there is a an awesome story about class and race; its political and social strife, rife with emotion. While the story is complex and convoluted, it never loses its logical train of thought.I have but one gripe: the presentation is lacking. Though the character designs are top notch (the hawk king is awesome), the music is bland, and the gameplay and character interaction animation barely scratches what is possible on the Gamecube. I lived for the cutscenes, which were drop-dead gorgeous, but few and far between.Overall, a good game. A must for starving Gamecube owners. So buy this game and then maybe the next home console iteration (Revolution, please?) of the game has a bigger budget that could improve the presentation."
5,A Fantastic epic!,"This has got be one of the best games out there for the gamecube. The combat is simple and easy to learn, yet later on it soon get,s very complicated and fun at the same time. About 3% of the story is done through cinematic cutscenes and the voice acting is good. The graphics are beautiful and colerful and look great. everything also sounds good too. The story is showstopping and full of surprises and in terms of epic it can be compared to lord of the rings. Overall 10 out of 10!"
5,The BEST Fire Emblem!,"I don't know why this does not have 5 stars as the overal rating! Path of Radiance is fantastic!!!1: The charecters names are atleast sane unlike many of the other charecters in Fire Emblems.2: The charecters are also different from eachother and interesting!3: The storyline has much more to it than the others as well! I never get board or try hard to get to the fighting sequences like I did in Sacred Stones.If you have any interest in games, get this one it will definately be among your top 5!"
4,Very solid and fun game!,"This is a great game, a very good mix of turn based strategy and action. You play by moving your team around the grid, choosing what to do and then see the results. (Turn based strategy) From there, they give you up front action of the players in combat, etc. It's a good fun game. The only down side I see to to it is sometimes you really wanna dive into the game and they make you run through this long history/lore of the game to give you some background. So far, I've been unable to find a way to skip it aside from just pressing buttons until it goes away and lets you play. That is why I'm giving it 4/5 stars. Aside from that, great game. I'm playing it on my Wii with a GameCube controller and memory card. (Required if you play on the Wii)"
5,Pros and Cons,"This may be one of my favorite games ever. Here are its pros and cons.Pros:1. It has a good plot.2. There is also a strong main character that you don't have to worry about dying.3. You need to use at least some strategy to win.4. Pick who you want to fight in each battle from out of a possible 43 characters.5. Good art and cut scenes.6. A lot of hours of gameplay.7. Good replay value. If you're bored you can make a new game and try using different people and strategies.Cons:1. Can be confusing at first.2. A little to much talking between the battles. Sometimes, when I would be in a hurry, I would have to skip the plot in order to save the game.Can go either way:When a character dies in battle you can't get him back. Instead you have to restart the level. However it also adds more strategy to the battles.9/10I beleive this game is worth buying."
4,A must read for Kilmer fans.,Val Kilmer put much of his heart and soul into his work. You can feel his feelings while reading through the poetry. Some of it may be a bit hard to understand if you do not know the man personally but you get the general idea of what he wants to get accross.
1,"RIP OFF, STOLEN WORKS","Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Instead buy the REAL thing, ""Let There Be Light"", by Darius Dinshah. Nothing else to say. Rip Off of Darius Dinshah's father's works!!!!!!!"
1,Reminds me of a joke...,What do you call the medical school student who graduates at the bottom of the class? Doctor.
3,Read dragonling,I really liked it because it fun reading about a dragon and a kid tht found a dragon and he cared about the dragon. well if you like a dragon as a friend you should read this book it is a good book just read and find out what happens to the kid and the dragon.
3,Wish the pictures were included.,"As a graduate student in history, I know that the Edward Lear original included hilarious illustrations that make this work even better and, therefore, the reading more enjoyable. The poems are fun but it would have been nice if it included the pictures."
1,Disappointed,"I ""bought"" this book for Kindle. All I got when I tried to read the book was a list of numbers that didn't correspond to anything. I'm glad the book was free so I can delete this without being out anything."
1,Limericks,"If you are looking for a nonsense limerick, this is the book for you - otherwise, keep looking. I kept looking."
1,"Weird, Uncomprehendable Book","This has to be the dumbest book I've read. It has riddles and rhymes that totally don't make sense. I know I would rather read real poetry and literature, not this. I don't even think that small kids would like this confusing book."
4,The Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear,"He is the best of all writers of nonsense verse. He wrote ""The Owl and the Pussycat ""The Nonsense ABCs"", and numerous limmericks.dwahl"
2,Formatting problems,"The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out. This one was quite disappointing, since the limericks it contains appear as continuous text, so are quite inconvenient to read. It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!"
1,Not really readable,"There are headings for pictures, but no pictures. So half the content is missing from this edition. And, the remaining limericks are just silly."
2,enterence video,"there is no enterence video,no storylines,much lesser wrestlers so its not enjoyable playing mode, so please next time just think about this things so it can be enjoyable while playing on GBA."
3,Alright,"OK its basically the exact same as the first R2WM but theres no entrances here but the graphics r a million times better than the first one. the shopzone is pretty pointless as u cant buy anything just get stuff and look at it but its pretty cool when u first see it though. You get 1/3 less superstars here but u can clearly identify them. u can win titles with title history. the guys available r :rock,hhh,hogan,taker,angle,y2j,rvd,kane,nash,booker t,edge,christian,bubba,dvon and testAnywaysHighly Recommended for Rentyour opinion to buy"
4,super ass fun,"this game is so fun baby. i got it last week. it has better graphics than road to wrestlemania. and kane,undertaker ,the rock are still on there i git it infinity stars."
5,what hard rock is all about,"Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
5,Awesome noise....Metallica deservers thanks for introducing me to this band...,"I decided to buy this album because my good friends Metallica told me they really liked this band. They covered four songs of theirs on their garage, inc. album, so I thought they couldn't be that bad. And Motorhead are awesome! This is wonderful noise, especially the title track (which feels like it can go on forever, which is OK by me), and Stay Clean, which has a great bass solo in it. Lemmy can't really sing, but that's OK, I still dig the crazy vibe this album has. It's also hard to believe this guy are only a trio, as they sound larger than that. Overkill is a perfect introduction to the genius (?) of Motorhead."
4,don't stop!,when i hear this bad nasty music i feel that my ears are being raped. but i can't help myself: i like it. pure musical mayhem. well worth 4 stars.
2,Wrong info,I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. I do love this album from Motorhead though.
3,Sophisticated Halloween suppers for grownups,"This book is perhaps not well named. It is NOT about spooky spectacular Halloween parties. You won't find creative decorating and innovative costume ideas. Rather it is a nice recipe book for adult dinners, fun cocktails, and elegant place settings for a seasonal supper party. It isn't a one-shop top for your Halloween party ideas, but I really like some of their magical spell ideas, and their fun dinner and drink recipes."
2,So much potential.,"This is one of those books that I like the *idea* of, but not so much the execution. It's gotten to the point where if a book has the word ""spooky"" (or a variation) on the cover, I'm just going to assume it's not. The idea - offering ideas for six themed parties - would make for an excellent book if they were all actually Halloween-themed. Sadly, even the Halloween-specific party suggestions fall a little flat."
3,Too Retro,"I'm a huge Halloween fanatic and own quite a few books on the subject and I'm always looking for more with new and fresh ideas. This would be a good book for someone who is into the retro theme as the book seemed like it focused soley on that, but because that's not for me, I was sadly disappointed in this book. But if retro is your thing, it had some nice ideas. Nothing new in the recipe section either."
3,"This is a good book, but...","It was ruined between the last fifteen pages. This particular version of the e-book has some severe editing issues, and the audio book goes spastic around the same time as the faulty organization of the text, leaving reader confused."
3,Haven't read yet,I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read. I will read it on one of my overseas flights.
3,Its okay,"I was intrigued by the movie ""John Carter"" and decided to read all these books, since they were free on my Kindle. I found the first 2 -3 very imaginative and adventurous but then they kind of lost their edge after that. Also got tired because there is very little ""down time"" and mostly action.... not that action is bad, its just nice to get more background and culture and description in there as well. But if you are into Sci-Fi its a must read!"
5,One of the Better Mars Books,"More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord. John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction. Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters."
4,classic,"Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction.Our hero is framed for the abduction of princess Thuvia, so he goes to rescue her and clear his name.It's also a pretty classic romance plot, with the hero and heroine in love with each other, but unsure how the other feels, and societal/political conventions standing in their way. *shhhh... don't tell."
3,Enjoyed story,"I enjoyed this story as much as the other Barsoom books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. However I wouldn't recommend this non illustrated version. The typeface and spacing of the novel in the kindle edition made the book difficult to read. I was constantly tapping the button to go to the next page since there were few words on the page, almost like a children's book. If I would have purchased a different version I would give this book at least 4 stars."
3,Great old book,Readers have to remember the age context of this book and the entire ERB series. All in all I found reading the series very enjoyable. The would have to be extensively up-dated if someone were to try and push them today.
3,"Thoughts on Thuvia, Maid of Mars","I found Thuvia, Maid of Mars to be an enjoyable story. It follows the next generation of characters, who are more fallible but overall less fun than John Carter."
1,not good,I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
4,Love the book.,Awesome book. I've read all of the books in this series. You will not be disappointed. Edgar Rice Burroughs is before his time as an author and I look forward to reading more form him.
2,Old-School Bore Metal,"This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal, with all songs sounding the same. Mid-paced tempos and simplistic solos abound, with moronic wayyyyy-out-of-date pretend-satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Want real thrash metal, aside from the Big Four? Try Coroner, Arch Enemy, Arsis, The Crown, the Haunted, Hypocrisy, and a ton of others that poop all over this album from miles above."
4,so my afternoon continues,"One cannot help but find themselves entranced in the soundscapes the this Chicago group creates. Songs such as, ""Afternoon Speaker"", and the cruising vocals of Sam Prekop bring you back to what I may call, ""a simpler time"", some kind of nostalgia mode. Strange are these vast songs, that seem to span to the horizon, yet remind you how good it feels to use your headphones and keep things all to your self. Like a chapter of a good book, this album keep you rolling upon sand dunes, and finally ending with sand caked to your feet and a good tan, and your afternoon still continuing. An excellent album. (As a side note, the design of the album's case is fantastic)."
3,"Better to go with ""The Biz"" or ""The Fawn""","I was pumped for this album to be released. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The music on this album is characteristically Sea and Cake, very mellow and relaxing. What it lacks, however, compared to ""The Biz"", ""The Fawn"", and ""Nassau"", is some upbeat songs. When I listen to the album, all the songs seem to blend together. The magic behind some of their other albums is taking some rocking stuff and keeping it somehow unintrusive. I would highly suggest buying ""Nassau"" or ""The Biz"" if you've never heard ""The Sea and Cake"" before. I'll still listen to the album, of course!"
4,whoa,"Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to ""all the Photos"" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."
4,Softer subtleties,"On their 5th album, what once seemed like a fun side project was surely coming into its own, as a refined, more intimately arranged group offered what was arguably their sleekest sophistication to date."
5,"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music.....","Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
3,Bon Oui,"Sucked in by an unassuming gem of a record called The Fawn, I continue to listen to new Sea and Cake music though, honestly, the thrill has paled for me (or perhaps it has for the band?). Oui is a fine record. Sam Prekop, leader of Sea and Cake, seems to be working out his desire to be Arto Lindsay fronting Stereolab. Couldn't tell you what he's singing about - his vocals aren't inaudible, though they are whispered, barely projected. He seems disinterested in what he's singing, so why should I care? As long as they keep the tempos jaunty, Oui moves along at a nice clip. When they slow things down, they're deadly."
2,OK,Pretty horrible. Like in WWE women cant wrestle.Expecially harcore wrestling.Sexxxy eddy was the best part of the whole dvd. There is no bonus matches wtf!? It says there are but there isnt its just the tournament. Do not buy! I should have listened to the review but i didnt
5,Tried it and then bought it.,Simple to install and easy to use the software does not eat much memory and works without much intrusion in your daily life and fore that I give it 5 stars.Updates are done often or as often as you wish and take only a very short time to download...try that with other programs of this nature.I would buy again.
1,completely useless - garbage,"at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program... cheap, uses up very minimal resources, simple to use.. lifetime subscription for free.. what could be wrong?EVERYTHING. see, the problem isn't that this program can't find viruses.. the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. that's right, it leaves the viruses right there!! how is that useful in any way? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses, but still the log report would announce to me ""(this many) viruses could not be deleted or cleaned."" well, thanks for nothing. i'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program."
2,Subscription Flawed?,"Bought the 2005 program in the spring. I've been using this program for about 4 months, now the program prompts me to renew my subcription. I can't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription. Other programs give you one year of use before renewing. I'm not certain if this product is working correctly. I'm going to use a different product instead."
1,Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients,"If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that, but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation. I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and couldn't clean or quarantine it! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients. To me this is false advertising!!!"
1,"breaks other programs, can't uninstall","DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. On install the etrust antivirus software (nothing else just antivirus) broke my Zone Alarm firewall, interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up. I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install; they keep popping up with guess what error message? That's right, please uninstall Etrust antivirus software, it is incompatible with our software. I've emailed Etrust and tried thier 'live' online chat and get no response. The software is evil, it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it. I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand. Don't repeat my mistake!!!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply. The reply was to go to their update center and to renew. I sure wasn't going to pay again for something I only had for two months and its suppose to last for a year.I'll be going back to my trusted Norton Antivirus, it may be slow but at least I only have to buy it once a year."
1,Unable to uninstall,"Once my year-long subscription expired, I have been unable to uninstall CA ETrust. It now pops up a nag window about every 20 minutes, and when you click exit, it pops up a browser window and takes you to CA's web page. I have tried uninstalling many different ways to no avail. This has been going on for months and makes my computer painful to use.My attempts to reach support are futile. Their support page doesn't work in my browser (IE 6.0) and the phone line is pay (which I will probably end up paying).This is much worse than a virus. At least with a virus I can go buy Norton and clean things up."
2,"Stoner Rock, I think not!","First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed."
4,Outstanding Rock Album,"Picked up the album after I saw the band play with Clutch and COC - Very cool, mellow rock groove throughout... Kind of a funky COC/Gov't Mule kind of sound to a lot of the songs... Excellent choice for fans of ""stoner rock,"" especially ""Fear Death by Water"" and ""Poor Robert Henry,"" which have a definite old-school southern rock feel to them... Check these guys out, it's worth your while!"
4,A new beginning...,"This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!"
3,Basic Stoner Rock,"If you like the fun genre known as ""stoner rock,"" then you'll like Sixty Watt. They revel in Sabbath riffs, mixed with liberal doses of southern rock. In this case, that's not all bad. ""Fear of Death By Water"" has some cool slide licks and singer Dan Kerzwick's rasp sounds like he just drank a 5th of whiskey. ""Low Earth Orbit"" has a laid back groove and existential lyrics, while ""Roll The Stone"" is pure Skynyrd all the way. As with a lot of bands that play this kind of music, their repetoire is limited and after awhile the songs tend to repeat themselves. This record is a good beginning though."
1,"POOR Quality, stay away!!","One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof."
1,Couldn't use it,"After adjusting the leg pieces for several days (wearing socks & boots)and then even replacing these with foam rolls I still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product, even at a 45degree incline. I know somebody else who has one and they like it so I guess it depends on the person, I am not heavy for my size and never thought this would be an issue."
5,Panasonic 1GB SD Memory Card (133x),"This card was free with my new Panasonic Lumix TZ-3. It came pre-formatted, has plenty of capacity and is certainly fast enough for my needs. I don't shoot movies or multiple-frame sequences very often. All in all, I'm very pleased with it."
2,Does not work with palm easily,Did not work with my Palm T|C right away.I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C.
1,Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item,"Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you."
4,card is actually 66x not 133x,"The product title is incorrect. This card is 10MB/s (up to 66x). That is what it actually says on the box, not 133x. It isn't a problem for me because 66x is plenty fast for my panasonic fx30 camera. But if you really require 133x (i.e. 20MB/s) this is not the card for you."
1,Do not order this part from RitzCamera,I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). Ritzcamera will cheat you. You can find the part they sent me for $20 less on Amazon with free shipping.
5,Received the correct SD card,"Since there is this issue of people getting the wrong card, I just wanted to say Amazon did send the correct card.I have a Nikon Coolpix 5m camera. The card seems to work fast. I have only tried it for a few days."
2,NOT REALLY A LUNCH BOX,"This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price."
1,Overpriced,"I cannot believe the ""discounted"" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3.00 (that's right, $20 less). Search on ""key float""."
3,Gadzooks !,"This is wonderful-awful, but always gadzooksie !A pure 1950s musical with the plus of Yma Sumac,who was hired to periodically yelp into screechy song.OK. I luvit."
3,Maybe I Should Lsten to This One Again,"I can't really say anything in this really did it for me. After reading all about Yma Sumac's incredible range, it was a little disappointing to find that what she did was a remarkable but weird version of humming. Her songs don't actually have lyrics. There are a few nice numbers here, but nothing really stands out in my mind - Here's to Your Illusions is probably the best number and it's pleasant. I'd say the main reason to buy this one is its collectors value, and Barbara Cook. It probably won't be around much in the future."
1,You don't buy this one for the plot or the acting.,What little plot there is is an old one. Aliens send a rep. here to look us over. Only this one is only interested in our sex lives. Plenty of good looking babes. No acting tallent. The music bites.
2,Relaxing viewing time,A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
1,Femalien,For this kind of movie your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. But that's what happened.Only 1 person could act. Most of the women where max 5s. The best part of the movie is the front cover.
3,Good enough not to skip ahead,"There is enough of a plot and the acting is good enough that this movie is watchable, even if it is not just the soft porn that you are looking for."
5,This movie was GREAT if only for the end,Overall the movie had what might be considered a plot but I do have to say the blonde in the movie was simply awesome. The ending blow my mind WOW if anything get the movie just to watch the ending over and over.....
3,hummm,This wasn't what I thought it was more soft core I guess.I watched it 2 times and I guess I got what I paid for.LOL
4,Aliens Study the Sensual Arts,"I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon. As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien. Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions. The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for."
2,Femalien,"The R rated DVD of this movie is not worth the price. It's cut to smithereens. Buy the unrated version, instead."
3,Its Ok,"I got this for the sexual seens I've heard about. Fine women, but its something you couldn't watch more than once or twice. It gets boring after that. Oh...do get the unrated version. I don't see how those guys can stay limp working with those girls."
3,femalien,it is a cinemaxs movie so t&a is a given just dont look for anything deep or good acting just t&a
1,Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!,"Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."
3,"Not bad, though I've seen better","Plenty of skin, lots of silicone, paper thin dialogue, and an overbearing, godawful soundtrack. They could have done a lot better with either decent music or none at all. it won't let me give 2 and a half stars, or I would give it that many, at best. Save your money for a decent porno flick. This one doesn't quite cut it."
3,"My gosh, what a mix of responses!","Understandable, though.-could have been a great spoof, like ""Cannibal Women""-could have been a great erotic adventure...-could have been a mighty declaration of the power of eros..sorry...None of the guys in the film can get it up--this is not good! The gals do ok, but there is a problem.Stop. There is a problem."
2,"Nil Science Fiction, Strong Sexual Content","Because this video in unrated and carries no warning in the information area I feel shoppers should be aware that this by all rights a soft core porn film with strong sexual content and little science fiction. I bought the VHS version from another source expecting the sort of movie ""Roger Corman Presents"" might sponsor, something along the lines of ""Species"" or Amanda & the Alien. While more in the vein of the latter the sci-fi part, {or any other technology for that matter}, is limited to a few teleportations via telekinesis and some aura/emotion melding. The movie is probably 60% by time made of sexual contact. Technically the movie is suprisingly well made for the genera. It is shot on film {not video tape}. The scenery is professionally done and the acting level reaches that of daytime soap operas. The sound quality is not bad. So the technical qualities are there to be transfered to DVD, just beware of the content."
3,Femalien - Pretty Good Title,"FEMALIEN has a pretty decent plot, great looking women and pretty good softcore action. It's mainly about an female alien ""Tara""(Venesa Taylor) who comes to earth to study human sexuality. She observes and participates with both genders of the human species from one on one action to orgies. The lead actress Taylor (Tara) is very attractive and buxom in a ""girl-next-door"" sort of way and comes off very sweet and good-natured. In fact, all the women come off that way in this movie which was the most notable aspect of the female characters. A pretty decent soft adult film fare with a slight plot hovering over all the writhing flesh!!"
4,close encounters of the sexy kind,"As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up."
1,What a waste,"I had the movie before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the ""Flyboys Game"" I thought I would buy it off the market place. Good seller, but the DVD did not come with the game as advertised. It only came with a DEMO version of the game. They should have said that on the box. Thanks a bunch for false advertisement. Thought the other extras might make up for it, WRONG! Don't waste your time or money."
1,pretty awful,"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
4,The story is by no means original - but that doesn't make it bad!!,"If ever there was a war movie designed for a James Dean style actor - this is it! Although ""inspired"" by a true story, there is nothing original in this movie's story line and it's outcome is rather predictable (but then we all know how WWI ended), but even those two criticisms can take nothing away from the action portrayed in this movie. I missed seeing it at the cinemas and having now watched it on DVD, I really wish I had made the effort to have viewed it on the big screen. The scene of French Bi-planes attacking a Zeppelin are awesome, as are all the dog fight scenes of which there are plenty. There were no real disappointments for me in this movie (other than my own failing to see it on the big screen), it is a great watch, one you walk away from thinking - ""man that was pretty good, I'd watch it again!!!"""
3,"3 stars for the visuals, 1 star for the storyline","This may be the only film made in the past twenty years that deals with World War I aerial combat. It's not an easy thing to do since most of those planes are gone now. Enter CGI and some devoted souls tracking down remaining combat planes from the era. The graphics sometimes leave something to be desired, but overall the effect is majestic and exciting.The storyline is all but nonexistent.James Franco seems destined to be an also-ran, which is a shame since he's a fine actor. He just doesn't get to shine that often in his projects.Get this film for the visuals, but don't get too excited about the plot..."
1,completely disappointing,"I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This cliché-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."
1,Terrible - I walked out of this movie,"When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype."
4,Better than I was led to believe,"The critics don't like it for the most part, but I really had a good time. Flyboys won't win any awards, but it sure entertained my packed theater. People laughed at most of the little jokes scattered throughout this long film. Clocking in at over two hours it is a bit too long and some of the dialogue is lacking, but the romance is handled well (unlike Pearl Harbor, thank God!), as are the many amazing CGI dogfight scenes. If your bored one afternoon, you should check out Flyboys, otherwise just wait for the DVD."
2,Another computer generated teen brain flick,The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can't watch this thing....You can not fly next to each other and yell back and forth between aircraft... They had hand signals for that... the story line is far from historical... I guess is Ok as a highschool date movie...
4,A good DVD movie,"It's not Oscar time for this film, but it was diverting. I thought it did give a good overview of the Escadrille and the motivations of the characters who came from the US to volunteer. True, the terrors of war weren't driven home as in Saving Private Ryan, but this just isn't that kind of movie. Fortunately, as it was my 9-year-old son's interest in WWI planes that motivated the purchase. He was able to watch it without too many disturbing scenes (although the scene in the trenches was pretty intense). If you're looking for intense, gripping action and emotional turmoil, along with Titanic-level accuracy, this isn't the one for you. But for a family movie I thought it was pretty good."
1,Is There A Cliche That Wasn't Used?,"This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
2,Ho Hum Effort,"Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
3,"The aerial battles were good, but...","This movie didn't work for me. Some of the battles were very good. The battle with the Zeppelin was especially exciting. However, the love story slowed the story down. Since they didn't speak the same language, it was almost painful to hear them communicate. He was in France for months. Surounded by French speakers and he didn't pick up more than a few phrases of French? He joined a French military unit, wouldn't he be rather motivated to learn the language? The air battles work, but they almost go into video game mode at times. The characters were a tad boring, no depth."
3,"A bit too long, but still a fun movie.","From this two hour and twenty mintue movie about forty mintues should have been edited out. I wanted to see this film because I wanted to see a bunch of dogfights and planes being shot down. And it does deliver that....very well, too! But the director spent way too much time focusing on the drama of the time and Cassidy's romance with a French girl. The special effects and action are what make this movie worth watching. But the bordome that must be endured between dogfights prevents this movie from reaching its full action movie potential.Ups: Cool cinematography, fun action scenes and good special effectsDowns: Plenty of action movie clichés and long, boring sequences"
5,Flyboys [ Blu-Ray ],"The disc was send in fast time,and made it in perfect shape.Info was great between Amazon and me,Thanks for a great job well done."
1,Thank God for fast forward,"I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
1,Flyboys,"Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film."
3,Flyboys was disappointing !!!,"I was somewhat disapppointed with Flyboys. The movements of the WWI planeswere unrealistic. The motion of the vintage planes in dogfights was farmore than their capabilities would allow. We sent it to our WWII hero inNew Zealand,that is our friend,& he rated it average."
3,Flyboys,"The story was good, but not riveting. Sort of canned story line. Action was very good and the flying scenes were pretty believable. I did not have much interest in the connected love story. I realize most pilots have a private life but that was not my interest. I am an airplane nut so that is why I wanted to see it. To see the planes for accuracy and flying scenes.Overall the film was good. Certainly not great."
3,Good Enough,"I had to watch this video for an American History project for my school. I admit it took me two nights because the first night did not hold my interest well enough. When I finally finished it, I admit to being surprised. I did very much enjoy this movie. It's nice to not have the top-of-the-line actors doing all the performances. It was also nice that it was done in a fashion that would allow these events to have actually taken place and happened. It did not rush them like they would in the, oh say, James Bond movies, but allowed a more natural time scope. Some of the comments call it slow, and yes, it is slow, but it's a natural slowness which is nice to see in a movie. It is tempting to add this to my collection of DVD's...I reccomend it to any parent or student who is studying, or helping study, the WWI era."
4,Flyboys made my day.,"Unlike the technical experts who hate the score, criticize the presence of red Fokker Triplanes, condemn the physics of the aerial battles, and not to mention, the quality of the acting, I enjoyed every minute of this film. But then, I like airplanes, and I like it when the good guys are good guys. The story line was interesting throughout. The acting was just fine - thank you, and the special effects were great. I recommend this film for all except the nitpickers mentioned above."
4,"Very good, trust me","I was expecting Flyboys to tank. And it didnt. The movie could have had some help at the box office if it had a different name (Flyboys sounds dumb to me) and more advertising leading up to its release. When viewing the movie you cant find fault with the acting. Everyone does a good job. The plot and writing arent perfect but get the point across. The bond between the men as they battle together works well. The romance though is the key here for me. We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love. Its the heart of the movie in my opinion. The action is great, though I could argue that the dogfighting is too short. You just get the blood pumping and that particular fight ends too soon. The battles could have been longer but they are well executed. Very good movie!!!"
4,"Fun Movie, Bad History","This was a really fun movie to watch but it they took an awefull lot of creative liscense. The combat scenes were fun but looked so fake. If you were to dive as steeply as they did in that film for as long as they did in a Nieuport 17 you would rip the lower wing clean off. Probably the same with the Fokkers. If you want more realistic combat scenes I would recomend The Blue Max but this movie will still keep you on the edge of your seat. One think I didn't like was the fact that they made the Germans look really bad. I've read many accounts of German pilots who really went out of their way to be humane and a many stories of allied pilots who were downright cruel (Mannock). WWI was a war where niether side was better than the other, and it was a war that shouldn't have happened. Entangling alliances are an itch."
1,Flyboys! Don't think so,"Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste...."
2,Should been better,"Nice actions, but if you looking for a more authentic WWI aerial combat drama try ""Der Rote Baron"" instead."
3,Flying solo.,"Flyboys starring James Franco kept my attention, great special effects and moving story from beginning to end. Martin Henderson also stars. This film is set against the turblent time of World War I. Parts of this film are a bit dragged out and I wish this movie was cut down to two hours but Flyboys will impress you frame by frame, enjoy!"
4,"""Wings"" was the first WW I dog fight movie in 1927","There is a long tradition of these movies; Howard Hughes even made one.This movies has some very good aerial shots.The acting is also pretty good. I think this may be a remake ofan older film, but it is in full color.The glamor of the war was in the air with the Red Baron.There were real Americans that actually fought here.WW I was the first of the real dehumanizing warswith the trench lines and poison gas. The fighter pilotsgave a new ""knight"" like quality to war in the air."
4,Flyboys,"Fantastic special effects! Makes one think they're actually in the air. Period uniforms, period aircraft, and good scenery. The love story part was a bit hokey, but all in all I liked this movie."
4,Good for 10th grade world history,"I know this movie has a lot of historical inaccuracies and a lot of cliches but it is fun for my 10th grade students. I use it to teach how hollywood glorifies history and rewrites it for the sake of entertainment. And 10th grade students understand cliches. After all, I would not be able to show them All Quiet on the Western Front or Joyeux Noel. They would fall asleep. I don't even have to censor part of the movie! The movie is good for them."
4,Flyboys at the top,The movie as other reviewers have commented provides the viewer with a realistic and near historically correct account of early fighter plane and pilot experiences in the WW1. The dogfight and bombing scenes are spectacular and convey the perils of early fighter plane flying. The touch of romanticism is subtle and makes the picture more appealing to a wider audience who might be put off thinking it is just a war movie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and would actualy give it 4.5 stars.
3,Graphics are great,As a WWI aviation historian I was delighted to see a 21st century movie about aviation of this era. The acting and dialog was laughable to the point I turned the sound off. Although the accuracy of the few WW1 types of aircraft was spectacular the amount of them was far off the course of reality. This film would be excellent for using as back round flavor for a veteran pilot reunion.
1,"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting....","Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
1,A $1 rental,"The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected."
3,In the middle,"This seems to be one of those love or hate it pictures. I will start with the good. The historical accuracy is very good. The air battles are excellent. It is nice to finally have a movie covering WWI a little. The bad is the bland lead actor, the terrible cliches(white guy doesn't like black guy until the life saving event, then changes his heart. The lead who learns to work with others, etc.) Seen those in a million pictures. So overall, it is a well shot movie with a story worth seeing, but a lack of strong acting and compelling script bring this one down."
5,Movie fan,Excellent documentary drama. If you enjoy history you will love this! Would have liked the happy ever after ending though.
3,war movie,Its a good movie to watch when you are in the mood for a war movie it kinda tells the story
5,Excellent dogfight,"While the story drifts at times, it is still an entertaining movie with great dogfight scenes. Makes you wonder what early fighter pilots went through."
4,Great Blu ray! Exciting flying sequences,"I have watched this movie 3 times. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only complaint I have is the fact that the german tri planes are almost all red. Which is totally inaccurate. The only plane that was red in reality, was the Red Baron. Who was not even in this movie, otherwise all the americans would be dead. roflol:)Seriously though, the fighting sequences are great to watch, especially when you see the bullets flying through the air. If they would come out with more movies like this one, with the same technology, that would be great. Maybe less romance, and more flying action. the flying sequences were too short in my opinion. Worth buying and enjoyable!!"
4,Quite an expierence,This really is a must see blue ray disc. I read a lot of reviews before getting and must say I see what all the excitement was about. Watching this movie on blue ray is a treat in itself. The movie was okay but the specail effects and photography really made it an exciting expierence.
1,Painfully fake,"For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
1,A truly bad movie,Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
4,Flyboys,"I enjoyed this DVD and the suplemental DVD as well. I give this film four stars because of the great computer graphics and the clean plot. The reality factor was taken a little too far concerning the aircraft abilities/ capabilities of that time era. Still...the film was enjoyable. I can't help but wish that they developed the characters more. I guess there are time restraints and such to consider. Anyway, a fun movie to relax with and eat pop corn with your family! Sure beats watching yet another ho hum flesh eatting zombie spin off that seems to always be showing up(smile)!"
3,"Entertaining, but disappointing for aviation buffs","Entertaining enough film but the CGI flying scenes never lose that computer game look. WW1 planes only flew at a maximum speed of about 115 mph yet in this film they flit about like something from Star Wars. If you want a reality check on what movie makers could deliver for a WW1 aviation movie - 30 years ago - just compare this film with "" The Blue Max"" or "" Aces High""."
5,Great Movie,"I went to see this in the theater with tempered expectations based on the ""average"" reviews the movie received from the critics. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great movie about a subject and period that is largely ignored by Hollywood."
4,Visually Stunning,"I loved the Movie, it has everyting Great direction, Stunning visuals, Good looking cast, Great locations, Superb arieal fight scenes, Awesome Blu Ray picture & sound quality..Other than some great action, it covers Romance, Friendships & some more..pssst now thats for you to watch & find out!!"
1,Be Forwarned!!!,"I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like."
2,"Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else","This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
3,Entertaining but disappointing,"I'm sorry to say that I don't share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers for this film. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't that great either. I agree that the fight scenes were very well done and exciting to watch, but other than that, I was very disappointed. I found the acting to be mediocre and the tone of the film was somewhat cheesy, I thought. I was expecting a serious war film in the category of 'Saving Private Ryan', but what I witnessed was more similar to Jerry Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbor.' It is more of a ""feel-good"" war movie, than a realistic one. Don't get me wrong, the film had it's moments, but it just wasn't what I expected. So if you just want to be entertained for a couple hours, I could think of plenty of worse movies, but if you're expecting an epic war film, 'Flyboys' is not it."
4,WW1 Esquadrille Squadron,"This is an excellent movie about a little known piece of history, wherein a group of American volunteers traveled to France to learn to fly and assist the French in their effort against German aircraft. There are several encounters with the German Ace, the Red Baron, who had shot down something like 80 allied planes.The movie is well done and the air action is exciting."
1,"Sheesh, pull kids away from the radio!","I don't own this, which is surprising because I love to ""discover"" new acts. You want to know why I didn't buy this? I don't think they should even be allowed to sell this garbage! ""When I get you all alone, I'm gonna take off all your clothes, ain't nobody gonna interupt my game."" I couldn't believe that a song like that could make it onto the airwaves. I know you'll make fun of ""Genie In A Bottle,"" but I don't care, it's innocent and cute when a girl does it. When a guy sings stuff like this, I want to throw a rock at 'em!"
3,"Faded = SWEET, the rest are just OK","I bought soulDecision's cd because I absolutely loved the single ""Faded."" The beat of that song makes me DANCE and I don't equate it to other boy bands' songs. Frankly, the rest of the cd disappointed me a bit, but I didn't expect too much when I bought it. I am impressed with the fact that the guys all play their own instruments, but I must admit that the album far from blew me off my feet. I hope that soulDecision produces more singles as quality as ""Faded"" - the lead singer Trevor is a hottttie too, I saw them in concert in Seattle. Nice."
3,Not quite what I expected,"From the Canadian music channel Much Music I saw the videos of Faded and Ooh It's Kinda Crazy, and thought that the group had a cool sound. Although a few of the songs are along the same lines of those 2 (ex. #10 Gravity) some of them definitely have too much of a boy-band feel for my tastes. I think the reason for this is that it's their debut CD and they want to see what people like, so they put a lot of different songs and wait for people's reaction to them. By the next CD they should have a definite sound. So chances are you're not gonna like every song on this CD."
5,Missionary Pal Reference Guide for Missionaries and Teachers,"I've wanted this book for a gift. It's in excelent shape except for a dedication in side front cover, It alteady arrived today, which made me happier. This is ""Missionary Pal for Missionaries and Teachers"". 1/11/13."
5,book purchase,"Book was recieved fast and in great shape, I needed this fast so I could send it to my son in China that is serving a mission and it came in time to send it with his Christmas package. thank you for your service"
2,Bias Shows Through,"While this book is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. If this book were to be shared with people of non-Mormon faiths, they would become very defensive and rightly so. The author's invective toward the Catholic faith is appaling. Many Mission Presidents do not recommend this book. It could be dangerous in the hands of the untrained."
2,"THESE COME AS ONE PAIR, & NOT 3 PAIRS AS PICTURED!!","I'm sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed...my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price. I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and ""false advertising"", as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price. Hope I enjoy the socks, but thought I'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you'll receive."
5,New favorites!,"These socks are my husband's new favorites. And he has tried LOTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS of socks. He used to wear the Gold Toe Windsor Wool OTC for many years, which were beautifully made and stayed up and came in 4 colors. Gold Toe changed them more and more so they became so tight that they'd leave marks/indentations on his legs. My husband bought numerous different Gold Toe styles and finally loves these. They only come in black and navy, so he is wearing only the black for now and uses old brown, navy, or gray ones when he needs those colors.These are very soft and stretchy but durable feeling. They stay up and do not make your feet sweat like many fabrics do. For the time being this is the new favorite at our house. (Gold Toe, PLEASE make more colors!!!) Two thumbs and 10 toes up!"
2,they have taken a step back,"i was also excited about buying this game only to find out that the people at visual concepts had taken a big step back. i was a fan of the series on dreamcast and had easily handed it the best basketball game of 2000 - 2002. well i purchased this game 4 days ago and haven't found a way to play more than 10 minutes total. to me the graphics look no better on gamecube than it did on dreamcast. second of all the gameplay ... the dunks look worse, the post play is horrible and the high lob passes will drive you crazy...the menus are confusing also. i don't think nba live 2003 is the answer but this game doesn't do it for me either. play 2k2 and save your money."
4,This game rocks!,"Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!"
4,CHANGE OF HEART,"i wrote a review of this game a couple of months ago and after starting to play this game again have changed my mind. i thought before it was slow and the passes were too balloon like. but i have started playing the game on fast mode which i believe brings the game up to regular speed and brings back some of the fast break points. fast mode doesn't make it like nba live, it just makes it regular nba speed. this game is very real. just watch the passes and watch how the computer plays at times (penetrating and dishing out). although the computer doesn't know how to handle a zone (jacking up three point shot with whoever is at the top of the key). the only thing to watch out for is the game freeze on franchise mode. this will drive you crazy"
4,BEST NBA GAME KILLS EA HIPPED GAME,HOOP fans all over the globe ditch the stupid nba live to go to a better game I like to call NBA2k3. Brings realness and dunks that make you want to scream. This game is so good it will make your pants fall off. Good modes. Graphics 8out of 10. Gameplay 10 out of 10. Realness 10-10. Not perfect but as close as its going to get till next year.
5,an excellent tune,"Here they are again! German deejay and producer Yanou and the Dutch goddess Do(minique). If you liked Heaven, you will love this song even more! Radio edit is a nice trance tune. Extended version is even more powerfull. Piano version is a nice ballad. Even your mom will like it! Dj's@work remix is the best version, and the Flashrider remix is the least commercial version of this tune. My favorite remix is Flashrider meets Yanou remix. Buy it! (Unfortunately, there is no enhanced video. It is an interesing story about the dancer (Do) and her admirer (Yanou).)Yanou and Do, please be here for us!ON & ON!"
2,Dry and Humorless,"I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."
4,VERY HARD!!!,"This game is fun, but VERY hard! I had a very tough time getting all the 10 red gears on the 1st level. However, I got 5 out of the 10 red gears. Not bad, huh? If you are a hardcore videogame player, buy this, or if you aren't a hardcore videogame player, buy this and just play for fun."
4,Worthy of the name HotWheels.,"Okay here's the deal there's a one player mode and a multiplayer mode. In one player you can either play Adventure mode which is the story. or you can play Chalenge mode which is simmilar exept no story and you can unlock more. There's also practice races and battles as well as JoyRide wich is free roming. IN multiplayer you can either battle or race. There's many cars too. Plus alot of cool weapons, like sonic boom, or ZapperCannon.This is an overall good game, but don't expect it to blow you away."
5,Exceptionally helpful to someone in their first year,"I found this book to be very comprehensive: addressing what MS is, what causes MS, symptoms of MS, diagnosis, symptom management, treatment options, and social aspects. It includes the technical description, but through the use of analogies, makes each description very tangible for the layperson. I found the section on medications (and their evolution) particularly helpful. This book reinforced much of what I've learned through doctors, websites, and support organizations and filled in the gaps where information was lacking. It's an excellent resource for someone who has been newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis."
3,"Great music, but...","Emile Waldteufel is the ""other"" Waltz king, and the complete set (of which this is only one disk) is a joy to own. The music is beautiful and more lush than Strauss, and the Slovak National Orchestra does a creditable, if not outstanding, job on the performance. It truly is wonderful listening and dancing music. If I were rating this disk on the basis of the music and orchestral performance alone it would receive 5 stars.Unfortunately, this reissue via Naxos lacks important characteristics of the original Marco Polo production. If you, like I, transfer your music to computer and play it through an MP3 player, then this disk will disappoint you because it contains nothing but music. The original liner notes were not reproduced on the CD case, nor was there any metadata attached. I had to input all the information by hand.Because of this, the disk gets downgraded to 3 stars. Lacking the metadata, it's just not up to my expected standard for good classical music."
5,"Not really a review, sorry","I do not own this book, and am not reviewing it. But there is a quote from the essay ""On Living In An Atomic Age"" that is going around once again, following the London bombings of July 2005. I am putting it here on Amazon so interested parties Googling to find the source of the quote might have an easier time of it:""If we are . . . going to be destroyed by [a] bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things--praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts--not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.""--C.S. Lewis"
4,Compelling and Disturbing Read,"""Mom Kills Kids and Self"" was an unassuming book I saw on the library shelf. Intrigues by the title, I picked it up and opened the cover. The book sucked me in with the first few pages. Our main character, never named, has returned home to find his wife has killed herself after murdering their two sons. What unfolds afterwards is looking through the eyes of a man driven to insanity by this act. His behavior and actions are strange and unexpected as his thoughts fantically trace back through time, trying to find the cause of his family's death. Everything in this story is juxtasposed, from his perspective on his wife's life, his boy's lives, and from his own life, from his work, aand from his philosophy on women. The story kept me captivated, I recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a combination of King and Vonnegut."
1,Saperstein is a no talent,He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
5,Maturity in his writing,After reading his earlyworks you can see how Chandler used his previous stories and ideas to develop these incredible novels featuring his most famous detective Philip Marlowe.
3,NOOOOOOO!,I really wanted to like this film. I waited and watched for it so I could see it but the clips on youtubewere the only thing that were good. Then at the end I am waiting to see how this ends and then it says to be continued. It took forever to see this first film now I have to wait to see another. The premise of the movie was great but overall it was kind of a dud.
2,Long drawn out...all over the place!!!!,I saw this movie at the UMFF. It was toooo long. It was into 67 mins and still haven't got to the point. The storylines ...well so are all over the place. I would recommend putting on this movie if you have insomia. Trust me it will put you to sleep
4,Sorry Wendy,"I would have given this album a 5 had I not heard Zero first, but then nothing beats a live performanceBB"
3,Lacking something...,"I love this series, I really do. But the second and the third books of this series, in my mind, have steadily declined. Maybe I was too much involved with Kate and Marak's story to want anything else. But I feel that the writing is less impacting. I haven't read such a good teen fiction fantasy series in a while. In the first book, the story was captivating and it drew you in, and a major plus, the characters didn't say stupid things, and romance and kissing wasn't a deluge in the book to add something interesting. But I just didn't feel that way with the subsequent books. Mind you, this book can stand on it's own, but I've placed the first book on a pedestal."
4,HIP HIP HUZZAH !!!,"Superb and superb again! Jake Scott has not made a documentary, he has taken us for a look into the 18th century, and has slapped us against the lens of Hogarth to do it. Anachronisms? Yes! They illustrate for him, he has laid them in our path like beacons, they aren't mistakes! We are all awash with them, they have to be made into tools; I know this, having been an 18th century re-enactor for many years. Plunkett and Macleane shimmers and stinks, is glorious and gory. The genius here is not just that he takes the viewer with him into Hogarth's land, it is that he leaves us there."
5,New and Brilliant,"This film is exactly as it says on the box, ""A historic lock, stock and two smoking barrels""! I sat down to watch this film with an open mind as to wether I'd like it or not as it is different to anything i've ever watched before but as soon as the movie started I was mesmerised by the excellent acting, complex,yet easy to follow storyline and excellent soundtrack! Carlyle and Miller both never fail to (Stand and)deliverand Liv tyler as support is also excellent. If you like LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS you're bound to like this!"
2,"""The Velvet Goldmine"" with wigs and panniers","The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad. Pretty costumes, pretty direction, a nifty techno soundtrack, and Robert Carlyle make watching Plunkett & McLeane worthwhile only if you're in the mood for a ninety-minute music video. Brainless fun."
3,a good film...,"that was ruined by its sound track. It's sad really, I almost would have really liked it. I may have been inclined to give it five stars if the sound track hadn't totally destroyed it."
2,Pretentious and Predictable,"There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair."
1,One of the worst movies EVER !!!!,"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film."
4,18th C meets 20th C meets Alan Cummings in make up?,"Starting in a dingy English drunk pen, you may easily mistake this for an every day, run-of-the mill medieval type yarn. However you'd be very much mistaken. 18th century scenery give way to 20th century language (Hence the 15 certificate). A fast paced plot bring together Plunkett (Carlyle) an ex-apothecarist and violent type, with Macleane, a pauper who desperately wants to be a gentleman. Together they create a crime wave, 'robbing from the rich and that's it' An all round gem of a film, with several notable stand alone scenes, foremost of which is the dance scene. Incredible outfits in a beautiful 18th century ballroom to the sounds of drum, bass and keyboard. Truly a unique turn on what could easily have been another tired old ball. All actors put on sterling performances both the 'good guys' and the 'baddies'. Great script, superb costumes, a marvellous film."
4,A completely pleasent surprise,"This is probably my selection for the sleeper movie of 1999. I went past the movie in the video store and saw that Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, Ravenous, The Full Monty) was in the movie and decided to take a chance.I would probably give a 4 1/2 to this if it were possible, everything was done well, acting, directing and especially writing, which is very often lacking in movies these days.The out of place piece of the movie was the language, which was often completely modern, used effectively for humor, especially the modern swearing.Plunkett is a highwayman who loses his partner to the bad guy (Chance, played by Ken Stott) and hooks up with Macleane, who has connections in high culture (i.e. money). They go on a crime spree and become well known. Chance makes it a personal point of honor to catch them.The action was good, the characters were superb, the villan was evil and mean. What more can I say? It is well worth your time."
5,The finest!,"Novak is another of my all time favorites. I have all of his recorded orchestral music, which is my passion. I thought, this one won't hold up to my favorites, In the Tatras and the Eternal Longing. Wrong. They do hold up, they are as beautiful as all of his other compositions. Creative, inventive, runs the full gamut of emotions from tiny delicate passages, to the full beautiful storm. Don't miss this composer!"
5,Brownie,"""Brownie"" was a true genius. Although he died in 1950 at age 25, he was one of the fathers of hard bop. He could play the fastest bebop tune with ease, he was also adept at the ballad, i.e., ""You Go to My Head."" He was also an accomplished composer, i.e. Daahoud"" & Sandu.Brownie was taken from us muchy too early. No, he was not into the Parker influenced drug scene; he died in an auto accident.I guess my favorite tune he wrote was ""Joy7 Spring"" & he plays it on this album.If you're into jazz at all, get some of his albums. The ever present Max Roach was always with him, & on this one Sonny Rollins has a lot to say. The interplay between them is fascinating."
4,Well Worth Having,"This book is a really nice reference book for the backyard birdfeeder. It's not just a bird identifier book, it has chapters on bird survival and behavior. I'm glad to have it my small bird library and refer to it often."
5,"Beautiful Photos, Great Info","I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers."
5,Old Time Favorite,This purchase was made as a replacement for a copy that was ruined when it got wet. Exactly what I wanted.
4,funky and fun,"I saw the Teddybears perform live at Coachella '07 and had such a fantastic time that I bought their album. Their music is lively, fun, interesting and great to dance, run or do anything active to. Very entertaining."
5,Outstanding trilogy,"The notion of three different books by three different authors about the same story, each from a different character's perspective is new to me. I'd enjoyed the Diary series, and thought it was worth picking up the three books just to see how well the concept worked.I actually thought the books by the other two authors were better than this, but only by a small margin. They are all excellent, and reading the same story three different times never got boring because they are all so different, while remaining consistent.In many ways it's so true of life - we really don't know what's going on in other people's heads, especially when it comes to subterfuge and illicit behavior.Three different authors, three different characters, three different styles, one terrific story."
4,Very Different From Jaffe's Usual,"The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book."
3,Urban Legend in Brazil,"This was a decent movie, but why was it advertised as a horror movie? This would fall under the catagory of ""Mad Scientist"" movie. This movie could have been set anywhere in the world.This movie was advertised as if the vacationers would run into a monster in a foriegn country. From that viewpoint , I was disapointed. But for sheer intertainment, it was pretty good, except for the fact that, as I keep repeating, you cannot have most of the action appear without some form of lighting. If we cannot see what is going on, it takes away from the movie. To be honest, if not for Josh Duhmal, this would have been a great ""movie of the week"".His ""rising star"" status lifted the movie to major motion picture status.Had I known this wasn't a horror movie, I would not have bought it. Great to rent; not a great buy."
3,"Was exciting at some points, but became dull and predictable","The acting was good but the storyline was vague and boring as it concluded. I liked some areas of the film which caught my interest but it wasn't long before I just didn't care anymore. I don't recommend this movie for many, but for an OKAY thriller on movie night, maybe."
3,Ending lacked,"The movie was decent, good plot, good characters. The action lacked it was short. The ending also sucked."
1,Not a great movie!,I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
3,"3 Stars, is about right.","Im glad that the average rating for this movie is 3 Stars, because i think that is what it deserves. I Bought this with high hopes, but i was let down. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but i had a MAJOR problem with it. It would have been a 5 Star, if it wasn't for the Lighting. The last 30 - 45 minutes, was completely black. Almost, All that they had to do, was add some extra light. But besides that, it was a really good film.I wish that they would have corrected the lighting, so it could have been 5 star. I have seen NO BUDGET movies with better lighting than this. Acting was Great, LOTS of Blood && Gore, And the Characters were very likable."
2,Humbug!,"This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Not my sort of thing, so I probably never should have bought it in the first place."
3,Brazilian Nightmare,"This movie portrays my country as a savage,Neanderthalesque,lawless,lewd and corrupt destination.It missed only the pigmees,canibals and their drums...The only good thing from that movie are the bikini-clad girls,very hot.It was a pity that a Brazilian doctor with a SPANISH surname had the rather odd urge to kill them.I don't know any case in which a tourist had its organs removed.The local thieves,kidnappers and rapists don't do such thing.Here,you'll just gonna be robbed if you're with your camera,watch or jewelry.Your kidneys are quite safe."
4,Better than Hostel !! Check it out !,"Surely, Hostel pushes gore into new level. But to be honest I think Turistas is slightly more realistic than Hostel. A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.If you like Hostel, this one is no brainer but even if you don't like Hostel, you may still like this one as this is better than HOSTEL."
4,better than hostel,"I liked this movie better than Hostel. This movie has great scenery in the amazonian jungle plus a A plus underwater chase scenes. There's only one gory kinda disturbing death scene. Even though the main characters are one dimensional, you could relate and identify with each character so you cared for the person who dies. In hostel, I didn't care and i feel asleep in the theatres when i saw Hostel. I really didn't believe any of the characters in Hostel. What are the chances of seeing a Hispanic guy whose best friends are two white americans that go on a trip to Europe. Give me a break. Because most hispanic people don't have white americans as best friends. Come on! There's still a lot of racism and this is polite society. People are racist behind closed doors. I find Turistas much more believable than Hostel."
2,getting tired of the cliche,"Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn't help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened. Hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen, and the next thing you know, someone has dropped. It is okay to see it for free, but not worth it when you pay for the ticket."
2,Um....Hostel anyone?,"This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such. I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel. This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares. This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick. The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable. I'm sorry I wasted my time."
1,horrible,"this movie was just plain bad. bad story. bad ""gore"". bad everything. don't waste your money or your time watching this."
2,Low Budget,"Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans."
4,A good movie but not a horror film,"If you're going to buy ""Turistas"" expecting to see a Hostel"" Eli Roth"" type film ...Your not going to,What you will see is a good, well acted, action packed movie with pretty people, beautiful scenery and some blood ""not much"" but the premise is not Horror it's more like the vacation from hell.Over all I liked this movie and recommend it for someone not looking for a hard core horror or gore film but just a good suspenseful action movie."
1,Um...NO.,"Ok I hate to burst anyone's bubble about this movie...but it says on the cover ""A better and scarier movie than Hostel"". Um...NO. I actually enjoyed it up to the point where they got into the house and it got dark. From that point on the movie took place in nothing but darkness and you could not tell what was happeneing or who was who. So so annoying. This movie pissed me off. Don't waste your money. Thank god I only paid a few bucks for it. A complete waste of time. Eww."
1,"Great movie, horrible DVD!","Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film."
4,""" I PLAY FOR THE ALLEGHENY BADGERS ""","A very enjoyable and coming-of-age hockey story about persistance, drive and a will to win. It does involve a bunch of losers who turn into a bunch of winners, but it is done the right way: with entertaining flashbacks of past successes and failures, complemented by hard work and kids having fun where hockey is the topic of conversation, 24 hours a day. In my opinion, it is the roughest and most talent demanding sport in today's society, but also the least publicized and most enjoyable. A group of kids can do something right if they really want to and are willing to give it 110. Not only is this fun to watch, it sends a positive message out to all. Not to mention, a cameo from Mike Modano. A few years after this flick, an NHL expansion team joined the NHL the ""Mighty Ducks of Anaheim"". Coincidence, NO!"
2,How STUPED can you GET!,"I'll tell you how stuped you can get, this movie is how stuped you can get. This is one of the STUPEDEST movie I have ever seen and trust me I've seen alot of movies.The whole movie is dumb exspecailly the actors.I recamend you not see this movie actshoally I more than recamend you I BEG you not to see this movie But if you incest to I recamend you borrow it from a friend your if you can't, rent it at the cheapest place you no before wasting your money on buying it. But if I were you I won't wast my money at all."
2,The Movie That Spawned An NHL Franchise,"Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid's flicks. Well, it was good for what it was. I wouldn't watch it again though, it wasn't as memorable as ""The Sandlot"" or ""Goonies"" but it'll do."
4,Hockey! We love Hockey!,"This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie. If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!"
4,A Film From My Childhood,"I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me. I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it. The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment. Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey. When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there. This film is a laugh a minute with childish humour that still makes me laugh now"
2,uhmmm,I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.
3,Good sale,"My daughter, who is over 21, ordered this video in English. When it arrived it was in Spanish so had to be returned. I don't know for sure who is at fault here, but all is well as we got a speedy refund. Will try to reorder again."
3,Solid 3 stars,"Not Bad for a young man in his 20's truly illustrating what his mind is on right now in his life, a**. I like his vocals and I agree with the comparison to Ralph Tresvant who happens to be one of my favorite members of New Edition and I know that his voice was instrumental in defining the sound for the group. As Ray matures it will be interesting to see how the content of his projects mature. My favorites are What I Need, One Wish, Blue High Heels, Melody and War is Over. Keep Strivin............"
3,It's Okay,"Ray J is an average R&B/hip hop singer. This CD didn't have much to give. Top 3: One Wish, Keep Sweating,Intro"
1,What's this?...,"When i first heard his single ""One Wish"" i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing."
1,If I had one wish...,"Amazon would allow us to vote using negative stars. While we're on the subject of radiation, maybe chemotherapy would be less painful and traumatic then listening to this garbage."
3,Aight!!!,"I heard the CD from my friend. The Cd is ok, i wouldn't buy it myself though. Of course ""One Wish"" is the best song on there. Ray J can't sing to me so maybe that's why the CD isn't that good to me."
1,If i had one wish...,"I'd make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. ""If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish..."". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song."
2,Pure Rated Garbage.(PRG),"THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
4,Raydiation,I too am glad he gave up rapping b/c that was a lost cause. Raydiation has solid HoT tracks. Ray J has my respect. This cd is NOT bad. This album has shown that he has grown as a artist from being Brandy's younger brother. Gotta Much Luv for these songs: 3) What I Need 4) One Wish 5)Playing house 7)Melody...kinda sexy Exotic Unbelieveable...hot beat Sexy.... would have been better w/out Mya.
2,raydiation,"Thank God he stopped rapping, but now this album sucks too! Glad it was free. He's reppin' Cali too- oh hell no! The crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like R. Kelly and Timberland and they did him wrong! There are only three tight songs numbers 3, 4 and 5, all were produced by Rodney Jerkins, he can't be his sister though, this album proves Ray J just ain't got it, maybe he could if he had just stuck with using Rodney Jerkins. But the beats are not supposed to make you tight, your supposed to make that beat what it is and more."
3,MAYBE NEXT TIME...,"Ray J's album is certainly not what was expected and I guess that's why record sales aren't as high as expected. The tracks lack originality and creativity and usually the solution to that problem is a new producer and/or songwriter, which is definitely needed here, Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins sounds have become a bit redundant and a slightly unimpressive. However, the ballads are unforgettable and Ray J really shines on tracks such as ""One Wish"" ""Melody"" ""Anytime"" and ""Centerview"" but I think if he hooked up with a new producer his career would soar, somebody like Babyface or a songwriter like Diane Warren (Brandy's ""Have You Ever?"") who specializes in ballads and that's what Ray J's best at. On the plus side though, the album thankfully doesn't have any silly skits just track after track, but it's an okay album, I just recommend that you buy it when it goes on sale."
3,BALLADS ON THIS CD ARE BETTER,I HAVE RAY J'S FIRST CD I ENJOYED THE BALLADS HIS BALLADS ON THE NEW CD ARE DIFFERENT DOES TAKE GETTING USED TO BUT I DID ENJOY THEM I HAVE ALREADY ADDED SOME SONGS TO MY IPOD HE CAN GO A LONG WAY HE NEEDS TO BE WITH A GOOD PRODUCER MAYBE BABYFACE SOMEONE THAT WILL MAKE WORK HARDER MAKE HIM USE HIS VOICE MORE BUT OER ALL CD IS NOT ALL BAD
4,WELL DONE RAY J.,"This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J."
3,"if I had one wish, i'd never let him come back","In 2000, ""wait a minute"" feat. Lil' Kim was GOOD. I loved that song. Now, He comes back with this crap album. number one, he has too many people featured on his cd. Two, his voice is cracked.""one Wish"" was terrible. I had to leave the room. His voice is very whiny and I felt bad for him. If he went one octave lower, the song would sound much betterHe's now on ""one on one"" which is ok but his acting is not any better.RayJ was better 5 years ago. Now, he just happened to pop back up."
1,Noise Pollution,"Every time I hear that song ""One Wish"" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD."
2,Not worth it,"And I only paid $23 for it. Thankfully the boys at Alternate Universe in Milford, CT are decent people and let me exchange it for a book of Krazy Kat.I'm a pretty huge fan of Spiegelman's work. I even have ""Breakdowns"", published in 1977, NOT 1997 like this book seems to believe!Aside from other errors, it was largely padded. He spent nearly a page explaining what the Holocaust was. Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's. It also was a fairly extensive summary of the history of comic art, but that's not exactly why a person would buy this book.Sorry Mr. Forget, but I was unimpressed."
5,Perfect,"Love this, amazingly sexy. bought it in white for our wedding night so my future husband has something to rip through ;)"
3,A decent knife for the money.,"This budget knife does a fairly good job at cutting bread,tomatos,roasts ect. The knife is light, features a sticky rubber handle and has a very thin blade. I expect a good year out of this knife before replacing. The knife is manufactured out of aus 6 steel (OK for the price) and is produced in Japan. I would probably spend more money next time and buy the F. Dick offset bread knife.F. Dick 7'' off Set Bread/ Utility Knife. Serrated Edge.If your a budget minded consumer that wants a good knife at a compelling price, made in JAPAN vs China, this might be for you. Kershaw offers a lifetime promise on all their cutlery and free sharpening for life, a good bonus for something at this price point"
3,batcycle sort of ok,I don't like how they have batman attached to the batcycle. You can't take him off! But he is good otherwise. He is good and bad. I am a 7 year old boy. I like pie!
4,good stuff,the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
1,Dead On Arrival,"Normally, I would never buy anything from Harman Kardon. But this DVD player was on sell for $100.00 from $300.00. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. I set up the player and placed my first DVD in it. I knew I was in trouble when I hearding a whining, grinding sound. That wasn't too amusing. What was even less amusing was the nice blank TV screen. I tried another DVD just to make sure it wasn't a problem with the DVD. I got the same whining, grinding sound and blank TV screen.It wasn't worth mailing back, in either time or money. I went down to the local Best Buy and bought myself a nice Sony DVD player. It has been working great.I'm waiting to take my HK DVD player outside and re-enact the scene from ""Office Space"" where the guys beat the crap out of the printer. ;-)"
4,best hockey game to date,"I'm not gonna bore you with a long review. Let me just say that it is the most realistic hockey game i've ever played, and I'm very judgemental with these games. Blows nhl 2003 out of the water. Sega sports makes the best sport games."
3,better then nhl 2003 but still not good,buy nhl 2002 its cheaper and better you can update the rosters yourself
5,Fantastic,I use this product to pickup chopped vegetables from my chopping board. I saw it used on a food show and I thought I would try it. I love it.
3,Okay...,"Book was okay...not exactly what I was expecting. The songs were not as advanced as I thought they would be. This was more of a cafe background style of music, nothing that I could actually perform for an audience that was actually listening. The song ""Fleur de Paris"" is not the same song as performed on Christa Behnke's album, so if you are looking for that particular song, this is not the same one."
3,Losing Momentum?,"Reminiscent of Astrud's ""It Might As Well Be Spring,"" Momento slides through the diary entries of Bebel's life, with a lack luster effect, unmatching the energy found within Tanto Tempo. This having been said, I shall have to say that I nonetheless enjoyed Momento, and reserve this album for that special occasion wherein I seek this special space, which only Bebel can create for me. You know, when you throw some classical music on to do some serious writing or study, well, Momento has its own relation, to each and their own. It will be well enjoyed and find a warm place within your heat. Bebel, muita obrigado for these most soothing tracks. Beijos...Gregory von Seewald"
3,"Good, but not great","Not quite as good as her first two albums, but still quite nice. I will be interested to see if there is a remix version of this album as there were for Tanto Tempo and Bebel Gilberto."
3,Soothing and wonderful,"Bebel has such a soothing and beautiful voice, this is a great CD to put on and let it be. Weather listening or simply background music.As a Brazilian/American I partucularly like the fact that she mends Portuguese/English in her songs, it is nice to hear Brazilian music in English.It is a great CD, nothing out of the ordinary as far as being a 5 star but better than average.If you are new to Bebel Id recommend ""Tanto Tempo"" as your first."
4,The Teenage Tragedy Phenomenon,"For some inexplicable reason teenage tragedy was a pop music phenomenon in the late Fifties and early Sixties and this single-disc collection hits all the highlights. ""Last Kiss"", ""Teen Angel,"" ""Endless Sleep,"" ""Tell Laura I Love Her,"" ""Patches"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" all went Top Ten, so apparently sad tales of adolescent woe weren't a detrement to chart success. The only real clunker here is the goofy parody ""Leader of the Laundromat."" [Surprisingly, that song went to No. 19, while ""Leader of the Pack"" was still on the charts.] If you like a good cry now and then--or just need to be reminded that not all pop hits were sunshine and rainbows--this album is for you. RECOMMENDED"
2,An example of silly science fiction,"Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight."
2,Coffee Table Book - good for ideas but no plans or detailed design,"If you're looking for a finnish fireplace design book, look on. This is a picture book showing how a finnish fireplace design can fit into home decor, containing not any plans or technical information. Disappointing."
1,Not DVD Quality,"I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up. In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light. It gets very annoying. There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie."
2,Meh...I've had better.,"I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality."
2,Thomas the Train tracks,"This is a good product, but highly over-priced. $10 for FOUR pieces of track ???????"
1,Mediocre,"I have been reading Moorcock's work ever since I encountered his creations while playing RPGs in the early Nineties. Suffice it to say, Moorcock seems to have nothing more to add to his Chaos-spawned mythology other than an obviously mediocre book. Old hands will probably notice the allusions to the Eternal Champion, a concept which in all the circumlocutions ,Alas! almost put him at par with those lame ""formula writers"". His Blood just fails to churn mine."
5,The Best,"Any fan who appreciates the Everly Brothers has to havethis album. The remastered sound is superb of course, butthe deciding factor on this one should be the inclusionof their last hit, after more than 20 years had passed sincetheir previous one.After the team reunited, one of their biggest fans wrotea song especially for them. Paul McCartney wrote ""Wings ofa Nightingale"" for them, and it is a truly beautiful songthat displays their harmony at its best, and the song isnot usually found on other collections.Get the best of all their classic early hits, plus thislast hit.A must have for any fan."
4,THE BEST BASKETBALL GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is awesome, it has good graphics and other tight things. Like street ball, franchise and dynasty mode. All are awesome no doubt. NBA Live will never be better then this game at all. This is one of the best games that I've ever played. You can slam and drive and shoot and pass. You can also juke like crazy. The free throw is pretty hard, but that's only if you have bad players.So basically, this is about the best game anyone could ever want 2 own."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"The reason i bought this game was beause of all the great reviews from here and game web sites. All i hear was it's the best B-ball sim out there. Well that's a bunch of BS. I don't know how many times playing as kobe, Shaq, Iverson etc.. i've gotten my shot blocked (even on fade aways) by a bench player. As shaq i get a miss match with a 6foot guard so i try backing him down and well i can't. It seems shaq isn't strong enough to plow his way through a 6 footer lol. And when i make him spin to the basket then press shoot 9 times out of 10 he doesn't go for the dunk instead he throws up some off balance,fade away crazy looking shot. The gameplay is challenging but not in a good way. I guess i will try ""NBA Live""."
1,A complete piece of junk,This piece of equipment is aweful. It doesnt work period. Just look at the tech support webpage from ADS an be your own judge.
3,So So,"The only problem I incured running under XP was that I could ony capture video at 3mbs. At 4mbs and 5 mbs the captured image paused and jumped this was after haveing closed all programs, eliminating screen saver and destop image. The picture was okay but would have liked to record at 4mbs."
1,Problems with drivers and Syncing - Don't Buy,"Drivers for XP gave trouble. Had fewer problems with Win ME.However, this baby has problems syncing sound and video. Check all forums on the web, this is a problem everyone has.Doesn't look like ADS is about to fix it any time soon.A definite DON'T BUY."
3,It could certainly be easier...,"This is a real piece of work. And it takes a HUGE amount of work and trial and error, and more error and trial, to get this operational. It does a relatively good job overall, when you get the hang of it. I just hope whoever buys this has the patience, and the time , to get used to it. The vocal sequencing is a real headache@"
3,NICE BUT HARD,Ive just recieved this today and its quite complicated.When i tried to install it on my Laptop my it made alot of trouble so i installed it on my older pc and it functioned well.There are 3 softwares but theyre all average and one of them doesnt work.This is the first time i see a device so annoying like this.I didnt find trouble in the tpes i recorder but i did in the ones i purchased.I guess VHS /DVD converting isnt perfected yet like most devices. Some tapes were recorder othersIm not saying its terrible but you should wait for better devicess to appear
1,bad,Not happy with this product lots problems!!!Not work at all for me. Had a person who is computer nam look at it and everything. He not get it either.
2,"Good piece of hardware, C+ software, terrible tech support","This product is a good idea. However, the software is not easy to use. Unless you have a very powerful PC, and get installation right the first time, you'll be in trouble. Included documentation is of little help and Tech support is a dead end (not to mention arrogant)."
1,Worst ever,"I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. This is neither instant nor is it DVD. It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy."
1,don't waste your money,"I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness. What I got was a book with stories (I read 3 of them before I gave up)that had to be written by horney 13 year olds. This single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to Amazon."
2,This one's a loser,"Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."
5,Excellent addition to Holocaust Literature,Well written with a sense of humor about a very tragic period of time. I liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view.
5,Ballet anyone?,"Franz von Suppe (German form of Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo Cavaliere Suppe-Demelli, which I like better) is known for his ballet music, but the CD series 1-6 contains even more wonderful music. All his music is very conducive to movement, whether ballet or other calisthenics (beauty and strength). Enjoyable when sitting still, too! He is a relative of Donizetti, so he had great musical examples to help him along (probably good genetics, too)."
5,Grat book!,A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
5,This is REAL hockey!!!,"I have been playing hockey games on the PC and on consoles since NHL95. Until now I have not found a console game I could tolerate. I have now found it! NHL 2k3 is the closest to real hockey I have ever played. What makes a game good is flexibility. The sliders in this game make it fun for anyone. The designers have given us the ability to modify the AI even after starting a season, franchise, or even in the middle of a game. You can tweek this baby until you find the right skill level for you. The controls are more like that of the PC. I can chose the setup that lets me use the right trigger for speed burst, to me that's the only way it can be done comfortably. There are just too many good things to mention about this game so I will just finish by saying...EA Sports has just fallen way behind. This game sets the standard for video hockey games."
1,This is the worst hockey game!!,This is the worst hockey game made for this season. This game looks like it was made in the eighties! I rented Hitz and the gave me this by accident. I played it for about twenty minutes and i was so disgusted I didn't touch it again. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone except as a very last resort. After a bout five minutes of playing I had counted three animation glitches and five sound ones. This game was so horrible my family who doesn't know much about games even thought it was horrible. I have been to three rental stores and four different department stores and the highest and the highest anyone gave it was 4/10.
5,A Must Have,"I recently purchased NHL2K3 and I must say I am impressed. Being a loyal follower of the EA NHL franchise I was a slightly apprehensive. But after two games were under my belt I quickly came to the conclusion that this is the best console hockey game to date. The game play is far more realistic than the EA version. That combined with the fact that the game is supported by X-BOX live make this game a must have for any sports console game enthusiast. The live interface does leave a little to be desired when choosing opponents, but the online game play is smooth. Go out and get this game you won't be disappointed."
2,certains bugs viennent tout gacher,"le jeu est bon mais comporte des bugs sur xbox live , les statistiques ne sont pas compiliees correctement sur xbox live. on perd la connection de temps a autre et une deconnection compte parfois pour une defaite... bon jeu a 1 joueur mais pas fort sur le live..."
4,One Reason and one reason only -ONLINE HOCKEY!,"Following up to the excellent 2K2 on the dying Dreamcast, this release will finally allow all the hockey fans out there to play online with XBox Live! This will be the only hockey title to have this feature. I can't wait to play against my brother in Toronto and not have to wait for him or I to visit!"
2,The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd,"The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library ""Prepared by HP"". It is ""an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages."" My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99."
1,Couldn't get it.,"I got no traction at all in this book. Was counting on a friend who also bought it and, sadly, his reaction was the same. I'm going to take another run at it."
1,Two discs won't play.,"Discs 6 and 11 won't play. Big damaged spots, you can see through the discs. Humbly request replacement or refund."
4,"Great read, great escape to a great setting - Victorian England",This book was recommended to me by one of my male friends who is a fairly discriminating reader. I was enthralled in the story and the setting from the first chapter and was sad when it was over. As many other reviewers on here have superbly written up already (and with more litearary critic skills than I will ever have) -- Bayard does an outstanding job of playing in Dickens' sandbox. This book would make a great gift to the avid fiction readers on your Chrismas/Holiday/Other gift list -- I have two brothers-in-law that are certainly getting a copy from me this year.
5,Very imaginative and mysterious,"Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read."
4,"""God bless us every one!""","Sometimes it's better not to know what happens to a fictional character after the book in which he or she appears ends. This is the continuation of the life of Tiny Tim, all grown up now and just about free of the physical problem with his leg. While this book is not badly written, and the characters well-drawn, it seems that it takes an awfullly long time to get to the point of the plot. Several times I felt like putting the book down, but I kept on reading in the hope that it would imprve. It does improve, and once it gets started it moves along briskly until the end. It's not a bad book, but it could really use some initial movement to keep the attention of the reader."
4,Clever twist on a popular character,"What initially drew me to this book was the expanding story of Tim Cratchet (tiny Tim of a Christmas Carol). When a Christmas Carol ends, you feel that everyone lives happily ever after because Scrooge uses his money to make everyone's life infinitely better. The author does an excellent job of presenting a complex and facinating character in Tim. Tim is more than just a crippled boy who got healed. He is now grown up and dealing with the tragedy of his father's passing, accepting money didn't make everything better, and finding the courage to help a small girl he barely knows.While I found this book to be very good, I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 because the mystery/suspense story wasn't very original. I was more interested in Tim's character rather than the mystery surrounding young girls turning up dead in London. However, I would recommend it as a facinating read."
4,touching and thrilling,"Following the route of Gregory Maguire, Louis Bayard has taken a fairly minor yet memorable literary character and revisits him at another point in time. Entirely successful with a fun ""DaVinci Code""-type caper (pacing not the puzzle), Mr. Timothy shines most with Bayard's Bob Cratchit ghost device/letters and depiction of filthy London. Ending is extremely touching and beautifully written a la Dickens; also loved clues of Tim's true sexual orientation: point did not dominate but made perfect sense. This one deserves the Masterpiece Theatre treatment--not the usual American-produced lard.A wonderful, multi-tiered read."
2,Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT,"This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The ""mystery"" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying."
2,avid reader,BORING. this book should have been a short story. i am shocked that people liked it so much.
1,Tiny Tim in Adulthood,"Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
1,Disappointing,"Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back. I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting."
3,Lost... still,"This book was well written... sometimes. I often found myself wandering while reading it (which is not something I do often) I love books set in this time period so I was sad that I did not like this book. The book started clearly and I knew what was happening and then it got muddled and I would get lost and then found for a chapter and lost again. As I sit right now... I am not entirely sure what was going on in this book. For the readers who can not stay focused do NOT buy this book, for the advanced readers, I would check with the library. This is not one I would spend my money on."
3,Be Forwarned,"I read this novel over a year ago. I confess I picked it up being curious about what the author had planned for one of the most loved literary characters in English literature. To be honest I never expected what I got. For that reason,the popular perception of the main character and the nature of the plot, I thought a forewarning might be beneficial for potential readers.The author does present his story well but like Caleb Carr in The Alienist-and consider this a spoiler-it deals with one of harsh and unsavory realities of the underworld of the Victorian age-child prostitution(where for a time the age of consent was as young as 12 and virginity was a commodity to be bought and sold) and all the ugliness that may imply to the modern reader. Banyon does not take a Dicken's approach. Some of the images may be too graphic for the sensitive reader and those uninitiated into this kind of Victorian world and writers like Carr,who I do think is a masterful writer."
3,"good start, then......","One might have wished that the author had used his Christmas Carol background as more than a stepping-off point for a mystery thriller that is occasionally Dickensian in subject matter but scarcely Dickensian in flavor or panache. Somehow I felt I'd been tricked, or that Tim and Uncle Scrooge had somehow been taken advantage of by a well-intentioned author who simply lacked, well, the inspiration of his inspiration. And mysteries that must, toward their conclusions, laboriously explain themselves are not high on my list of pleasures.I didn't have a bad time by any stretch of the imagination, but I am, in the end, disappointed."
2,Too bad it's boring,"The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat."
3,Not the best Fairbanks,"This is the third Fairbanks movie I've seen and quite frankly this is not really that good. It pales when compared to Robin Hood and especially Thief of Bagdad. The movie is too fragmented and needs way too many textboards to keep viewers up to par with the story.Fairbanks is fun to watch and when he's on screen he dominates. However,'presence' is not the same as acting. Fairbanks, and therefore the movie, is way too dependent on farcical comedy. At times the movie even edges dangerously close to a vaudeville act. Also his 'swashbuckling' in this movie amounts to not much more than just wildly wacking away with his sword. Maybe I saw it too soon after the hugely superior Thief of Bagdad...."
5,"My favorite album, period","This album is just so great that it's a crime that so few people know about it. Sometimes just gorgeous and sometimes really crunching cathartic stuff, all combined with the kind of odd murky and haunting sonic atmosphere that you expect from 3MP. This was album was clearly a slapped-together job, comprising of new material plus B sides and outtakes etc over a period of years. And yet the material outdistances anything else they've done. The bass work in particular is phenomenal -- he plays it like a lead guitar. Also, if you're a fan of Pinback then you really should own this. One caveat: I almost never listen to CD2 -- except for the song ""The Trail"", which is great -- and the very first song on CD 1 is really the worst on the album. So don't let that put you off, because the rest of that first CD... wow. Wow! If my desert island disc was limited to one choice, it might be this one. (Well, okay, a Beatles disc might win instead, but only just.) Really, it's that good."
2,Wrong Poster,"The poster I received is okay - it's the one with ""Planet Earth"" written in italics along the bottom, instead of EARTH - but I really would have preferred the one I chose to spend money on, especially since you can buy the one I mistakenly got for .83 instead of $5ish. However, the shipping was fast and the poster was spotless."
2,Wrong Poster,"They sent a similar but incorrect poster, that is only about half as cool. It was missing the NASA sign in the upper left corner as well as the Earth Solar System lettering. Instead there was the words planet Earth written in Italics and a number of fake stars added to the background. The picture of Earth was the same, but the rest of this poster just doesn't compare to what is shown here."
5,Best CD for the bathroom,I LOVE this CD! I listen to it whenever I'm on the can. It helps me do my thing.
5,RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW,IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.
2,doesn't work if you wear glasses,"You look thru a pin-hole to get the sighting, but you can't see thru the pinhole if you wear glasses. If you take your glasses off then you can see thru, but if you're near-sighted like me then you won't be able to see very far in the distance to tell what you're sighting."
5,I REAL DO LOVE LEVEL,I USE THIS LEVEL ON MY JOB SITE TO SHOT GRADE ON DRIT OR PIPE THE VIEW THROW THE SIGHT IS CLEAR AND CLOSE UP IS SPARD
3,Does The Job,"It might not be the best hand level out there, but it does the job. Can't do better for the price. Does have problems with the front lens getting scratched."
3,An abstract take on a Psychological Thriller,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Woman in the Fifth"" (A Drama/Psychological Thriller DVD review)...Liked IT!Genre: 7 Movie 5.5What's it about?A college lecturer flees to Paris after a scandal costs him his job. In the City of Light, he meets a widow who might be involved in a series of murders.What did I think?This could be one of those movies where you still don't understand it until after it's over. I found myself scratching my head as if I had dandruff asking, ""Was that Psychological or Supernatural?"" I would even say this is more of a foreign film, as 85% of it is in french and It seemed filmed as a foreign movie would...very abstract and obscure. If you don't mind subtitles...go for it."
2,"Once again, a great book chopped up like onions.","At a wimpy 85 minutes, so much is left out that unless you've read the book, a lot of what is happening probably won't make any sense.Avoid the movie, but definitely read the book by my favorite author Douglas Kennedy"
1,Huh?,"I have never given a movie 1 star before but here it is. ""Woman in the Fifth"" offers very little in the way of plot or relevancy for that matter. The characters are flat, dull, and the dialog is less than inspiring. This movie is about nothing, literally. There is no back story of any characters, no motivation for their actions or lack there of, nothing. Just nothingness. And then it ends thankfully."
1,Enigmatic and moody and pointless and poo,Save your money and time. This is nonsense attempting to be arty and important. I'd also forgotten how dire an actor Hawke is. Save your time? There is no explanation or direction. Honey Boo Boo has better writin.
2,Not happy. Read the book. Much better.,"Very disappointed by this movie. The book was great and so I anticipated the movie would be as well, especially after seeing who was going to star in the movie.Very disappointed. Slow moving movie - lots missing..."
2,They should have stayed in the fourth.,"I was attracted to this movie by the stars. I have not read the book, but I view movies on the basis of a perceived entertainment value. Unfortunately, this one is not very entertaining, nor is it very believable, even as a so-called psychological drama. It's the first time I've ever been disappointed by Kristen Scott Thomas. Save your money."
1,Stine,"I have been using Exuviance products for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied and feel I have found my skin care products that I intend to use for the future. But, unfortunately I had a bad experience when I ordered the products from Amazon.com(through a dealer called Impossible Discounts)- Rejuvenating Treatment Masque, Hydrating Eye Complex and Clarifying Facial Cleanser. All three products were dirty and did not come with any outer box or sealing. Actually, the products looked used! I have sent this complaint to Exuviance, but have not got any reply and now it is two months since I sent the complaint.. I am afraid that I will not buy Exuviance again nor buying at Amazone again after this incident."
4,Cheap backup,"There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap"
4,"Fun, but not as much fun as the bigger ones...","The light is better for using as a personal source of light. The other, larger ones I got are GLARINGLY brighter and lots of fun."
5,"compelling, riveting and inspiring","In 1980, I successfully climbed Mt. Rainier, reaching the ""true"" summit. It took several attempts because of weather. It was hard work. But after reading Lene's book, I came to realize how strenuous and physically challenging it is to climb Everest. I was not aware of all the work and risks that are taken just to prepare for the final assault. Lene proved herself, showing incredible strength, fortitude and emotion. There must have been such a terrible sense of despair and fear knowing that death was probably inevitable and no help available.Lene gives the reader another perspective of this awesome event, using her professional knowledge as a clinician and writer. I would recommend everyone who has followed this climbing event, either from past magazine articles and stories, or from the several books written about this Everest climb, to read this book."
2,a minor book on the everest tragedy,lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the book is choppy and doesn't grip you like some other books.if you have all the other everest books go ahead and get it but you'll enjoy 'high exposure by breashears and climb by anatoli b. much better
2,Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb,"After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books."
2,wrong category !,"This is not a book about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a book about mt. Everest; this book is about ms. Gammelgaard proving to herself ""she could be the first nordic woman to set foot"" on Chomolungma - big deal ! So maybe you can call this a tale of a driven, achieving lady who singlemindedly pursues a goal, but you will learn nothing about what happened in may, 1996 or about what being on mt. Everest is like; not even close to Krakauer's or Boukreev's books on the same topic: buy those instead."
1,BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL,"As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
1,Don't bother!,"This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is."
1,"Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness?","I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it."
1,"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,","The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
2,All About Lene,"After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"
1,A Major disappointment,"Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
3,if you ignore the psychobabble...,"The disjointed ""dispatch"" style put me off a little at first, but once you get used to it, this book hums right along. Although her writing is technically not up to par with others who've written about May 1996, Gammelgaard gave this reader a very real sense of how a climber might feel. I simply ignored the psychogibberish (she operates some sort of rehab clinic, so the feel-good inner-god hogwash is to be expected) and the endless references to ""Sagamartha, Mother Goddess of the Earth"" and enjoyed the book. Of course, I borrowed it from my library, so I might not be as kind if I shelled out real money for it. So pay those overdue fines, and give it a try."
2,Boring and shallow!,"There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than ""we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm."" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."
1,Self-indulgent drivel,"I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the ""inner game"" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."
4,Cosmological Eye,"I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human."
4,"A quick read, fun, but not an epic.","I am a fan of Perumov's myself, and I have all of his books on my bookshelf ;-]. However if you're not a fan like me, wait until you read Doom of the Gods and Land without Happiness before you get the Warrior of the Great Darkness. Still, do get it once you've finished the other two, as Hjorward experience will not be complete until you finish VVT. Bottom Line: A good read, although not Nick's best."
4,Wonderful Stuff,"This is a superb album with some brilliantly written songs that I find very easy to relate to. Raymond always writes songs from the heart and if more people knew about him they would love his music. Okay they might be quite simple songs but they all have something to say and although Country and Western is not really my thing, this to me is different and I don't see it as Country.I have grown up listening to Raymond Froggratt and there are some songs on this album I find hard to listen to, as they can be a bit cheesey but songs like 'everybody is losing' and 'you sing so blue' are beautiful songs which say a lot. Definately worth listening to if you like songs with good lyrics that come straight from the heart."
4,Good Historical Fiction,"The year is 1852 and we follow a wagon train as it wends its way across the country to the Oregon Territory. Along the way we experience Indian attacks, disease and much death, and some good things as well - romance and bravery. Binns tells the story well and with great feeling for his characters. He has a great feel for the trail as well: it's said that before writing this novel Binns drove a good distance across the Oregon Trail, seeing the sights he would later write about first hand. As a work of literature and not just a genre piece, this novel succeeds handsomely."
3,good seller -- ok product,"product IS as described and DID arrive on time (early actually). However, it's made out of really cheap materials and the strap is attached rather poorly to the mask."
5,Great Video!!!,"I have a 22 month old son who LOVES this DVD. He is really into trucks, fire engines, and ambulances. Basically, any vehicle that makes noises. He begs for me to put this in every day. He was not afraid at all in the beginning when Elmo shakes. They do show Elmo very afraid, but the adults in the DVD really do everything to make him feel better and let him explain his feelings. There are catchy songs and good fire safety information. You should preview this DVD and judge for yourself if your child is to sensitive for the part where Elmo shakes in the beginning. If you feel that part is to scary for your child then skip to the next chapter of the DVD. It's a small part of the DVD and the rest of the DVD has so much educational material. I highly recommend this DVD."
2,Too Scary for Younger Tots,"While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children."
5,Elmo,"When my granddaughter was small, she loved this video and squealed with delight when the fire truck drove out of the Fire House. Alas, she grew up. My grandson is now 2, and I may have bought this prematurely for him. He loves Elmo, so I know he will eventually get into this video. Video also includes some good information as to how to act if there is a fire in your home. Very instructive for small children."
4,Fire Education a MUST,"This is a very well done educational (IMHO) DVD. Elmo DOES become scarted, and your child might be scared a bit while watching it, but fire is scarey and it isn't a bad thing to see Elmo scared. Maria is there with him all along, and mom or dad should be with the child when first viewing this DVD...we used this as a spring board to talk about good fires (to cook with, fireplaces etc) and bad fires. Kids even in day cares have fire drills, so they aren't as sheltered as most parents think when it comes to fire. But, having a plan in YOUR home is something that everyone should TAKE time to make. This DVD helps open the door to conversation, and helps kids not be afraid of the firefighter suits. A good point is made, the firefighter tells Elmo even if the firefighter looks scarey, he is there to help, and if in a fire go to the firefighter not away. I also like the ""get low and go"" tag line it helps us all remember to Get low and Go!"
1,Scared Stiff,My son's day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. He is 2 1/2 years old. He still is concerned most days as we pull in the driveway that they will show it again.
1,Not Actually Available,"Tried to watch this using our ROKU (we've watched other amazon content this way), but when you try to watch, it says content not available. Annoying since the easiest way to search is online. Back to the search."
1,Bad job!,"I bought this video thinking that it would be a great tool to teach about fires. Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part. They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job."
4,riveting dvd for toddlers,"my 22 month old son is somewhat interested in Elmo's World on Sesame Street, but he was riveted to this entire DVD about Firehouses. I don't know if he grasped all the concepts yet, but it's a decent DVD with solid safety concepts in it about fires & firefighters."
3,good gift im sure,"this is a christmas gift for someone so ask me in january! my kids had ""Big Bird visits The Firehouse"" 15yrs ago and it was a favorite! wish they still made it!"
3,Great for kids 5 years old and younger,"My kids at 6 and 9 enjoyed the dvd, but were just old enough to find it somewhat slow and boring. I would not buy this for a child older than 5."
2,Poor quality,The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying. I would look else where for a piano DVD.
4,Very Good Western,Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher combine their talents once again to make an exciting western/civil war movie.Scott is ask to leave his Civil War duties back east to run a stageline full time to deliver gold to the union.The transfer from the Warner Archive line is beautiful. Very crisp and colorful.All-in-All gets a B+ from me.
4,"A good, traditional western","This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc.), but still a very good one (4,5!). Scott is always good. He is so natural that one does not give enough credit for his acting. There are a lot good actors in this film though my favorite Virginia Mayo does not have very much to do. The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great."
1,Disappointed,This book basically gives you the history of words and how they were established. It was not what I was looking for! Not a good read!
2,Vocabulary Extender,"Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Just a poor attempt at a primer."
1,Not up to HD standards,"This game is poor - not realistic for anyone that rides a Harley. The game uses keystroke only - no joystick or wheel, and the sound doesn't resemble any Harley I ever heard, including my own. I can't believe HD let Activision use their name for this game."
5,A Master Teacher!,"Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."
5,Trigger steals the show,"Quentin Tarantino lauded William Witney's directing of this movie and Roy's performance in a New York Times interview this year (2000). Trigger is blamed for a killing done by a wild horse, and Roy confesses to the crime to save him and serves three years for manslaughter. Witney once again handles animal scenes with finesse as the wild mare dies after giving birth to Trigger Jr. A beautiful story, in color showing off both golden palominos, in which Roy temporarily loses Trigger to a band of diamond smugglers and recovers him in a typical Witney action climax."
4,"Lovely color, pretty horses, great cowboys","One of the better Roy Rogers films, especially for fans of Trigger. When diamond-smugglers hide their stolen treasure inside the horseshoe of a gorgeous golden mare, Roy Rogers and Trigger are hot on her trail (Trigger for reasons other than Roy's, obviously). When Trigger is accused of murdering one of the smugglers, Roy takes the rap and goes to jail. The plot takes on more curly-cue twists than the designs on Roy's fancy saddle when the mare gives birth to Trigger Jr., and Trigger is taken by the thieves. Roy, finally out of jail, uses the colt to catch the bad guys and get Trigger back. If you're a real Trigger fan, don't miss 1946's My Pal Trigger, which follows the prized palomino from his birth through his first meeting with his pardner Roy. Another great Trigger movie moment is in 1952's Son of Paleface in which he costarred with comedian Bob Hope.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Charecters Growing Old,"Starting too tire of the crews attitude and arrogance. They are cops for Pete's sake, not the end all of morality and all that is good. The episodes are starting to blend together and all have a familiar undertone of we are better then you feeling. These folks need a good dose of humble pie."
4,CSI continues to bring the detective side out of you.,"After becoming addictive to the CSI series, I just can't seemto get enough. So I purchased the third complete series to geton with the excitement and I couldn't stop.Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotionsand perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And WarrickBrown returns to his oldneighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.All in all, if you're into CSI: Las Vegas, you'll enjoy thisseason as mush as 1 and 2."
5,Simply the Best Show!,"I got introduced to CSI this year and have been addicted ever since. It is a great show. Great characters and great cases that all you need to have a great show. The mysteries are so well put together and thought out. Buy this box set and in the future, you will be buying others."
2,Season Three Lacking,"Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons. The episodes are tired and formulaic, and the ""surprise"" season finale is laughable. Continuity is thrown out the window and the storylines are fractured. Buy the first and second seasons to see the best of CSI."
5,exactly as advertised,"The DVD arrived quickly and exactly as advertised. Plus, the pricing was better than retail. Thanks!"
3,no good for deafies!,Love the concept of the show but the fact that it does not have sub-titles for those with hearing problems (like me!)will deter me from purchasing any more. Disappointing!!
4,Fun Show..but....,"CSI is just one fine TV series, though it can go from engrossing the viewer to grossing the viewer out with some of its all-too-ugly scenarios. Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?"
4,VANESSA-MAE - VIOLINIST!! NOT JUST A CLASSIC!!!,"Vanessa-Mae is an amazing talent. This young woman is beautiful as well! She gives an energetic pulse to her violin playing! I never tire of hearing her enthusiastic version of 'Cotton-Eyed Joe' or the 'Can Can'. Will have you rethink the definition of 'classical' music...a definite must-hear!!! As I don't see her scheduling any tours in the Sac area, I will probably purchase her concerts on DVD, next."
5,Amazing....,"she is an Excelent and great violin player, her music is unique, if you love instrumental music, you can't miss it."
5,"Excellent, sophisticated.","I read this book several years ago. One of the better, more cerebral espionage books I've ever read. Been trying to find his other spy book (i.e., ""Zolta""), but its out of print. Too bad the author does not appear to be writing this type of fiction anymore--while his nature stuff is good, I'd love to see him fill the void left by Adam Hall."
5,Wonderful Upgrade,"I have purchased this knife as an upgrade from a Farberware Pro Chef's Knife. Kershaw is a lot thinner, lighter, and infinitely sharper (buy some Band Aids). It has enough curve for a rocking low motion and long enough for high cutting technique. I love it.P.S. Still love it after half a year, recommend dulling the blade corner near the pummel, it will reduce number of little cuts with out sacrificing usability."
2,not bad for a cheap knife!,"cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
4,Monster Rancher Advance 2,"The agme starts out with good game play, but after a while you lose the needed story line."
1,This is not what I was looking for,"Why are they still selling this? Worth a laugh, but the feature is 30 minutes long and I bet your laugh won't last all the way to the end."
1,Why Cripsin? Why?,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it"
2,Not worth it.,"I like Crispin Glover and i am a huge horror and genre fan, but this movie was weak, really weak. I like movies sometimes that are bad, because they are bad in a way that is funny or even enjoyable. This was a movie that was bad and after it was over I say ""I just wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was) of my life on this crap!"""
4,Brief but Useful Introduction,"I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs."
3,American pronunciation/Wymowa amerykanska,"A reprint of a 2-volume classic dictionary first published in Hague by Mouton & Co. The only large one exclusively based on American pronunciation. The English-Polish volume I has 1037 pages, and the Polish-English volume II - only 772.Przedruk 2-tomowego klasycznego slownika opublikowanego po raz pierwszy w Hadze przez Mouton & Co. Jedyny duzy bazujacy tylko na wymowie amerykanskiej. Tom I angielsko-polski ma 1037 stron, a tom II polsko-angielski - tylko 772."
3,Requires Drilling,These hinge pins differ from the factory pins. The original equipment pins taper to a smaller diameter about the middle of the pin. These do not. I had to drill the top hole out for the pin to go through then I had to drill the holes for the bushings to fit but once everything was put together the new pin and bushings work great. No more door sag and also eliminated the wind noise around the front seal.
5,Bonus Tracks Not Much A Bonus,"The additional songs aren't that great, so if you already have the original album, it's not much worth buying this CD solely for the bonus tracks. The original album is one of the better Cranberries albums, but all Cranberries CDs are great, and that includes this one, a must have to complete your Cranberries collection."
2,Introduction to New Age Cults,"A very brief but necessary introduction for those who don't know but would like to know just a little of what's happing with what is called the New Age Occultism. This well know author of many books in this area introduces the fresh reader to people, topics, and a short glossary, and history to the ever present New Age Occultism, along with the latent dangers of this religious movement."
1,From the biggest CULT of all!,"So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"
1,The New Age Cult,"Save your money, i'm not sure whats more disturbing the fact that a doctor wrote this garbage or that people will probably believe him."
1,the item i got is broken,"dear sir,i tried to contact you many times ,regarding this itemwhen i opened the box the faucet handle was broke and i can send you pictures if neededregardshaj hasanmohamad.hajhasan@gmail.com"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"It is the worst book I have ever seen.I passed both CFA and AICPA and familarize with those materials. I still find it difficult to follow. Not clear explaination, contradiction among arguments and wrong answers for the sample questions.I am very disappointed."
1,How not to write a book,"I bought this book to write the FRM exam. It is the worst possible written book that I have ever seen. Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment. I wonder if anybody at GARP ever reviewed it before recommending it as a text for the FRM exam."
1,Hope this book is not representative of GARP's credibility,"Is there anything less than 1 star? For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?"
1,Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation?,"As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning."
1,I Wish I Hadn't,"This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials."
3,A must-have for the FRM exam,"Jorion's book is indispensable (and, in my experience, sufficient) when preparing for the FRM exam; if you are taking it, think no more. An added bonus is the impressive number of typos and errors to test your knowledge :)"
2,Lots of errors,"This book is misleading. Contains impressive amount of errors, that leads readers to learn wrong concepts. I am starting to doubt that this book was written by a Phd. Or if it was, then lets revoke his title. Hope they release some decent review on this."
3,"Good Start, but fix the errors!!!","The errors in the sample test questions (and answers) need to be fixed! And since the sample test question came from GARP, then GARP should get on the stick and appoint someone in their org to fix 'em.If the errors had not been present, I'd have given it 5 stars. Book does a good job at taking the reader from start to finish across many different aspects of risk management, and in a very organized way. Not at an extremely quantitative level of depth, but enough so that you know about the big picture (risk-wise) regarding bonds, equities, commodities, credit risk, market risk, ops risk, regs, etc. I encourage all middle office trade analysis personnel to read this book from cover to cover, and to go for the GARP cert.I will use it as a reference, I'm sure."
1,Redundant and Too Expensive,"This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff. The message seems to be that, if you can't make sense of his first book, you should shell out $100 to give him a second chance. Save your money. It is not worth it."
5,"Buy or steal....no matter what method, Get these tapes.",You cannot go wrong with Mr. Stuart Wilde's teachings. Each book he writes or tapes/CD he produces is a jewel. He's a great teacher and these tapes will really help the one who seeks knowledge in living courageously with awareness.
1,I gave it a try...,"Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with."
1,Does not work on Windows XP!,"Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center, but I have XP Pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution. I suspect that it's like another game we purchased that worked fine when XP first came out, but Windows Auto Update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old Win 98 games like this.We have it up and running on an 11 year old laptop with Win 98 , but it's too CPU intensive to run properly on that old thing.The game seems OK for the right PC and operating system though..."
2,"Great book, bad product","The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase ""L"".Find another printing."
1,don't use this book for a class,"The soft back edi- tion of this book is full of misedit- ed copy (full of sep- arated text (annoying isn't it?). It also does not have the publication date or a full title page. I wrote a report using the date of 2006 because that was the only date I could find. Lastly, whole portions of text are missing from this edition. My advice, spend the extra money and get a different edition."
3,"Myths, Quests, and Leprechauns","Stephens' ""Crock of Gold"" is an interesting little amalgam of cosy Irish folktale,Celtic mythology, and the Hero's Quest. What makes it unusual is that, through the course of the book, three different heroes--male and female--undertake separate life-altering journeys. The characters all have interesting eccentricities, and their struggles present different morals of life. The ending, such as it is, is diffuse and you can decide for yourself just what sort of allegory the author intended. A pleasant little tale for bedtime reading."
3,Missing pages in book.,"The book got to me in good time but upon looking through the book there are some pages missing and this is a gift for my daughter, it is the picture and graph of one of the cat projects. I do not remember reading that there were missing pages?"
4,brilliant pop nostalgia,"calm, soothing, comforting. listening to this just now put me back in the womb of the dreamy days or 80's brit pop. my friend said it was depressing to him, but not to me. it put me inside an atmosphere that felt familiar -- but most definitely not a depressing one. the vocals, the music...it's all so lovely!"
5,Great Album,"I down loaded this for my Mother for Christmas. She loves the harmony of the songs. I burned a CD for her to play in the car while they travel. We all love it, I plan to make a CD for myself so I can listen to it in the car. Another Christmas Album that is wonderful is The Singers Unlimited Christmas. They are a Jazz group, but their harmony is even closer than that of the Mills Brothers. They are both very good albums."
3,MINI WIERLESS CAMERA,"This camera is good but it looses signal very fast, so sound which is fine for a plane. Its more of a security camera than it is a ""model airplane"" camera. You get what you pay for with cameras. I think this is cheep but its up to you."
1,Junk,This wireless camera only works 5 ft away from the receiver. It is supposed to be 100m. What is the point of wireless if you have to be that close?
1,HORRIBLE CAMERA!,"I recently ordered this camera hoping I could fly my helicopter controlling it at close range. Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera."
4,Works as expected,The camera works fine and was easy to setup and use. I'm not good with distances but I'm guessing the range was about 200 ft
2,Horrible video,I purchased this wireless camera for use in a medium size model helicopter. Unfortunately the range and quality of the video is quite weak. Even the smallest movement of the camera causes the video to destabilize and lose all detail. Might be good in a fixed location.
2,sucks,It's not what you'd expect. Almost all signals around interfere with the video and audio of this camera. I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption. Not a good product at all. Will be more careful what cameras I buy next.
2,not happy,"great concept, however, tuning is imposable, you get some horizontal instability 98% of the time. but when you get it, it looks decent!"
2,Camera controls make life miserable,"I like platformers, which is why I got this game. I've played it off and on for a week now, only because I hate not finishing something I start. If it weren't for that fact, I'd never touch this game again. The graphics are good, but the camera controls are [bad]. I've died more than once because the game decided to adjust the camera angle while I was in the middle of crossing some tiny bridge or climbing a narrow ledge."
2,oh well,"Well yea sure its supposed to be this wonderfull, amazing, groundbreaking platform game. Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank. All in all it probably would be pretty fun and thus you should add one or two stars if your new to this kind of thing, or add a few stars if you really really really like large environments or just platforming in general."
1,Vexx fails,"Basically, you can say that this game is about 30% fun and 70% Frustrating. The gameplay is uneccesarily difficult at times and ceases to be 'fun' after about 4 levels in. The camera is terrible. Some have said here dismiss it as 'oh well, all platform games have camera problems'. However, this game definately has the lamest camera of them all.Another dissapointment is the fact that there are no milestones. If you [expire], you get to start over. Period. No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time. Isn't that Fun?Acclaim has definately failed in their foray into platform gaming. Get Ratchet and Clank or Rayman, you will actually enjoy those games. This one looked like it had potential but is just too frustrating. Don't waste your money on this game. It just ain't worth it."
4,GREAT PLATFORM GAME,I am so tired of people talking about bad camera angles. There isn't a game that doesn't have them so get over it. This game is one of the best platform games I have seen. I played all the way through JAK & DAXTER and SLY COOPER without hardly thinking. Both are great games but way to easy. Vexx not only is a great game but it is actually somewhat challenging. Not to say it doesn't have it's easy parts too. I hope to see a sequal. If you like PLATFORMERS you gotta play this.
4,VEXX,"This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide. It's very basic, dosen't cover the controls, and just skims over the walk throughs. It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline."
1,terrible,Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
2,Poor quality on Kindle,I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup.
4,A View Ahead?,"I read this book for a Utopian Lit class at my high school and thought that it represented the totalitarian views very well. I did not like how Winston gave in after fighting so hard to try to make changes. I can see that this world is entirely possible in the not-so-distant future. The way that their society is set up, there is no way to change it. The telescreens, are already in use in terms of security cameras, hidden cameras, etc. It is really easy to find out anything about anybody today. This is quite scary."
5,My Favorite Book,"Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes. If you want to see wether Winston accomplishes his mission, you must read the book. After you read this book go check out the 1984 Movie. But don't see the Movie unless you've read the book or else you will have no idea what is going on in the movie."
4,Present Day 1984,Scary how almost real this could be in the very near future. It is a clear depiction of how our politician's overzealous control is beginning to run our lives.
3,Good book for its time,This book was prophetic in many ways. The ideas of Big Brother and War is Peace described what society was and was developing into. The bleakness of the story adds to its futuristic vision. I recommend this book to those who analyze society and governments.
1,"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I","While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
1,1984,"1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*."
1,Centennial Edition a Rip Off!! Buy a cheaper version,"I had never read 1984 and was very excited to do so only to regret purchasing this edition. In the forward (by thomas pynchon) the entire ending is revealed in great detail. I knew what to expect through the entire book and I really wish that I could get my money back. Dont buy the centennial edition, or at least dont read the forward if you want a nice surprising read."
3,Not as pictured....,"I bought this book because of the great story and the front cover. The story is fine, apart from the 70 odd page preface, but the front cover is nothing like the that pictured. Most disappointing as this was a 21st birthday present for my brother born in 1984. Not happy."
3,"A classic, but not a great story","I tend to like books with more action than the way this book was written. I also feel like I had a hard time grasping the full meaning intended by the author. Having said that, take my impression and opinion with a grain of salt.This book was more of an expression of feeling, than a good story. The idea of the government watching everybody all the time is fascinating to me albeit ridiculous. He seemed to express hoplessness toward mans future, and extreme cynicism about the reasons for war. He was clearly a socialist. I wonder what George Orwell would have said about the way England, or Israel deal with terrorists in 2010?OK I'm off my soapbox now... I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in conspiracies, just for the fact that it is a classic."
4,Ugh. Gives me the shivvers.,"This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."
4,Important for its portrayal of the mechanisms and motivations of totalitarian power,"Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power. A dramatic, illuminating read."
5,Great read!!!,This should me a must read for everyone. It will make you think twice about things that go on in our government and those around the world.
3,That Hath Such People In It,"like all the dunderheads that are falling over themselves to fellate Orwell and his hackneyed take on a negative utopia. Unfortunately the one trick pony (communism is bad....BOO!) needs to be put out to pasture, and don't get me started on Animal Farm, the allegory that makes one wish to stay in the cave. These two works are as bad as the two analogies I just made.The proles have been eating this tripe up for too long.Read 'Brave New World'"
2,"George, Stick to Non-Fiction","This is the second time I've been forced to read this book for aclass, and I have to ask, ""What's the point?"" Maybe if you live in a country that's a monarchy, this book's worth reading, but this is *America*, ok? The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. ""Brave New World"" played up the science fiction aspect of it's ""futuristic"" setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (""Animal Farm""), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (""double-speak?"" Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try ""The Road to Wigan Pier,"" which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened. It's 2000. 1984 was a bad movie with Michael J. Fox."
1,A redundant book of philosophy and vericose vains,"While embarking on this ""classic,"" don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"
2,not good,"Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it."
2,A little too slow,"I found 1984 to be an intriguing book. The plot of the book was interesting. How the author went about telling the story was too slow for me. I found it hard to pay attention while reading it. Throughout the entire book there were bits of intereseting parts followed by several paragraphs of, what i found to be, random information. I though it was a great plot but the storyline wasn't to my liking."
3,19-eighty four (opinion),"My name is Kevin Olson I am a senior at walla walla high school and I recently read the book 1984, I really enjoy most science fiction books, but in 1984 I had complaints about the fact that I felt like i was outside looking down on the characters instead ofbeing along side of them during the different ordeals through out the story. the mood generally seemed hopeless in both the beginning and the ending. I think that it was like a movie with a very bad ending. so if you want to watch a movie thats based on this book, but has a better ending then go ahead and watch the movie equilibrium."
1,Not a helpful history book AT ALL,"I was doing a research paper on the year 1984, and according to my teacher, NONE of this actually happened.I got a flippin' F.Last time I ever read a history book by this Orwell scrub.He doesn't know a thing about the 80s.Not ONCE did he mention Def Leppard or Karma Chameleon.I gave my copy to a donkey.He said it was about communism.Ass."
3,George 1984,"Only thing I disliked about the book was the fact that I had to tape the cover, as it was falling apart."
3,Jason's review of 1984,1984 was a desent book. The caution of not ever letting a Totalitarianist government come to power was the over arching theme of the book. There were several thought provoking passages that made me think about the world in a new way. However the plot and charcters seemed dull and uninteresting to me. This isn't a book I would recomend to anyone who wants a casual book to read but if you want a book that will make you think a little than this is a good book to choose.
4,A Modern Classic,1984 is a great read but not a compelling one. It can be a little hard going at times. The characters are a little frustrating thus making it a little annoying to read. Still it is a great classic and well worth persuing to the end.
3,A little boring,"The book tries and does send out a good message for our future. Orwell warns against giving the government the ability to destroy our privacy and control us. Yet, I found htat the book as very slow at times. I almost had to force myself to read on."
1,Big Brother Lives,"Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online."
2,"thing plot, boring read","Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."
4,Nice to have an actual paper copy,"Good condition book. Look forward to passing it down to kids, grandkids, etc after our media begins to get censored here in the USA...Coming soon, you know."
5,Just what I expected,"It was a good book. It was not my favorite book ever, but I feel more cultured because I read it."
3,Think For Yourself,"Although slow at the start one cannot help, but be swept up in the events that transpire in Orwell's 1984; most especially because of the potentiality of them to arise in any societal faction. The story line and its climax are not necessarily what draws the reader in, but instead the possible reality of the situation portrayed. Moreover, although one tends to lean more towards the ""this could never happen"" scenario what's disturbing is how easily a mass of people can be lead like a more inferior animal such as a sheep. Disturbing events in history, most poignantly the Holocaust, only support the docile nature of the human being as a whole. This novel was more thought provoking than literally captivating. It's the questions that are posed at the conclusion of the novel that make it a must read even more than the words between the cover."
4,Amazingly accurate,"Despite the extremity with which orwell depicts this totalitarian state, this story speaks at a much smaller level as well. in a day and age where brainwashing among civilized countries is ignored despite its presence, this is an important novel. Studies have shown how humans, like chimps, end up gaining a following when in a dominant position in society. only 1984 shows how humans take it to the extreme. Of course this novel does use exaggeration to stress its point. And it does so quite effectively, I might add. The end is fantastic, a climax that is the culmination of Smith's life."
3,It was ALRIGHT...coming from a teen,"Well, I was forced to read 1984 for my english class in high school, and welp, it bored the hell out of me. Though, I'd have to say everything about it is indeed overwhelming and too much to take in at the same time. Perhaps if i was 30 years old or something, i would have liked it more. I dunno, it just didn't appeal to me all that much. I understand the point of the novel, the fear of governments taking over unjustly, but man, what's with the details! Gooood.....anyway, i do reccommend the book because behind everything, the premise is something to think about..."
3,not Orwell's best,"""My recent novel is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism or the British Labour Party (of which I am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions to which a centralised economy is liable and which have already been partly realised in Communism and Fascism. I do not believe that the kind of society I describe necessarily _will_ arrive, but I believe (allowing of course for the fact that the book is a satire) that something resembling it _could_ arrive."" (G.O., letter to Francis A. Henson, 16 June 1949)This is not Orwell's best book. I've read it three times, and never failed to be underwhelmed. Try _Down and Out in Paris and London_, _Homage to Catalonia_ or _A Collection of Essays_ for insightful writing, and stay away from the satires (the other being _Animal Farm_)."
3,"Great job with setting and character, but neglects plot","orwell does good job with the setting, characterization, and images throughout the novel, but fails to elaborate on the plot. This is what took away from the story. Everything else was top notch! Great book!"
3,Overrated,"This book is entertaining, but hardly prophetic. The world is not like 1984 or even close to 1984. Anybody who thinks so needs to learn more about the world or 1984.The problem with this dystopic vision is that Orwell really doesn't understand technology or the way that it affects the world."
1,It was a very good description of life during anti-social ti,It was a very good description of life during anti-social time
1,this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*-,"1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."
3,Very Unique!,"1984, there isn't anything too exciting about that title. Why would you buy a book called 1984? I'll tell you why. Because 1984 is a very unique and interesting book. It has a very different idea of how the author (George Orwell) thought the year 1984 was going to be like. Though we know how 1984 really was, it is still very interesting. This book follows a man named Winston and the horrible conditions he and the world are living in. Could the world turn into something this horrible? Telescreens everywhere, watching everything you do? Thought Police out to get you? It sure makes you wonder. It's almost... scary."
4,1984,"Although the images are not profound and the grammar and language usage rather basic, what holds this novel together are its plot, intelligent ideas, and unique, beautifully flawed characters. I loved the fatal relationship between Julia and Winston, mostly because it was unsentimental and virtually realistic. I don't think Orwell romanticizes anything, alluding perhaps to the bleak style of life led in the book. (The denouement between the two is stunning, yet tragic). The novel ends on a melancholic, similarly unhappy note, which epitomizes the main idea presented: there really are no happy endings, and sometimes there is no winner. Winston, our anti-hero, already dull at the beginning, goes full circle, culminating in a conclusion full of Orwellian grace and sadness. Perhaps the ending was the best part of all, as it leaves the reader feeling like the world of 1984 is, in fact, real and never-ending. Clearly, that was Orwell's point."
5,Science fiction?,"To call 1984 a work of science fiction is, while technically accurate, somewhat a disservice to the book. 1984 is a chillingly accurate glimpse into a future of hellish totalitarianism, and quite amazingly, with each passing generation it actually seems to become more and more relevant. It should be regarded not only as great literature, but also as an oracle of the very real storm clouds that are consistently looming just overhead. But perhaps most importantly, it should also serve as a much needed kick in the groin to anyone who is constantly blinded by the bright lights of patriotism, war, greed, fear, and all forms of propaganda.1984 is not science fiction. 1984 isn't fiction at all."
4,"A very goog book, but not brilliant.",The best science-fiction book I've read (the only sci-fi I've read). It was actually quite good.
4,More thrilling than any Steven King book!!,People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think
4,So terrifying and frustrating that you can't put it down,"I sat down to read George Orwell's novel on a Tuesday night while my family had dinner in the next room. For the following few hours, their dinner conversation was interrupted with my bursts of anger and frustration. ""How can you call the destruction of words beautiful?!"" I cried. Orwell writes so convincingly that it frightens the reader into thinking, ""What if Oceania really existed in that form? How could I break free from the oppression, the mindlessness, the fear and anger that surrounds all aspects of life?"" It creates a level of paranoia, especially since there is no happy ending. The main character, Winston, is never freed from the bondage of being brainwashed and held captive in his own mind. For if we are not free to think, we are not free at all. However, I think Orwell succeeds best in terrifying us to the point that we are sure to count our blessings and be sure not to take for granted the beauty of words, thoughts, and freedom."
5,can predictions really come true? read and make up your own,"George Orwell has another hit. Animal Farm was only a glimpse at his intellectual genius. This story takes you on a carefully regulated emotional rollercoster. You will go from intense shock to indignation for the characters involved. This small glimpse into what Orwell considered to be our inevitable future has left me with a strong sense of denial. Everything from the telescreen that watches your every move to the mere thought of a ""thought Police"" force gave me the shivers. There are several interesting implications for example the use of a term called ""doublethink"" which implies that people can hold two contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time and beleive them both to be true. overall this book was an amazing peice of work, there was never a time that i put it down unless i had to. i would definitely recommend this to any person who wants to take their mind for a ride."
5,Time to think,"George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."
5,An amazing and thought provoking novel,"George Orwell had my attention from the first to last page of his novel 1984. 1984 is a fascinating and mind-inducing novel. The story of Winston Smith's struggle through life in Oceania is extremely captivating and thought provoking. Orwell's sharp, detailed descriptions paint an image of an unforgettably unique society. His story is a detailed description of a man living in the worst case scenario communistic society. Orwell's ideas and images are extremely brilliant. His extreme communist society brainwashes their citizens to become emotionless, violent, and thoughtless. I was mesmerized by the way the society dehumanized its citizens. People had no freedom what so ever. The concept of people having the inability to think, loves, and express themselves is engaging. I found 1984 to be an extremely thrilling novel, I recommend it to anyone interested in a classic and contemplative piece of literature."
4,1984 Review,I thought the book 1984 was great. It really made me think about weather or not I was pro Big Brother or con Big Brother. At the end of the book I decided to diagree with Big Brother. It is too powerful and controling. There are some forms of Big Brother that we think nothing of and don't even care that they're around even though there it's watching your every move. 1984 was an awsome book that kept getting better and more interesting with every page.
3,Super-deep story written for unthinkers,"Overall, a very interesting story..However, I found some parts super-cheesy - some parts of the book, some phrases written by the author seemed to be written with the intent of making some super-deep, human, philosophical point. For my taste, the author too clearly delivers these points...doesn't leave enough of the wrenching analysis and thought formation to the reader. Some points are so blatantly delivered I couldn't help but cringe, look away from the text, and say ""ohh man..."".Not nearly as elegant as Huxley in Brave New World."
4,2008 is 1984,"""It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words"" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."
4,"Now, more than ever, you should read this book!","Pros: This book seemed to be a science-fiction book about the future, but in truth, it was a sci-fi symbolism of totalitarianism in Orwell's time. Yet, this book is so timely today! It reminded me of the way Bush and friends control our thoughts with smart words; GOOD Americans believe in the war and TRAITORS believe in other causes. We should always keep our own opinion and forget the always-swaying popular opinion. And that was just ONE of the many things I learned from this great book! I highly suggest this book.Cons: It was a bit repetitive and it's a very heavy read."
4,1984,"At the time this book was written, in the 1950's, this book was feared as a posssible future for the world. This story is a bleak prediction of the future of man. Whatever they say is the rule, whatever they you think is ungaurdable, and even the smallest change in your apperence is subject for search. The biggest question of all though, is not how you can escapes, but who can you escape from. They know everthing that you are doing because of the telescreens located in every room and any thought of treason is picked up. This is the story about a man in this world, all alone, trying to figure out which is which. He knows the Party lies, and can even alter the past, but in a world where alliances wavor, and there is no certainty about who you are, how does he know he is fighting against the right people. Even if he can trust someone, there is another problem, ""Big Brother is Watching"""
4,What a grim future!,"Long before I read 1984, I read Brave New World and Anthem. All three have similar subject matter: the bleak future. Both Brave New World and 1984 depict technology run rampant and used to further de-humanize the populous. 1984 is a bleak book, but in parts very powerful. I would say, however, that at times Orwell lost my interest. He is in love with narrative, which is fine, but occasionally it drones on. I would say that Brave New World is a better book to read about how the future CAN go wrong, mainly because it is much more entertaining. But 1984 has a ton of integrity, especially in the ending."
5,Definitely a must read,"1984 is the biggest achievement of Eric Blair as a novelist and anybody even slightly interested in politics, history or the future should give it a read. I think 1984 is one of the few books which you can't skip reading and just watch the movie. Very detailed, very thorough, very challenging - the book is more than 50 years old, and yet very very current. I've read it more than 5 times now, but the paperback copy from amazon is definitely the nicest edition I've had - printed on something that looks like recycled paper, roughly cut and printed in weird, but nice font - I recommend buying it."
5,Perfect,This is such a great book! I ordered it on cassette so that I could listen to it on a long road trip and the product arrived right on time in great condition.
5,oh yes. this is a good one.,"this was the first novel ever that i have finished (i tend to read the first few pages and quickly move over to the end). yes. like a winter in london under heavy smog, this novel has a gloomy, cold, and a bit cynical perspective. but there's something pulling you in. it's the secret love between winston and julia. so beautiful. soon to be crushed like a flower under some fat tires, though..."
2,Kindle Edition is a very sloppy copy/paste,"The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file."
5,Early Perspective - take warning,1984-A good example of what government can and may do. Good warnings of what may happen when government is given too much power and how it may completely take over without being noticed. Depressing but gives good insight. READ IT!!
5,"The best book you should read, but don't in High School","Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
5,Deserves SIX stars!,"I wish there was a way Amazon would let you rate ONE book with six stars, your all-time favorite. If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet."
4,"Be cautious, Kindle owners","Obviously a great book, but the Kindle edition (at least) omits the Appendix ""The Principles of Newspeak"" which any reader should want to have!"
5,A Brilliant Warning About Totalitarianism,"George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty Four"" is a brilliant warning about totalitarianism. It is certainly about communism. You can tell from their physical descriptions that Big Brother is Stalin and Goldstein is Trotsky. At a time when many people admired the Soviet Union, George Orwell saw the Soviet system for what it was- a brutal dictatorship based on fear. However, it is not just about communism. It is a warning against all totalitarian systems of thought that seek to impose forcibly a particular ideology on people and to mould people at will. Winston Smith's struggle to hold on to objective truth in a world of lies and human decency in a world of cruelty symbolises the real life struggle to do just that of so many people in this century that has brought us the horrors of the Gulags and Auschwitz."
5,This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind,This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
5,Very realistic!,In my opinion this is Orwell's best novel and is also my favorite book. It can happen to us as long as their are power hungry human beings in this world.
3,1984,"This was a decent book it was written well, there was times when I did not want to put down the book becuase it had some interesting parts in it. But the down side is that I thought that these were to few and far inbetween becuase it was kinda of slow paced and I would lose interest and want to do something else. I found myself forcing myself to read it (becuase I had to for school) rather than read for enjoyment. another negative about the book is that 1984 has pasted and it was nothing like this and it just kind of ruins it for me I would have given this book a 4-5 stars if I had read it sometime between 1950-1965 which I bet was a very good book back then. But I think that some people would really enjoy it and I can understand why alot of people rated the book higher than I did but I personally didnt feel the book."
3,Future Sight,"George Orwell looked ahead in 1984 to a time when totalitarianism might rule society. Written in 1949, Orwell wanted to force people to think about the possibility, real in his mind, that a government-Big Brother-could control our thoughts and actions. So the actual 1984 has come and gone, and nothing happened quite like Orwell might have thought. Still the book gives us something to think about and somebody to watch out for. Be careful. Big Brother is watching."
2,"Slow, Boring, and Depressing","I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading ""The Partner"", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."
2,review for 1984,I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.
2,An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense,"I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."
3,prompt delivery,"This is the first time I have ordered a book online and was a little hesitant due to time restraints. My daughter needed George Orwell's 1984 for school and being unable to find it in a local bookstore, we tried ordering it off the internet. Supposedly delivery was delayed and we began to wonder if it would get here within 10 days for her deadline. The book arrived in 3 days in new condition and saved the day!"
2,The Most Boring Book I Ever Read,I think 1984 is not very interesting. The words are difficult. I had no clue what was really going on. It would be less boring if it was shorter and broken down so it would be easier to understand. You might like this book if you are interested in predicting the future and you can read lots of difficult words and know what they mean. Keep your dictionary close!
4,Good read,"I bought this for my wife as she really wanted to read this book. She loved the book and could hardly put it down. Just wish the price was a bit more affordable for a kindle book, but the convenience is really nice."
3,A little slow at times,This book is considered a Classic and I can understand why. However it is very slow in parts and is not a fast read. I recommend reading it at least once.
3,Middling,"Excellent insight into (and predictions about) abuse of technology by people in power--applicable to present-day governments--but the human-interest story (scare tactic) is lost in the stilted prose and the overuse of impersonal, third-person, dogmatic passages, running on for paragraphs."
1,"This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn","This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn..the condition is definitely NOT GOOD..Got this book for $4...It's not worth more than 25 cents for sure."
2,A Good Book but Not the Best!!,"This book is essentially the same as ""The Brave New World"" but expressed in a totally different way. Somehow, I like the ""The Brave New World"" better. It gave me a totally different view."
3,Very Strange,"OK very strange. It is about an imaginary future world where everyone is controlled and brainwashed to love and serve Big Brother. All humanness is removed through war, poverty, suffering, and torture to make the population zombie like and easy to manipulate. The language is changed and all records, books, etc are abolished. The story although strange is thought provoking and does bring into question the human min and what being alive really means."
3,1984-George Orwell,"Although the book (1984 by George Orwell) arrived in good condition as described, the book cover was not as pictured. This book has an updated cover which was shown on the website; the book we thought we were purchasing. Although the text reads the same, the print type is smaller therefore the page numbers are different between the two books. We purchased this book for classroom use thus making it difficult to follow when the instructor refers to certain passages because the page numbers are not the same."
4,Good but not great,"I think Orwell spent 2 much time on developing his world and his own language (new-speak) and not enough time on the story and chartacters. This is quite a simple book and very stright-foreward. The characters seem unrealistic and not very likeable, but his world is amazing in it's intricate structure. He planned out Oceania down to the very last detail, If only he had spent the same amount of time on the story and charactersthen This would have been a definite calssic, but as is, I still cannot say I found it as amazing as the other reviewers. But this is a great introduction to literature, just don't take it in a classroom setting as it kills the enjoyment of reading it"
4,good read,"The numerous references to this novel in pop culture make this a must read. In addition, the discussion in the afterword by Erich fromme was well informed added to the presence of this novel. I definitely recommend it."
1,1984,"1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
1,monotony,"Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
2,CONFUSING!!!,"I READ THE BOOK ""1984"" BY GEORGE ORWELL. tHE BOOK WAS ABOUT A GUY NAMED WINSTON WHO FOUND A DIARY AND WROTE HIS FEELING IN IT WHICH WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS RATHER BORING AND CONFUSING TO READ. I DIDNT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE THINGS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN READING THE BOOK I SUGGEST THAT YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY AND WONT BE CONFUSED."
1,I think this book is horrible,I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
1,Big Brother is Watching!,"George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
3,Chandra's Critical Review on 1984 by George Orwell,"In my World Literature class in high school, I chose to read the book 1984 as my lit. circle book. I didn't like this book very much. It was hard for me to understand, but I got through it. I also didn't like this book because it scared me a little about what the government can do right now. The book was interesting, but not the type of book I would normally pick to read. I don't recommend this book unless you like to read about ""Big Brother"" and the government watching you and knowing what you do."
3,A little outdated- but does convey a point,"Upon reading 1984 I found myself questioning many things about different economic and social societies. When George Orwell wrote this, ideas of Communism were just beginning to become known and many people questioned Capitalism. This is greatly reflected in the book. However, the so-called hero of the book, Winston, wasnt really a hero at all. In the end, he was brainwashed and lost his sense of individual thought. This was to prove to ""evils"" of not having Capitalism- The biggest problem with the book was that I feel it is outdated in that it does not have as great of an impact in our society today due to the increasing rise of Capitalism and the fall of several Communist countries. It presents a very extreme idea, but not a very likely one."
3,Over the Top,"I read this book for the first time after noting all the comparisons various friends and journalists have made between the system of government in the book and the system into which American government is evolving.But the book lacks subtlety and hits readers over the head with the details of tyranny. No doubt, Orwell writes this way to underscore the dangers of complete trust in government, but I find the plot to be so far fetched as to be unbelievable. NO form of government could ever gather the resources or achieve the efficiency needed to monitor each individual in the way the Party does. Wouldn't a more realistic cautionary tale be more effective and entertaining?"
3,"Very Depressing, But Makes You Think","I liked the idea of the book, but I hated it in the end. The hopeless feeling was important, and I think there are ideas to be learned from it, but I like a story where the human spirit triumphs. I like to read a book with heroism. This is fine for people who like bad endings, but it was not for me.There were also many elements that were not believable. Three totalitarian states would not constantly maintain equal power. A society such as Oceania would weaken and either one of the other states would gain supremacy, or another would rise up.I originally rated this book as 2 stars, but had to change it, because I can't stop thinking about it. Though I think some things could have been done differently, I have to say this book deeply affected me."
5,"Engrossing, horrific read","Wow is the first phrase that came to my mind after finishing this book. It is one of the best I have ever read and certainly my favorite read over the last year. I am sure everyone knows the plot by now so I will not rehash. But I knew the general plot beforehand i.e. ""Big Brother"" and the thought police, and I was STILL overwhelmed by 1984. Orwell's writing makes you keep coming back for more, always eager to find out how the current situation will turn out, and what will happen next. Besides the sketch of a tyrannical government using mass propaganda to literally brainwash its citizens, Orwell also shows how powerless the ordinary citizen becomes, how much trouble must be gone through to engage in illegal conduct, and how brutal the aftermath of getting caught is. And the love story, which I expected to be the weakest part of the book, is actually fascinating and heartbreaking. A Must-Read if there ever was one!"
4,Thought-provoking,"If you have not read this, I strongly recommend it ... ESPECIALLY if you are like me, and somehow ""escaped"" having this assigned to you either in high school or in college, but have always wondered what the hype was all about.Too many times today, you will hear this book discarded as a bunch of prophesies that were way off -- e.g., that in the year 1984 there would be computers and ""telescreens"" that would all but read our minds; that ""Big Brother"" would always be watching us. Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of ""Big Brother"" -- i.e., how information is ""cleansed"" to ""protect"" us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"
5,More than just entertaining...,There are many works where the story is the content. These books are usually for entertainment. This book uses the story to deliver its content. It uses the story to illustrate some awsome philosophical ideas. By presenting the ideas in a story they are easier to understand and they are more entertaining.I could not put the book down as I got towards the end. This is the only book I have ever read that has given me the shakes.
5,a must read,"one of the best books i've ever read. makes you think about what is true and what isn't. though written in the 50's i believe, the concept can be applied to the present and the future."
5,Amazing!,"This book was amazing! I've never read anything like it, not even other Orwell. After this I read every book and paper he'd ever published. An ominous vision of his future and our present."
4,21st century reading,It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world.
5,the 2nd best book ever,"this book was unstoppable!i couldnt put it down.i suddenly felt like i was being watched from everywhere just like the folks in the book.ive read it twice.the 1st time i was on winstons side but i learned to love big brother by the time i was done the 2nd time.big brother is watching!writer george orwell gets a lot of props for ""animal farm"" but this ones way better!"
3,Pretty good.,"I wonder what people in the early 50s thought of Orwell's view of the future. They must have thought it unimaginable, but to the current reader it appears to be less and less bizarre.I thought the book was well written and exciting for the most part, but it started to really drag when Winston started reading ""the book"". Overall I give 1984 three stars primarily because of the dragging toward end (I had to speed read some of it just to keep the pages turning), but also because the ending wasn't what I wanted--I can't fault him for that though.Good book."
3,"Good book so far, but the pages are annoying","The Centennial Edition of 1984 with the forward by Thomas Pynchon has ""deckled edges,"" which I personally find annoying. You can't flip the pages as easily. I ordered a replacement before realizing that the book was cut this way on purpose (it isn't mentioned or photographed on the detail page)."
5,Outstanding.,"This book is the most amazing, influential, disturbing, wonderful, and sickening, nightmarish, fantastic book I have ever read in my life.Don't read this review. Read the book. now, by whatever means."
5,Chilling Book!!!!,"It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong. Read this book and then take a look around, how close are we really?"
5,George Orwell : Modern Day Prophet,"It takes a lifetime to read this book. It's packed with symbolism and meaning. Few people will be able to absorb it all in one reading. Probably one of the Top Ten greatest literary works of all time. An excellent example of clear, concise, efficient use of the English language. Not one word out of place, not one word more or less than is needed. No 'Newspeak' in this book. It should be required reading for everyone who wants to live in a free society."
5,This book scared the living daylights out of me,"Orwell crafts one of the most absolutle horrors of a future world in this celebrated novel.Written in the late 40's, Orwell crafts the tale of a bureaucrat in the future whose job along with countless other mindless peons, is (in essence) to erase history.Bombarded by slogans that hammer the totalitarian nature of the state, he finds some comfort in a woman who shares his ambition to break free from the controls of ""Big Brother"".Parables abound in this book, to a world and people seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. Orwell has managed to create one of the most frigthening environments put to paper and weave a future world bleaker, but more importantly, theoreticaly possible in any day or age. So ingenious in usage of slogans, and terms made up by the author, that they are culturaly refered to still in this day and age.An astounding piece of fiction."
4,Buena. No apta para gente influenciable.,"En 1984 Orwell nos dibuja un panorama asolador. A pesar de la complejidad de los conceptos que quiere desarrollar (el proceso del doblepensar puede requerir un repaso para más de uno) los explica sencilllamente, de tal manera que no se podría haber escrito mejor. El panorama es tétrico, eso sí, con lo que no la recomiendo para mentes catastrofistas."
5,"Harrowing, thought-provoking, powerful",I just finished 1984 about a week ago and loved it. Orwell showed his maturity as a writer and his evolution from Animal Farm (also great). 1984 shows the force of totalitarian governments and the faults of human nature. This should be read by any progressive-minded persons in the world.
4,Ending,I was entertained throughout the book wiht orwell's vision of the future. Though I was unable to accept the ending. I was not convinced that Winston truly loved Big Brother. I felt that there was too muchh time skipped over and not enough leading up to his revelation.
5,A Dictionary for 2003,"Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how ""1984"" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery. On February 15 in New York, I saw a young man holding a poster with the ultimate reference to this great cautionary novel: ""1 + 1 = 2"". If you don't know what that's referring to, please read this book today."
2,Depressing,"Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950""s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. ""Cold Sassy Tree"" comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."
5,Horrifyingly prophetic,"Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world. Indeed, according to recent events, Big Brother is HERE and voting Republican."
4,definately a book for the intelligent reader,"In this book, George Orwell paints a very dark future for human kind in his novel 1984. One must wonder how accurate he is about this, society's future. He shows how a gov't can alter the past just as quickly as the present occurs and still maintain full power over it's people. Today is the world going in the direction that this book depicts, to the exact destination, or are we going the opposite way. One can only think and worry about this situation, but it does appear society is heading towards what Orwell wrote so many years ago. The people of Oceania in this book were governed by telescreens monitoring everybody's moves and giving them rules to abide by. This book depicts a communist gov't and a guess at how the future will be. I personally really enjoyed this book. It was one of the few books that kept my attention on every page. This is definately a book for the intelligent reader. END"
5,Amazing,"I read this book to kill some time at work, and I have to say that the time I ""killed"" was some of the best time I ever spent with any work of fiction. I would re-read this book in a heartbeat. This novel is one of the most worthy of five stars ever published.To all students: If this is a book you were assigned in a class, definately give this one a chance. You'll come out of the assignment with a new favorite novel, and thoughts and ideas that will challange and haunt you for weeks, if not years to come."
5,"If you read just 2 books, read the Bible, and this!","This book is extremely powerful. That isn't a secret. The power of this book is that this is now happening in the freeworld as it had been happening in radical dictatorships. First it was western europe in the 70's and 80's. Then it began in the US in the 90's during the Clinton's reign and the rise of the NSA and ATF. Now it is spreading because of Terrorism. The bottom line is that many in the governments in these free countries mean well but don't comprehend what is coming. The current Bush administration is just answering the call because of the power that technology has given our governments and global terrorist. We must either accept that we are always at risk or give up some of our freedoms. We just have to hope that when this risk dissapates, if ever, we can get them back. Lucky for us FDR died before he became king... If you think this is about facism you are thinking too liberal-1984 can occur in a pure democracy."
5,"If you only read one more book, read 1984","If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's ""1984.""Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the ""book-within-a-book"" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read ""1984"" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read ""Brave New World"" and ""The Probability Broach."" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (""Broach""). Then tell others what you have learned."
4,An excellent anti-utopian story,"Orwell writes a wonderfully disturbing story about totalitarianism. The characters were interesting and the story is a little creepy, but it is a fascinating read. And Orwell has a wonderful grasp of language. On the downside, the middle does drag on because it's more of a political treatise or arguement instead of a story."
4,predicting the future back then,Even read now--many years after 1984--some of the revaltions of this book hold scarily true. Big Brother vs personal freedom--a scary topic.
3,"1984 In a way, funny","The book 1984 by George Orwell was in a way funny. It was somewhat odd and mysterious, but it was funny. It was funny because of how George Orwell viewed the future. He described secret organizations. I believe that this book was very good literature, but it gave a weird outlook on the year 1984. As an example George Orwell writes,""Winston feared for his life that the thought police would track him down if he dared keep writing in the diary."" Even so for a person who loves reading about what could have been and the odd ways history could have happened, this George Orwell classic is all for you, and I recommend it. For those that prefer a more realistic novel, like me, aim for another author and book of your choice."
3,"A good read, but very depressing","This is one of the most depressing books I've ever read, but it does present an excellent discussion about conspiracy and power. I think that George Orwell had very little faith in mankind."
4,A Student's View (Village Academy),"After reading the book for the first time I was inspired by the vividness and characterization, and then after reading it for the second time I enjoyed the book just as much. The most striking feature of this book is that for some countries this type of totalitarian state is not to far into the future, which left a small, but apparent truth with me. Orwell was not trying to show what life in 1984 would be, but as a projection and exaggeration of tendencies and changes over the years. It would be a shame to miss out on this book no matter what."
3,Why is this a novel?,"1984 does not live up to it's reputation. I'll grant that Orwell had a point (that _western_ societies, as well as soviet society were headed toward his future). However, Orwell is not a great novelist -- excellent essays, poor novels. Almost the entire plot is stolen from an earlier russian work (We, by Yevgeny Zamyatin), which is far superior. If you're interested in Orwell's political thinking (yes, he's a socialist), check out his essays. If you're looking for a good allegory, DON'T get 1984..."
4,Orwells dark but good book,"George Orwell's, ""1984"", is a classic and detailed adventure that will leave you asking for more. The story is set in London where Winston, the main character, works for big brother. But he soon finds himself questioning Big Brother and how he works.For a while Winston tried to blend in with the crowd and not really stand out. But when Winston starts to remember his childhood, he begins to question Big Brother. Winston soon finds himself wondering what life was like before big brother. But unless he takes a real chance, he has no way of changing anything.One flaw I found with the book was its detail. I like a lot of detail, but this book overdid it. I would soon found myself thinking about other things and not the book."
4,Good science fiction,"I really liked this book. It is well written and it really made me think about the value of having privacy inside my own skull. It also made me wonder about how much of our free will IS free will and how much of it is manipulated. The story is fluid and easy to read. I seriously believe that this book is a must read, not only for science fiction lover but for everyone."
2,1984,"1984,by Georgee Orwell,is not fun to eat although cheese is. The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, ""Boring!"" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."
1,George had a good idea but the book really stunk.,"At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
2,"Fun, but historically innacurate","Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book."
1,BORING,This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it
2,BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS TEENS WELL ANYBODY,"Okay all this book was about was random sex, the destruction of human nature, and the ending of all morales. However I must admit that Orwell had a prphetic sense when it camr to the idea of being watched constantly by the government. This book lacked a decent plot as well. THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED."
2,I just couldn't get into it.,"This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it."
3,Love Story,"I viewed this book mainly as a pleasant romantic novel. But I found that the main character Winston was very arrogant and shallow though Orwell made sure that the character was very believable. Generally a very well thought out book, though some areas, such as when he is taken by the thought police are very simple and obvious and lacking in imagination. Anybody could have written that section, it lacked originality.However, I thought that the system of government was very well organised and well thought out and seems like an efficient and effective method of ruling. Although, very harsh and unfair and not something you would like to see in practise. Cold and harsh but effective.In conclusion a very romantic story that was upsetting in places. I cried when Julia was captured."
5,I read this in 1994 -- after visiting Russia,"I read this book in 1994, just after a trip to Byelorussia, Russia and Poland. Life under the Soviet regime must have been a nightmare. This book helped me appreciate what it must have been like."
5,the end is near!!! a ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!,"Just as high lord Orwell predicted, the world is at an apocalyptic state. Constant war, no privacy, thought police, the world is truly at its end. Though this lowly species has somehow managed to survive 15 years longer than lord Orwell predicted, surely this feeble race will extinguish itself because of its own greed and blind hatred. The contempt of the aristocrats has finally backfired as all knew it would. Creating ignorance and superficiality amongst the masses has finally gone too far, and there are no functional human beings left to survive. The contempt for nature and human ideals has led us to the brink of destruction, by our own hand."
5,A classic that should be read by all,"An excellent and horrifying view of a possible future for our world. Written in 1949, ""1984"" takes place in a future ruled by a rutheless and violent governemnt that watches all its citezins. The story's main character is Winston Smith, who's life is changed after buying an old journal and simply writing the words, ""DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER"" From there, paranoia turns into realised fear as everything Winston does makes him a target for the governments thought police, who are everywhere. Orwell does not hold back in his warning to the citezins of a free world of what may happen if one day we stopped watching ourselves and those who govern us. Don't take advantage of your feedom."
5,IT LEFT ME IN A SLEEPLESS DAZE,this is one of the greates books i have ever read it goes along with orwells great reputation of pplitical novles it left me wondering on how the human race is so week and breakable once you pass the first page you will not put it down till you finsh it
3,"Great book, Great Price, but not so great formatting","I loved this book, but to be honest, I didn't read it in this form because the text was tiny and it was thick and unapproachable. I would get a different publication of this book, because it is a great read, but I don't like this one. I listened to this one as an audiobook, and it was AMAZING--get the one read by Frank Mullins if you like audiobooks, it was fantastic. Loved it, and recommend that version over this one."
5,Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book,Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )
5,Life Altering,"Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Orwell's dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in London in a dictatoeship run by ""big brother"". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned. In this world smith somehow manages to fall in love.. and that's just the start of his problems.1984 warns us to be wary of those who might take our freedom whilst trying to convince us we are actually gaining extra liberty. Buy it."
3,1984,"Winston is a party member in a government that controls the very thoughts of its citizens. He works diligently until he falls in love with Julia. He ignors his duties and disobeys his society. They find freedom for a while, but will it last? The society in the book is interesting and depressing, too. The characters have believable personalities. If you like happy books don't read it though. It's depressing and politcal but well written."
3,"Depressing,but Enlightening","The dismal,totalitarian way of life in Orwell's 1984 was very sad and seemed very discouraging when one comes to realize that much of what was foretold had already come to pass.Yet,we don't live in a Concentration Camplike society yet,and many of them have vanished.Like Orwell's other great book,Animal Farm,or even Wells' The Time Machine,this paints a picture of society as it might be if certain directions were taken.And like good satire should,it alerts us to make sure these directions aren't taken."
3,"slow at first, keep reading and it gets better","1984 was by far one of the wierdest books i've ever read, but being a younger reader and this book being one of the first real science fiction novels itwas pretty good. I had to read this book as part of my summer reading list, and i had to read to page 50 and start over because i was confused. When i started to get into it it was a pretty good book. i usally rate books on if i am hooked on the first 5 pages, i still wasn't hooked on this one until way passed the 5th chapter. This was my first book by George Orwell, i am going to try some more of his work and then have a better picture of the writing he does."
3,"A book I admire, but don't particularly like","1984 is the kind of book that I admire more than like. I admire Orwell for how detailed and believable the world he builds is. For his efforts to set a dark and unsettling mood and for his detailed analysis of its politics.The reasons I don't like it as much as so many other people? Well, it didn't do anything for me. I couldn't relate or feel anything for the characters. I didn't find the story haunting or particularly appealing. It didn't even make me think, when I was reading books like Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 or Camus' The Fall I had to close every few pages to think about it, because I couldn't hold my thoughts back, with 1984 this didn't happen at all.Reading it's a subjective experience, no matter how good a book is, if you don't feel anything as a result of reading it, why then give it a high rating?I wish I'd liked it better, or at least spotted any major reason for my dislike, but I didn't."
3,"The main idea of the book is good, but the book itself is not interesting...","Sorry if I contribute to lowering the score for this classic, but although the main idea is good, the writing is simplistic (reads like a book for teenagers) and the story and characters lack depth and are quite boring.I guess I'm disappointed that Orwell didn't do a better job with such a brilliant idea... The only part that was really interesting to me is when his main character, Winston, is reading from the ""prohibited"" book. In this section, Orwell essentially details the philosophy of the party leaders, and that's a very stimulating read. But apart from this segment, the story is mostly pointless."
4,"Oustanding warning to us in the future, from back in 1948-49. Orwell's best novel!","Eric A Blair did us all a favor back in1948-49 when he wrote this politicalnovel about future tyranical society.Followed by Animal Farm, another winner.Most of what Orwell predicted has/will(but I hope not) come true. Only our Con-stitution can stop it, if Mr. and Mrs.America would/will wake up!"
5,"Much better than ""Brave New World""","Although Brave New World has been written before Orwell's masterpiece - which is the great merit of Aldous Huxley - and these books show different views of the future, I consider 1984 much more mature than the other. When I started to read it, I couldn't stop. It's intelligent, interesting and VERY well written. Besides, it deals with many, many issues, not only totalitarism, as people use to say. It deals also with loneliness, mass media and the power of verbal language. I really like Orwell's description of a profesional ""building"" a new language, a language so limited that would control human's thought. George Orwell was very inspired when he wrote this book. Congratulations to this sensitive writer."
3,A disturbing and haunting book for young people,"This is a book that I had first read as a young teen as a Freshman in High School. The main character is emotionally bonding. In the end, he is tortured into breaking his integrity to his true love. ""Do it to Gloria,"" the words still ring in my ears 30 years later. This is a disturbing book to the first degree."
3,Unsettling,"1984 is one of those novels I have intended to read for years, and had never gotten around to. However, I finally managed to get to it, for better or for worse. Orwell's dystopian novel has left me feeling rather prosaic, and I'm not quite sure how to express my feelings regarding the text. In the simplest terms, I didn't like the novel; but I don't think I was supposed to. And I certainly don't regret taking the time to read it."
4,Thrilling and surprising,"1984 can do without my review I suppose, it's been around for more than 50 years and it's a classic. So that means you must read it! Unless you are very sensitive, because some of the tortures described leave you with a strong sense of impotence. The book also has very surprising and unexpected plot changes."
3,Anti-climactic,"I've heard alot of things about this book, mostly what friends that have read the book have told me. I was looking to compare it to the blind ideaology of human nature. I found alot of what I was looking for in the human psyche but I was quite disappointed with the book as a literary piece. The using of very colorful expressions of the english language but anti-climactic left me feeling ripped-off. The cliftnotes would've done just as well."
3,Over Rated; Over Didactic; Over the Top.,"This book is very good as a piece of propaganda. It fails as a gripping story. I found Aldous Huxley's Brave New World a far more compelling read, or if you want a real dystopean nightmare try Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegutt. 1984 starts well, but by the final chapters it seems we are reading Orwell's own anti totalitarean attitudes and the story has been left to the side. This book is worth reading, but I wouldn't accept other reviewers comments that this is the best book in the world."
2,doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews,this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book. I was excited to read it before amazon.com stole it.
2,to future ap worlld history students,"I honestly dont like this book its just not the type of stuff i like to read. So any of you that are thinking about reading this if your favorite book is the twilight series, eragon or the vampire diaries you probably wont like it either. I only read it because i had to."
1,disappointed,i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve
5,Best book I have ever read,"To this day, no other novel has changed the way I look at society as George Orwell has done with ""1984."" I highly recommend this book."
3,School neccessity,I enjoyed the book somewhat. It has plenty of current day predictions of invetions. My son needed it for a school read.
2,Orwell....just a little too far out there for me.,"I thought George Orwell's 1984 was an ""ok"" book. I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people. So just because I didn't think the book was that fantastic, don't let that stop you. I would advise you to read this book to see if Orwell's depiction of this strange negative utopia is for you."
3,1984...,"1984 by George Orwell is a very interesting book. Why? because of his unique way of writeing and his views of what life would be like in 1984. The book does, however get boring. Eben though the book seems boring and uneventful you should continue reading, because it gets more exciting the further you read. The story opens with the main character Winston Smith and he describes several of the things he sees, such as the bizarre letters or words he sees on walls. Later in the book he meets and finds love in a girl named Julia. They join a secret organization called the Brotherhood to try and over throw the government which they hate. The book continues with their expierences in the brotherhood and the troubles they run into."
2,Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...,"OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card."
2,bad service,really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers.
3,1894 review,"Was a good book, but could have PLENTY of more features like an appendix or quotes and synopsis added. Otherwise, a good book, 1894 is a masterpiece from Orwell."
2,1984,"I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time."
5,Classic Message in a Modern World,"Winston lives in a world of constant survelence and secret police. Truth is what the government says, not what actually happened. According to the ""facts"" produced by the government, the country is getting better, but according to memory, the country is getting worse. Society has been brainwashed by fear of its own government and also by incited anger at its enemy country.1984 yields the (very) far extreme of a society that many fear some current societies are headed. Although fiction, it is fascinating to look at certain similar aspects to current societies (again, nowhere near as extreme as the book's society), and is a good book in terms of where we should keep our society from heading. Truly a great read in terms of perspective.The only downside that I took from the book was that I was so bothered by what Winston endured and especially the last 50 pages of the book. Never a regret reading it, but definitely not a ""happy book."" I like my eyes wide open."
5,1984 - A Book About the Future,"What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's dark. It's real dark. It's real, real dark. Get your flashlight. The future is not a nice place and this is no fairytale. It is, however, a classic and a must read."
3,1984... kind of depressing,"I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still ""trying"" to read it. It's depressing and the theme is kind of old, so I'm not that enthusiast with it. I was born abroad and this was not a required reading material while I was in school. I'm just very happy that I've never lived in a place like that. Hope it gets better towards the end."
5,Masterpiece of Satire,"I believe there are some people--many of whom are artists-- who arrive on this earth to warn us of the future. George Orwell--a Humanistic Socialist--is one of those people. I write in the present tense because although Mr. Orwell has left us, his masterpiece works such as 1984 and Animal Farm, remain, and probably will--as all great artistic works--for a very long time.The warning that 1984 represents is that of impending dystopia--evil in its abject, Senseless, Self-Serving brutality--that threatens to take hold of our human society whenever people become complacent. The question is will we heed the warnings and begin taking responsibility for creating heaven on earth-- or will we wallow in this dangerous complacency and thereby enable the bullies to take over for the sheer love of power?"
4,A haunting blueprint for oppression,"This book is a great read, but is also quite disheartening. The society described in the book is inconceivable to some, but it's hard to argue that we aren't moving in that direction. I challenge anyone to disagree after reading this with an open mind.The highlight of the book is a manifesto that the main character, Winston Smith, must read. It shows Orwell's ingenious insight to mankind's role in it's own oppression. I couldn't help but agree with so much of what was said, at the same time realizing how much it seemed to trivialize the work of all civil rights activists.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoyed stories such as ""V for Vendetta"" or movies like ""American History X"" and ""The Matrix""."
4,A warning of events to come,"1984, written in the late 1940's, is a shocking look at a possible future. This future is one where independant thought is outlawed and ""Big Brother"" rules over the people of Oceania with an iron fist. One man stands up against this totalitarian government. Can he topple Big Brother, or will he be one who falls? This book really makes the reader THINK while they read. Today, with our ever-expanding government, this future is not a far-fetched possibility. Do not take this book so much as an entertaining novel, but rather as a warning of events to come."
4,Just the book your looking for?,"1984 is a book based on the main character Winston Smith. Winston lives in a Oceania which is controlled by a totalitarian government, big brother. Big Brother has become so bad that the government has come up with their own language and have many devices to monitor them daily.George Orwell went about conducting 1984 very well in my eyes. This book is a pretty easy read and it really gets you thinking about some things. What if something like this ever happend? What if we weren't born in the U.S.A. and we were controlled like that all the time? By Orwell even being able to put that sort of image into somebodies mind shows and proves how good of a writer he really is."
4,Great Book,"1984 is definitely a book that can generate discussion. The topics form strong and sometimes unexpected opinions. A few parts are a bit dull, such as the beginning, but the plot is quite intriguing. George Orwell utilizes superior language and I loved the way he used one example of ""mind control"" throughout the entire story and ties up loose ends with the concept. MAny different themes are all taking place at the same time, but everything associates with the main ""Big Brother"" government. I truly enjoyed reading the novel. It was a refreshing change of pace for me because I'm not normally a science fiction reader. Despite all of this, I wouldn't suggest knocking this book off in one sitting, even if you're an avid reader. It can get pretty hard to focus. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend 1984."
4,It was a good book with an unfortunate ending.,"The entire book was good up until the last chapter, at least in my opinion. Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try. However, the book was well put together overall with very strong characters and a strong plot. It's scary if ""Oceania"" ever became the world of today."
2,Not such a hot book,"As is the custom of Barth, this book is informative but incredibly boring. The story of the Basseri is detailed and interesting but Barth has a style all his own and to say the least it is not engaging."
3,Holly's more girl than most females!,"This book is interesting and at times very funny, but don't expect anything too shocking. I reccomend this if you are into Andy Warhol's Factory or drag queens."
4,Uncanny,Another great read by Jack Polidoro. Unbelievably uncanny that not too long after reading Project Samuel there is all the bruhaha over what to do with Ted Williams' body after his death. A riveting novel! It is scary to see what could and does happen because of human greed. Jack does a remarkable job of allowing the reader to get to intimately know the characters. Once again I anxiously await Jack's next novel.
4,Spellbinding fantasy,"The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through. The author's love of baseball and it's heros is evident. I couldn't put it down, had to rush to the very satisfying finish. Looking forward to more from Polidoro."
2,leaves streaks - do not cover effectively,I am disappointed with this product.It is very cakey and do not cover blemishes more then my regular make up.It leaves streaks which looks really unattractive.I also find it hard to apply.
2,not to good,doent cover goo at all to me very light coverage wont buy it again sorry to say good day.. bye
5,Covers Redness,Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea. It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.
4,The best coverage ever,"I really like this concealer. It covers better than any other I've ever tried and stays on until I wash it off. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does tend to get a bit cakey. I primarily got it for dark under eye circles. Be careful to put it on in light, thin layers around the eye area. I have a small scar on my cheek and this covers it completely. A little bit goes a long way, too."
4,Won't ever be without this product!,I've been using this product for a few years now and cannot imagine ever being without it. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and the difference after applying this product is remarkable. I HIGHLY recommend it.
4,Complete Coverage,I've been using this product for a couple of years now. I've tried other products but have always came back as nothing else covers imprefections as well. Can be a bit chalky if you don't blend well and only use as a cover-up and not a full face foundation.
5,coverblend concealer,Product covers my black allery eye circles perfectly without drying the eye area; it stays until you wash it away.
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE CONCEALER. DOES NOT CREASE AT ALL. COVERAGE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER, BUT STILL A GREAT PRODUCT."
4,love it!,"I always have a hard time finding a concealer that is just right. But this concealer I found years ago, and I've been using it ever since! I have dark bags under my eyes and this concealer helps lighten them up. Definitely recommend it!"
4,Great coverage,Very effective product and cost effective. The smallest amount of this concealer covers under eyes and stays put. Creases a bit but not as much as some other products that give less coverage.
2,I'm probably doing something wrong. =(,"I have yet to find a concealer that I am happy with. I have really dark under eye circles and this does camouflage them somewhat, but not how I had hoped. Instead of covering them, it seems to change their shade. Kind of like as if I were painting and rubbed white paint on a black spot, turning it grey. Get what I mean? It also looks really CAKEY! It could be because I have really dry skin, but not even with moisturizer + primer does it stop looking cakey.I'm returning this for my money back. That's primarily why I bought it here. I'm going to try Eve Pearl's salmon concealer in my shade, as well as Shiseido's concealer. Hopefully I'll find one I like."
5,brilliant,"i suffer from severe skin discoloration and i cant tell you how good this product is at hiding most if not all of it. For those people who have issues relating to skin, pls try this as it is by far one of the best concealers i have come across....."
1,What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6,The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
2,Wait for a Better Release,"As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided. There are still some channels broadcasting the series and even though they are the cut-up syndicated version, it was better than what I bought. Wait for someone responsible like Shout Factory to do it right.Try Hulu, it may be there."
2,Great for native japanese speakers,"First I have to say I am disappointed that I ended up buying a Drama Audio CD instead of a OST. While I love the Karin Anime, spending the money on something I do not fully understand is a bit aggravating.All that aside, I'm sure the CD will be a treat to listen to. It unfortunately means my imagination will be in overdrive most of the time trying to create some semblance of what is happening.If you are a devoted Karin fan who likes collecting Japanese Audio Drama CDs, this is for you.If you're looking for the actual Background Music to the Karin series, you'll have to look elsewhere. You could start with www.play-asia.com. However, with Amazon.com always updating and changing, you may be able to find what you're looking for.Enjoy! ^_^"
3,Wenzel battery fan review,"It is tinier than I thought, but will be okay in our tented room for the summer. It will keep cool about two people at a time. I thought it was lareger."
2,Weak compared to the competition,"Pros: Uses 6 AA batteries which gives it a long life (about 9 hours with NiMH rechargables) in a fairly compact size. I did not see the problems that others have reported with the light not turning off or shoddy construction.Cons: The breeze it produces is fairly weak and diffuse. It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5"" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters. I thought the built-in light on the Wenzel would be nice but it seems that I usually don't want the fan and light pointing in the same direction. It would make more sense to have a separate light."
2,"CRAPPY FAN, DECENT LIGHT....","I ordered this fan for a recent camping trip, and never got to use the fan. I had it set up at the foot of my inflatable mattress, and one of my kids tipped it over accidentally. The fan detached from it's base, and I wasn't going to perform surgery on it during my vacation. The light on it is pretty bright, and we did use it throughout the trip. I'm sure there are much better, more durable fans out there."
1,A Real Disappointment,"This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment."
2,It hardly puts out any air,I can't recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn't actually get any thing done. Well if i had to say some thing nice about it that would be it has a nice LED light in there. So in conclusion don't waste your money on this product get a better reviewed one instead.
1,DON'T BUY,"This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!"
4,Good Gun case,"Pretty good gun case. I use it to hold 2 handguns and a kel-tec sub 2000(small rifle that folds in half). I can put all the guns on the top level then all the magazines and other items on the bottom level. Case closes tight and nothing moves around. The only bad is that the locks are useless, the key dose not fit well and it is hard to lock/unlock. I have just stopped using the lock, which would be a problem around children."
2,pathetic,"Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her."
1,Pointless Movie!!,"I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
1,Movie sucks,This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
1,Save your money.,"I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible."
1,one of the worst Cannes winners,"That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
1,The Worst Movie Of All Time,"This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."
2,Not What I Expected Or Even Close,The acting was good for what it was. The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was. The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.
2,Misses the Mark,"I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these ""critically acclaimed"" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying ""What?"""
5,Don't you get it?,"What a brilliant movie about incest and how it leads to the devastation of a woman. A woman who can't feel anything, who is trying desperately in every way to feel...something. And when someone presents himself to draw her out of her withered self, all she can do is re-enact her adoloscent despair. Come on, folks -- her mother tells her she's filthy, she berates her for giving in to a man -- this is Psychology 101, but brilliantly acted and compelling. Of course, she wants her student to be damaged, because she is both jealous and trying to protect her student from her overbearing parents. I doubt that I'm going to sleep well tonight."
2,Quite funny,"Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John."
1,Pretentious bore,"Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie."
3,Distubing,"I just watched this film and feel as if I need a shower. This is an emotionally drainiing film about two very sick and twisted people: the mother and the daughter. The mother is like Mama Rose in Gypsy, totally focused on her daughter and unwilling or unable to let her go. The daughter is so damaged she cannot break away from her mother and at the same time is sexually repressed and turns to porno to relieve her repression. But it really doesn't release her. At times I felt like strangling that mother but that mother is so sick I felt ashamed at how I felt.This film will stick with you, whether you like it or not and I'm not sure. I watched it through until the end (which means I didn't hate it or I would have walked away). Isabelle Huppert is magnificent (as she always is) and no one plays a repressed woman on the verge of eruption (see La Ceremonie).Even her feelings about Schubert are twisted.I still would say it's worth a rental. You will not forget this movie, I promise."
5,now this is a great psychological portrait,"Bound to become a classic of world cinema, 'the piano teacher', is Michael Haneke's most perfect film.. It tells the story of a women so repressed and abused by her mother that she explodes with sexual tension..it comes out in her music.. and in a sort of chaotic relationship with one of her students.. at times incestuous and at times perverse this is a truly disturbed women who is as rigid as her own philosophy of music- this is a must see - a modern classic from a powerful new cinematic voice.."
3,unconvincing,"Despite a superb performance from Huppert the movie as a whole simply doesn't hold water. Her repression at the hands of her mother (another great performance) is very well done but I didn't buy the tenor of her relationship with the young ""genius"". And the ending is a rather strained copout. Nevertheless, very interesting movie with some excellent acting. Unfortunately, the interview with Isabelle throws absolutely no light on her character - she must be a brilliant instinctive actress."
4,real Good Film,got to see this Film recently&I didn't find it near as Strong overall as it was advertised as being.it had some twisted moments&elements going on but overall not that different from what I've seen in film over the past several years.enjoyed the music&overall chemistry.
2,I think I'll go back and hide behind Clementi,"I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music. I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was."
4,Mostly quite good.,"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better."
3,Dog Tutu,"Very cute, but sized for small dogs; the XL size was too small for my 80 lb. Golden, and I returned it to the vendor"
5,"more people should see this dvd! if your unaware ,buy it. amazing insight","Excellent dvd! gives insight to a scociety that created a major movement of last century. many of these techniques have carried on through other inovators, but we will surely cherish this dvd and use it as a resource.[...]"
5,"Like silky, velvet dreams","The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea."
2,"It's not evil, it's just pretty boring","Giving Sarah a lift from Loch Ness to London, the TARDIS picks up a distress signal and the Doctor lands the ship on Zeta Minor, a planet on the very edge of the universe. On this planet, an expedition seeking a new energy source has lost all but one of its members.However, when the Morestran Empire rescue expedition arrives, the Doctor and Sarah are prime suspects as the mysterious killers. But the planet has a very large secret, one which threatens the whole universe...'The Planet of Evil' is one of those Doctor Who serials that so many people seem to love, but which leaves me cold (perhaps not a surprise, as it was written by Louis Marks, who also wrote 'Inferno', which falls into the same category. Novelisation hasn't greatly improved the story in my eyes, and deprives us of the wonderful Zeta Minor jungle set.If you like 'Inferno', you'll probably like this one far more than me."
5,"Put it out on DVD,PLEASE","See my review of this movie on vhs.Some day before I'm dead,maybe this will come out on dvd.If you want this movie out on dvdthen click yes."
4,Heartwarming and thought-provoking; pure enjoyment,"Although it is difficult at first to picture Alec Guinness as a distinguished Tokyo businessman, you soon begin to accept his character. I was skeptical of this movie when instructed to view it by my mother. However, just a few minutes into the story, I found myself hooked. Rosalind Russell is believable as the wise and loving Mrs. Jacoby. Alec Guiness is an acceptable post WWII Japanese business man although you want to tell him to quit squinting. Overall, the movie is a guilty pleasure on a cold or rainy Saturday afternoon."
1,Beware DVD-R copies,"This is the second time I have ordered a movie manufactured ""on demand"" in a DVD-R format from Amazon.com. My Sony DVD recorder/player is less than two years old. When I attempted to play each movie on the Sony, this message was displayed: ""Error. This disk cannot be played"". I have never had problems with movies that are manufactured directly by the studio so I assume that the middleman responsible for making these DVD-R copies is unreliable. Anyway, I am very disappointed."
1,A Majority of One DVD-R movie,"If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One"
5,"""A Majority of one""","I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
4,Variedad,"Bueno tener este album debido a su sonido peculiar, algunas de sus canciones hasta fueron programadas aca en la radio en Guanatos...es + el Kala (Rostros Ocultos) se encargó de hacer un cover el cual fue un exito en español - con los Smithreens nunca lo fue - (""Tiempo de Cambiar"" o ""Something New""). Saludos de neta. Mork"
3,Laudable effort fails to grasp arcanum,"Tuneful, guitar-oriented power-pop without a thought in its head other than getting to the next great hook-laden chorus -- which most times, unfortunately, just ain't as great or hook-laden as it oughta be, given ersatz-Top 40 format. Borrows heavily from British Invasion greats, though not remotely in same league; still, entertaining on its own limited terms. Guranteed you'll end up pining for the real thing -- Unit 4 + 2 or Gerry, let alone the Yardbirds, Pretty Things, or _Kinks_, for cryin' out loud. (And don't that particularly golden pop-music heyday look more like some divine abberation with each passing year?)"
4,Great Romantic Piano Etudes,"Felix Blumenfeld writes etudes in the grand nineteenth century tradition, and they are worth hearing and playing. The performances on this CD are technically expert and musically satisfying."
1,Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children,This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.

4,Cute New Children's Book for Valentine's Day,"Louanne Pig is ecstatic when she receives a Valentine's Day card from a secret admirer. However, she is now faced with trying to un-mask her admirer, so she can thank him in person. After all, having a secret admirer is very exciting. So Louanne sets out on her quest to find her admirer, but it's harder than it looks, and Louanne keeps hitting dead ends.

4,Not just for Valentine's Day,"Louanne the pig has an age-old problem: She's received a beautiful valentine from an unidentified admirer! Whimsical drawings accompany her search through all her classmates, and the ending is sweet enough for those to young to appreciate boy-girl romance."
1,"More like ""Tower of Feces""!!!","This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,neutroggena visibly firm body lotion,"I loved this product!I was burned twice on my face and this was the one product that I have ever needed for my face,I didnt need makeup my skin always was soft and firm looking,now I cant find anything to compare and my skin has been rough and very dry.They sell less for way more,the more was better cause I used it even on my belly and legs.I miss it...."
2,Need to proof read your work,This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
2,not proof read,This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book.
3,Just ok,I bought this for my wife to use and she only liked it ok. The fit was just ok and she said she couldn't hear that great with it. The functionality was ok. I was thinking about getting me one but after her expereince I went with a Jawbone
1,Doesn't warm bottles,"Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product."
2,to long to warm,"where to begin, this product takes atleast 10 to 15 minutes to warm up a 4ounce bottle, and anyone with a small infant that is hungry knows this is entirely to long, would not recomment this to new parents at all, I now take a reusable bottle and fill with hot water and use that to warm up bottles"
1,it is a joke,"this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
1,NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER,"hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again."
2,Don't overheat your bottle!,"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer."
1,I'd pass on this one,"This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!"
1,Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles,I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
1,So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!,Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
3,OK for light-weight use,"Under the heading ""You get what you pay for"", this tool does an adequate job. Recommend getting aluminum rivets to use in place of the steel rivets provided. There is a trick to using the hand squeeze, so read the instructions or else you'll end up disassembling the gripper section several times as I did! I think I would give this tool one more star if I had had prior experience using a pop riveter.Regards,ABC"
4,Chilling & Fast Paced,"As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox & Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller."
2,"My daughter think this is fun,but not that fun","I bought this for my daugher on her birthday she liked the doll, but she did not love it. She said, ""it was fun she enjoyed doing her hair,but it was not hat fun."""
3,Good toy for very young kids.,Beautiful and fun for very young girls (5-7 years). They can learn how to use a player and have some fun without breaking and expensive iPod unit you could save to buy them later.
5,May I borrow your Penquin?,"Not only is this 5 stars, it should get a rosette in the Peguin catalogue.It's simply the best since the 1970's superb Emi recordings. Thanks Emi for putting all this material on one disc. Mr Cleobury's has directed this music in a somewhat faster pace than the 70's versions, thus rendering these works absolutely fun to listen to, especially the ""Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem"". It's just astonishing. I've followed Purcell recordings since Yehudi Menuhin, Schwartzkof...Baker...Britten...Deller Consort...James Bowman...Elloit Gardiner...Will Christie..I am quiet intimate with Purcell. And, this one stands right up there with the best of them. Intense, passionate and very singable. This one could revive the Purcell Society or maybe, even start one in the states."
3,Cali is Active is a good album,"Cali is Active ***1/2 StarsThis is a very good album by the dogg pound and a very decent one for the west coast who has recovered nicely, there is some flaws on this one, but the rest is just good old fashion west coast cali magic in this thing.Thumbs Up."
5,DA WEST IS COMING BACK,"IN MY OPINION THA DOGG POUND IS MAKING A GREAT MOVEMENT....ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN PUTTIN THIS MANY ALBUMS OUT. WE HAVE ""THE GAME"" , ""ICE CUBE"" AND MANY MORE STILL TO COME....IN MY OPINION THA DOGG POUND IS DOING GREAT THINGS....SO IM SAYIN IF YOU GONNA GET THIS ALBUM PREPARE TO BE AMAZED"
1,Cali iz inactive,"Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album."
1,title track was cool&then the rest is a Coaster,"Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but they lost there Groove long ago. the flows are tired&there are too many hands on the Production end. seems to be going through the motions&hoping to catch somebody feeling the vibe,but you just can't recapture where things were at back in the day. Snoop is just hall passing these days so him being on cruise control here comes as no suprise."
3,Cali Is Active - DPG,"I would like to start by saying that this is my 2nd album i bought by DPG. the first one was ""The Saga Continues"" and that album was much better than this.""Cali is active"" got some great outstanding beats and guest appearances are great but still something is missing!!!? the old Kurupt spit some hot s**t on the previous album but on this album he sounds like he's tired of rapping. his lyrics sometimes are at peak but most of the time they are off beat. Daz got some nice verses but like Kurupt, he sounds like he's not even trying.If u a hardcore fan of DPG then buy the album, if not then buy their previous album ""Daz & Kurupt 2: The Saga Continues""!"
2,Save your money,"I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped."
2,Don't bother buying this one,"After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a ""menu decoder"" when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books. Try to find something else."
3,Not complete,"I bought this book for my trip to Thailand next winter, so I have not put it into practice yet.However, Thai is a tonal language, and this book does not indicate what tones one is to use when pronouncing a word."
2,"It really had potential, but....","Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."
3,"Good, but mostly because of parts, not the whole","I enjoyed the setting and details of this book. BDSM folks will really enjoy the beginning of the novel. It could easily have made a great book by just staying on the island. Once the characters leave to New Oleans, I felt the book kind of fell apart. The ending is poor and leaves you wanting to return to the island of slaves. I'd say buy to book for the beginning parts but don't expect those yummy parts to last throughout the book to the end. It loses momentum and ends without any sort of bang. Disappointing, but I still recommend it nevertheless."
4,Good Book!,"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own. If you are a fan, I would recommend adding this one."
3,I GUESS IT WAS A OKAY READ,"Exit To Eden was a okay read for me. It had a very dark and strong tone. I must say it kept me wanting to read on in the first few chapters.....However, somewhere in the middle of the book it lost me. But, I figured if I paid for it might as well keep on reading.The book is not for everyone just like everything else in life. Personally I don't think it was better than Fifty Shades of Grey. Can't wait for the movie!"
3,Not quite what I expected,I gotta say that I was a little bit dissapointed in this book. I really liked the descriptions of the places and how colorful and vivid it all seemed. The part that made me dissapointed was when they left the island. The woman was a basket case and was very rude to people for little to no reason and I don't see how the men would have ever truly tolerated that. Once the left the island and the resort it went down hill and I found myself wishing for the rest of the book that they would go back and I was waiting for that moment and it never came. It was good but certainly not great.
4,"Atmospheric, kinky, memorable...","...and besides all that, the writing is gorgeous, and the New Orleans settings are so wonderful. Ann Rice is truly a writer of many talents - and many and diverse interests.Kinky? Yes. Erotic? Yes? Fun? Yes. Should you read it? Yes."
5,Excellent!,"Movie was okay, I liked it. Never realized there was a book for it. I was buying more Anne Rice's books and saw Exit to Eden, I picked it up knowing if Anne Rice wrote it, it would be good. But... it was even better! A MUST READ! It was completely different than the movie! But totally BETTER! I recommend this book with no problem. You must be open-minded. I like the fact it went from The Club to real-life. I have read most reviews. I agree with people saying its the best. For those who say it ""trash,"" you may need to open your eyes and see the true world out there. It's not the 50's anymore. You have your opinions, but I have mine and this is an EXCELLENT BOOK TO READ. I have read the Witching Hour and the books to follow for the series. Anne Rice continues to amaze me with her works, specially considering this is a earlier written book! Amazing. Read it!"
4,"Nothing Like the ""Movie Version""","[close] I was one of the fortunate people who was able to read this book before the film came out. I would like to open by stating that if you liked the ""movie"" starring Rosie O'Donnell, DO NOT READ THE BOOK. Likewise, if you read the book, avoid the movie like you would avoid a rabid dog showing signs of ebola.This is not Rice's greatest erotic work. It lacks the expansiveness of the Beauty trilogy or the vividness of Belinda. Those facts aside, this is an interesting work from a psychological standpoint (understanding the ""top"" and ""bottom"" or ""Master/Mistress"" ""slave"" relationships), and not a bad read for its sexual content and scenes. However, it is not the pathetic, vaguely slapstick comedy that the film made it into, and is nowhere near the quality of most of her other work."
5,Completely changed my life,"A friend recommended this book to me. Once I started, I couldn't put it down - it captured so many ideas I'd already been thinking. I then gave it to my wife, who, to my surprise, also loved. Needless to say, it has completely changed our lives for the better."
5,Wonderfully Erotic,"I was not able to put this book down. If you have ever been interested in s/m, you must read this. Anne takes you to the point of being sexually submissive like no one ever will!"
3,A romantic s&m book,"I just need to say that this book started out quite s&m like. Full of exciting sexual happenings.... but ended up as being just a really good 'happily ever after' story. Theres nothing wrong in that, because mind you i loved the romantic side to the story, it was beautiful. But it would seem that after the first few chapters, the whole s&m or Master/slave aspects were just totally lost and gone. And if you've read the 'Beauty Series' by Anne Rice that is probably why you picked up this book. Well if you are hoping for something as satisfying as the Beauty series then you've chosen the wrong book. If you are into reading love stories and love to see happy endings where people run away and fall in love, then your in luck!"
4,Good - maybe not 5 stars but still good.,"I have read so much about Anne Rice - and finally managed to read one of her books - since I dislike anything with vampires thought I would give this a try. All I have to say is ""where is the Club?"" and where can I meet a man like Elliott?? wow! This is a very sensual tale about two people Lisa and Elliott who have enjoyed to the hilt such a heavy dose of an alternative s&m life style but when this couple finally meet - PASSION!! Much more powerful and intense for both of them than they have ever experienced. They both find themselves willing to risk anything to persue this opportunity with ""love."" Rice actually allows you to see them fall in love in their flight from the Club. This is a strong powerful book and I found it a page turner."
2,Not what I expected,"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."
3,"Not her best, but good","The concept of the story, the ""S/M Club Med"" was an interesting one, but didn't seem to be taken to it's full potential. A good story of the relationship between the two main characters gets mired between not knowing if it should be an erotic novel or a harlequin romance. Her sexual writing is more vanilla than in her other writings (Beauty series, etc.) and she never gets to heavily involved in the sex scenes. The lack of attention to the sexual parts and the confusion of what it was meant to be is what keeps it from a higher rating. It is a good read however, if you don't expect too much from it but a good ""human"" story"
4,Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD,"A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!"
3,Not exactly as real BDSM is done but an ok fantasy,"This is one of those times when I have to say: the movie was better than the book. I say this for two reasons. The first is my own personal dislike of any fiction that protrays rape as a precusor to a loving relationship and there are a few rapes in this book. The second is that I'm an educator who works with a university and a student organization to promote and explain BDSM as viable form of sexuality. While I'd happily recommend seeing the movie version, I'd be hestitant to say to a newbie ""watch this"" for fear they might think the book is reflecting an actual BDSM relationship. A complaint I've heard about the book is not true: The main characters do not say they give up SM at the end; instead it is greatly downplayed leading to the common assumption that SM is seen as inferior to vanilla."
3,Fluff and Stuff,"I can't really say that I liked this one. But honestly, it was about what I expected. I bought this because I like Anne Rice, but I'm not really into the subject matter. I think she went off on a tangent here. But if you like that sort of thing, you will like this book. The middle to last part of the book was much more interesting to me than the Club Scene detailed in part one. All in all, if you are into S&M then this book might interest you. If not, you might want to skip it."
2,One erotic passage in the entire book.,"I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the ""Club"". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."
2,I was extremely disappointed!,"The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it."
2,One Of The Worst Anne Rice Books!,"I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!"
1,Not what I expected...,"This book wasn't what I expected; never read an Anne Rice, but after reading what others had written, thought I'd buy a book of hers.Should have saved my money; this story was too far-fetched. Didn't finish it."
4,Good book,"I like this book more than a lot of Ann Rice's books. It is not so full of sadism, and homosexuality. It is an interesting story, and holds the attention."
3,The movie was better,"I bought this book after seeing the movie, and boy was I disappointed! This was the 4th book by Anne Rice that I read, and have since gone on to read 2 more. After 6 books I have finally given up on Anne and her ability to write an ending."
2,Not Sleeping Beauty,"I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her ""Sleeping Beauty"" series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."
3,Not Bad...Just Different,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.
2,Let down...,"It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels."
1,Pathetically bad!,"This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
2,Stick with Sleeping Beauty,"Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)"
3,"Entertaining, but not what you'd think...","When I bought Exit to Eden, I was expecting a rather graphic, intense novel more along the lines of the Beauty trilogy. What I got was a whirlwind romance bracketed by The Club. The Club is much akin to the Beauty trilogy; however, The Club is played up, then drops almost completely out of sight. If you enjoy romance novels, minus the kinkiness that Anne Rice has a reputation for, then this might be right up your alley. It's got just a dash of kink, but predominantly it's a tale of two lovers. As in the Beauty books, it gets a bit repetetive after a while. Unlike her Vampire Chronicles, where the end seemed to come all to soon, by the time I made it to the end of Exit to Eden, I was good and ready to get there."
3,"Starts off into the wilderness, but returns to small town.","This is my least-favorite of Rice's works. It begins boldly, with an over-the-top sexual adventure in the fringes of s&m, but ends up with an unlikely and boringly banal marriage.It is as if Rice had an attack of conscience (or publisher?) half way through. So the book ends up being neither a satisfying piece of erotica or romance. Neither fish nor fowl...I preferred her Beauty books for her somewhat unique brand of b&d erotica, and on the literary side, her best are not the Vampire Chronicles, not the Mayfair witch books, but the little-known Cry to Heaven, and Feast of All Saints.This is neither good nor typical Rice."
5,WOW!,"I can't believe I read this book in one sitting. This is the first novel by Anne Rice I've ever read. Her words are so descriptive, I found myself just painting the images in my mind. Even my body shivered as I read some of the encounters between Elliott and Lisa. It's a good story. I don't really get the S&M stuff, but still a good book. Most memorable section...the butter and cinnamon in New Orleans."
5,The hell with princesses; I'm saving the world!,"I think this is enough to tell you that the game is great. This game resembles Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but has the better graphics and more mature gameplay that you would expect from XBOX. The graphics are amazing, and the controls are easy to use. The characters in this game are amazing, each with their own unique traits. There are several levels in which the game takes you to places far and wide. From a Snowy Winter Wonderlad to a Firery Desert, you get the feeling of visiting places all around the world just by a move of the joystick. With a resemblance to the old and happy Mario64 and Banjo-Kazooie, this is a must buy game."
5,Nice quality necklace,"I get a lot of compliments on this necklace when I wear it. The chain is heavy enough to be sturdy, but not too bulky. The amethysts are very deep in color and have good clarity. Recommended."
2,Not a fan of these,"I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually."
2,Didn't like them,"The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor, with a strange aftertaste. They are filling though, but then again so is eating compressed cardboard!"
4,Reese Towpower,Well built... i recommend having 2 people to install...i bought it for a 1996 Chevy Silverado... the frame was cut different than what the towing hitch was so i had to modify it...so it took about 5 hours to install alone...
2,Vile from the beginning,"Let me start by saying that I never put down a book, even if I don't like it. This is one that I couldn't even get past the first few pages. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book. I'm glad it was a free download on Kindle. I gave it two stars only because I didn't give it a chance to get better. If I hadn't deleted it, maybe I would give it another chance, but I certainly won't pay for it."
4,spirited,"My brother lives in Bangkok and I've been there many times so I was keen to see what a novel set there would be like and I wasn't disappointed - Mr Moore evokes the seediness and poverty without it appearing soul-destroyingly hopeless because he manages to balance it with interesting characters (both the good, the bad and the humanly flawed), a good mystery and moments of beauty and humour. I enjoyed it and intend to try the next one..."
2,Gets better over time,"I almost gave up reading this book after a couple of chapters for the same reasons as the 1-star reviewers. I can't say I care for the writing style. It reminds me of the ""Guy Noir"" skit on ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which is, of course, supposed to be a funny take-off on these kinds of books. The protagonist seemed to be more of a stereotypical formula rather than a real person. I struggled up through Chapter 9. Then I began to get more invested in the story. I think the writing began to improve a bit and the characters gained some dimension. Still, it ends up being 2 stars for me. Perhaps his later books are better?"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read....,"I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book."
2,sorry....,"Sorry, I couldn't get into this one at all. If you want to read some GOOD thrillers located in Bangkok, try John Burdett's books beginning with Bangkok 8."
1,What the heck is up with this cover?,"'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
1,The worst book ever written.,"Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."
3,Bizarre,"Read this for the novelty, not because it is well-written or a good story. In fact, it is over-written and very strange. As a period piece or a primary source, this works well. Stay away if you're looking for something to enjoy."
3,Was this a story or an essy?,"This book was not so much a story as it was an essay about ideals. The actual storyline had little to do with what the book was trying to accomplish which was all too obvious. Truthfully, I found that many of the points were very valid but the way that they were expressed made me dislike the book. This story of men trapped in a female only society makes it seem as though women are better than men (which could be the authors opinion?) However there are many ideals which can be learned from by reading this book. I recommend this book not to those who are looking for a story but for those who wish to her ideas about our socitey."
3,"Interesting concept, thought-provoking to say the least","This book was interesting, to say the least. While I didn't particularly connect with the characters, I don't think that Gilman's point was to have readers fall in love with the characters - the message here is deeper than the characters or the story. It definitely gave me a lot to think about, the main thing being that this society, because they have no men, don't see through a lens of gender in any way. As I can't imagine such a thing - women are always compared to men in real life - it is an interesting concept to spend time thinking about. What would it be like if people were just people and gender was completely irrelevant?If you want to know whether or not I would recommend reading Herland, the answer is yes I would if you are interested in classic feminist literature. It is definitely a valuable read but I do need to acknowledge that the book may not be for everyone. If you are interested in this stuff, then, definitely pick it up!"
2,Not Deserving of its Clout,"I know that ""Herland"" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend ""Herland"" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at ""social housekeeping"" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."
5,Fabulous book!,I read this book many years ago and wanted to read it again.My order was handled quickly and professionally.Great service. Great book.
2,This book is hard to understand,"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."
2,"Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding","If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet."
2,takes a wrong turn,"fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared."
2,Skip 451,"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."
4,This book was very well wrote,"I think that Fahrenheit 451 was a great book. The story was based on a very good topic. One thing I liked about the book was that it was very well written. This book never got to boring or to lame, it was always fun to just keep on reading. People like me who don't like to read just want to skim through it and pay no attention, but in this book I was so intrested I never wanted to put it down and stop. One thing i didn't like about this book was that some parts were very hard to understand. It took me a while on some pages to fully understand what I was reading. I think teachers should recomend this book to their students."
3,Overrated,"It's not a bad book. But Fahrenheit 451 is hardly representative of the best that the Sci-fi genre has to offer, and it's a shame that it's endless place on students ""summer reading lists"" hasn't been challenged. For some reason fahrenheit 451, the Martian Chronicles and 1984 seem to have been decided on as the representatives of science fiction according to your average english teacher... and that's doing the students a disservice. So, read and enjoy this book, but if you find it a bit dry and it's your first forray into SF, by all means keep exploring. There are SO many better books out there..."
3,Bought for college class,"Bought this for my sons college English class, I read this book years ago. And I saw the movie, the book follows the movie somewhat, but then again most movies do."
2,Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz,"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again."
5,The near future is here!,"Come on - a classic. Montag is iconic and impervious to criticism; c'mon, he hates burning books and he's a 'fireman.' Bradbury has created one his best stories in this tale of the near future, which tragically, is beginning to mirror our own. How many young people to I hear say 'I don't like to read, not my thing.' Are we so far away from Fahrenheit 451? Five stars."
1,fahrenheit 451,the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
1,I HATE THIS BOOK,I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
1,In My Opinion....,"Fahrenheit 451 lists in my top 5 of worst books ever. my english class had to read it. i didnt even read the lastsection. by the time the first test rolled around, i hadnt even read 10 pages. i evenually forced myself to read it but stopped when i got to last section cause i thought if i read anymore, i might die. i felt no connection to the characters, no emotion towards them. Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid. For u, many ur will like it. Maybe not. Cant no until u attempt to read it(NOTE: i said attempt)"
1,The usual dreck,"I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
1,this book was awful,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
1,Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?,"If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published"
1,This book was really odd..........,This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
4,Fahrenheit 451 was a good book but hard to follow,I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge. I had a very hard time putting the book down. Fahrenheit 451 was a lot like our socity today. Instead of putting out fires firemen started them. That strange twist was what I liked most about the book. I deducted a half star because it was a little hard to follow.
4,Fahrenheit451 is a great book and I would reccomend it,I gave fahrenheit 451 4 stars because it was an interesting and thoughtful book. It shows that books have been an advent to all major ideas.Without books creativity and thought would be stifled. Ray Bradbury`s classis story is a sure bet for good reading.I deducted 1 star because the book was sometimes hard to follow but don`t let that deter you from reading it.
3,A startling realization of how the world may turn out.,"This book ended abruptly, and in a way I didn't expect. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't appreciate science fiction books, or to someone who doesn't pick up weird storylines very well. Otherwise, it's a good book."
3,"Very interesting, good plot, but a bit gloomily written","The story-line and plot of the book were excellent, and Bradbury did an excellent job at setting the scence, however, hsi writing left me somewhat confused and uninterested at times. The ending wasn't too great either...I really liked 1984 much better."
3,Disappointing,"Story of Guy Montag, a ""fireman"" in a repressive society, who repents his job of burning books and joins an underground society committed to memorizing the great works of literature. Bradbury's excessively florid, overwrought prose bothered me greatly. The futuristic society of book-burners never really seemed fully realized or plausible. Dealt with some questions of book burning and censorship intelligently, but still seemed a bit nave. Bradbury struggles with long-form fiction. Never felt the execution rose to the level of thematic ambition."
5,Hauntingly realistic!,"I'm a sophomore in high school, and I just finished reading F451. I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be ""digested"" more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships. Western Civilization had better watch out, or Ray Bradbury's sci-fi book will become REALITY..."
4,Fahrenheit 451... Good or Bad?,"Hello People,I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. I wouldn't say that it was the best book in the world but it was definetly a good book and you should read it. It isn't your average book that you're used to, it's a little diffrent. Bradbury writes really well and you can follow the story, but sometimes he would just say something and you would have no clue what he's talking about. So then you have to go back and read a couple pages just to figure out whats going on. But above all I would say that it is a good book and even though it's a little diffrent, it's good to give diffrent things a try. :)Peace-out and enjoy the book!!!!!!!!!"
2,NOT THAT GOOD,Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
3,Classic that benefits from discussion,"This is a true classic that most people are required to read in school. I never had to, and I regret that. Having read it now, I can see what the benefit of reading it school would have been. Books read in school are discussed and examined in detail. This book would lend itself well to that type of in depth analysis.I am glad that I at least read this book, although I found it only okay. I think in a school setting I would have enjoyed it much more. I just didn't find it as captivating or emotional as other books I've read.I have the 50th anniversary edition, which contains an interview with Ray Bradbury about the 50th anniversary, and how he feels about the success of the book. It was quite insightful and interesting to read."
4,A Mindless Zombie,"Irony without imagination and the will to think for yourself.You're just a mindless zombie, a puppet for people to control you. Inmy opinion, that's what Ray Bradbury is saying in his book. - J. Litton, BDHS"
4,Great Book,"Ray Bradbury takes us into the future where the government burns books to keep people from thinking and/or rebelling. I think that these circumstances could be somewhat true to the future of this world. Dictators have burned books throughout history to keep the people tame in their ideas. We should all just step back and say,""Hey, do we really want to give the government this much power. I mean, what happened to power to the people"
4,Eerie foreshadowing of where technology might be taking us,"I bought this book after Ray Bradbury died because the obituaries said that this was his best work. I did not know what to expect.The book is about a future in which [almost] everyone live vicariously through the lives of others delivered via technology. The system prohibits independent thinking or feeling and actually used the fire department to burn up anyone that is a 'problem'.As I see more people (myself included) using their cell phones, social media, and on-line entertainment, I see our society moving in this direction. It is amazing to me that Bradbury created this dystopian vision many years in advance of the current technology that almost makes it possible today."
4,Amazingly Relevant!,"Amazingly relevant for our times. Story is a little odd and wordy, but it is an excellently crafted piece that will go down in history as a classic."
3,Ordinary,I thought this book was ok. The book is about a firefighter who has to make a decision that could possibly change his life. The firemen have to burn all the books because it is illegal to read. It's interesting that in the future books would actually be banned from reading.
4,Is this where we're headed?,Another book I read as a young man and dismissed. The book is so spot on. The difference is people tend to be obsessed with PDAs not walls in their homes.
3,Fahrenheit 451,"I was not assigned to read it in school, so I wanted to know why it was such big choice of school districts. I'm glad I read it. Where I wasn't impressed with Bradbury's simplistic style, the content gave me a lot to think about."
5,Ironic & Captivating,"This book was short, and deep. It was amazingly deep in fact, for the length. Bradbury captures something about our nature both to believe in something passionately, and to ignorantly become sheepish. There is lying, betrayal, and small glimmers of home, in a macabre future. One of my favorites by far."
4,really good,"this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
4,Amazing,"I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the book interesting for me. Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using ""firemen"" to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."
3,This book is too confusing and kind of boring,"At first the book is very confusing and lame, but it gets better towards the middle. The idea is a little stretched out. I think the book should have ended without the last couple of chapters because I got sick of reading it. The author seems a little messed up."
4,I generally liked this book.,"This book is exceptional in its portrayal of the future. Yet, it is slow for the few chapters. If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!"
5,Best Book,"This book just sweeps into the world of so called happiness.I think the book is warning us about the dangers of technology.I love the way he portrays life in the future and how liberal and lazy the people have become.I especially love Captain Beatty's personality, he can burn books but yet he knows quite alot about them.Captain Beatty's name is kind of ironic in how it incorporates the word beatific, which means to show extreme joy or bliss,when in the book they all are trying to stay happy when really they're not.They are not happy in my opinion because they always have to be doing something they can't just think or have a conversation with a human being.This book is very interesting and I recomend it to teens so they can learn more about life itself."
4,Fiction?,"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."
5,I really enjoyed this one!,"For grade levels 11th and up, Fahrenheit 451 is sure to please readers of all intrests. Fireman Guy Montag is deeply troubled when he meets a local girl and watchs a women burn in her home. He then realizes the importance of those books he keeps burning and within a few days, he is a totally diffrent person.Author Ray Bradbury predicts the future and successfuly holds the reader's intrest. Frightingly, Ray predictions are quite acurate. Read it and see for yourself."
4,something special,"A nice easy read for someone who may be interested in a futuristic fun read. Guy Montag brings to the reader a whole new life style that no one has ever experienced. I enjoyed reading this book because there was never a moment when I felt bored with what I was reading or thought of putting it down. I recommend this book to the young adult who is looking for an a relaxing, fun read."
4,Love this book- so much to think about,A great read and very thought provoking. We read as part of a community grant - The Big Read. Would strongly recommend.
3,We're Almost There,"Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" is a pretty depressing book to read. Oh, not really because of what happens in the book (which is not a bowl of cherries), but because of how close we are to the society he describes. We've pretty much reached the big media/pervasive television/don't read point that he describes as the precursor to his universe. The only thing left is the actual banning of books. Though horrible for us, Bradbury writes a pretty good story around it. The problem I have with the book is that Bradbury jumps the ""tell-a-story"" rails quite a bit and ends up on the ""classic citations"" and philosophy tracks too often and for too long. It just gets in the way of what he's saying. Of course, my saying that is one of the slippery slopes he describes (condense books down by removing the thought-producing parts) as leading to his world. But, even so, because of these ""interruptions"" to the story, I rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."
4,Fahrenheit 451,"In Ray Bradbury's science-fiction story Fahrenheit 451, he tells of a world set in the future when it's illegal to own books. The main character, Guy Montag, works for the fire department setting fires in homes occupied by literature. Guy Montag, unhappy at home, is surrounded by technology that he feels is unimportant. Guy Montag soon realizes that burning the books would ruin years of writing and history, when he takes home a handful of books he is put in danger. The setting is believable, unknown, and familiar all at the same time. It has a lot of similar issues as today's world does, but with a futuristic spin on them. Fahrenheit 451 is a fast paced, fascinating read; I would recommend it to anybody who likes sci-fi thrillers."
4,Warning Against Evils of Censorship,"Although not as profound as George Orwell's ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" still stands as a prophetic warning against the evils of censorship, and controlling the masses through ignorance.The little lost in profundity by comparison to ""1984"" is more than made up in readability. Whereas ""1984"" took me two days to complete, I read through ""Fahrenheit 451"" in an afternoon. Additionally ""1984"" ends with an feeling of hopelessness, whereas 451 ends with some degree of optimism for the future.Overall, 451 still stands out as one of a limited number of dystopian stories whose message remains as vital today as when it was published."
3,English Grade*Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 is a very intresting and mind boggling book. It made me realize how important books are in society, and just how much books really do influence your reality. In F451 the government was afraid to let the people have their own ideas. They wanted the community to think what they wanted them to think. The people were so caught up on their material items, that they even forgot about thinking of humans as real human beings. Most people in this particular community did not ""talk"" with one another, they would rather sit in front of the T.Vs. After a while the community wasn't even people anymore, they were robots. They did what the government wanted them to do, when it wanted them to do it. They lost all sense of individuality and idealism. This novel made me value books, and made me realize what an imperfect world would be like...<P(...)"
1,The Worst Book Ever!,"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"
1,Didn't Like it!!,"Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time."
2,"I know it's a classic, but I was not impressed.","Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did."
1,CD Fahrenheit 451,"I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious."
3,Didn't read,Purchased for my son for a school project. He only read it because he had to for a grade *
5,Farenheit 451: The relevant and haunting masterpiece,"Guy Montag is a hero of heroes in this masterpiece of a book. He is a misguided soul who never wonders whether his and his companions' actions are just and right. When the idea of the flaw of his society is introduced, Guy goes on a difficult journey for the truth. This is a book that will stay with you forever."
5,Breathtaking,"This book was the most breathtaking, jawdropping, and eyeopening phenomenon. I have read this book several times and every time I see something that I didn't see before and gain one more level in the battle against ignorance."
4,This Powerful Warning for Our Future Is Powerful!,Bradbury creates a perfect dystopia in which life as we know it does not exist. The deep value of somewhat simple style makes this book one of the finest ever written. This book should be a necessity for anyone who plans on helping to preserve liberty for one's self and for all.
4,"A decent book, I see somwhat related to 1984",It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today.
4,"The more times I read F451, the better it gets","I am a 16-year-old and I also had to read this (in my holidays) for school. The book was very confusing at first, but it makes you think. This is the only sci-fiction novel I have liked. Those who hate this novel show themselves to be almost illiterate (just look for the spelling mistakes)."
4,Just reinstating what another has already said.,"I totally agree with ""Reader from Vermont"" Whoever you are, you summed up exactly how I felt about the book. I chose to read it because of all the hype. I was disappointed, I expected more. I feel that it is a good book, but overrated."
5,Great book,All theses years later this book still holds up. Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone. Somebody should do a modern movie remake of this story.
5,Fahrenheit 451,"I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D"
3,Fahrenheit 451,"In L.A. our class read this book. At first I did not like this book because it was not exciting. When I got to the second chapter the story was getting more interesting because Guy Montag started to go against the government rules about reading books. Guy's captain, Beatty, starts catching on to Guy about bringing books to his house. Towards the end I really started to enjoy it because Guy burns Beatty and runs away. Guy meets these other firemen who also started to read books and ran away. It was a good book. I thought it was cool the way the author wrote those similes and how he related everything to each other. This author did a pretty good job with this book."
4,"Great book, especially the 50th Anniversary Edition","The story is simple, but powerful. As other reviewers have noted, some of the details that Bradbury imagined in 1950 (when he wrote it, not the publication date of 1953) have come true (large TVs on the walls, a move towards simplistic sensationalism, the deep distrust of education and educated people, etc.) I found the writing to be serviceable, sometimes brilliant. Occasionally the metaphors get too long winded and overly descriptive.The 50th Anniversary Edition, published by Ballantine Books/Del Rey is wonderful. Not only do we get the full unedited text (ironically, this book about censorship has been censored frequently over the years), but we also get the afterword and coda (added in the late 70s, early 80s) and an illuminating 10 page interview with Bradbury himself. In the interview he describes his writing process, how he thinks the book holds up today, and whether or not he'd write a sequel. It's a great addition to the book."
4,FAHRENHEIT 451: A Book That Will Burn Your Mind,"Fahrenheit 451. The temperature at which books catch fire and burn.Odd title, but not as odd as the story itself. The community in which this story takes place seems strange, but it's shockingly similar to our own. Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do? Find out by reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451."
1,Not worth reading,"This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
3,Your typical required reading material...,"Basically, Montag, a firefighter from the ""future"", burns down houses that have books inside. In the ""future"", books are banned, and Bradbury tries to describe a world of the ""future"" with big screen, color TVs. Too bad, Bradbury, that this world is already here.It was mostly a boring read, except for a few moments. You could describe this book as depressing. Everyone, even Montag, seems to be unhappy, and I really don't care what Bradbury has to think about how depressing our world is becoming."
1,Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom.,"After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away."
1,It Deserves Negative Stars!,"Last year we had to read this as a class. There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."
4,Very good book worth reading,This book although one of the worst distopian books was good in that it was for a childs view. Some of the characters showed extreme likeness to modern society and the theme was very well developed. many very good literature components in this work.
2,fahrenheit 451,"I order the book a week before it shipped and then took so long to get here I had to download the book to my daughters Kindle the night before she needed it for school. That cost me $9.99, and then got the book on the 4th or 5th of February. Won't use this one again."
3,Ironic book on Firefighters,"The was a fun little futuristic book on society and the fear that someone may learn something different then the government's message by reading. It tells a story of two lonely people who are caught up in their own lifes but learn about a whole new world by reading.The premise of the story of Firefighter who burn down building of people who don't follow the government is ironic. The story in interesting and tender in parts.The only problem with this book is the usual ending that all these types of books have with the two characters escaping and the rest of the world, well you know if you have read it."
3,Can I burn this book?,"I know it's criminal not to like a classic book....but different strokes right? The concept is a communistic approach, and is an amazing concept. I just found it tough to read, slow, tough to get into, and not ground breaking, or profound at all. I was pretty disappointed in this book, found it a litte boring, and while it's very pointed it just wasn't for me. I prefer Animal Farm to this book."
2,smart idea but...,"Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and ""appetizing"":a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."
2,"Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!","I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking."
2,Too obvious for even young readers,"I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting."
3,"Interesting Idea, Poor Execution","The author starts out with a very interesting approach to the problem of censorship, but eventually falls flat. What would have made for a nice magazine sized story, doesn't have the ability to fill out a novel. The book is is mercifully short, but the story is at times dull and pointless and full of dull and pointless characters. The only character of interest is killed off after a couple pages. Its not an entirely fair comparison, but 1984 and Brave New World were orders of magnitude better than 451. The ending is completely unsatisfying and the author's vision of the future, both hopes and fears, do not ring true. Overall its an interesting read just for the concept involved, but keep your expectations low."
2,"Great Book to read, but NOT to LISTEN to.","I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's."
3,Bradbury,"This is not Bradbury's best work. His forte is the science fiction short story. His novel is ponderous and slow moving--and will turn off more young people from sci-fi than it will attract. One wonders why so many high schools use it as a required reading in sci-fi when there is so much out there which is truly exciting and attractive to young people while being equal to or better than this particular piece in a literary sense. David Weber, Jack Campbell, Robert Jordan and a host of others come quickly to mind. Even Asimov, dated though he is, would be preferable as an introduction for young adults to sci-fi reading which offers rich literary content."
3,Classics are never as great to revisit,"It's a disturbingly prophetic reading and radical idea for its day and age. But the concept is old hat in this day where it's a regular affair. It's simply no longer the system shock it once was. I personally find the characterization a bit thin, but that was arguably the point in this sterile society. It's a classic for a good reason, but I don't know if I find the read entertaining these days."
5,Great Sale!,I bought this book for my personal library and was thrilled by it's condition. It was in mint condition and the seller was great to work with. The book was delivered really quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Thanks!
1,Hardly even deserves 1 star,"This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?"
1,Horrible execution of an addressable topic...,"This book is quite possibly the worst piece of science fiction I have read... It is dramatically boring and far too contrived to be interesting... The world Bradbury creates is thoroughly dry and I simply hated his look at the future... Nothing was at all interesting or thought-provoking, except for the books examination into the issues of censorship as a whole. I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly...."
1,How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME?,"To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves. If Bradbury wanted us to realize the importance of books, the LEAST he could do was make this book SEMI-interesting! Essentially: Don't waste your time."
1,Not worth it,"I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me."
2,Overrated!,"I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't. I know that there are some good points to it, but not enought to sit and read it over and over again.PS-If you don't agree with me, please don't click the ""No"" button below."
1,HATED IT!,"I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently."
1,Confusing,who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
4,Still Relevent,"Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas."
5,A Great Read...Thank you!,"Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance."
5,One of the Best Books EVER!,"This is such an amazing novel, everybody should read it because of its message. While some books become outdated, this novel is still relevant today."
4,"Intense, searing and frightening, if a little confusing.","While sometimes hard to follow, Ray Bradbury's science fiction classic is still intense and searing when at its best and bears many frightening resemblences to our own world. This futuristic civilization regards cursory items such as magazines as better than books; the television has pretty much taken over; there's even a mention of kids frequently killing each other. Pretty amazing stuff, considering Bradbury wrote this way back in 1953. At least we haven't gone so far as to burn all books, but who knows; maybe things will get so bad that we just might....CALLING ALL GUY MONTAGS!"
5,Chilling,"To you reviewers who had to read this book for school and hated it: I too was forced to read it when I was in 8th grade, and felt the same way about it that you do. I thought it was the dumbest most boring book I'd ever read.I'm telling you now: wait 5 or 6 years, and pick this book up again. I promise you will enjoy it. It's a story of an oppressed society and a man with the courage to try and break free. Please, give Farenheit 451 another chance. You won't regret it."
3,Proving in its own way the truth of the book...,"I just purchased the Kindle version of this classic today. I paid $9.99. On the ""fourth"" page, there is an error at the end of Clarisse's statement, ""But, you're just a man, after all..."" The truncated end of the next paragraph is attached, so that it reads, ""But, you're just a man, after allon again too soon...""I certainly hope the rest of the text isn't riddled with such sloppy proofing. This wasn't a free e-book, or even a deeply discounted ebook. It's a classic priced at $9.99. I expect better than this, Amazon.I bought the book today, June 6,2012, because of this morning's news of Ray Bradbury's passing. I thought, how clever, to own a book on the demise of books on my Kindle. Ironic, that the Kindle version starts off with such a sloppy mistake. Ironic, and sorely disappointing."
4,Burn Baby Burn,"I have enjoyed reading this book. everyone will enjoy it after the first reading. It may be slighlty difficult in the beginning but if you continue to read you will find this book to be very deep, and compelling. I feel as if the more you read it, the more you will enjoy it because you will absorb more information that you may have missed on the first reading. Go Montag!"
3,Frightening Realism,"This book was neither good, nor was it bad. I admit, it was a difficult read...it was very slow paced...but the story had a frightening realism to it. It depicts a society where books are burned and knowledge is, in essence, controlled by a government out of control. The premise was very interesting, but the paistagging detail in which everything was described left me fairly bored with it. It has a nice moral...if you can stick out the bordom."
3,It is worth reading it,"This books is interesting. It's about a man named Montag who is a fireman but instead of putting out the fire, he starts them by burning the books he finds in other people's houses. In my own opinion I think this book is about reality, because even though we are no burning books a lot of people are losing interest in reading them. Peolpe would rather watch T.V.,play Nintendo,get on the computer and do everything from there than going through a book. So you will probably like to read this book.You will understand the importance of books and you will appreciate them more."
3,Eh... I expected more.,"I thought the book was pretty overrated. Admittedly, the concept was interesting and the story rolls around all right, but the superfluous metaphor-laden rambling passages really irked me. I can only sit through so much.I think I would have liked this book more if I didn't keep picturing Bradbury sitting somewhere with a painfully smug look on his face. But all in all, Fahrenheit 451 is worth reading, though not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."
3,Fahrenhiet 451,"Fahrenheit 451, a science fiction book written by Ray Bradbury, is a good read. In the book, Guy Montag, a fireman, is paid to burn books. In fact, all fireman are paid to burn books. This book, being a science fiction, takes place in the future. Guy enjoys his job. He gets paid well and understands the system, books are for burning. He is under the impression that books are full of nothing but garbage. He meets a girl named Clarisse who changes his views completely. He starts to become more interested in books. He hides books in his house. He suddenly realizes what he has been doing. This book is a somewhat difficult read. It may not be enjoyed by children under sixth grade. The sentences are somewhat long and complex. At times, the vocabulary is also difficult. I would rate this book fair. I would only recommend it to people who are heavily interested in science fiction."
4,Twilight zone material,"I always like to read a classic every once in a while, whether it be a mystery, literature, or good old science fiction. It seems that many of the classic science fiction novels deal more with man's attitude toward his surroundings rather than the stories of aliens and the future world gone crazy thru technology. This book takes the simple premise of a world where books are illegal and turns it into a Twilight Zone episode. The best part of a novel such as this is that the reader is forced to contemplate a scenario which is actually imaginable and decide how he or she would act and react. An interesting story to say the least....."
4,This Book Is A Scorcher,"This book follows the same outline of the great novel ""1984"" by George Orwell. This book deals mainly with the threat that censorship poses on a nation. Guy Montag, a fireman, has never had a problem going along with the norm until he meets a young girl who changes his perspective on life. He then begins to question why he burns books which leads him into trouble with his boss Fire Chief Beatty. There are many important lessons that one can draw from this book but mainly the idea that books never die and that they live on in people's hearts and minds as long as there lessons are remembered. This book can teach young people to appreciate the importance of books, a must read."
3,Very Interesting,Fahrenheit 451 was very realistic and makes you wonder if the world will turn out like that. Ray Bradbury is also a great author. His description is very good. Fahrenheit 451 is almost a little to advanced. It is hard to imagine the world ever getting that way. I personally prefer books that could actually happen and this seems very unreal.But does keep you wondering what will happen. Many youth seemed to like this book and I think it was very interesting.
3,Poor Man's Brave New World,"This ""classic"" left me with the feeling as though it had been written by a very talented 10th-grader. The basic premise was interesting (if somewhat borrowed from Huxley's Brave New World)but by virtue of sophomoric storytelling, overly unrealistic and flowery dialogue and huge leaps in logic the writer wasn't very effective in suspending my disbelief."
5,A Great Summer Read,"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."
3,Not what I expected,"I love books like this more than I can express. Utopian society type books are probably my favorite things to read. So, naturally, I picked up Fahrenheit 451. I had heard great things about it from everyone except a good friend of mine who said simply that although he didn't by any means despise it, he thought it was a tad corny. I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the style of writing. But, as I read on, I found that the book just felt a little... off. I think that it may have been a little unbelievable really, especially the Mechanical Hounds and such. I was also disappointed about Clarisse, although I won't go into detail about that. The thing that I really liked though, was that Bradbury hit the nail on the head when it comes to the development of political correctness. Overall, the book was alright. It was a quick read and I am still certainly glad that I read it."
3,Ultimate Fahrenheit 451 Review (nothing remains to be said),"Well, it's not a bad book. Actually it should not be considered a book though, it is, rather, a short story. The ideas expressed are all very valable but there isn't much of a story and the science behind it laughable. Bradbury makes good points and argues well, it's just that if you're reading this book (or any book for that matter) it probably implies that you already like reading and value books pretty high. So Bradbury is preaching to the converted. This book makes a great reading list though, many names are dropped and books are quoted from. Instead of reading this book you should read any of the books mentioned in it. Or just as a reminder of why you love to read so much."
5,My Favorite Book,"I love the writings of Ray Bradbury and this book tops them all.Although decades old, it's message is loud and clear. And I still think that the allegories and themes in this are still prevelant in today's society."
3,Overrated,"An average book, canonized as a classic because of its ""important"" message. It's a favorite for middle and high school English classes because its theme dovetails nicely with the lesson teachers all over the country try to teach their students: ""Reading is good for you!"" Also, it expertly exploits those teachers' worst fear: that reading will become an irrelevant activity and that TV will permanently take its place. As far as quality is concerned, unfortunately, Bradbury's novel simply isn't good enough to merit its overblown reputation. Don't believe the hype."
5,Thinking is for LOSERS!,"This book was really good and made me think a lot more about society and censorship. We are already at the point where everything we think about has already been thought for us(news, magazines,media,etc.). I guess as long as one is happy with society we will always be ruled and brainwashed by the government. Anyways...read this book it'll make you think about real life and how lucky we are that society isn't as screwed up as it could be."
4,Enough has already been said about this classic novel.,Many people have already read and reviewed this novel. I willjust say that it is worth the 7 rating.
2,Ultra-overrated,"I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."
2,Simplistic Viewpoints,"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept."
3,for my granddaughter for school,I bought this for her as she needed it for her english prep class. I hope that she enjoyed it.
3,Fahrenheit 451,"This book is a classic and predicts many products that we use today such as flat screen tv on the wall, blue tooth, and drones."
3,A world you wouldn't want to know.,"Fahrenheit 451 is a cautionary tale set in a world where books are banned. Named after the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, the book tells the story of one extraordinary week in the life of Guy Montag, a ""fireman"" whose job it is to burn the houses of those harbouring books. Until one day he begins to think that his job is not as worthwhile as his society would make him think. This single act of questioning leads to a chain of events. By the book's end, the world that Montag once knew will never be the same again.Part fable, part thriller, Fahrenheit 451 is a fascinating and provocative read."
4,Excellent Read,"My daughter has to read this for her 10th grade english class and I decided to check it out myself. It is not as well written or as compelling as 1984 but it is still a very good read. The author makes a number of excellent points. To me it felt like film noir mixed up with some comic book qualities in my imagination. Still, a very good read with lessons to share."
4,A classic read,This is one of those books that you see pieces of in all kinds of other books and movies.
4,F. 451,"I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well."
3,Fahrenheit 451-By Ray Bradbury,"This book is about a community that has banned and outlawed the viewing and reading of books. The community had firemen burn books. Guy Montag is one of the firemen described in this book. Problems develop between him and his wife, Mildred. Bradbury describes their life as being boring and dull. Guy Montag and his family are only allowed to watch television. Montag's neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse, is excited by the ideas of reading books. He then decides to hide a stash of books in his home.I found this book to be really strange. It is ironic to see how Bradbury was basically able to predict how the world and society is now. It was interesting to see how this book developed."
5,Mike's Review,"Farenheight 451 is an extrordinary piece of literature. It contains a number of symbols. Ray Bradbury has written a deep complex piece of literaature in Farenheight 451. It is set to take place in the future. Everything isin a fast pace, and there is not a second to breathe in the world that it takes place. You can not walk along the road. Also you can not talk. The most odd things in this book are firemen start fires, and it is illegal to own books. After reading this book I am left to wonder... will the future really be like this?"
4,My Opinion about Fahrenheit 451,"I liked the symbolism Ray Bradbury used in this book. I really liked Mildred and the ""mechanical dog"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm glad I read it in class so my teacher could explain the symbolism and metaphors to me. Other than that i really liked this book.Shoutz to 8-4 at Holy Angels!"
3,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 was a very strange and different book. I got the meaning out of it, but it was hard to understand. The book is about the world in the future. The people of the future believe education is a waste of time. They burn books and are addicted to T.V. One man, Guy Montag, starts to see things differently. He doesn't like how his life is and the people who are in it. He breaks free from the world he knows and goes on a rough adventure to escape what he's always known. I would say this book is meant for people who range from teen to adult and who enjoy reading sci-fi novels."
5,A Perfect Quick Read,"A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only ""what"" things are about but ""why"", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."
5,Thesis Statement For Fahrenheit 451,"Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."
5,Incredible literature (I am only 11),"I thought that this book was great and it really makes you wonder. This book was written by a person who had a great imagination, the best. And like Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important that knowledge."" Which I thought was the moral of the book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read where one page makes you read the next."
3,hard to understand,"This book was to discriptive in some of the sceens and others had barly anything. The author never said anywhere what the time/date it was. It was really hard to understand. Sometimes I know what was going on, it din't stay in one place very long to catch up."
3,A review of the AUDIO BOOK,"This is just a short review of the audio book of this great classic read by the author. The rendition is just terrible. It may be interesting to listen to the author's voice, but he is clearly no professional reader (and of course he should not expected to be!!), his voice is hoarse, and the rendition overall very very unpleasant to listen to, to the point that I ended up stopping listening to the CDs after a short while. I love audio books, but this one cannot be recommended at all, unless you have a special interest in getting acquainted with Bradbury's voice. If you want to listen to a good author who's also an accomplished reader of his own stories, try Neil Gaiman!"
1,A good idea gone horribly wrong!,"At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
1,How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled,"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses."
4,"Farhenheit 451, Jessica H's Review","I believe that the book Fahrenheit 451 was very well written and very interesting. Mr. Bradbury made the book have a lot of good vocabulary for a 12 year old to learn. This book is one of the better books that I have had to read in school. Prior to reading this book I never really liked science fiction books. This book has changed that dramatically. It also taught me fun facts like (before reading this i didn't know) paper burns at 451 degrees. WOW if a book can just do that, i don't even know why people would ban them in the future. LOL :)"
2,"This is not a good or bad book, but its O.K","I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read. I will not recommend this book to my friends because it's boring. ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about Guy Montag, a fireman, who starts fire but does not putout fires. In this society, the fireman has to set up fires and burn the books. Usually when we hear ""fireman"", we always think about that their job is to put out fires. It is totally different than we thought, right? This book is about censorship, that is, people does not have the right to read. In that society, the firemen have the rights to burn. Not only books, but also the houses and people. In this book, an innocent woman who has being burn in her house with her books. How can the fireman has the right to burn a human life, a human life! Especially a book lover, How?"
2,Disappointing. Does not deserve to be a 'classic',Length:: 3:49 MinsFahrenheit 451Fahrenheit 451: A Novel
3,The Review,I by reading this book I learned many interresting thing on the future. the future is fulled with many possiblitys and learning. hi
2,This book stunk!,"Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living."
2,Turn the stove up to 451 degrees and throw this book in!,"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my ""burn this book"" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named ""GUY MONTAG"". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all ""offensive"" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the ""family"" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"
2,"Great book, bad performance","As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process."
5,None,"I am reading this book in 7th grade advanced language arts. Most students don't like it and think that it's confusing, but i love it."
4,"Fine novel, but it's too short","Fahrenheit 451, is a fine novel. It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" or ""Brave New World"". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it's too short. It's kind of like a novella. While reading I was thinking whether there is an allusion to the tremendous fear or reds and the communists during the 50's in the U.S.?"
1,huge disappointment,"at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
1,Too bad Amazon can't help out students,"I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you."
4,More than just sensorship...,"The lessons learned from good authors are timeless. Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new ""Amber Alerts"" adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and ""editing"" are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.""I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book."""
3,451,"Fahrenheit 451, I am not a huge fan of science ficion, but I decided to read this book for class. It was really distubring book about future socitey. Something really disturbs me about this book;it is that fire fighters are starting the fires but their true job is to put fires out. What I like about this book is that Clarisse helps Montag to understand about books, so that's why montag starts hiding books in his house. My opinion to you is that whatever you do,try not to read this book. I know you won't like it. I know I didn't."
3,Not very interesting,"I was to read Fahrenheit 451 for a book report in class. This book was not all that good but it brought out some specific details that the people on earth should really think about. Things such as reading and thinking for themselves. It also shows how the world would be if people don't stop taking books for granted and start reading and understanding these things because they can really help you out in the world today. This book wasn't really good but it made me think. Some people I know never read a book in their life because they say they are boring or the fact that they don't have time to read. At times, I'm like that. But I know and understand the importance of reading. Eventhough what I am saying isn't anything about the book, I'm just str8ning the facts."
3,Firey novel that perplexes the masses doesn't do it for me,"Bradbury's attempt to pull us into a futuristic world juxtaposed with elements of the early half of this century did amaze me. It was an easy read, but I found that some people have expanded the meanings of this novel through a bizarre form of free-flowing symbolism. They have deemed it a modern American Literature Symbolism Bible, a title that I personally abhor. It's a good book, but not one of such importance that one should completely be absorbed in its meaning weeks after reading. This book's portrayal of Dentim's Dentifrice could be the key to understanding life, but I seriously doubt it."
2,The book shows a bleak vision of the future of the world,"The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book ."
2,"Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain","I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering ""wait... what happened?"". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound."
4,Surprise--it's pretty good,"As an English teacher, I felt like a loser because I had never read FAHRENHEIT 451, so I picked up a copy and read it.It's pretty good. I guess I avoided it because it was written by Ray Bradbury and I didn't consider him an accomplished author. Now I do. The book just might surprise you. It is science fiction at its best."
2,ahhh it is alright,this book was really boring and i had to read it for a book report so instead of me reading the whole book i just rented the movie from blockbuster and watched the movie it was much easier
2,Fell short of expectations&#65533;,"I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me."
2,An OK book,"Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous."
2,A major dissapointment,"I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. So, I decided to read it. I was very dissapointed. Though some concepts were fairly interesting they were not developed, so book had no point. I cannot understand why this novel is as famous as it is. Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451."
