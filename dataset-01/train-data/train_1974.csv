5,great book,"I'm not sure if this is all real but I'm going to say so,this is a great read if you watch movies like Shaun Of The Dead, and great for some scarey campfire/sleepover style nights"
4,Interesting subject and very amusing...,this book is very funny and quite amusing in its in-depth description and outlandish scientific facts. My husband enjoyed it very much and reads me the almost real and quite believable stories of zombie encounters. A good book for the young at heart and the science-fiction buffs.
1,A false witness is far from the truth,"This book is the absolute closest to being excrement that is possible. I believe that the author should undergo a psychiatric assessment immediately, and Amazon should at least place a warning upon it. It is presented as authentic, but is clearly fictitious."
2,Hard to Classify,"I checked this book out from the library, (the rating would have been lower if I had bought it) and I was disappointed. Even on the book jacket it is listed as a ""humor"" book, but it is not even remotely funny. Some people claim it is a parody, but even as a parody I don't find this funny. It seems to me like the author is trying way too hard to create something that isn't meant to be taken seriously. Even for lovers of zombie films, this book is too verbose and isn't worth shelling out the dough for."
2,slightly disappointed,"I thought the book would be rather humorous considering the fact that it is classified as ""humor"" but the author writes almost in a technical sense as though zombies actually exist. Therein lies the ""humor"" I suppose, but I was still disappointed."
1,Waste of money!,"What a waste of money and time. This guy is way TOO serious, and from this boring survivalist guide, seen too many Romero movies. He claims zombies are real and his findings are based on real incidences. Fear not, many have checked his sources and found they are all ficticious. Well, with a father like Mel Brooks, what can you expect.Don't waste your money. See Night of the Living Dead instead."
2,"Knock, Knock... Who's There... Zombies","Zombies make honey and others don't. This simple line yields more humor than the entire book. I expected that this would be hilarious because the concept is so ridiculous, but instead the author chooses to write a pseudo-factual book for actual survival. The problem: there are no zombies and we don't really need to prepare. It is weighed down by unimaginative explanations for the genesis and capabilities of zombies. Often, opportunities for creativity or humor are competely missed. Many, if not most questions of how one can avoid infection or conversion are simply answered as ""You can't."" If you are looking for a survival guide, check out the SAS Survival Handbok. If you like zombies get Night of the Living Dead. Waste neither your time nor your money on this book."
4,"Great book, prompt shipping, book did NOT come in mint condition.","Great book:You wouldn't love a great book that (with all that stuff goin' on in Florida) will serve you well in the future.Prompt shipping:Book came very fast (under 5 days after I bought it).Book did NOT come in mint condition:This upset me. The front and back covers were slightly bent, also there was a crease where it looked like it has been dropped.Over all, if you arnt petty about the condition about the book, buy it!"
3,eh......,I like the idea of it. but i thought this book would be a story. instead its a guide. I think they needed to make this book into a story. but maybe i didnt get that far yet.
4,"Funny, in a practical way!","I gave this book along with the zombie doll. If you like zombies, this will be a hit! Written so seriously, it's funny!! Thumb's up!!"
4,Great book,Gave as a gift for Christmas. They read it in 2 days. Said there was interesting information in it and all were quoted from studies done.
3,Just Ok,"I have had this type of shade by other manufactures on other trucks I have owned. The others covered the windows better, this brand was is a little shallow from top to bottom. I would have liked more coverage. These were easy enough to install, and do the job, could do it a little better."
1,Broken and scratched,Items received in a thin box with no protective packing. Units were scratched and bent when I opened them. On their way back.C'mon people how much is some extra padding? Is it worth the returns?
5,Great shows !,"Honestly, I absolutely cannot understand why these 2 masterpieces by the Gershwins are not part of standars musical repertoire, given the great qualities of the music and the immortal lucidity of the satire of the american political intitutions.Waiting for the next great revival of these shows, Sony should AT LEAST reissue these recordings, which, in spite of the absence of spoken dialogues, are markstones of American musical theater."
5,It is a wonderful musical,I have listened to this musical cd over and over because we are preforming Of Thee I Sing at our High School in PA.....I love it
4,Great toy for any Star Wars fan.,This TIE fighter is a great toy. It has the smaller wings so it isn't huge. It is very durable and the figure looks great too. Brought back great memories as my son gets to relive some of the toys I had when I was little.
1,"Music by and for the ""special""","This sucks in such novel ways that I'm not sure that only 1 star is correct. Maybe it should be 5 simply for putting out some of the rawest, stinkiest mess I've ever heard. I'm confused about this album. Ravishing badness? Is Ildjarn retarded? His ""music"" certainly is. Much of it sounds like white noise with a tiny bit of chordal or melodic structure with smashing trash can lids percussion. Or is that just a distorted drum machine on ""fast rock beat 1""? Sounds like he recorded it on a portable cassette player for that true necro sound, as in unlistenable. Perhaps Ildjarn should just go back to his forest and let us normals go about our lives. This album sucks."
4,Great Product,This piece was exactly what we were looking for. It looks expensive and really well made without paying a fortune. It was easy to assemble. I highly recommend this piece.
3,I Like it,It works pretty good. the best i've used is by pro-mark though. I've been drumming for 7 years. Use pro-mark.
4,Tai Chi Sword - the 32 Form DVD,Very well done. This is a great help in learning and remembering the form while you are studying with a teacher. The main problem is finding a teacher who teaches this form the same way. The detailed instructions and multi-angle video shots do a great job of documenting the form but are no substitute for a good teacher.
2,Very General,This book is so general that you will not learn how to do anything. You will learn the lingo and basic description of auctions and forclosures but it does not go into depth about anything specific. If you have any specific questions and/or research topics this is not the book. If you are completely clueless and never owned a house this is your book.
1,Over simplified and short,"I've read about 6 books on real estate bought from Amazon, and I have to say that this one is the most oversimplified. It is like reading one of those ""pocket MBA"" books, which just tells you terms and procedures. Don't expect to read this book and be able to transact ""foreclosed and bargain homes"". It is far from that! For instance, the chapters on how to identify and find a ""bargain"" home comes down to this: look it up at a bank, MLS, or internet. Heck! I could have told you that for free! Given that that is the most important step, I was really disappointed with this book. Don't waste your money...If you want to buy an overview or basics book on home buying I sugget the ""Unofficial Guide to Buying a Home"" which is much more detailed and straightforward about buying a home. And it covers in better details what are the pitfalls of buying a bargain home."
4,Don't Sleep,"These Red Eye Boys has what it take to be one the big boys. I can't wait until their next album. It's going to be a classic. I had the opportunity to see them perform live, when i was at the impact last year. Order a copy and see what i am talking about."
2,oh brother...,"Here's another example of a potentially great mix -- by a talented group of fellows -- muddied by too many vocal tracks. It may be just me, or I may have just made a bad purchase, but I'm so sick of DJs choosing too many tracks with too many vocals for their mixes. Avoid the diva thing and stick to the music. On a more positive note, the mixing is good (enough raw spots to make it sound legit) and several tracks toward the middle are great. Overall, disappointing for such a ""legendary"" DJ's project."
5,Good As It Gets,"This is it, Truby Trio mixin up a full length set for your listening pleasure. Rainer Truby and Fauna Flash getting together for the good of everyone. This is what is all about, you cant go wrong with these three guys picking the tracks. Cross your fingers and they might come to a city near you!! I have been lucky enough to catch them a couple of times and now to be able to get a copy of this disc!Waiting for the Trio in Southern California."
3,"I really like Rainer Truby, but...","I'm a really big fan of Rainer Truby, but I have to admit that I am a little disappointed with his latest endeavor. Even though the album stays true to Truby form I still seems to be missing that special something that made him one of my favorite dj's to date. If you want to get a feel for what I'm talking about give Rootdown '99(a true classic) a listen to and develop you own opinion. Cheers!"
4,Get the inside facts on how the sun was formed.,"Great old video from Bell Labs. I remember this movie in grade school. Lionel Barrymore, Eddie Arnold and the Sun, discuss what scientists know about the sun. They discuss early man's facination with the sun, and how modern man could not live without the sun. Funny and educational."
2,cheaply made. buggy remote control. not durable.,"The idea of a remote control vehicle that can drive on land and float on water is great. However, this product is not worth the purchase price. One, packaging, vehicle, and remote control all feel cheap and the flimsy. Two, batteries were NOT included. Three, the remote control is not intuitive, and is buggy. Four, it doesn't work well in water. Five, similar to other review, the remote control flakes out after less than 2 weeks."
2,Same problem as everyone else,"I was worried from the beginning when I received a banged up brown cardboard box with the car and remote thrown in plastic bags inside. No packaging. No instructions. Nothing. I removed the car and it was covered in dust. My first thought was that it was used, but after inspecting the wheels, I don't think it was because they were perfect.I put batteries in the remote and let my son play with it. At first it was fun. He ran it around the house and then outside, but within about an hour, the remote stopped working. Changing batteries did no good at all. Save your money."
3,Fun but has definite downsides.,"The idea of this r/c car is great, a car that can go through all terrains. It is a lot of fun to take out and run through snow, water, and mud. My oldest liked the idea that he could run it through everything outside without worrying about it failing, and it held up well to the terrain tests (snow, mud, gravel, and water) we put it through. The main problems I encountered while using this toy with my kids is that the on/off switch on the car fell off, just broke and fell out, and we had to use a small key to flip it on and off from that point on. The batteries drained fairly quickly (within a week with an hour or so of play each day) and the remote didn't get a great range from the car even with brand new batteries. I would not recommend this toy just for the fact that it broke AND drained the batteries so fast."
4,Works okay,"This is a decent toy that works, so far, just like it should. The controls are simple and it is easy for kids to use. It goes in water slowly, but it's kind of cool just because it can go in water. The only negative I have to say about it is I think it should have a little more power, but it seems to be about the same as for other similar toys like this in the same price range. Also, the packaging is a plain brown box. This is probably a good thing because it probably keeps the cost down a smidgin, but if you are giving it for a gift, it just doesn't have a ""wow"" factor package."
3,Defective but fixable,"Like the other reviewers, our hand control stopped working on one side after a week or so. Determined, my husband opened the controller and found that the contacts weren't quite touching on one side. He padded one of the contacts with electrical tape and voila! Now it works just spiffy. Three stars for a very cool tool with a major but fixable defect."
1,It was fun - for about 20 minutes,"I bought this for Christmas and it worked for a little while in the house and we even made it to the pond where it took a spin on the water, as it is supposed to be able to. Well, after about 20 minutes the hand control gave out. It's no longer working and changing the batteries didn't help! Not the kind of present I want to give or have my kids receive!!"
2,disappointed,"I bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed. It stopped working correctly on one side. The remote may be the problem, I am not sure. We changed the batteries but that did not help. I felt bad I bought him a Christmas gift that didn't last the day!"
1,Total Bust,"Bought this car for my sons Christmas present. Like many others this item looked like a perfect fit. However, it stopped working after less then a day. Now it is useless. What a waste of money."
3,Morphibian the battery eater,"We love the ""cool"" factor of this remote control vehicle but it slows down after a short time as it uses up its batteries. Recommend using rechargables to help it stay fun for longer."
3,Check the frequency if you buy more than one!!!!,"I bought two of these, the gator and the stingray for my kids for christmas. I was thinking how much fun they would have racing these around the house and outside in the creek together. After we get the batteries in we find that they are on the same frequency, so you one controller will control both cars. so forget about playing together. I am disappointed that in the product description there is NO warning about this. So I contacted Kid Galaxy and they have 6 different morphibian cars with 2 different frequencies, the shark, cobra and rover(10136) all have 49mhz and the gator, rover(10162) and stingray are 27mhz. So if you are buying for 2 kids make sure you order different ones. I am going to see if I can exchange one!"
3,dave cooper does it again,"the story, very good. one drawback: cooper is really stingy when it comes to drawings concerning big butt lucsious babes. but when he does grace us; it's worth the wait. if you like underground comics, this is a rarity indeed!"
4,Innocent fun?,"This is a short stream-of-consciousness graphic novel featuring talking animals, angry lesbians, and a lot of nipples. Dave Cooper is a strange combination of Walt Disney and William Burroughs. He uses funny animals and balloon-shaped people to depict a world of organic machines and imminent violence. It's funny and disturbing at the same time, with some sort of childhood sexuality under the surface. I highly recommend it to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and an open mind."
5,A great score...,"I have not seen this show, and I've heard that the book was what made it flop, but oh, my! That music. I think ""Rags"" is my favorite song; Judy Kuhn is ridiculously talented. I've never heard so much sincere emotion poured into a song in my life, besides maybe John Cameron Mitchell or Bernadette Peters. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys ""epic"" musicals with a bit of an emotional edge. I'm so glad I bought this CD, it's quickly becoming one of my favorite musical scores of all time. It has a bit of a Disney feel to it, which is unfortunate, but overall it's amazing, complex, heartfelt music."
3,The delightful Judy Kuhn,"I can never hear enough of Judy Kuhn, and I've bought every recording of hers that I can find including this sleeper, which apparently ran on Broadway for about 10 minutes. I can't understand that; the subject seems a natural for Broadway and the show boasted some great talent. Judy sings the title song, and in that four minutes you get the show in a nutshell. I'm guessing that her character's untimely demise might have led to the show's demise. In any event, the melody is surely one of Strouse's most intriguing, and she does it great justice with her miraculous voice. She's a Broadway diva in the best sense, and just for this song it's worth having the disc."
3,Just alright for me....,"This seems to be the clash of two big names in the musicals world. On there own both Charles Strouse and Stephen Schwartz are amazing but together the result isn't all that good.This recording isn't a bad recording, actually there are wonderful highlights on this recording. But as a CD on the whole there are many songs that are dissapointing. The actors are amazing though just the material is often shabby.Great songs like ""Rags"" (Judy Kuhn is the best one on this recording), ""Blame it on a Summer Night"", ""Easy for You"", ""Wanting"" and ""The Sound of Love. But be careful for some other songs, they can be painful."
4,easy to assemble,"looks just like to picture, easy to asemble(we are not ""handy"" people), safety hinge, my daughter loves it and could not wait to store all her dress-up clothes in it!"
4,It is a good mic,"When I swap it out on camcorders like the JVC GZGX1BUS, SAMSUNG S10, the audio gain is slightly lower than I would wish, but I am sure, great for a H2N ZOOM, or the TASCAM PR-10. Works as shotgun, eliminates side sounds."
5,Bryanna Phillips LOVES!!!! THIS MOVIE!!!,This is my wife's FAVORITE movie.....!!! I also enjoyed it. I would say it is worth the watch. True Story.
1,"Poorly written, woe is me tale","I wanted to like this book. I was looking forward to some light summer reading and hoped this would be the ticket. It is light - on substance - and the writing is truly horrendous. The book is replete with typos and poor grammar. I understand wanting Daly's ""voice"" to come through in the writing, but at times, the folksy, down home, grammatically incorrect language is overbaked. I came away not liking John Daly the person. The book is full of self-pity and Daly seems to revel in his faults. I was very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend buying this book. There are much better ways to spend your time and money this summer. The only good aspect of the book is that it is an incredibly quick read."
2,Daly's confessions,This is a sad autobiography from a man who could have excelled at a sport but failed to. He is admittedly self-destructive and the story is not all that fascinating. I'm glad I bought a used copy for very little.
2,Addictive Behaviour?,"Entertaining easy to read book but not very likely to fetch a Nobel Prize.Interesting why Daly would want to make reference to several incidents of drunken driving and sad that he doesn't seem to feel particularly responsible for many of his own actions as an adult.In my opinion the book reflects a considerable amount of raw untreated addictive behaviour and it kept me sober for a few days, thanks John."
1,Poor Johnny,"Yet another fallen star collecting coin with a sob-story tell-some (not tell-all) book. I wouldn't put a penny into this poor, poor former pro golfer's wallet. Please save your hard earned dollars and contribute to the local children's shelters or cancer fund before you elect to support John's pathetic habits. Those of us who save every extra dollar for our children's next birthday gift will pray for men like John, but will not peer into his soul for entertainment."
2,Liberace rides again?,"I have owned this record for a little over a week, and, after repeated listening in the car, while commuting, have to say, that I don't find that it bears listening to alone, despite my love for solo keyboard, from Bach to Brahms to Scriabin to Jarrett. Now, maybe, if you are a single guy or gal, and want some mood setting couch listening music that won't get in the way of ""meaningful conversation"" as foreplay, this might be just the ticket. Kind of like taking a date to see Franco Zeffirelli's ""Romeo & Juliet"" in my time. One thing positive I can say is that the piano sound is well recorded. However, the music does not stand on its own merits. Never the less, it might be useful as good candle light, or couch music. Use your thousand words to inform the amazon.com community of your luck in this regard!"
3,Little overrated,This John McArthur cd is a nice listen but I prefer the consistency of Van Cliburns cds. This is more interpretive while Cliburn sticks to the classical style that the music was written in. Still a very nice cd. Different from what other reviewers say I don't need to be with someone to enjoy this:-). My cd was shipped from the UK. I lucked out here.
1,Please!,"This is the perfect cheese manufacturing disc. I guess all thesentimental masses without a shred of culture will buy this disc,alas. And how stupid that fanatic supporters of this disc write reviews elsewhere saying that this disc is the ""only"" one that tops artists such as Ax, Zimerman, and so on. What an insult to good music-making! Music is NOT wallpaper -- it does not exist to make you relax, or to make you fall asleep. Don't think that buying this disc makes you more ""cultured"" -- quite the opposite, in fact! END"
5,Just about perfect,"Now and then a smaller company issues a modest recording that turns out to be so beautiful that one simply wants to tell friends to get a copy right quick. Such is <Hidden> on a new (to me) label called Boston & Blue Street Records (BAB10977). The concept is simple. Pianist John McArthur plays 11 pieces, most of which are transcriptions, and plays them very well. Four of the transcriptions of Rachmaninoff songs are by John Tibbatts (getting their world premier on this CD); three of Bach, Faure and again Rachmaninoff are by Earl Wild; one of Tchaikovsky by Rachmaninoff himself; and one of Schubert by Liszt. As you can see, many are ""drawn from the legacy of rarely performed treasures of piano literature"" (as the press release says), such as Liszt's ""Funerary Rites"" and the lovely Moszkowski transcription of Offenbach's ""Barcarolle."" This would make a wonderful gift so get a few of them."
4,Hidden: Out into the Light,This is a really beautiful CD that was a surprise no matter how you look at it. Who is this pianist and where has he been hiding? There's power here not to mention an ability to connect with the listener. The Rachmaninov/Tibbatts selections are fabulous not to mention his playing of Earl Wild's pieces. This music follows you throughout the day even when it's not being played on the stereo. A refreshing packaging of classical music. WOW!
5,Unearthing Hidden,"As a lover of classical music, it's always exciting to discover a contemporary artist who can sift through notes on a page and awaken the soul of a piece in the manner in which the composer intended. This is the reaction to John McArthur's recent offering. The title encapsulates both the seasoned artist emerging into the limelight and the sublime textures he releases from the music. A must have for any serious student of music."
1,All Night Waste,"Wow! four movies for just ...! Even at that price you are paying too much. The first two use stock footage plus repeated footage of a stripper (who doesn't take it off) wrapped around a one page script. The second pair of titles have a somewhat larger budget, but it wasn't for the script. If you want a low- budget T&A comedy flick look elsewhere. The quality of the DVD is as low as the quality of the film itself."
4,Review Wenger Aquagraph Deep Diver,"Overall this watch model is extremely well built. One of the best built case and bracelet I have seen.I have seen many of these watches around and there seems to be a quality issue when it comes to the face plate and hands to line up with the watch itself. So far I have not found any that line perfectly. If you can live with this I highly recommend this watch.For the price, it is one of the best values out there."
4,Well Made and good looking,"Nice watch, waterproof to 1000mt. That made the crown a bit hard to open first time. I actually had to get a pair of needle nose pliers onto it to unscrew it.Now, I don't do it up so tight as I am not diving.The watch has great luminosity, glows clear all night.Only thing I would like to see is a stronger ratchet on the outer crown as even wearing the watch to bed I will find the crown has turned. I would not like that to happen while diving and find I have been cut short on diving time..Some people remark on the weight as it is quite a large heavy watch but you get used to it.Otherwise, a great watch."
1,Would have been a nice watch!,"Received my watch today.....I have rated it as ""nice watch"" and probably given it 4 stars had it not been shipped to me as someones return. The metal band was on backwards, the links looked as though they were previously sized, they were scratched, there was no tag on the watch nor any protective plastic on it. The back of the case showed signs of wear.....IE: smudges. Hmmm .....so much for thier quality control. I orderd the same watch from another company! Pretty sad...John"
5,Love this product!,"This product is great! It makes my hair silky soft and smooth, even when used wet or dry, and it only take a tiny amount so one bottle will last FOREVER. Great price too!"
2,Too Heavy for me,"I have to use anti-frizz on my hair. This product was too heavy and left my hair looking and feeling greasy. I have another brand now that soaks right into my hair which I will continue to use. This product may work better for coarse, thick curly hair. I would not purchase this again."
1,Waste of money,"I have thick, curly hair that's very prone to frizz so after this being recommended to me, I thought I'd try it. I was disappointed. It made my hair greasy, even when I didn't use a lot, and did absolutely nothing for frizz or fly-aways. A total waste of my money. It's the same story with the FX Curls Up curl activator too."
4,great pics,"this book is not meant to be a great read, it is however a great picture book. excellent pics of the important people who created punk. patti smith, richard hell, just to name 2."
2,Nice pictures of NYC punk in-crowd in 1970s,"This is a picture book, and it's got nice pictures. But this is about a few celebrities in the punk and new wave scene in 70s New York. It has virtually no text, and offers almost no insight into the feeling, the sounds, the pulse, the texture of punk and new wave. There are scarcely any fans or everyday people--just some photos of Richard Hell and the like. Few people will relate to this book or be glad that they bought it (and naive punks who think punk=mohawks will be sorely soured). For a much more comprehensive look at this influential music scene, you're better off with Clinton Heylin's __From the Velvets to the Voidoids__."
1,Great document of a magic era!,"This book looks at a cool time for rock and roll.Even better is ""High On Rebellion;Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic FRogs, Jayne County,Cherry Vanilla,etc.THE REAL SCENE!"
4,Greatest Skate Video... Ever!,"This could very well be the best UMD you will ever see. The sound is amazing, as if I'm skating alongside these extremists and the video quality is better then most of the major studio UMD's. It's only a matter of time before the DC Video becomes a staple to your home video collection."
4,DC Video,"This DVD features some excellent skate footage. However, it's not long enough (only 40 mins) and the accompanying booklet, advertised at 86 pages long, was only 8 pages. Slight error there. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Because the level of skating is so good.Son of Decorum"
3,kids ok,they watched 4 a little while my grandson wanted it n got ti 4 him but lost intersit not 4 kids
2,Not for children!,I bought this for my 9 year old and it was not made for a boy of that age due to the actions of the skaters. Recommended for older teenagers.
1,Mucha música...,"Lo siento mucho pero no puedo recomendar este video.Pensé que iba a poder ver largas secuencias y trucos, pero sólo encontré mucha música y muchos accidentes."
1,thimble or lampshade,I ordered a lampshade but got a thimble. You should give measurements when you sell items.I even email a precautionary note which went unanswered because i know that on mail orders thimbles are frequently substituted for lamp shades.
4,swwword,"this game was pretty good,considering its a gameboy game(i wanted to give it 4and a half stars but didnt know how)the plot isnt anything too original or extremely complicated(why are magic,swords,and barging into people's houses so popular anyway? )but,still a good game.I bought it for vacation and its really keeped me entertaned.You walk at a fast pace wich is really good and its easy to understand how the game works.If you want a pretty good game and like magicy and swordy stuff EAT MY LUNCH just kidding, give this game a try"
4,A really good game boy game for RPG,"This game is really good if you like RPGs. I'm new to RPG playing, but this is the best game I have written. I love having to explore everywhere to find everything you need. I love the fighting that is involved. Hack-and-slash is one of my favorite things. I also love learning all of the spells and talking to everyone. The only problem I have is that it takes a while to get to all of the new towns, especially if you stop to fight all of the monsters that you meet. I recommend this game for anyone, and everyone, who likes RPG."
1,Terrible rip off of Zelda,"This game cand not be compaired to Zelda. Just can't, and you know why. Because this is nothing of the a third rate game with dum monsters and no skill once or ever. Play The first Zelda game. Its way more easy."
2,Not as good as the original,"This game was one of my all-time favorite games for the old Nintendo Entertainment system, so I was very happy to hear that NST was remaking the game for the Game Boy color. However, this version of the game spoils pretty much everything that was good about the original. The game holds your hand every step of the way. This new ""feature"" might be great for your average 5 year old, but it greatly tones down the difficulty and removes all sense of freedom and exploration. Also, the great music from the original has been removed and replaced with garbage. If you want to play a good version of Crystalis, play the NES version. If you want a good adventure game for your Game Boy, buy Zelda. As it is, this version of the game is a disappointment, so I can't recommend it."
1,Terrible!,"Do not waste your time! This poorly written, (Was it written or made up as they went?)so called documentary, is characterized by non professional filming and acting.I only gave it one star because they apparantly were smart enough to get a dealfor Amazon to distribute this garbage! I wasted money as I could not watch it a3rd of the way through."
3,wonderful story.,"the novelette undine is a must read-- it is available online in complete for those wishing to read it before purchasing. the wittiness of the writing, and the tragic tale of true love is something lost in modern versions of fairy tales.this version is an excellent translation of the german, with layered subtleties of meaning in the text.the reason i only gave three stars to this version is that, in the preview, it shows the illustrations. the book i received is the same text, but lacks the drawings and layout of the novelette shown. i would have saved five dollars and bought the other available amazon version, which does show this."
4,One of my favorite possessions,"I bought a pair for my sound-sensitive sister, but I ended up just keeping it. I love them! I live with noisy people and there's nothing like slipping on a little serenity. Can't beat the price!"
4,Good quality ear protection.,I used these at the gun range a couple of times and they work great. I did have a little trouble keeping them in place while shooting skeet. Good quality materials and construction. Two thumbs up!
5,"Wonderful, inspirational and heart-warming stories","Too often we are busy ""making a living"" while spending precious little time in ""making a life."" Brad and Sherry Hansen-Steiger, in their new book, ""Christmas Miracles"" show us that there is much more to life than appears to be. I found myself almost on the brink of tears as I read story after story. I was gently reminded to look at the important things in my life and to always know that there is a purpose and a plan for each of us. My thanks to the authors for such a wonderful volume. I will keep it in my library as one of my most precious books."
4,Levant had better recordings!!!!,"The ultimite recording of Rhapsody in Blue was a recording Paul Whiteman did with Oscar Levant for Columbia in the early 40's. That recording was in Mono and has long been unavailible appearing only once on LP. On the recording for sale here, the orchestra cannot keep pace with Levant! It's sad.Levant was the most underrated romantic pianist of the 20th century. Listen to some of his other recordings! I recommend this recording because the Whitman / Levant recordings are not around. Listen to the little bits of music in the movie Rhapsody in Blue. Big difference from what you hear here!"
2,Sound Quality Holds Back Levant the Genius,"No one on earth can play like Levant. The world is a much sadder place without this wonderful talent. Too bad the producers of this recording buried him with poor sound quality. Yes, I played the CD in various players, from the cheapest boomboxes to expensive sets. Still sounded muffled and no dynamics were evident. Really inhibited this great man's chops. Gershwin and Levant deserve better mastering and recording, emmis..."
3,Mixed Bag,"Unfortunately the sound in the first 2 pieces (Rhapsody In Blue & Second Rhapsody For Piano and Orchestra) is terrible, and in the remaining musical selections is only passable. This is so unfortunate knowing the caliber of musicianship involved. I saw the movie based on George Gershwin's life with my parents when it came out in the '40s & other films Oscar Levant was in & have fond memories of his playing expertise and was really looking forward to owning this CD, but was sadly disappointed because of the inferior sound quality.Instead, I highly recommend the excellent album of Gershwin's music played by Michael Tilson Thomas. Also, there are 2 albums available reproducing the playing of Gershwin himself from piano rolls."
5,Love Smokin Joe and Bnois!,Most underated blues act that I have ever heard. Seen them In Chicago at Buddy Guys and they are FANTASTIC! BUY ALL OF THIER CD'S!
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""THEIR HEART MAY BE IN TEXAS, BUT THEIR BLUES ARE IN INTENSIVE CARE!""","Let me start this review, by saying, I have 7 other CD's by this combo, and this will probably be my last. In my constant search for some string bending, voice growling, blues, I keep getting disappointed by this combo. I got hooked by the first CD of theirs I bought ""Road House Research"", which had some potential, but things never got better, either by buying all their older ones OR all their new ones. I will admit Smoking Joe shows a little stronger guitar on this CD as compared to the others. Bnois, just has a voice with no growl, it's too placid, tranquil... like white noise. It never resurrects, images of ""da blues""."
4,This is an excellent book for advanced DSP topics,"This book has great material on least squares filtering and spectral estimation techniques. And with Hayes providing the Matlab code to implement the formulas, it is a great help to the student in being able to run the code and see what the outputs should look like. The book reads well and is very easy to use. But it is not a substitute for an intro DSP book like Oppenheim/Schafer or Proakis.Update - I have changed my score from 4 to 5. The longer I have been working to more I find I use this book and the examples in it to do things. I think this is a really useful book for a practicing engineer."
5,The Best book,"This is the best book to understand the statistical digital signal processing, in a clear step-by-step mode.It should be the first book to read on the matter.Thank you Prof. Hayes, you wrote a great book."
5,Remembering Revell Model Kits,"This book is just fantastic. It's a great reference - but most of all, it's a wonderful trip down memory lane."
3,Lacking in some areas,I bought this book because I was a model freak back in the 60's and early 70's. It brought back some pleasant memories however some of the art could have been printed better. Also some of the opinions on the kits were a little off base.
1,IT's Junk,"IT Stays Body Adhesive doesn't stay, well at least on me. I put it on completely dry skin but within less than an hour of use, the adhesive wasn't sticking. Apparently, the body's natural oils and sweat makes this item not work the way it's supposed to. It's a bit of a gooey mess as well. You have to turn the roll-on ball with your finger to get it to move because it sticks to the opening of the bottle. Therefore, you get the sticky goo all over your fingers. Luckily, it washes off easily with water. Plus as I said before, it washes off easily with your sweat and natural body oils. So unless you have dry skin all day, this won't work."
3,Great for light items,"I purchased this item in conjunction with some breast forms because so many others had purchased this at the same itme.It is a great product for lightweight items. The problem I had with it is that it intitially would help me position and keep my forms in place but if the adhesive got damp it would release.Conclusion, great for keeping clothes and lightweight items in place but I'd recommend you consider how heavy the items are you will be using this product with and whether the product will get damp with use, such as on a hot day or in a swim suit.All in all, a good product for the correct application."
5,Love this product,"This product is fantastic. I have tried many others,but this is the best. It rolls on clear,holds things tightly yet does not leave a residue. It takes very little product to hold. The slight medicinal smell goes away after applying. It even holds necklaces in place on clothing!!! Very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend this product. It was even cheaper with shipping than some of the others I tried."
2,unhappy with results,"It does stay somewhat won't hold a size five tear drop breast form, can,t go braless.shipping was almost the cost of the breast forms"
5,"""IT Stays"" and it works!","Does just what it says it does- keeps straps and wigs in place.Just wipe it on and stick in place. Doesn't drip, rolls right on and comes off with warm water and doesn't stain."
3,Wish It Stayed Longer,The IT Stays Roll-On Body Adhesive holds my garment down for several hours but I must press the garment down with my hand throughout the day. For that reason I gave it 3 stars. I cautiously recommend this item.
1,Very dissatisfied,"This product took too much time to adhere a support stocking to my calf. When I finally applied enough to do the job, it was messy. Worst product of this kind I have ever used. Will not buy it again."
2,Didn't Work,I got this to help keep my wig in place. It didn't work for me. Will try to find another use for it.
3,so so,It stays till you sweat... and it gets every where. Will try the medical adhesive next time.not so good
5,"Stays on, Roll-on adhesive","I have to wear surgical stocking because of vericose veins in both of my legs & knew of this product from when I was in the medical field. Can not recommend this product enough for those who must wear stockings & have problems with them staying up. I do a lot outdoors & walking with my dog & couldn't get thru any of it without this adhesive. Priced this product at several local medical supply stores & other sources & have found here at Amazon the best price. I ordered several at a time, which last a long time for me & save a bundle."
1,Don't hold,I tried it twice on my artificial foam breasts. Don't hold. Would not recommend purchase purchase of this item. I've had good luck so far on amazon.com; until now.
2,It really does not work,"After you sweat a bit it comes off, so it's really better to continue using the tape kind. It really does not work as advertised."
4,It Stays ~ works,This product does work quite nicely. A little pricy but you do get a bottle with a lot in it.
3,"good glue, but not as good as I'd want","I love this product when I need to keep my chicken cutlets in place- since I unfortunately need them lol, what it doesn't do too well in my opinion is keep bra straps up (for very long, anyway) and that is my primary need in concern with this product. Double-sided tape doesn't seem to work for me( it shows and unglues fairly easily) It's fun using this though, I wish I could think up more things to glue on to my body! :-p"
2,"Might work on clothes, but not for fake beards","As a professional Santa with a fake beard I'm always looking for a good way to attach my beard. I bought this thinking the roll on application would make it easy, and it did, unfortunately the product was not tacky enough to attach the beard. For me, I needed something quick to apply and held up. This did not work out for me at all."
2,Maybe expected too much from it?,"Based on a suggestion from a customer's review, I bought the product to be used in helping to hold up thigh high compression stockings. It did not work for me!Maybe it can be used for something with less pull/tension.At the moment I have no idea what I can use the product for; maybe my daughters will be able to think of something for themselves, being nearly 70 years old I can't envision needing it for anything!It might be ok for decollete use!"
5,mommy must have,"I am a 32 DD and use it to hold my tank tops in place so I can chase my 4 very active kids on the playground without fear of a wardrobe malfunction. It is also fantastic at holding my bikini in place, so we can build castles and play all afternoon without having my suit ride up or expose anything. WONDERFUL, AMAZING PRODUCT!!! Every mom should have it!"
1,don't sweat,"Amazon advertises this product to be purchased together with breast forms. It doesn't work for that purpose. It's not the companies fault,they never state that it will adhere breast forms. The directions say that this adhesive can be removed from your skin with just plain water. That is correct. It also means that if you sweat, the adhesive will not hold. Your sweat washes it away and your boobies will fall to the floor!(oops) Trust me, you will sweat with silicone against your body. Be aware of products that amazon puts together, giving you the impression that you will need this extra item. It's just a ploy to sell you something you don't really need.(I've come across this scam with them before. This product does work well if all your trying to do is keep an article of clothing in place. Like a strap, or a neckline from exposing too much."
5,It really works,It Stay's actually works. I purchased it because I had sclerotherapy and had to wear support hose. My support hose were not the best and would roll down every time I walked. It Stay's actually kept my support hose in place and it stays in place all day! This is a great adhesive.
2,IT Stays adhesive.,This product is supposed to prevent support belts from shifting. It had very little effect on my hernia support belt and it continues to shift. It may be because the product will not work for close mesh belts.
4,holds till you sweat,"this is very convenient to use. it rolls on quick and holds well, but it does become unsticky in humid weather where you sweat almost always. so better for dry climates but great for those little jobs where you need something to stay put. it goes on in a nice line and is not messy. great item to have."
3,Doesn't work very well.,"I much prefer topstick to this glue. I thought this would be convenient and easy but when I roll it on, it barely holds my clothes in place. I use it to secure tops but it doesn't work on anything moderately thick and easily loses the stickiness."
3,it can stick fabric well.,I expected it to conceal a scar which it could not. Overall a great adhesive for costume parties and kids dressup..
4,Great Stuff!!!,This is the perfect item for persons wanting to keep their socks up. You dont need a lot but just some will keep them up all day. The only negative (if any) is this product may leave a little cohesivness on your leg but it comes right off in the shower. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to keep clothing secured on his/her body.
2,body adhesive,"does not work well, makes body sweat and item falls off. would not purchase at all, tried it did not like it"
2,Unsticky Product,The ball mechanism does not turn easily and the glue hardly sticks. I found thois product disappointing and a waste of money.;
4,It works!,"I was prescribed gradient compression stockings after having a blot clot in my varicose vein. The tights prescribed to me did not stay up, and the beading wasn't available in the level that I needed. I bought this, and it really works!"
1,Defective packaging - not able to return,Received this product in good time. Just opened it to try it out before a vacation. Found that the safety seal had been broken and the roller ball was jammed way up in the cap. I now find out that I am unable to return it because it is considered hazardous material. This is a good lesson. Never order something liquid that would be considered hazardous.
5,"Great, but does not work with silicone!","I order this product to help some silicone petals adhere better to my skin, and this product does not adhere to silicone AT ALL. But, when it comes to sticking fabric to skin it works very well. It also comes off very easily (and residue free!) with a wet washcloth."
4,Omaha,"I have narrow shoulders and a big bust. Have always had problems with bra straps staying up. I had once found an adhesive through a cosmetic company that worked well but could not find it again. So I searched through Amazon and found the IT Stays Body Adhesive.I have used it several times now and it works well, but not as well as the former product. It definitely holds the straps in place for a while, but after moving around the straps have come ""unstuck."" I am going to try using more adhesive and see how that works. The ""roll-on"" ball is a great way to apply it. You don't end up with tons of goo on your body."
1,Don't buy this 'Body Adhesive',"This item is a joke. Or maybe only good for the polar regions. The reason I cannot recommend this item lies within the fact that the adhesive is not waterproof and thus will dissolve when the user is sweating. Living in Hawai'i, that is a given. But if You live in Iceland it may work."
4,adhesive,I use this product for my compression stockings. It gets sticky as it finishes in the bottle.This helps from the stockings falling down. It gives you comfort all day.
4,Adehesive works!,"This adhesive works. I use it for support stockings. As a warning, if you stretch the stockings too far and then apply it, it will stick and you'll get a welt as the stockings are pulling down and the glue is keeping them right where you thought you wanted them to be."
5,Great Product,"I use this product because I have rounded shoulders and straps do not stay up - bras, slips or camisoles. But they sure do if I use this product! It is wonderful to finally not have to lift straps off my arms all day long or to buy bras that cross over the shoulders but show with the cut of many blouses, dresses and shirts."
1,Did not work very well,"it smells kinda bad and it does not stick well at all, Ive tried it several times with no luck"
1,It Stays-Roll on Body Adhesive,"I bought this to hold a low cut dress in place. It did not work as expected, I followed the directions but it didn't hold any material in place. I would not recommend this product."
2,Doesn't stick very long.,"Used for body application but sweat, even a small amount, caused adhesion to weaken and eventually fail. In the end, I did not like it."
1,Not worth the bottle it's in,"It does not stay. I used to by body glue from Beauticontrol Cosmetics until they discontinued the product. Now, that's a product that worked. It does not matter if you sweat or stay dry simply moving around will cause the garment to become unstuck. It also smells like rubbing alcohol when it is applied."
5,stocking glue,Great stuff!! Works well. easy to apply and washes off soap and water. will certainly buy again and give for gifts
3,Nice,"This product is nice, nothing out of the ordinary. The cross is white on a white background so it is hard to see, as pictured."
5,Perfection as always,"As always, went out and bought Alex's newest CD the minute it was put on the shelf. He just improves upon perfection with every CD. My only disappointment with this CD is the duets. I think they detracted from the performance, rather than enhanced it. Even so, wouldn't give up the CD or DVD for any amount of money, bribes, or weellll....maybe for a date with the ""potrillo perfecto"" himself. Claro."
2,Problems,"This book has problems. The descriptions of functions are uneven and ambiguous, and full of questionable examples. Several of the descriptions of the functions are nothing more than assemblages of quotes and thin paraphrasings from Jung and other authors, strung together into long paragraphs that add up to nothing. The author also seems to have emotional biases toward and away from some types.One good thing about the book is that it quotes extensively from Jung's Psychological Types, and those quotes do make sense. The book would have been much better if he had just quoted all of Jung's work, and left out his own mistakes."
5,An invaluable resource for Type practitioners!,"This is an outstanding book - a must-have tool for type practioners, or anyone wishing to learn about type on a much deeper level.Thompson clearly describes the function-attitudes and provides insightful examples and illustrations that help the reader to quickly understand their dynamic nature and impact on personality.As a type practitioner, I have often struggled when trying to explain the effects of introverted and extraverted attitudes on the use of each function. Thompson has clearly and succinctly described the process so that anyone can easily understand it.I wish someone had mentioned this book to me when I went through the MBTI qualification course - - it would have certainly made it easier to move beyond a basic level of understanding of Type theory!"
4,Couldn't put it down!,Kleier cleverly uses Scripture and history to knit a tale that you begin to believe is true! You'll find yourself dreaming about this book!
4,a barn burner,"a long book, but reads fast hard book to put down constantly throws you curves keeps you on your toes lots of subtle and not-so-subtle innuendoes tricks and thrills good book"
4,an enigmatic story with an interesting twist.,"This story was a blast to read. I took a chance with its purchase, and was thrilled with the outcome. The mysterious beginning, the following chapters which kept me guessing, and finally the profetic, yet supercharged ending. If you're interested in a book that'll make you think, and will keep you hopping from one side of the fence to the other...this is your book."
2,Boorish Nonsense,"This reads like a screed from a New Age born again simpleton. No doubt Christianity needs a comeuppance, but the alternative here is idiocy. I didn't finish the thing because it was completely vapid and banal. Organized religion deserves a horse whipping for its arrogance and this author writes with a wet noodle. Its got to be the worst novel published in years and one of the most overinflated exercises in bad writing, ignorance, and self-hype ever. I wouldn't look for that movie version of this classic until the next millenium."
2,A Shame,"A shame to see a great idea wasted because the author lacks the skill and imagination to bring it off. Anti-religion tireades and tangents don't in themselves enlighten or entertain. James Morrow, master iconoclast could have done wonders here. Definite paperback stuff."
2,okay read,"A little below average (characters, dialog & writing's awful) thriller that is sometimes interesting in spite of a repellant ""religious"" message and drug store philosophy. Not exactly the book of my lifetime. Definitely wait for the paperback or you'll kick yourself."
3,Riveting At Times,"Crude writing and hamhandedness does not prevent this author's message from clobbering the Catholic Church in this longwinded but powerful indictment of the ""sacred."" Rants at times and often gets silly, but a needed expose of Roman superstition, Vatican evil, and the hateful nature of Catholcism."
2,Got to admit they got me!,"Saw this book in the bookstore and checked the reviews here. After reading it, I'd like to know why anyone but disaffected Catholics or bigots would appreciate this sort of trash? Not only badly writen, hateful, ugly, and unpleasant as well."
1,Mind Boggling Is Right,"My jaw literally dropped as I waded through this book's abominable prose and incredible cast of plastic stereotypes. This book is truly an amateur effort that manages to be as pretentious as it is banal. Jeza should have had a lobotomy or at least read the bible(as should the author). Someone must be joking with these ""greatest book I ever read"" reviews. Pretty darn sad."
2,Can I Have My Money Back?,"I will sure take hysterically positive reviews with a grain of salt in the future. This below average potboiler overflows with bad writing and dumb characters. The author forgot the story and ended up writing a long, boring anti-religion screed. Im giving it a 3 because Jeza is a uniquely repellant and hateful messiah. To create her must have taken a concerted effort by the author of this stinkbomb."
3,Cute Idea for Thriller,A pretty good thriller when it isn't trying too hard to be something more. A little too nasty and vicious towards people of faith and farout biblically (one might suspect References to the Politically Correct Bible Stories). A lot of potential lost with a messiah from a test tube who is the airhead version of a feminist. Cute at times but begins to grate.
2,Overwritten and Silly,"I guess some fundamentalists find this book hard to take. Well, it' not that easy for some of the rest of us either. Such a good idea wasted! The author forgets to tell a story and becomes preoccupied with his dislike of religion. After 200 pages, his diatribes get old. The story ends up going nowhere and slowly. I kept expecting it to get better but it just got sillier. This is pretty drab stuff. Not a pleasant reading experience at all."
2,Just What the World Wants to Hear,"The Last Day basically summarizes the New Age movement in America today. It's message tolerance for all religions is exactly what the world wants to hear. But folks, the fact is, their is only one way to salvation: Jesus Christ. We have all fallen short of the glory of God, and their's not a thing we can do to measure up. It is only through God's grace that we can be saved. And that is what the world can't bear to hear. I have to give some credit to Mr. Kleier for literary abilities, but if your looking to this book for spiritual guidance, burn it, and open your Bible to John 3:16."
4,a good read,"This novel is not my normal type of book. It is a very unusual book and I liked it. It had to overcome my skepticism about the topic of the book but it did and I thought the book was a good read.I think that mystery readers and sci-fi readers and some religious people interested in the end of things will find this an interesting read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,"Get it, read it!","Sometimes you come across a book that speaks to you so personally that you can't get it out of your mind. The Last Day is such a novel. The themes in this story are so dead-on relevant to what is happening in the world today that it's as if it is written in response to this morning's headlines. If you are frustrated by all the lies, manipulations and corruption in life, and the fact that nothing ever gets done about it, pick up this book and ventilate. This is everything you wish would happen, but never does. It's a huge bucket of ice water thrown right in the face of all the hypocrites and pompous, stuffed-shirt know-it-alls out there that make life so difficult for the rest of us."
1,Good Lord!,"A let down considering the potential of the topic - Last Judgement. A basic familirity with Revelations might have helped the author out. As it is, this is just a politically correct screed against all faiths with overblown dialogue, a repellant main character, and boring plot.There are attempts for controversy here that are simple bad taste to even agnostics like me. I wish I had waited for the paperback to show up at Goodwill. On second thought, wish I missed it completely."
1,Blah!,"This book was bad. Not only was the plot predictable and the characters flat and stereotypical but the writing was full of cliches and unrealistic dialogue. I read the entire thing and feel like I wasted a lot of time. I liked the idea of the book and some of the messages of the ""Messiah"" as well as thinking about what I would really believe if the Messiah did come again during my lifetime, however at times I cringed at the descriptions of the characters and the things they said. The ending was completely lame and unbelievable. I didn't like or empathize with any of the characters and didn't really care what happened to them.My advice: ignore the hype and don't waste your time on this book."
2,Long and Silly,"This was not one of the better plotted thrillers I've read and it's terribly wordy. The author's sparse knowledge of the Middle East was distracting and he seemed overwhelmed by his subject at times. The critical approach toward the Church was refreshing, but it went on far too long and lacked research. The weakness of characters was particularly hard to take. I found myself quickly skimming pages, especially during a lot of the silly sermons delivered by Jeza (she is the worst part of the book). The media frenzy surrounding the millenium was interesting, but could have been better written. The ending was a real fizzle and by the time I finally reached it, it was clear that little could be expected. In fact, the target readers of this book appear to be those with small expectations. It does have offbeat humor, but it was where the writer attempted to be profound that the novel was really funny. Some of the dialog was so bad it had to be a joke."
5,A 10-plus! Humongously entertaining....,"One heck of a novel. The best I've read in many a moon. I've already got a line on who would be a mesmerizing Jeza in the movie version - Kate Winslet. She would be simply smashing. C'mon, bestseller lists out there! Why isn't this great book on any of them?? Thanks, Mr. Kleier for a terrific novel. The only thing that could top it would be a sequel (hint, hint! ;))"
5,Great story!,"They don't come any more exciting than this. From the first page, this novel sizzles along at a dizzying pace, taking you on one wild ride into the unknown. The detail is astonishing. I can't imagine the hours of research that went into developing the plotline, but it is very well thought out, very tight. It's that attention to detail that gives this story such realism. The ""What if?"" scenario is completely credible. The suspense is unbearable. If you enjoy thrillers, this one delivers, and with a slam dunk ending you cannot anticipate. Two thumbs up."
4,"Involving, touching, exhilarating!","I found this book VERY hard to put down. The several engrossing plots, the numerous strong and intriguing characters expertly portrayed, and the spiritual, moral and earthly issues so vividly explored combined in a surprising emotional catharsis for this reader.I was strongly drawn in by the early biotech aspects of this story, captured by the rapid and rapidly developing action, and completely absorbed by the evolving religious dilemmas, questions posed, answers given and profound expression of insight and faith.This book will slake your many thirsts; it is gratifying to the heart, the mind, the body and the soul. It provides much to ponder that is relevant to our true lives and worthy of serious consideration.Which ever you crave, good strong characters involved in high adventure, a glimpse of what the near future might hold, grist for your mind and heart to mull over, you'll happily find it here.Highly recommended!"
1,Don't Expect too Much,It's been a while since I paid for a hardcover just because the story idea was hard for me to resist. I should have thought more about some of bad reviews that turn out to be so right. The idea of a female savior sounds good but this book drops the ball. A really stupid story and awful writting.
2,I Gave Up,"After 200 pages of pseudointellectual pistol whipping, I quit reading. Kleier feel compelled to drive his point home-organized religion stinks- by beating you over the head with Jeza's incessant twaddle about Church misjustice. It wasn't long before I was fairly worn out and sick of Jeza. I would like some decent storytelling to ease the pain of the lectures. The point had been made clear, repeatedly, and there was a whole lot more book to go! No thanks."
3,Big Deal!,"So the religious radical right find it threatening to their calcified beliefs and the liberals think it's the greatest book they ever read. Both groups miss the point! This book is an overlong, overblown, and poorly penned mishmash of a thriller that is relying solely on a cooked-up controversy as a sales pitch. There is really nothing controversial here, and nothing particularly interesting or entertaining. To both sides of the issue: it's a second rate thriller and a gimmick! You have been taken in by a little bit of hype if you believe half of what has been said about this dopey novel."
2,Fair but Unfair,"Seemed like an average thriller to me, distinguished by the author's personal vendetta against Catholics (which actually finds some support from reviewers). Otherwise, there's nothing special about this book from many other assembly line thrillers that have been ground-out by hacks to cash in on y2k fever. This one happens to play to the crowd with a popular prejudice. As to the anti-establishment rebel messiah, I preferred the original:)"
4,One Cool Book!,"I don't read much fiction so I can't compare it to a lot of thriller or science fiction or whatever category this would be put in, but I really enjoyed it! It's especially an improvement over the childish LEFT BEHIND series that is currently burning up the charts. I could never predict what was going to happen and especially loved a lot of the scenes in the Vatican. I'm not sure I believe some of the reviewers here who are treating this book like a new bible. I hope they're being facetious."
2,Ponderous,"I think this novel is a dreadful, pretentious bore. I can live with the twenty cent theology lesson, but where was an editor? This seems to have tumbled out of the press like a road apple from a pony's rear-end. Lousy writing and editing really ruin books for me and this one is a lost cause. The author had something Important to say and he makes it clear we must listen. What astonishes is that a publisher can confuse ponderous with profound and have such rock-bottom standards."
5,Damn good page turner,"Couldn't put it down. If you got two days to spare, pick this up and read it. A great story with a terrific payoff ending. Defintely a book with a kick to it."
3,Garden-Variety,"Fair to middling. Dean Koontz does this kind of thing a lot better. A few too many stereotypical villains and the plot gets outrageous. Awfully long and drags at times. Has an interesting central premise but the writer seems to lose focus. The ending is a bit too zany. OK for a horror/thriller easy read. Definitely not anything special, but then I read a lot."
2,Disappointing,"I would have enjoyed it more if the author had created a more plausible messiah character. The whole story hinges on her and the fact she was hatched in a laboratory is a bad start. She is also unlikeable and hateful at times. Her tedious condemnation of world religion would have been better if it had been done with some compassion. Without any emotion and no sign of a caring nature, how could such a cold oddball be accepted as a ""savior"". The story is most interesting when it depicts the kind of media event the turn of the century may be. But with the centerpiece of the book being so off the wall (and biblically ignorant) it's just impossible to get into the story. A big disappointment to say the least."
3,Heavyhanded but Interesting,"A great idea (Jesus as female Jeza) is too heavyhanded to be really entertaing but is still interesting. The reaction of the church seems overdone and Jeza isn't what one would hope for (lab created and slightly kooky). Institutional religion takes a beating but comes out more sympathetic than Jeza and her fans. Kleier is a talented writer and shows some real potential. First time out though, maybe he took on too big a topic. Still, not so bad."
3,Not Bad,"Above average suspense novel has some interesting things to say about the media and its view of religion. The atmophere of the last day of the 20th century is well presented. Story gets bogged down when the author got too preachy about his anti-religious bias. Seemed shaky theologically speaking, but you don't expect some kind of spiritual experience from something like this. Could have used a little more action and fewer long speeches. Not bad, but not a book I would recommend spending the hardcover price on."
3,"Ok, but could have been better","As the millenium approaches, it would appear that the second coming of Jesus has become the new literary fad among fiction novelists. Overall it was an alright book, the action was good, but the plot could have been sharpened by paying more attention to Biblical facts. Readers may want to read two other ""Resurrectionist"" thrillers, THE RETURN by Joe De Mers and SAINT by Mark Bailey to compare."
5,Great fun!,"I very much enjoyed this book! A rollicking good adventure with an immensely interesting and original storyline. This is a fast-paced novel, but it's not exactly what you'd call light-weight reading. The story craftily weaves a lot of very controversial, contemporary issues into its plot, and it does so with great skill. Before you even realize it, you have a lot of emotions invested and a dozen burning questions in your head you can't wait to get resolved. Few novels tempt and tease like this one does, leading you on like a cunning pied piper. Not for the faint-hearted, but if you can hold on, it roars to satisfying, fulfilling ending thatleaves you gasping for more!"
2,Fair,"Not bad for a thriller but a bit pretentious. The author's New Age nonsense tends toward the annoying as do the ill-defined characters. The book is far too long and the ending is simply not worth waiting for. The kind of thing one picks-up in a bus station to slog through on a very long, monotonous trip."
3,A HUGE AND EXCITING BUILD UP TO A WEAK ENDING .,"THE FIRST 400 PAGES WERE AWESOME PAGE TURNERS , THE NEXT 100 PAGES WERE USELESS PAGE FILLERS AND THE LAST 100 PAGES WERE A LETDOWN. I FELT MANIPULATED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE LAST 100 PAGES . HE LEAD THE READER ON A IMAGINATIVE JOURNEY ONLY TO FEED THEM THE ENDING WITH A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR . I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS, BUT MY DISSAPOINTMENT FORBIDS ME TO DO SO ."
2,Interesting at Times,"A pretty lengthy thriller that could use more thrills and more substantial characters. The plot elements are a bit worn and the preachy sections worth barely a skim. Be warned it has an anti-Catholic premise that might hurt some readers feelings and the author is pretty insensitive. If not taken seriously, an okay read. Biggest critism: writing, characters, and dialog. Best thing: It was interesting at times and had an odd humor to it."
2,Ignore the Fuss,"Our New York Public Library Reading Club recommends you skip this turkey until Thanksgiving when it will come out in paperback. If it is a bestseller, we regret contributing in anyway to its possible success because it is a waste of time for the intelligent reader. Our group only purchased it out of curiosity because it sounded interesting. Other readers should please not repeat _our_ mistake and save available book funds for novels far more worthy of attention.Fifth Ave. Branch Book Club Chair, Carl Wolwitz"
3,Much Ado,"This is not the worst thriller I've read, gee it's awful close. It just made no sense at all and it was so long. I finally finished it and wondered why? Discount this review as part of _that big conspiracy_ or save yourself some money. The last time I went to synagogue was 30 years ago!"
2,Depressing,"A darn depressing story. Nothing anyone ever believed, nothing we ever did was right. A female Jesus comes walking out of a cloneing lab, spouts new age nonsense, and the churches close?Am I missing something? Count me among the condemned. I would be happy to burn if it meant I'd never have to listen to another of little ""jezsa's"" inane speeches again!"
3,Odd in an Uninteresting Way,"A strange and unsatisfying novel, difficult to describe. I couldn't tell if the author was shooting for satire, thriller or what. He misses the target on everything and it ends up a big DUD. I wasn't offended, enlightened, or amused. Least of all, I wasn't moved. And I wouldn't recommend you blow 20 dollars on it. Paul Warner"
3,Disquieting & Cold,"I think what is disquieting here is that heart is missing. The characters were shallow and cold, seeming to try to fit a preset script without natural emotion. This cold, lifelessness was certainly evident in the Jeza character. Throughout the book she remained more an Israeli defense lab creation than a product of any divine design. Her attitudes reflect the trendy thinking of today rather than the true wisdom one might expect. While this book is deeply flawed, never achieving the author's obvious aspirations for it, ultimately it remains a fair thriller, lacking depth or meaning. Most disturbing is the complete absence of heart in the novel, leaving the reader cold and the story simply hollow."
1,Staggering,"I was mesmerized by what passes for dialogue, character development, and story telling technique in this novel. Not one character behaves in a plausible manner, especially the putative messiah. One gets the impression that the author knows nothing about theology or the bible. Even more disconcerting is how clueless he is about human nature. Much of the book details the author's personal grudge against religion and other more interesting aspects of the plot are ignored. The plot potential is staggering and the inability of the writer to effectuate it is disheartening. I'm afraid Kleier is just not up to the task he set for himself either intellectually or in writing faculty."
2,Offensive,"I have to agree with the reader from PA who said that as a woman she found the character of ""little Jeza"" offensive. Jeza could offend anyone! This character proves the author understands as little about women as he does about writing. Particularly outrageous is that the females in this book are more concerned with their boyfriends than the spiritual significance of the messiah's return. This ""but what about us?"" attitude made me sick. Only the male characters have thoughts about the spiritual implications and these are superficial. All the characters are shallow but the women are really vapid. They are symptomatic of the unenlightened novel this author has attempted."
4,Engaging Read!,"I couldn't put this book down. I found the exploration of the question, ""What would a higher being have to say about the state of the world today"" a fascinating one. Making it more compelling was that the story was told through the jaundiced eye of the media. As a woman, I was particularly moved by seeing world religions distilled through a female filter--finally! Readers will particularly like the ending which was both shocking and moving. I rarely recommend books--but I do endorse reading The Last Day."
5,A good point,"...The Last Day offers a plethora of beautful parables, maxims and aphorisms, not to mention some terrific action and nerve-racking suspense. All exceptionally well written. Here's one of a thousand examples I can cite--a taste of the real ""steak,"" (pg 228): ""A prominent D.C. defense attorney stepped up to Jeza with an attractive young thing on the arm of his expensive suit. 'Miss Jeza, I believe you and I have something rather significant in common. We're both in the same business--the business of saving people!' Jeza regarded him critcally for a moment and then bluntly replied, 'Yes, but my means of salvation do not render people penniless!"" This is a superb novel, and I rest my case!"
1,I 'm Afraid We Won't Ever Stop Hate,"I am tired of writers who have something ugly and hateful to say about religion of anyone. It is time to stop, to think, to rest. The world peoples cry out for peace and forgiveness, all here is old hates. Jews are stupid, they will follow blindly. Catholics will not listen to truth, no matter what. I hated this book because the author shows hatred for Jews and Christians. I feel very afraid, after all that has happened, that people buy this book and believe the lies again. Sonya Lieberman"
5,"Insightful food for thought, even for the non-religious.","This book is simply amazing. A no-nonsense look at what might REALLY happen, how people might REALLY react, should a new spiritual messenger appear. I am not a religious person, but I found so much food for thought in this book, I read it twice. One very appealing aspect, for me, was the even-handed treatment of men and women--as thinking, spiritual beings--by the new messiah. A book for the open-minded; and a book that might just open a few minds to some disturbing, yet intriguing and even inspiring possibilities."
2,Another point of view,"After reading the book and some of the other readers comments I confess I'm a little confused. While turning the pages my interest focused on the behaviour of the people and the roll of the mass media. One of the questions without answer that almost everybody wonders at least once in a lifetime is: What would happen if the messiah came back nowadays? And I have always thought it was a question about ourselves, about our society. I think that's an important viewpoint in the book, that's why all those pages about the Martins, and the roll of the WNN. About the book in general: sometimes the writting is too childish (that's not the exact word), the story predictable, and the author could have gone much furder."
5,"Love it or hate it, this book WILL make you think!","Philosophy, theology, politics, the media. All are involved in this top rate mystery/thriller. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I don't recommend that the reader take it as prophecy and I don't believe that it was intended as such. It is, however, an honest, no holds barred look at the world we live in, how we live in it, how we treat each other, and how we make everything so much more complicated than it has to be. I also think it shows that, however disillussioned one might be, there is still hope for us to learn."
4,Entertaining and thought provoking,Listened to the audio version (6 hours)while driving across a portion of the west. Found it reduced the boredom of the drive considerably and I spent an additional 15 minutes on reaching my destination just to finish it. The abridgement was very seamless. I selected it for the sci-fi aspects and yet I was more entertained by the religious topics. I strongly recommend the audio version.
1,The Last Novel I'd Ever Recommend,"I don't know what this book is supposed to be but it struck me as stupid New Age nonsense. Whoever wrote the thing really hates the Catholic church and many, many pages are spent bashing it. That got very old. Most of the characters are unlikeable and the story was dumb and predictable. It's awful long for a thriller where nothing really interesting happens but the writer had a lot of prejudice to vent and endless ravings about religion. Turns out to be a mindless rant that left me feeling sorry for the pope and sick of Little Jeza. Skip it."
2,Below Average,"As a thriller, this is below average, lacking in plot, suspense, and interesting characters. As literature, it's a joke. This is obviously the work of an amateur with some big ideas and little talent. There's a lot of overstated ideas that never get off the ground.A very odd book that was neither entertaining or worthwhile."
5,A must read,"To those readers who wrote reviews below to discourage me from reading this book, I just want you to know, you completely lost your credibility. This novel turned out to be one of the most interesting books I've ever read--everything you said it wasn't. The research that went into it is impressive, as is the writing. The very original storyline, the astonishing parables, the believable characters, (particularly the dark and enigmatic ""Jeza""), the way the tension builds to the breaking point, phenomenal! I have to question the motives of someone trying so hard to keep people away from this novel. It smells of censorship. I'm buying extra copies to give to all my friends, and I'll do what I can to help spread the word about this excellent book."
2,Overlong & Overblown,"If 200 pages were cut and a lot of the preaching left out, it would be an ok thriller. A good premise is, unfortunately, ruined by the author's ego and overwrought writing. Plot and charcters are equally thin and take a backseat to the writer's compulsion to ""enlighten"" the poor reader. His messiah, ""little Jeza"", is about as unlikeable and silly a savior one could imagine. Frankly, I was rooting for the pope! A real misfire as a thriller and as a satire. Heavy handed hokum and pretentious gunk."
1,Anythings Possible,"Clone escapes from lab on New Years 1999, is proclaimed messiah, and immediately raises hell in Vatican. Anythings possible... I guess. The only suspense in this thriller is just how much worse is the stupid book going to get. The novel is horribly written with abysmal characterizations. The silly New Age religion stuff doesn't help any, although the parables from the Newer New Testament are a hoot. I kept wondering if the author was actually serious. Sadly, I think he thought he was writing a deep and meaningful book, not a shallow piece of trash. I understand the author got a million smackers for this. For that much money I might consider reading the thing again and discovering a masterpiece this time!"
2,Extraordinary,"Are we as readers so spiritually bankrupt that thit feeble-minded and ineptly written novel might conceivably appeal to us somehow. I have had flyers handed to me in the tube that were better written and more thoughtfully presented than this ridiculous diatribe against Catholics. If the author could write worth a penny, I might have listened to him. But this drivel must be an embarrassment to the publisher. I understand a motion picture company bought this? Good lord."
1,This Is It,"Well, it's here. The worst thriller I have ever read. The religious issues and condemnation of organized religion I have no problem with. In fact, that was interesting for a while. But it went on and on. And I absolutely hated little Jeza! People here have discussed the awful writing better than I ever could. At first I thought that was done on purpose but nooo. And I ended up cheering for the Church. If only someone had the sense to shoot Jeza at the start I would have been spared 400 odd pages of the boring shrew's philosophy. When the inevitable finally happened and everybody was redeemed I felt like I had put myself through hell for nothing. Please, grant it's another 2000 years until Jeza returns (and until G. Kleier attempts to write another lousy book!)"
2,"""Comparison Shopping""","I agree with many of the thoughtful criticsms of this novel offered on this page. Certainly, the reader would do better to search Amazon for some of the far superior novels which address the same issues as Last Day, but with intelligence and fine writing. James Morrow, Daniel Easterman, James Halperin, and Stone's Damascus Gate, put Kleier's overwrought, flat effort to shame. I think superb, informed writing is more worth my time than a shallow novel driven by a concept jotted on a cocktail napkin. Manufactured thrillers like this are many, but readers will find something unique as well as rewarding in the alternate authors mentioned."
2,Warning,"I suggest readers check the bestseller lists and mainstream reviews for themselves because this is a third-rate thriller by an author who had an attack of self-importance while writing it. I thought the idea here is to express an opinion, not attack and discredit those who think this book is awful."
5,Truth triumphs,"Let me see if I got this straight: all but one of the top reviewers in the U.S. rave about this book; some of the world's top writers (including Clive Cussler and Larry Collins) call it one of the best books of the decade; Warner Books paid 1 million to publish it; Columbia TriStar paid another million to turn it into a movie; it's an international bestseller, published in 12 plus foreign countries and it's up for a number of awards. Now, on the other hand, we've got one obsessive/compulsive reader here who keeps writing in under assumed names and email address (confirmed by URL ECCO locator) who hates this book for personal religious reasons and can't abide the fact that other people like me love it. I think the jury is in on this one. THE LAST DAY is a fabulous novel, brilliantly written and powerful in its message. And that's the TRUTH!"
2,Trash is Trash,"The 10+ reviews speak of this book as it were a great work of literature. Does anyone read anymore?! This isn't even a good thriller. I enjoy an intelligent religious thriller (Daniel Easterman, James Halperin) but this pitiful effort is stupid, crude, stilted, and inane. Not even entertaining, simply trash. And to the paranoid here, I have no religious affiliation. This book just stinks."
2,Disturbing,"Others here have well described the poor quality of the writing and generally insipid content of this thriller. But I found it's ugly and hateful nature even more disturbing. This is a very dark novel, lacking the spark of hope found in even hardcore horror stories. The author expresses his distaste for faith and orthodox spirituality in a very offensive manner and presents a hopeless view of the faithful. I found his message superficial, his understanding shallow, and his arguments strange. Besides being a bad novel, I was left with a bad feeling. I don't remember reading any other book that was so silly yet troubling."
2,Reality Check - Please!,"If amazingly bad writing wasn't enough to kill a good story idea, the author of this book decided to create the character of Jeza and drive a stake through this novel's black little heart. Jeza, the female messiah, is a stereotypical feminist, an obnoxious twit who delivers parables for new age groupies and has the ability to bring to life for the reader the sensation of fingernails on a blackboard. Imagine 400 pages of that. I got halfway through this work of art, ignoring the poor writing as best I could, and finally tossed it aside during one of little Jeza's longer lectures on a bible she was obviously as unfamiliar with as the author of Last Day himself."
3,Aquinas It Is Not,"Though it's doubtful Kleier has heard of that particular Saint Thomas. No matter. What the author presents here is a simple satire of New Age nonsense (as represented in the annoying Jeza) and traditional teachings (the confused Church). Written with a broad pen, this novel never decides if it should be comedy or drama. It ultimately fails as both and is infantile and sophmoric. The discerning reader be aghast at Kleier's lack of knowledge and crude writing style."
3,OK Read,It's hard for me to get worked-up over is an ok thriller. I read a lot though. This was a little long and kind of idiotic. Also too preachy. But it was diverting if overpriced.
3,Over the Top,"I'm stunned by some of the over the top, ""book of the century"" type reviews here. And the assumption that only religious wackos would find this book less than a masterpiece of literature is pretty arrogant and ridiculous. Readers with taste still exist. I'm not a part of that bunch and think it's a pretty average thriller, nothing more. The only thing that offended me were the paper thin characters, outrageous dialogue, and the ongoing dime store philosophy lessons. If I could do it again, I would buy it in paperback. As to the fantastic reviews and incredible fawning over this book which is exhibited here, a grain of salt perhaps?...END"
3,Did I Miss Something?,"I'm wondering if something important about this book got by me. It seemed about average for this kind of thing with a little less smarts and excitement than most thrillers. It had some cardboard characters saying some awfully stupid stuff. But if this crazy book had an important point to make, what was it? Unless it was don't buy paperback junk until it comes out in paperback! If then."
2,Sit Down & Shut Up!,"It starts off as a good thriller, then it's like, I have something important to say so sit still and listen. I was offended by the writer's attitude, like I deserved his punishment for ever believing anything, than what he had to say. I just could not finish it. Long, boring lectures I have no problem finding."
5,Brilliant!,"This novel is totally unique, thrilling and fascinating. Chilling one moment, hillarious the next, but ALWAYS thought-provoking. Without question, one of the very best novels I've ever read. I give this the highest recommendation."
4,Keeps you reading,"Not what I expected. This is more of a mystery novel than a theological treatise. The book does get into some hot topics and handles them well. I particularly liked the encounters between Jeza and the Vatican, which were intense and had a ring of truth to them. The best character in the book for me was the pope, who I thought was sincere in his tragic confusion. This a hard book to put down."
2,Fair,"This is an okay thriller, but it isn't great. The characters are flat and lifeless, the writing pretty mediocre. The plot had some cute twists, but the lecturing was tedious. Jeza, the cloned messiah, was too much to take, as was the Vatican cabal of stereotypical evil cardinals. I guess disliking this novel reveals me as an agent of the religious right, but I actually just enjoy reading.I don't mean to offend fans of the book. I simply thought it was a below average thriller that was tough to get through."
4,The calendar is superfluous,"After having read the reviews and consequently the book, I have come to the conclusion that the arguements regarding the accuracy of the gregorian calander is a mute point. The fact is that Kleier has written a great book. Is it fiction? Yes. Nobody has made a claim to the different. Anytime we blend the current and extrapolated technology of today with Biblical revelations we will have dissagreements as regards timing. The fact is, nobody knows. I was highly entertained by this novel, as I am with any well researched and vividly written work. I would recommend Kleier's work to anybody interested in this genre. For a more reality-worldly based view into the next decade, I would also highly recommend ""Transfer:the end of the beginning"" by Jerry Furland. We are running out of time to split hairs. Read, learn, enjoy."
5,my head is spinning!,"Talk about an amazing book! It's like a magnet, you put it down and it keeps tugging at you till you get back to it. Even after I finished it, I couldn't get enough. I hated to see it end. Jon, Jeza, Litti, Hunter, I loved them--they are like real live people to me, and I miss them. I pray for a sequel, and soon. Until then, I'll just have to read it again. Please Mr. Kleir, a sequel!"
2,Pretty Dumb,"I didn't find this to be a novel of great ideas, as some have. In fact, the ideas, plot, and writing were of the same quality - weak. It was all very politically correct and the author picked a popular strawman for a target of abuse: the Church. Some of the criticism was dead-on. Some was off-base and ugly. I can't say I enjoyed the book much, but I'm not really into trashing other folks' faith. And there is prejudice here, plenty. It's been done before, much better, and this is not exactly the caliber of author to break new ground-LOL!"
5,Very unusual book,"Any book that can stir up nearly 600 reader-reviews--from die-hard fans and foaming-at-the-mouth detractors, alike--is something I had to investigate for myself. Verdict: THE LAST DAY is a cultural event. There's more reality in one page of this brilliant ""fiction"" than there is in volumes of most so-called ""non-fiction"" written on this subject. The author strips religious hypocrites and hypesters buck naked before the whole world. And is it a delight to watch! A terrific, rewarding read!"
2,What a missed opportunity!,"A great idea that deserved a talented author! The opportunity was completely missed to say something profound about the hypocrisy of the Church and Christianity's failure. Instead, we get a rehash of old bigoted attitudes, feminist stereotypes, and a cartoonish thriller. I would give this five stars for inspiration and zero stars for the clumsy, hatchet-job attempt at writing. It could easily have been half its lumbering length and been half as bad. The author must hire a ghost writer if he has another good idea, or an editor with better sense and judgment."
2,"Insufferably Pretentious, but...","While I found Last Day strictly the work of an untalented amateur and glaringly pretentious, one must give the writer credit for addressing some of the excesses of the church. Whether discriminating readers are willing to wade through 600+ pages of terrible writing to arrive at all too obvious conclusions is doubtful. Such a windy, fitfully told story hardly does justice to the injustices of the church. Here, the issues are trivialized as semi-comic plot devices to advance a series of soap opera episodes involving many uninvolving characters. Readers may wince at this cliche ridden novel's crudeness, but it's badly written meanness permeates and obscures legitimate concerns. This subject deserves the attention of a gifted author instead of this third-rate thriller-with-a-message misfire."
2,Okay,"Pretty fair sci-fi type stuff, way too long, and very, very long. The writing is definitely a minus and I got a little tired of the church bashing. Jeza, the clone that somehow is the supposed messiah(?!) was a major mistake and a nincompoop! Definitely not an earthshaking, life-changing reading experience nor a great contribution to literature."
2,Pompous & Banal,"This isn't just a thriller! This book has important things to say?? Should anyone need help understanding the difference between reasoned, thoughtful criticism of organized faith and dull-witted prejudice, or for that matter, between tedious pseudo-philosophizing and real thought, this very long novel is here to clear the air. As pretentious as it is hateful and misguided, this fiercely anti-Catholic novel makes one wonder just which of the author's knuckles Sister Mary may have finally broken in frustration at his lack of writing talent. For those of us who left the Church, just get over it Kleier! Don't inflict unresolved bigotry on readers. Readers are supposed to believe that what makes this book worth enduring are its windy metaphysical meanderings, but these thoughts are so pompous and banal that they can't begin to redeem what is a very bad novel, full of bogus posturing and empty of thought."
1,Simply Awful,"This is the worst writing I've read in years. A ridiculous plot, lifeless characters (especially that loony bombast messiah, Jeza!), and a hateful arrogance for anything but New Agey silliness. I hope the producer who bought this freaky fable was fired and the money refunded because it looks like the studio heard this one gobbling long before Thanksgiving. Maybe the movie version would have been better than this book - it would've been shorter, it would've actually moved, and it certainly couldn't be much worse than this trash."
5,Worthy of a re-read,I just finished this great novel and I'm going to read it again to see what all I missed the 1st time. It is chock full of amazeing little anecdotes and interesting tidbits that are easy to overlook. I actualy wentback after page 450 and read a couple of chaptrs again to give me a clearer picture about what was happening (I jumped to some incorrect conclusions). It's a really fun book all the way thru and left me in awe of the way everything came to such a tight ending after all the madness and chaos. The story keeps you on your toes and on the edge of your seat at the same time.
2,not grounded enough in fact to make it believable,would only impress someone without a working knowledge of theology...
1,"""Bombast and Bad Taste""","The above quote is from the Publisher's Weekly review. After reading this for myself, I've got to agree. The enthusiastic reviews here are certainly consistent: they all share the author's prejudice against Catholics. I'm not Catholic, but the bigotry displayed here and in the novel is unsettling. The amazon sales rating for this unpleasant screed at least is evidence that the vast majority of readers have good taste. Nice to see crudely written hate mongering doesn't go over well. As to the thought police nonsense, let paranoia and bigotry speak for themselves."
3,Ok Thriller stuff,"Too farout and not much fun to read, this is an ok thriller if you have time to kill. I'm sorry I wasted time on it but the premise is fascinating even though the book is not."
5,"Intricate Plot, Message of Substance","Thought I'd give this book a try after reading the reviews both glowing and nasty. Frankly, I thought I'd land in the middle of the road and find this book neither fabulous nor flop. Boy, was I wrong. This author writes eloquently and with great pacing. He's a master of plot interweaving layer upon layer, tying the threads in a compelling, surprise ending. The characters and message are haunting me still. Seems to me that this is a book for our time."
2,Overlong & Overwrought,"The basic story idea is interesting but the author's talent is just not equal to the challenge. What begins as a poorly penned thriller quickly becomes a very lengthy and overheated indictment of the Church. While the anti-Catholic message may appeal to those readers with such prejudiced inclinations, others are likely to become bored with the tedious ravings of the messiah, Jeza. The potential of this character is lost as she reveals her self simply a contrived stooge who endlessly preaches the author's simple-minded bias against Roman Catholics."
2,Good Lord...,"At the risk of being burned at the stake as a ""henchman for the religious right"", allow me a voice in the wilderness here. When I finished this telephone directory of a thriller last night, I came here to comment on how much I disliked it. From some of the reviews, I thought I had the wrong book. To be accurate, unless I bought a misprinted copy of the book, the Last Day I read was written poorly, self-important nonsense, with a politically correct Jeza character (a female Jesus clone) who gave me the creeps when she wasn't making me yawn. The church bashing was funny at times, but seemed overdone and bitter when it went on too long. The author doesn't appear to know much about the bible, religion, or real people. If it wasn't so darn long, so difficult to read, and so self-important, it could be dismissed as a sub-par thriller. But since the book tries so desperately to be significant, I'll give it two stars for the effort. I believe I smell smoke, so on to better books!"
3,"A riveting book, at times.","This is fascinating reading. A huge ""what if"" scenario that still has time to come true. My only negative is the continuing attacks on organized religion and especially the Catholic Church throughout the book. Other than that the story is almost credible and quite realistic. Worthwhile reading. Would make one heck of a movie."
2,Okay Thriller,"Dated now but still an okay thriller centering around the Milennium craze and the the Second Coming. Jesus returns as Jeza (a New Age Feminist!)and the rest of the plot is incidental and pretty darn familiar to readers of this kind of thing. I enjoyed some of this but it is overlong and preachy. The characters (especially the villains) are silly and their actions incredible. Jeza, however, is a hoot! You have to read some of her parables because they are priceless as Politically Correct versions of creaky old bible favorites. This is actually on sale for 1 cent through Amazon.com so what have you got to lose except hours of your life?"
2,Old Bigotry in New Format,"Some of the enthusiastic reviews here are perplexing and must come from the publisher. Even truly great literature doesn't receive such raves. For an ordinary thriller, this novel has surprisingly touched upon and for a moment legitimized anti-Catholic bigotry for the narrow minded. The delight taken in this by certain readers is disturbing. In every other way the book is unexceptional, but the underlying prejudice, hatred, and venom towards the Church is unique. One would think people might be more tolerant and enlightened, yet this kind of thing is still embraced by some. This novel will encourage those that hold on to old hates and offend the intelligent reader."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Kleier","I don't know if authors ever visit these pages, but if you do, Mr. Kleier, my personal thanks to you for a truly inspiring and uplifting novel. This is masterpiece of creativity, the way it intertwines so many different theologies and philosophies into such a complex, yet such a clear vision. Beautiful prose (I especially love the parables and the messiah's speeches). Haunting. This is a book that stays with you long after you've finished it. Again, thank you!"
2,New Age Preaching and it goes On and On and On...,"I had a difficult time dealing with the New Age tone of this book and found the characters obnoxious, boring, juvenile. It seemed at times the author was preaching for hundreds of pages and it was pretty airheaded stuff. The character of Jeza was simply irritating and simplistic. But that pretty much summarizes this author's efforts. As I was reading, all I could think was that this was a wonderful idea that unfortunately fell into the hands of an inept first-time writer. What a mess!"
2,A Waste of Time & Money,"About the most lame-brained thriller in years. The characterizations and dialogue are below the comic book level. In fact, the writing overall is as elementary as it gets. Bombast and overlength don't hold any interest for me and the only part of the book that works is borrowed from other, much better novels. The story is as ludicrous as the fact that this thing was ever actually published. A total waste as a novel, but some accurate criticism of the Church."
2,"Fascinating Premise, but...","This novel has a fascinating premise that could have made for a brilliant story if written by a more gifted author. Instead, the story meanders for eternity as uninteresting, stick-figure characters make stupid comments and become inexplicably messmerized by a uncharismatic, spooky female saviour who acts more like a witch. I haven't read a bible since grade school and I still couldn't match some of the basic ignorance on display in these many pages. The bad guys are the usual cast: evil cardinals, mad scientists, and religious fanatics. This is an original idea wasted by really bad writing and a ridiculous plot. It might have been a great thriller if the author were less enamored with writing something really long and wasn't such a windbag."
1,politically correct messiah ?,"The action was jerky, the plot thin. The theology was unscriptural. There are THREE persons in the trinity - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - not four. There is no daughter. If you want to read this, remember that it is fiction, and poor fiction at that."
2,Unresolved Issues,"What must have been a cathartic experience for the author, resolving childhood issues with Catholic parents, amounts to an unpleasant hatchet job on the Church and unenlightening diatribes. With a thriller, I want to be entertained and maybe learn something, not be endlessly lectured. Klier writes with the subtlety of a battering ram and his Jeza character is a simpleminded mouthpiece for his anti-Catholic prejudices. If it isn't clear, I didn't care for this book!"
3,Letdown,"After reading some of these reviews, I was prepared for a great read. But after Halperin's First Immortal, what a letdown! The author lacks style, wit, and intelligence. The politically correct, new age philosophy is laughable and the writing stiff, lifeless muck. The interminable sermons from the guru/savior get tired fast and I ended up bored. Skipped to the end finally. No surprizes there."
3,Hey- it's just a thriller!,"This is pretty good for a thriller. Insight, profundity, or great writing-please! But for what it is it's not without merit.I thought parts were good, although it was 200 pages toooo loooog."
3,Not that Bad,"The writing is primitive but its not that bad for what it is. I had to admire how the writer steamrolled through his material while making it apparent his ignorance of the subject matter. More attention could have been given the characters and there is no reason other than ego that it had to be over four hundred pages long. It all gets kind of repeatitive and seems padded. Still, I thought the way the media was shown and the churches were humiliated was good. Not exciting but made me think about things."
2,Not Even Good Airplane Reading,"I don't really care about the religious overtones in this book as other readers did. I just thought it was bad. I found this book to be extremely poorly written. The dialogue was phony, the situations were contrived and there was absolutely no character development. It's easy to tell that the author is a Marketing professional. This book was all sizzle and no steak. A novel as a Jinggle writer would write it. Not even good airplane reading."
3,Interesting Story,"A good story, but I agree you have to be willing to overlook some putrid writing. Kind of a ""Weekly World News"" plot with silly characters. However, an interesting thriller at times. I enjoyed James Halperin's new book much, much more and it's a literary gem in comparison though."
1,Amazing,"It amazing to me as an editor at a New York house that stuff like this ever gets published. The concept is excellent, but the author lacks the basic ability to tell a story. I doubt the best editor could have salvaged the kind of writing on exhibit here, but at nearly 500 pages, there is no evience anyone even tried. If a million was paid for screen rights, the author won the lottery."
5,Read this and weap!,"For all the moralists out there who are repeatedly crabbing to this page under false pretenses, you're too late. The Last Day is already a bestseller here and abroad, and growing. You can't stop truth from spreading, and when it's blended into a nerve-wrenching and thought challenging thriller like this, you can't forget it either. Long live Jeza!"
5,the best book I've read in 1998!!!,"I truly enjoyed that book and recommended it to my family and all of my friends. It does'nt matter if you believe in God or not, this book makes you think and consider - it's really the best of all books I've read in 1998 - and I read a lot! Don't miss it - and if you've enjoyed it - order ""The Genesis Code"" by John Case - it's also a very good book!"
2,Millenial Dud,"Of all the millenial thrillers I've read so far, this is surely the worst. Very, very dull reading. The author seems to have a sense of self-importance that has given him the mistaken notion that his ideas would be pretty dog-gone interesting. Well, too much opininating wears me out. It appears that little research was done before the word processor was fired-up with this book. Nor was a creative writing class attended. Raw talent is great in a first novel if well done. This is just raw. Maybe payment was by the word because if it were half as long it might be easier to bear. When a writer tackles science fiction, philosophy, religion, the bible, Modern Israel, and the meaning of life, a little knowledge would be handy, not to mention the talent required to write intelligently about the subjects. In this swirling river of ideas, you can see the writer's beanie bobing on a swell. Life preservers for author and reader, please!"
3,Can't Help But To Make You Think,"I didn't quite know what to expect. And as I read on, I found the author to have a vast knowledge of religious views, many of which I've considered myself, and had thought perhaps I was somewhat unique in thinking that way. The book kept me engrossed from beginning to end, not knowing how it was to turn out. You can't second guess this book. It will open your eyes. It will rekindle memories of your past experiences in church. And it can't help but to stimulate your desire to get closer to GOD once again."
2,Tiresome Tirade,"This was a downright miserable read. The author's heavyhanded diatribes, new age silliness, and simple minded theology really left me ill. Poor characterizations, lame plotting, and clunky writing help to make this dumb thriller especially tedious, irritating, and 350 pages more than I could stand."
3,Fair Thriller,"Fairly well done, with some ok plot twists. Way off the mark as far as religion, the church, and bible history goes. Still, it held my attention, although the messiah was a ludicrous loony a hungry puppy wouldn't follow."
3,Disappoining,"I was very disappointed in this story. The plot is just too far fetched and the biblical basis for it is nonexistent. The messiah, some kind of messed up medical experiment, doesn't have any appeal at all. I can see how religious folks could be offended, but the only thing that offended me was throwing money away on this. For great religious iconoclasm, read James Morrow. Now, he is worth one's time and money."
3,"Hollywood, here we come","Ah yes, the boogie man arrives on the wings of angels. Must admit that this is well done, and the author certainly heats up the Catholic Church. If the list of forbidden books was still around, this would definitely make it. Entertaining, but I had the feeling of MOVIE throughout. Don't expect spiritual guidance."
2,Broken Promise,"At first this debut thriller showed promise. Unfortunately, that promise isn't sustained as it reveals itself as a quite mediocre novel whose easy swipes at Catholicism deteriorate into boilerplate, sophmoric moralizing of the most smug kind. The author's self-indulgence is limitless as he berates one with his personal prejudices concerning the imagined evils of the Vatican. The book founders on its one-dimensional treatment of important issues, ones that seem beyond the intellectual scope of the writer. What might have been a fairly good story ends as an excuse for airing the rather vicious views of a religious bigot."
2,Gospel According to Beavis and Butthead,"Kind of a groovy, now kind of happening as Christ appears as a politically correct feminist who seems unfamiliar with the original Gospels. This time it's a way cool media event and Jeza (oh boy) is the pop icon that can save our souls with a little help from her friends, the Magog. Too much! Far out!"
2,Jeza has Returned and She's Not Very Pleased,"Fundamentalist readers won't be happy with this attack on their beliefs and other readers may be just plain bored. The tirades about religion go on and on and on. No one could possibly buy the plot and paper thin characters. As someone who hasn't set foot in a church since Sunday school, even I found the bible references and Jeza's Newer New Testament off base and a real hoot. However, I really don't see such an inconsequential fantasy as being controversial or offensive."
2,Salvation Smarmy,"This is more of an anti-religious rant than novel. Redemption here is presented as a selfrighteous and hateful, lacking any sense of spirituality. I'm not Catholic, but I didn't particularly enjoy seeing a saintly pope humiliated by a David Copperfield/Koresh clone. I guess as the 20th century ends second rate writers will churn out millenial novels in abundance and they shall come upon us as the plagues in Revelations. Woe unto us!"
2,Darn Boring,"Well, it's got a dumb plot, horrible writing, silly characters, and is so darn boring that I almost didn't finish it. That's about all, except this writer should do a little research and not limit himself to Cliff Notes next time. A creative writing class might help."
2,Fair but Unfair,"This was a fair novel for what it is, but the anti-catholic elements were biased by ignorance and 1890's prejudice. As a former Catholic, I found that part of the book needless and uncalled for. The concept of a female messiah had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, the author comes up with an unbiblical bozo in Jeza, as well as a female stereotype.Parts of the story were fun, but I found the author's attitude too negative to really enjoy. This writer may consider himself a humanitarian, yet it is as well-disguised here as his reputed talent. At least 200 pages of the book are devoted to his unresolved bitterness toward the church, and that wore me down. Many of us are displeased with the church - Thankfully, all don't write boring diatribes and stick them as silly sermons in overwrought thrillers."
2,Dreary,"An awful dreary, long, wordy book that depressed me when I wasn't dozing off. The author pushes a real anti-Catholic agenda that seemed creepy and unfair. I'm not into political correctness, nor am I Catholic, but whoever wrote this is a bigot, and I wouldn't recommend it for that reason alone. The story is standard millenial stuff, only not done well. Some of the writing was so bad it was distracting and none of the people in the story were credible. At times the plot made no sense at all and the messiah (she) made my skin crawl. Maybe the author would become a follower of this clueless boob, but I doubt any crowds would gather for her. I've heard there was a tv movie going to be made, but I guess the producers finally read the book. Proof that you can't judge a book by the blurb on the cover. Mystery Science Theatre could have had a fiesta with this one!"
1,Unsophisticated Primitiveness (the Bad kind),"With heady premise in hand, this author bulls into his story with the prose style of a Madison Avenue ad man. Subtlety is not his forte. An editor's blue pencil was badly needed when this monumental manuscript was presented - the writing is primitive much too often. Even in this genre, the plot is farcical (which would be fine if the author were not so deadly serious). Too many of the ingredients in this turgid potboiler have been lifted from other novels where they worked well. The effect is jarring and results in deja vu predictability. Stronger characters, people who are more than mere mouth pieces for delivery of speeches and sermons, were sorely needed. The book wallows in self-righteous unctuousness that leaves one praying not to be trapped next to this author on a long plane flight."
1,Thrillerless,"An amateur thriller that is almost endless and seems ultimately pointless. The only thing this book challenges is the reader's endurance when confronted with a mediocre epic and an author with delusions that he has something important to say. The story, suspense, and plot unravel over the course of 600 pages of intellectual desolation. Definitely skip this one."
2,"OK, but that's it.","Some of these reviews are mystifying when this is a pretty dumb thriller and hardly deep. As mentioned many times, the writing is plain bad. Silly characters and outlandish dialog galore. And the Catholic bashing gets old fast. I agree it's too preachy and the sermons gave me the itch to skip pages (I did, often). I sure wouldn't recommend this as some kind of great book! Very poorly done and way too long."
5,Wonderful story,"Anyone who's ever had to sit through a sanctimonious Sunday sermon will find this novel immensely satisfying. Here, the tables are finally turned and a messenger from God gives the holier-than-thou's their comeuppance. It's done with great finesse and wit, and is humorous at times but also quite frightening. The story is so credible, you will find yourself responding as if it really is happening. A very entertaining and enjoyable novel."
3,Interesting but too preachy,"Based on the previous Amazon.com reviews of this book I was a little disappointed. It reads more like a sci-fi movie than a story based on the end times. To be fair, the book is a real page-turner with some interesting surprises, hence, the 3 stars. What disappointed me was its ignorance and/or misinterpretation of Biblical prophecy. For example, the book's Brotherhood of Man philosophy gets old rather quickly. If you're looking for a clue as to what to expect in the Last Days this book is not for you.For a Biblically-based perspective on the end times check out the ""Nicholae"" book series by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye or even Frank Peretti's new book, ""The Visitation""."
2,Disappointing,"A very odd thriller that doesn't really hit the mark. The author's Clive Cussler-like style lacks the magic of that popular writer and is uniquely nasty and mean. It was impossible to believe in the characters, particularly the women, or the way the story developed. Nothing seemed to ring true and the reader isn't drawn-in to the story. An author familiar with or who had researched Israel would capture much more the dynamism of the people. It definitely should have been shorter as the conclusion's disappointment is even greater due to such a lengthy build-up. Just too much of an investment of time for what it is: an unpleasant, unsatisfying, hyprid thriller."
2,Offended Agnostic,"This was loaned to me by my inlaws, card carrying members of the 700 Club. They liked it! I expected to hate it. It turns out I just was disgusted by it. As an agnostic, I didn't give the so-called religious message much thought. But as Publishler's Weekly said in its review, this novel has such overwrought dialogue and poor writing that it's distracting. So is the deafening sound of all those axes grinding away. At least offer the reader a somewhat sympathetic central character. So this is one agnostic who is offended - by really bad writing."
3,Secrets Revealed???,"I preferred The First Immortal to this book. For some reason this author has it in for the Catholics and spends most of his time bashing them. The big secret he reveals is the Vatican Bank scandal, news to those who missed the headlines some years ago and didn't see the last Godfather film. The messiah hates Catholics in this novel so much that she sets the ecumenical cause back 1000 years. Let's hope the actual messiah will be more tolerant and appreciate the well-meaning faith of millions, as fragile and misguided as it is at times. And be less apt to break things!"
2,Less than Expected,"Not much to this and what there is is much less than one might expect. A terrific premise wears thin after 400 pages and one is left asking ""what is the point?"" Maybe my expectations were too high, but this novel is just second-rate horror/thriller stuff that fails miserably as entertainment or mainstream fiction. Wait for the tv movie it seems to be a rough draft for. Maybe a skilled screenwriter can do something with it if the original author isn't involved."
2,Unimpressive Debut,"An unimpressive debut by this author who shows he knows little about how to make a thriller interesting. Turgid prose and outlandish characters are part of the problem, but the agenda, however one interprets it, was dull and oppressive. Don't Preach! I get enough dry lectures in grad school, thanks. The rebellious clone has been done to death by now, as has the nonconformist messiah. But since this is a first effort and it must have taken forever to type this dinosaur manuscript, 2 stars."
1,Pompous Overkill,"A pompous, slow-moving, supernatural melodrama with a little comic relief from the new age messiah, Jeza. Incredibly verbose and pointless, pathetically written, and cornball. What little action in it grinds to a halt when Jeza gives one of her frequent stump speeches for the Equal Rights Amendment. Seems to glory in giving Catholics a gratuitous bloody nose as much as it loves to punish a reader with endless, convoluted prose. Honestly, only if you're desperate."
5,The most rivetting book I've ever read,"As exciting, intelligent, thrilling and supsenseful a novel as I've ever read. Perhaps the best book I've ever read! I'm not exaggerating. The story is terrific, stimulating, thought provoking, absolutely fascinating. I can't say enough about it. I kept thinking to myself all the way through, --there's no way the payoff can live up to the build-up--but this time, it does. I can't get this novel out of my mind. I am buying copies as Christmas gifts for all my friends and family."
5,A message that deserves to be heard!,"I can't say enough about this book. I loved it! It's unlike anthing I've ever read. A fascinating mystery that is seductive, frightening, amusing, surprising, and even educational. It's also addictive. Once you begin it, you simply can't put it down. Great entertainment!"
2,Outline for the TV show,"Reads more like a rough outline for the tv show it's destined to be than novel. One can imagine this ""concept"" being pitched at a studio. Once the idea was sold, a novelization is patched together for ""prestige"", and the publicity boys start cranking up the buzz (cooked-up controversy is good). I think the boat was missed here because the no-talent hack hired to manufacture this literary mess wrote an overblown, long, boring tome that lacks imagination and excitement. Wait for the tv show- it will be free and you can do ironing while it's on. Much more intellectual stimulation and less of a waste of time."
3,Hilarious Fun but...,"I really found it to be hilarious at times and its humor is its strong point. However, when things get serious the book comes to a grinding halt. Too often the author gets carried away with his personal crusades and neglects to tell a story. The lectures begin to drag and about 200 pages in the middle were interminable. When little Jeza, charmless as she is, lectures the pope and breaks St. Peter's altar, the book almost lost me. Still, it does have some funny moments and provoking ideas."
2,Great Movie Idea,"In the hands of a professional screenwriter, the premise of this novel could be beautifully realized. Just keep the original author out of the creative process. The book is poorly written and aspects of the plot are silly. The basic idea has wonderful potential if the Jeza character is improved and made less of a freak. I'm interested in seeing the final result after a good writer salvages an excellent concept from this fiasco of a novel."
4,"Trash, but not bad","I usually don't enjoy trash, but this isn't bad. Bad dialogue, a ridiculous messiah, and idiotic biblical references aside, the idea of Christ returning as a feminist and taking on the Vatican certainly held my attention. Overlong, but amusing."
3,about average really,"Readers might wish to read the more thoughtful reviews further down this page before spending hardcover money on an average paperback thriller. Claims of this being ""important"" literature are just ludicrous and seem part of a crazy sales effort. Anyone interested in a truly fine novel concerning the millenium and an intelligently realistic portrayal of millenarian events in Israel should read DAMASCUS GATE. Absolutely stunning writing and superb characterizations. Skip this drivel."
5,Dynamite!,"Oh boy is this book gooing to set off a few firestorms in the sanctums of organized religion. Fabulous job. Keenly plotted, wittily executed. I went through the whole spectrum of emotions here. Anger, fear, sorrow, laughter, surprise. Much surprise. No book in years has captured my imagination so well and kept me so off balance the entire story (not easy to do in a book of 500 pages). Not a wasted word or misplaced metaphor. The parables are uncanny and devastatingly honest. A fantastic experience. How about a sequel!"
5,Very Hot!,"I loved this book from the first page. The author has taken some of themost controversial and provocative issues of our time and wrapped them in a story of incredible suspsense and terror. You may not like the man's theology, which is caustically irreverent at times, but you can't deny the compelling, effective way he treats his subject matter. The messiah figure is terrific--hauntingly human, yet enigmatic, awesome and divine, at the same time. The story is impossible to second guess. Couldn't put this one down and sorry to see it end. Sequel, please!"
2,What could have been a great book flops!,"I thought this would be a great book, a great topic was chosen by the author, but the development of the plot was way too slow and time consuming. I normally can read a book such as this in depth, but I ended up skimming many of the chapters to get to the meat of the book. When the author chose to, he was very good. This was not the page turner I would have expected (other than turning the pages to get to something that mattered!"
1,"Disappointing, thinly-veiled Catholic-bashing","What a waste of a great idea! A half-hour into this contrived, woodenly-written drek, I was wishing that the author had simply executed on what is still a really intriguing concept: A turn-of-the-millenium thriller. Instead, I found myself wading through unimaginative dialogue, characters that by comparison make the Rugrats seem emotionally involving, and cheap shots at every organized religion.Put this concept in the skilled hands of an author who hasn't got a vendetta against Catholics-- or at least can hide it more creatively-- and they'll be lining up at Amazon.com's website."
1,Less Here than Some Reviews,"I consider myself an agnostic but I don't share the sheer delight some reviewers (and this author) takes in demeaning the faith of others. Especially disturbing is the way in which these beliefs are treated with such cavalier ignorance. Catholics, which is the only group the author may have a slight knowledge of (and have unresolved issues with from grade school) are treated in the most disturbing manner. This novel is amazingly misinformed, POORLY WRITTEN (other reviews dismiss that) and has so many axes grinding it ends up a personal tirade by the author."
1,Mindless,"I enjoy a well-written thriller with good characters, realistic dialog, and an intelligent plot: everything this mindless drivel is not. More an anti-religious rant than novel (with a particular hatred for the Roman Catholics), this book is 250 pages too long. I appreciate writing that challenges my thinking and values. Unfortunately, this author simply spews interminable amounts of venomous prejudice and insults the intelligence of thoughtful readers. One that I sincerely wish I had missed."
5,Stunning!,"Wow is this author is going to hear from the Religious Right! The novel lays out in very gripping, compelling fashion the hypocrisy and arrogance, self-righteousness and materialism that is rampant in many religious organizations today. Because it is so open and honest, and told with such power and conviction, you find it hard sometimes to believe it's fiction. Highly suspenseful and often terrifying, the story is surprisingly upbeat in the end, with some really astounding twists I never anticipated. No doubt, this will prove to be a controversial novel, but it's a controversy that is long overdue and badly in need of the exposure this worthy novel gives it. A terrific tale, well told!"
2,Interesting at times,"Fairly good thriller that is too often self-indulgent to author's prejudices and just plain cruel at times. The characters are weak and that can sink the best story for me. After slogging through this overlong opus, you may feel that you put more effort into reading this than the author did writing it. There's certainly deeper thought in some of these reviews than any place in this novel. But as a thriller, I give it a pass."
5,Excellent novel,"I was delighted to have this novel recommended to me by a friend. She told me it was spectacular, and she was quite right. This story may be hard for some people to deal with because it upsets a number of religious applecarts. Nevertheless, that's what helps create the fierce tension in the novel, and people should keep that in mind. It's only fiction, even if it reads like it's not."
2,Long-winded Dud,"Very long and very dull. Amateurish writing that sets your teeth on edge and flat, lifeless characters. The sermons and ravings of the Jeza figure are uniquely bizare and stupid. An uninspired and gargantuan dud of a thriller that lectures rather than tells an interesting story. Please, no sequel until Y3K!"
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I really didn't care for this book. None of the characters are likeable, especially Jeza the messiah who is shrill, nasty, and boring. The action was identical to a hundred other thrillers I've read and nothing much was new. Somehow, I don't think the Second Coming will be this much of a soap opera. It just is superficial and silly. I felt very let down by this author."
2,Silly and Time Consuming,"While I enjoyed some of the bashing of the Roman church, I found the plot pretty ridiculous and the characters unaffecting and stock. I agree the writing is amateurish and that this is third-rate science fiction, but the attempt at social commentary is commendable even if ham-handed. This has all been done before and much, much better in much, much shorter novels. Unforunately, this takes a while to wade through for a predictable climax. Definitely not for discerning tastes or religious right folks.Or me."
5,Fascinating thriller,"If you're looking for something to get your heart pumping this holiday season, here's the book for you. I read this over the weekend and did little else. Couldn't put it down. I can't remember when I've read anything that's electrified me so. Fast moving and chock full of intriguing thoughts and provocative situations. With some books, you're lucky if it builds to a strong, final resolution. With this book, there are literally dozens of nerve-wracking moments, and the climax (don't worry, I won't reveal it) is a real stunner. The creativity of the story and the very unsual, effective way it's written is amazing in itself. I strongly recommend this. Totally unlike anything I've ever read before."
2,Second Rate Iconoclast,"This is pretty pale stuff when compared to James Morrow's brilliant Towing Jehovah or Bible Stories for Adults, two iconoclastic masterpieces. The author of Last Day bludgeons the reader with a elementary interpretation of the bible and open disgust for the ""sacred"". Morrow confronts organized religion with wit and intelligence, qualities absent in this novel. Where Morrow offers insight into Religious beliefs, this author offers very little. Morrow is a genious at exposing hypocrisy with wit, subtlety, and sheer guts, cutting to the sanctimonious bone. This author delivers a few bruises, but lacks the heart and soul of the great iconoclast. This is a loooong sermon against the church, without the style and talent for stepping on clay feet which Morrow demonstrates consistently. It's the difference between a skilled surgeon and an apprentice butcher."
3,Millenial Thriller,"Looks like the millenium is going to be where the action is for thriller writers. While this ones okay, I hope some of the more talented genre writers can do better. This one really doesn't go anywhere, moves slowly to a ponderous conclusion, and has a dumb plot. Misses the bull's eye, but not a bad shot."
5,People are taking this book too personally,"Ladies and gentlemen, this book is FICTION! It's not real! Too many readers are letting their emotions run away with them here, and perhaps that's an indication of how well this book is written. Read it for what it is, an engrossing story, poignant characters and a very ingenious plotline. It's not meant to be theology, it's high caliber entertainment. Lighten up!"
2,14,"I didn't care for this novel at all. It isn't a very good thriller or mystery and it's an absolutely terrible and ridiculous end times story. Some reviewers seem to think this book has something to say, but it all seems a little hyper to me. I don't think this author has much to teach readers and he fails to entertain as well. Wish I could say this is a fine first effort for this writer, but that simply isn't the case. He seems to have bitten off much more than he can chew and nearly choked. I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,"Impossible to put down, a little simplistic","I read a lot of mass market thrillers, and this is a very good one. I am a sucker for a good story, and I found myself having to force myself to put it down in order to go to work, or get some sleep. So if you are looking for a good entertaining read, you will not be disappointed.However, the characters are all a bit one dimensional, and the dialogue isn't exactly Oscar Wilde. That's not really relevant - have you ever tried to write dialogue? It's not easy. The main fault with the book is the baddies, especially the ones from organised religion. I was yearning for Malachi Martin, and his subtle observations of Vatican politics. But this is a fault that only stops the book from being great, and doesn't stop it being very good."
1,New Age pseudo-religious blathering,"I must admit I was captivated by the storyline throughout most of the novel. I cannot say the same for the ideas proposed theirein however. The ""messiah"" is a thinly disguised postergirl for all of the NewAge-ism that many American sadly mistake for spirituality. The author is against organized religion and flagrantly anti-Catholic, and shows considerable ignorance toward Roman Catholicism, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Chasidic Judaism, and possibly a few other ""hypocritical"" religions that I might've forgotten to mention. Enjoy this book for the story, but if you want any real religious insight try Henri Nouwen or Thich Nhat Hanh."
3,This is the book I wanted to write ...,"... when I was a 15 year old acolyte.I won't go into details, because I can see there are enough reviews here to fill everyone in on the plot. The first third of the book I found, not tiresome really, but let's say forgettable. I really didn't get into this book until then. But things picked up, and as it happens, I really enjoyed most of the rest of the book. That was until I was nearly done. I'll grant that a happy ending sells better than disaster, but I bought a book titled ""The Last Day"". So, what happened to the last day? I'll even allow that the title may have referred to a different Last Day, perhaps the last day of Jeza's life or the last day of war, conflict and suffering on earth. But even though I'm no expert on Eschatology, last I heard, Armageddon wasn't an event that could be averted. To put it plainly, I fully expected to read about THE Last Day, and it just never came about. What a sore disappointment."
2,Big Disappointment,"I'm certainly no fan of organized religion and I enjoy seeing hypocrites get taken down a knotch, but this is a terrible novel. After some of the glowing reviews here, I was very disappointed. What begins as a run-of-the-mill thriller becomes a very long, boring, no-surprises, paperback trash read. The lengthy diatribes against Catholics seemed to border on bigotry and ignorance and made this non-Catholic wonder about the motives of the writer. Pretty vile stuff at times.I didn't finish the final 200 pages, but from flipping through them, they are as bad as the first 400. I just didn't want to invest more time in it. There must be a lot of readers angry at religion to generate some of the remarkably positive reviews posted. I love good novels and I'm just not angry enough myself to forgive this book its many faults and unfortunate excesses. Besides, its awful."
3,"HEY, the author tried!","Pretty good slash and burn job on Christians here. Too preachy itself for my taste and waaaay to easy on the Vatican. Jeza could have been more Christlike and less New age - Cosmo editorialish. Still, the writer's intent was to humiliate the Church, and he has succeeded somewhat. I just wish a more capable writer would try it. THAT would be worth my time and money."
5,Hooray!,"Finally, somebody had the courage to tell it like it is! The real god of the world's organized religions is money, backed by powerful men hell bent on preserving their patriarchal bureaucracies. This novel explores so many explosive issues in such surprising and fascinating ways, all bundled into a nail- biting suspense story..."
1,Poorly Done,"Great Premise, but Bad Book. The writing is crude and the plot development is amateurish. The usual stock characters speak comic book dialog that is simply embarrassing. The issues addressed are handled on a Weekly World News level and the messiah is one of the least interesting feminist warriors I've run across. A hungry puppy wouldn't follow her home. This novel had me reeling in pain at its crassness when I wasn't stunned by incredulity. Pick any other millenial thriller and its bound to be more intelligent than this putrid tale."
2,ok I guess,A stupid thriller that seems to have important things to say. OK if you've nothing to read but be prepared for terrible writing and a negative view of all religion from a pretty uninformed author.
2,"Well, it is a good idea...","In the hands of a master (i.e. James Morrow or Daniel Easterman) this novel could have been a devastating depiction of a millenial Second Coming. Unfortunately, poor writing and heavy, heavy handedness ruins a great concept and the story possibilities are turned into a cheap attack on organized religion. Perfect fodder for the movie of the week which is its destiny, a skilled screenwriter may give the concept all that this book lacks: Sensitivity, Intelligence, and Depth. Hopefully, the original author, his narrow mindedness, and the airhead characters he created (or cloned from many other thrillers) will not be part of the tv movie's creative process. Don't just wait for paperback, wait for tv on this one."
2,I Would Agree With Others Further Down This Page,"What a piece of garbage. Poorly written and hardly researched, the author knows nothing of Israel and less of the New Testament. Designed to be controversial, it wastes a wonderful idea by becoming silly New Age mumbo jumbo. A time waster for the spiritually deprived."
2,My Humble Opinion,"The reader(s) who express their admiration for this novel seem to focus their reviews on attacking those who dislike it. There are many intelligently considered negative reviews on this page of which I agree, specifically as they register astonishment at the bad writing and lack of character development. On the basis of this being a flimsy thriller, I believe a rating of four is generous. As to the ""great book"" status, I can only express incredulity. The positive reviews seem very extreme in their praise, some slightly delusional. This is only a thriller, people. Good or bad, it's hardly deserving of such emotional notice. The idea that only one reader has written negatively concerning the novel is particularly ridiculous as at least three other members of our reader's circle have submitted some thoughtful criticism here and encouraged me to do so as well. It appears a one person campaign in support of the book is more is more in evidence and disturbingly odd if actual."
5,Great escape,"This is my kind of novel, fast-paced, highly original concept, well executed. Not only entertaining, but educational. Fascinating history and insights into things most people can only imagine or glimpse from afar. I put this up there as one of the best suspense novels I've ever come across."
3,Read These Reviews,"The reviews on this page are far more entertaining than the book! They are certainly more thoughtful and intelligent. For the most part, the reviews are also better written (but that is faint praise). I would wait a little while for the paperback, try to find this on a bestseller or awards list, and enjoy these reviews in the meantime. You will save yourself some money and have a more meaningful experience. Or wait until the tv writer makes some sense of this ridiculous mess in the ""highly anticipated miniseries."" Oh, Wow."
3,Amused,"I'm amused by the persistence of the reviewer(s) here that find it incomprehensible that anyone who isn't part of a ""conspiracy"", a fanatic, or mentally ill could possibly give Last Day less than the highest rating. Here I am, hopefully none of the above. While I found the basis of the story fascinating, it was quickly lost in terrible writing. The characters are very poorly defined, especially Jeza, who gets more irritating as the story lumbers along. I thought the religious ""message"" which is delivered ad nauseum (big religion is bad) was hardly unique. It seems to me this is an average thriller, very roughly written, which seems, for some odd reason, to be taken too seriously by gullible readers. Discriminating readers might check those claims of fantastic press reviews for themselves. Just my humble opinion. Greg Tobin"
2,What a Disappointment,"Really below average and a let down after the stuff I read here. Not only poorly written, but dull and uninteresting. I have to say that whatever their sources, the bad reviews are right on the money with this book and put it pretty well. Just because it was sold to the movies doesn't mean the author can write worth a darn."
2,What a chump!,"I've got to admit the right wing radical conspiracy stunt worked. I threw $20 away on this because I thought the negative reviews came from the fundamentalists. After finally finishing Last Day, I agree with those who have cited bad writing, amateur plotting, and excessive ax-grinding as criticism. The positive reviews make no sense at all in light of the fact this is an overblown potboiler that targets the church for the old Vatican Bank scandal. I thought the people and speeches were ignorant, especially Jeza, the supposed messiah who behaved like a vindictive child throughout. If I could do it again I would have ignored the ridiculous 10's and taken the reviews of 5 or less seriously."
3,fair,"Odd blend of scifi and anti-religion tract that just doesn't work. Author's obsessive hatred of Catholics gets outrageous and made me feel uncomfortable. Good plot, but not a very good read. Fair yet disappointing."
2,Shallow Digs,"This amateur attempt to pierce the petrified hide of organized religion and expose inane sacred tenants is very feeble. Poor writing and superficial understanding defeats a clever plot. For wit and intelligence try the masters: Gore Vidal's ""Live From Golgotha"" and James Morrow's ""Towing Jehovah."" These two novels are superior in every aspect to this nonsense and you won't be wasting your time or money. Last Day is pale in comparison and quite forgettable. Morrow and Vidal's work is hauntingly brilliant."
5,Inspiring,"I, too, found this story remarkable. I especially loved the several parables that pop up here and there. My two favorites were: The Inventor's Sons, and The Illicit Child. The themes sounded in this novel are refreshingly noble and fly in the face of conventional, conservative religious thought. This author has taken a huge risk in upsetting the rigid-minded bible thumpers, and I'm not surprised at their reactions on this page. But it's about time someone had the courage to stand up against religious fraud and tyranny. Like all prophets who defy the established religious order, this one's getting persecuted. His story tells it like it is, boldly and honestly. A thrilling tale well worth the price of admission."
5,Sophisticated satire,"One of the keenest looks at contemporary religion I've ever come across. Sharply written satire that bites hard at religious hype and hypocrasy and exposes all that's wrong with modern day organized religions. There's much to learn from this story, as it is incredibly well researched and true to the tenets of the many faiths and locales referenced here. But even better, it's a rich mystery/thriller that manages to take a scary, supernatural event and render it completely real and believable. But let the reader beware, this is not for thin-skinned religious people, and if you have no tolerance for views contrary to your own, this isn't a book for you."
4,"ok, umm, it's a book.","I really think that most of you need to relax a little. It's a book. Not all of us have blind faith in organized religion, and we like to see those of you who do get all worked up when someone doesn't share your beliefs. Too much fun."
1,Is there less than one star?,"I don't know what this book is considered but a thriller it is not. That would require suspense and thrills. It won't win any prizes for writing either. Not being Catholic, I don't know if the church bashing is accurate, only that it got pretty ugly and took-up too many pages. I hated the obnoxious messiah character - nasty, spiteful, one-dimensional, and plain dumb. Who'd follow that weirdo. She had me feeling sorry for the members of all the religions she condemns. Even the Mormons! I think this is a dreary, depressing read that has little of interest in it. Who told this author he could write? Who would recommend a turkey like this?"
3,Good and Bad,"I enjoyed the story and the characters, but was very put off by the foul language, especially when it was used in the same context as God. I would have enjoyed the book a LOT more without the cursing."
5,The best epic thriller written to date!,This book is now my measuring stick for all thrillers that I read in the future. Every book I've read since has fallen short. Says what people only think about religion and the Church. Thought provoking and exciting right from page one. Great characters and a great story line. The ultimate mix of science and theology. Do not pass it up!
1,Religious Ignorance Run Amuck,"The premise might yield a good and compelling story in the hands of an author who actually knew something about Jewish Messianism at the beginning of the common era and something about both the history of Catholicism and contemporary Judism.As it is the story is a really good example of anti-Christianity, anti-Judism and anti-history all garbed in a simplistic mellenniumism dished up as literature.The author would done well to have taken a course or two in historical criticism, or if he did it's a sad commentary on his teachers.This assumes that he is interested in something other than the power of money which he portrays as one of the pivotal motives of the religous ""bad guys"" he caricaturises in this work."
2,Silly Nonsense,"This is not much of a thriller. As for some kind of deep meaning, is someone kidding? The ""message"" of this book is downright silly and casting this author as some kind of brilliant iconoclast is like calling the staff of Weekly World News journalists. The plot is dumb, the characters cartoonish, and the sermonizing laughable. The clunky writing is pure misery.And there's too much writing! Over-the-top, silly nonsense, and a bizare ego-trip for a writer that never knows when enough is enough. It does succeed in killing many hours of a reader's life, if that's what you want in a book."
2,Awful,"Poor writing, superficial characters, female stereotypes, and dumb dialog highlight this silly, uniformed comic book story. Overblown, uninformed, and basically senseless. Two stars for a wonderful premise, wasted completely in an over-long vanity opus that is pretentious and embarassingly self-important. There's hardly a thing worthy of analysis here, but suffice it to say this illiterate mess is not ""the best book I ever read."""
4,Well done.,A creative twist on Revelations and our times. Enjoyable and thought provoking. A new Sermon on the Mount that surpasses the legalism that plagues modern religion.
2,"Interesting, but everone it is JUST A NOVEL! Pure fiction.","First of all I would like to point out that Jeza is a FICTITIOUS character.This tome would have been far more interesting and would have held my attention had it been half the length. 600 pages is laborious and presumptious. The characters were largely two dimensional. I had to force myself to finish this book, but some friends loaned it to me and wanted to discuss it, so I slogged through it.Less is more."
1,"Significant Delay vs the ""Pro"" version","While this unit does what it says, there is a significant delay between when you use the sliders and the command being sent out to the lights. I compared this right next to the 'pro' version, which has zero delay, and this version feels worthless. The delay between what you do on the sliders and what happens to the light is absolutely atrocious... and my test rig only used 1 light linked directly to the board (I can't imagine how bad it is with MANY lights)."
5,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK IN THE SERIES,"This book was focused on the other children of Marty and Clark.Very little was mentioned of Missie and Willie, and I didn't know if I would be interested in it. I was!!! I love Ellie and Lane. There were heartbreaking moments, also. Overall, must read again."
3,for my kids,"my doctor give this to my kids becouse my kids have aweakness and thay need to a dietary supplement to support immune system, circulatory, cardiovascular and neurological functions, muscle recover and endurance"
2,It would be a terrific CD if....,"This CD release if NOT the complete double-LP. A number of tracks were omitted. As such, I urge you to procede with caution, by checking the track list against the LP to determine if any of your favorite tracks were chopped."
4,Monk Meets the Hep Cats,"Got this in 84' when lp's(double) still ruled and was sparked by all the talent associated with this project.Love Jazz but my soul is in Rock. Todd the Amazing is on this with Gary Windo(alto) doing ""Four in One"" that will make your head spin. Steve Khan,Frampton,Chris Spedding all give steller performances. If your taste runs to Fusion,blues,pop and love the masters of jazzwith new interpetations give this a spin. You can say hi to John Zorn(get anything this man does!) on this too. Can you dig it--- I thought you could!"
3,"Ours works fine, but...","they really could have used a higher quality LCD screen on this product. I find it to be REALLY slow to react, and leaves trails behind images as they move. My son doesn't mind, but he is only 3. When he needs help from me on a game, the slow screen drives me crazy. Makes a generally decent product seem cheap.The games look & react so much better on our standard V.Smile system for the TV. But my little guy enjoys the portable unit, so I guess that is what matters."
1,this sucks,my daughter got this for christmas and it started shuting off automatically in 2 hrs after she got it. do NOT waste your money on this. we have the vsmile console and it is great and she wanted the pocket version and she has cried since she got it. now she wants a gameboy. Please dont allow any more children to be disappointed.
2,3rd times the charm???,We are about to return this for the third time. It just shuts down for no reason. We have not been able to get one to work for more than a month. Luckily we bought the warranty offered by Toys R Us but what do we do when that runs out? Our other V-smile system that plugs into the T.V. only lasted one year. They offer fun games but are very poorly made. We tried to contact the company but we were just given the run around. We will be moving on to Gameboy from now on.
2,Buy LeapFrog instead,"I bought my child a Leapfrog Leapster L-Max for Christmas, and his grandparents bought him this toy. I must say that both me and his grandparents are unhappy with the V-tech. The graphics are bad, and get extremely blurry when the characters start moving. The game does cut off a lot, which may be bacause of the amount of batteries it eats or due to some technical problems that some people have been noticing. My son will play with it occasionally, but prefers his leapster. There are so many advantages that the L-Max has over this system, and they cost about the same."
1,Not worth the money or time,"My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas and was very excited. We put in batteries and tried several games, but it turned off about 2 minutes into playing the games. We purchased 7 games and none of them seem to work. If you contact the manufacturer, they want you to pay for shipping to mail it back. Wow. I exchanged it for another new one, it was the exact same. And the charger is crazy. It works sometimes. A friend and I have had the exact same problems with both the pocket v-smile and the charger. It seems that it's pretty common. They just do not work."
1,More system board problems,"This is our third vsmile. We've had 2 of the TV versions and then one of my kids got this for Christmas. Less than a month later its now doing the same as both the TV versions eventually did. It will only turn on if there is no game in it. If there is a game, any game, in the slot nothing works. New batteries, using the power cord, hitting reset, or plugging it in to a TV makes no difference.Oh, and the LCD was really crappy. The viewing angle is terrible.So good games that the kids love, and really poorly made hardware."
1,DO NOT BUY,"We've never owed a V Smile, but the V Smile Pocket is horrible! The graphics are so blurry that my 4yr old had a headache after 1 minute of playing. She told me it's too hard to see Pooh momma. So I returned it to get a L Max, I'm so glad I did. This is just not a good product."
1,"great game, if you don't mind hitting reset every 2 minutes!","We have the Vsmile and the Vsmile pocket. Both great games, but you need to push the little pinhole-sized 'reset' thing in the back like every 2 minutes to keep the game working. VERY FRUSTRATING!"
4,Great System BUT There's A Catch,I have twin three year old girls that each have a pocket system. (They outgrew my first Leap Pad at 2 1/2.) The systems are great but the screens scratch very easily. The girls are supervised while playing because they are so young. I would recommend that parents buy the screen films that are used on pda's to protect the screen. It's too late for our systems. The 800 number is useless. Your call is picked up overseas and they repeat prewritten answers. The games are challenging and are great for long trips.
1,Waste of money!,"We have the regular Vsmile and bought the handheald because we thought it would be perfect in the car. We got it home, plugged it in and it worked great on the tv. We tried to use the handheld version and none of his old games would come one the screen, only the game it came with. My husband brought it back to the store and got another one.The second one worked fine in the store, and for one game at home, then again the screen would not show the game for him. We could hear the audio but not see the game. After two tries I think we are going to give up! What a waste of time and money!!"
2,Problems with VSmile,"I really like the V-Smile, the games are wonderful and my boys love it. I can't give it a better rating though because it doesn't always work. The battery compartment seems rather flimsy and the batteries slip out often causing it to freeze up. Then the panel needs to be unscrewed and the batteries plugged back in. Sometimes it freezes up and just won't work. If you leave it alone for a while then come back to it it will work again."
1,Terrible...Unit died in less than a month,"This would be a great system...if it worked!!!! I bought the V Smile Handheld for my 4 year-old daughter for Christmas 05. In less than 3 weeks the unit stopped for no reason. We had the system replaced; however, that unit died in less than a month. V Tech will not provide any assistance for the problems. Please don't waste your money on this product!!! Your child will be in tears after they have played it just long enough to be devastated when it crashes and you will be enraged with anger, finding yourself left with no solution other than posting these messages to others on every website and forum that rates this product."
1,Won't last long,"My son has had this for almost a year. It went from being a wonderful toy, to giving us problems with the batteries lossening and having to restart it. Now it started freezing games and barely work for more then a few minutes without giving problems. We finally gave up on this and he will be getting a new system for his birthday this year. Save your money don't purchase this product!!!!"
2,V.Smile system for my son,"I love the games and my son is learning so much from them but the system itself keeps failing, this is the second one we have bought because my 4 year old son loves the games but they seem to have a lot of problems and it is starting to cost us too much money to have to keep replacing the system after a few months, we also noticed a problem with the electrical cord and had to replace it three time,If someone was to purchase this I would highly recommend getting an extented warrenty."
3,Good when it works,"A real battery hogger, it also crashes at times. Haven't tried using an adapter but I would highly recommend buying one. Also the screen picture quality could be better."
2,5 STARS WHEN IT WORKS!,"My son received the V-Smile Pocket 4 days ago for his birthday from my grandmother. In the first 2 days he used it constantly and mastered the 3 games he got (Wiggles, Bob the builder, Finding Nemo) quite well. During those 2 days we went through a 20 pack of batteries like they were water and we noticed the game kept shutting off. We blew it off and thought it was just him messing with it. Now the thing won't work at all! If you jiggle the game it will come on for a bit, but the slightest movement and the thing shuts off. So, I've been spending my time with a toddler following me around asking me to fix his game. He loves this thing so much that I had to hide it from him and take him to the toy store to get something else! The biggest problem for me is telling my grandmother, who was so proud to get such a great gift, that it's nothing but a piece of junk."
1,Very bad quality toy,"Don't waste your money on this!! Ever since my child got it, it turned off at random and finally just quit altogether, less than a year after she got it. Since it was unreliable, she hardly played with it, so it didn't quit from overuse. It's too bad that the Pocket is such bad quality. I wish I had returned it when it first started acting up. It seems like such a fun toy, but don't be fooled... and don't buy it."
2,Not happy with the graphics,"I purchased the V Smile pocket as a Christmas present for my 4 year old son, and decided I had better test it out before Christmas morning to make sure it was working. Boy am I glad I did. He already has a game boy advance that we allow him to play for half an hour a day, and it has extremely crisp, clear graphics. The V Smile pockets' graphics are not so good. I had purchased two cartridges to go with it (Elmo and Pooh) and on both of them whenever the character moved at all he got blurry. And if you are in a part of the game that has a scrolling screen the ENTIRE SCREEN is blurry until you stop. I think this is a really great concept for a toy, but I think it could use some tweaking. I returned this. I think I might try a Leapster L-Max and see if the graphics are any cleaner on that."
5,A GREAT HANDHELD EDUCATIONAL UNIT,"We purchaed the handheld last month and my daughter loves it. We also have the console unit. My children love taking this with them on car rides and to the grandparents house. I wish this came out first and we may have purchased two of these for our children instead of the console. The pocket requires a little more coordination than the joystick with the console. My two year old does well with the console joystick where he can't maneuver the pocket. My four and five year old seem to like the pocket better. I love the Vsmile education games. I love the praise the games give them and helps to build their confidence while learning also. They aren't so competitive. As we have the leapsters as well, I feel these are both great products and you can't go wrong with any of them.MOM of 3 in Alabama"
3,It's Great When It Works....,"I bought 2 vsmile pocket handheld players for my sons ages 4 and 6 for Christmas. After opening them on Christmas morning we found that one didn't work - sound but no picture. We returned it to the store where it was purchased - no problem - and exchanged it for an unopened box. That was yesterday. The exchanged player lasted until this morning. The player that had worked on Christmas does not work at all now. So, I now have 2 vsmile pocket players and two disappointed children. We are going to try and exchange both tonight at the store - again - but it's really getting to be more trouble than it's worth. My kids loved the games and even my 8 year old got in on the action, but an $80 present should last for more than a day. I would recommend investing that money in good old fashioned books as an alternative to something that doesn't work for more than 24 hours. I've had happy meal games that lasted longer."
2,Screen Problems,"Like others have said, the screen blurs badly with games in motion.I have viewed the Pooh game & Thomas game on this and they both blur badly. I think they need to improve this. I do intend on exchanging this. I do not want my sons eyes damaged by this.My son has the console model which I recommend big time over this one! He is three and also likes it better.Hopefully they will fix this soon, because the idea of a take along v-smile is a great idea!"
2,It would be great if only it would work.,"My daughter received a V-Smile Pocket for her 6th birthday last year and loved it. She played it a couple of times a week for 8 months, until it abruptly stopped working. I believe it has a short in it because if the screen is facing down, it works fine, but if you flip it up so you could actually play it, it shuts off. The company recommended self-helps are worthless.My daughter received another one for her 7th birthday (gotta love grandparents), and that worked 4 days before it shorted out. It turns on just fine, but shuts itself off unless held in some bizarre, stationary position. Totally worthless for a portable unit.It's a great concept, but it's caused nothing but tears for my daughter, arguements with the customer service people in various locales over returns for me, and one worthless call to V-Tech. Too bad that a great product can't work a week.Recommendations: Get the base unit, which has lasted us 3 years+. Don't waste your money on the Pocket."
3,Not worth it!,"My son has had his VSmile Pocket for 2 years now. We have gone through 3 rechargable batteries and it's dead...again! I'm so tired of buying new rechargable batteries! I thought the point of a rechargable battery was so you wouldn't HAVE to buy a new one! Now I just got him the adapter that plugs into the wall. It's not convenient, but he loves playing it so much that he doesn't mind. He's 5 years old and loves all the games he has. It's a great educational toy, but if I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy it again for this whole battery situation."
1,It won't turn off!!!!,"I just purchased the VSmile pocket for my son so he would quit trying to get at his Dads PSP. We got him the Vsmile box for christmas and haven't had any problems with it at all and he loves to play his games on it. However the vsmile pocket WONT TURN OFF!!! We haven't even had it 24 hours and there are already problems with it. It is a poorly built gaming device and the batteries won't stay in either because of the little metal loops that are under two of the batteries which makes it so those two won't stay in securely. It is a pain in the rear to have to unscrew the battery plate to fix the batteries. I will be taking this back and hopefully the store will give me a full refund. I'd get my son a gameboy, but the games available for it just don't offer the educational or skill benefits that the vsmile does."
2,Thought it would be better,"I bought the vsmile pocket for my 4 yr old. He loves it, but it seems to shut off quite often. I keep on having to change the batteries, and even with new ones it still just shuts off when hes playing.I would have to say don't buy it until they improve this product because as I can see I'm not the only one having this problem. I am going to try to return it.I have the bigger V smile that connects to the tv. that works great."
2,Not what we expected...,"We have the original V-Smile console that hooks to the TV and the boys love it! We decided to buy the v-smile pocket so they could play anywhere. The screen was blurry when the games were moving. We also had trouble with the system freezing up frequently. We would have to push the reset button on the back to un-freeze it. This is frustrating when in the middle of a game because then you have to start over. We returned ours and luckily got a full refund from the store we purchased it from. While we love the original V-smile, I would recomend the leapster handheld (from Leapfrog) over the V-smile pocket. We have had no issues with the leapster system."
2,Breaks very easily,"My children loved this toy - but it sucked up batteries like crazy! So we bought the rechargeable battery pack, which never worked. After only 2 months it has stopped working completely - it won't even turn on. I have called the company but they are unwilling to help. Poor product with even worse customer service."
1,Don't waste your money! Great concept poor quality toy!,"I had decided to purchase this toy for our 4 year old son's birthday. We already had the V Smile system (which stopped working correctly after 5 months), so I decided to buy this one so when we go long car trips he could play. Well the first time we tried to use the system it would not read any of the games or even turn on for that matter. The system would turn on without a game, but not with any games in it. Took it back and contacted V Smile about the issues I had with their toys and I was never contacted. Great concept, when the V Smile system works my son loves it but the company needs to fix their products!"
1,JUNK,"My 3 year son received the V Smile Pocket for Christmas. He played it for maybe 2 hours. The next day it would not come on. My husband replaced the batteries which lasted all of one day. We decided to get rechargeable batteries which only allowed play time for maybe 1 hour at the most. We decided to purchase the Pocket charger which worked great for a week then it started to turn itself off and on. My 3 year old loves to play on it when it works but you never know when it will work. We keep having to reset it and then it only lets you get so far and then freezes. Also you have to jiggle the games and sometimes blow on them to get them just to turn on. I would not waste my money on this. After seeing the other reviews of how V-Smile will not do anything about these so called ""bad batches"" I will purchase items by Leapfrog they stand by there equipment. Our next purchase will be the L-Max. It may cost more but in this case we got what we paid for!!"
3,It's OK but not durable enough,"I like the V-smile joystick style so when this handheld version came out, I sure bought it right away. I like the portability but it died out in few months of usage. The joystick version is still working but this one say goodbye:("
1,So many video games....,"Maybe my kids are just weird, but we got this for Christmas and it was played with once by my 5 year old and then never again. I checked it out to see if it was educational and it is, but my kids just don't seem to be fixated on video game systems like so many other kids are. It's pretty pricey, thankfully, I didn't pay for it. I just feel that some kids can learn better if you sit down with them and go through workbooks. I mean really do we need another gaming system that really only acts as a temporary babysitter. My kids get bored with video games very fast. Their new thing is using their imagination to ward off godzilla. Who knew that with all the toys out there they would rather play pretend."
2,LEAPSTER'S STILL THE BEST,Vtech can try to compete with the LEAPSTER but there's no competition. LEAPSTER totally blows it out the market. The LEAPSTER is so much better and also has a larger game library. My 4 year old has played with his LEAPSTER since he was 2 and he still loves it.Soon LEAPFROG will be coming out with LMAX which is a handheld game like the LEAPSTER but it can also be played on TV like the VSMILE but 10 times better than VSMILE OFCOURSE. he'll be getting that one also.
2,"SECOND ONE, BOTH QUIT WORKING.","We love the Pocket V-smile...if it would only WORK!We first bought the regular V-smile that hooks up to the TV, and loved that they came out with a Pocket V-smile that we could take with us. Best of all the cartridges were interchangable between the two V-smiles. However, a few days after buying the Pocket V-Smile it began turning off on it's own for no apparent reason. We returned it for a new one and unfortunatly have had the same problem with the second one. We even bought the charger thinking it might have been a battery issue, but the charger only seemed to make matters worse.I hope they can fix the issues with this system, until then don't waste your money."
1,Keep your money.,"This product is a dud. It worked for less than a year. It consumed batteries and after buying the recharging station, the game system died. Save your money and buy a product from a different manufacturer."
2,Great games/kids love it - BUT It doesnt work,"I wish I would of read your reviews before I bought this, our first one just died, I bought another and within a week - that one just died. I feel so bad for my son because he loves the games, those are great. But, I am upset because I have invested so much money in the games that its just not easy to dump and purchase the Leapster, so I suggest to read these reviews carefully and think twice before buying this product. I had Vtech send me a new one, I am not paying for anymore."
2,It's was great while it worked.,The V Smile handheld is a great option for younger children who like video games but need educational toys. The only problem is that does not work consistently. From the time it was opened on Christmas day until now we've had trouble with it. Originally it had to be reset as least twice daily until now when it doesn't work at all. For $[...] the game should work consistently not to mention that it is geared toward younger children who may not understand the concept of a faulty games.
1,Cheaply Made,My daughter is on her 2nd V Smile and this one only worked for a day. Now she is out another one.
5,The V-Smile Pocket is the BEST!,"My son is 4 1/2 and quite good at most video games. He plays his sister's Gamecube and Daddys PS2 with no problems. We bought him the regular V-smile for Christmas last year and he liked it pretty well, but not doing back flips for it. I was looking into a Leapster when I came across the V-smile Pocket. I figured since we already had the games I'd give it a try. Boy am I glad I did! My son LOVES this system! It goes with us everywhere in the car and he sits and plays it for hours! He is learning math and is remembering it! Several of my friends have sworn by Leapster, and cannot believe how sturdy the Pocket is considering it gets hauled all over the place. I know at least 3 moms that will be replacing their Leapsters with Pockets this fall! The price is right and the games are easy to play for little kids and challenging enough for my nine year old to sit down and play as well. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!"
1,crap,"Bought the console and it was very tempermental.Very difficult to keep on and would shut off for no apparent reason. I doubt we got 20 hrs of play out of it.I finally threw it out. Bought the hand held because we had so much invested in the games and had better sucess and then bought another one. Neither lasted very long. Paid $20 for and adpater and the cord broke off. Ticked off that I've spent several hundred dollars for a pile of chunk. From what I read on here, I should have bought a Leap Frog and will never buy anything v tech again!"
2,V-Smile Becomes V-Sadface,"We had built up a fairly large library of V-Smile games for the V-Smile console, and our son wanted the handheld version. It's not built well at all. The cartridges wobble around in the socket and constantly lose contact, so the thing either resets or locks up at the slightest touch.My in-laws bought my son a replacement, the version with the built-in drawing pad. That was no better in the stability department. These devices just aren't up for the indelicate play of children."
1,A wonderful work but this isn't the best English version.,"The Conference of the Birds is a marvellous book--a sufi treatise on the spiritual life written in Persian rhyming couplets. This translation is not in poetry, but in rather dull prose. In addition the translator leaves out a number of the stories that make up the bulk of the work. He mistranslates at a few crucial points.I would recommend instead the extraordinary translation by Dick Davis and Afkham Darbandi. With great skill the whole work is translated into rhyming couplets like the original. Davis' rhythm and rhyme carry you through the work at a cracking pace, unlike the plodding prose of this version. Davis and Darbandi's translation is in the Penguin Classics series, ISBN 0140444343, also available from Amazon, where you can see a sample of their work."
3,Drifter Adventure,"The author does a nice job weaving multiple plot-lines in this ""Drifter Adventure."" Shades of Jack K. seep into the well-written prose. An interesting read."
2,"Agree with other reviews, slot is too big","The only other cover I could find wouldn't fit my power strip so I ordered this one. It seems sturdy and does fit fine, but the opening is way too big. My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could. I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening."
4,Make sure you measure your power strip,"I like this and will probably order another one, but I had to switch out the power strip I wanted to originally use it for because the strip was too long. So, other than that it is great."
4,Works well,Great product...just makes it a bit difficult if it is not a strip where plugs remain...to remove and then to put a power cord back in the strip takes some time but it serves it's #1 function to keep my toddler out of it and safe
1,For real? The baby's whole hand fits in this.,"Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is."
4,Great for powerstrips.........,Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.
3,"Works well, but not exactly baby proof","This power strip cover is meant to be a baby-safe product, but even though I do like it and it leaves enough space for even thick cords and wide plugs, my daughter can stick her hand right down in there. That fact pretty much defeats the purpose of even having the cover. But it does at least make the whole thing look less appealing to her, so she doesn't bother it too much. But the slot really should be narrower."
3,Good could be better,This is the best one to house power strips with some oversized plugs. Opens and closes easily for me just have to push in the buttons. We have it kind of tucked away so it is fine for our needs. It could be better because i was able to put in 2 plugs after it was closedand everything the gap on top is wider than we would like. Hey the price is really good and it does the basic job of deterrance because lets face it if our kids want to get into something they are but if it is kind of blocked off maybe they won't want to.
5,Perfect for the mother who is babyproofing!,Love this product. This is the 3rd cover I've purchased in the last couple of months. I think the quality on the safety 1st cover is much better than the competing powerstrip covers. At least I know that my child won't be playing with the plugs now.
5,Works perfect,"We have two power strip covers at our house--one by safety 1st and the other by Mommy's Helper. The Safety 1st cover far exceeds the quality and durability of the Mommy's Helper cover (whose buckles looked like they might break if opened too often.) I like the Safety 1st cover because it allows for adjustability in length and is very wide inside, as well as looking quite sturdy. There was plenty of width inside ours as well, so I'm no sure what other reviews were referring to. For extra safety, we covered the unused sockets on the strip with plugs...wish I had purchased this one first!"
1,It barely restricts access to the outlets!,"It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks."
1,Opening is big enough for child to get hands in,This powerstrip cover is pointless. Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.
1,Useless,My nine month old just pulled three plugs out through the large opening in the top of the cover. I plugged them bag in without opening it - as another reviewer remarked it it easy for a baby to stick their hands in.
1,Doesn't even get 1 star if I had the choice....,"Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them."
3,"Great idea, wish it were wider.","This was a great buy if you have a slender power strip, and I would whole heartedly recommend it. If you own wider power strips, though, it doesn't fit them."
1,Plugs pull right out and little hands can fit right in.,Length:: 0:46 MinsThis video shows the Safety 1st Power Strip Cover installed on an average size power strip. You can see how the plugs can be pulled right out of the strip and then the cover. It also lets you see how large the opening is and that it may be large enough for a small child's hand to get into.
3,Halting,"I really wish I could respond more enthusiastically to this CD. I like Stern's approach to Beethoven very much, especially later in his career. His set of the sonatas from the 1980's with Eugene Istomin is a great favorite of mine. On this recording of the Concerto, Stern plays with great sensitivity, phrasing intimately and articulating beautifully. The playing of the orchestra under Barenboim is beyond reproach. Unfortunately, Stern's tone is not always agreeable. Very often his playing sounds stringy and rough. There's no doubt that as an interpreter he has the full measure of the score. The only problem is that passage after passage that should sound beautiful doesn't. The sound engineering isn't to blame; it is clear and full, typical of the best results from the locale of Manhattan Center. I suspect Stern just was having an off day. If you are looking for an inexpensive recording of this Concerto, I would recommend Takako Nishizaki's on Naxos."
3,Good news and Bad,"As I stated in the title there good and bad to this item, the sword itself felt nice, grip was good, and it like amazing however as pleased as I was with all that and very pleased with it there was a lot of bad to it as well. It did arrive on the last day stated but that was 2 weeks after the order was but in so it did take a while to get here. Also the packing was terrible it was wrapped in shrink warp and that's it, nothing else to protect it. And the hand guard which everyone on here seems to complain about on this item anyways I did not even receive, so I will never know if it is as bad as people have stated. As I said though it's still a nice look sword and good to practice and for the price you really can't complain to much about the down side to it, so if you can handle a little sloppiness then it's a good buy other wise steer clear of this item."
2,It's a Stick,"For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck? What ever happened to quality control? It came double shrink wrapped. There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away. Very little pride in the product. The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted. Well, it's just a stick afterall. I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects. Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback. Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars. I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo."
3,"It's an ""Okay"" Video",Good video for beginners to learn how their riding affects the horse. I only gave it 3 stars because the dressage saddle on the gray horse was girthed way too far forward and the rider was interfering with his movement. This is a contradiction of the video subject matter and someone of Susan Harris's credentials should have known better.
5,Great Deal,"My daughter and I love this book. The instructions are very easy to follow, and the pictures in the book are great. The projects are easy and fun, and the resulting jewelry is very nice looking. There are enough beads and string to do lots of projects. The kit includes everything you will need to do the projects, except scissors. This book would be great for a younger child or a teenager."
1,Only worth the $$ to get the cable,"Software has been a headache. Every single time I start-up the software it has to go through the whole thing of reacquiring my cell phone make and model. EVERY time. (last software kit for prior phone automatically recognized the phone. this software doesn't even store what phone it's being used with)Aside from hook-up issues, the applications are simply rudimentary. You won't be wow'd. You won't wonder 'How did I get by without that?'. You won't run and tell your friends.If I hadn't bought this is a desperation Christmas-time sale for 60% off I'd be very ticked. But for about $12 I suppose I can try to deal with it...."
4,Good but expensive,There's a drive-in movie theater that a young woman has inherited. She wants to keep it open and the female employees wear bikinis to attract customers. There is a lot of gratuitous nudity. There is a washing scene with garden hoses and buckets and sponges that is really an Oscar winning show of bodacious bodies.
3,"No story, hot girls","There is no story. Only 2 erotic scenes, but the girls in the bikini's make it up. Good in it's genre"
5,Especially recommended for school & community libraries.,"Zuri Jackson and Danitra Brown are best friends facing a long summer apart, for Danitra is going to visit her family in the country. They decide to cultivate a series of letters sharing their summer: this presents their insights, with Floyd Cooper providing the illustrative embellishments."
1,never received it,"i never received the patch cord,ups says they left it on the porch,too much hassle to get a hold of a human at amazon,im out 11 bucks."
3,"Not as bad as I feared, not as good as I hoped...","When I saw this DVD boxed set, I got the sneaking suspicion that a production company was simply trying to unload some excess inventory. But I decided to get it, because I love female action heroes, and it was a pretty good deal- ten movies for under twenty bucks. Well the results, as it turned out, were somewhat uneven. There are some good ones (Sister Street Fighter in particular is loaded with great action scenes) and some that were simply awful (Street Angels had very little action and must have had a budget of about ten bucks), while others had their own merits (TNT Jackson is simply hilarious, a blaxploitation kung fu movie in which the fighters don't even come close to hitting each other!). All in all, the movies have their moments, but if you're into badass action movies with female leads, then I suggest going the Hong Kong ""bullets and breasts"" route, or maybe tracking down some Russ Meyer movies."
4,The Three Penny Opera,I recieved the product promptly and in an undamaged condition. I would certainly use the service again.
3,The Business of Writing For Children,"The book was okay, but I guess I expected more info than I received from reading it."
1,Negative 4 Stars - do not recommend,"Unfortunately this is not worthy to wear the Stanley name. It requires greater microwave time to heat the something as simple as chicken soup. Although I may screw the top on when the soup is still boiling inside, 4.5 hours later the soup is only lukewarm and the thermos has been stored in my office all day - not on a job site or in a cold truck. Don't think you can heat your food on the stove and then put it in this thermos after heating the thermos in the microwave with water because that doesn't work either. For all the bulk of it, it can't hold a standard 18.5oz soup, ie. Progresso. Instead of making my morning lunch prep easier and faster it made it harder and longer. I just bought the Stanley Outdoor Food Vacuum Jar 20oz - and am thrilled. It took me 5 min to bring my can of soup to a boil this morning - I poured it in the thermos and at noon it was still hot!"
4,Stanley Heatkeeper is ok!,"I bought this at Fred Meyer priced at $8.99. You can't expect ""plastic material"" for any food thermo to keep food hot all day long. If it's stainless steel on the inside like Stanley's Vaccum Wide-Mouth Food Jar, then it will keep the food hot all day (I have this one as well). I bought this Heatkeeper because of the size & design that works well for me. Even though the Heatkeeper says it's microwavable-proof, I don't heat this in the microwave just to avoid wear & tear of the Heatkeeper (I do this with all of my plastic containers). I prefer to transfer the contents of my food (e.g. soup or broth to heat up for soup) into a ""glass"" bowl container when heated in microwave. Other than that, this Chinese-made Stanley Heatkeeper has worked well for me. It probably depends on the store you buy this at too. I don't want to go thru the trouble ordering a U.S.-made on Ebay, that's nonsense --just for the sake of this ""plastic"" Heatkeeper."
4,very durable!,"great job maintaining desired temperature, dropped a few times - no damage at all....including utensil is a bit awkward."
3,A world of average trance,"There is no single compelling reason to buy this CD. There is nothing special and the mix is al the same. For real trance, get a tunnel trance force compilation/mix. As for World of Trance...vicious vic is unsatisfactory to listen too. There are about 2 songs I like on the whole cd but they aren't worth it to buy this whole cd. Don't spend more than 6 dollars on this. This is a case of quantity vs. quality...definitley not quality for this CD."
3,For Didion fans only,"Perhaps Didion has done as much as she can with her distinctive prose style, maybe she has gotten a little bored with it, and should have attempted something different. The protagonist is very familiar, as is her ""almost"" lover, and the narrator. The result is a book I can only recommend for those who have loved her previous novels - I fit in that category. It helps that the plot is actually pretty good. And whenever I am reluctant to let something go, I will remember Treat Morrison commenting ""I mean you could add it up, but where does it get you"". As good as anything in ""Casablanca""."
2,The Last Thing He Wanted,"This book was absolutely not good! It never made any sense and skipped around that by the time it got back to a certain person, you had already forgotten who they were and why they were significant! I just read a review and they said it was a romeo and juliet book, i had no idea the main character was even in love, much less there was a second main character! If you have nothing to do for days, and time to write down every character and their significance, read this book, otherwise, really don't waste your time!"
1,Irritating story telling.,I like this writer but I didn't like this book. I found her voice/method of telling the story very irritating and hard to follow. It is probably a good story but not told well. It might be a good movie.
2,CLASSIC PLASTIC,"Gershwin CD is strangely lacking in atmosphere and reference, with over an hour of Gershwin's more classical side, including Michael Tilson Thomas conducting The Columbia Jazz Band's ""Rhapsody in Blue"", featuring Gershwin's original 1925 piano roll, Leonard Bernstein conducting The New York Philharmonic's ""An American in Paris"", and composer John Williams on guitar in ""A Foggy Day"". With song titles like, ""Medly From The Woody Allen Film 'Manhatten"", at just over three minutes, and ""Medly From 'Porgy and Bess'"", the CD is a classy cash cow thrown together by CBS Records. Tilson Thomas' ""Three Preludes for Piano"", stops and takes a dramatic musical breath in the context of these slam-bang offerings. Truly bland CD liner notes by Bobby Finn and Kay Swift, whoever they may be."
3,Lots of nostalgia but poor quality recording,"Bought it for my mom. She loves the toons (She was maried in ""41). Maria Elena was mom and dad's song. Unfortunately the quality is poor."
5,very pleased,"I was named after the song ""Dolores"" and was looking for this song for many years, pouring through 45's at garage sales, etc. My dad gave me the 45 when I was in high school over 40 years ago, and I lost track of it over time. Now I can enjoy it again and share it with my children. Thank you for offering this great CD! By the way, it arrived quickly in excellent condition."
5,Cuddliest plush toy,"I have a tradition (long story) of always giving a baby duck plush toy as a gift to newborns. I've purchased many cute ones over the years, but this isn't just cute, it is so soft and purely huggable, even the adults can't keep their hands off. I gave one to a friend's youngest daughter for her new little girl. Her also pregnant sister fell in love with it, so a month later I made sure her new infant son also had one of these adorable little ducks in his crib. Yes, they're too young yet to be holding toys, but when they're ready they won't want to resist hugging these wonderful baby ducks. Although different, my six year old grandson still sleeps with the duck which I had waiting for him in his crib when he came home from the hospital; his first toy. I only wish I'd found this duck for him. So soft you may buy two, one for yourself :))"
2,Dont watch if you need closure,"This is not your typical good guy/bad guy archetypal theme. The ""good guys"" get creamed, big time. The whole series gave me the willies."
4,"Great visuals, plot and unexpectedly good",I'm a 30 year old female and I'm not that into sci-fi really but I have to say this series is REALLY good! It's unrealistic and they leave a lot of details out that would usually occur if aliens really did arrive here but overall its a really good story and makes up for the silliness of their actions sometimes.
1,"Had pre-ordered, but then cancelled after ABC cancalled the series","There aren't many good scifi shows and movies that are aired on TV these days. ""V"" was one of the good ones. The SyFy channel airs lousy ""B"" rated cgi movies and shows about 80% of the time. Only good shows that are aired now are Eureka, Warehouse 13, Haven and if I don't fall asleep, Alphas. When ABC cancelled ""V"", I cancelled my pre-order of the 2 season of ""V"". Not to protest ABC decision to cancelled this great show, but I don't like buying something that will not have a good ending. In my opinion, ""V"" did not have and will not have a good ending. I bought the entire series of ""Lost"" because it was a great show and it had a good ending which was planned long before the finale.So here's a message for the yahoos at ABC. Shame on you.So go ahead guys, click on the option, ""No"" when asked was this review helpful. I don't care what you think. I'm glad I gave my two cents to those yahoos at ABC really stink!"
5,AWESOME SERIES...,"This is the only review I've ever written online. The series and and staff/actors were so great as well as the story line. I bought season 1 hoping to support this show. I will not buy the 2nd season as the jerks at ABC cancelled such a great show! ABC seems to only understand things that hit their ""wallets"". I urge anyone not to buy this show...ABC deserves nothing after such a great show with a great ending got cancelled!!! I hope people think twice about helping ABC as they warrant no merit for letting down so many awesome fans! If I could erase ABC from my cable box I would !!! It's not the first time they have done something so stupid with great shows, so maybe they will learn if no one buys the show."
1,Looks like the V-isitors won.,"And had the show canceled so we wouldn't find out till it was too late. Another great show going somewhere, ending nowhere."
2,"Review ""V"" Second Season","In a review of ""V"" the rerun, second time around I was not impressed. The first one back in the 80's was much better, The acting in the second run was poor. They brought Jane Badler back to play Diana again and her character failed. Reruns on any series usually fail, I was not impressed with this one."
5,Great Story love this show,"This is a great show and I am really sorry I will never know how it ends so sad, but not like the first show that ended with the half V / half human child being the peace child and the war ended because of this child and the V's left and went home and peace was back on earth now this show is really alot different than the 80's show that came out on TV this show has way more special effects more up to date with the time era of today and the day and age this story is way more modern and it really is a good show just wish they could of made a ending to the show! Just Caprica and V got cut short of how the show ends when they cancel the shows like they did and who made this happen to these show I would sure like to know so I could beg them to aleast finish the show with some sort of ending not leave it wide open and not know how the story ends. They really need alot of complaints to get the show back on the air for a ending so it is not left with no ending."
3,no audio sony dvd recorder,Story line is okay My only compliant is that there is no audio on our Sony DVD Recorder neither thru the tV nor thru SOUND system.most dvd work fine either way. I assume it is encoded some weird sick way when recording
1,Great show - no ending - don't buy it!,"This is a fantastic show, stunning and exceptional SciFi ... that said, it has a major cliffhanger due to ABC canceling the series instead of giving it a third season finale arc. Unless you like a book with no ending, don't waste your money or time, you will be left wanting and likely will never get a finale. If another network buys it from Warner Brothers and continues it with a proper envtual finale - then by all means buy it, it is fantastic. If not, save your money for a show with a conclusion - in others words, wait and see - don't fall for this money grab without a guarantee of a conclusion. If a conclusion is made, I would rate this at 5 stars."
4,The Second Coming,The second season is far better than the first season. I learned that Anna is the daughter of Diana from the original V. Most of the main characters are killed in this season. I hope they make a third season.
1,Wrong country code,I when online at Amazon.co.uk (European site) very specifict as I wanted to buy a DVD series for EU standard. I did. I bought V: The Complete Season II. Big was my surprice that it came as a region 1 > US. No where on the site nor at the purchasing processing was Region 1 mentioned - (!) not cool
2,Reboot Started Strong,"And lost it's way from Show Runner changes and less than soap opera writing. The show had no sense of direction and while plot points were made, there was no follow through. Add an over zealous, but creative, fx company, TIIC at both ABC and Warners, mix in some greed and the fans lose out again.There's one or two good eps in this Season, surely not worth more than a dollar.Maybe if ABC was smart enough, they should of picked Kenny's V-TNG. V is his baby, let him finish the story. Instead they hire script writers and the show is plagued with micro management.All of this spells a disaster for any show.It's not that people have run out of ideas, the networks and studios don't want to pay for new ideas, just keep trying to make money off rehashing old shows or movies.People need to stop buying, watching warmed over crap."
4,Just as good as Season 1,"This season is just as good as season 1 and really adds a lot more details into whats happening. The only problem is, you keep hoping for a few human victories, but even the ones people get seem to be small compared to the V victories. Really keeps you wanting to watch more to see where it leads."
1,Refuse top finance ABC,"Season 2 ends with a huge cliff hanger that is an absolute embarrassment to ABC and it's writers. There is no season 3, the show was cancelled. They royally screwed us over, and please do not give them your money. Please don't buy this horrible show of respect to loyal fans of a once great franchise."
1,SAD,An absolute joke and insult to the original. I can't believe it made it to a second season. The acting and the ridiculous attempt at special f/x make me wonder how anyone can stamp their name to this catastrophe.
1,He advocates the killing of gays,"In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a gay.When asked to apologize and change his ways he wrote a song about how hewould not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Blacks or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. Please don't support him bypurchasing his music."
3,Does Not Work For Heavy Cords (like Power Bars),"These are fine for standard, thin power cords. We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying. But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars. We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there. My advice? Invest in duct tape."
2,OKAY but not great,It can only fit small cords and regular plugs so if you have a power strip or a larger plug - it does not work.
5,Great product,Great product. My electrical outlets are now secure giving piece of mind knowing my little explorer will not get himself in big trouble.
4,Handy little Safety cover that's a snap to install!,Well worth the price! Easy as can be to install- just don't forget to keep the original outlet screw someplace you will NOT forget because you'll need it once the safety cover is no longer needed. I would have rated this a 5 star item except for the fact that it only works with normal plugs and not adapters. I should have known that from the photo... but that being said- this item is well worth the price. :D
2,They're okay once you pry them apart to install.,"These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them. My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing. I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart. Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off. Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture. It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in. I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up."
2,Only for standard plugs with thin cords,This cover only works for standard size plugs with thin cords. I could not find the size anywhere in the description. If I was covering a small plug this cover would be great but I was trying to cover a large 3 prong cord. There is not enough room in the cover for the plug to fit.
4,Great way to secure plugs in use,"This is a great way to secure plugs that are in use. Nothing is accessible to a child. The covers are very stiff at first, and very frustrating to open, but they loosen up a bit and become easy to open, but still secure."
4,Does what it should!,"It definitely keeps the kids from unplugging the lamps but I cannot get this thing open in less than a minute. There's no way my husband can work it, for sure. In another review, someone said that with a little work, I can figure out how to ""pop"" it off but I'm not there yet. It works well for outlets that you don't use for everyday things (vacuum, computer cords, etc) but areas that you always are in use for electronics and lamps."
2,waste,I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.
5,Does its job perfectly.,"The other reviewers are correct about this being a difficult item to work with but I think that's the idea. We have a baby girl who's just beginning to crawl and a huge dog that's all over the place a little much sometimes. There are some outlets in our great room very near the floor that we have several lamps plugged in to. The dog has always removed the plugs when she runs by and the baby has been eerily drawn to them.I installed this item on each outlet and am confident that those plugs are staying put and won't be accessed by any tiny hands, no matter how they try. In fact, we had a babysitter over who wanted to plug in her laptop and she said it took her 20 minutes to get a cover off.So, is this something I would use on outlets that are being used from time to time? Probably not, but I'm using them all over the house for outlets that rarely see changes to what's plugged in to them."
5,"Very good buy, easy install","I have 18 month old twins, and an older child with cerebral palsey, she has a hospital bed downstairs where we all get together during the day and evening and the babies are always getting into the cords, pulling them out of the wall, came on amazon (found this) and it goes over even the thick cords for the hospital bed (3 prong) so it is well worth the money as the babies have now completely given up on the cords :)"
2,Buyer Beware-Requires center screw for installation,"I thought these would be great, but they only install over the outlets via the center screw. Our house has all ""Decora"" outlets which don't have a center screw. It would have been perfectly simple for the company to add top and bottom screw holes so we could use these. Please check your outlets before ordering!"
4,works but only for semi-permanant installations,"This is a great CHEAP way to cover outlets+cords (must be normal lamp plugs only, NO adapters or oversized plugs (even heavy extension cords). Installation was easy, but I only used these on cords/outlets that are generally left alone. They are very very VERY hard to remove, and if you put one where you need to occasionally plug in the vaccum or a fan, you WILL be sorry. If you keep this in mind though these are perfect. For other installations go with the Safety 1st adapter & plug cover or a plain outlet solution."
3,Baby definitely will not get to your plugs!,"We have trouble opening this thing - there's no way our 15 month old son will ever get into the plugs! Because they're so difficult to open, I would not put these on any outlets that you use frequently. It's best for outlets that you plug something into that you never wish to unplug (we use one for our printer & scanner which stay plugged in all the time and one on the outlets for our lamps)."
1,Cover came off too easy,"Cover comes off way too easily, you barely have to pull. I took them back right away and got these instead, they work much better:http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-48301-Adapter-Cover/dp/B00005U8T7/ref=sr_1_10?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1290643518&sr;=1-10"
4,"Work well, need to modify to accomodate thick cords","This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes. If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit. I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them. I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away."
5,The best sock sorters,"I've tried five kinds of sock sorters and these are the best. They have a good grip and they last for years. There's another kind that looks like eyeglasses -- two linked grippers and you put a sock in each one. Those lost socks every single time I put them through the wash. By contrast, these Sock Tuckers have never lost a single sock. And boy, they're sure better than sorting laboriously through the socks and matching them all up each time you do a wash. I love 'em."
2,Weak at best,"These sock holders don't work very well. I have had much worse ones, but about a third of the sock holders fall off going through both the washer and dryer."
1,Don't waste your money buy rechargeable batteries instead,We purchased this close to christmas so we could have it always ready and charged for our son who just loves the vsmile. Thing is it quit working after 4 months. And they don't have a warranty since it is discontinued item. What a waste and I paid more than $14. Great idea but they should come out with something better. That is probably why it is discontinued. But now we have 2 vsmile and just use a good rechargeable battery
1,does NOT work in the cybor pocket version,I made the mistake of thinking this was going to work in my two children's VTech Cybor pocket games. When will they come up with a version for ours? we go through LOTS of batteries. Gets costly to the parents. The directions instruct NOT to use rechargeable batteries. Why?
1,no luck,This product does not work on the v smile pocket that it advertises for I bought three and my children have not been able to use them. Very disappointed. It is suppose to work on all v smile pocket and it only works on the ones with the blue buttons if yours has orange buttons like mine then you are out of luck.
3,Great when you can get it to work,"My son got the v-smile pocket for Christmas. He loves playing with it. We were going through batteries every 2 days. I bought the pocket charger and it works great. There is one problem with it. You really have to play around with it to get it to charge. Once it's charging, you're all set and the charge lasts a long time. It's better than putting batteries in every couple of days. I just thought buyers would want to be aware that I found this to be a problem and I did see the same complaint in other reviews. Vtech is a great company. I wish they would've tested this one further."
4,"If it doesn't work correctly, send it back immediately!!","I purchased this for my son for Christmas. It was a bit annoying trying to get the vsmile to charge correctly. Worked fine for a while then I got tired of trying to get the vsmile placed ""just right"" so it would charge. I finally contacted vsmile and was sent a return letter. You need this for return tracking. No problem once I found the number to call to report my problem. I paid postage to resend it, bummer but in the end worth it. I receieved a new product within 2 weeks and it works SO MUCH BETTER. No special adjustments for this one. I do hope vsmile takes notice and fixes this bug. If your system is not working right, contact Vtech and send it back! My kid LOVES this! I like it better than leapster."
2,Unbelievable!,"How can you sell a product that has to be constantly manipulated to work?! There should be instructions on how to work a product that should be as easy as plugging it in. I thought the product was damaged during shipment. Glad I read the reviews on how to work it, before going through the trouble of returning it."
3,"It's better than batteries, but unlike them,.... tricky","I bought a charger for my son since he was getting a vsmile pocket for Christmas. I knew that electronics use a lot of batteries so I thought this was a great idea..Well, I have not been as satisfied as I thought I would be. I had to send the first charger back because after using it once I could not get the light to come on and I could not get it to charge. After getting my replacement today it too seems finicky also. It did charge suprisingly though the light flickered very quickly and went off and no light came on 2-3 hours later to show me it had charged the vsmile pocket...I guess it is hit and miss but if it charges I am still saving on bateries since the charger was only $24 It's your call on this one!"
2,READ,You need to be careful and make sure that it will work on your device because it doesn't work on all V Smile Pocket devices. It seems only the older models work for this charger pack with the blue buttons not orange on the sides. It did not state this anywhere it just said for V smile pocket devices. The battery pack would not fit in the device so I am disappointed. If I would have known I would have checked better but as the saying goes Buyer Beware.
1,Don't buy,Says it is fully charged when it isn't and can only play for about 30 mins then you have to charge again. Waste of money and patience dealing with a child trying to play this.
4,Batteries are better,You have to be very careful putting the v-smile pocket on it and even if you do it might lose connection when you're not looking. It lasted a year and a half (not bad) and now we're back to batteries. We've found that the lithium batteries last just as long as the charge for this product so we've invested in rechargable batteries and are much happier.
1,"Great idea, Terrible product, even worse customer service.","Like many others, I bought this thinking I would save on batteries, but my son's v-smile pocket will not sit on the recharger correctly, it tips backwards and loses contact. The only way I can get it to work is to hold it for 2-3 hours - yeah right!!!, or stack several heavy objects on the edge of it and hope it works.I have been battling with V-Tech for 3 months, and have been promised a replacement twice, and finally got a letter instructing me to mail the product back to them and they would send me a replacement. No offer to reimburse for postage! No apology for the hassles! No apology for the inconvenience! And, they informed me that if my warranty had expired in the meantime, I would have to pay for the replacement! Can you believe it??? Save your money and aggravation - invest in the other similar game systems out there (ie Leapster), my friends did, and have been nothing but happy!"
1,What is it about vSmile power products?,"This no longer works (battery or dock who knows)The in car power adapter was dead on arrival andwe are on our second powerpack for the original full size vSmile.The vSmile itself and the pocket vSmile is a great product, but I so often need to run them on batteries because the power supply has packed up. Sort out the QA on the power parts please."
3,Its Ok,"Worked fine for awhile, but now it won't hold a charge at all. Might just be the battery or the charger is broken, don't know for sure. Back to using 4-AA's each time."
1,It Doesn't Charge,I am so disappointed with this purchase. I was hoping to save money on batteries. When the v smile is placed on the dock it is too heavy to connect it. I had to use duck tape to get it to charge and that was only when it was in the right spot. I do not recommend this to anyone. Save your money and purchase batteries with it.
4,A pleasure to read and experience,"Very good book. The topic is travel and far-off places, but the journey and connections with common (and not-so-common people) is the heart of the book. Joy, sadness, and a great appreciation of the human experience are all found within the pages. You will find yourself wanting to let go of your possessions and pack a bag for far off places."
1,Don't buy this!,"Just out of the box, I tried to adjust the eye-piece to my eyes. I tried the right one, they kept bending in the middle. I guess one cannot help that, but it was annoying. I tried the left eye. The knob would not even turn. I tried a little harder, and the eye-piece came off, and some sticky white stuff came out of it. I guess that made it lose its waterproofability.It gets even better. I called Amazon,to get a return authorization to return the the bad product. They refused to take their product back.I can order damaged or faulty stuff from China and sell them on amazon w/o being responsible for anything. Isn't that nice?That was the last thing I will ever buy hfrom Amazon. Unless they treat me right and get their nogood product back."
3,Kaleidoscope,"Chapters grouped by genre or theme rather than by culture group. Nonfiction in ""Arts,"" ""Ceremonies and Celebrations,"" ""People to Know"" and ""Places to Go"" are some the themes the books centers on. A valuable resource if you need to know about ways to use multicultural literature in the classroom. Fiction areas are divided mainly by grade level."
1,"Same old stuff, regurgitated and with new cover/title","Just go and read the reviews of Goldberg's other garbage. If you consider managing ""Nirvana"" a credential making you an expert on American culture, then this is for you. But then, if you think that, you probably don't read. Catch-22 (that's a book, BTW, and a very good one). Don't bother with this tripe, it's just more Danny showing off how In Touch HE is with the youth of today and how YOU aren't. If there ever was a book written purely for egotistical reasons or to pump up one's own resume/career, this is it."
1,This is the same idiot,who (as CEO of Air America Radio) cancelled the best show in radio today (Morning Sedition) because he didn't get the jokes. A total moron.
5,lush and mellow,"at sixty five, i still struggle to find unique expressions of listenable and lyrical music and this is one of them, hopefully to be idealistic with another offering to keep the uniqueness. all too often the honesty and pith of a first compilation disappears in the rat race to become famous. this album is the real thing, and if you seed a pandora station with 'needle' you will find a lot of great honest music in the same vain that you can find on amazon. one of my favorites that came up tonite is 'robinella'."
2,You get what you pay for,"This ""movie"" is in actuality an episode of the TV series ""Sara"".It is one of my favorite series of all time. It concerns an idealistic schoolteacher who wants to tame the Wild West. The production value of this DVD, does not due justice to the show. After watching the DVD, one gets the feeling this movie was transfered straight from VHS to DVD, and they used a tired VHS at that. Throughout a majority of the DVD, I could hear another program, as if the DVD had ""taped"" over another program leaving some sound residue. This distracted me greatly from fully enjoying the film. However for diehard ""Sara"" fans, this will be about the only way they will see there show. The price of the DVD is ""reasonably priced"". You get what you pay for."
5,Territorial Men DVD,"I used to watch the TV series Sarah when I was young and was excited to get this DVD. It was new in box, arrived quickly. Now if I can only find Territorial Women to go with it!"
3,Not very detailed...,"This book is okay. It does not provide much detail. It seems to try to cover many topics on few pages. In reading the overview, it appeared that there would be great details on framing walls and rooms. I also believed that it would great detail on hanging sheetrock. The book only covers these topics briefly.I was disappointed."
3,A mildly tasty treat,"Mystery readers who are sticklers for plot will find this a bit thin--oh, more than a bit thin. There is a murder and a murderer, to be sure, but the tracking down of the latter is hit and miss. The atmosphere is no different from the author's other books in this series, an inn in Amish country. As always, the characters are good. But what one reads this series for is the humor. It is here, but much of it is right out of the previous and ensuing volumes, take your pick. If the reader doesn't read the Hernia (sic) books too close together, the wisecracks will amuse. At least a year should be allowed between these or the reader will get the impression that this is a rerun."
3,"No Spice in ""...Wary""","I love this edible mystery series. But I must say that ""...Wary"" left me weary. I found much of the narrative to be repeated from other books in the series. The characters were for the most part uninteresting, and the plot line a bit thin. Ms. Myers was not up to her usual standards on this one. Buy it? Yes! How can we miss out on one, even if it's a little undercooked?"
2,amazingly repetitive,"Mystery line is okay but certainly am getting tired of so-o much repetition in every book. If reading a series from the beginning what is the need for constantly repeating the history of the family (parents' accident; mother's turning in grave causing earth tremblings and quake (this is utterly ridiculous!); sister's misbehavior; etc, etc, etc). Perhaps it is to take up space and therefore make the current story line shorter and easier to write? Does the author think that everyone has a short term memory problem and/or is not very intelligent?!! This is just about ruining the series for me. Otherwise it would be mildly entertaining and vaguely informative regarding Amish and Mennonite lifestyles. If not reading a series from the get-go then it is up to the reader to figure out some of the past history and preferably start at the beginning. So the lesson of this series seems to be Repeat-Repeat-Repeat!"
1,Buy the VHS version for now.,"I bought this at a 99 store and it was a total waste, since I already have it on VHS, and Family home entertainment made their VHS copy from a much better print. This has a lot of missing shots, terrible sound, murky color, green scratches down the entire picture, and I couldn't bring myself to give the rest of the dic a try. VHS has never looked so good as when I did a direct comparison to my VHS copy. I'm not sure FHE is still around, but their VHS edition was as beautiful as VHS comes, and, though competently authored with minimal artifacting, this source material makes it unacceptable. Some of this might actually be deliberate, since all the voice credits were deleted."
5,Wonderful old dream,Fantastic old cartoon.A great example of japan cartoon.Great color and great story. The music is very beautiful.I recommend this movie to all collectors and lovers of animation
2,Both Editions of this Film,"The print itself is in terrible condition and there is no opening menu on the DVD. I would not recommend either the Digiview or the East/West versions. The English edition is missing the first five minutes of the film, which omits a major point of the story. It's too bad, since this is a classic Japanese animated film. Look for the Italian version instead, at least it's a better print and the full movie.They also identified the character Mimi as a cat, but if you look closely, Mimi is actually a lesser panda."
4,Great Value for a Classic,This is considered to be the first color animated movie to come out of Japan. It is a great kids film and a classic.
1,Shipping Problems??,"Had ordered 2 of these ankle braces, on the 16th December 2010, but only 1 has been delivered. The other one has not been delivered yet, and no response from the seller or amazon when i emailed them regarding to this item. Item is still in stock according to the latest status."
2,A Good $1 Rental.,"The animation is good enough to enjoy, but it is not top-of-the-line. It's weakness is a weak and uneven story and poor dialog. The characters just do not add up to the story. They seem to be isolated, but together. Anyway, the story has a message about extinction and plenty of chases. It is good for family viewing."
3,Good,"The movie was nice, but story a little bit borrowing.Why I got a DVD black box instead of blueray blue box?"
1,The missing lynx bluray is not working.,"The missing lynx bluray is not working, dont know exactly whats the problem. The advertisements in the dvd are working and not playing the film itself and showing. I am out of country and hence didnt get a chance to return it back."
3,Passable Family Entertainment But Not Great,"The family watched The Missing Lynx tonight and overall it was only pretty good. The story is about a group of animals being sought by a sinister hunter working for a mysterious boss collecting pairs of animals for his nefarious plans. The animation wasn't very smooth and the overall artistic quality certainly isn't as rich as Pixar or Disney offerings (not surprising given the film's origins from a smaller Spanish studio), but the characters were cute and overall the film is likable. The dialogue and writing weren't strong and the unfolding of the narrative was a bit clumsy, especially early on. My 5 year old son enjoyed the movie just fine but it wasn't nearly as entertaining for dad as recent releases like Despicable Me or Toy Story 3. A passable flick for the kids to enjoy and worth a rental, but not one we're likely to re-visit often."
3,Something lost in the translation,"I think the original dialog for this movie may have been in Spanish and lost something in the English translation. This movie would be a good example of what-not-to-do when creating multi-lingual audio tracks. Idioms must be specific to the spoken language of the target audience otherwise the dialog comes out flat...if that makes sense. It sounds as if Antonio Banderas himself (no offense) had translated the Spanish dialog to English and it did not work as well as it could have. I have noticed this in some other movies with multi-lingual or dubbed audio tracks. Otherwise, it has a good story, good video and audio quality."
5,excelent,"excelent, fast delivery ,very happy with the purchased and the experience. great value and saved money. will recommended to my friends"
2,"Flimsy fabric, skimpy cut","I have worn Hanes undies and found them to be satisfactory for years, but this style was a disappointment for two reasons. First, the fabric is flimsy. The main advantage of cotton undies is that they wick perspiration away from the body. This style fails to do an adequate job. Second, the cut is skimpy. I have worn the same size undies for many years, consistently across two brands and several styles. This style fails to cover the subject adequately."
5,Exceedingly well pleased!,"These are cute as heck and in a really nice light weight, perfect summer panties under light clothing - feel like there's nothing there. The quality has NOT gone down, these are just great."
4,They are the Best,"As I was looking at products like this, this was one of the only brands that sells in a multi-pack. They are comfortable and economic."
1,Made in Viet Nam,"Just received. Haven't washed or worn them yet. Noticed that they are made in Viet Nam. You may not care about that. If the slaughter of 50,000 American boys, and the loss of a war that was already won, mean nothing to you - then these may be OK. It was a long time ago. For me, until they return the bodies of the MIA's, I won't do business with Communists and their slaves."
3,Good vs evil.....again.,"With a mythological bent, this story could be considered just a different twist on 'The Omen'. Though I have read better 'anti-Christ' stories, this one was less of a cliche. It was refreshing in that the 'Evil One' was not an American!"
1,Very cheap product,"Arrived damaged.... Missing perch/port..Otherwise made of cheap, thin plastic..Need short stainless screw to hold base together.Plastic tabs designed to hold everything together would fail after filling with seed.Do not recommend."
2,"Barely ""you get what you pay for.""","The tube in this feeder is barely strong enough to be compared to a disposable water bottle.The green plastic is shoddy and is clearly going to be temporary.This feeder is not going to enhance anyone's garden, and will have a very brief life."
1,Cheap Materials,"The feeder is extremelly cheaply made, is all plastic, and falls apart easily. Just the weight of a squirrel sitting on it, will cause the bottom tray to start coming apart from the feeder. In less then a week, the squirrels had completly destroyed this feeder, and it will no longer hold seed.Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Do not buy this feeder,I've had this feeder for about 2 months. The tube is thin plastic and 1 of the ports would not stay in the feeder and resulted in a seed spill. Look elsewhere for better construction. I'm just glad it wasn't that expensive.
2,Poor design with material used,"The bottom saucer is held on to the tube with 2 'bump-out' tabs you activate from inside. They are TOO SMALL and do not bump out and hold the saucer on the bottom of the tube, and without a separate bottom to the tube, all the seeds spill out (and the saucer falls to the ground). I have wired the saucer to the tube in a manner I can undo (to wash) but if the darn bump outs were a little bigger, this would not be a problem. VERY POOR DESIGN (the bump-out tabs; the rest is fine).I would neither recommend nor purchase again."
3,If it rains...,"The finches seem to like it fine when it's dry. Advice would be find a bird feeder with a hood to limit the rain exposure. I left it outside once when it rained, a couple of days later there was yellow mold all over the feeder. I had to dump all the seed, wash it thoroughly, and then it was good to go. I just can't bring it inside every time it rains."
3,Birds Love this One ... but ...,"Not sturdy enough. I go through one of these every 2-3 months. Large birds like Cardinals, Dove & Jays are too heavy for this and eventually break the bottom off. They prefer the tray which is why I bought this model and it works well for about 2-3 months, but the tabs that hold the bottom off ALWAYS breakdown. I'm trying other ""tray"" models. Cheap and great if you don't have ""heavy"" birds or squirrels to deal with. Definitely attracts a lot of birds, just doesn't last long."
1,Lasted One Week,"I had never had a bird feeder before, so I purchased this one to test it out.It lasted about a week. Squirrels got on to it and ate through the plastic tube that holds the feed.If you have a way to suspend this feeder that is ""squirrel proof"" it is a good alternative. Otherwise, you may want to consider something else.I've included a picture on the product page that may be helpful."
3,Works fine...but with same issues reported earlier,"I have had the headset for 2 months now. It works well; sound is as clear as directly on the fone, but I have the same complaint that ppl have noted in earlier reviews - person on the other end cant hear me clearly sometimes. And no, its not coz the either me or the other person has poor signal. Though I want to point out that its not the case all the time, but nevertheless its there. Once you get used to it, picking up calls directly from the headset is not a problem - it takes upto 5 sec. to get connected, so one ought to press the button early else call might be missed.I read reviews for other bluetooth headsets in the same price range as well before buying...all (incl this one) have some issue or the other, so its a matter of what you want more and what you dont.I am satisfied with what I got."
2,Jabra BT110 too hard for others to hear,I was very hopefull that this handsfree wireless headset would solve my problems. I have a IPAQ 6340 so I don't really want to place the screen up to my face and the plug in wire headset microphone provided was a little tedious . . . But I found that my callers could hear mostly background noise and not really hear me that well . . .the microphone needs to be much closer to my mouth than was possible . . . but I wasn't willing to buy a higher end model. . the other thing is the pairing process was very finicky and I repeated it several times when I was unable to answer a call etc. When I was doing the same thing sometimes it would work & sometimes not. I had to reset my PDA several times in the process.
3,Not great..my Palm 650 need to be out of the cover to have clear voice,Used this for past 10 days and people are complaining about my voice - I stick my palm one 650 on my belt -Other end can not hear me properly when I'm using this head set. Works well where no air blowing around - something like in the house or in your car. You can not use on the bus as you need to talk low - other end can not hear you..Just be careful where you use it - Start feeling heavy in about 15 mins on the ear...(so I change from right to left ear or vice versa...)
3,Not bad for the price,"It connected with my Razor V3 with no issues, very simple to use. Compared to some others it is a little heavy due to the AAA battery, but it fits my ear perfect and comfortable. I hear everyone perfect and they hear me good also. The distance is not all that great but the 15hr talk time and $30-$40 price tag make up for its flaws. If you're looking for a good and inexpensive Bluetooth headset I recommend it."
2,Do not use with Motorola V3 Razer!!,"I bought this item to be used with my Razer phone but it takes too much time to connect and end up missing a call.I tried it with some other manufacture's cell phone and it works okay.Do not use it with Razer, you are going to be sorry."
2,Make sure it works with your phone,"Two things--I don't think it is that comfortable--I wear glasses, and it would keep sliding off my ear.More importantly, though, it didn't work with my phone, despite its support for bluetooth 1.2. Make sure your phone is on the list of approved phones, and don't even think of using it with a non-phone bluetooth device (even if it supports bluetooth headsets).After my one brief flirtation with bluetooth I am quite disappointed. What is the point if the devices are not easily interchangeable? On the other hand, I was happy with Amazon's quick refund of my money."
1,Bulky. Not easy to wear,The product is bulky as you carry the AAA battery behind your ear. This has been mentioned before the product is bought. But the reality hit me after I bought the product.The main issue is it is very difficult to wear. I am unable to get it fit in my ear. Tried a lot of ways but in vain...
2,Jabra BT110...,"When it works, it works well, but I'm constantly getting warnings on my phone about a weak signal even when the phone is right next to the headset. The Jabra BT110 is comfortable despite having a triple-A battery inside, and the many ear inserts make it very easy to get comfortable. I just wish I could have a complete conversation without losing the headset."
1,Simply not good,"Using with a Treo 650... Popcorn sounds in the background, couldn't have the phone more than 12 inches away from the unit or it would disconnect or just sound horrible. Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas! You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!"
2,"Book should be renamed, ""Commercial Staircases""","I bought this book, hoping to find pictures of residential staircases, from old and new houses. Instead, I was disappointed to find the book had only commercial staircases. While some of the staircases are quite intriguing, such as a glass staircase, the author should have named the book, ""Commercial Staircases"" or had a line on the cover which described the true contents of the book. so, buyer beware: buy this book only if your interest is in the commercial application of staircases.!"
5,"Thorough presentation, setting the record straight","This is a much welcome addition to the recent spate of books published about the Karmapa Issue, thoroughly researched and very informative. Curren gives a chance for Shamar Rinpoche to tell his side of the story and invites readers to draw their own conclusions.Curren also introduces new material which has not been mentioned elsewhere, including the involvement of the Taiwanese in the politics of the Karmapa recognition. He also presents valuable information from research done by the Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu which indicates that Orgyen Trinley's 'escape' from Tibet was something very different to the official version which appeared in the world media.This book will hopefully provide a counterweight to Lea Terhune's and Mick Brown's recent books on this subject, and begin to set the record straight on the Karmapa issue."
5,no need for truth ....,"The Karmapa issue is something to remind us (Buddhist) that enlightenment is the ONLY purpose of all our prayers and desires.To the non-Buddhist, this is as true as in all human related problems, no one is spared.As long as sentient beings continue to suffers, Buddha's not smiling ..."
5,Buddha's not smiling,"This book is a exiting book with the ornamants of Tibetan Buddhism when it is best.I took refuge with His Hollines The 16th Karmapa in 1972 and have been waitning for this book.It is a must to have book.Claus Hermansen, Denmark, buddhist in 34 years."
2,Pre-biased and non objective,"The Author's conclusion was well set prior to the publication of this book, which is merely another 100% biased propaganda piece beating the drums for Shamar Rinpoche's candidate, Thaye Dorje."
3,What can I say?,Got this for my wife's birthday party. Most folks couldn't relate to the music. Item is a good trivia item.
5,a good enough sampler of her Columbia years...,"Sarah Vaughan possesed one of the greatest voice of all time, and she was the best jazz singer of the 40s'-50's period, her vocie was rich, creamy, velvety and endlessly elegant, and stylishly devine. This cd will make you a fan, and than you can graduate to her Verve recordings, but start here, and work your way up."
2,not durable enough,I bought this for tour.the locks aren't durable enough. the handle is strong enough for any amount of gear what would fit in this unit.there are MANY better companies that make an item like this.I contacted GATOR ... they said they'd replace it ... then stopped answering my emails.I'd skip this one.
3,wrong film,The review by Mr Schultz is of Les Petroleuses made in 1971 by Christian-Jaque and Guy Casaril. Caroline and the Rebels is actually Le Fils de Caroline Chérie made in 1954 by Jean Devaivre.
4,Fun Bardot Western,"This was one of Bardot's last films, shot in the early 70's.She is full of life and throws her energy and spirit into thislightweight film. Claudia Cardinale is also in high spirits. Both have a charisma that carries the film, though the supporting cast give uneven performances. Bardot has a mature beauty in the film, with riveting eyes. The plot revolves around an Outlaw (Bardot)hiding out in a town, pretending to be a Doctor. Later, both women find out that there is oil on a property and fight over the land. The film is poorly dubbed, but much of the humor still translates into English. Bardot made two more films in '73, and then walked away from the silver screen forever. Most actresses hang on to their fame long after it has passed them by. Bardot is a class act, and used the rest of her life to help animal rights causes. She had a flair for comedy, and Frenchy King is a fun western."
1,Hand made by hackers,"The product description says:1. ""buy new"" - you get a DVD burned on a computer, with a hand made label, scratched and defective. The label on the box is printed so poorly that it is impossible to read the text.2. Format: AC-3, Color, Digital Sound, Director's Cut, DTS Surround Sound, Full Screen, Original recording remastered, Restored, Surround Sound, NTSC - you get a copy full of scratches, fuzzy with very poor sound and 9 minutes short of the ""original"" version.3. Language: French - you get a poorly dubbed English version.I'm a little shocked that Amazon would ship what is clearly a ripped DVD burned on a DVD-R disk.On the positive side, they refunded me. Good!"
4,Good Product - Works as designed,Good product...it works as designed on my mower. It is easy to install and works well. It is a good product.
4,There Is A Mountain of Snow!,"""There is a mountain of snow, up past the big glen. We have a castle enclosed. There is a fountain. Out of the fountain flows gold into a huge hand. That hand's held by a bear, who has a sick band of: goats, and cats, and pigs, and bats...with brooms and bats and wings and rats, and play big dogs like queens and kings and everyone plays drums and sings...bout big sharks, sharp swords, beast bees, bead lords, sweet cakes, mace lakes...O ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma......"" If you think the aforementioned Wham City lyrics are a bit off the beaten path, wait till you hear Snake Mistakes. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes music a bit to the left (or right depending on preference) of center. A guaranteed smile almost on every track."
3,Insanity is N the Details,"I used to think I was kinda nuts; then I heard this. It was on one of those Best of 2007 lists in a free weekly, so I took a chance and bought it. It arrived and I played it all the way through without stopping: an act of sheer will. Then I played it for my 6 yr old who promptly started cursing, spitting up blood and came at me with scissors - I turned it off. Then I recently pulled it out again to listen to, just to see if it was still unbearable and it just wore me down: I finally got it: stop making sense. Now I play it all the time, I guess that's a good thing..."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this brand new bracelet to give away FREE to my indigent patients. But I was totally disappointed and I can't even show it to them,so embarrassing. I ordered 16 pcs. all the clasp were tarnished and the edges of the plate were rough. I guess this is what we pay for cheap price."
2,Too long,"Let's just say that alhough I find Banner okay, I don't really like the woman, Tressa Loring. Kinda immature. And the flow of the story is rather long and meandering."
3,Good read,"I enjoyed Banner's Bonus - it's a good story with a logical plot, nice romance and characters to relate to.It's not a strong story, but still a good read.I'm sure the author will hone her skills in future, and I've already bought the next in the series."
1,There are better books on the subject.,Better books on the topic have been written by far more prominent people.I read it and would not recommend it.
4,Nice,Worked very well and fixed the door very completely. Installation was simple if you disregard the directions and just replace the item intuitively.
5,garage part,it was very convenient and easy to order replacement parts for our garage door. they were easy to install and the opener works fine although this was not the part needed and we did order the added part we saved a lot of money since we did not have to call a repairman.
3,Does the job,"It's the size I needed and it's glass. So, it does the job. It would have been nice if it matched my other pieces (didn't have a stainless handle or trim). Also, it would have been nice if they had told you what order you had to rearrange the handle, washers and screw to put the handle on TOP of the lid."
2,No Gift Card included,Bought as a gift and no gift card included. Also surprised that gift wrapping is not available on this type product which is normally bought as a gift.
2,Insanely expensive,"This is a really, really good collection of essays that introduce a wide variety of topics to novice readers, and I have used previous editions of the collection in a number of college courses. However, nothing about the book is good enough to justify the ridiculous price. Previous editions were nowhere near this expensive. There are many other books out there that are almost as good as this one for one quarter the price. Get one of those instead."
5,daedelus' best work,"daedelus, like the mythologic character, has created some amazing structures in the past. and this album holds up to be what i think his best work. daedelus' style is amazing! i have listened to this album at least five times start to finish and haven't tired of it. very unique"
3,"Cowboys, Indians, and Archeologists?","A massive rock shaped as a human skull and a fierce Indian tribe guard an archeological treasure-trove in a lost valley. Things start to pop when the Three Mesquiteers and an expedition of archeologists searching for the treasure and a lost colleague enter the sacred Indian territory. This film is an entertaining Grade B western that includes the familiar elements of cliff-hanging western adventure and light humor. The unusual blend of western and archeology themes gives this little movie an unusual twist that adds to its appeal. ""The Three Mesquiteers"" was a familiar series of the '30s and '40s. The three saddle pals kept changing over time, and once included John Wayne before he became a major star. Good old Saturday matinee stuff. Kill an hour an enjoy yourself."
1,Inaccurate Description,"The description says ""Contains 3 flywheel keys"", the picture shows 3 flywheel keys, there is actually 1 flywheel key. A little disappointing because I thought I would save some money by buying a few at a time, but I ended up spending more. Otherwise it was the right part just the wrong quantity."
4,"Works great, Price is good.","Bought it through Accessory Export, LLC. Arrived promptly. The shipping cost is on par with other sellers. The quality of the material is not as good as OEM, but works fine. It is a good buy at a fraction of the OEM cost."
4,"I finally ""got it""","I avoided this album for years. I finally listened to it and I ""got"" it. What a smooth, sensual and complex album. Sonically amazing, with its bagpipes, American Indian flutes, penny whistles, church bells, electronic washes and spooky lyrics. I really love it. This Woman's Work is one of the best songs ever written. This is a Kate Bush album for people who would be terrified by any of other other stuff. Mature, mellow and something that needs to be listen to as a whole album. Just let yourself absorb this album on a cold autumn night."
5,Brilliant,I like Kate - this is a good Kate..... what more can I say.If you like Kate and don;t have this - then get it....
2,only for the hardcare fans!,"Every song on the Dreaming was utterly awesome. She peaked with that album, and it went downhill from there. Hounds of Love was half brilliant and this one has 3 songs I really like (the title track, ""Never Be Mine"", ""This Woman's Work""). Aside frome these, the album ranges from uncompelling to downright lame. If this is her most ""mature,"" as others have argued, its her least interesting."
3,Not as good as the rest ofher work,"I was somewhat disappointed, because I had expected songs like from ""Hounds of Love"". But I do feel that the more I listen the more I appreciate this album. It has many slow songs, which can be very soothing and relaxing after a stressful day. I have to say that this is the kind of cd that you'd want to listen to when you have guests and need relaxed music on the backround. It is not nearly as expressive and interesting as the rest of her other albums. Over all I do enjoy it, I have to be in a certain mood, though."
4,Kate Bush CD,I received this product quickly and in good condition. I enjoy most of the songs on the CD and happy with my purchase.
1,not so sensual,"If it wasn't for the tenth track-""This Woman's Work,"" this CD would be on my top ten worst CD list. How she could tie a sensual world in with this music is beyond me...some of the lyrics are so harsh and not even worth listening to. I'm disappointed, but at least I have track 10."
3,Fine Line Between Sensuous and Incipid,"Kate Bush called this her most 'feminine' album, the point being to create sensuality through sound. In essence, 'The Sensual World' is intended to be symbolic of the romantic and sexual state experienced by women. However, as Bush could never be considered a 'normal' woman by any standard her views on the subject are not surprisingly rather jilted. Still, some very emotional and touching music is on offer here, although the soft celtic tones of this album (which is succeeding two very dynamic albums before it) makes it sound at times a little incipid.Best Tracks: Love and Anger, Reaching Out, This Woman's Work."
2,A Sensual World a bit over my head,"I love Kate Bush, I have had a couple of albums in the past and was looking to get some in my collection of CDs. Unfortunately ""A Sensual World"" didnt really gel with me, very esoteric and hard to understand and empathise with."
5,"Not her strongest, but still 5 stars","I'm an unabashed Kate Bush fanatic and think she is one of the greatest things to ever come from Great Britain. She is blessed with an amazing and unique voice, along with a distinct musical vision, and the compositional genius to back it all up.This might not be her strongest album, but it's close, and is most definitely worthy of 5 stars."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big Kate Bush fan. She has to be one of the best songwriters -- and female vocalists -- ever. But this album is the beginning of her decline and eventual disappearance from the music scene. A lot of the tracks are simply tedious. It's almost as if she's lost interest in songwriting and is cranking out a few minutes of music. (Does anyone care to defend ""Heads We're Dancing""?) Only ""The Fog"" somewhat holds my interest. This album makes me wonder what happened to Kate. What is she doing with herself now? It's as if the urge to express herself in her music has disappeared. Sigh..."
5,Her best CD,"This is one of the few CDs from the old days that I still listen to on occasion. If you enjoySo Tonight That I Might Seeand other musicians with that swirly, dreamy sound then this CD is a must have! I think it's Kate's finest work, especially vocally. Sensual World was way before it's time or maybe its the rare timeless CD. If you like Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell or Tori Amos then you must add this one to your collection. If Kate Bush is new to you and you're wondering which CD to buy, I urge you to buy this one, you can't go wrong. I have the old CD and am buying the new one since the samples here on Amazon sound so much cleaner and clearer."
1,Juast bad!,This book is one of the worst I have ever read. Most of the stories are poorly written and make little sense. Every now and then an author throws in a cheep reference to Harry Potter or Tolkien and that is as good as it gets.
5,My Berndes Square Grill LPan,This is my second Berndes Grill Pan.I used the first one for ten years. The non-stick surface on my new pan has been much improved. The pan is a dream. I love it! Hamburgers taste as though they were done on an outdoor barbecue.
3,"Sturdy, versatile, but beware moisture","I have purchased three of these for my plants. They are located on my screened porch. As far as look and function they are great, easy to assemble, easy to move around, and can hold most any weight potted plant. The 3 shelves are well spaced. The one MAJOR drawback is that the metal frame rusts. If these are exposed to rain, or high humidity they WILL rust out. You must coat the frame with a coating of rust proof paint first. Suggest to the manufacturer to treat the metal with rust proofing prior to shipping. Otherwise, they look and function great."
5,csi..,Don't know what happened....I ordered new ....my package went to someone else and the watched it and then shipped it to me....looked new....and played without any problem....ty
3,CBS/Paramount no longer cares about it's customers or quality control!!!,"This was a good season overall, but I bought this from Amazon & got a bad disc 6, constant freezing, was sent a second set after notifying Amazon, it too had the same exact problem, what were the chances?...it is clear Paramount has gotten cheap in producing these, I will not be buying Season 12, there is simply no excuse for this!!...buy at your own risk."
4,Self Debating,"The main reason why I put the episode (Fracked) on was because the girl who plays Emma the pink ranger on the new Power Rangers Megaforce season was is in it, I checked each new ranger's filmography. She is the girl who skinny dips topless with a couple of guys in the beginning. As for the episode itself, I barely ever understand the scientific stuff and though the story was good, it would have been nice to see the major bad guys get taken down. They didn't even show them. While I do find some episodes funny, some of them are just too complicated for me to understand. That is why I can only give it 4 stars."
3,This was an ok season but I find myself wanting more from this show,I still love the original CSI but it has gone down hill since Gill left and with others leaving in the future it is probably on life support.
5,My son is a huge fan!,I purchase a new CSI season every year for my son who is a law enforcement officer and a huge fan! He is always happy to receive his new season for Christmas every year and on his days off will have CSI marathons until he finishes the entire season!
4,Improve your golf swing indoors,"Having attended GMS twice this was a great refresher video. Reinforced some of the concepts learned and was an excellent reminder of the key drills like parallel hands, symmetry and the belly swing. Living in the Canada this will be good to develop muscle memory for the spring season. Looking forward to continuing the drills and the exercises...Marc may want to take some acting lessons, but that is not what this is about...simplicity is the key."
1,Big waste of money,"This is a big waste of money for me. The instructor does not look like a pro or fluent in what he is teaching, rather like a big talk person. This depressed me very much. There is no helpful tips or techniques that i can adapt."
5,Something special about this book!,"I read this to my 4 kids as babies and to my granddaughter. I will get a copy for each of them now that they are older and for grandkids. I think it's the illustrations and the simplicity of the book that babies and children like about it so much. There aren't a lot of words to it, but each reinforces what babies like and what babies do, even being naughty! Simply put, babies really can identify with the pictures and words...What baby doesn't like to be hugged and loved???One thing I think is miswritten is wher it says ""Before you know it, they will be running and chasing all around, oh, so busily, and do lots of things by themselves."" I think it should say ""doing"" lots of things, not ""do"" lots of things. But, it doesn't ruin the book or anything like that."
1,Beware - reprint missing many pages!,"This book is so dear to me. I recently bought extra copies to give as gifts. I was so dismayed to see that this reprint is missing 6 pages from the original -- including a two-page spread near the center of the book with a blue background (and featured the only African American baby -- now gone). If you loved this book as a child, don't think that buying this reprint will replace the one you had. This abbreviated reprint has been published with the same ISBN as the copy I have from 1985 -- fraud! They should have changed the ISBN to reflect the change in content. I'm not sure if the 1991 reprint had the missing pages or not. The new one sold now was printed in 2003. I'm writing a letter to the editor to ask for a complete reprint! [...]"
5,Wonderful First Book !,"This is a wonderful, multi-cultural ""first book"" for young children. I bought it for my children, and now for my grand daughter."
5,My Son LOVED This Book!,"I'd never read this book before it was given to my son as a gift when he was about one. It soon became his favorite book! He loved the pictures of the babies and the simple text that accompanied them. The overall message of the book, I thought, was lovely -- all babies like to be hugged and kissed and cuddled and loved."
5,"After 4 babies, I need a new ""Babies"" for baby #5!","This is the BEST baby book. I have it memorized after reading it to my 1st 4 children so often. I had to order a new one for Baby Henry, the original is in such bad shape! It has literally been loved to pieces. Every child will love this book, it is SO sweet!"
3,"Five stars for the art, but...","...two stars for the text. I'm not crazy about the use of the words ""naughty"" and ""bad"" in reference to babies. I know, I know, I'm one of those touchy-feely attachment parents. My fourteen-month-old does love the book, though!"
3,good!!,I receive this book very quicklyand very clean snd goodthis book very useful to meI will study very hard with this bookthank you
3,fast shipping,the book i ordered was still in good condition except the writings on it..but it was specified already in its description..so its ok
3,Starter Repair Kit Review,The new Briggs rewind tool works ok but I liked the old rewind tool they used to have but it does work and it frees your hands so you can replace the rope after the spring is rewound.
2,Something important has changed,"I'm a big fan of ""some"" of Rob Crow's music. Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, Pinback, The Ladies, Other Men and his previous solo albums. There are certain things that he does that make his style stand apart from the bregga that dominates the pop charts and radio stations, although this album seems to lack them.I'd advise any fan to listen to all the tracks before purchasing this album because if they had made all the tracks available to preview, I would have skipped this one. There's a reason they only allowed one track to be sampled, and I should have realized that even IT wasn't good enough for my tastes.Let's hope he doesn't loose the edge he once had on previous solo albums. If this is foreshadowing his style to come, then I wish him all the luck in the world."
2,S&H High and did not fit 9.5 inch crepe pan,"The lid was the quality expected from Berndes and it fits other 9.5 inch items that I have. I was hoping it would fit the crepe pan; however, it is slightly to big to fit properly. S&H was high and out of line with similar size and weight items I have purchased. I will try to limit my purchases to items sold by Amazon to make use of Amazon Prime (best deal since sliced bread)"
4,Second brain holds clues for first brain problems,"I am a neurological development consultant who has read this book thoroughly and concur with the findings from a developmental point of view. I found this book a must read for anyone who has a developmentally challenged child or adult. In working with brain disorders and brain injuries, I always look to the bowel in the course of the examination because, 'if the bowel ain't happy, the brain ain't either!' There is so much more that is not in this book about the bowel that affects the brain that it would take several volumes of books to elaborate on what is already known today. If you or a loved one suffer from psychological ailments, brain disorders, IBS, or even just common irregularities of the bowel,reading this book is an appropriate start to gain an understanding of basic biological processes of the bowel.Also recommended: Biological Treatments for Autism, Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management,"
4,the science of digestion,"This book describes the author's research into the function of the digestive system, with emphasis on the amazing complexity of its neural control, which operates largely independent of the central nervous system (and independent of our consciousness as well). The book is very thorough, taking you through the gut step by step from one end to the other. There are some abstruse technical parts, but overall the book can be followed by the layman without too much difficulty. The paperback version is a real bargain in terms of the information you get."
2,Eh.,"This book started off intriguing. The author has a sharp wit and there were a few great take-aways from the first part of the book. The rest of the book is pedantic and at the very end the author justifies killing animals for science. If I knew that was going to be the final wrap up at the end, I would have never purchased. You've been cautioned."
3,not for the layperson,"If you are someone suffering from digestive problems and looking for answers, this is not the book to read. Unless you're a scientist or familiar with the scientific process this book is all technical gobbledygook. For someone who knows science, I'm sure it's quite fascinating. For someone looking for help with a digestive disorder, this book is of little use."
3,the second brain,"I love the idea of the book, and the author is very knowledgeable. It had some very good information about how the gut's nervous system worked but it was filled with long personal stories of how he found the data which would have been of more interest if I was in his field but I was just looking for the functional information and it took far too long to wade through the book. The book had about ten pages of information that I loved spread out over hundreds of pages."
3,Not what I expected,"A well written book, but fairly technical... almost like reading a professional journal article. I was hoping for a more general discussion of the interaction between seratonin and gut reactions - such as hunger and mood - if such an interaction existed. The background information on his research associates wasn't really useful or necessary to understanding, but I guess it was a professionally curteous thing to do. It's primary usefulness to me was to let me know how extraordinarily well sensitized the gut is to its internal environment and how it manages its tasks."
4,"Compact, reliable, fine image quality, excellent overall",Well built mid range zoom for cropped sensors. Lightweight. Excellent image quality. My only complaint is that this lens doesn't have the HSM focus system.
3,BGSU,As a early 1970's student who graduated from BGSU - I found the book underwhelming to read.The book was definitely a product of the administrator's viewpoint and glossed over the student issues.
2,"Okay, there may be one thing on here that is a dealkiller","This is the first edition of PSP that has come out under the Corel banner, and I already have one HUGE problem with it. The most simple color adjustment, where you can simply change the overall amount of red, green and blue, is gone. Instead, you have to go with the MUCH more cumbersome ""Color Balance"" tool, wherein you have three sliders, one for Cyan to Red, one for Magenta to Green, and one for Yellow to Blue. The problem is that you have to make separate adjustments for each tone...shadow, midtone, or highlight. In other words, when you change the color of the midtones, you are NOT changing the shadows or highlights. That's two more steps. Sound complicated? It is, and it isn't a very easy tool to use and so far I have not gotten anywhere near the results I have been after.On the next update, Corel should put this handy feature back. Otherwise, stick with PSP 9...a great JASC product. I have a feeling I'm going to miss those guys."
5,Corel Paint Shop pro X,"This is a tremendous bargain. It is easier to use than Adobe Photoshop, but with many of the same useful features. The learning curve is a lot easier than Photoshop. It comes with many built in help aids which will walk you through different techniques. I also use Photoshop CS2 and bought this program as it is faster to use when I am in a rush. Like all good software packages, there is a learning curve. Be patient and work with it and the end result will be well worth it. This is a great stepping stone to CS2, although for most serious photographers Pro X is all you will ever need."
1,Corel's PS X is disappointing,"I have been a regular user of JASC Paintshop Pro, and this first release under Corel whetted my interest because it boasted an improved interface and supposedly runs 50% faster.This software only works under W2K and XP, those running on W98 and WmE cannot use it.The manual has shrunk to a fraction of its former size. My JASC manual is huge, Corel's whole X manual is not much bigger than Jasc's Guide so better plan on buying a Dummies book to make the best of X.I found the new interface to be confusing rather than helpful, and functional improvements over Jasc's PSP9 seem few and far between.Corel missed the mark, but Amazon has JASC's Paintshop Pro 9 on sale for $50 with Free Shipping and a $30 rebate. For $20 you get software that works on almost every PC."
2,Don't bother,"I was extremely disappointed with PSP X. I've been using PSP for a long time, but for the first time, am incredibly disappointed. PSP X lacks MANY of the features I'd come to love in PSP 8. The brower is bothersome. I liked to keep my browser open but minimized. Can't do this with PSP X. The ""one-step photo fix"" is horrible! I found myself going back to PSP 8 for photo fixing, but guess what... the files aren't downward compatible! Even tho' they are both labled *.pspimage. How annoying! PSP X has built-in effects.On the positive side, I do like the PSP X layer palette better. and there are some nice new tubes, and maybe some new frames. And ability to filter tubes, textures & patterns is nice. But these in no way make up for what you give up.The bottom line is that I'm now looking at investing in Photoshop."
1,"Dumbed down Corel Draw, Seriously crippled Paintshop Pro 9","Just finished downloading Paintshop Pro X. Corel seriously killed a versatile and handy tool. I get the impression they have tried to clone it into CorelDraw without making it too obvious.The only thing I have been able to do so far is open an image and zoom in and out. The browser is pathetic compared to the PSPro 9. One example: With the old version you could drag and drop images into various folders in the folder tree on the left. With the new version of the browser, you can, for a start not see the tree. After a lot of fiddling, the tree is now on the left. Drag and dropping of images doesn't seem to work.If you enlarge the area of the browser so that you can see a decent number of images in the browser, you loose the ability to directly open images. Oh-no, sorry I am wrong! It does open the images. Behind the browser area. So you have to close the browser to get to the images you tried to load."
2,Downhill since PSP8,"I've used PSP since it hit the market. PSP9 took forever to load and, aside from networking facilities, offered no advantage over PSP8 - I deleted it. PSP X loads faster than PSP9 but the user interfaces are drastically changed with no significant improvement - and the Browse Folder facility, which I use extensively with large volumes, is completely BROKEN. There's a ""Hide Browser"" feature that's so slow it's useless, and even with it turned off, images come up BEHIND the browser(!) Ooftah!! I'm going to delete PSP X, too."
2,WHAT HAPPENED!!!?,"I first started using PSP with version 2. I've happily used versions 3, 5, and 7 as they came out. I tried the demo of version 8, which was okay, but since version 9 was due to be released, I waited. Currently, I have version 7 and 9 on my WinXP machine. Version 9 has a few nice things to offer for photo editting that are not available in 7, but since 7 loads so much faster and is (for me) so much easier to use, I hardly ever boot up version 9. As for 10...well, I must echo the lament of several other reviewers. JASC had a great product..and Corel seems bent on turnng it into a POS that isn't much more useful than the photo software that comes with most good digital cameras. Most of what I do is graphic design related, with some photo editting..but not much. If you are really into doing creative things with digital photgraphs I think that Photoshop is the way to go, based on the amount of reference materials that are available (mainly because you need them!)"
3,Will cost additional funds to get animation shop,"I uninstalled an old version of Jasc PSP 7, and it also removed animation shop, which had been bundled in 7. I'm unsure about reinstalling it with this version, so that leaves me the option of buying animation shop at full price from Corel. :\Version X takes some getting used to. I spent hours trying to figure out the new locations for particular tool settings, and of course nothing you really need will ever be in the help file."
3,Bought it because it was free...,This program is ok. It takes a long time to load. I've used the Corel Photo Album though I rarely used Paint Shop Pro.If I had to do it again I wouldn't buy this software...I'm satisfied with the photo editors I get with my different camera purchases.
4,I like it but confused,I like the product but I am having a hard time trying to figure out some of its features. I try to go online for support but there is not much there. I know when I finally figure things out on my own I'll grow to love it.
5,How are you going to use it ?,"If all you want to do is the simple stuff,like resizing images,changing the color a bit or even add some sort of frames,there are a million free programs that do just that.If you are a photographer or a graphics designer, you better stick with Photoshop,it is hard to learn but the quality is phenomenal.But if like the most people out there, you are someplace in the middle, Paint Shop Pro is an excellent choice.It will let you use your imagination and do things you only dreamed about,the results will be nothing short of astonishing.It is easy to use,the Help file available with the program is excellent,and also there are 100's of Yahoo and MSN groups dedicated to PSP.You will not regret buying it.However,make sure that you have the computer ""Recommended"" requirements,as you are going to need them.If you do not have them,fear not ! in many places the older version: Paint Shop Pro 7 is available, and it will run perfect on older PC's."
2,Goodbye Corel,"Well, I finally got around to it: uninstalling PSP X. It was just a waste of perfectly good harddrive space. And besides, I have PSP 9 installed, which is just a better program than PSP X. I'm only sorry that I purchased the ""upgrade"" to PSP X when it was first offered by Corel, after they bought out JASC. What a waste of money. Now I hear that Corel has released PSP PHOTO XI. Yes, what was once a fine image processing software program has been relegated to being a mere photo enhancement program. No thanks, Corel!"
5,Great Photo Software,"It's the first time I've ever tried & bought something like it, and I like it very much, it really works well with photo repairs and enhancements, great program!. Remarkably easy to learn, in thirty minutes you can have the basic grasp of how-to's."
2,Slower and Crashes,"JASC paintshop pro was not bad, but sadly the move to Corel appears to have had negative affect as is so often the case when new, larger parent companies think they know better. It is slower to start, slower to use, but by far the worst problem is it crashes regularly. In a 2 hour session, maybe four or five times. I'm a graphics programmer, so I know writing this software isn't rocket science - its a case of hiring the right people - its amazing how they publish stuff this unstable. Avoid or get an older version."
2,Once great product,"This used to be a blinding product. Version 3 was excellent. In fact up to version 7 it was the best value product in the market for what it did. Now it is a dog. It's performance is abysmal, it is unintutitve and it is buggy, If you want to use PSP, forget the marginal functional improvements and use an old version."
2,Corel Paint Shop Pro X,"Did not meet my expectations. Less vale for the money.Causes many computer crashes and loads very slow. I have Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8 which works very well at cost of a fraction of Corel Paint Shop Pro X. Overall I do not recommend to buy it, you'll be sorry."
1,Did not work,"We live on a small pond in Connecticut. Every spring a dozen or so Canadian Geese infest our back yard. I coated the grass with copious amounts of Migrate. It did nothing to deter the geese. They came right back as usual, ate the grass. Just didn't work as advertised."
1,Great fiction... creative author.,"I was given this book by someone from church as I wasn't interested in buying the book. I read it and it was an interesting read. When asked my thoughts by my friend from church I told them that I normally don't read harlequin type novels. As proof that the book was a fictional work I pointed out the death certificate that stated she had died prior to the death certificate actually being in existence. The death certificate that is used in this book has a rev. 1984 or some such year and her death was in 1971 or some such year. The fact remains that she died before the form was even in existence... meaning that the ""proof"" was fictional.As a Christian I get upset when progressives make Christians look like idiots and this book is just one more instance of that happening. I wish people would research stuff before they resend chain letters or believe fictional books that a friend told them is ""true."""
3,"Want to love it, but not completely satisfied",Out of the box this cookware was great. The fit and finish is excellent. Cooking is wonderful with no hot spots like you'd expect with less expensive cookware. My only disappointment is that the non-stick finish does scratch. We use all the appropriate non-metal utincils but after a few years of use the finish isn't what it used to be. For the price one would expect better durability.
5,have been using it for over 20 years,I bought this pan in Germany 26 years ago and still used it all the time. You can not have a better pan for cooking steaks! I am getting ready to buy a new one now since this one has quite a few scratches on it.
1,never cane a chair with this book!,"Ruth B. Comstock was a Cornell University professor who wrote Cornell Bulletins on many useful home ""do it yourself projects"" most types of seats covered in this book (which is just a collection of her bulletins) are adequate and you can learn enough to weave a fine chair seat (Rush, Splint or Sea Grass), however she was never a professional chair caner and her directions for a cane bottom chair are incorrect. While it is possible to cane a seat with this book your final product will be less then perfect and unprofessional. Sadly the majority of chairs you see today have these mistakes as a result of Ruth's writings. Do yourself a favor and buy the more expensive book written by a professional weaver. Ruth was a professional teacher but a novice weaver. If you learn from a novice you cannot expect to rise to the level of professional!"
2,Disappointed,I received this pamplet (not really a book). It was less instructive than I expected and didn't offer as many pictures as I had hoped for.
5,quick delivery,My order was processed and sent very quickly. Arriving just in time for the new semester. The book was in great condition with no highlighting. Thanks for the great service.
5,Great toy for my 4 year old and his 2 year old sister!,"I read the above reviews. My son plays with this toy all the time. He'll play for 30 minutes at a time. The key to this game is making sure you purchase the other ""fusion crews"". This game only comes with 2 fusion crews--which will quick limit the fun. After buying 6 more fusion guys (all with different themes) the fun really begans! I have a 2 year old who loves to play this game with her brother too! I especially like how the kids can't see the fusion guys fight. No violance. The dome covers the players and all the kids see are lights flashing insde the dome-- the flashing lights create shadows of the fighters to make them appear to be fighting. The kids really don't know who wins until the announcer tells them. They seem to like that part best ---as they get to Flush the loser! Get it...your kid(s) will love it."
5,My son loves this! (and so does Dad),"I wish they were still making the Fusion Crew creatures because they made wonderful behavior incentives for my 5 year old son. This game works something like one of those trading card games. My husband used to play ""Magic"" when he was in college so enjoys the Fusion Dome with my son. You stick critter halves together to create your own creature and then compete with the other player. The dome talks you through the process and anounces the name of the creatures by reading a bar code. There are lights and sounds and the loser gets ""flushed"" down the shoot. My son can be pretty hard on his toys and this one seems to be holding up well."
5,Best Money ever spent UPDATE 7/31/06,This is the best gift I purchased for my son for Christmas this year. He has played with it so often we have had to replace the batteries 3 times already. He has just about all the monsters. The only problem we had in the beginning is showing him how to get it to work. Since he has learned how to start it he has had no problems. Love it!!! UPDATE - You can no longer purcahse the fushion dome characters and most of ours have lost arms and do not read when placed on dome. I do feel I got my moneys worth because my son is very rough on his toys. I just wish they would make more.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!,"My son (7) saw this advertised on the tv and wanted it for his birthday. His grandparents bought it for him and he was extremely happy! After about an hour of trying to open the darn package we all took a look at it, read the instructions and still couldn't understand what the toy does!! It was such a waste of money I felt terrible for my parents who spent $35 for a toy that had no meaning, let alone educational value! My son used it for about 15min and hasn't touched it since!!! This does not warrant any stars from me! but I had to choose one)"
1,Waste of time and money,"My sone received this as a gift and was very excited about it at first, but as another reviewer mentioned, it quickly becomes frustrating if you don't follow the directions EXACTLY. After a few minutes he gave up and moved on.I finally donated it to charity with my son's blessing - and this is a kid who saves everything!"
2,Waste of Money,"My 4 yr old begged and begged for this toy and I finally gave in when I found it on clearance. After playing with it for maybe an hour, even he said ""Mommy, this was a waste of money!"" If he doesn't follow the directions exactly in the order said, or tries to skip ahead, the game is unable to keep up and then he gets frustrated. I'm really glad we didn't pay anything close to full price for this useless piece of plastic"
3,my son loves this toy even though we are on our 3rd one!!!!,"I personally think this toy is pretty pointless, but my four year old son loves it!!! It is, by far, his favorite toy from Christmas. He'll even tell you that himself. However, we are on our third one because the two others kept telling us that ""cannot recognize figures"" way too often which makes it very frustrating to me, but not to my son. He loves to wait and find out who the winner will be. Hopefully third time is the charm on this toy and it will keep working!!"
3,fun but not durable,"I bought this toy for my almost 4 year old for christmas. It was by far his favorite toy, but it only lasted 1 week then was having electronic problems. Toysrus said I could exchange it but i am curious to see how long the second one will last."
3,Name Problems,"Like other reviews, my four-year-old son loves this game and loves the figures. My biggest gripe is that it does not identify 75% of the figures; I assume it has trouble reading the barcodes. Unfortunately, one cannot continue with the match-up if the figures cannot be recognized. So then you have to put in one of the 25% that are recognized to bypass and get to the ""fight,"" thereby defeating the purpose of choosing the best fighters. We still have fun and even throw in the (unrelated) Fisher Price Star Wars figures but it is VERY FRUSTRATING to have to wait on the ""figure not recognized"" to be bypassed."
2,Frustrating but sometimes fun,"Sadly, it took me a while to figure how to play this game. lol. It's definently too complex for a 3 year old to play it properly (finding the strongest competitor for each environement, etc.), . The very frustrating part is 9 out of 10 times when we go to ""fuse"" characters together, it machine says ""not recognized"", which this basically then makes it impossible to play. Not sure what the solution is, but i'm pretty annoyed at this point. If it were working properly it would be 5 stars, but right now it's 1 star for me since it never works properly."
5,Exact fit part,Worked as soon as installed. Foam part always melts away so it is a good buy. Fast shipping and always informed on status.
4,Excellent Value - Worked Great For My Craftsman Mower,"I decided to replace the entire air filter this year on my Craftsman Riding Mower, and although I could have obtained this locally for a few dollars more, I decided to skip the trip to the store and buy it here. The Air Filter and Pre-Cleaner filter was a perfect fit, and only took a few minutes to replace. Great value and fast shipping which was free with Prime. Can't ask for more."
2,Doublecheck the ISBN!,"Be careful - this is not the full version that you may need for the class you're taking. I missed the part about it containing only select chapters, and the index actually references pages not actually in the book.Make sure you look this one up by its ISBN.Now I have to buy the complete version for $90 and am probably stuck with the incomplete version for which I paid $75.I am not a happy customer right now."
5,Fantastic information needed in today's business world.,"I loved how this book was so current- it talked about all forms of modern communication that is vital in today's changing business world! The information is delivered in a clear manner, which makes understanding (and studying) this book so much easier than other textbooks."
3,Stylus lasted only three months,"We bought this for my daughter's fourth birthday. She loved it, especially the ""free draw"" and the color-by-number-type activity.She actually became proficient in using it; the reason for the low ranking is that the pen/stylus recently broke/wore out.We're in the process of trying to get it replaced, but from a durability standpoint, this obviously didn't keep up with a toddler."
2,"Great concept, but needs to work out the kinks","I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas, needless to say it will be returned. She loves V Smile and also loves to draw, so I thought this would be perfect. We hooked it up with no problems. Me and my husband both tried to work it, but it was very hard to do. You have to press really hard on the board with the stylus pen and half the time it does not work or it skips in the line that you are drawing.It is a great idea for a learning toy, but I agree with another person that tried this toy-it was pushed to production without working out all the problems. I would love to rebuy this item when the problems are fixed."
4,Years of fun!,"My daughter received this toy when she was 3 she is now 5 and still loves it. She is old enough to play real games on play station yet she always wants to come back and do art studio. If your child is artistic, loves to draw and do make believe with their pictures this is a great toy. It's easy enough for little ones yet complicated enough for your child to grow with. The only problem is the actual game system eats batteries that's the reason I did not give this 5 stars."
1,Vtech Vjunk,"I own a wide range of Vtech toys, the Vtech Art Studio, quite simply, is a useless piece of junk. Very inconsistent sensitivity between the pen/touch pad. This is frustrating not just for my 6 year old but for me too. This kids game definitely requires adult supervision - at all times. Don't waste your money on this game."
2,Paint Station Review,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my 6 year old, and because of the mixed reviews, my 17 yr old daughter and I decided to try it out first...and boy am I glad we did. After a brief discussion, we returned the Paint Station and decided to get something else in it's place. The toy has some definite possibilities, but it's our opinion not enough of the kinks were worked out before it was put on the market. It's true, you do have to press a little harder on the pen, but that's not really a big deal and didn't influence our decision.Some programs worked really well and were fun, but we grew frustrated because other programs didn't work as well and there was one program that didn't work at all. It's our opinion this product would require adult supervision in order to navigate through the 'kinks' so the child wouldn't become exasperated. I think V Smile is close to something really good, so I hope they keep working on improving the product."
1,Really disappointed!,"I bought the Paint Station for my son this morning at TRU. We were so excited to get it home and play with it. Easy to hook up, but you had to basically put all of your weight on the pen to get it to write. Needless to say, it was back at TRU within the hour. I think it could be fun, but the drawing surface was not sensitive enough, and my son got really frustrated with it. I'd consider buying one again if it was redesigned."
4,Absolutely Wonderful,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She absolutely loved it! This is played with more then any of the games that she has. Sometimes you do have to touch it a few times to get it to except your answer, but she doesn't seem to mind. Definetly not a waste of money! Great toy!"
4,A Pleased toddler & mommy,"My 3 year old loves the Art Studio. He especially loves the Free draw and the color mixing. I like the drawing lessons where it shows him how to draw a shape or figure, then allows him to trace it or try on his own. Improvements would be to add another game or more (there are two - if I remember correctly), and allow more mixing of colors. It's really a fun and entertaining product.Thank you.The Bell Family Tampa, FL"
1,frustrating,"I bought this as one my my son's Christmas presents (he only gets 2 from mom and dad). I tried it out tonight to check it out. It hardly works. The stylus just is not responsive. It jumps all over the place and will not draw a line. This makes free drawing useless and the art lessons impossible.Now, with only 1 week until Christmas, I have to scramble to find something else for him.I wasted time and money on this thing. I am contacting the company, and we will see what they say."
4,Love it,"I'm not sure what happened to the other reviewer's clothes... sounds nasty! Maybe she didn't dilute the softener?I've been using this, along with the Method detergent for about a year now & love it. I've never experienced the white gobs...I like that the ""scent"" isn't overpowering. Just fresh. Makes clothes soft & lovely. I like that it is environmentally friendly, too."
3,"Groundbreaking, but not as good as I remembered...","Yes, they have a great sound. Yes, they are consummate musicians. Yes, they had an original sound.But their weakness was in the songs. The songs just weren't that great.""Glamour Boys"" and ""Open Letter (To A Landlord)"", however, ARE great songs, but that's only two. ""Cult of Personality"" sounds awesome once, cool twice, but boring after a few dozen times. Those first two sound as fresh as they did decades ago.The extra tracks are of interest to fans only."
4,Some great songs,"I fast forward thru this album between 'Cult of Personality' and 'Open Letter (To a Landlord)'. I do not care for most of the songs on this album, sorry, but the superior songs on this album are among the best of the 80's. 'Open Letter' is special, I play it when I play the music I really love, and I don't play music much."
5,Love it,"I got this album not long after it came out and I love it still today. This album rocks and it just gets better over time. These guys are super talented and it stands out in their music. Their sound and songs are unique musically and lyrically, written with intelligence and a conscious, and really I can't say enough good things about this album."
3,Great album,"I bought this on Cassette years ago for Cult of Personality, ut leartned to love the whole album. I bought the CD recently to load into iTunes.. CD came in excellent shape and the songs imported flawlessly."
5,An amazing album.,"This album was amazing when it came out, and still is today. Simply a steal at $3.99 with bonus tracks!"
5,Loved this album for years,"I remember hearing Cult of Personality on Mtv when it was new and I loved it. I bought the album that same week and loved every song. My Fav on this CD is Desperate People. The extras are really good with the exception of the cover of the Clash Classic ""Should I Stay or should I Go"" I think this has to be the worst cover of an awesome song since Krokus covered Ballroom Blitz! Otherwise the Remastering is wonderful."
3,"Classic album, but poor remaster","I think this is a great album. I already had the original and bought the remaster hoping to have the sound spruced up a bit. However, it sounds worse than the original. The bass is muddy and overbearing, the highs sound muffled, and its got to be by far the loudest CD I now own. If you have the original, stay with it. If not, then I suggest you find one."
4,Eureka Timberline 6 review,"I needed to replace my car camping/kick around tent,which was an 18 yr. old Timberline 4. The Timberline design is about as fast and easy setup as it gets,and all things considered, not bad stability. The new outfitter 6 is a step up as it has stronger materials and two doors. I am 6'2"" and have headroom to stand up straight. This is a luxurious walk in,A-frame cabin tent for 2,with a ton of gear and cots! It will comfortably sleep 4 or 5,(6 in a pinch). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is Eureka only put 2 mesh pockets in a tent this size(why not 4 or 6 ?). Also the heavy, awkward, hard to use metal clips that attach the body to the fly could have been nylon/fastex. I highly recommend this tent for car camping, basecamp,even some canoe camping."
5,Leader Tent,"This tent is used for leaders of our local Boy Scout troop. I have spent many nights in this tent and wouldn't have any other. Eureka tents are well built, the only replacement part needed is a pole every once in a while. As it stand the troop owns 4 of the Eureka 6.10 by 8.5 Timberline Outfitters and 8 of the smaller Eueka Timberlines that the Scouts use. Eureka Timberline Tents- Well worth the price."
5,Great basecamp tent,"We have used the Timberline 4 and 6 Outfitter series in our Boy Scout troop for years. I have also used and still use the Apex 4. I love Eureka tents.The Timberline 6 is a roomy tent that will comfortably sleep 3 adults with the winter gear for a week. In seasons requiring less equipment, it is great for 4 people for long outings.Set up is easy. If set up properly and tied down as instructed, I have used this tent with no problems in steady 40 MPH winds. One of the other Scout leaders had one set up in his back yard when Katrina came through Memphis. There was not a drop of rain that got in."
2,Somewhat enjoyable but where was Flinn's editor???,"This book feels more like a collection of unrelated magazine articles than a book. A lot of the information is repeated (Funny Girl & Gypsy had the best overtures, pit bands are good, etc) and especially towards the end, the author goes from historian to strident critic."
2,"Great intro, but not much else","The introductory chapter on the history of musical theatre from ancient Greece to the 20th century is outstanding. I've never read any account that was better or more thorough. Unfortunately, that's the only strong part of the book. The rest of it is dull to read and contains many factual errors. Still, I'd recommend borrowing it from the library just to read the intro."
5,A very useful large glass lid,I broke the lid that accompanied a large frying pan. I ordered this from Amazon and it fits beautifully. I recommend it heartily!E. Holden
5,An excellent book,"A sound academic, historical and theoretical treatment of the Northern Ireland conflict, with insights that are highly relevant for scholars of the Palestine conflict as well. A real pleasure to read. I recommend it highly."
2,Ineffective Comedy and Drama,"A not very interesting melange of family interactions and problems of religious rivalry and assimilation in a modern European French-speaking country. There are some mildly humorous aspects and intermittent pathos, but not enough drama or comedy to maintain full interest. Surreal dream scenes do not contribute much."
1,weak sticks,product came in the mail somewhat fast but these sticks are not strong and do not hold together well. they broke within 20 minutes of playing. for the whole review please check out powaydrumsource.com
5,Very satisfied,"This is a book to take for a flight, or for a weekend stuck in a hotel away from home. It is easy to read, and the intrigue prevents you from leaving the reading, so you'd better have some food close enough, and some drink too!"
4,Box slightly damaged from shipping,"The only reason I care about the box being damaged is because my husband is a collector and wouldn't be taking this out of the box. I orderd this for him as a Christmas present and it was a backordered item, so it took about ten weeks to get it. Once I received it, Christmas was a few short weeks away so that is why I did not return it for a new one. The other thing I was dissatisfied with was the warning label (it's not removable) that is on the frot of the box that takes away from the show quality. None of the other Family Guy action figures that my husband owns have this label on the front of the product. They are all on the back."
3,No Hose Clamps,"This may seem like a minor item by not including the hose clamps, but I would prefer to get what I paid for and using the old hose clamps is not always the best idea. Luckily I had purchased a variety box of hose clamps from Harbor Freight that did the job. Otherwise the fuel filter was exactly what I needed."
2,I like ripper better with priest,"Iced earth have always been mediocre to me,very outstanding solid riff's,but never much else.Matt Barlow was a good vocalist and fit the band and gave them there trade mark sound,but much is lost with ripper.Ripper has one of the most power voice's i've heard in many years,but for some odd reason it just doesnt fit the music,its like he stepped into Master of Puppets,when he was doing stuff that sounded more like Priest.Also iced earth music is to repetitous for me,they need to expand there sound more,venture out a little.The only album i've really gotten into from this band is The Dark Saga,mainly becuase it had more variety and more beauty i guess.This just get's old quick,although Red Baron is a killer song(classic) it can't save the rest of the album which to me is lackluster."
2,Fans or fools?,"Besides the cheesy patriotic lyrics and the songs itself bla bla bla, what really [upset me] is the release scheme of this album which makes I.E. fans of fools! Yes, because there is a U.S. version with the songs Sprangled Banner and Greenface whichare not on European version! Plus, the European version comes with the song Waterloo which is not on U.S. Version! And, to get all songs, we must fight for a limited 2CD set containing the complete tracklist plus an unplugged song. Well, they think we are stupid, this is the only answer for such disrespect with fans... Do yourselves a favor and go for Jag Panzer's Decade Of The Nail Spiked Bat double album, because THIS one is a tribute to Panzer's old and new fans. Peace, Rodrigo."
2,keep trying,Ripper belongs in a cover band because he doesn't have what it takes to be a headliner. The production on this album is thin. Horror show was to muddy and this is weak. I'm sick of the long songs that have no point. Dark Saga and Something wicked are masterpieces. The songs are focused and Barlow's voice is so unique its a crime he left. Rippers delivery is weak thats all there is to it dump him. Beef up the guitar sound and shorten the songs
2,"a few good songs, but overall a disapointment","The Reckoning is the only really good song on this CD. Green Face isn't bad nor is Red Baron/Blue Max, but the rest just don't feel like Iced Earth. Maybe they just missed a step since Barlow's departure, but the album just seems lacking in intensity. If you want some of the best metal ever, go back to their old stuff, like Stormrider, Something Wicked, Dark Saga, and Burnt Offerings, this just isn't worth the $15.... and anyone who says Matt Barlow was a bad singer wouldn't know metal if it stabbed them in the face with a soldering iron."
4,Get 2 CD version,"Alright well I bought the 2 cd version which is a must have. For those of you reading this get the 2 cd version which has Waterloo on it. The reason for doing this review is I saw some moron typing ebonics which I can't stand. The guy said the cd sucked and to listen to stained and a whole bunch of other nu metal (shudders). Well the cd is great. The reason I gave it four stars is because it's not the 2 cd version. I gave the 2 cd version five stars. Anyway the album rocks. Tim Owens is a great replacement for Matt Barlow, Jon couldn't have picked anyone better to handle the vocals. The album covers a lot of historical figures and historical events. The Gettysburg epic is just plain awesome. Jon got the Prague Philharmonic orchestra to play on the epic. So buy the 2 cd version and ignore the nu metal morons."
4,A Metallic History Lesson,"The elimination of Matt Barlow from this band was simply addition by subtraction, as his Paul Stanely-esque voice seemed more appropriate for Hard Rock than Power Metal. Anyways, this is a grand culmination of years of hard work from Jon Shaeffer, and lets hope it opens the doors to a new legion of fans. (Hopefully becoming the first Iced Earth CD to crack the Billboard Top 200 as well!)This CD (particularly the epic ""Gettysburg"") should automatically be added to every American High School History curriculum. Not only would kids learn an accurate portrayal of the American Revolution, but it could turn impressionable teens away from pop and nu-metal garbage (Limp Triscuit, Kid Retard, etc) and towards, real, true, metal."
4,"Glorious yes, a burden...no!","I was skeptical of how new vocalist Tim ""Ripper"" Owens would sound with Iced Earth. To me, Matthew Barlow was the voice of Iced Earth and I felt it would be difficult, at best, to replace him. With respect to Matt, Owens is a perfect fit for Iced Earth. I also have to give credit to new guitarist Ralph Santolla. His solo on the song Valley Forge reminded me so much of the late, great Randy Rhodes. If ever a song cried, no, screamed to be mixed in 5.1 surround it's Gettysburg! I was afraid I'd get bored during this 31 minute epic. I was wrong.Other songs that stood out for me were Declaration Day, Hollow Man, Valley Forge & When The Eagle Cries (unplugged). In all honestly, there's not a single dud in the entire CD. Definitely a must buy!"
4,Attila the great,"The Song Attila is quintessential Iced earth. What a great track and Tim Owens sounds ok on this one. Matt Barlow co-wrote this with Jon S and I would have loved to have listened to his version. I don't really want to join the masses and beat up on Tim, but I will anyway - he is not a great singer, but he can scream though. Perhaps I'm being overly harsh here due to the fact that I don't find a lot of emotion in his voice, where Matt's pipes most of the time ooze with heaps of emotion and melody.From a marketing and exposure point of view, Jon made the best possible choice in having Tim join the band. I hope that the band continues to earn the respect that they deserve and I hope that if Tim stays in the band that they move away from writting ballad type songs as Tim is totally not suited to this style.This is not their best CD but it does have some excellent songs like The Reckoning, Greenface ,Redbaron/Blue Max and of course Attila. The Trilogy is good, not great."
3,"A musical masterpiece, but drop Ripper.","Many of us are familiar with the kickass sounds of Iced Earth. Though musically they are still geniouses [unlike my spellin], the new lead Ripper [Judas Priest] is a real let down for this album. The only thing waieghing it down infact. Matt Barlow I think we can alll agree is the best IE vocalist this far. He was so much more into it. Ripper is about emotionless screaming which kind of distracts you from the brilliance behind The Glorious Burden. enough og my ranting. About the album itself I can say little. The only songs I found tollerable were When the Eagle Cries and The Reckoning. Not exactly a total flop, but not a rembrant creation itself. Do yourself a favor and get The Dark Saga or Something Wicked This Way Comes."
5,Phenomenal,"The Glorious Burden turned out much better than I expected. While the lyrics to the songs can be somewhat corny from time-to-time, the overall product is impressive. I find myself listening to the Gettysburg trilogy most of the time as it is easily the highlight of the album. Other favorites are The Reckoning, Attila, and Red Baron / Blue Max. Quite a step up from Horrow Show and possibly their best to date."
1,Brain Dead,"Putting this album on was almost akin to entering a survivalist camp. Not only is the music horribly dated (Euro Metal circa 1981), but the brainless flag waving and chest beating are repelent. As a lover of good music and at least half decent lyrics, this journey into a redneck's mind is a complete turn off. Regurgitated riffs that make Puddle Of Mudd sound inovative and songs that are nothing more than tuneless dirges make this a complete and utter disaster."
1,cmon ...,"First, Barlow is gone from the mic so gone is the best metal vocalist in the business. Replace him with the Ripper who is good at imitating Halford but does not go well with schaffers riffs at all. He can't hit low notes and the melodies are terrible. Speaking of riffs, they are dreadful. This album sounds extremely forced. The songs have about two-three riffs at max in them and the songs themselves are 4-5 minutes apiece: yes this means that they become very boring. Hey how about the lyrics? They are pathetically childish. I'm not even going to get into that but trust me they are weak.If you liked the past masterpieces Iced Earth has put out, please i warn you of this album. It will let you down and you may actually cry to see such an amazing band drift so far from the brilliance of their previous efforts."
1,bs,"only a couple of good songs. rest of the cd is crap.one more thing to note. song writers should sit down and learn history before writing songs based on ""true"" historic events."
1,When the Eagle Craps,"My country has produced a lot of bad metal in the past few years, but just because Iced Earth sounds retro doesn't make them any dumber than numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn.Getting Owens to sing the songs was bad enough, but they also just had to go patriotic and sum up all the reasons why America kicks ass. The band's conclusion? Apparently, we rule because we had a Civil War.If you want to listen to Iron Maiden-style music, then listen to Iron Maiden. If you want to listen to Metallica-style music, then listen to (pre-Load) Metallica. Don't settle for a cheap knock-off of both bands. Oh and if you want to feel patriotic, well, I don't have any advice for anyone who doesn't watch FoxNews on a regular basis."
3,not as good as i thought it would be,i heard a number of great reviews for this album so that is why i bought it. its good... don't get me wrong. but its not earth shattering. ild pay the download price for it.
3,Iced earth now...,"I looove iced earth! I have almost all of their albums and tim owens has a kick ass voice. But, Matt Barlow will always be the real singer for Iced Earth. His Voice is unique Metal instrument that can only be identified with Iced Earth's music. This is a good album but it has been hard for me to get into it..no matter how much I try. I'm an iced earth fan so that's why I own it but, Matt Barlow will never be fully replaced I think."
3,Buy at your own risk...,"If you are a die-hard fan of Iced Earth this is the cd for you. Matt Barlow fans won't be happy with this at all. I like Ripper Owens vocals, but he doesn't do all that good of a job for this cd. If you are looking for an Iced Earth cd, look towards: The Dark Saga, Days of Purgatory, Something Wicked This Way Comes or Horror Show. Save your money, don't buy The Glorious Burden!"
5,masterpiece,"I was somewhat skeptical about this album because of the departure of Matt Barlow. Fortunately Tim Owens has grown on me and sounds great on this album, Especially on Gettysburg, which is one of the greatest epics I've ever heard. Some tracks on this CD are better than others, but they're all good. Jon Schaffer is a very gifted musician and just gets more amazing. This is one of the best Iced Earth albums ever. By the way,to the reviewer who calls himself Fred Durst Numba One Fann you are an @$$ Hole. Obviously all of your reviews are pathetic jokes and I'm sure you think you're hilarious. Well You are a silly little peon who doesn't deserve to discuss good music. So get your hand out of your pants and stop getting off on these retarded antics. Get a life loser. Have a nice day. Iced Earth Rules"
4,Buy It!,"Im a Iced earth fan and when barlow left i too had my doubts,i actually waited a whole year before picking this up,now two months after having it is one of my favorite iced earth albums as well one of my top-ten all time metal albums,i even like the two ballads everybody is talking crap about,if you like Maiden and old Metallica,you cant go wrong,ans as a side note i would expect Iced Earth next album to be even better,as jon shaffer has had alot of time to write,because of his back injury,and with Tim owens now fully integrated into the band i cannot wait until the next Iced Earth cd,supposedly the continuation of the ""Something Wicked storyline"""
4,It grows on you,"I've been listening to ""Glorious Burden"" for the past two or three days, and like ""Horror Show"" it sort of grows on you the more you listen to it.When I first bought it I wasn't that excited about it because, let's face it, Matt Barlow is gone and the theme is atypical to IE. But I've come to enjoy Tim Owens's screeching, especially on ""Declaration Day"". The background vocals are also stellar on man y of the tracks.It does have a few low spots, I'm in the military and even I think ""Green face"" is a little cheesey. ""Atilla"" is okay, but ""Red Baron"" and ""Gettysburg"" blow me away. If this is the new direction of Iced Earth it might work. Now hopefully they can get noticed and signed to a major label so more people can discover them."
2,Iced Earth~~~Glorious Burden,"This band is a very good, hardworking band. At first listen i thought it was alright, but i didn't want to buy the album quite yet. after downloading 2 songs, i was thinking about buying the album. then a friend of mine bought the cd, i listened to it. now i think it is horrible!is this a heavy metal band,or an opera cd?the singer is just a little more deeper than that retard vocalist in THE DARKNESS. [they suck also]i listened to the whole cd with an open mind, then i let my other friend listen to it, he asked if it was some sort of mix between opera and metal. the music is good, but find a better vocalist.the only reason i am not giving them 1 star is that they dont follow or copy bands, and that is hard to find these days"
5,THE RIPPER IS BACK!!!!!!!!,"I NEVER LISTENED TO ICED EARTH BEFORE THIS CD.BEING A HUGE PRIEST FAN AND A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF TIM ""THE RIPPER OWENS"". AND FOR THAT REASON, AND HUNGRY FOR NEW MUSIC BY HIM I PURCHAESD THE NEW DISC WHICH MUCH DELIGHT. I LOVE ROB HALFORD IN PRIEST BUT FAVORED THE HEAVY DIRECTION OF JUGULATOR AND DEMOLITION WITH TIM.ANYWAY A TRUE METAL HEAD WILL LOVE THE NEW ICED EARTH DISC IT IS A MASTER PIECE OF METAL AND HISTORY.IVE NOW PURCHASED ALIVE IN ATHENS AND ENJOY IT WHITH MATT BARLOW ON VOCALS, BUT WITH RESPECT TO MATT, TIMS VOCALS PUT THE BAND ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. TIM KICKS ASS, THE BEST IN METAL!!!!!!! NEW ICED EARTH FAN!!!"
2,sorry Iced Earth fans...,"I had heard good things about Iced Earth and decided to pick up one of their albums. I ended up buying this one. I'm sure if I was American I would appreciate the patriotism, and if I cared about Historic events i might enjoy this album more. And I found the Gettysberg thing to be a slowly crawling epic, which really got boring. I still might check out some other Iced Earth someday, but this album killed my curiosity of this band for the time being."
4,Glorious Burden,"Well first off I have to comment on the lyrics, they have good meaning, but i think they could have worked on making it sound not so much like a story, and more like a song. But otherwise it is a solid album. Great guitar and doesn't have a bad song on it. If you are a fan of Iced Earth I would definatly get this album. It doesn't top Something Wicked or Horror Show, but it is still good."
3,Good,Its a good album but I'm not sure what version Amazon sent me.1. Declaration Day2. When the Eagle Cries3. The Reckoning (Don't Tread on Me)4. Attila5. Red Baron/Blue Max6. Hollow Man7. Valley Forge8. Waterloo9. The Devil to Pay10. Hold at All Costs11. High Water Mark
2,Their worst album till now,First of all i dont like the vocals. He is an imitation of Rob halford. And this voice is good for judas Priest but not for Iced Earth. He sounds like [...]. We dont like so high tone of voice . The previous singers are much better. The music is also not so good. The re is no comparison to the dark saga nad something wicked this way comes. only for iced Earth collectors
5,Impressive,"An excellent album even though Barlow wasn't on vocals. Owens delivers very nicely and his style fits very well for the songs on the album.The star-spangled banner intro and the three songs that follow will blow you away showing Iced Earth can still play metal - not like all this numetal crap goin around.The album weakens a little after The Reckoning, but ends stongly with Valley Forge and Waterloo.I got the limited edition with the Gettysburg trilogy on the second disc. Personally, just hearing this is worth paying $20 for. Schaffer's knowledge, creativity, and songwriting is at it's best.Overall I was expecting a good album, but not this good of an album. Go out and get it. 5/5"
1,Disorganized and verbose with little useful information,"This pompously written book offers little to the home mechanic searching for useful information on Weber carburators. While the author is content to ramble on at length about his own vast powers of perception, he neglects to offer even the most basic guides to choice of parts, proper running conditions, and tuning. There are very few parts charts, and the engines used as examples are all English and mostly out of date. All the diagrams are lifted directly from Weber's own shop manuals. The author's admission on page 42 that his own car runs very badly when cold and uses an obsolete form of carburetor is testament to his lack of troubleshooting and tuning skills. His inability to keep even his own car running well, an inability he thinly disguises with an authoritarian, opinionated writing style, undermines his credibility. Buy the Haynes book or, better yet, the BTR Engineering book (hard to find in the US)."
5,Quality Drum,"Bought this as a replacement for a lost 3/4"" drum. Turned out to be better quality than the one I lost."
4,Romantic vision of Cuba,This novel is a great example of romantic literature from Cuba in the 1840's. It was written before Uncle Tom's Cabin but still shows the situation of slaves and the need for reform. A must read for people interested in slavery or early female writers. The romantic movement in literature is very strong in this book but still provides a great historical viewpoint.
3,The Claudette Colbert Collection,I liked all the movies but one ( it was the movie not Claudette that I didn't want) and I threw that dvd away but the rest I have in my collection. Thanks for the chance to get the collection.Ireta Clemons
3,universals terrible for classic sets,"I'm not sure how many movies are crammed onto how many discs;this info is not easily found,but if form holds, (see carole lombard/mae west/john wayne sets,you can count on poor flip cases,easy to break hard plastic hubs,a lack of good artwork, and no extras.its true that warner has lost its commitment to their previous standards of excellence,but universal has never cared for the classic movie fan,no individual cases,either.Didn't DeMmille deserve abeter fate than the box universal put out? alans alley"
3,A Review of Oats and Wild Apples,"Frank Asch is on my entering kindergartener's Summer Reading List and we have really become fans of his. HOWEVER, we did not particularly care for this particular book.While the illustrations are lovely and classic Asch, the book did not engross us the way that his other books have.The story is a sort of version of Country Mouse/City Mouse. A baby deer (separated from his mother by wolves) persuades a calf to spend the day with him. After tasting delicious apples from a wild apple tree, the calf tells the deer that they are almost as good as oats. The deer then goes into the 'civilized' grounds of the calf's farm.Like in Country Mouse/City Mouse nothing is resolved except that each animal decides that they like their native habitat best.Three stars. Good artwork, but story was average."
5,air filter for Briggs,I ordered this air filter for my lawn tractor. It is just what I expected and not some know off ill fitting Chinese product masquerading as a Briggs and Stratton part on discount.
4,book review,"Informative and entertaining,another good effort by Mr. Beck. I recommend this for any fan of animation."
2,"Somewhat inaccurate for a portrayal of ""Greedy""","I know that Roger Hargreaves wrote these books when his son asked him what a tickle, a sneeze, a daydream, or a worry looks like. The first one was Mr. Tickle, then came Mr. Greedy. I know Roger Hargreaves wrote these as epitomes and personifications of behaviors, but I think the story would have been better off being about: ""Mr. Greedy had plenty of stuff. But it didn't satisfy him-he just wanted more."" and ends with him appreciating what he did have. Either that or he should have been called, ""Mr. Plump"" or ""Mr. Glutton""."
3,disappointing product,"Its a DVD I had been waiting for, and Amazon.com sent an e-mail alert on its production. There's nothing in the world I would like to do better than watch Melissa in a concert, all alone.Her performance, alone, for example in MTV Unplugged is amazing!! It has more energy than a whole band, an experience...But I think the producers of this DVD have got it all wrong!They have failed to capture the full personality, the strong presence of Melissa on the stage. And they have also failed to capture the mood of the audience, so essential to enjoying a concert video."
2,too much information...but the music ok,I still like the music but i can do without all the baggage of the second cd.Sincerity can't be faked and it appears Mizz M is tired of hearing about the 'gay' issue ref: the scene where a chick reads a 1 minute script written by a kid who is gay.I'm happy to return to the 'listening' only version of this artist. I think over the top fan would love the CD but the everyday person might feel it's a little too much to take.[...]
2,You need a band,"I like Melissa Etheridge, but i'm not crazy about this DVD. As the title says, she's ""Live and Alone"" on stage. I can understand her feeling more connected to the crowd when she's doing it all by herself. But to me she is still an artist without a band. The music sounds ok, but i can hear that something is missing. The songs on CD certainly sounds better. I'm giving it two stars because it is not totally bad. But it would have been much better with some support. I'll probably give this DVD away. It's not worth my time."
5,Awesome Melissa Etheridge,"Why did we have to wait so long for such an awesome live DVD of the genial Melissa Etheridge.This DVD will captivate you infront of the TV for the 2 hour Concert. Make sure you have got some space to dance ...The Dolby Digital Sound (5.1) makes you feel being right infront of the stage and that feels great.Etheridge plays all by herself and the show is very diversified.12String, Electric, 6String, Doubleneck, Piano, Harmonica, percussion on the back of a guitar and acapella.She impresses as she allways does. My personal highpoint is her performance of ""Ready to Love"" a song she wrote when she was 17 but nerver recorded it. The bonus material on disc 2 is also very special and I devoured it.Thank you Melissa for finally giving the fans what they allways wanted ... I can't wait to get the DVD with a band performance next year ;-)"
5,Really meant a lot,"This DVD meant a lot because I was in Fort Worth, Texas for the Sept. 11 concert that was cancelled. As we all watched the world fall apart that morning it was surreal at best.I finally am able now with this DVD to see the concert I missed.It is clear that she is still very much in love with Julie as you see her eyes when she sings her songs. I thought I'd get bored with a solo acoustic tour but I was very wrong, this DVD is amazingly powerful and captivating.Her version of Joan Armatrading's song ""The weakness In me"" was just fabulous. She really connects to the audience and speaks from the heart.I think that Melissa, as a songwriter, is so warm and inviting because of that ability to connect with the audience on a very personal and heartfelt level. She's all about heart and being herself and you can't help but love her for that.You'll enjoy all of this."
3,Great Performance hindered by weak Presentation,"As expected you will most likly find Melissa very entertaining, but the quality of the filming leaves something to be desired. The lighting is poor and the entire concert is filmed in a grainy film look...especially grainy in low light scenes. All this is not good for viewing on a large screen TV.On the other hand the Audio is in full crystal clear 5.1 Digital sound. The quality of the sound does not match to the poor quality of the video. Problem here is that the disc will not default to 5.1 and must be selected each time you play the discI understand the idea and the feel behind the grainy look, but the director and producer of this disc should learn from the James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles discs which are shot in beautiful ""Jump off the screen"" type picture quality.Great extras, Great Sound, poor picture. Three Stars"
4,Excellent pan but scratches easily,"I bought this pan after a good amount of research, and it turned out to be a good choice. It heats evenly, sears well, cleans up easily, and is good looking too. The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it appears to scratch pretty easily. I used a wooden spatula and there were about 3-4 scratches after wards. So be sure to use silicone spatulas."
2,peeling even with great care,"we have been super careful and only used rubber heat-proof utensils and this pan's surface is just coming off in little pock marks. I had a Calphalon that did the same and hoped this one would be better. It's exactly the same. Disappointed and now going to look into the guarantee. The Calphalon also had a life-time guarantee, but you had to pay over $25 to certify ship back to them to replace."
4,good book...,"I liked this book. While saving up for my iBook, I just had to have this book!!! I needed something to satisfy my ibook craving.. :P LOL.. But really, it's a good book.. I could prepare myself for my ibook.. ;)"
2,DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH,"I bought the book and was a bit dissapointed when I received it. Just a tiny booklet -How much information could this contain? It seems to have three goals: to convince you the Ibook is nice (true), to give general information about some features of the Ibook (which you could also find in a manual), and to sell accessories (A considerable part of the pages are dedicated to accessories, mentioning how good they are, the website of the company that sells it, and the price)Useful information? Yes. How much? Not a lot."
5,Great Lid,"This is the perfect lid for our 12"" Le Creuset skillet. It fits like a glove, looks great, and adds functionality to a skillet we use almost daily. Bonus - It doesn't add a lot of weight to an already massive pan."
5,Makes a great skillet even greater,"When I started using the 13-inch non-stick skillet from Berndes, it opened a new world of fat-free cooking--the best pan I'd ever owned. But sometimes, I needed to cover some dish I was cooking and the only thing I had large enough was a cookie sheet--it worked, but awkwardly. So I sent for this glass lid, and I now have the perfect combination. The lid fits the skillet to a T and functions by keeping moisture and heat inside the pan when that's what I require. The tempered glass seems rugged and hard to break or chip. I recommend this glass lid 100%."
4,Black and Decker 241125-00 Fan MM Series Electric Mowers,"The product appears to be identical to the original part in all respects and is easy to install. As mentioned by others, the original part has a design flaw -- the outside corner of each fan blade can strike one of several screw caps in the body of the mower, especially when one is mowing in high grass and grass clippings are clogging the area around the blade. When this occurs a piece of the fan blade is eroded, or in the worse case, the fan blade breaks off. I eventually lost four of eight blades on the mower fan and the mower would barely operate (the fan really does help cool the mower's motor). To avoid this, I filed about 1/16th of an inch off of the outer 1/2 inch of each blade before installation. The mower has run fine and there is no evidence of the fan blades hitting the screw caps."
3,modifications needed,"I was glad to find this on Amazon, but had the same experience as so many others. The outer corners of the fan blades strike against the screw heads at the top of the fan housing. I ended up using a dremel tool to grind down the blades enough to clear the screw heads. Given the time needed to do these adjustments, the installation of this part took alot longer than it should have."
4,"Factory part, and that was the issue.","My fan had been breaking on my mower since day one. Looking underneath it, I noticed that the fan blades came dangerously close to some exposed bolt heads - sometimes, in particularly long grass, they would hit them! This stress led to many a broken blade and the eventual failure of the original fan.On this replacement, I toyed around with possible fixes to this problem. The solution that worked the best was (carefully) carving away the material at the end of the blade with a razor knife until they cleared the bolts. Be sure NOT to: 1) Take off more material than necessary, or 2) Cut yourself, because you are not an improperly designed fan blade."
5,What Doesn't Amazon Sell!,"This an OEM replacement part. Anyone who owns a Black and Decker mower of this series will someday come to realize that this plastic piece will break. Thankfully the part is an easy fix and an exact fit. I picked up 3 assuming someday this part will not be available thus rendering my mower obsolete.Curiously, the mower can run OK with a broken flute but once you break a few, it's time for a replacement. Shame on Black and Decker for this design. The bottom of a lawnmower is no place for plastic parts.Overall great price for a valuable part!"
1,Black and Decker 241125-00 Fan for MM Series Electric Mowers,"After two years only one fan blade remained. Caused the motor to have a difficult time getting up to speed, also making a loud grinding noise in the process. This was because assembly became out of balance (the blade was not). Should be rated 0 stars (fan only). Incredibly poor choice of material. Love the mower otherwise (MM575)."
1,VERY poor design,"This is the second fan I've ordered for my MM675. I love the mower, but this component is ridiculously constructed of brittle (read easily breakable) plastic. If you run over a piece of solid debris your fan is pretty much toast. The first time I ordered this part the mower was a new product and I had to find a company that specializes in supplying mower repair shops to get this replaced. The fact that it is even available on Amazon says it all. This will almost certainly not be the last time I order this item, unless I get fed up and buy another mower..."
3,"It is what it is, but narrower...","I get these vinyl hoses as toys for my ferrets. They were narrower than 4"" at different points in the hose, but I've ordered more than one and they come the same. Not important if you're using it for air.Price was okay considering these vinyl hoses are being phased out for the aluminum ones (*not* good for ferret tunnels), shipping was fast."
5,Pure Benson,"George Benson- Live in Montreux, 1986 is Benson at his best! With a running time of 103 minutes or so, this DVD is priceless, and it leaves you wanting more.First of all, the DVD is very well put together from start to finish. No fillers, no interviews, no talking, just George and the band doing their thing. The video and sound quality is excellent and so is the set list which showcases 18 songs, all superbly done.Benson even acknowledges then band member, guitarist Michael O'Neill. O'Neill sounds great here in the spotlight and he also spent several years playing in the George Benson camp before going solo. O'Neill's 2000 release ""Never Too Late"" is sprinkled with a Benson flavor. It is very enjoyable and is definitely worth the purchase.This DVD is a must for the Benson fans. George delivers 100%, both singing and playing. This one's a keeper! Five stars isn't enough!"
2,Not The Best of George Benson,"Even though I am definitely a George Benson lover and a ""jazz queen"", I expected a little more from this DVD. George sung several of his hits, but too many more of the OLD jazz songs that weren't his. This DVD was just ""ok"" -- I would save my money and buy perhaps a DVD that is entitled ""The Best of George Benson"" because this DVD does not consist of a lot of his hit songs. If I were to rate it, I would give it two and one-half stars out of five."
1,uk problems,this dvd will not play in the uk on most of the dvd players sold hear the good news is that i received a full refund from amazon
4,Great product,"I bought this to replace an old Berndes pan, I had purchased at a major kitchen supply retailer about 11 years ago. I absoultely love the Berndes products."
3,Probably Not the Best Package,"My 3-star rating applies to the product, not the music. Unless you're completely driven by cost or memories, this CD is not an efficient way to purchase the music. It combines live tracks from 1958 with studio tracks from 1955, as a result of marketing decisions dictated by the limitations of LP records, and has become obsolete. You can get the live music in its full context withAt Newport 1958and the two studio tracks as bonus material accompanying the album produced during the same recording session:Round About Midnight."
5,Hotter Than A $50 Rolex!,"Pistol hot. Two giants of jazz for the price of one, up close and personal. These guys are whipping up a storm furious enough to blow the spots off a leopard. Davis and Coltrane are in total telepathic touch with each other, particularly remarkable when you realize that most of this CD consists of concert performances, no studio sweetening, just the real deal. If you like spicy cooking, you'll be back for seconds."
2,Not particularly useful on my camera,"This device is a good idea, but presented some problems when used on my Sony A100. After taking a photo, the image wss gone by the time I could open the cover. It also made it more difficult to shoot a level photo, but that can be fixed by practice. I removed it and have had no difficulties since."
4,Nice,the makeover came in handy especially when u have a like one that loves to play in makeup & all
4,Bratz Doll 2,Great toy. My daughter enjoyed and actually still plays with it more than 6 months later.
2,Alot of details missing....,"I used a learn Html in 24 hours book before and it really helped. This one on the other hand did not. For the true beginner, it leaves out information and assumes you know details. For instance, using compilers, command lines, it skips the basics of this and just tells you to ""install something"" and go. Doesn't explain why things are spaced the way they are, or if it matters.Would have been much much better for beginners if it went into that kind of detail better. I'm going to find a better book.Weak."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"Just know this book has you developing code in the SDK, not Visual Studio .NET. If anything that should turn you away from buying this.Any .NET programmer WILL be working with Visual Studio and not an SDK.The SAMS teach yourself C# in 24 hours was completely written for VS .NET, so I am confused as to why this book was not.Get another book as this one will be only of use for terminology and OOP theory. It was a waste on Money for me."
3,There are better books to start with.,I started out as a big fan of this book. The introductory chapters were great. But the book soon lost its focus. It seems the authors started writing chapters on individual aspects of C# without a clear idea of what they were trying to teach and how it all worked together to produce functional C# code. I was disappointed after being excited at the beginning. I've had much better luck now with the C# How to Program book from the Deitels.
5,You'll read it cover to cover and keep it for reference,"This book was awesome! I just finished reading it today and I am amazed of how much I learned.I disagree with the comment that rates it bad for not talking enough about Visual Studio.... There are good books about ""Visual C#"" which target this audience, however the best developers are those who learn how to build software from scratch without fancy tools.Trust me, before this, I had no idea what was all the code Visual Studio (and even SharpDevelop) generated by default.Recommended path:I read 1 chapter a day; then took the chapter quiz, and did all the exercises.Also play with the ""Type and Run's"", they are a lot of fun!I am now writing my own C# applications (Console, Windows-based, Web, and even for my Pocket PC).Excellent book, great job Brad Jones!"
4,So far it's been good,"I'm very glad to finally see a book out that doesn't require people to spend a vast fortune buying Visual Studio, while that is fine for corporate development many personal developers can't afford the rather steep price tag associated to Visual Studio."
1,If u really cook this will not hold up!,"I cook on this thing about 3x's/day and the pan and coating are so poorly made it did not hold up. The coating is so thin that after a few uses you begin to see color changes in this product and over a period of a year it is complete garbage because everything is sticking to this!!!Sorry to say but this item did not last long enough to justify the price of this thing.I have seen all the glowing reviews on this product and wonder if any of these people work for the company? This is why I initially purchased my two pans due to all the glowing reviews but it is not worth it. Don't ask me what is worth it because at this point I do not know but do your research well.For me that pan did not hold up and is poorly made no matter what the reviews say, it is one step up from the Target garbage with a fancy name and place it is made but nothing more from all I saw!!"
2,"problem,returned","After the very first time I used the pan, a small hole developed in the coating so that you could see metal. I do not think I did anything while cooking to explain the hole,and actually first noticed it when i started to use the pan again. I considered keeping the pan,but worry the hole would grow. I asked for a refund,but may reorder as it had nice features,but first want to study other similar pans."
4,Fair Tinker Mare,"Purchased for young girl who loves 'horsies' - this was unique in it's look - sorry to find that it was made in China, though. Nice for display shelf - not sure if it will see much playtime."
3,Bratz Sleepover Kit,The price was more affordable through Amazon. And since it was a Bratz Christmas for my daughter this added a nice touch to her collection.
1,waist of money,"Sleeping bag was way too thin. bag zipper broke in a couple of months. With bag and contents that came with it, it still was over priced."
2,Wenger Aquagraph Diver #72239,This is a quartz watch. The seconds hand did not align with the seconds tick marks on the dial between 12:00 and 6:00. You would think a retail $300+ watch could make this happen. This is another Wenger watch that I sent back for the same problem.
4,OEM Briggs Part,"This is a OEM part as stated, works great, quick ship had tiller up and running in no time at all."
5,Fantastic - Miss Streisand on the best!!!,"This 4 CD Box is Miss Streisand on the best. Your voice is amazing, fantastic. CD n3 ""the 70's"" is pure magic..."
5,hypnotic music,"I heard them play the songs of this CD at the Kennedy Center and the sounds are spectacular. Musical instruments create the sounds of wind echoing across mountains, running water, and birds. Will take you far and away ...."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER,This garbage sticks to the phone and you have to pry it off and that scratches the phone and this is supposed to be the easy removal feature.
4,glass lid,"This glass lid, for Berndes 10-1/4 inch square frying pan works well, but, is made of glass."
2,Too mellow,"Its not a great CD compared to many others from their past..Its very mellow and has no upbeat songs to compare to Volare or Bamboleo, which of course would be difficult to top.I was a bit dissapointed - there's just no highs and lows on the CD."
3,"Some catchy, others goofy and disappointing","I realize the Gipsy Kings are mostly about the sound, and about the gypsy rumba flamenca. Their incorporation of reggae into their repetoire is great. But man, their lyrics do bite. Los Gitanos...llevan pena. No saben...boo hoo.Los Reyes Gitanos deben llevar pena en la mitad de las canciones en este disco. They could have given a much better effort"
3,Gipsie Kings - Pasajero,quality of the recording is not very good. Would not purchase another CD from this company.
1,Pasajero,"I was very disappointed in the latest CD from The Gipsy Kings. I have most of their CD's and have enjoyed all of them, but the latest one is not up to their standards. I have been at their concerts in Chicago and was moved to tears when I heard them play and sing, but I threw this CD in the trash."
4,great bag,"this bag exceeded my expectations... it was much bigger than i thought it would be, and much better quality..... the back pack-type straps make it much easier to carry across fields, etc, and it has a large storage compartment in the front for paperwork, pinnies, etc.. i would buy this bag again -- it was really a bargain for the price paid..."
4,Greatest Television Series Ever,"Its funny how I was only able to see a few episodes back when the show was on TV. A friend sat me down to watch the series, the WHOLE series... and after the pilot, I was thirsty for more... I wanted to know WHO KILLED LAURA PALMER!!! Highly recommeneded..."
5,Great movie...though not for everyone,"I fell in love with Twin Peaks, and had to see all the episodes. I rented them all, and was angered at how the series ""ended."" This is the starting place if you want to check it out. Though if you liked the film, you may not like the enitre series. Be warned...the last twenty minuets of this movie will have your head scrathing for weeks. I LOVE THAT MIDGET!"
2,Creepy,"The fur on this product is creepy and it looks really odd, my daughter doesn't care to much for it."
5,My 22 month old son loves this toy,"My son is 22 months old and he loves this race track. It is so easy for him to do. All you do is shake them up and put them on the race track. My 4 year old daughter loves to play this toy also. It doesn't finish the race with only shaking it up once during the race, you do have to shake it up again, but that doesn't bother the kids or me. It's a wonderful toy."
3,A bit dissapointed!,"Great idea, it was easy to put together, it was loud and fun for my child and over all very durable. But the run time of the cars and the amount of Batteries it went threw was the dissapointing part of it all. The cars ran out so fast. You must always have a load of batteries around.Thx Mom from Akron Ohio."
4,FUN FOR ALL,"We got this for my son's 2nd birthday and he loves it, he sits in the center and watches the cars as they race and crash into each other. My 6 year old daughter, 19 year old daughter and husband all like to get in on the action, I admit I have sat in on the fun too. This is a toy that's easy to use, the harder you shake the cars the longer and faster they go....easy to put together and great fun for your child."
5,"Noisy, but fun","We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! It is a very loud, noisy track, but our household is loud and chaotic so we don't mind it too much. It is extremely durable...my son steps on the pieces all the time and you can't even see a stress mark or a crack anywhere. The track is also very easy to assemble. I wish that the cars ran a little longer before needing to recharge (shake them) again. You only get about 3-4 good laps before the power runs out, but my son doesn't seem to mind. Even his older cousins (and his Dad!) love to play with it. This was the best toy that my son recieved for Christmas last year."
5,My 3 year old can't stop playing with it!,I bought this for my 3 year old for his accomplishments on potty training. We had some Shake 'N Go cars from the movie CARS so we decided to get the racetrack to go with it. It is his new favorite toy!
1,Not Worth it,"I was checking this out for a Christmas gift for our 3 year old son. I didn't think it was worth the price so we ended up not getting it then. However, I managed to pick it up on clearance for $[...] at Target. Amazing price - but that is the best part of this toy. It's not very much fun to play with and it has been sitting under our couch since we bought it. I may get it out and give it another whirl - i read the reviews about needing to shake the cars longer. It's just a really big toy and it takes up a lot of floor space."
2,Not the best toy,"We recieved this for Christmas in 2005, while it seems like a great idea the cars just don't last and they don't race around the track more than 2-3 times before they stop. Try explaining to a 4 year old well this car went around 3 1/2 time and that one went around 2 times so even though this one is in front it didn't really win. The track is very well made, easy to put together and take apart to store. It does take up quite a bit of room so it's nice to take it apart to store it after the kids have lost interest in a few days. We have 6-7 cars, 3 that came with it and several others that Grandparents have purchased, we are now down to 2 working cars. I just put new batteries in them and considering 2 boys play with them they haven't been abused, like other toys they have. So what's the point in having a nice track if the cars are junk!"
2,Shake and Go Speedway a disappointment,I bought the Shake and Go Speedway for my son's 5th birthday and was very disappointed with it. The cars would only go around the track a couple of times before they would stop. It is also very hard to hear the annoucements exspecialy who the winner is. Fisher Price will send you a replacement but you have to wait on them to send you a prepaid package to send certain peices back then you may wait up to 4 weeks on the new peices to arrive. I think the company should change their policy to where you can mail them your receipt then they could send you the replacement parts along with the return postage. That way a 5 year old does not have to wait over 4 weeks to play with their new toy.
1,Lots of fun,It was a birthday present for my godson. He loved it so did all of us. The only thing the Police Car and the McQueen car don't last a long time. But other than that he's enjoying it.Thank You
3,Fun Toy for the Younger Crowd!,"I bought both this and the Half-Pipe Speedway for my son's 4th bday. He really enjoys this toy. He likes racing with his dad and sister. It does get old shaking in the middle of the race but its still a good toy...i mean if you read the description of the toy, it tells you that you are going to have to shake the cars as the mid-race ""pit stop"" so no one should really be surprised....I think in our case, it would have been more enjoyable had we bought it when he was a bit younger. He still likes it tho and a month later, he still plays with it, but he seems to like the halfpipe highway better."
4,This racetrack is so much fun!,"I was so excited to give this to my son for Christmas! Even though he is not 3 yet, he loves this toy! We all play with it! His 5 yr old sister also loves it! All it takes is a little shake and goes around the track 3 or 4 times at least, and that is with a 2 yr old shaking it. Very good toy for any kid who loves cars and racetracks!"
4,Chopper's Popularity,"I originally purchased this puppet several years ago to use in my classroom. I have several puppets, and I purchased this one to model inappropriate behavior. We named him Bothering Boris, and he was great at showing the kids what behavior wasn't appropriate for the classroom. One student loved him so much, that I was able to use the puppet to modify the student's behavior. At the end of the year, Bothering Boris wanted to go live with this student; so I've purchased a new puppet for next year's class.Your child will love the softness and adorable face on this puppet. I know my students do."
2,Tank Cracked,"The tank design is such that it does not stand in the tub for filling and it is awkward to hold and slippery to manipulate. It slipped, dropped about 4 inches and cracked. Now it is useless. The tank needs work."
1,"Loud, high pitched, teeth-grating, squeaking from fan","As far as the humidifying qualities of the Holmes HM630 I have to say I'm content. It has a small footprint and takes up a minimal amount of floorspace. The large tank it great, too.What overrides all of that is the loud squeaking. I can tune out hums and other white noise, but this is fingernails on the blackboard to-the-bone squeaking. It doesn't matter what setting, but it's less frequent the lower you keep the humidity and fan speed setting. Of course, that means it comes on less often because the room humidity stays lower, and when it does come on the fan sometimes stays on longer, so you get the squeaks, but it's not quite as loud and piercing, but still loud enough to pull you out of sleep and keep you up for a while."
1,All Around Headache !!!!!!,"I bought this and was happy to finally have a tower humidifier. The tank leaked a little but I glued the area and all was well until I did what many others do and barely dropped it...well the tank barely slipped from my hands when I was trying to hold it while filling it up. Very poor design for filling as there is nothing to hold onto. Anyways, it slipped sideways and shattered. Seriously, the tank must be made of the worst possible plastic!!! So I called the manufacturer and they offered to sell me another complete unit with just a 25% discount because they are out of stock on the tanks. Wow, 25% off. Poor service... Actually, every company that I researched has been out of stock on the tanks for a loooong time now. Save yourself a headache and buy a different brand. By the way this tank is used for Bionaire and Holmes, so stay away from both as there is no indication of when they will restock the tanks which might as well be made from thin cheap glass."
3,"Relatively quiet, effective and will not run on high setting","I bought the humidifier for use beginning last year (2007).It worked fine all winter and I followed intructions to store it until next needed.When I installed a new filter and started it this year, I discovered it will not run on the high settings - A3 or 3. It tries, but the fan blades just move very slowly and the electric motor sounds like it's straining.I'm not sure about the A2 and 2 settings because it works fine on A1 for me. I use mine primarily at night, so A1 is all that I want.Don't know if it would be covered by warranty, but since it is serving my purpose, I'm not going to spend my time that way."
1,Looks Great/Really Loud,"This is the noisest unit I have ever owned. We had to turn it off every night, which was when we needed the humidifier the most. I loved the appearance of this humidifier and it does the job well, but I just could not stand the noise. Don't get me wrong, I know that most humidifiers are not quiet, but this one was intolerable. I usually love Holmes products, but I sent this one back. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Doesn't work year 2,"This humidifier worked well for the first winter I used it and I took care of it well, but when I went to use it the second winter it seemed as if the fan seized up and it didn't work. It smelled like it was burning. It was also a little ridiculous that it took 2 filters."
1,pls dont buy this humidifier,we bought @ cosco for like $50 and thought it was such a steal (so we got 2) after 3 mos. it began to leak and the one my bf bought because of my rave also leaked too! i'm gonna try a tabletop one next.
2,"Not bad, but some MAJOR NEGATIVES","Although this humidifier has impressive features, the noise really bothered me. I found it LOUD on any setting, even on its lowest setting. When the unit reached it humidity setpoint (I had set it to 40%), it had problems surpassing the setpoint and it kept cycling between 39% and 40% every two seconds or so. Loud fan on, loud fan off, loud fan on, loud fan off -- I absolutely hated the automatic feature and I turned off the automatic feature after about an hour.A full tank on low lasted about 10 hours, not much more. Also, one needs a bathtub or a very deep sink to fill the tank."
1,"No manual in the box, no manual on the website","I bought the HM630 yesterday. Today, the unit tells me the filter needs replaced. After one day! So I went to read the manual and then remembered the box didn't even contain a manual. So then I went to the Holmes website listed on the box, and their website doesn't even list this unit as one of their products.VERY impressive, Holmes. Veeery impressive."
1,Old product,Package looked 10 years old. Product appeared undamaged. Used for a couple days and the filter status indicator reads bad filters. As it did from the start. No reply from Holms on any compensation for new filters. A few weeks later the humidity display went bad.
2,Not worth the $$.,"Fan is loud, humidistat isn't accurate, and the tank broke after like 3 weeks. I barely dropped one end of it about 3"" in the bathtube (while filling it, because it's long and difficult to fill in any of my sinks) and it fractured against one of the seams. I can't figure out where I need to look or who I need to talk with to get a replacement tank. Has other filters and subcomponents that don't do anything except cost you more $$. I have a $20 vicks vaporizer at my house doing a better job than this thing."
2,Holmes U Tower Humidifier,"Not great for medium sized rooms. We had a medium sized bedroom and the thing never seemed to work well.If you like white noise, which I do, then you'll like the noise level. Eventually the humidifier stopped working. We threw it out recently after owning it for less than 2 years."
2,Holmes HM630-U Tower Humidifier,"I'm not happy. The filter needed changing one day out of the box. We have soft water so this should have lasted a while. Difficult to hang on to when filling, have to hold it like a baby. Does put out the air though and fits about anywhere."
2,Very unsatisfied,"Just bought this thing...filled it up once - worked great - had to fill it up again and it's so awkward to hold - it slipped and cracked completely. Called to order a replacement tank and they don't even have any!!!! So, basically I threw all my money out the window! Very upset. They said to call back in two weeks to try to order the part?"
1,This is why Amazon should allow zero-star ratings,"The handle for the tank is on the wrong end, so to fill it and screw the cap back on you need to be a member of Cirque de Soleil.The machine has the longevity of an ice cube in a blast furnace -- which is to say, none at all. Less than two months after purchasing it, the motor runs but it is no longer pushing humidity into the room.Save your money. A dehumidifier would put more moisture into the air than this cheap contraption."
1,Poor tank design,"The tank does not come with a handle and is virtually impossible to fill (you can't set the tank down while filling, either). I contacted customer service 4 times and so far they have not been able to rectify the situation."
4,works for me....,"I guess am one of the few that got lucky with this unit; there seem to be a number of legitimate complaints but I had a different experience so I'll just add that here:I used this unit daily during two winters 2008/2009 where I had a pellet stove heater that dried things out to less than 20% humidity. I ran the Holmes humidifier 24/7 both years and had no problems with it.I did not use any of the automatic settings - just turned it on and set to high. It would get the humidity up to about 28%-32% in an open floorplan area of about 700 sq ft.I had a large, deep washroom sink where I could fill the tank fairly easily. I agree with the negative reviews that this would be very awkward to fill otherwise due to the design of the tank.I've used other humidifiers in the past and this is the first one to stay clean and mold free.I have hard water - no issues of any kind there.Conclusion: I found the unit reliable, performed as advertised and I feel fortunate that it has worked well for me."
4,"Good features, but loud","Pros:- displays humidity all the time- variable speed settings. 3 manual and 3 auto speed.- tower design does not take up too much space.- easy to add water and change filter.Cons:- due to the size (length) of the tank, you do need a deep sink to add water. I use the bath tub.- the fan is loud even at lowest setting.- uses two filters."
2,"Nice unit, terrible customer service","I bought this humidifier at the beginning of November as the weather began to getting colder and the humidity level dropped. On the third night while filling the water tank, it slipped from my hands and fell inside of the bathtub shattering into a dozen pieces. I have been in touch with Holmes customer service and both by phone and e-mail. The person on the phone told me the replacement tanks were back ordered until after Christmas and the person who corresponded with me by e-mail stated that it was December 14th. I continue to correspond by e-mail to see if the item has arrived, but I only receive ""canned"" responses from their customer service folks. The unit worked great for the first two nights I used it, but as of now, I'm out over $70 (with shipping) with a humidifier I can't use."
1,"Never buy from Promax Commerce, Never trust amazon sellers, Awaful service","Did not receive the order within promised date.Awaful, be careful, never buy with ProMax Commerce, infact never buy in amazon itself since he is ultimately responsible.Charged $18.13 for shipping a $59.27 item (humidifier)Read invoice below:Holmes HM630-U Tower HumidifierSold by: ProMax CommerceCondition: newQuantity: 1$59.27 eachItem subtotal: $59.27Item Subtotal : $59.27Shipping & Handling : $18.13"
1,Disappointed,"Bought this unit from a local home improvement store. Loved it on day one... Quiet and it used a lot of water meaning it was putting that water in the air as designed. By day two, the fan is now extremely loud on all three speed settings. So loud that we have to turn theTV way up and we can still hear it. It doesn't sound like it will last much longer. I can't comment on the filter life or longevity of the unit. I will be returning it tomorrow (day three). I would not recommend this unit and I will not buy another from this manufacturer."
1,do not buy,"I bought a Sunbeam cool mist humidifier and to fill the thing you have to turn the tank upside down and remove the cap. No problem, then put the cap back on and return it to its upright position, easy, except its slippery when wet and if you drop the hard plactic tank on the edge of the sink and put a crack in it you cant replace it because they no longer are available. NO LONGER AVAILABLE. I have had mine a week. $66.00 down the drain. I wont buy another Sunbeam product."
2,"Broken Tank, AGAIN!!","This is the 2nd time that the tank broke in the bath tub...MY FAULT--- BUT this time there are no replacement tanks available, that I could find.I'm not buying a whole machine when all I need is a tank!!BAD DESIGN, flimsy.How can they sell these everywhere without replacement parts??????????"
4,"Quality humidifier, no complaints","We have 2 of these. One is having a little trouble with the humidistat, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.For those complaining about the awkwardness of filling the container...well it's a whole lot better than bringing water TO the humidifier, which many units require as they have no removeable container.Filters are cheap and a snap to replace, unit is quite easy to clean.Noise is not an issue unless you are sitting on top of it."
2,Flimsy,"Was very excited for this product to put around the cage and hopefully keep the dogs out. Unfortunately the velcro stickers won't hold (velcro works, stickers don't) and the product is rather flimsy so won't keep the dogs out after all."
3,"Ok, but teeth are flipped inward?","This toy is alright and my son likes to be chased and ""bitten"" with it. But the teeth are kind of flipped inward and point towards the opposite side of the mouth instead of down. They're plastic and can't be bent or straightened. The alligator's jaws are also made with a stiff material so that they stay straight, which I don't really like because when I ""bite"" my son with it I can't really grab him through the alligator mouth. Overall it's an ok hand puppet, but not a must-have."
4,Where everything starts to come into view.,"Mike Carey, Lucifer: A Dalliance with the Damned (Vertigo, 2002)And now it all opens up. Well, at least, it opens up a whole lot of new cans of worms. All the threads from issues one and two tie themselves together, but in classic Sandman tradition, there are far more threads involved in this knot than we ever saw coming. That's one of the things that made Sandman so wonderful, and Carey continues on in the tradition: nothing exists solely to advance the plot, but every action a character takes, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, has an effect somewhere else. A lot like life, really. I'm really looking forward to volume 4 (which is sitting here waiting for me to read it, which will happen soon after I finish writing this). ****"
5,Great series! Recommended to fantasy and mythology fans,"I have read the first three books of Mike Carey's Lucifer, and A Dalliance with the Damned is the best so far. (Can't wait for the next volumes).This is a great fantasy-mythology series that involves angels, demons and biblical characters such as Michael, Eve, Lilith and, of course, Lucifer! Carey really knows to write, the drawing is great too.I recommend you to read books 1 & 2 and Neil Gaiman's Sandman Season of Mists first. That's the way to get the whole thing. You won't be dissapointed."
2,lacking,"I have both me Leah and read her book. I met her on two occasions at conferences I attended. I also read her book. The book does look into the horrors that I know are part of the struggle with the 'demon'. However, I question the sincerity in the author. Due to the reception I received from her at both encounters, I question the sincerity of her attempts and wonder if it isn't all a grasp at further fame."
1,POOR,I was not impressed at all. The book is a far cry from the truth it seems. Knowing this girl through college I believe this was a stretch to continue fame!
3,Shalimar Terracotta,"Just didn't smell as good as I hoped it would, it is just OK. I had no idea what this fragrance smelled like but I took a chance because I usually love their other fragrances like Shalimar."
2,Shipwrecked-More of a Text book than a Page Turner,"This is more of a history lesson than a novel for kids. I thought that the book would be about a Japanese boy and his adventures, but there were too many names of boats,captains, and dates to make it interesting to read. You felt like it was a book they assign you in school for a test."
5,A biography that reads like fiction!,"Rhoda Blumberg does a fantastic job of telling the story of fourteen-year-old Manjiro's life. He was rescued with a bunch of shipwrecked fishermen. In those days Japan did not allow foreigners into Japan. Japanese who had left Japan were not allowed back in.Manjiro was rescued by an American whaling ship, taken to Hawaii, and then to New England by the ship owner. What happened to him then sounds so fantastic, it is hard to believe it is all true.The author uses Manjiro's drawings and authentic photographs of the time. It is amazing to think how much difference Commodore Perry's visit to Japan made in the lives of the people.This book is sure to catch the fancy of the young biography readers."
1,gave up on this one.....,Way noisy. Had the old version of this humidifier and it was silent. This was loud. returned it twice.
1,Very noisy!,"Extremely noisy, too little moist even on ""high"", cheapy looking and too much work to just simply fill it up with water after each use. The bottom part fills up with water that doesn't evaporate and you have to always change that water and clean that bottom piece up very good because it gets nasty dirty!!!!!!DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!"
2,Too loud - but does the job,"I bought this from a local retailer - but same model. The humidifier was pretty loud - similar to a previous poster - it sounded like a heavy rainfall - and that was on ""low"" - and I can sleep through nearly anything.I did like how you could turn it on/off and adjust the level of humity. I cannot comment on the cleaning of the product because my husband did it.Like the title says, it is loud, but it does the job. We ran the humidifier in our bedroom when we got home from work and then turned it off when we went to bed. We used it for @ 1 month to see if the noise level would get any better, but it didn't. So, we are returning it. Other posters seem to be ok with it - maybe we got a bad egg. I'm not planning on trying this model again."
1,Please do not buy!,"Please do not buy this humidifier, it's not safe! My husband and I woke up around midnight last night to the smell of something burning. There was smoke coming from the vent on the top of the unit. My husband was able to unplug the unit just as it was starting to spark. We were able to carry the unit outside, where we left it. I'm sure in another 30 seconds, it would have been on fire. I have never owned a warm mist humidifier before, only cool mist. I will never own another one. I'm very surprised that this one has not been recalled after reading the other problems people have had."
2,Plastic tank warped,"The water got so hot during operation that the plastic water tank warped resulting in a poorly fitting cap. Water then leaked between the cap and the tank flooding the basin of the unit - occasionally overflowing onto the floor. This flooding seemed to make the water get even hotter than before, finally the tank became so warped I couldn't get the cap on or use the unit at all.If I could get a new tank and keep it from warping, I'd be very satisfied with the unit. It raises the humidity quickly. I use it in the kitchen/dining area and so noise has not been a problem for me. I have contacted Holmes requesting a new tank, let's hope for the best."
1,Barely runs for 6 hours,"I bought this humidifier to replace another one (Holmes HM5082). The packaging suggested longer running time (up to 40 hours) and it looked bigger. My suspicion arose when I noticed the water reservoir seemed to have smaller capacity, and indeed even though I fill it up right before sleep, I wake up to find it had run out of water during the night.Having done some research on warm mist humidifiers, I expected some misleading labeling, but this is really absurd. Expect up to 40 hours of running time only if you leave the humidifier turned off... :("
3,Good on the cheap....,"We're on our second season with this humidifier. After some trial and error -- particularly with capping, and realizing that it has to be on full-blast to work, we've finally gotten it so that it works, and it lasts 8 hours consistently. Using the sprayer on my sink, I top off the tank, and then put the lid on over the sink, making sure there are no visible air bubbles bigger than a pea. Then I put it on the stand, and don't turn it on until I am about to climb into bed. It lasts 8 hours, and the dryness is appreciably diminshed. I especially like that there are no filters to change, and also no unusual odors. It makes a little noise, but nothing alarming. Never prevents me from sleeping. It's good on the cheap, and you can probably it up cheaper than you'd find it here."
1,"Noisy, doesn't produce enough steam",Just purchased this model. Own a couple of Holmes brand and thought this would be a good edition to another room. It's too noisy and really doesn't produce as much steam as similar sized models. I will be returning this.
4,good unit pay no attention to the anal reviews,This unit saves a lot of money from having to buy filters. Yes the unit gets hot. What do expect when the unit is heating up the water? So it girggles about once every fifteen minutes or so when the water fills the chamber below. What's the big deal? I have had this unit for two years and it is the best unit I ever had. I only clean it once a week. Great for apartment dwelling or bedroom. Compared to other high maintenance units out there I will gladly stick with this one. It does what it's suppose to do. There is no perfect product out there.
2,NOISY,"Regret buying it for my bedroom because every 60 seconds it sounds like a boiling teapot, only pours out mist like a volcano every 60 seconds, meaning it is not a steady QUIET flow...My old one lasted two winter seasons then broke...I am not very confident in the quality of Holmes Products since they seem to break every other season..."
1,Lots of Problems,"I had a lot of problems getting the cap on the tank correctly. I would fill it up in the sink and test it to make sure it didn't leak. Many times it was fine, but on more than one occasion, I would place the tank on the base only to have the water drain out of the tank, even though the cap was on firmly. One night it seemed to be working fine, but I woke up the next morning to find the tank not only completely drained, but warped out of shape! The stand I had placed the humidifier on was also damaged, apparently by the steam. I'm lucky it didn't cause a fire. I will not buy this humidifier again."
1,Buy a different model,"I bought this one because it was on sale at the time and I didn't have to deal with buying filters. Unfortunately, it turns out that the water gets too hot, or the designers placed the tank too close to the heating element, because the tank started melting after the second or third night of using it. It didn't take long for the melting to render it too warped for the cap to fit properly, and now it leaks all over the inside of the unit. Judging from the other reviews on this page, it isn't a problem unique to my experience.I went to the Holmes website to see about ordering a new tank, but they don't even have it listed, just the tanks for the larger units.This isn't even to mention that this unit is often so noisy I can hear it over the highway I live near, and it's halfway across the house from me. The next humidifier I buy, I'm going to do a little research first."
1,BUY EARPLUGS TO GO WITH THIS,Works OK but if you buy it put it in the attic. It is so noisy (knocking sounds)that it is guaranteed to keep you up all night if you keep it in the bedroom. Makes you wonder where Holmes gets its engineers.
1,How did this get sent to production?,"Problems with this device:Runs out of water within 5 hoursRequires daily cleaning of the base and heating elementWhen you run out of water, the device has to be unplugged for fifteen minutes in order to rebootDifficult to fill (you will spill water on the floor every time you refill the tank)Even on high there is fairly poor outputOverall impression - total waste of money"
1,Bad Design Flaws,The reservoir cap does not fit on easily because the reservoir itself is poorly designed/manufactured. It has a seam on two sides that runs up through the opening. This makes it very difficult to seat the cap. The company compounds this by making it impossible to replace the reservoir due to their refusal to send to PO boxes.
1,failed item,"I bought 2 units and the tanks cracked one after the other in one month. The design of the tank also made it difficult to stand alone while adding water. Overall, this item has very poor quality. I didn't even bother to replace the tank. Just find another brand."
1,This Holmes Humidifier should be pulled off the market,WE returned 2 of these hunidifiers. They both stopped working before a months time. Im really shocked - Holmes use to be a good brand because my grandparents had one for many -many years but it was a cool air mist.Do not buy this product -it should be recalled by the manufacturer.
1,Holmes Humidifier,"I bought two for Christmas 2005 big mistake.It melted 4 tanks.Holmes sent replacments fine only ""no"" tank tops.Only one still functions sort of.It can't be trusted to not melt thus spilling boiling water all over.Ergo in 2006 both are unuseable !Frederick Jamnetski"
1,Keeps knocking on your head at NIght,"I bought this piece today. Have not yet seen any of the problems others have mentioned yet.But I am returning this product tomorrow, reason being, I am somone who looks for peace when I go to sleep.This horrible piece of a machine contineously makes a noise all night, it is like someone is knocking on your head all night. (Bubble, Bubble) kind of noise.I cannot lose any more sleep on this.So bye bye to this piece.I am sure no sane person with good hearing abilities was to be the target customer when Holmes threw this gadget into the market."
1,Terrible design,"I too have had trouble fitting the cap back onto the tank after filling it. Also, the tank is terribly designed, it's difficult to hold the tank while filling it. I cracked the tank around the fill hole because I was trying to hold it.Despite this, the thing (did) work well. I would never buy this one again, however."
2,Worked Great Until it Melted,The unit worked great--until it melted. It melted right at the base and the entire tank was caved in. I am now looking for a better untit...any suggestions?
3,SAFETY WARNING,"PLEASE USE CAUTION AND BE ADVISED: I've had this product for about 5 years and had used it regularly every winter in the past. I keep it clean, and change the filter regularly. The other night, I was running it as usual, and woke up to a room filled with smoke. The water container was not empty. The unit had malfunctioned and the bottom of the motor had caught on fire, melting the housing and igniting the rug and floor. The metal base holding the motor had melted right through the unit into the rug - all that remained was a twisted, unrecognizable blob of smoking metal. It had never malfunctioned before, but just a word of caution to those who purchased this item - BE CAREFUL. It does not have a timer or an auto shut-off function. Make sure your smoke detectors are in good working order and, if possible, situate the unit on top of a fire-proof surface. DO NOT put it in a child's room."
2,Useless humidistat,"I bought this several days ago, and have found that the humidistat can't be used. It appears to read wildly different humidities based on whether or not the humidifier has heated up; the result is, in practical terms, that it's either on continuously or it doesn't come on at all.I also note that on high, running continuously, it runs through a full tank in about 8 hours, and on low it runs through less than a quarter of a tank in 8 hours, making the low setting rarely useful.It's possible I got a defective unit, but I'll be returning it and buying a different brand."
4,"good, but be careful","Excellent unit with a few quirks. Works well and warms up a cold room too with nice warm mist. Make sure you put something under it like a towel or book to block the hot bottom and not ruin any wood that you might have underneath (floor or shelf). Also, if you unscrew the white plastic handle on the tank, the unit can be more easily filled by resting the tank flat instead of having to hold it the whole time."
4,"Great product, except a bit pricey","I work with a community theater doing setup for show. These light packs were a great addition to the lighting gear. My only two complaints are the little clear plastic LCD cover is barely glued on and easy to break out if you grab it in the wrong place. Then it's real pain to fix it. The second complaint is the price. This pack is one of few that I can find that allows 10 Amps per channel with 20A max overall. It's common to find 5 A with 15A max. When you're running 750W or 1000W bulbs for stage lighting, you need more than the 5A packs can handle. Other than those two items, these packs work great for controlling lights and seem to be a robust product."
5,Brought back memories,"This CD was purchased as a Christmas gift for my aunt who was married in 1944. My uncle has been gone for 10 years, but listening to the CD brought back wonderful memories of earlier times for her. What more can you ask of a CD."
3,Surprisingly Memorable Film,"...it's not necessarily a great film, but it's somehow stuck in my memory more than many others from my youth. It's certainly very topical with the latest research in cloning that makes this a not-very-far-way possibility.It's been 20+ years since I watched it, so I'm not even going to bother with details.Zachary Wheeler is a VIP of some type that gets into a terrible car accident and is taken to a mysterious hospital where's he's patched up. Along the way he learns that this hospital creates and maintains clones of VIPs to use as ""body parts"" to ""repair"" the original. Ouch!"
3,Not all that,"I thought that this toy would be a lot more fun than it is. My 10 month old only plays with it a few minutes at a time (if that). He seems to like moving the stop sign and opening/closing the bus' window the best. I had to return the first bus that I bought, because one of the lights did not work. My son doesn't put the blocks through the shape sorter yet, but when I tested it I noticed that the triangle gets stuck and that all 3 shapes can fit through the square's opening. I hope that as my son gets older he'll use this toy more"
3,Disapointing,"We love FP toys and this was one of the toys we bought for our daughter when she turned 1. She is 14 months now and she hasnt touched it more than a couple times a week. We have the toy in the living room with alot of her other toys.She loves the blocks it came with and she is not really into trying to sort the blocks, she hasnt really figured out how to pull the wagon along with her yet. The lights and sounds are intresting and she loves sliding the window on the side of the bus back and forth.She mostly uses this toy to sit on, she did this like the 2nd day we had it. She put her feet through the hood of the bus and she puts her bottom on the shape sorter. So other than using it as a chair, it was a waste of money."
1,Poorly designed/constructed toy.,"I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it."
3,Okay toy,"I also had the same problem with only one light flashing, but after a couple good hits, the other one started working. It sounds like this is a factory problem. My daughter is 7 months old and will usually only play with this toy for a few minutes at a time. I noticed you can only fit a few blocks into the shape flap before they start getting stuck. The hood flap also doesn't fit very well. It's not a bad toy, but I think there are other toys out there for this price that an infant might find more appealing."
2,not what expected,"I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked, my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work. I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus. My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy."
1,Worthless,"My baby got this for Christmas. He was about 7 months old. Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it. My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other ""baby"" toys. This toy is just not that interesting. I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all."
3,Pretty -but baby doesn't use it,"For right now, my baby doesn't like this blankie too much. The shiny part of it is not super soft and cozy and overall is pretty thin. Right now, my baby likes to chew on chunky fabric and this is something she never grabs at. The size of the blankie is fine. It was the size I was looking for when I want to purchase a little blankie for my little one. But- overall- its a bit expensive for something that is essentially a small square piece of fabric that is never used."
5,Excellent,"M-L von Franz is a brilliant and accessible writer, and this is her most enjoyable book for me. I have read it through several times, and with each reading, I find greater depth. I cannot say enough good things about it. I do, however, agree in part with the reviewer who addresses the weakness of Jungian theories of homosexuality. I do not agree this is homophobia--I think that word is way over-used and often used as a sledgehammer against people with opposing views, but I would not necessarily argue that there are no grounds for using it here. The Jungians, beginning with Carl Jung, do seem to address homosexuality in the most superficial and insubstantial ways. This is clearly an area that requires far more effort than Jung or von Franz have put into it, but I do think this is a lack of effort rather than a phobia. But that is a personal opinion. Overall--and that weakness aside--this is an engaging and fascinating book."
3,Big Warning: Interesting but homophobic,"This is actually a very interesting book. It weaves together literature and Jungian psychoanalytic theory to paint a portrait of those parts of ourselves -- and big parts of some people -- who are animated by the archetype of the eternal child. It's actually fairly interesting, except for two huge problems. First, for everyone, the solution posed is the rather mundane: get a job, or at least DO something. Second, bigger for some of us, it is weighed down at times by the homophobia so prevalent in psychoanalytic theory. It posits that -- can you believe this? -- those with ""mother complexes"" and fear of being overwhelmed by their mother may . . . grow up to be gay! It discusses this as the ""problem"" of ""homosexuality"" although, in a minor sop, it does quote the grand master Jung that perhaps homosexuality is a functional adaptation to overpopulation. Oy vey!"
4,OEM BRIGGS PART,"This is a OEM Briggs Part as stated, works great quick ship, had tiller up and running in no time at all."
3,so so,"Handle is smaller and has a cheap feel. The rope included is pretty low end also, will have to see how it holds up, not the high strength stuff you can buy in bulk at a hardware store. But with my son somehow running the pull start handle and rope over with the mower maybe this won't be around long enough to worry about it."
4,A heck of alot better than the plush Stewie!,"Being a big Family Guy figure collector, I bought two of these, one to take out and one to keep in the box. The toy looks great and looks better than the little Stewie figures. My only complaint is the voicebox isn't all that. For a large figure, the sound isn't the best. I was expecting the phrases to be louder and more clear. Comparing them to the various talking Simpsons figures, etc., it was a slight disappointment. I don't regret buying them if for no other reason that the figure looks good. There is a picture on the back of the box that also shows a large talking Peter that they are going to release; will be buying that one as well."
2,I have Expected more,"I am a family guy fan (Duh) , so I bought ""Family Guy 12"" Talking Stewie""The Doll is nice, not extraordinary great, just nice. My real problem is with speaker,I mean I got several talking dolls (and my wife knows about them :) ,all of them have reasonable speaker. Stewie has a lousy speaker,I mean its so horrible you think the voices were recorded in a seal tin box on the bottom of the sea,furthermore in order to ""hear"" the voices, you need to click on small button on the back,compare this to Cartman talking figure, which needs only to push his hand.To demonstrate this ""wonderful feature"" in Stewie you need to pickup the doll,press the small button on the back to hear a lousy voice. How low can you go?,ahh and Rupert is not attached to Stewie very well , so it will fall off after couple of uses."
2,Retitle book please.,"Seller was great. Thanks! Fast shipping and a proper product.Maybe this is what Sociology is SUPPOSED to be about. I don't know. But the author has such a blatantly slanted view of the world that it is quite disheartening. The book contains an overly pessimistic and biased take on a great number of subjects. The tone that resonates throughout is such that you would think the author is fed up with the world and has considerable resistance to adjusting to change.I pray that the author finds some balance to his viewpoints and considers that constantly giving thought to negativity and despair is a destructive practice. I am happy to have had the chance to experience a dose of what is sociology, and am confident that chances are now very slim that I will choose this path as a major."
4,Good!,"Exactly what I was hoping that the book would be like. Great condition, and met all of my standards. Very pleased."
3,Sociology Book,The actual product I would give 5 stars but my order was sent to the wrong customer which was a little troublesome. Other than that good deal.
5,a perfect wok for arthritis sufferers,"If you have wrists or shoulders affected with arthritis, as I do, this is the perfect kitchen companion. As the first reviewer notes, it is versatile and can be used for casseroles, braising and as a traditional wok. It has a lifetime warranty, and can even go inside the oven. For me, though, its outstanding feature is its weight. It's so light, even I can carry it without inwardly going ""ouch!""I cannot recommend it highly enough."
2,Good Wok But Poor Design On The Handles,"I like Berdnes cookware. This wok is good except the design of the handles is very poor. Both handles of this wok are made of cast aluminum; NOT the phenolic handles as described (Phenolic is a strong plastic resin resistant to heat). It's too hot to touch the handles while we are cooking. That means we can't move or lift the wok when cooking because it will burn your hands. I guess Berdnes is aware of this problem, and the new Tradition series is using the wooden handles instead."
5,A worthwhile investment,"I picked up a copy of Connie Long's book from the library ""just for the heck of it"". I am going to purchase a copy now. It is packed full with useful tips and information about lining everything. I especially like how she presented making your own lining patterns. While reading this book I was constructing a jacket in which I had to add a partial lining. Had it not been for this reference, I would have not known what to do. The garment looked very professional. Every sewer should have a copy of this as a reference. Thank you Ms. Long."
4,An exciting new hero,"This book was a fascinating read. Souls separated from bodies and both kept in thrall. In a future that has little to commend it, Kurtz has created a woman who rises from what should be mind-numbing and in this case soul-destructive odds to become a hero. Sarah is tough, determined and stubborn. She has no way to learn to use the powers she is given except to use them so she uses them even though it is sometimes painful. What a gutsy woman!I wanted to understand more of how the soul cages worked, until I realized that one doesn't explain magic. In the beginning, I expected the process to be more scientific, as I also expected the circles to be demonstrated to be the vestiges of transporter science. (They could be, but in this story, they need only stand as mysterious magic.)as the climax unfolded. I had to keep turning the pages and read on into the early morning."
1,"Brust, for worst","When Brust is good, he's outstanding. When he's not, he's atrocious. This is atrocious. As an anti-God screed, it still comes over as fingernails on a chalkboard. I love the early Vlad novels; he lost that flickering talent somewhere, and this is some of the slop that took its place. Maybe it's his politics combined with his anti-religious viewpoint that dogs his steps, but I sure wish he'd get a grip. For pity's sake, he killed off Tazendra. ('nother book). Tazendra! I ask you, can the man be other than mad to his marrow?!"
4,Worthy addition to any Brust collection,"There are few fantasists who can create characters and places as fully realized as Stephen Brust. Set in the same world as his ""Vlad Taltos"" cycle, this novel has all new characters and as such may be read without knowing the other books. I found this to be one of the most fantastical and lyrical of Brust's novels. It reads very much like a fairy tale with underlying themes of familial relationships, the need to abandon old ways, resistance to change, and of course, that touchstone of many a fantasy novel, belief in oneself. Great mini-tales, tall tales really, intersperse the narrative and have the feel of actual stories Brust may have heard in his real life, perhaps from a much older relative? Many of these were quite funny and lent a picaresque flavor to the book that I quite enjoyed. Would be a worthy addition to any Brust collection."
2,nice but no cigar,"i have been a Fan of Mr. Brust's work for quite some time now, and i have read all the Dragaeran novels.however, this book is notably different, it looks like a first book (although it is not), it does not involve any of the charachters of the other novels, it does happen in the same world, but it could also be hapenning in a totally different place, as almost nothing of the unique Dragaeran universe is used.aside from all that the plot is quite weak, and quite slow.all in all, i would not recomend it.."
4,Good Background for the Vlad the Assassin books,Not to bad.... Great back ground story to the Vlad books. (I hope he writes more of those.)Ghost Wolf
1,Turn back while you can!,"This film is incredibly dull, boring, mind-numbing at times and NOT a thriller, as the cover suggests. It lacks any depth for psychological games with viewers. The story as it is could have been packed into a 30-minute short film.Now, some might say the protagonist had to go through is own journey to become a tough guy like his father, but falls sadly short and goes postal instead, but I don't see that kind of depth here. It is simply a long journey to nowhere - as the title suggests.The only audience who might really enjoy it are splatterpunk fans, who may appreciate the gory torture scenes."
2,"Generous on Theory, Secretive on Details","The book does a decent job of providing intuition on why traditional Black-Scholes framework will not work for Employee Stock Options. But then again, if directional intuition is what you are seeking, why spend the money on this book when you can get the same information by reading articles published in the Financial Analysts Journal (FAJ)? The book and the accompanying CD seem to be very cryptic when it comes to understanding the effects of early exercise. The CD is pretty much a black-box. If you think you can buy this book and explain the results of the analysis, then you are mistaken. Unless you have a PhD in Finance or a Masters in Financial Engineering, you may not understand what the algorithms do. Then again, if you had these degrees, you wouldn't need the book!"
5,Blood Heat sparks the reaturn of the Silurians.,It shows how life would be without the Doctor. The last scene where the Brigadier saves a Silurian's eggs touches the heart. It also shows very well how the Brigadier go crazy because of the war. Well done Jim Mortimore.
4,"Broad, but not deep.","This is an excellent general reference for the workings of life in Victorian England. However, because the subject matter is so broad, the text inevitably can not offer significant depth in any one area. As a general reference for Victorian England, it servers its purpose well, and can give the casual reader or even professional historian an overview of almost any subject. However, for those seeking to fully understand one of the topic areas in greater detail, this book doesn't measure up."
5,indepth and invaluable,"In doing extensive research on the basic, every day living of people in Victorian England, I found this book to be an invaluable source to my work. Of all of the books that I ordered, Mitchell's guide to Victorian England truly gives the reader a picture of people, places, and ideas that is only dealt with on surface levels in other texts. For my own work, this book was a savior!!"
3,Best for those for whom it is a total introduction,"This book does provide a useful overview, well adapted to settings such as classrooms, where readers are likely to be having their first exposure to the Victorian era.For those, such as myself, who are adults who have studied or explored the Victorian age in the past, there is nothing really new here, and the organisation and tone of writing, which assumes no previous knowledge and is very much ""junior high"" level, make it a less than engaging read."
5,This is the best CD I have heard in my life (recently),"Nobody belts it out anymore, you know, but this dude can SING. I am talking really unrestrained, BIG crooning, like Bing Crosby on PCP... No, that's not quite accurate, but dude definitely has some lungs on him. Ethereal music; the effect is that of being swaddled in silk. The Franz Ferdinand comparison is not only unwarranted, but slighting."
2,Don't waste your money or time,This book is not the same or a smaller version of the large First aid.This book was weirdly written and not helpful. Waste of trees.
4,Enthusiastically Pleased,"This DVD has three movies.(No.1) was interesting, but without the horror.(Movie No.2) started out puzzling, but toward the end was very exciting. Movie(No.3) the spin-off from (No.2) was exciting and with more action and chilling results leading to the nice twist at the end. I am very pleased with this DVD."
4,Different Take On Dracula,"This was a good movie that was not scary but a thriller that will keep you interested to the end. Some things are alittle much like Dracula is really Judas from the Bible. This doesn't make sense, why would God set such evil on mankind. I still say buy it."
3,great price,I really only brought this movie set for the first movie but the other were ok and for the price you can't go to wrong.The other two movie are a bit cheesy and even funny in some places. It is a good buy for three movies that are a bit cheesy.
3,"FIRST 2 FILMS- AWFUL, #3 LEGACY WAS EXCELLENT","The 1ST FILM, DRACULA 2000, was awfully boring and not scary.Film #2 ""Ascension"" was almost as bad as #1.After viewing these 2 films I wanted to throw this DVD in the scrap heap.However, Film #3 Legacy was EXCELLENT.It took place in Rumania/Transylvania with the back drop of a modern day revolution going on. It had all of the elements of a classic vampire film with a setting in Eastern Europe. The vampires in the film were extremely scary and realistic according to legend. The ending was good as well.If one is planning on inviting a bunch of friends to watch a classic vampire/horror film, I recommend just watching ""Dracula 3: Legacy""."
4,GREAT KNIFE,"Overall a great Knife to have, pretty sharp out the box, solid and durabale i used it to hack at some weeds and branches to satisfy my curiosity i figured that after an intense beating my knife was going to become dull, boy was i wrong it left a nice scar on my hand."
5,"Great Knife, not as sharp as I expected, but still sharp enough to do the job.","The knife looks and feels great. It is well balanced and well made. The handle is comfortable and easy to hold on to. The only problem I have is that some people said it came extremely sharp. It was pretty sharp, but it wouldn't cut the hair on my arm and it couldn't cut through paper without a fair amount of force behind it. Still though, works and looks great. I bought this one for my father for Christmas and I will definitely buy one for myself."
4,Hard core.,"It is a good knife. Really more like mini machete. It's pretty hard core. I don't doubt its ability to chop or slash or scare the ess out of a would-be attacker. But I gave it only 4 stars because there are better knives out there for these tasks. This is really just a less expensive solution. But for what it costs, it is outstanding!"
1,"If i had seen it before, i've wouldn't have bought it","the quality of the materials is bad, the paint rtarted to fall out almost right away i starred using it.it gets rusty quite easy, i don t think its made os stainless steel.the little saw it has on the handle,is only good to hurt yourself.it also doesn't get good sharp.i won't buy anything from thnat brand again"
4,Could Be Better,"This knife could be a lot better, if the blade was a little thicker and the handle a little biger. Looks great, but it's a little lite. It would be worth a lot more if they would bulk it up. last drawback is MADE IN CHINA. All in all for the price it's OK. You get what you pay for."
3,Hmmmm,"seems like some people are getting the cheapo crappy versions, while others are getting the SOG quality we know and love! could this be because they are coming out of China? maybe..but the different descriptions (in detail) don't even come close to match lmao! bad batch of machetes?"
3,Good looking knife,"Nice knife, but could be thicker. A bit flimsy for my liking. For the price you can't go wrong! Stays sharp and looks great."
5,great knife for any thing!,OK let me start of by telling you that i am a knife lover i also like to go camping and hiking a lot. If your a out doors e type of person or just a person who loves big knives and making your friends jealous this knife is definitely a good choice i use this every time i go hiking in the woods. i've had this for almost about a year now and the only problem is that the black paint is sort of coming off.i also love the multi tool use of it the blade works good for hacking weeds. The saw yet small is pretty effective on larger trees but it will take you a while. There isn't much you can do with spikes on the handle besides self defense i would definitely recommend it for that if some one broke into your house and you had this knife in your hands they probably would crap them selves and run i know i would. so any ways great knife great company great price
1,"Great prop, horrible knife.","This knife looks very cool and mean and I think it was a smart move by the SOG marketing team. Would make a great prop in a Rambo movie or something similar. But for anyone who knows even a little about steel and knives in general, this piece is plain JUNK. The steel is horrible and is as cheap and low quality as you can find. The blade is thin and very easily damaged/broken. The balance is also bad. This is not a useful knife at all in that it loses it's edge just by looking at it and the light-weight flexible blade is horrible for trying to chop anything. The saw-teeth on the back are also useless in that you can't actually saw anything with them.Don't get me wrong with this review... I'm a big SOG fan and own several of their products. (Trident, Seal Team). But the knives I own and like are made much better with much better materials. The Jungle Primitive is just plain junk and should be avoided like the plague by any real knife owners looking for a useful blade."
4,mean!,"i got this knife cause it was big and looked mean. i got it and blade retention, durabillity, function, blah blah blah, it works! it looks mean and it's big! if you clowns were even a little woried about weight and materials and manufacture you'd go to a sports store! worth 35 bucks not a penny more or less!"
5,It's sharp,"At first i thought it would be a regular knives, but no i was wrong, it was big!!, came with a case holder for the weapon, and the quality is pretty good, be careful it is sharp"
3,for the price its right,"I purchased this knife for my cousin for his b-day. Its a big honking knife so of course I had to take it out of the package and test it out. The blade is pretty solid and comes out of the package almost shaving sharp. Its is definitely blade heavy, which is fine if you were swinging this thing for your life, but I am now wondering just how much tang the handle is really hiding. I think that if SOG were to give the blade a larger curve and thereby a deeper bite on a swing it would be an excellent knife. For the $30 price tag its a good buy."
4,Seems pretty awesome so far.,"I was looking for something that I could use bush-whacking and this seems like the best out of the available choices anywhere near the price. Thicker bladed than basically all of the junk machetes I have seen. A Machete really need a little flex and I think this blade will work just fine. Thick blade, but if you put a lot of weight on it, it will flex(a lot of weight). If you want to spend $200 on something you might break, then yes you can get something much nicer, but this is a solid bang for your buck. Razor sharp blade, Back saw doesn't seem like it would saw that well, and handle seems like it would be slippery when wet. Overall though, from the other crap I've seen, this is the best of the cheap stuff."
3,Okay,As a Tool maker this was sort of a disappointment even at the bargain price. It is a good concept but the blade thickness screams that it WILL break under pressure. If you did NOT put any side pressure on the blade it would be ok.
4,Great For The Price,"I bought this knife a little over a year ago and really abused this knife. It keeps its edge alright and is very intimidating to some people. I kind of like that. I used it to cut wood, chop and split for kindling. I also used this knife to cut veggies and BBQ along with gutting fish. It is my camping and sometimes fishing knife. I paid around $30 for it at the time. I bent the edges here and there on the chopping and splitting/batoning wood. But don't care cause I can grind those out in no time. The sheath is pretty descent and the extra pocket is awesome cause I carry my Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener in it(also bought on Amazon). For beginners wanting a pretty good knife for a low cost, this is the knife to buy. I could go on with this but the other guys got it covered in their reviews."
4,Great Blade... Sharp... Handle underweighted,"Received this knife from my beautiful bride and the blade and handle are fantastic. The handle is under-weighted making the knife unbalanced, but its not a deal-breaker. Fits my hand perfectly and the contoured grip feel nice in my hand. VERY nice knife!!"
5,Great all around knife,"This thing has proven to be indispensable. It's a knife, no its a machete... No it's an axe... This thing is like 3 tools in one, and yes, I have used it for all three things and it has come out smiling. After a year of ownership it has keep a good edge. It's now looking beat up but I know it's ready for more. A MUST have in you camping or Bug out bag."
5,Awesome tool,"For most of us, life feels like a movie we've arrived at forty-five minutes late.Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!You happen to it!We r not victims !For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.;~PB"
3,Decent Knife,"A decent knife at a fair price. Its not a cold steel or other quality makers product by a long shot, but its sharp, looks cool and for only $35. it should at least see me through a season of camping."
3,Big pig sticker with cheap handle,"This is a big knife. Too big for its handle, in fact. I haven't gotten to really test the durability of the blade, but the handle is made of a plastic/rubber material that feels very cheap. I can't help, but feel like the handle might just crack off, during heavy use conditions. I expect more from SOG, to say the least. It seems like they could have spent another $10 to make a better handle, and made this a really worthy instrument."
3,sog knife,first of all it arrived on time and its a good knifethe reason why i gave it three stars was because the blade was less thick than what i expeditedand the tip chiped off when i used it all and all it's still a good knife
3,Awesome Knife But i Was able to bend the blade..,"At first this thing was amazing, I was able to cut 1-1.5 inch tree limbs clean in one swing. Crazy sharp and well balanced.My complaint is that some how i was able to bend a small portion of the blade side ways when i accidentally hit a forked branch.I don't think this is some thing that should have happened and i figure it was because of a soft portion of the steel.Disappointing."
4,Good Knife for the price,"I received my knife fairly quick. Opened the box up and liked what I saw. The knife looks cool and is sharp. Took it out for a little nature hike the other day and it worked great for chopping and cutting of small tree branches and like material. The saw that is on the back side of the blade does not work so well, but will do if that is all you have. Great knife for the price."
5,JUST PLAIN BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This knife is BIG, but not too big. Perfect for ""camping"", intimitation or just plain fun! I love it sooo much that i bought two. Why two? Well why not? The other hand felt lonely."
4,Small Machete?,"This is a rather large knife.Or is it a small machete?If one seeks the latter, it lacks the swingable heft of a proper machete. Get a Gerber.If the former, it's well made, great design, ergonomic, sharp, great feature set. Just.. big.Well worth the money, but check it out first if you can, in person, to see if it truly suits your needs."
2,"For show, not useful.","This knife came in great condition, razor sharp, great sheath etc. however fierce looking it is it carries no weight. Tried it out in the backyard, a lot of force is required to cut anything down (which is what a survival situation would call for) not good for batoning, blade bends pretty easily which makes me nervous. The saw on the back is alright, but it's a little to short to be truly effective and was a little annoying. I don't think I would put my life in this knife's hands. It has some lanyard holes to strap it to a stick to make a spear I suppose? But a huge spear like that would be impractical. Fail SOG I have loved everything else SOG I have ever owned, but I'm sorry this is a toy."
3,It's okay but not great,"The item is as described but in practice the size variation between the first two isn't noticeable while the next jump is really a big one. The vibe is okay I guess, it works but is a low end product."
2,It's okay,This would be so much better if 1. the size difference between the smallest and medium-sized one were a little more noticeable and 2. the size difference between the medium one and the largest one was so huge.
4,Three Tales in One!,"I love how complex the plots are in this version of ""A Christmas Carol."" There's the original ""Christmas Carol,"" which Annie and her friends were accustomed to performing as a play each Christmas season; there's the play Annie insists that they perform instead; and there's the plot revolving around the conflict between Annie and the other young people, who would rather put on the original ""Christmas Carol.""This is a version I'll watch again and again for years to come!"
2,bleh,"Except for a few singers I like on here, like Dido, Sheryl Crow & Tom Petty, & maybe a couple others, this looks like a waste. I'm better off sticking to making my own cds. I'm starting to hate most modernized versions of Christmas songs, they just ruin it. Ugh, just look at the artists of the 1st 3 tracks (I can't stand any of them)... isn't there something wrong here???? I might be young, but I think I'll stick to the older guys (Crosby, Sinatra, Cole, Elvis, etc.). ""Very Special"" has done better in the past, but I guess they just can't keep it up."
2,A Very Special Christmas - Vol. 5,"I purchase ""A Very Special Christmas"" along With Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"". I have only one thing to say. I love Whitney's Christmas album ""One Wish"". It's definately a special christmas album. I'm happy I purchase it along with ""A Very Special Christmas"". I definately would recommend ""One Wish"" to anyone who loves good Christmas songs."
1,The Worst The Series Has Produced So Far...,"First off, I have about 500 Christmas albums, so I've heard a alot of what's available... and the cause is good so I buy this series no matter what... BUT... This is really just dreadful... Even BB King didn't take his song any place it hasn't already been. I didn't hear any original tune that will go in my playlists. It was sad how uninspired Stevie Wonder was. Macy Gray was nothing special, and I couldn't believe Darlene Love missed the mark, when she's done such wonderful Christmas music in the past. And did anyone tell Tom Petty what kind of album this was? Sheryl Crowe did a passing fair job. So bottom line if you like supporting the cause, buy it but if your budget is tight then there are lots and lots of Christmas albums which are going to be a better choice."
4,An Overall Great CD!,"Although I am not an owner of this CD, this is a quality album(I heard it while flying on Delta 12/01). The artists on the album all bring something different and good to the table, and it gives it diversity than most other Christmas albums. Although each artist redoes each song a little different than the original, the overall effect of the song is preserved. My three favorite songs were Wyclef Jean's Little Drummer Bay Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!, Dido's Christmas Day, and Jon Bon Jovi's Blue Christmas.If you are looking for a good Christmas album this is it."
5,WOW! Powder rocks!,What a killer version of that chipmunk song! I think that is like toally cool! Who are they? where do i get more of their stuff?
3,A Very Special Christmas - Vol. 5,"It's okay, bought to complete the set at home. And that's all I want to say about that. Over and out"
2,Only one track really worth it.,"This series has been produced with proceeds going to charity-in this case the Special Olympics. Artists are mostly of the rock, rap and R &B variety, many of them familiar names. Sultry English singer Dido (herself a Christmas baby) sets her contribution 'Christmas Day' apart from the others with such a pure voice and delicate rhythms. Too much of the remainder is but noise by comparison."
2,Quality problem,"While I really like the functionality of this tool, I have had a problem with the black band on the insertion side coming off and the little ball-bearing falling out and disappearing. Once this happens, none of the bits will be held in. This is REALLY problematic because I am using this tool in very confined spaces where it is a significant problem if the bit drops out into the item I am working on.I've bought three of these items and the same thing happened to the first two. I haven't used the 3rd one yet.Other than the one glaring problem of keeping the tool bits attached, I really appreciated the functionality of this tool (enough to keep buying it even after I knew it had a significant problem... I wasn't aware of another similar tool to buy)."
1,Worst movie ever,"OMG - worst movie ever. Do not waste your money. Do not waste your time. If you have $5 burning a hole in your pocket for crying out loud, flush it down the toilet. If someone invites you to their house to watch this movie tell them you have a bad case of the cramps, you have the measles or a terrible toothache ... you will hate yourself if you sit through this movie. Bad acting. Bad story line. Idiotic rip-off of Close Encounters. It should have been a comedy - the effects are so bad they will make you laugh, although at the end you will cry because you literally just wasted 2 hours of your life that you will never get back."
1,2012; The Doomsday Prophecy,"This is a terrible movie. It is certainly NOT what the cover claims it is. No 'special effects', no real plot, just a bunch of hooey.I could see why it did not last long in theaters. The poor acting did not help hold one's attention. It was clearly evident this movie was poorly cast.Four people 'mysteriously drawn' to a Mayan temple for whatever reason! Honestly. Couldn't the screenwriter come up with something to draw these ""strangers"" to this temple?Don't waste your money or time."
3,I want to like it.,"I bought this movie last night. I tried to watch it all the way threw when I got home but fell asleep. I tried to watch it this morning. But was too into my computer. When it ended I started it over and fell asleep. I don't know if I wasn't ready to watch this movie or it just isn't for me.I can only say one thing about this movie though. I HATE THE ENDING. If 2012 is suppose to end for everyone why don't they make a movie where everyone dies. Not only a few stay alive. I know that if December 21,2012 does happen there will be some people still alive. But it would be nice to see the world end for everyone in the movies for a change."
4,hardcore and not stupid,"this band is so great. they actually sing about things besides getting drunk. HEY theres nothing wrong about getting drunk or signing about it caus its great but thats all the casualties sing about. capitalist casualties are fast and hard hitting and many so called ""punks"" wont like it because of the quality but i say the worst the quality the rougher it is. GO BUY THIS CD"
2,"good phrasebook, lousy way to learn Polish","This is simply a phrasebook and tape. It offers nothing for learning the actual Polish language, grammar, or conversations. I was very dissappointed, but it is a bit helpful for pronunciation."
4,A funny thing happened . . .,"Bailey White's book of short stories/narratives that describe crazy relatives and neighbors, interesting experiences with folks traveling through, and the adventures of daily life is a great addition to any reader's collection of southern literature. I particularly loved ""Computer Class,"" which tells the tale of two elementary school teachers who skip out on computer training to go to the dog races.White has a tender way of writing about all of her ""characters."" She notes people's eccentricities, but she doesn't judge them or look down on them. In many ways, she seems to delight in all the ""differences"" that make people (and the world) interesting. A great read. If you like this book, you'll LOVE Mama Makes up Her Mind, which I thought was even better than this one."
1,Don't waste your $$$$,Big disappointment for our book club. I had high hopes after reading the previews and thought it would make a cute book club book.
4,Baily White,"Baily White is a good writer and a thoughtful story teller. Her homy,everyday life stories are calming and grounding in times when one news story out does the last.I listen to these funny, yet calming and uplifting stories at the end of the day."
3,Short stories of odd characters and their adventures,"This collection of short stories started without any introduction or explanation from the author of the pattern or purpose intended, not even so much as ""these are unrelated stories of characters met in her travels"". There seemed to be no continuity between the stories, each stood on its own. Although some were very interesting and funny, especially the ""Computer School"" or conveyed a message, such as ""The Language of Flowers"", others simply left me wondering what was the point. Most of the stories left me cold."
3,not a huge waste of time,"i couldn't decide between three and four stars. at first i wondered, ""why am i reading this?"" because the book is really kind of pointless. but some of the stories made me laugh. each story gives an interesting perspective and reminds you of the odd people and places you've known, so it wasn't entirely a waste of time. but i still couldn't figure out why the stories were really compiled together into one book--when i first picked it up i understood that the book was a compilation of stories and vignettes, but it also gives the impression that they are in some way linked by a common thread or something. but they're really not. in the end i'm glad i read it."
1,LAME!,"I started reading this book after giving up on War and Peace, so my bar for entertainment was quite low, and yet this book STILL fell below it. I have never read a Heller book before I doubt I'd ever try again. This books characters were ridiculous and not believeable. The plot wasn't much better. I've never bothered reviewing a book before, but this one was so bad that I felt I needed to warn people. I was really in the mood for a comedy, but I don't find unintelligent writing with unlikeable characters comedic."
3,I'm amazed!,"Edited: I'm scrolling through my reviews, and for some reason Amazon says this is a review for a book by a guy named Ken Rappaport. It's not. It's for ""The Secret Ingredient"" by Jane Heller.**I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who did not feel let down by this book. I read and read voraciously, wanting to find out just what sort of mickey the girls had slipped to their husbands. Even a fake botanical name made up by Ms. Heller would have satisfied me. For some reason this was very important to me, to know what was in the herbal concoction. And when the book ended without any real mention being made of this, I was so upset I actually sent Ms. Heller an email about it. (Of course she graciously responded.) All that reading and no payoff! Once in a while a book leaves me hanging this way and it's easy to spend a few days fuming about it, because of the hollow feeling where closure should be."
2,"It's so bad, you can't look away","It's so predictable. The humor is bad. I kept reading because I hate not finishing a book, no matter how bad. It seemed like the author was trying for a ""lucy and ethel"" type book, but all I wanted to do was slap Clover. I guess I just didn't get the whole thing."
2,Not For Me,"I have read quite a few other books by Jane Heller all of which I really enjoyed. However, this one just didn't do it for me. I really couldn't get into the notion of slipping something into someone's drink behind their back - especially someone you really love. It just left me cold, which may sound a little over-morale - but there it is.Also I thought Elizabeth petulant and spoilt - I get the story is based on her issue of being a perfectionist to the extreme - but really all the designer clother, gourmet food, weekly massages etc on top of the woe is me my husband dropped a crumb and hasn't stroked my ego today/lately, (whose does ?!), made her sound really stuck up.Same goes for Clover.Poor old Roger and Bud never had a chance with those two.Then the ending with the bear and the rattlesnake ... please."
2,Lacking. . .,"Jane Heller has always been one of my favorite novelists. However, this book left something to be desired. The theme was rather ludicrous and perhaps that's why I wasn't as pleased with it as her other books. All her other books are 5 stars, this was lucky to get 2 stars!"
3,International Relations,This book has no page numbers for me to search on my Kindle. That makes it very difficult when my teacher assigns page numbers to read.
4,An Excellent Chance,"Pokemon Trading Card is a wonderful translation of the original card game. It has a very informative tutorial along with a step by step walk through. Most adults might think that Pokemon Card Game might be a simple based mostly on luck such as Go-Fish. But give kids today more credit. They are more intelligent now than ever. So this game is extremelly complex. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity for adults to find out what all the fuss is about. GOOD LUCK!"
5,Very good game. :-),"This is an exelent game for anyone who is a fan of the pokemon tcg or pokemon in general. There are a viriety of people you can duel with a viriety of difaculty levels. There isalso the chalenge of building a great deck and colecting all the cards. For maximum play, get a link cable and a friend to hook up with. You can duel, trade, and card pop!"
3,Review by an expert,"This game is ok, but I can only give it 3.5 stars; the cards in it are not what are in the actual game. Kids are taught how to play a game, that is pretty good. It teaches you how to play. I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with is that kids who play this game before the cards will rely on cards you can only get on the gameboy, not in the real game. Other than that, it's cool!"
5,Eaasy and fun but i lost it 2 months ago but best on gameboy,"Cool and easy. Too bad i lost it 2 months ago but i think it is the best game on gameboy. easy and fun, unlike the red/blue/yellow/green versions. I wished it was on n64 instead so i won't loose it. waste your money on this instead of real cards is better. i like it anyways."
5,Pokemon TCG.,first of all you don't do nothing in this game what you do is collect cards and if you had a friend you can play against him with those cards the buildings are gym and in those gym you have to battle gym leaders beat them to collect cards and medals get all 8 and go for the chance to get legengary cards the 3 legengary birds and dragonite my problem with the game is i got no one to play against and when i beat the game the game erased itself besides that there are 226 cards and 2 card pop cards you get by battle other people the game is simple uses the rules of the card game you play and set cards useing buttons all games have there rules and button pressing
4,Pkmn Trading Card Game (GBC),"This game was the classic sequel to the Win95 CD-Rom version of the game. The young adults who were fans of the TCG when they were kids would love this game. For the new fans of the TCG, this could be a history lesson on how it all began. The game follows a similar pattern to the rpg-style Pokemon games: 8 gym leaders and one final Champion. This game has high replay value due to its gbc-link compatible fighting and trading system. And collectors can enjoy the challenge of getting all the cards.My rating: 4/5"
4,Paper to pixels.,"I found that the original Pokemon titles were highly adictive and fun to play. In the TCG though, I was rather dissapointed. Their is no real thrill in catching the pokemon, and training them to become strong. All you do is build decks (which you could do in real life anyway) to defeat the 8 clubs and the 4 grandmasters (which are relativly easy compared to the Elite Four in Blue, Red and Yellow).This game does have some fun things. The challenge halls I find are great ways to test decks against random opponents. It's also a good way too get Promo cards, like Level 8 Mew. Also, Dr. Mason's devious challenge machine is a good way to find out how well you did when building a deck.All in all, if I had the choice, I would rather play with paper the polygons.Gyser23"
2,"Playing cards is confusing, but not always difficult.","The controls in this game are confusing, because you can't tell what the messages or options mean. However, if you want to play this kind of game, I recommend reading the instruction manual daily. Why? Because the rules are completely forgettable. Otherwise, this game may not be worth playing, unless you have a partner to help you play it."
2,Lame,"This is one of the worst Pokemon games ever! At the beginning I thought it was going to be really kool, but the only good thing was that I got a free Holo Promo Meowth Card. The game gets really boring after a while, and is really lame. Only get this game if ur on a quest to collect all the Pokemon games, like me."
2,This Game Stinks,The first time I got this game I didn't like it very much. Then I let one of my friends borrow it and he never brought it back. Then I got it again in hopes of beating some people. So I walked into the Rock Club to defeat the master there and he told me I had to go find his pupils first. So I found two of them and I still can't find the others. I even went on a cheat website and I followed where it says she is and she's not there! This game is really boring. I mean really. Playing the TCG in real life is way more fun.
1,I can't believe nintendo is giving us this junk!,"Okay, the card game's a rip, so why waste [the money] to buy a computerized version that ""trains"" you to play the game. If your a parent, just buy your kids the cardboard kind, if they absolutely need it, because it will only interest them for a small amount of time, before they move on to more interesting things. My advice: Skip it all together. As if the card game wasn't bad enough, nintendo gives us this crud. Trust me, I know from experience, pokemon cards are great dust collectors, and this game is no different."
3,Too easy way too easy,This Game is so easy I beat the game in like five days. Man this game is realy easy. This game the game play is fun but the challenge level is like on super easy. Go on no need to spend your money on a five day game. Go on buy something else like Skate or Die or Tony Hawk you have to try get your mind off of Pokemon and if you do nobody will tease you about being a Pokemon freak buy something cool like Duke Nukem.
5,Whoever is Board,"Have you ever been so board you will burst? Have you liked pokemon cards and games? Well now you aren`t board when it comes to when you buy I trading Cartridge. So you can defeat pokemon cards in a SNAP! All you have to do is play a Card Battle, Defeat Gyms, and win 8 medals! Plus win a Dragonite Card when you finish the game. Try to trade cards and stand up to the Mighty Dragonite Card!!!You should get this great item!!!"
3,Whut I think :P,This game is pretty fun if you feel like playing the Pokémon card game while on a roadtrip or somewhere where whipping out a table or a surface is very convient. I feel the game runs a tad too slow though
4,THE AWESOME-EST GAME EVER!,"The game is awesome! Don't let the other reviews fool you-you don't even notice the ""faults"" when you play b/c this game is so fun! I would reccomend this to anyone-even if you hate pokemon. It's that good. Now go get it!"
2,Pretty good as they go,"Not one of the best poke toys out there, but this is one worth buying, but maybe not for the real young'ens out there."
2,Great Stunts!,"Who was the stunt coordinator on this thing?? Considering the budget he had to work with, that man is a genius!!"
3,Girl at Bar,The best thing about this movie is the curly haired brunette seen sitting at the bar...the scene begins with her holding a businesscard and the french manicure is just a glimpse at the beauty you are about to behold. Guess they didn't offer her enough money to get her in more compromising positions! Grrr!Anyone know if she's done anything else?
2,Heavy but Well Made,These kitchen pots are heavier than most; difficult for older citizens to lift and safely move on stove top. Exceptionally well made. One piece arrived with defective lid knob which was quickly and politely replaced. Slow to heat but retains temperature well. Fry pan does not brown well. Easy to clean!
4,ambient electronica at its finest,"the people responsible for this recording are obviously talented composers, adept in the art of producing fine electronic music. from sub-bass analogs, percussive chiz, and smooth pads they weave an interesting ambient conception. the liner notes describe the program's sci-fi context: the listener, 200 years in the future, listens to musical transmissions from the 1990's. the real treat is the music, from whichever century the listener is."
4,Good,"The book showed up a little more worn than i thought it would be, but it showed up on time and got the job done."
3,Not tall enough,"The stand extends to 12' if you unsafely extend each section to the very end. Resting on the safest pin per extension, it tops at just over 10.5'"
1,Broken piece and missing piece. Packaging looked like taken from a dumpster.,"This item was poorly packaged. The box looked like it was taken from a dumpster and taped to contain the tripod. Holes all over the box! Broken piece and a missing piece to hold the ""T"" bar. I am unfortunate to receive such a rubbish item. I hope that the seller will see and read this review. To think that this product is one of expensive tripods out there. I am very disappointed. Fish vendors are better in wrapping the fish they sell."
3,Good Item,Item shipped as described. Would be nice if it had some sort of directions. Not the easiest to use and there are a few things on the stand that I dont know what they are for.
4,Sturdy and tall!,I am using this stand to hold up one heavy light and it does a great job. It is very sturdy and telescopes just as high as the description says it will. This is a great stand and gives you a good angle for the dance-floor!
5,Tripod stand - perfect,"I bought this stand not for DJ equipment, but to demo cameras for the security industry. I needed something that would go higher than a camera tripod and would be more durable and sturdy. This definately fit the bill. This stand is very sturdy and seems to be built well. Everything came as advertised and it went together in a snap. I don't DJ, but if you are wondering if this stand is decent, don't wonder, very good product."
5,good washington history,"This book has to do with the Whitman massecre that is a part of Washington State history. It's an excellent way to present history to students. Highly recommended for the teacher of history in the Pacific Northwest, ALL of her books."
2,Poor packaging,"In an effort to be ecologically responsible, Nestle has reduced the amount of plastic in their bottles making them almost impossible to open without spilling alot of water. To unscrew the cap, I have to grip the now very soft container in such a way that water is forced out the top even before the cap is completely off. Be prepared to wipe off your desk or clothing."
1,Disappointed.....,"I usually order Nestle Pure Life Water. I was not paying attention(I will admit that!) and picked what said Nestle bottled water. It also said brands varies by Region( I didn't realize that). So, I received Poland Spring water and was not happy. I contacted the seller(who was nasty by the way) saying I asked for Nestle Pure Life. He brought to my attention he did not sell that particular brand and that's when I realized, oops I wasn't paying attention. But, I told the seller I wanted to return the water. I filled out the correct info for a refund and to mail it back, saying I made a mistake. Not the seller nor amazon, sent me information to return the water or refund me. That's ok. I will NEVER order anything from this seller!!!"
4,"Works, but...","The only thing I didn't expect is that it causes a delay and sometimes will not allow a device to charge at the same time as another on my four-port charger. I should have expected it with a 6-foot extension, but that's kind of my own fault. Product was as stated though."
5,Use To Extend the Charge Cable for YOUR Verizon Iphone,"I HATED the short length of the charger that came with Iphone! Is Apple on drugs?? My outlets are so low on my walls I was almost in the FLOOR trying to charge the phone! THIS product is what you need to extend your charge cable! Use the outlet converter that came with the original Apple cord on one side of this cord, plug the Iphone charger cord into the other side of the cord and plug the dock into your phone. Very handy for making it long enough to reach a side table by your recliner or bed. The gold connectors are ALWAYS the best way to go when buying ANY after market connectors because they help preserve the integrity of your original cords capability. Yes I broke this down very simply because if my neice can understand what I just wrote, everyone who reads it will be able to also."
2,"Too much ammonia, not needed food recipes","I bought this book for the purpose of making home-made(safer than store-bought) cleansers. Most of her cleaning recipes call for ammonia-which is not good for your health. It talks about how to make different vinegars, which is acceptable although I don't think I would make my own. But I do not understand why she included food recipes that call for some(2-3tbs) vinegar.(Sloppy Joes, BBQ hamburger,etc) There are plenty other cookbooks for these types of recipes."
3,A Medical Mystery,"Stephen Gipson has offered fans of the ""whodunnit?"" page-turner a novel medical twist (pun intended). Mysteries frequently engage and entertain the reader as much for the setting/environment of the action, as for the mystery itself. In the case of this novel, Dr. Gipson's handling of medical issues and details that are integral to the storytelling elevate this effort above and beyond conventional mysteries.At times, I would find myself more captivated by his ""animated"" descriptions of pathophysiologic processes than by the comparatively more conventional narrative of the mystery itself. Dr. Gipson then employs his knowledge of clinical medicine to advance the narrative in directions that presumably would never occur to an author without his medical background. In my opinion, this background also serves him well in drawing compelling, multi-dimensional, and believable characters."
2,It's barely OK,"Just to be short and concise (so you can ""speed read"" this review), don't bother with the book. I might extend that to include all Evelyn Wood material. As others have noted, the simpler concepts that are introduced are too basic to have a great effect on your reading/comprehension. The more complex concepts are glazed over too quickly.Essentially, a majority of this book consists of pop psychology to make you feel good about your potential and of inspiring anecdotes from the program's students that, I suppose, are meant to lend some credibility to the concepts in this book.Its saving grace is the few chapters it spends on outlining proper methods for studying in preparation for tests and exams. While nothing revolutionary, it manages to approach that topic in a practical way, which might be helpful for mediocre students that might be looking to develop non-existent study skills.But this book isn't supposed to be about studying, is it?"
3,Close but not quite,"I read this one, and after reading the reviews here, I must say I agree. The book is more a volume of anecdotes with a very sparse amount of instruction that leaves you wanting. I tested my reading speed initially and was at 225. By the time I had finished the book I was at 397, so I did improve, but it would have been nice to have a structured series of clearly written exercises to increase reading speed rather than one chapter on the technique and the rest full of study tips. Fortunately I am starting classes this fall so I can put those study tips to some use, but overall, though interesting the book was not too helpful. I think I'm going to have to invest in the actual Evelyn Woods Reading Dynamics program if I want to improve my speed."
2,More of an ad blitz than a teach yourself rapid reading.,"Picked this book up with an interest in increasing my reading speed, but was disappointed when the book turned out to be one big ad for the Evelyn Wood Speed Reading Courses. Most of the book was devoted to informing the reader how fast and efficiently they could study, and how successful their courses are. There was very little instruction and what was there was vague. The book ended up being of negligible help to my reading speed."
3,Good but not for a fisherman,"Only complaint is there's no information on which bodies of water are fishable. Other than that, it's a decent book. I haven't done any of the hikes from it, but I'm using it as a reference to plan a trip to Idaho."
2,Confusing to read,"I was not impressed with the way this book was organized. The hikes all run on into each other. It is very hard to navigate where a specific hike starts and ends,, and calculate the distance. Hiking books for the BigHorn Crags are tough to find,, but I will be searching for others for my trip there this summer as this one is not going to cut it. I wouldn't recommend this book as your only guide. But it does provide some good maps inside that I found useful. I searched on [...] to get the missing information I needed to plan my Backpacking trip to this area.I will not buy any other books from this author."
4,Great tunes,Bela Fleck & the Flecktones never cease to amaze me with their talent and refreshing music. I truly enjoy this CD and stays in my car for any time I need my Bela fix! It will be forever a part of my CD collection and destined to become one of the classics I'll always reach for. Some of the true jazz greats!
2,Flashes of greatness.,"I have to say that this is without a doubt their most uninspired and unoriginal album yet. The first few tracks are really bad, as bad as ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" (I thought they got all that out of their system?). Maybe it will grow on me, but I think with repeated listens I will become more and more bored with it. I will say that as the album moves on, it gets better and ""Misunderstood"" is definitely the high point on the album (Too bad it takes so long to get there). I have a really hard time recommending this album especially considering their ridiculously strong output leading up to it. Here's to hoping their following is looking better for the mighty Flecktones.Look for _Outbound_ or _Little Worlds_ instead."
5,Pleasant (newly defined) mix of genres,"This was my introduction to Béla Fleck and it served me very well. It's supposed to be very different than previous albums (more jazzy) and this is absolutely well done. I find it magnificient! You should have a (at least small) taste for jazz sounds, otherwise, ""Hidden Land"" won't work for you.Not all songs are good, but what do you expect? I like most: Rococco, Kaleidoscope, Weed Whacker and The Whistle Tune.Buttom line: In my view, Béla Fleck's sound and melodies have evolved for the better in the past years. It's getting more unique every time. I like it!"
1,A Great Imitation of Their Own Style,"Reading between the grooves, it sounds like there was a contractual obligation to produce a new album. Great playing. Innovative compositions. It's hard to pinpoint why these great musicians somehow just didn't manage to get this bird in the air. However, nothing about it really inspires, entertains or surprises."
5,better late than never,"I visited Tikal last Feb. I had read about it for years and still wasn't prepared for the magnitude, the scope the complexity of the civilization it was a small part of--it is a place you have to visit and see for yourself to even begin to really grasp. When I got home I found this book--I really wish I had read this BEFORE I WENT, the trip would have been better for it. In any case, I was happy to read it after the trip. This is the single best work I've found for sharing part of what I discovered at Tikal with people who haven't been there. I recommend it--especially if you are considering a visit--but also if you just like to armchair travel...It is a nice place to go either way."
2,Evil White Dust,"Been using this humidifier for about 2 weeks now, and while it is stylish, and very very quiet, and keeps my one bedroom condo at a comfortable humidity level.The amount of white dust it produces is rather irksome, even with the filters it produces alot of white dust, fortunatley most of it seems to collect on my TV so I just wipe that down a couple times a day.. You could use distilled water to eliminate it, but I go through about 4 gallons of water a day, so thats alot of distilled water.I also do not like how there is no humidity gauge, so you can't set it to shut off when it gets to a certain level of humidity."
4,Nice third cassette,"Everything is forty-seven minutes and thirty-two seconds long and was released on October 1988. The album reached #15 US Album Chart and went Platinum. Everything charted three songs from the album: In Your Room, Eternal Flame , and Be With You. This would be their last album until Doll Revolution was released in 2003. There are a lot of songs on this cassette with it being sung by just one member of the Bangles. Still it is great to listen to. Everything by Bangles gets a B+.Side 1In Your Room#5 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#5 U.S. Billboard Modern Rock TracksComplicated GirlBell JarSomething To Believe InEternal Flame#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#1 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary (two weeks at #1)Be With You#30 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesSide 2Glitter YearsI'll Set You FreeWatching the SkySome Dreams Come TrueMake A Play For Her NowWaiting For YouCrash and Burn"
4,Michael Steele IS the best Bangle!,"Though the CD has various hits on it, the best songs have been underrated. Michael Steele delivers songs that are so beautiful. 'Something To Believe In' is a track you can put on repeat and just bathe in. To be honest, I liked Eternal Flame the first time I heard it but now it is the most skipped song in my CD-collection. How boring Susanna Hoffs voice is when you get an overdose of it! Therefor I urge listeners to pay more attention on the other Bangles. 'Some Dreams Come True' and 'Watching The Sky' should prove this!"
2,VERY disappointing....,"There R mayB 4 good songs here -- the bittersweet ""Glitter Years,"" the GORGEOUS original version of ""I'll Set You Free,"" the driving ""Be With You"" -- & ""Eternal Flame,"" which is as simple as a nursery rhyme & sounds like it was written by & 4 Barry Manilow, complete with the cliched kitchen-sink-production finale.The rest is just ... DULL, & I LOVED these girls. Why isn't ""Everything I Wanted"" on this album? U can hear it on GREATEST HITS. The girls thot it didn't fit in here, but it sure woulda spiced-up this dull fiasco -- MayB woulda lifted it up 2 3 stars.... This was a BIG letdown after DIFFERENT LIGHT, 1 of my favorite albums of all time (5 stars). Still wish they hadn't broke up, tho...."
4,Where's The Music,"Michael is a great talent, but this CD has a total of 19:34 minutes of music. NINETEEN MINUTES AND 34 SECONDS! Of the 12 tracks on this CD, only 2 of them are longer than 1:10. The CD label lies about the length of each track. RIPPED! RIPPED!"
5,Not a Religious Scholar and Found This Very Useful,"Let me start by saying, I am an Orthodox Christian who is not a scholar and has a ton to learn about the faith. That being said, the ""Orthodox Study Bible"" is a tremendous resource to me. There are good introductions to each of the chapters as well as a ton of footnotes for understanding. There are also pages inserted in the Bible on different Orthodox traditions as well as full page icons. Once you start reading, often you are inspired to dig deeper into the subject and learn more and there are a bunch of other Orthodox publishings out there on a variety of topics, especially from Light-n-Life Publishing. Is this Bible a perfect edition, of course not but it's effective and helpful and can be a great resource for any Christian, Orthodox or otherwise, at any level of their religious belief."
5,This is a great devotional study bible.,"It has informative study helps, a section on how to read the Bible, and a section on the Orthodox Church. The whole Study Bible was very well thought out. I like its readability and the commentary on the text as well as the icons. The morning and evening prayers are wonderful. It has become my favorite study bible to date."
4,Would the REAL King James please stand up!,"This Bible is literally a God send to all Christians and especially us Liturgical ones (Roman, Anglican as well as Orthodox) as it looks at the New Testament and Psalms from an Apostolic point of view along with the Godly traditions passed down by the Church through the centuries. The study aids and information about the Orthodox Church are very useful as well. The gallery of Icons scattered throughout the text are lovely. Alas, why can't it be in the time honoured King James Version instead of the somewhat sterile NKJV? I hope that a complete Old Testament along with the New Testament study Bible is forthcoming."
5,hardcover and genuine leather editions are available,"The Amazon.com entry for this book says that the Orthodox Study Bible is out of print. Actually, it is only the paperback edition which is out of print. The OSB is available in both a hardcover edition and a genuine leather edition. Both these editions include several full color icons, plus some other features which were not included in the paperback edition. Try searching for one of those two editions."
5,Great source for history and Church fathers on the Bible,"In discussing the New Testament with my theology professor this study Bible has been a concise and excellent source of information. The historical context of the Scriptures is provided, and the reader can see which of the heresies of the early Church the writers are addressing. Beautiful byzantine icons of Christ and the saints accompany the text. A must have for any student of Scripture interested in the history of the undivided Church and the writings of the Church Fathers. Some reviewers have commented that this Bible is ""not Orthodox"" because of its use of the New King James version and because the supplementary prayers lack sufficient attention to the Virgin Mary--these are weak criticisms when considering the overall strength of the complete work (and that the King James Version has been used by Orthodox in the past)."
5,Very good reference for beginners,This book is a very complete reference for a novice in Mac OS X (as I am). It has a good historical recount about the develop of this new OS. The chapters are very readable and very understable. It has a good layout and the terms and concepts are clearly explained.
2,stays on the surface,"I was looking for a book, that gave me some insights on the combination of the Apple user interface with the inner workings of Unix.This book has over 750 pages and a lot of screenshots and it explains the user interface.But I expected some Unix insights, there are none."
2,"Title should be ""The Almost Complete Reference--""","I agree with Binder on this--although I'll be a bit moresympathetic and give it 2 stars.My primary complaint is that it is too light on the insidedetails. I consider myself an expert on Unix operating systems,having worked on Unix machines for about 15 yrs. Apple's implementation is very interesting and they have done a bang-upjob in synthesizing a beautiful GUI with a kick-a** operatingsystem.From a ""power-user's"" point of view, there are numerous differencesbetween BSD and OSX that should have been covered in a ""Complete""reference. Foremost amongst these is how to use ""NetInfo""to manage deamons, printers, etc... There are a number ofgood books on general Unix admin. But, some in depth coverageof the inner workings of OSX would be nice.When I bought this book, I was expecting a real bread and butterbook on OSX, what I got was about 500 pages of mostly useless info on how to point and click through the various standard apps."
2,Too much basic stuff,"This book has a large section on AppleScript, AppleWorks and Quicktime. It needs to focus more on the OS X system and interface. Not much on the command line, not enough to learn the ""tricks"" of OS X. I rate this book as a good Mac OS X introduction for someone how does not use the Mac very often. This is not a book for the Power User."
2,Save your money for a different book,"I am afraid that I found this book to be inaccurate in some areas, such as sharing, and also lacking in technical information. Its a paperweight. 800 Pages of fluff."
2,This should be OSX for dummies Plus,I got this book in and it appears that 75 percent of the material covered in the book should be a natural for a regular Mac user. I was expecting a little more for the money.
2,Mostly a beginners book,"This is the kind of book beginners love, but experienced users hate. Existing users will know 90% of what is here, best to just go browse it in a bookstore or buy it, scan it and send it back if your library doesn't have it. Though this book is MUCH better than the quicky books that compete with it on the shelf, it is very hard to justify this kind of money for what is here. I think the author should do an advanced book for the rest of us."
1,Bad design and weak writing; good technical info,"There's nothing wrong with the technical information in this volume. What is missing is good book design and good editing. The book is unnecessarily repetitious and it is impossible to follow the outline easily without keeping one finger in the table of contents. A trained editor would have made use of the many possibled variations of type fonts to clearly distinguish main points from sub points. All levels are in the same face, same style, with miniscule size differences. Whatever happened to ALL CAPS, italic, caps and little caps, underline, and the other possibilities? I don't expect this to read like a novel, but neither should it be difficult! Or tedious! (It's both!)"
5,Very good book about everything you could ever ask!,"This book introduces you to OS X, with a complete walkthrough of nearly every feature OS X has to present. It will be valuable to Wintel users too, because the introduction to Macs is done very professional. It treats every user the same, and it does just what it's supposed to do, namely as a complete reference, in which I think it does very well. The book is also based on version 10.0.2 as of this writing, which makes all those other books written for the beta version old and outdated. You won't find better books about OS X !!!"
5,Nice book for a new Mac User,"As a new Mac User, this book is an excellent resource! I searched high and low to find something that was comprehensive enough to appeal to the more technical aspects of the OS and this book did delve into them to a fairly good extent (some mention of architecture and comparative architecture). For the most part, I would have given the book a 4/5, but ... there's a programming section! This is very nice to add to a book and it brought back all sorts of warm and fuzzy feelings of the old days when all manuals and texts dealt with programming to some extent. Nice book and a good choice for those needing a Mac reference. The book spends some time on the interface and interaction with the interface -- so you may wish to skim ""some"" of the material if you are already comfortable with GUI operations. However, sometimes reading these sections will give you insight into something you forgot or a detail you never quite knew."
2,"Not as ""Complete"" as I was hoping for...","I am a long-time and dedicated Mac user, with varied amounts of experience with other platforms -- I have enough Windows experience to earn an MCSE, but only enough Unix experience to be afraid of the root account. I have been very excited about the potential of Mac OS X and wanted a book that was a comprehensive reference for the GUI side but also had substantial documentation of the Unix side, particularly the command line interface.This book is a fairly decent intro to OS X, but its command line reference is awful. I bought the book and ended up returning it to the store later the same day.This weekend I just picked up ""Mac OS X Unleashed"" by John Ray and I would definitely recommend that title over this one."
1,The Complete Reference?,"I am not sure who this book was wriiten for. If you can start your computer and open an application then most of this book will be useless to you. Before you purchase this book look in the index for some common tasks you know how to do in OS 9.0. For instances taking a screen shot, burning data CD's, and networking with non macs are not listed in the index. Things that are indexed are in such broad detail you won't get it done following Jesse's book."
5,I can go back to writing with peace of mind,"Mr. Marich has cured my writer's block. I realized after reading this incredible ""BIBLE"" that the root of my writer's anxiety was my fear that I would never be able to get my work to the public, press or broadcast media. I know now that there are tried and true ways to get my work noticed. After finishing Mr. Marich's book, I went right back to my P.C. with new inspiration. How very unselfish of Mr. Marich to share his experience and know-how with other writers. Anyone who is even thinking about writing for public consumption should read this book. No agent in the world could do in one year what Mr. Marich has done in one incredible book."
5,Literary Publicity: The Final Chapter,"As a first time author, I was completely clueless about how to promote my own book. While many people offered me lots of great ideas about where to begin, I kept finding myself back at the same place. Step by step, Mr. Marich's book helped me to understand the need to spread the word, engage in cross-promotion, and take the first step towards getting the word out. I applaud this very important book and I recommend it to anyone who would like to take charge of their own career! Bravo!!"
1,Somewhere a Velociraptor is crying,"I'm not about to wade into the whole Evolution vs ""intelligent design"" argument, but this book is really one mangy dog. I'm not sure what background the authors have, but I doubt it is any deeper than what one could gleen from viewing half of Jurassic Park. By all means, give your child this book. Just don't blame me when they get laughed at and picked on by their classmates for sharing what they learned from it."
1,Not for Children,"I think its a shame that this book is being touted as a book for children. Especially given the supposed Christian theme. Telling a child that if they, or anyone sins God's punishment is death is really counter productive to what Christianity is all about. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,terrible! >_<,"holy crap! i HATED thsi book. it shouldnt have been called What REALLY Happened. it should have been called WHY WE ALL DIE....an awful terrible horrible story. i dispised it. this had NOTHING to do with dinodaurs and if naything was waaaaaaay 2 religious 4 me. im not against religon or anthing but im Scientologist, not die-hard crisrian. Quoting the book im going 2 die now for sinning."
1,A joke!,"This book is complete tripe,religous nuts gettng involved with science again and coming up with a laughable explanation to the demise of dinosaurs,do yourself a favour and go to the library and get your kids some factual infomation to read."
5,Refreshing Book!!,It was so refreshing to finally find a book that presented dinosaurs from a creation stand point!!! And how awesome that it paired the salvation message with it!!! My kids LOVED it!!!
1,Spread of lies.,"This book is a blatant lie to vulnerable children. Please stop spreading this absolute nonsense. Religion is hurting the world, and this is a prime example of it."
5,What Really Happened to the Dinosaurs Book,"I bought this for my child. She is curious about dinosaurs as well as creation. This speaks of both. So if your child loves dinosaur books, this is a great book to have. She loves it. We got a super deal from a super seller. Thank you."
4,Great alternate to secular books,This book is a great alternative if you are looking for something that presents a Creationist view (ie Intelligent Design) of our world. It gives various theories on when the dinosaurs lived as well as what happened to them - all of which are in line with Biblical teaching. I was thrilled to have something in print that taught what our family believes.
1,Lets not sabotage the US education system anymore..,"Giving this book to your child should is giving them a life of sullen mediocrity. What it really comes down to is, as a parent do you want your children to be better than you or do you want to see them excel your wildest expectations? Its starts with them thinking you are insane for your biblical beliefs."
1,beautiful web of lies,"this book really stand in among giants in the amount of disinformation it spreads. From the very first page, it quotes pseudo-science as fact, implies causality when there is no evidence, and then invents evidence when there wasn't enough bad science to justify their viewpointThis book clearly stands along side the bible and the Koran in the shear amount of garbage it tries to pedal.Waste of money"
4,Very Informative,Makes you want to tour Indiana to see the sights that you didn't know were there. A very good guide.
5,lifesaver,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. WE LIVE IN TOWN AND CLOSE TO ALOT OF RESTAURANTS, GROCERY STORES ETC. WITH LIVING IN THE MIDWEST THE WEATHER CAN BE OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE, HOWEVER WITH THIS SHIELD WE ARE ABLE TO GET OUT MORE AND IT HELPS CALM A GENERALLY FUSSY BABY. THE SHIELD ALSO ATTRACTS HEAT AND THUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUNDLE THEM UP MUCH NOR WORRY ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OUTSIDE. SINCE I'VE GOTTEN THIS I HAVE GOTTEN IN FAR MORE EXERCISE SINCE ITS EASIER TO GRAB THE STROLLER AND GO THAN LOADING EVERYTHING UP INTO THE CAR. IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE INVESTMENT AND I AM PLANNING ON GETTING THE BUG SHIELD IN THE SUMMER AS WELL"
5,cant stop thinking about my old game,"I never really got to play the game on the nintindo 64 becuase I never had one, I only had the gameboy, and it wasnt even in color. Now that I have an old nintindo from family, and the transfer pak, I cant stop thinking about playing the game even though it's an older, no longer produced game. I'm happy :)"
2,"Interesting idea, but there is a problem","This pak is basically only for the Pokemon Stadium game, which is quite fun for me, since I love the strategy of Pokemon. Anyway, I got this and did not know that Pokemon Gold did not work with Pokemon Stadium (1) and I also discovered that you cannot mix and match Pokemon. For example, load one pokemon into the game and then rent pokemon of that type. Maybe I am not very experienced with this, or did not read up on the product more. However, if you can get it for a low price it is interesting. But, it hasn't worked for me since I lost my Pokemon Red game...Pros:1) You can add more pokemon that you cannot rent2) You can play the gameboy version3) It is a low price (especially when you get it used)Cons:1) Not enough games that work for it2) Simply, not really much point"
3,N64 transfer pak,"Came fast, ITs almost new condition, havent had any problems...will recommend this seller to others."
4,Pretty good quality,"It took a couple of tries to get this transfer pack to work on my N64. But other than that, it works pretty well."
5,"If You have Pokemon Stadium, This Is A Must-Have Accessory!","When I got this accessory for my Nintendo 64 and my Pokemon Stadium game, I had a BLAST! With this accessory and Pokemon Stadium, you can:- Transfer Pokemon from Pokemon RED or Pokemon Blue (EACH SOLD SEPERATELY) to Pokemon Stadium and battle them.- Play your Pokemon Red or Blue on the big screen!- And more!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Our church partners with a nursing home to give Christmas gifts to the residents. A women requested a Norwegian Landscape Picture Book. After doing a diligent search I settled on this book. The title, Norway in Pictures, Visual Geography, and photograph on the cover led me to believe that the book was full of stunning pictures of the countryside, cities, farms, mountains, and fjords, The book has photographs on most of the pages, some of them are of the landscape, others are of people, a few on the visual arts. The photographs are good, but nothing outstanding. With a country as beautiful as Norway this book did not do it justice. The book was very disappointing and I am surmising that the lady who will be receiving this gift will be sorely disappointed as well. Sadly, there is no time to select another book; had there been time, I would have returned this one immediately."
2,not for long term use,We received this set 9 years ago as a wedding present. I selected them for our registry at Williams Sonoma. We have always been very careful with them but after about three years they began to chip and the non stick lost it's sheen. I wouldn't recommend these pots for everyday use at all. stick to T-Fal as I've found them to last longer. And of course All Clad has been a winner for me.
2,Just ok...,It's a good movie and shows the beginning skills of Myrna Loy in her first talking movies.
5,prisoners of hope,"Staying true to form, Robin confounds and surprises her readers in this latest addition to the Latter Annals of Lystra. The imagery and intesne plotline keep the laughs and tears coming. The characters are even richer and more potent than they were in the previous book. I was hooked for eight hours straight (as I usually am with Robin's books), and devoured each page. What can I say? If you've already read ""Nicole"" and ""Ares,"" you MUST read this book!! If you haven't read them yet, read them! These books are way more than just stories... but you'll have to read them to know what I mean. ;)"
5,Adventures and Discoveries,"I love Ares and Nicole and always love reading more of their adventures. As always, there's romance and spiritual revelations and political maneuvering and mysterious happenings galore. And, to top it all off, there's a doubly special delivery . . .I love how this series just gets deeper and more involved with each book."
4,Great for our needs,"This mattress topper is for my grandmother as a replacement for the one that wore out. We use it directly on top of the hospital bed. Amazon priced it about $100 lower than the local medical supply store, even with shipping. Remarkably, we received it within just a couple days. That was amazing. I understand they only last 2-3 years and getting a new one really improved my grandmother's aching back which happened as a result of the old one. We'll definitely be back for a new one in a few years. Very pleased with the overall experience."
1,Of no real use to a beginner,"Most of the book consists of patterns for various types of checkering. This is very nice and lets the experienced checkerer employ a variety of unusual designs.However, the book is useless if you don't already know how to checker. The photographs don't show the process in sufficient close detail to enable one to discern what's going on; the pictures of the tools are not detailed enough in general and the text is near-worthless.The text is some kind of folksy patois that is annoying and non-informative. The authors of the various sections cannot distinguish between irrelevant detail and the main points. Everything is weighted equally and nothing is well-described. I am trying to learn how to checker and after reading this book I still have no idea what the tools look like, which ones do what and how to use them.If you think you might like to checker or work on gunstocks, don't buy this book."
4,A GREAT CAR RIDE CD,"GREAT CD. I GIVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THE VOICE OF ELMO IS NOT THE VOICE OF TODAY'S ELMO. OUR 6 MONTH OLD SON LOVES IT. WE PLAY IT TO AND FROM SCHOOL. HE LOVES IT SO MUCH UNTIL IF IT'S NOT PLAYED, HE GETS UPSET. ONCE THE CD IS ON, HE BEGINS LAUGHING AND HAVING BABY TALK WITH ELMO. HIS FAVORITE SONG IS THE ELMO SONG AND THE SPLISH SPLASH SONG. IF YOU'RE CHILD IS A ELMO FAN, THEY WILL ENJOY THIS CD."
3,I thought my toddlers would like it more!,This is a good CD. If I listened to it without my toddlers for the first time I would have said they will love this. But they don't even care enough to ask for it the way they ask for other CD's. So I gave it five stars and they gave it one so that's where we came up with three!
1,Horrible Live Show`,"While I consider Bleeding Through to be a great band, and their studio music is well worth owning, this dvd is not worth the purchase. The documentary about the band is informative and sheds light on the members and how the band was formed, the live material is horrible. At best, it sounds like it came off of a cheap tape recorder held by a fan. I was hoping for something more professionally created. I for one can hope that if they decide to release live footage in the future that they take the time to think of their fans instead of ripping them off with a horrible concert. Also, the information provided on the cover claims there are two music videos when in truth, there is only one."
1,Boring,"As much as I love Bleeding Through, this DVD came as a big disappointment. The documentary drags on and on. It does have its moments, however, and is fairly informative about the band. My biggest problem with the DVD is the concert material. The production of it was an absolute joke, looking and sounding like a typical ripoff bootleg that you'd find circling the Internet. They even have a preceding introduction to the concert footage saying that there were ""NO OVERDUBS, REMIXES, PITCH CORRECTION, AUTO TUNING, or 'CORRECTED' MISTAKES in the following recording. It is raw and it is real."" As if giving it that X-TREEEME outlook is supposed to change the fact that the footage looks and sounds like utter sh*t. They also censor the lyrics in their music video; what the hell?! But it's a pretty affordable price, so I'd only recommed it if you want to learn more about this band."
2,Big letdown,"Don't buy this if you are like me and expect to see some live footage! All this dvd is, is the band talking about themselves for two hours. Could have been don in about twenty minutes, but it just drags on. Do yourself a favor and buy ""this is live, this is murderous"". Then you can actually see the band live."
4,Was great for years,"I've had this product for about six years. It's been my favorite pan and is absolutely fabulous. However, do NOT cook anything above medium heat. After six years, the nonstick coating has worn off in the middle of the pan and everything sticks to it.That doesn't mean I don't think you should buy the pan - in fact, I'm here to purchase it again because it's that awesome. Just buy it with the realization that it's not going to last forever unless you take good care of it."
2,Not in the same class with others of the ilk,"I've read the first three books in this series, and I can't say I particularly cared for this one. The werewolves are pretty silly, and not nearly as fleshed out as other authors' portrayal of the same. Plus, I just don't really care for Vicki. She is nowhere near in the same class as Anita Blake as far as being a well-rounded character. You'd think someone would have a little bit of soul-searching if they are involved sexually/romatically with two men simultaneously. It is possible to be a ""tough girl"" and still have emotions."
3,Not bad...,"This series gets stale fairly quickly. This book in particular was so so, the werewolves were interesting, but not so much the rest. I apologize for the pun, but it just doesn't have the bite of other vampire series, such as Laurell K. Hamilton or Rosemary Laurey."
4,I love this book,"Seriously though anyone who is a fan of vampire or lyncanthrope fiction needs to read this book. I fell absolutely in love with the Blood series and any Hamilton fan will instantly. Huff takes a lot of the same concepts and a very similiar headstrong female lead and goes in an entirely different and equally captivating direction. Huff breathes life into the werewolf mythology that is really unique. Truth be told, I was very sad that the series came to a hault where it did and I will warn any readers that it will bother you too. They are just too good."
4,I loved this!,"Tanya Huff is a wonderful author. I am so thankful I found this series! I have two more to go and I am already getting upset that it's close to the end of the series. I don't want to slow down. I have read one right after the other - never tiring of the characters - enjoying everything to the fullest! This book with the werpeople was very, very good. Tanya Huff did a wonderful job describing the wer's life and showing the families/packs commitment to each other. It had you cheering, crying and laughing - especially at the antics of Shadow/Daniel. With not a lot of descriptive paragraphs, Tanya Huff brings everything happening between the pages so clearly into focus. You feel as if you are there. Even after the first book, I found myself caring very much for the three main characters. Glad that when I finished the first I had four books more to go. This is a wonderful series! Don't miss it, but make sure you read them in the order they were written."
3,Pretty Good..,"This book was pretty good, though the TV series was better. The first book of Blood Ties was mostly a lengthly version of the first episode of the TV series but this book was totally different from that."
3,great ideas but not so great execution,"I really *wanted* to like Tanya Huff. And I like the storyline a lot - Vicki's handicap, Henry's ancestry, and a mystery surrounding a family of werewolves. It sounds great, tons of potential.I think I'd read about half the book before I realized that I didn't like it. I thought the writing was rather awkward - not bad, just not smooth or particularly evocative - and little things kept bothering me; the thoughts of the villain were over-the-top foreboding and gloomy, the fact that the culprit is revealed to the reader so early in the book killed the momentum, the really abrupt shifts in Vicki and Henry's relationship just confused and disappointed me."
5,Blood Trail,"A vampire book which was briefly a TV series, in which a former policewoman becomes a private eye, meets supernatural beings including a good guy vampire, and has adventures with him as a partner."
1,is this a joke? horrible on all counts...,How Corbin Bernsen and Tom Atkins (a big favorite of mine) got trapped in this turkey is beyond my imagination. Actually I'm guessing as working actors they got a solid days pay for their time and moved on. The production is similar to that of a Saturday Night Live spoof... the set design amateurish..most of the acting amateurish and the whole thing is just unwatchable. SPARE yourself the mind numbing experience.
4,Impressive Mezzoforte,"This album takes a little listening to before you really start to get into the full beauty of what these guys are performing. Tracks 1, 4 and 9 are stand outs with the rest of the album just behind. OK it was recorded in the era of synths and they are very much in evidence here but you also have some beautiful horns complementing the overall feel of a very good but under appreciated albumn.Where to listen to this album? Great for driving and just chilling out at home.Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
5,jim morrison,this book was great if your a doors fan. this book is like getting into jim's mind and reading it over and over again. And all the other book by krieger and densmore are good but this one is the best
2,Short-lived,"The quartz halogen Dual Brite security lights worked fine at first however, one bulb burned out fairly soon (about a year). Shortly after replacing the burned out bulb, the whole thing stopped working. When I went to replace the bulbs again, I found that the ceramic electrodes that hold each end of the halogen bulbs had crumbled causing them to burn out. I have an old yard light that uses the very same halogen bulbs that was on my house when I bought it almost 20 years ago and it still works flawlessly. I'm fortunate that the Dual Brite unit didn't short out and start a fire. These things are built to sell, not built to last. I now have to either find replacement ceramic bulb holders (fat chance) or replace the whole thing. My next security light sure as h_ll won't be a Dual Brite!"
3,No pre filter,"I ordered this, but there is NO prefilter.When I contacted, another filter was sent, with NO prefilter."
2,If you want some authentic live Steppenwolf...don't buy this,"This is a brand new release from the current edition of Steppenwolf which is John Kay and none of the other original members. Strangely enough though is that the current edition has been together a lot longer that the real deal. But that's neither here nor there because this band is just too slick. There is no edge here from a band that had a lot of edge in their day. John Kay still has a strong distinctive voice but it too has mellowed with age and who wants mellow with their ""heavy metal thunder""? I know I don't. Some people might say that's expected with middle age but I don't see that happening with other music legends like Eric Burdon, Iggy Pop or Neil Young. Plus half the concert consists of new songs which are truly horrible! If you want some authentic live Steppenwolf, buy the original MCA title released in 1971."
2,Unclear titleing,"The actual contents of this disc consist of interviews with the Pythons and their associates and material relating to their American tour. Its well done, and I especially enjoyed seeing what the late middle-aged Pythons look like now. But the title of the album does not make it clear that this is a documentary about the Pythons and not a compilation of their performances. It therefore is for some people not what they expected, and hence disappointing."
1,Weird,I didn't like this movie at all.It wasn't funny and it was just a strange movie.I usually like James Franco that's why I wanted to see this movie but his character is so unlikeable.The only thing I liked about this movie were the colored horses.
3,Camille,"I ordered this film because I am trying to see all of James Franco's work....I think he rules as an actor and student and etc.....This movie is not good....LOVE James and stars like Scott Glenn and others....Sienna Miller, eh?.....But if you like indie movies and James Franco's great acting.....It is a worthy buy....Patty"
3,Strange but interesting...,"I love James Franco, so I am slightly bias, but I did enjoy the movie. It was a little strange and it didn't really make sense, the end was especially odd, but maybe that was the point. I did like how the relationship between the two leading characters developed. There was a few 'Awe' moments, but it isn't the type of movie that most people would enjoy."
4,"Cheesy, but not too awful.","Was a bit cheesy, but enjoyable overall. Wasn't too fond of it in the beginning, didnt know what to expect. Cute, but more in a ""tweeny"" way than anything."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time Watching This,"Described on the DVD case as a ""romantic comedy,"" anything comedic in this film immediately fizzles out. Wikipedia calls it a ""horror comedy,"" which is half correct. Opening with a young bride's completely inexplicable devotion to a zero of a guy, followed by developments which make no sense even if one accepts this ""fantasy"" movie's absurd premises, the following 90 minutes of slog presents a terrible way to spend precious lifetime on Earth, and waste a Friday or Saturday evening.Yes, the actress looked wonderful in the red wig. And Scott Glenn's performance, as always, was great. Still, do avoid this piece of trash."
1,B and C Actors in a D Movie,"Blu Ray transfer looked decent. Film didn't really need a whole lot of surround sound so it didn't utilize it very much. I was halfway through the movie when I wanted to turn it off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued to watch the whole thing. Big mistake...The movie has a very interesting storyline and is definitely the best part of the movie. The acting was certainly sub-par with a lot of forced dialogue and very predictable lines. I would definitely rent this before purchasing just to make sure you'll enjoy it."
2,Didn't care for this....,"First of all I am not a Mary Chapin Carpenter fan. There is only one song that I love on this CD...""Something of a Dreamer"" which is the only reason I bought this CD (at a used CD place). That song is a perfect marriage between artist and song. I don't like her voice (it isn't country)and I'm not surprised that her career has fizzled....just like most artists who called themselves ""country"" in the late 80s and 90s."
5,"Her career didn't fizzle,..Radio dumbed down","MCC is clearly one of the best songwriters working today. Unfortunately, radio has had no use for thoughtful music for a long time, as everything is recycled over and over, and record companies are too busy trying to sell sex, teenagers, videos, etc. Although this is not MCCs best work, it's better than almost anything that you hear on pop or country radio these days.Goodbye Again, Quitin' Time, Something Of A Dreamer, Down In Mary's Land are well written and performed. It's interesting that MCC just released her first holiday themed CD, ""Come Darkness, Come Light"" and it's one of the finest releases this year and it's not your typical holiday fare. One of the finest storytellers around and one who knows how to emote without oversinging. Hopefully, the new administration will encourage radio, etc. to up the ante and get back to more intelligent fare. We can certainly use it."
3,Not exactly a sales training book,"With so much praises, I picked this up and read this mini book while I was waiting my wife in the hospital. The ten scrolls are surely encouraging, but not necessarily surprising enough to make to remember. Also, the ten scrolls are messages that basically can work in all occasssions, not only in a sales profession. Also, please note that you will be more attached to it if you have Christian background."
1,Religious,This is far from a sales book. It has religious undertones throughout until at the end it's finally revealed to be a religious book.
5,tearjerker,"God will bless you if you read this book,but it is never God,s will to leave your husband or wife, if you have promlems call the law, or pastor,mother in law, father in law, boss."
1,Nothing but Affirmations,"This book sucks,It should be titled ""Book of Affirmations"" instead.The first 8 Chapters are about a fictional character and how he got these scrolls that are supposed to make him the best salesman in the world.There is really nothing to learn from the story, Its more like just a background story to make the last 8 chapters in the book seem important.Then the last 8 chapters are nothing but Affirmations.The Author tells you to read each chapter everyday for 30 days.Its nothing but a glorified Hypnosis CD in book form.I think the only reason this book sold so many copies is because of it's cover."
1,Eww. Candy-coated Bible allegories,"This is absolutely horrible.... smarmy, saccharine Christian propoganda. It has absolutely nothing to do with salesmanship or business.... just a collection of feelgood, heavy-handed homily. Yuck."
1,Waste of time!,This book was a total waste of my time....Og Mandino spent almost the entire fist CD talking about himself before even touching the story of greatest salesman... I kept waiting and waiting to get something from the story until I just couldn't take anymore. I turned it off!! It was awful!!
