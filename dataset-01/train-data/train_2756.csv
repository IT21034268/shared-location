2,If it sounds too good to be true...,"I am an extremely active woman. I run 20-30 miles per week and work out at a gym 2-3 times per week. I decided that I wanted to lose some inches and gain some strength to improve my running and that's when I found this book.After following the program ""to the letter"" for over six months, I found that I had lost a miniscule amount of fat/inches and had definitely lost the fun in gym workouts.Two days per week is simply not sufficient for fat loss or good tone and does not work at all for sculpting and toning. I gave the program six months and that was enough.I'm presently using one of the workout plans from ""Total Strength Training for Women."" by Amazin Lethi. It's excellent."
2,NOT Practical,"I was really intrigued by this concept. Sadly, there are no magic tricks in fitness. This is really impractical to do outside of a gym....and a little silly to do in one."
3,Questionable,I am not sure this is the correct style for everyone. I am trying to get strong which is typically done using heavy weight and low reps. And this training is not designed for that. I think you can only get so strong with this style because you will burn out before you build up.
5,Introduction to Weight Training,These easy-to-follow weight training regimens are perfect for anyone just beginning. There's also a thorough nutrition plan included.
1,Get the right book!,"I've tried this type of exercise before and while its works very well, the Power of 10 is the worst of all these slow mo books.The Slow Burn Exercise Revolution by Fredrick Hahn offers sound scientific support as well as superior exercises. The Power of Ten is a poor mimic.Knowing this field quite well, Adam Zickerman is just a poor clone of Hahn, Darden and Hutchin's. Forget the Power of 10. If you're a lay person, purchase The Slow Burn Exercise Revolution by Fredrick Hahn or, if you're an exercise trainer, purchase Ken Hutchin's Super Slow Exercise Manual."
1,Unusable Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition of this book is criminally bad. Lists are formatted terribly, tiny exercise photos are crammed 6-to-a-page, barely legible on the Kindle's small screen. But worst of all, the exercise routines refer to individual exercises by page number... of couse the Kindle has no page numbers, so navigating to them is impossible.I can't imagine this edition was even proofread by the publisher. If you want to read the book, buy the dead-tree version. It's cheaper, anyway."
1,Based on inaccurate science,Here are three points to keep in mind:1. Lifting weights will not burn enough calories to significantly affect your weight. The only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume. The best way to burn calories is DIET and cardio. This is why endurance runners are thin. If anyone loses weight on this program it is because of their diet.2. Beginners will make gains on any program. Do not believe results that were obtained from non-conditioned athletes.3. Very slow lifting of weights is not a good way to develop strength. How many strength athletes do you see doing very slow reps? Exactly.
2,Not writen in stone!,"Having worked for a number of summers in the Yukon's hotel industry, I just wanted potential purchasers to be aware that the information here is not always accurate regarding businesses. Do not be surprised if the establishments do not offer the services mentioned, or the prices differ, from what The Mile Post publishes and be prepared!On the whole, the book gives a glimpse of what life on the highway is like."
1,Great... If you like paying for advertisements,"I could not believe that the people who publish the Milepost have the audacity to charge so much for a book which seems to consist entirely of paid advertisments. This may be valuable if you just want a phone book of places, but if you want to know anything useful about the places (meaning, any independent reviews about their service, quality, etc.) you will want to look elsewhere."
2,Mile Post Guide Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in the ""Mile Post Guide"" when my husband and I spent four months in Alaska and Canada. There was so much information that was incorrect or just left out. If we would have had to rely on the guide alone, we would have misssed a wonderful and senic vacation. The wonderful people living in the area and the amount of time we had to spend with them made our trip great"
4,Sk8er,Hey i have to say this book totaly rulz...if your looking for a vook with plans and a overall iew of skating then i would buy this book!
4,Soft and Furry,These are nice and soft slippers but they are very large around the they were much to short for the given size. I kept them only because I knew they would stretch a bit and have but still to short which is sad. I do not like slippers with rubber or synthetic soles for our doors and these are soft leather which is why I bought them.
5,"I highly recommend ""The Courage To Be a Single Mother.""","I recently took a head-first dive into the book, ""The Courage To Be a Single Mother"" by Sheila Ellison -- for my second time.I first read this book in a haze almost seven years ago, when I became a single mom to my baby girl. Now the second time around, I'm more grounded and stronger. I'm truly able to swallow what Ellison says about loving myself, knowing what I want, and moving on. I greatly appreciate her insights.If you're going through a divorce, I highly recommend ""The Courage To Be a Single Mother."""
1,never sent the proper flute,"When we purchased this through Austin Bazzar we NEVER got the right flute. The model numbers never matched, and when looking the model numbers (they sent two flutes) they were the cheap nickle plated versions.austin bazzar tried to pull one over on us not once but twice. Amazon faciliated a quick refund. All flutes are pretty and shiny but look for model numbers on the flutes. Autisn Bazzar is a rip off.We were able to find a good used Armstrong 104 for about $60 including shipping. We are much happier with that flute. Plus no one would work on the cecilio flutes in our area. They said they are pretty much throw aways."
4,"Danielle and the Tantrums ""Skor"" Big!","I really enjoy listening to this CD. I have followed Danielle throughout her career from its very beginning. Her voice has matured beautifully, and her songs are from the very core of her. An excellent combination of talents from Danielle and The Tantrums. Great going, Danielle, John, Troy and Brian!! Looking forward to hearing nothing but more super CD's in the future!!"
2,Subclassic,"Only one track on this CD really grabs me, but it's one that sticks to the ribs. ""Subclassic"" rocks furiously with great riffs and pulsing energy. Howle's sneer-vocals, ""Is he done with that girl?"" reverberate. ""Hello Kitty"" musically works the same vein with some great thunder-rock, but the lyrics aren't memorable, ""You might be into something."" Some of the other tracks are truly bad like the country-flavored ""Let the Angels Commit"" that sounds like the remains of several country throwaways. ""Cut a Rug"" sounds like an 80s band from Australia. ""Karaoke"" is so trite that it sounds like a comedy song that isn't funny. I wouldn't spend a lot to get this CD unless Danielle's a personal friend, but ""Subclassic"" warrants a search for die-hard rock n' rollers. Enjoy!"
3,Timeline Review,"The Author's investigations into quantum time travel, and into 14th Century France were very interesting. Creighton always goes to great lengths in his research in his novels, (Airplanes, Diseases, Eastern Customs, Etc.).My problem came with the action sequences. I'd have an easier time believing in quantum foam than I would believing that these 20th Century time travelers could defeat 14th Century Knights in hand to hand combat. Great script for a suspenseful thriller movie, but not what Creighton Fans are used to."
3,"Despite all flaws, Quite a ride into the past","While the plot did not seem to develop correctly, the book was extremely gripping and entertaining overall. Not nearly as much fun as Jurassic Park or Sphere, but a good novel to pick up when it hits paperback. (don't spend the 25 bucks) The history shows good research on Crichton's part."
1,Straight to Screenplay,"I really disliked this book, but finished it anyway, hoping it would payoff. It would make a blockbuster movie, a la Jurassic Park. Lots of detailed physical action, zero character development. Definitely my least favorite Crichton book."
1,"Try Simon Hawke's ""Ivanhoe Gambit"" instead.","The worst Crichton book of the 5 I've read.The pseudo-science premise was a weak catch-all for the problems with time-travel and left much unexplained (i.e. how does going into a parallel universe change the past in the present universe?).Characters were uncompelling and some provided almost nothing to the story (e.g. the professor was no more than an excuse to go back in time). Way too many pages wasted on the MacGyver-like way they repaired the time machine.Plot was almost non-existant. Characters were chased and hacked at. They were captured and escaped and eventually found the secret passage, the only source of suspense (and a weak one at that).The notion of time travel to medival times has so much potential. Crichton squandors it. Simon Hawke's novel ""Ivanhoe Gambit"" is a great example of how fun the premise can be."
1,One star is too many,"This book is a total waste. Starts with a great premise. Ends up as a cartoon. People almost get killed but never do.Repeatedly. The book just turns into a pointless chase, with an artificial time limitation to move it along. Save your money.Save your time."
2,Disappointing,"Crichton is one of my favorite authors, and I had high hopes for this one- how could you go wrong combining Crichton and medievil warfare? The book started off well, but soon became quite boring. With a large opportunity for great action, he fails to keep us in suspence for very long, and the bumps in the character's roads become quite predictable. If you haven't read Sphere, check that one out instead."
3,Disappointing.,"Time travel has always fascinated me, that's why I jumped a t the chance to buy this book. Imagine a time travel by Micheal Crichton! . I found that his time travel method (this is fiction, of course) was plausible and well thought out. Also, his research on medieval matters was impressive. BUT the story in itself was weak and the characters neglected. Those should be the main attraction for the reader, and they were not. At least not for me. It was a very ambitious book by Crighton... maybe too ambitious for only 500 pages."
2,Jurassic Park meets time travel,"I usually like Michael Crighten, but this book is a rehash of some of his old story lines. It is like he rewrote Jurassic Park, with a time travel theme.Smart, arrogant protagonist. Poor dupes as secondary players. Stuff goes wrong, way wrong. Tedious action.My biggest gripe about this book is that the characterization was not very good. I didn't get to know the characters, all I did was see them go through a number of meaningless terrible events. But I didn't care because he didn't bring me into their world. I didn't feel like I really knew any of these characters except on a very superficial level.Take my advice. Reread Andromeda Strain instead."
3,Crichton Plays It Safe,"It sure was fun to read Jurassic Park again. Obviously, Crichton believes in not messing with a good thing. Simply take Jurassic Park, substitute time travel for cloning, and substitute knights for dinosaurs, and you have Timeline.It's still an enjoyable read. Few authors are better at mixing cutting edge science and adventure than Crichton. Timeline displays all the ""cool"" ideas and excellent research that he is known for. Still, it's a little disappointing to see that no new ground is broken in this book. The characters are very forgettable and the situations they in which they find themselves are a little outlandish. One can only hope that Crichton's future books show as much innovation in plot and characterization as is shown in the story's science."
4,Timeline-A Medeval Jurassic Park,"All of the elements of Jurassic Park are here in Timeline. Even the theme park idea. I enjoyed Timeline, however a few elements of the plot grew tiresome. The three characters involved were constantly being separated, when their union was essential. This is definitely a page turner, however. I admire the research that Crichton puts into his fiction."
2,"Good, quick read - not his best work.","Well if you are expecting Andromeda Strain or Jurrasic Park (or even Sphere) you will probably be dissapointed. The science in Timeline is weak at best, and you never really buy the ""alternate universe to the past"" bit (not to mention how they explain the way the team gets reconstituted on the other end). The history is a little better and the story is rather exciting from an action standpoint.I kept thinking about ""Doomsday Book"" by Connie Willis as a much better rendition of an amazingly similar theme and plot line (i.e. history researcher going back in time to the middle ages, having technical problems, having to use their history knowledge to survive, etc.). If you read Timeline, read Doomsday Book as well for a nice comparison."
2,Confusing premise and weak ending,"Even though I possess a science background, I found the general premise to be be confusing and never properly explained. The ending was hurried and dissapointing."
1,'Made for Screenplay' book with 1-dimensional characters,"Wait for the movie - that is all that this excuse for a book was written for.MC takes a reasonable attempt at a story line (dubious science allows timetravel - historians get to travel back to a site in medieval France they have been working and get to take part in a battle before returning to the present in the nick of time) then absolutely fails to develop any realistic characters. The 'science' is aimed squarely at the chronically uneducated and although he has obviously researched medieval France fairly well (looking at the biography), he fails to transform this into anything compelling.If you want a book that blends science with history - try Cryptonomicon by Stevens."
5,Tastes like non-fiction!,"This book was my first Michael Crichton novel and it was mind-blowing. A fantastic book. It was filled with incredible detail to the last point making it seem all the more realistic. Being intrested in Physics myself, I was farmiliar with ""Many Worlds"" theory and was surprised he included it in a Mass Market novel with such effect. It really makes you think......."
2,Pretty lame,"I picked this book up expecting to spend a pleasant weekend at the beach sipping cocoa and being engrossed in a gripping, pulse-pounding adventure. Instead, I endured a tedious, obvious and predictable waste of time. Mr. Crichton spends the first half of the book on Quantum Theory for Dummies, then spends the second half fleshing out the screenplay for the film for which this book was apparently written. The characters are flat, uninteresting and trite; the pacing is one speed - full throttle; and the plot is basically the same as Jurassic Park, minus the kids (thank God). Oh sure, there were some interesting descriptions of the middle ages and a (very) few surprises, but over all I would advise you invest your time elsewhere."
4,Hmmm....,"I have to admit, after reading this book I actually did do alittle bit of reading up on quantum physics and differentdimensionalities, etc. I'm still pretty boggled by the whole thing. Anyway, I found the book to be very enjoyable. Not quite the usual Crichton (thus the 4 stars instead of 5), but supsenseful and amusing nonetheless. I got the book for Christmas and read it before classes resumed. I didn't find it the least bit ""boring"" or ""tiring"" or ""contrived"". I also found the change of pace from the usual Crichton dinos or corporate fare of late to medieval France intriguing. I would definitely recommend it to fiction lovers, old Crichton fans and new initiates alike. END"
1,Lacks of originality,"The use of Quantum Multiverses to travel back in time has been widely used in Sci-fi literature for decades. I cannot see the originality of this story, because it contains the usual time-travel paradoxes and similar topics. And as other readers have noted, it turns out to be just another adventures book once the time travel is made. The diagrams are classical in Chichton books and very explanatory, that's true. Year-lights away in quality and imagination from Andromeda Strain's, his best novel ever. For a very good novel on multiverses, better read 'What A Mad Universe', by Fredric Brown."
5,Crichton does it again,"Timeline is an intense race against the clock. It is suspenseful and thilling. It is plotted well enough and the pace is blistering. What this book is not, is literature. Moreover, anyone who reads a Michael Crichton book expecting literature needs to fault themselves and not the writer.In this soon-to-be movie (one can only hope) a rag tag team of archeologists visit the 14th century in hopes of saving one of their own, who is unexpectedly trapped in the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, they only have 37 hours to locate and rescue him.If books about time travel or the Middle Ages interest you, be sure not to miss Timeline."
3,Same old same old,"Boy, does Cricton frustrate me. In Timeline, I see the flat, repeated characters; The same basic plot (billionare plays God to create a richman's playground); The same dire results. Heck, substitute ""knights"" for ""raptors"" and Timeline becomes Jurassic Park.But doggone it... both books are immensely pleasurable reads. I cranked through Timeline in an all-nighter on the Amtrak AutoTrain. Simply couldn't put it down. Crichton frustrates me because he is a severely limited writer with an absolutely breathtaking gift for coming up with great ideas. And yes, I could almost envision the screenplay in my head. This is simply a perfect book for a summer blockbuster film. Shucks, I could cast the thing right now: Brendan Frasier, Jeremy Piven, Kelly Preston, Michael Ironsides, Jason Issacs, and David Clennon as the professor. Done. When do we start filming?"
2,Not good enough...,"First of all, I like Crichton. His books are well researched with excellent backup of technologial knowledge. Jurassia Park, Air Frame, Disclosure are my favourite. But Timeline... if it is a movie, it's just an ordinary action movie. Sorry, it's not an A grade one. Just sort of B grade or even C grade.Many writers have written about time travelling. So no big deal. Crichton still has done a great job in introducing the theory of time travelling. It is the best part. However, when the main characters jump into the past, this techno thriller suddenly turns into an ordinary action movie with people going there, leaving here, meeting someone, fighting someone, etc. The main part becomes the boring part.If you have time, try other Crichton's books."
2,Disappointing,"Very ambitious, but underperforming. The idea of melding high tech with the past worked in Jurassic Park, but it does not work in Timeline. A book about quantum physics, or a book about 14th century europe would be better than a book about both."
4,Timeline is a rip-roaring good time,"Being read to hasn't been this much fun since The Princess Bride. John Bedford Lloyd's narration is so convincing that each character's lines seem to be read by a different person. Timeline is thought-provoking without being pretentious, and above all fun! I can hardly wait for the movie. Hopefully Ahhhnold can play the part of Mereck."
2,Not one of MC's best...,"I bought this book because I am a fan of both MC and time travel fantasy books. But I found that the book read like a cross between a script for a Sunday night CBS movie and an AD&D adventure; the characters are shallow and the story predictable. There were far too many coincidences and just-in-time-to-save-the-day's. I'm not a geneticist, but I found Jurassic believable; perhaps the absurdity of the physics kept getting in the way of this story. On the other hand, maybe MC is hoping to flip this over to Hallmark as-is to make a TV movie, or he's spent too much time with ER."
2,A quick read.......,"Absolutely no character development whatsoever. Mr. Crichton didn't seem to be writing for himself, or the reader as much as for the movies. You could practically see each camera setup in his head. Maybe he should time travel back to his early writing days, so he could remember what it was like."
3,You were expecting Ivanhoe?,"Alright, so it was enjoyable, a very easy read, and no doubt coming to a theater near you. Michael Crichton doesn't even bother to write novels anymore - this was a screenplay, through and through.""Timeline"" features lots of crash-bang action, one-dimensional characters, goofy heroes that start weak and end up saving the day, improbable resolutions to impossible situations, amazing coincidences, and laughable romance.But if you go into this book expecting these elements and little else, you won't be disappointed, and may actually enjoy it, as I did. See if you can pick out the number of times the heroes get something like 5,000 arrows shot at them and only get nicked, and the number of times the heroes are on one side of a vicious swordfight with 20 enemies and yet they win. I lost count.Great literature? No. A non-stop, adventurous piece of entertaining escapism? Yup."
3,"Pleasant enough, but too much physics for me!","I rather liked the part of this novel that dealt with the historical...someone did a lot of research into French and medieval history. However, the quantum physics were WAY over my grasp....I just scanned those parts...kinda like I did in high school physics class.This was an interesting story with some provocative points to ponder.I agree with other reviewers....it will make a good film!Enjoy!"
2,Missed the mark!,I purchased Timeline on the first day of publication. It took the better part of two weeks to get through this boring book. Although I like most of Crichton's books this one missed the mark by a mile. Although an interesting premise the science is too remote and unbelievable. If I wanted to read history I would have gone to the library. The book was predictable and frequently repetitive. Save your money and your time.
2,Made For TV,"One of my favorite authors has let me down. Timeline has the characteristics of a made-for-tv movie. the book seems shallow and poorly thought out. I've read a lot of science fiction, and this book's storyline has been done better by others. I look to Crichton for an innovative and gripping story. This isn't it."
1,The Dark Ages of Popular Writing,"I found this book particularly fascinating in that Crichton has managed to effortlessly blend breathtakingly contrived plots, painfully trite and shallow characterizations, laughably absurd pseudoscience, and stunningly artless writing resulting in an impossibly awful insipid piece of garbage that is so bad he must have endeavored to do so as a cruel and cynical joke. Just say no--watch a bad made-forTV movie instead. Then you will have only wasted two hours."
5,This book is too short,The only problem I had with this book is that it is less than 500 pages. As I got near the end of the book I kept hoping the story would keep going. When you get a book this enjoyable you don't want it to end so soon. The story is great and the characters are very real. I hope there is a sequel soon.Don't miss this book.
4,Not his best but still....,"Look the truth is that it is just Jurassic Park with time travel but....so what. The fact of the matter is that this still is a good book. It is a little on the predictable side, i'll concede that but the vivid description of the time more than makes up for it. The only character I really got attached to was Marek. The others seemed to float in and out and seemed unimportant. One gripe I did have is that the charcters had more lives than a cat. As soon as you think one of them is finally dead, he/she pops back up again. None the less I could not put this book down. But wait for paperback."
4,Good but a little bogged down by all the scientific stuff,"I enjoyed this book but had a hard time with the scientific stuff. I'm not a scientist and enjoyed his explanation of ""How"" it could happen but a short explanation is quite enough. Fascinating characters as well as setting!"
4,An action packed trip to the past,"I found Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"", to be an action packed trip to the past. He has strong character build and desribes every scene in detail which I found very helpful to one's imagination. Yes, the novel reads like a screen-play and a movie deal may be just around the corner, but if you love entertainment, action, added with a little computer lingo then, Michael Crichton's, ""Timeline"", is a book for you."
3,"It matters, the matter, doesn't it?","This was an entertaining book; however, it left me wanting more. No, not more science, more depth in the characters and less ridiculous bad guy. Doniger wants a theme park? Not what I would do with an awesome fax machine like that.The other problem I have is this - the parallel universe would not deposit matter (mass) in another universe UNLESS it was ""faxed"" - but then again, we have to think about matter in the universe as being constant, so introduction of new matter into another universe wouldn't be possible. The theory that all possibilities that happen do happen (in the different universes), would not allow for matter to transfer. So leaving clues behind from one parallel universe to another wouldn't work. Or maybe I missed something.I did like the book, though, and found it to be a good read."
5,Great Book!!!,"I'm an avid book reader. However, i'd never even HEARD of Michael Crichton. I saw my friend reading this book and asked him what it was about. He refused to tell but recommended the book to me. Well, I read it and it was the best book i ever read. This book is simply great; unlike in other books, Crichton recognizes the fact that not all the readers have Ph.D. and has explained everything from history (medieval stuff) to science (quantam foam, photon) even with experiments. Besides all that, it has a great plot, even better expressing (writing) style and simply great and fitting Characters. I recommend this book to everyone, from the one who has never read one to the die-hard readers. Believe me, it's great and you'll not waste your time!!! Read it now."
3,Falls short,"Crichton must have gotten tired of writing this one and published it in draft form. It starts with a tremendous SF premise-- time travel back to the Middle Ages to track down a person who got ""lost"" back there-- but never fully delivers. Still worth reading (and still better than most stuff that gets published), but not Crichton at his best."
3,"It's not Crichton's best work, but it's MUCH better than the movie.","People have pointed out the flaws in this book ad nauseum, and they seem to love pointing out how terrible the movie is even more so. While I agree with most of that, I'd like to add that the book may indeed be Crichton's worst book, but it's still an exciting read that is better than what many action writers put out. I wouldn't start reading Crichton with Timeline, but it's definitely good enough to read after going through Andromeda Strain, Sphere, and Jurassic Park. As others have said, it's no work of literary masterpiece and the characters are not deep, but the concept works well enough to entertain and the action should keep your interest through the whole book."
5,I loved it!,"Could not put my kindle down! This is by far my favorite Crichton novel!(besides Jurassic Park that is) Crichton makes time travel sound possible and that combined with the huge twists in the story make this one a must read. And it's an added bonus if you love dissectimg Crichton's scientific technological imagery and explanation, and if that doesn't do it for you then the action is something you'll crave. Also if you're a history buff like me then Timeline is right for you. I highly recommend it!"
1,Too Far Fetched for my taste,"I'm a big Crichton fan - I like techno thrillers, sci-fi and usually enjoy Chrichton, but this was too much of a stretch for me. It smacked more of fantasy and role playing - something Dungeons and Dragon fans would get into.I know you need to suspend belief, but the way the time travel is presented and what happens never hooked me the way Andromeda Strain, Jurrasic Park, Sphere were able to do. Borrow from a friend, buy it used, check it out at the library to see if you like it. Not one for my collection."
3,When's the Movie Coming Out?,"Crichton knows Hollywood. He also knows marketing. When reading this book, one can see the obvious: This will be his next blockbuster movie script. Crichton's story follows a very typical Hollywood plot progression, and it will convert very nicely into a screenplay.The story is predictable at times, like all of Crichton's work. The characters have little depth beyond what is absolutely necessary to move the plot along. The role of the historian leading the trapped rescue team, unfortunately, seemed like it was written specifically for Arnold Schwarzeneggar.However, the story keeps the reader engaged. It is a nice weekend diversion."
4,Good and fast summer reading.,"""Timeline"" is a very enjoyable summer reading. Crichton is as always well-spirited in finding a perfect ways to make things turn very fast and keep the reader on the edge of its seat. ""Timeline"" introduces time travel, although Crichton baffles things a bit by introducing a well-meant but probably too confusing details about multi-universe and quantum physics (that's why I've rated the book 4-star, and not 5). Main heroes (historians working on the project sponsored by some shrewd billionaire) are lost in medieval France, fighting hunger, own fears, ravenous knights, and racing against time in order to come back in one piece. The book has several twists and interesting plots but also some unfinished schemes. The reading is fast, and when it is over, one would like to see the sequel, or at least to have a chance to read some more. Is Crichton at his best? Probably not, but he proves he can write fantastic historical fictions. I wish he would do it again."
4,Overall a fun read,This novel is a very easy action pack read. After the first few chapters the pages seem to fly by with everything that is going on. It is set in the middle ages with Knights and Castles and written in a very believable (historically acurate I think) manner. I truly enjoyed this novel for all the challenges the main charecters had to overcome. Unlike some other reviewers I do believe there was enough suspense to keep the novel moving a number of the main charecters are killed in the beginning and the main party gets split up. I won't go into anymore detail and spoil the book for you. I believe this is a very action packed fast paced intence book that you won't put down till the last page.
2,A waste of time (pardon the pun),"Although it has an interesting beginning, with an interesting scientific idea at its basis, the book soon becomes trivial, predictable and artificially long (a lot of repetitive chasing and fighting incidents that contribute nothing to the story, save for boredom), with stereotypic, shallow and uninteresting characters.Read only if you have a lot of time to waste."
2,A message to Mr. Crichton,"I have your fan until now. But this is your second really bad book on the trot after ""the lost world'. Well Mr.Crichton you have permanently lost a reader. I'm sure you don't care as this one is going to make gazillions on the movie revenues.....so maybe you should just write screenplays from now on."
1,Absolute Twoddle,"I bought this book in the expectation that it would be of the quality I am used to in Michael Crichton. How disappointed I was. This book starts off so promisingly and then falls off a very steep cliff.It would appear that Crichton wants to see this book become a film. I have no doubt that a film would be alright. The book lacks a decent plot. The actual basis of the book is sound, although some might say an overused story. I got no feel for any of the characters or the environment. I got very bored of reading this. There were a number of times when I wanted to put the book down and forget about it.Save yourself some money and buy something else."
5,One of Crightons Best!,"This book has a very interesting plot, loved the scientific references and also the medieval ambience. Very fast reading, once you get into the story you can't get away from it. I hope they do the movie someday. Thanks Crichton you did it once again! Can't wait for the next one."
2,A kid's book.,"I'm a history buff and I expected more of a history story. I had high hopes, never having read Crichton before, but I was very disappointed. It was more like watching a movie than reading a book. It was just one ""scene"" after another. And an Indiana Jones movie at that. Our heroes go from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, from one close call to another. It was tiring to read. And the characters were so one-dimensional. The book had nothing to do really with history or time travel. It was just an excuse for a big adventure, on-the-edge-of-your-seat type movie."
4,Timeline,This is his most thrilling book in years! Fans will appreciate this one. The master does the job once again!
4,Good,"Book is good. Good words. Good pictures. I liuke the pictures...they was good. Good and delightful. Me like...Oh yes, me like very good. Good story in this good book. Good everything. Good stuff. Good. Good. Good. Me like it alots. Lots and alots. More and more than lots. Its the bestest book I ever has read. Good book.But don't buy it. It stinks. But it stinks good."
2,Skip It unless you are a Middle Ages buff . . .,"The two best things about this book are the historical detail come to life, and the realistic technobabble about quantum mechanics. In a thriller I expect tight plot construction, but this book is as sloppy as hell which spoils a lot of the enjoyment. Examples: a time travel message is sent back as a warning and never mentioned again by any character. A refutation of time anomalies (i.e., killing your grandfather so you were never born) is poorly explained. A cop and doctor in the beginning are dropped without any tie in. The death of the chief exec of the hi tech firm is inconsistently cruel at the end. Overall, a long sloppy and disatisfying read. Historians could learn however from the way Crichton paints a real life portrait of the middle ages. Skip It."
3,Too slooooowwwwww....,"I have enjoyed Crichton's books in the past. The scientific world has always intrigued me, and this book definitely fits into that realm.However, it took about 200 pages before this book really started to get interesting. Prior to that, I would almost call it painful reading. The last 300 pages are good, but not great. A great concept, just not a great final product."
2,Timeline,"I thought the story was average, and somewhat predictable. The classic time travel paradox was explained as not a possibility so why even worry about it. Crichton describes medieval times as very clean, and less violent and savage than modern times. I know the book obviously wasn't trying to be historically accurate. I couldn't help but think however that Crichton was trying to convince people that scholars views of the middle ages were wrong. These counter period descriptions in addition to the primary characters being muscle bound and gorgeous got irritating."
4,Entertaining,"Timeline is a fun book to read. It is not earth-shaking, but just entertaining and, I think, worth reading.I have heard that it is similar to Jurassic Park, but I've never read that book (only seen the movie), so I really can't say. I do plan to read Jurassic Park now. I've also read some criticism that Crichton doesn't explore the concept of time traveling to any great extent (i.e., the possible effects of changing history, etc..), which is true. He doesn't. But, who cares? What Crichton has provided us with is a swashbuckling adventure story that takes us back and forth from the techno-world of the 20th century to the sometimes dark and dangerous world of the 14th century.Timeline is probably not going to end up in your top ten, but as I've said, it is still alot of fun."
2,I wanted to like this book,"But I didn't. I couldn't get into the time-travel thing, maybe because it wasn't written well enough for believability. And Mr. C wanted us to visit this medievil world of jousts and castles, but the reader just thinks it's fantasy. Sorry. Try again."
2,"disappointing, but still good","I brought this book because I am a fan of Michael Crichton. I brought it after I read the Introduction and the first few pages. At first I think that Michael can give me a picture of the future technology and an exciting adventure of time travel, but I cannot find what I expected in this book. Secondly, the layout of the story is not very good that you can tell the ending of the story after you finish reading half of it..... The last disappointment is the character, who is the major character ... This book do not have a clear picture about who is the major character. This book spends a lot of effort to descript the world in 14th Century and it does a good job in creating attactive pictures of 14th Century. However, I am looking at a scientific story from Michael, not just a story about Knight and WarLord."
2,a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court?,"It seems many writers struggle earlym reach a plain of success and then go into decline. Apparently this has happened to Michael Crichton. The book is entertaining, but the plot rambles without control. I do not regret buyg the book, but I was generally disappointed. I would give this book 1 & 1/2 stars it was an option."
1,boring,"what a pity! a good idea spoiled by a non-sense plot. the first 150 pages are interesting but when we move in the past...it is not clear because our heroes risk their lifes for a Professor that looks more a stupid fool than a professor.I read with pleasure (5 stars) the Robbery,Andromeda, Congo and I really regret because of this flop.If you really like enter in the middle eve world lets read the NAME OF THE ROSE of Umberto Eco. luigi accomazzo italy"
2,"Strange departure, not arriving in our time","Found the time travel plot a bit hokey. Plus, Chrichton excels at the intricacies of science and this book's deep-fried time travel explanations seem poorly thought out. We may have found the first bit of evidence that Mr. Chrichton has spent too much time watching movies made from his books. To many movies with easy outs that fit the momentum of the story. To find suggestions for better reading, visit Recommendo.com"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","This book was really bad. The only reason I finished it was because a friend told me it was great and I wanted to arm myself with as much critical material as possible. Well, thankfully, Mr. Crichton came through with the goofiest, most absurdly dissatisfying ending. When I was done, I threw the book in the trash and turned on a much more historically accurate depiction of the 13th century, XENA - WARRIOR PRINCESS. BATTLE ON XENA!"
2,Boring,- Evil corporation invents a time machine to be used for no good. - Sends professor back in time to the middle ages. - History students go back to save him. - Hoorah!
2,Only if You liked Lost World will you like this,Although the book has a lot of action it goes nowhere. Crichton has strayed from the great believable story telling in Andromeda Strain Jurassic Park. It seems he now writes ridiculous stories that are meant to go directly to film. Wait for the movie on this one.
1,Grade school mentality appeal,"Silly. Perils of Pauline nonsense. Weak characterization and plotting. Not satisfied with cliffhangers, ad infinitum, Crichton insults us further by attaching sub-cliffhangers to each. I browsed through the book in the public library and was impressed with the extensive bibliography. With all this backup, the book must be great. Right? What a disappointment. I doubt that he used 1% of it. Just another prop."
1,Movie in the Works!,Michael Crichton needs to stop writing books with the future screen in mind. They may end up making a great movie but are a terrible novel.
5,Only he could explain Quantum foam like that!,This book was so intense! I couldn't put it down. Just thinking about the concepts in this book make me wonder if anyone is actually trying to do it. I hope they make a movie because it would be amazing! All of the action and tense moments not to be shown up by the pure emotion of the characters! I think it is his best work yet!
2,The Lost World meets Joan of Arc,"I guess Crichton is now into screenplays, instead of novels. Although the reserach and technical part of the book is very good, the development of the story in the past is just another Lost World episode, where people are chased all over the place. His earlier novels (inlcuding Jurassic Park) had a great combination of action and science. This book is great in very good in the science and theory, but the adventure, is just another dumb screenplay of wild geese being chased."
3,Very Good but....,"An excellent book to read, but seemed a tad too much like he was writting a screenplay instead of a book. Definately a quick read as once the book gets going it never lets up."
2,Huge Disappointment,One of very few books that I just couldn't get invloved in. The ending is fairly predictable and the book is a chore to read. I think Chrichton is trying to sell movies rather than write good books. Airframe was the last book I really enjoyed from him.
2,Connecticut Yankee (s) in King Arthur's Court Redux,"Admittedly its been many years, but does anyone agree that this is Twain's classic set in the high tech age?Good start; great promise; reduced to a fast paced but non-spellbinding revisit to Medieval Times.Such a premise had such promise! Oh Well, everyone is allowed one disappointment!"
3,"Good book, Not enough tech stuff","The storyline of this book was great- the idea that using quantum physics a person could move through time in ways never imagined is an excited direction to take. The only thing that this book lacked was substance on the technology side of things. At the beginning of the book, I was pleased by the alternating focus from tech to story to tech. But as the book progressed, there was less tech and more story; I felt that the middle of the book, if anywhere, needed more focus on the tech. side of things. But, I still enjoyed the story. There just seemed to be room (although maybe not much) for more extensive use of technology."
3,Could have been brilliant but several bad flaws,"Entertaining story but I agree with the other reviewers: Crichton contradicts himself terribly with the multiverse thing, which could have gotten the characters out of some situations nicely. Translator ear-pieces were indeed a joke and some great character development opportunities were missing. About 20 more pages could have done much of this without changing the feeling of length too much. The exact idea of the theme park was not well described and the long speeches from the billionaire Donigan were unnecessary, especially given the predictable end. A few more nice twists could've been added. I wonder if the inevitable movie will pick up on them?"
4,Lost Opportunity,"Its obvious that the amount of research for this book must have been immense. While the book delivers some interesting moments, the author must have just gotten tired of writing at the end, and contrived the ending you would expect, after reading the previous chapters. No surprises, no weird twists.Still an interesting and entertaining book, but, it's a formula book, and he's plainly writing to interest Hollywood in the screenplay version.Creighton's a brilliant man, and his books often display the real depth to his mind. This one could have had much more depth to it."
4,Medieval time,"The first half of the book is interesting and keeps you reading and learning of the quantum theory and the middle age, how they travel to the past and saw the actual images what they had studied, and it is incredible if you compare the middle age with our days, believe me, it is almost the same, they have a castle and 15 minutes later the castle was down, we have the twin towers and 15 minutes later we haven't.The second part of the book is a little bit to long, they are fighting and when they were almost lost it happened a miracle and they won the fight, how many miracles can be in a book? maybe it would be better if they were in the middle age for 18 hours instead of 37, just a point of view."
5,Wonderful,"Great story, great characters and character development. It keeps the pace up, it never really slows down but it doesn't go too fast. Good action scenes and just for the record I have read it so many times. What else is there to say, just read it and love it."
4,Great but a little too violent,This book was very good and kept me interested the whole time i was reading it. I am not a big fan of reading so when i like a book it must be good. The imagination behind the story was fun along with the actual historic facts. I can't wait to start another one of his books! The only drawback was the endless fighting. It got a little boring but quickly picked up again!
4,sci-fi entertainment,"A very entertaining book for sci-fi fans, however, if you're a Chriton fan, you may not like his latest foray into the world of sci-fi. Chriton does a good job of trying to explain the ""science and technology"" behind the story.The book is entertaining and quick reading with a good amount of action. Not knowing much of Medieval history makes it easier to swallow the storyline. Nice twist at the end...."
4,"Slow Start, but Good Book","It takes about 130 pages for this story gets off the ground, but once it does, it soars. Be patient. It is a very entertaining read."
2,just ok,"I may be in the minority here, but I thought this book was somewhat boring. The characters were stiff and two dimensional, and the dialogue was slow and hard to believe. At times the plot did rise to the occasion distracting me from the lame dialogue, but I must say that overall I was pretty disappointed. Take this for what it's worth. I would recomend it only if you have nothing better waiting unread on your bookshelf."
4,I enjoyed this,"50/50 on this one. There is a lot of action in this book. If you want a page by page ride, this will work for you. I read it and had a hard time putting it down, though still felt a bit of a let down.At points, the author makes a big deal to get one point across, then in the next chapter, they seem to not mention it In one chapter, everyone is wondering where so-in-so is and in the last part of the chapter, we see this person. In the next chapter, he is not mentioned. So there is a build up and then........"
4,Great novel that mixes history with modern science.,"I'm a big history and science buff, so this book was everything I wanted. It didn't get 5 stars because it seemed to get rushed at the ending. The first half or third were very slow, but enjoyable. As soon as the last 150 pages rolled around, the pace was very fast. It wasn't so fast that you missed somethings, but it was a little fast for my liking. Still a good book if you like history and adventure."
5,Absolutely positively one of the best books EVER,"Having never read anything by Michal Crichton before, when i first picked up this book, i had no idea of what to expect. The beginning was, by degrees, fairly boring. it had a very slow pick-up, and until about chapter five or six, the book was extremly slow-reading. There was one event, and for those out there who have read the book, you will know what i mean, the one event that got the entire ball rolling. From that point on, the book went up and down hills and through loops and everywhere, never loosing any bit of excitement. It was tension down to the last page, but the ending and epilouge were a little on the odd side. I can't say much more here, except BUY THIS BOOK! PUT EVERYTHING ELSE ON HOLD UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED READING IT! you will not be dissapointed."
3,Crichton has done better(TimB3)_,"I was really excited to read this book, because I've never yet read a time travel science fiction book that made me believe it or feel any respect for the science behind it. I thought that if anyone could do it, Crichton could. Not only does Crichton not, it seems like he doesn't even try. There are plot holes you could drive a truck through.This was not my favorite Crichton Book He could have done better like in Jurrasic Park. He had my fists gripped and at the edge of my seat the whole time. I couldn't put it down. Timeline was the hardest book to get into. I felt I was bored with the life history of each Character, some details were so boring that I about fell asleep. The setting was superbly put together in my head with words. This is an average example of Michael's writing talent"
2,"Like reading a script, minus the dialogue.","Although the plot was interesting (even though it was merely a Jurasic Park), the writing, character development, etc. was lacking considerably. Why, oh why, couldn't Crichton have populated the story with three dimensional characters that one could enjoy following? All of the characters could easily have been replaced by Good Guy 1, Good Guy 2, Bad Guy 1, and Bad Guy 2, and NO harm would have come to the story--that's how underdeveloped they were! As for the writing, there are ways to begin dialogue other than to type He said, ""..."" And what about atmosphere, tangible descriptions, etc? In short, the book had a good concept but unfortunatey seemed to have been written merely as the forethought to a script."
2,"Entertaining, but Major Flaws","Because of plenty of action, I found this book a good read which kept my attention. I had to get past plenty of drawbacks, however, first and foremost Crichton's unending trademark lecturing. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, parallel universes is a tough one to swallow, quantum physics or no. Face it, that was a feeble catch-all to get around the paradox dilemna. Another problem with the time travel concept is why, once we've developed the technology, we are not being visited by future travellers, who would be benefitting by perfected technology? This and many other questions are left unanswered by this story. To enjoy this book, accept it for what it is, a fantasy--but wait for the paperback."
2,"Good premise, lame delivery","I was so excited by the premise of this novel that I had trouble waiting until Christmas had passed to buy it. Unfortunately, it read like a lump of coal.I have to agree with other reviewers who panned this one for lack of depth, mechanical story elements, weak characterization, and a sense of impending Hollywood.If you are looking for a good Crichton read, try Airframe or Sphere. Don't bother with this silly book."
2,Sphere was better,"This book was ok..but kind of boring. It wasn't all that I thought it would be. I liked the beginning and all of the scientific stuff. However, I found the running around fighting knights deal boring and redundant..and unfortunately, that was the majority of the book."
4,This books feels like a guilty pleasure!,"I couldn't put it down. Is it fine literature? No way! But it IS a most intriguing, exciting, and thoroughly delicious way to pass a few evenings.Crichton's research into the Middle Ages is exhaustive, and described in relatively simple terms that we who are not experts can still understand, and visualize.Yes, it reads like a movie. Yes, I guess a film is in production. And yes, I'll be the first in line to see it."
3,Timeline and Jurassic Park.,"The similarities between Timeline and Jurassic Park are legion. But the most important similarity is that both books peaked in the middle and went downhill from there. The descriptions of the dinosaur cloning techniques and the travel-to-parallel-universe techniques were very fun. Then both books deteriorated rapidly -- Jurassic Park into a dinosaurs-chasing-people story (in which you knew the kids would be spared), Timeline into a medieval knights-chasing-people story (in which you knew the spunky heroine wouldn't be killed). In each case, the first half of the book was worthwhile enough to overcome the flaws of the second half."
3,"Good, but too many questions","A very quick, easy read that keeps the reader interested. Although, when reaching the conclusion, you find yourself asking too many questions. Why didnt they just go back in time to before the professor went back? How could these history geeks possibly have a chance in battles of people of that time? The big secret seemed to be the discovery of another time traveler with the earpiece, but yet his presence in the book was predictable and inconsequential.Also, I pose a question on Crichton's explanation of the impossiblity of a paradox. First of all, through minor, the professor's messages were, in fact, a paradox. His actions affected history. Doniger's explanation of the impossibility of this phenomenon was equally frusterating. Additionally, the ending seemed to be a paradox, though never explained. It was said that the castle was lost due to a traitor. Is the professor the traitor?"
4,One of Crichtons best.,"Timeline has to be on of Micheal Crichtons best works ever. This book grabs you right from the start and pulls you into a very sspensefull plot. The plot to this book is so incredibly thought out. It so great to read along and see how everything fits together. The characters in the story are also very well written and you can really relate to them. The book is also a wonderful twist of science fiction with med-evil that will apeal all kinds of different audiences. And for all the history buffs out there, this book also has a bit off real historical refrence to kings of the time period. This is just an alot great book for readers of all genres and will appeal to many audiences. I smell a movie!!"
2,Perhaps a better title would be Medieval Park.,"I was sorely disappointed by this story which is nothing but a recycling of the Jurassic Park tale. We once again have a misguided (evil?) individual who wants to create the ultimate theme park ride for vacationers. There are plenty of two-dimensional characters, including the story's hero, who studies dead languages, jousting, sword-fighting and archery in his spare time. All of this just happens to come in handy when he needs to travel back to medieval Europe. I guess he just knew that one day he would need all this archaic expertise in order to fill the holes in Mr. Crichton's plot. The descriptions of medieval England are wonderfully detailed, but even there the world the author has invented is peopled with uninteresting, flat characters who behave like villains in an Errol Flynn movie."
1,A disappointment...,"I anxiously await each Michael Crichton book. With the exception of Congo, I have enjoyed his books tremendously and was expecting a great read in Timeline. Rather, I found a story line that never approached even the remotest possibility of being plausible. Then when the unfortunate four characters are transported into the past, they encounter an incredible number of life threatening skirmishes. The first battle was interesting enough I suppose. Same with the third and maybe even the fifth or sixth. But when you got to the twelfth or fifteen life threatening skirmish, you begin to think that maybe this was more a script for a computer game than a novel. In a little over 37 hours, they are stabbed, shot with arrows, sliced with swords and encounter every imagine obstacle. These people are either supper human or incredibly lucky."
3,Don't be suprised when this becomes a movie.,"The novel starts out interesting enough. A little background on quantum physics and an archeological dig. Two things that are practically polar opposites. Usually this makes for a compelling read, but it some how falls short.About a third of the way into the novel, Crichton begins thinking summer blockbuster and writes accordingly. You have the good looking and intelligent hero, the professor, the attractive firebrand woman, and the slightly inept but well meaning young man who finds courage and gets the woman at the end. Each character then fits into the Hollywood script template which finishes in an exciting cresendo.I won't lie and say that I did not enjoy it. The hit machine is tried and true. It is a fast summer read that keeps you enthralled. But what really gets me was that he really could have done so much more with the story. I expected more."
3,Comparable to some Star Trek TV series scripts,"While the book is written in a more complex, detailed style, it reminds me of several Star Trek concepts: Time and space travel; trying to fit in with persons from another era. There is even a discussion of Star Trek's Prime Directive not to interfere with other worlds or to affect their history, although Crichton does not mention Star Trek. I wish the book had been more original."
3,"A slow moving, fast paced story!","I've only read a few Crichton books and I would'nt have bought this one, but it was given to me as a gift, so I felt obligated to read it. It's about half interesting. I think it drags on too much when the characters are in the past in Medieval France. While in the past the characters survive way too many close calls, i.e. drownings, falling off cliffs, falling out of castle windows, a close encounter with a beheading, etc. Not even cats have that many lives. Okay, it's fantasy, but its goofy fantasy. The author does have a great skill at writing and makes it easy to envision the sights and sense of the period in the past. I enjoyed the character of Doniger as CEO of a nasty mega-corporation. But is anybody really that ruthless and evil. Okay, maybe Hitler! I guess if you're a Crichton fan this book will be another good read. I thought it dragged when the story was in the past. I'm glad I stayed with it, but I'm glad to finally be done reading it!"
2,"The reason they separate ""fiction"" from ""literature.""","By Crichton's standard's, poorly written. He must have had tons of help doing the research, and there were parts of the book that were so bad I swore he must have had help with the writing, too. No character development, far too many narrow escapes. Far too many hacked-off limbs, flaming heads and arrows in the eye. About 100 pages too long. On the plus side, very interesting popularization about how quantum theory may be applied some day, and the attention to detail about 14th century France was excellent. Too bad the writing was so shallow."
2,Unfortunately Bland,"Having read a number of Chrichton's books, from Jurassic Park to Eaters of the Dead, I have to say that ,though not his worst, this was deffinetly not his best. He appeared to be rushing through many portions of the book which could have used much more detail, such as the town one of the characters runs through, the tournament he competes in and the dungeon he is imprisoned in. I hope Chrichton has not exhausted his repetoire of immaginative yarns, as this novel had much to ask for. Even with the lack of detail, it is however, a great tale with a very orriginal ending allong the lines of the original printing of JP and Hammonds demise."
3,Movie Script,Written to be made into a movie very obviously. Twice the ridiculous escapes as even TITANIC had.
3,Interesting and Intriguing Topic,"I found Timeline to be an interesting read. However, there were several chapters that could have been omitted and the book still would have flowed well. For those of us who enjoy reading period pieces, Timeline does deliver."
2,Well short of the usual Crichton novel,"Michael Crichton begins with a solid foundation for yet another thrilling novel, but unfortunately trips himself up along the way.The idea of time travel, while interesting and key to this story, isn't made strong enough to believe or even explained enough to completely comprehend. The reader is left with too many questions regarding its validity, even for a fiction book, which therefore takes away from the rest of the tale.And the rest of the tale grows thin as well. The surprisingly lacking character development never creates a well-rounded cast and allows for predictable outcomes. Certain sequences seem extremely unlikely dispite the fantasy aspect of the story. Crichton seemed to force the drama in some passages, creating the cheesy scenes Hollywood is most likely to scoop up. The reader soon begins to pray for a quick conclusion to the book instead of hope for more.Though well written, Crichton's latest novel is far from the norm."
2,Must...try...to..finish..reading..,"I'd say only the first 20 pages or so of the book was good...after that there are just too many characters that were thrown in and the story becomes too engrossed in the medieval era...not what I was expecting from Crighton. Perhaps it gets better, but I find it hard to get involved."
3,Fun Read But Not Great Literature,"I haven't read a Crichton book in a while but had seen many of the movies made from his previous novels. And reading this book I felt like I was reading a future screenplay for ""Timeline"" the movie. The book had incredible (actually impossible) feats of strength and daring by 20th century characters in 14th Century France. Many times I felt that if this were true to form the people would most certainly be dead...but miraculously they survive...again and again and again and again. On a more positive note, the book moves along at a good clip and the science behind the technology involved in transporting the characters back to 14th century France was intriguing. All in all I would say that this is a fun book to read but not a mind boggling novel that keeps you thinking after your done. It is pretty much mindless fun with unusual science."
3,Indaina Jones meets King Arthur,"Timeline is a decent, fast read, but wasn't at all what I was expecting after seeing Matt Lauer interview the author on Good Morning America. I love an historical novel, but this doesn't qualify. It had a healthy dose of ""Jurassic Park"" and somewhere in the middle I got the distinct impression that Crichton wasn't writing a novel at all, but was more interested in a screen play.If you like Indiana Jones type action, buy it now. If you think you're getting a thinking man's novel, wait for the paperback."
3,Great start then it went nowhere,"I loved the 'science' and commentary on the future, but the story of running around 1357 that fills the last two-thirds of the book got really long with no real point. This must have been written with a movie deal in mind. This book read like a Hollywood thriller."
2,reading TIMELINE is like following a poor video game...,"Micheal Crichton has great ideas with fairly well researched science behind them. BUT he just cannot write well! The beginning of the book is very informative and has a scientific compelling twist...and then there comes the 'fill': a long tale -pages and pages- of video game like fast paced medieval fihgts, where the 'actors' get wounded, recover on the next page then almost die instantly get a new life to run around to another battle ...: Michael, do you ever read again what you just typed on the page or do you rest on the laurels gained in your much better early books while watching the royalties flow in?"
5,Crichton does it again.,"TIMELINE is outstanding, Crichton tells a story that brings together all the elements that made his thrillers so good. With wonderful characters and a fabulous storyline you will be unable to put the book down. Order it now sit down and enjoy!"
2,Wait for the Movie,"I was comforted to know that others felt the same -- that this book read more like a long movie script than a book. This book has way to many near death and saved at the last minute scenes to be believable. I was pleading to the author about halfway through to put them out of their misery!I like the overall story line but in the hands of a more talented author this book could have really become something. For instance, character interactions more developed, scenery described for a reader, not someone who would be watching TV, etc. This book, as it reads, is a movie script -- nothing more."
1,Bad Book,"This book is awful. If you have any science and sci-fi background, you'll see his plot is inconsistent with itself. Plus he didn't think through the fact that, if time travel were even possible, the team could have simply gone back to the time of the original problem and grabbed the subject of the whole tedious search for themselves. Don't bother. Re-read Jurassic Park instead!"
2,Good Start - Bad Middle - Good Ending,"Author had a great concept but failed to follow through with a great book. I eagerly bought this book when it was released and quickly became bored with it up until the end. Characters were shallow and the author posed a week argument against the paradoxes associated with time-travel. I give this one a ho-hum. (Nice beginning and ending, but the middle was painfully boring.)"
3,"Made for TV; Tape narrators, lose the attitude","Much of my positive criticism -- fun ideas -- and negative criticism -- predictable, made-for-TV movie quality; endless unnecessary action -- has already been said.So I'll focus on the narration style (from the audiotape version). Narrators, lose the attitude. When you're reading descriptive prose (little enough of it in Crichton's book), just read it. You don't have to give a snide ending to every sentence. Let us use what little of our imagination is left... your snideness distracts from the story."
3,Formulaic Crichton,"For the first half of this book, I was wildly enthusiastic, couldn't put it down. Then the action got so heavy, the characters remained weakly drawn, and I found myself skipping over sections that were way too detailed but also boring. I hung in there to see what would happen, realizing that this book reads like a movie screenplay, and hungering to learn more about the PEOPLE. Too much action, and quick, unsatisfying ending. The suspense of finding out what Doniger was up to didn't live up to the discovery. Formula Crichton: mega-research, weak characters, quick ending. I used to LOVE Crichton: is it me or him?"
3,He's done better - chose another,"Crichton can excel, but not in this (althought the book is better than the lame film). It starts so well but then the plausability level tanks and it all gets a bit tedious. The general concept is strong but the characters just act out of turn.. hard to put my finger on it. If you like Crichton then go check out State of Fear as it's stronger and better. Or if you like this genre, an alternative - which is a much better read - is Secret Revelation by Steve Bell. Uncannily similar begining. Or go back and take some vintage Crichton, if you haven't already checked them out."
3,something missing,"I've enjoyed several of the Crichton novels I've read lately, especiallly Prey and Airframe. I just had a hard time getting into timeline. I liked the premise and the setting of the book was really good, but I just found myself glazing over the words rather than truly absorbing them. Rather than being on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it ended, I just couldn't wait for it to end so I could start another book.As I said, hard to explain, but something missing from this one that I can't quite put a finger on."
2,Has it come to this?,"If your aim is to while away time--in an airplane, in the dentist's waiting room, wherever--this works fine, but that's really all I can say for it. As fluff stuff goes TIMELINE is not top grade, but it is all right. Don't get me wrong: I like fluff as much as the next guy, and even if you disagree and think this IS top grade fluff stuff, that's fine by me. It is NOT fine by me if you call it ""a masterpiece""--not because I myself happen to consider it mediocre, but because the nature of the genre itself rules out the possibility of masterpieces. Understand me, by ""the genre"" I do not mean science fiction--science fiction has masterpieces (Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" and H.G. Wells's ""The Time Machine"", for examples)--; I mean fluff: There are no fluff masterpieces. You'd might as well compare Britney Spears to Mozart, and our (lack of) culture has got to a sorry state when this is not universally recognized."
2,Typical Chricton,"A rather dull ramble through the usual Chricton style. The 'action' was slow, the characters flawed and the plot a litle underdeveloped. The only interesting part was the theory behind time travel. Here, Chricton shows his ability to perform detailed research and to put it accross in his clear and precise manner. Not a great read, but fairly interesting nonetheless."
1,"Dreadful, amateurish","This book is intended to be a bad made-for-TV movie, since anyone who enjoys reading will be appalled at the contrived plot. After about the 20th time one of our heroes is about to be killed, but instead is rescued at the last second by an incredibly-improbable event, I started rooting for the cartoonish bad guys."
1,A rip-off and not even a good one.,"My goodness, this was an unoriginal, cliché-ridden, and predictable piece of junk. Scientists and historians travel through time back to medieval Europe and CAN'T GET BACK...imagine! If you've ever read A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT or seen a bad STAR TREK holodeck episode, you already know the whole story and will guess the ending long before the halfway point. One could have forgiven the lack of originality, though, if the writing was up to Crichton's best. TIMELINE, however, is a wandering mess, the plot bursting with outrageous contrivances, tangential, unresolved subplots-a suspicious policeman's investigation disappears without a trace halfway through the book-and the lamest ""cliffhangers"" you're likely to find this side of Superman. I finished this dud slack-jawed, not wanting to believe that one of my favorite authors could publish such rubbish. Unfortunately, he can and he did."
3,"Starts Great, Ends Weak","I've been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for some time, his novels combine the action and suspence of a blockbuster movie, but at the sametime not becoming a trashy ""airport"" novel. Timeline is no exception doing for timetravel what Jurassic Park did for genetics. But there are problems here, the characters are far to shallow, we are told that they are good or evil from the first paragraph, sides from which the characters rarely deviate. With the characters being so black and white it does mean that this book is quite put downable in places. Also Crichton's views on affecting the future in this book are quite the opposite of the chaos theory views that were preached in Jurassic Park. The film will be great, but the book could have been better."
1,Bad science + bad plot + non-existent character development,"Wow, this was a truly awful book. It's filled with long, pedantic, and patently false scientific explanations that are painful to read. The characters are completely hollow and the story just plods along without any direction. What little development there is is completely implausible. A book that should not have been written."
1,Timeline - Very Disappointing,"I found the book very disappointing. The idea was too similar to Jurassic Park for comfort (ie secretive hi-tech company meddling in things it does not fully understand) and the plot was tedious and repetitive. Not recommended, which is a pity as Michael Crichton's books are often very exciting"
2,Good idea...bad execution,"I really liked this book...I did, but I found myself reading The Naked God by Peter Hamilton more often than picking up Timeline. (I was reading both at the same time, time constraints) Michael Chriton's most recent books have incorporated a futuristic, but eerily easily acheiveable technology with a dangerous ""All heck breaks loose"" pessimistic situation. I really like his straight to the point, non-fluff writing style, but this book took it way too far. I mean, yes a quick read is nice...but this book even had grammar errors...how is that? Nice story, I'd rate this as a 50/50 buy. Like my title, Good idea...Bad Execution"
1,Movie is ten times better!!,The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie.And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute.
1,Still in a rut.,"I thought Crichton might finally step out of his string of low quality books he has been writing (Airframe and The Lost World) and step back to the genius displayed in his early works (Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park and Sphere). Alas, I was disappointed with Timeline. The book starts off interestingly, presenting a good premise, but it dissolves into a mess of pointless action scenes that do not hold the book together. Characters are shallow and the plot is terribly predictable. I keep giving Crichton a chance to wow me again... unfortunately this did not do it."
2,Timeline About 400 Pages Too Long,Timeline is a sad example of a successful and talented author taking a tired formula with a semi-interesting scientific twist (quantum magic)and creating a movie-in-waiting only thinly disguised as a novel. We have come to expect so much more from Crichton. And he delivers so little here. Character development is minimal. And the villains are cartoonish in their stereotypicality. Crichton's batting average has been high going all the way back to early work like The Great Train Robbery. But he took a weak swing here and struck out. This milennium version of The Time Machine meets Bill Gates really bytes.
2,Entertaining start that slowly disinigrated,This is a very simple review for me.The beginning and build-up to to the actual event of the time travel was great.The next 20 pages following the time travel were good.The rest of the book was like a bad action movie where the good guy beats up 30 bad guys in horrible action scenes.It became ridiculous.
1,"Bad, bad, oh so bad.","This book is painful, breaking-your-own-nose-by-slamming-your-head-into-the-corner-of-a-wall painful. Yes, it hurts that much. The real problem with this book is that you could basically write it yourself for all of its predictability. Oh, who could have EVER guessed that the dude really into midevil stuff would stay in the past?? And the plot devices...so lame! Grendades conveniently getting people stuck in the past, etc. If you have ever stuck your hand directly into a fire and held it there for over 30 seconds, you probably have the endurance and willpower to make it through this book. Otherwise..."
1,"Weak, movie screenplay","I usually stick with a book after the first hundred pages if I like the style, plot and characters. Since this was my first Crichton novel, I gave it some extra time which I regret. It was like reading the screenplay of one of those cheesy Star Trek episodes. Don't read this book even if you like knights. And don't read Ivanhoe either! -RP"
1,Save Your Money,"After reading ""Red Sun Rising"" I had high expectations. This book was a big disappointment. It appears his many facts and details were presented only as a poor attempt to impress the reader with his research."
4,Interesting and fun book - but no more,"Timeline was a very enjoyable read (took me 4 days to finish it and I was in Rio - 50 steps from the beach!). The author cleverly explains the mechanics and theories behind time travel and I really, really liked the way the book went back and forth from historical times to modern era. There are some inconsitancies regarding the actual theory, but very minor - they in no way interfere with the story. The last two chapters were strong, bt were unfitting - the characters behave in ways that are not like them at all. I think the author just wanted to make an ending that would surprise a movie adience and didn't quite know what to do."
2,"Wow, another Michael Crichton screenplay","Another made for a movie book. I think Michael Crichton is getting lazy and doesn't want to bother turning yet another book into a screenplay so he seems to be starting with the screenplay and fleshing it out slightly to make a book. MC's strengths have always been the science in the books and this is no exception. You get a fairly good tutorial on quantum mechanics and how it might be used for time travel. His weaknesses have always been the characters and on this one he is at his worst. By the end of the book I really don't care if any of them make it back. The characters are basically a rehash of ""Jurassic Park"". The evil industrial genius / rich guy, the soulless technicians and the heroic academics. The plot is also thin and fairly predictable. I almost didn't bother to finish it."
3,"Not a bad read, but somewhat incoherent","Crichton couldn't seem to make up his mind whether he was writing a parallel universe story or a time-travel story.In a parallel universe story, which this starts out to be, events in one universe don't affect the other. Here, a message left in a 14th- century universe seems to travel to the 20th-century universe inhabited by the characters at the novel's start. And when one of them travels to that medieval universe and stays there, his life and death show up in the historical record of the 20th-century universe.After investing a lot in historical research and at least a little in becoming familiar with quantum physics, it's a shame that Crichton couldn't get the novel's overall conception entirely straight."
5,one of the best books I have ever read!,"This book is one of the best I have ever read. It isn't a a scifi as I thought it would be, but it definately isn't dissapointing. The description of the whole ""transportation process"" was understandable and I found myself nodding along and understanding. Timeline is definately a five star book and as it says on the front cover ""Crichton delivers..."""
3,"Not his best, but good","If you are a loyal Crichton fan, you will enjoy this book. It probably will not make it to the top of your list, but enjoyment will be there. If you are new to Crichton, you are sure to enjoy this book. It has of what you heard about him.Michael Crichton does a wonderful job of offering the reader scientific facts along with his wonderful stories. Most of the time, these facts are easily understood, although occasionally, a reader may get lost. In Timeline, I was getting a little 'fuzzy' when they were talking about the quantum phsyics, but hey its quantum phsyics. I re-read that part a couple of times, although it might not have been necessary.I only have two complaints about Timeline. First, the peripheral characters were a little hard to keep up with. Second, the ending was slightly predictable (although does offer a couple of turns in the middle and end).All in all, I think it is a good read."
4,a guilty pleasure,"Every now and then you come across a book where upon completion you comment to yourself that was fun to read but when you attempt to analyze why, you realize there is little critical justification. Such was the case for me regarding TIMELINE.Crichton did what I found to be a credible job of outlining quantum theory to a novice like me, at least to the point I could except the premise. His vivid descriptions of 14th century medieval France were interesting although at times the characters seemed to be lost in the background, which was just as well since little effort was spent in development. Overall, this book tended to drift from a somewhat cliched, time-travel sci-fi work to revisionist history of the Dark Ages.But, I liked it. I just cannot explain why."
2,Screen Play with Plot Holes,"Written clearly from the perspective of the inevitable action movie that will eventually capture this book. TimeLine, at its best, gives you a flavor of the 14th century that entertains and enlightens - a bit. As a story, there are plot holes so big, you wince and characters so cardboard you want to scream. ""Future artifacts"" aren't allowed back in time, yet a professor wears his bifocals and everyone from the future carries aluminum canisters full of sleeping gas? Those were around in the days of knights? Unrealistically well-timed grenade-blasts and sword-chops add that flavor of ""give me a break, THAT was convenient for the plot line"" that makes this book just plain silly at times. And all this time travel is to create really realistic theme parks in the present? HellOOO? Jurrasic Park, anyone? Wait for the paperback, for crying out loud."
1,Don't waste your time,"Of course, the ""time machine"" concept is always intriguing, but the execution here leaves much to be desired. Hard to believe this book is on the best-seller list."
4,Good book!,"I found the book quite interesting. In my opinion, it is actually a history log, science factfile and a novel all rolled into one single exciting book! The facts are easily understood as they are well-explained ... unlike some of Crichton's previous novels which didn't really succeed in getting younsters in understanding them... Great book on the whole that's worth your money spent!"
2,use your lifeline......,"i have to wonder is michael crichton is trying to write books or if he's simply writing the screenplay ahead of time. While his research was good and it added to the theory of time travel, the story was predictable as all hell. It was just a little too conveniant for me, the way that everyones talents magically became important in the other world, and the way it climaxed. Crichton should take a lesson from Tom Harris and at least try to throw a little unpredictability into the book. While it was adventurous, it was basically Jurassic Park with a different set of scientists (historians) being the heroes, and a different kind of technology (quantum physics) being the evil. Entertaining: yes, to a 6th grader. Thought-provoking: hardly."
5,A Michael Masterpiece!,"Yet another Michael Crichton 'masterpiece'. After reading my first Michael Crichton book, Jurassic Park, I was stunned by the action...until I came across TIMELINE! Despite dinosaurs being my favourite subject, Timeline makes Jurassic Park look rather simple...."
5,Great Ride,"Timeline is very similar to any other Crichton book: full of intelligent and witty, yet easy to comprehend even for the novice reader, prose that conveys Crichton's intelligent story to the masses.This installment is well researched and introduces the reader to some interesting and very relevant theories in modern Physics. A great stocking stuffer!"
5,"Ironically enough, this book is too good for words...","Far too rare is it that I find a book that compels me to read as if nothing else in the world existed. Timeline did this to me. I loved it. The only thing negative about Timeline is that it ended. I hope to see Timeline on the big screen in the near future.Regards, Dan~"
4,"Anthony Michaels review for ""Timeline""","It was a very good book. Very well written, and very well edited. Michael Crichton, again, managed to entertain his readers. It had a creative and wonderful story, along with great action. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5, was because it was a little drawn out. The story wasn't as confusing, but some parts of the book were kind of boring, which is why it got the number of stars that it did. But, please don't get me wrong. This is an excellent book, and if you read it... I think you'll enjoy it.ALSO WRITTEN BY MICHAEL CRICHTONThe Andromeda StrainJurassic ParkSphere"
3,"Science BS, Adrenaline-Pumped Story","The closest Crichton book I can compare this with is Jurassic Park/Lost World. Again with Timeline we have Crichton attempting to astound us 100 pages of astrophysics, quantum physics, and whatnot. By no means am I an expert in these fields, but if this book was actually a piece of science fiction as I had originally thought it to be, then there shouldn't have been 100 pages dedicated to persuading us readers that this is actually possible. Nonetheless, the story was decent, and personally I felt that the excerpt from the history on the Hundred Years' War was used well by Crichton in sculpting his story. It is an exciting ride through fictional history, but it is also just another one of those ""Crichton books."""
3,"Liked it, but...","...it reminded me of Jurassic Park (or a bid for a screenplay).I would view this as a ""diet"" fiction. With the exception of the science it isn't complex. The characters are able to bumble there way to the end. It has the requisite violence, the damsels in distress and even a clumsy professor. What more could you ask for?"
2,Limits to Imagination,"In Michael Crichton's latest work, Timeline the writer deals with the complicated subject of time travel. The mechanism used for time travel though vaguely explained is sufficient for the story. What I found very hard to fathom were the scenes of conflict. Crichton explains early on that soldiers in this time period were very skilled in the art of battle and yet whenever a conflict arose with our scholastic heroes, the scene resembled a three stooges routine, bumbling guards and near misses and always the heroes developing incredible abilities, capture and escape over and over. Another irritating subject was the use of modern day technology, it was used only when it helped the plot along, but was forgotten when it could have been used to avoid precarious situations. I'm afraid that these flaws really took away from the flow of the novel. P.S. In the description of a potential love interest, was it necessary to use the phrase ""handsome Knight"" seven times in one page?"
2,High Dark Ages Park,"Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" reads like like a good author on autopilot (or perhaps one with movie, merchandising, and multimedia rights on his mind). The scientific premise of the novel has the potential to be a compelling story (ala Jurassic Park), but MC litters the story with so many pseudo-scientific contradictions, cliched characters, and hackneyed plot twists that the end result is a story that might make some Zena fans cringe.Crichton's so-called explantion of the irrelevancy of time parodoxes is a laughably shallow 1 1/2 pages long, and is based on 3rd- rate logic that a child could easily rebut. Almost all of the major plot elements are stale and telegraphed, and some of the dialogue and plot twists would make a dime store romance novelist blush.The end result is passably entertaining--but then again I was home sick and didn't have very high standards...You can do better Mike. A LOT better."
2,Thank God for Screenwriters,First Crichton book I've read and if his others are like this then I'm sure he will be ever grateful to Hollywood screenwriters. The topic was promising and the first third was a good read but then quickly turned to dribble. Wait for the movie.
4,Very Worthwhile Read,"Very good story, good action and very likeable characters. About everything you want out of a story. There is a lot going on in this story, sometimes hard to keep track of, but ever so interesting.Movie of this story is coming out end of November 2003 and I am expecting this to be a top notch action movie. With the book, like I stated earlier, there is a lot going on. With the movie, I think they will be able to cut out somethings and concentrate on making a nailing biting, big time action movie.Read the book, watch the movie. You won't be disapointed."
5,"Avid Reader, and this is the best book so far!",I LOVED this book. I cannot stress strongly enough how fantastic it is. It moves so quickly from about 20 pages in until the end. I've read it at least 5 times and never tire of it. I typically don't read or find interesting anything this science fiction oriented but it is incredible. By far the BEST Michael Crichton book ever. I can't wait to go see the movie. Even IF they got desperate enough to cast Paul Walker.
2,Save your money,-The characters were paper thin.-The plot was silly and far from original anyway.-The only interesting part was the discussion of quantum physics.It felt like I was reading a screenplay for a very bad movie.
3,"ok, but not great","i have read SPHERE and RISING SUN by him, and i must say, i didnt like TIMELINE as much as the other ones. i was waiting for more intelligent twists, more philosophical ideas, the subject of time travel could make for a much more interesting story than a mere medieval adventure, imho. for example, a more complex relationship between Decker and the heroes could have been interesting. also, from the movie back to the future, he could have 'stolen' some ideas, especially the matter of how the future can be modified in the past.it's an entertaining book, for sure, but a little disappointing."
5,The best Crichton book I've read,"I've read a lot of Michael Crichton's books and I think that this is definatly the best yet. It kept me glued to the book. My only gripe about it is that the end could have been pulled off a little better and it was a little mean. Other then that, it was an excellent book which I would reccommend to anyone with no reservation."
5,Whoa! Typical Crichton!,"Oh wow. I really love this book. Crichton does it again. I love all of Michael Crichton's books and this one takes the cake. If you like Crichton, you will have fun with this one for sure."
3,"Interesting fantasy, but reads too much like a movie.","I've read many of Michael Crichton's novels, and I generally like his work ... but this book wasn't particularly satisfying. It was absorbing enough, even a little exciting at times, and obviously Crichton did his homework on 12th century France ... But this book reads too much like a tie-in to a movie that hasn't even been made (and God knows it's just a matter of time before the movie IS made). Most of the various conundrums the characters find themselves in are resolved entirely too quickly and neatly. Crichton is quite up-front in admitting that the notion of time-travel remains in the realm of fantasy, but even he could have explored the paradoxes involved a little more convincingly. If books were meals, this one would taste okay but certainly wouldn't be very filling."
2,Timeline not up to snuff,"A far, far better book is Connie Willis' ""Doomsday Book"", from which it seems Mr. Crichton took many of his ideas for ""Timeline"". ""Doomsday Book"" was published before ""Timeline"", and it is very interesting how much of the initial story set-up the two books have in common. Maybe Mr. Crichton isn't so original after all!"
4,Why the 'disappointment'?,"I feel positively Medieval. I didn't ""download this book onto my Pocket PC"". I read it the old fashioned way, on audiocassette.I can't help but be confused by all the reviewers who were ""disappointed"" by this book. It reminds me of the story of the man who picked up a rattlesnake and was surprised when it bit him. After all, his is a book by Michael Crichton, the king of the formulaic thriller. Take some good guys, some bad guys some greedy guys and some altruistic guys, throw them into a dangerous, otherworldly setting and see what happens. If you don't like the way he writes, don't pick it up! You read it to be entertained and, in that regard, `Timeline' succeeds admirably.If you want something more scholarly, read Barbara Tuchman's ""A Distant Mirror"", (which Crichton relied on heavily for period info). It's almost as thrilling, lots more informative and it's not even fiction."
3,Time Grind,"I've been an avid Crichton fan since picking up The Andromeda Strain as a young teen. I still love Congo--probably my favorite overall. I approached this book with high expectations. The premise intrigued me, and I enjoy medieval settings. Unfortunately, after a great build-up, I found myself in a two-dimensional 14th century, with cardboard villians and annoying scene-breaks (used to move along the story, I suppose). Time seemed to grind by as I read to the end. It came as no surprise that some early subplots never matured. For example, what happened to Sophie? Why was she even introduced in her scenes with Chris early on? I'd pass this book on, but with only a half-hearted recommendation. In the old days, Crichton would've taken the time to make this book gallop. Instead, it came trotting to the finish line, taking first-place by using the shortcuts allowed only by previous success."
1,no longer a novelist,"Michael Crichton has become a director, a screenwriter, a producer, and a creator of TV shows, among other endeavors, but he's apparently spreading himself too thin. I enjoy his writing style (loved ""Andromeda Strain,"" ""Disclosure,"" ""Airframe,"" and the first 2/3 of ""Jurassic Park""), but he seems to be losing his focus in his novels. ""Timeline,"" like ""Jurassic Park,"" starts out with an extremely innovative plot and then deteriorates into a series of chase and rescue scenes (either dinosaurs or knights on horseback). Crichton is spending less time on character development---you don't really care what happens to any of these two-dimensional folks in ""Timeline""---and more on visualizing how this novel will look on the silver screen. This is a major talent who needs to concentrate more on his writing or to give it up for a bit while he pursues other interests. Those of us who buy his books are being cheated by his half-hearted efforts as a novelist."
3,good start....bland finish,timeline starts out really strong..a page turner. there are enough stories happening to keep your interest. the end kinda falls apart. you know when you go see a movie and you just know they ran out of maney and had to slap an ending together? thats how i felt at the end of the book.
2,"Good story idea, awful execution.","As a Michael Crichton fan, I found this book disappointing. The fundamental ideas underlying the plot were good and Crichton takes pains to make the quantum concepts reasonably clear (though in simplifying them he skips over a lot of details that don't quite jell with his plot!). I also found the glimpses of feudal life in the middle ages to be fascinating. For all that however, the plot development never quite takes off and a very large number of situations in the novel seem to be contrived rather than flowing with the storyline. As other reviewers have commented, this is closer to a movie outline than a book and there are contradictions galore. Excusable perhaps from a new author but not from Crichton. Two stars for the initial idea, but that is all."
3,Not bad at all,"Mr. Crichton has written a pretty good story here. Scientific explanations of the multiverse are understandable (probably to be scorned by real physicists,but whatever), plot is tight and really good on timing. Crichton's weakness as a writer tends to be character development, and TIMELINE is no exception. The characters are, at best, a sketchy set of skills and traits without much depth. It will make a better movie! Read it anyway - it's a fun ride. You'll be ahead of the pack when you see the flick.A much better books on the same theme: Connie Willis' DOOMSDAY BOOK."
3,TIMELINE: Willis did it better,"TIMELINE, despite its intriguing opening, cannot escape inevitable comparisons to THE DOOMSDAY BOOK by Connie Willis, a Hugo- and Nebula-award winning novel on the subject of time-traveling graduate students stuck in the Middle Ages. While Willis was able to generate suspense in about fifteen different ways at once, Crichton is stuck with a plot outline that is heavily reminiscent of JURASSIC PARK and details that amount to little more than a bloodier Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. His lack of interest in creating vivid characters a reader can care about particularly hurts this story, for some reason. If you liked this, then DOOMSDAY BOOK will blow your socks off."
2,"After Strong Start, Timeline Falls Short at Finsh Line","The premise of this book is imaginative and interesting and starts off very well. However, this books turns into a history lesson of the 14th century period and is predictable and uninteresting after the mid point. There is no doubt that Mike did his homework on two subjects: Quantum physics and medieval times, but he uses too much research in this book which takes away from the characters and the plot. He could have done so much with this premise, but at the end of the book, it leaves the reader saying, ""why bother?"""
2,One point nine thumbs down,"Having been a fan, I ignored the unfavorable reviews and bought the book - only to discover that this story read like a made for TV script. I constantly tried to suspend disbelief to get through - not possible for me. I kept thinking that some high school kid wrote this story - went back in time - substituted it at the last nanosecond with Mr Crichton's publisher and...oh well, enough time wasted. One point nine thumbs down!"
4,A Historical Account,"As a student of French literature, I enjoyed reading _Timeline_ for the vast amount of French history that is described. I also enjoyed the book for its combination of very modern technology and accurate historical depictions."
5,incredible detail,"Already a fan of Crichton, he impresses me again with his research into the life of the 14th century. His characters, similar to Jurrasic Park, survive several ordeals that may seem improbable - even impossible - but incredibly entertaining.I do not know of another author that can entertain so well and inform so deeply. This man takes emerging technologies to it's furthest limits and lets the reader decide whether the possible benefits or possible consequences out weigh the other.Loved the book. When they make the movie, please don't change ANYthing!"
3,Haven't I read this before?,"I enjoyed Timeline, but I wasn't a hundred pages in when I began to have deja vu. ""The Doomsday Book"" by Connie Willis, written several years ago, and winner of both the Nebula and Hugo is the superior telling of virtually the same story. Crichton, as usual writes a book you can't put down, but I am beginning to wonder where he gets his story ideas from."
4,In Response and Review,"I decided to buy this book after I saw Charlie Rose interview Crichton about this new novel of his. I have read the book through, and rank it high among the books I have read. It was well thought out and researched, and the imaginative plot flows well and quickly [despite some protests I have read] and included facts of the time [medieval] which make it all the more believable. In response to a certain comment - that the average reader feels about six college degrees of separation - I must admit a complete understanding of the novel. High school physics covers most of the quantum theory he uses, minus the quantum foam. As a sophomore in high school, I certainly hope that the general population of readers understands the backdrop of physics and history. A good novel, living up to Crichton's standards, and I recommend it to all readers."
3,Somewhat Good But Not Great,"Since there are over 1400 revies, no need for me to list the details of the story. They're at other posts. Here's my feeling of the reading experience:STRENGTHS OF THIS NOVEL: movement, pacing, good concept, events are well stringed alongWEAKNESSES OF THIS NOVEL: characters lack depth, believability issues sometimes, not enough details to feel one is actually in the medieval ages, characters seem to get out of problems too easily (i.e. lots of other people die around them but the main people do not)."
4,Criticism valid -- so what?,"Read all the critiques you want about this book: It's formulaic (you can almost hear Crichton ""plugging in"" his characters into the Jurassic Park templates: the dubious scientist, the nasty obnoxious mastermind, etc.), it reads more like a screenplay than a novel, character continuity is completely thrown out the window... all of it's true, and none of it really matters... ""Timeline"" is a fun, fast read, with Crichton's trademarked meticulous research, both into the quantum theories going into his time travel apparati (note the bizzarre statements, typical of trying to explain quantum phenomena in everyday terms), and the details of ""Dark Age"" life (the phrase getting a well-deserved debunking by Chrichton at the end of the novel).Sit back for an evening or two, and go back to when chivalry wasn't dead (although you might be, if you're not careful), castles were deadly serious places, and plotting, fighting, backstabbing, and intrigue were all part of a day's work."
3,"Entertaining, but....","Initially after reading this book, I thought to myself ""what a great fun story to read"", but now the more I think about it, it disappointed me.I liked the premise of an adventure through time travel. Reading a Crichton novel means you will get some understanding of certain subjects like quantum engineering or paleontology or underwater sea exploration and a great story that uses this knowledge to enhance the adventure. So same thing here, right? Well, after a while, you're reading simply an adventure of a few people in the medieval times. It got tiresome and it was missing some real tension. Another problem is the characters who went back in time - they're like superheroes. Leaping from beam to beam and jousting with knights and fighting in hand to hand combat with knights - come on!There were some cool aspects to the adventure such as the countdown and a twist here and there, but it was too implausible overall. Would not recommend it."
4,Exciting read!,"Some people have given this book a bad review below, but I'm afraid they've missed the point by a very long shot. This isn't meant to have character depth and a fancy plot, like say, the very good Robert Goddard. It's escapism, pure and simple. The plot is breathless, as the characters go from one problem to the next, and it makes for a thrilling, enjoyable read. Kind of the equivalent of watching a great Hollywood movie. And it has the usual Crichton hallmarks of teaching you about this and that.Highly recommended for when you just want something that's damn exciting and, cliched as the phrase might be, a true Page Turner."
1,mindnumbing endless swordplay,"I anxiously awaited this new book as my son and I have read all of Crichton. My hopes of furthering science frontiers were dashed as the theories were not carried through. I prayed the constant life-threatening situations would end with the death of all the undeveloped characters. Crichton's research of the era is obvious, but the story line is lacking."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed (would like my money back!). MC took a guaranteed winner of a story and managed to bore me to death with his shallow characters and predictable plot.
3,Entertaining but Incomplete,"I found this book very entertaining, but difficult to read at times where the visualazation should have been put into greater detail. It left certain things unexplained and never backtracked to clear it up. It was a fun read though, and I would recommend it."
2,Really Two and a Half stars,"Not his best work. Wonder why he picked Medieval France and not somewhere else. Maybe I missed it in the rambling. If you want to read a wonderful book about time travel read ""Time and Again"" by Jack Finney.I also think it is a ""movie between covers"" and will make a great action flick. A cross between Star Trek and Braveheart. ""Beam me back, Scotty"". Reserve it at your local library, don't waste your money, or buy ""Time and Again"" instead."
2,Formula Writing From Crichton,"I was quite disppointed by this book. A long time Crichton Book, I found this book to be rushed and based on a formula. His intent with this book, as with many others, was to write a book that would be a blockbuster movie.However, there was zero character development and his basic story had very serious holes in it. He wrote too many cop-outs and avoided the serious time travel issues. Furthermore, he often relies on illustrations to describe a scene, because he is unable or unwilling to describe it through words. Save your $20 on the book, and spend it to take a date to the movie."
4,Another One For Crichton,"I've read a whole bunch of his books, and once again, Michael Crichton took me to a whole other world. Yeah, some of the stuff was a little hokey, but all in all I thought that the book was a fun adventure/science fiction/historical novel. He did a good job in explaining all of the scientific language, which is not always the case in his books. I would definately recomend this book, especially if you are a Crichton fan. Enjoy!"
1,false step,"""Timeline"": is quite boring, literarily a disaster, and even the science behind it looks questionable and unconvincing. It's not a novel, but rather what I would call a long description of a movie. I could hardly believe that it was written by the same great author who has given us ""Congo"", and ""Jurassic Park"". My impression is that Crichton himself is well aware of how weak the idea behind the novel is. Then, hundreds and hundreds of repetitive pages about the Middle Ages aren't but about endless chases, and cartoonish coups de theatre. The long and useless list of sources at the end of the volume cannot make up for the author's (regrettable) superficial treatment of both history, and time-travel implications of quantum physics. What a pity!"
2,Very Predictable,"Timeline held my interest all the way through but toward the end it became very predictable. The concept of time travel calls for suspension of reality, granted, but the plot devices used to get the characters where they were needed were a bit too contrived. I think Crighton's writing style, like a lot of modern novelists, is cinematic, as if he's thinking screenplay all the way. The content is shallow enough to skim through in one day, if you have the time to waste. It's mildly entertaining but, after completing it, you might feel as though you could have invested your reading time in something more challenging, or more entertaining."
2,Yet another tired time-travel story,"I thought this book would have Crichton's usual blend of sci fi dazzle and high storytelling flair. Instead I got a dash of pseudoscientific babble (wormholes, quarks, probability fields, oh my,) mixed with another rehash of the old H.G. Wells script (Man invents time machine. Man travels to another time where things are more complicated than he expects. Many problems ensue. Man returns to modern era enlightened.) Yawwwwwwn."
3,Great Idea Formula Fails On This One,"Michael Crichton and Robin Cooke are my two favorite entertainers, so this is a fan being straight up. This one failed. The idea of writing about the technologies involved in teleportation (which is indeed a credible possibility, one Charles Platt did a great job discussing in a past issue of WIRED Magazine) is a good one, but then the author spent three-quarters of the book with ""filler"" material about people actually stuck back in time and wandering hither and yon. Airframe and Prey, both of which spend most of the time focusing on the minutia of the technology, are much superior."
2,inaccurate and inplausible with wooden characters,"with each book, Crichton seems to do less and less research while his characters remain as wooden as ever. Even the young adult at whom the text is aimed will scoff at some of the contradictions.Knights on horseback fire arrows? never.In an early chapter, we learn that the travel does not actually occur in time but occurs between parallel universes. Yet a character who is left behind in the parallel universe leaves notes (and presumably progeny) which show up in the original."
5,The book is an Actual Time Machine!,"I could not put this book down. Being a Michael Crichton fan ever since he released Eaters of the Dead, this has got to be the best book he's ever made. Jurassic Park, sitting happily atop my pedestal as Crichton's best has been knocked out by this book.Timeline actually transports the reader to medieval times, making you relish in the beauty and mystery of such an era, infused with modern thinking and perceptions in the mix. Although such modernism would make the characters in the book seem to have more convenient and pleasant circumstances to deal with, I'm glad that Crichton showed in this book that science doesn't fare well with the raw and unadulterated old-world era the book brings you to. From the swashbuckling sword fights to the near death escapes of the characters, I felt that I was with them along the journey, just as I felt when I was with Dr. Alan Grant seeing the dinosaurs for the first time."
5,Wow!,"There is only one word to summarize this book. WOW. I am a 14 year old reading fanatic and Michael Crichton is, to me, the author of authors. This book proves it. I never thought he would be able to write a better novel than Jurassic Park, or Congo, or even The Lost World. (Hear me out, the movie did not do an ounce of justice to the book) But Timeline blows them all away. I reccomend it to everyone I meet, and as of now, I am reccomending it to you!"
4,Light and Enjoyable,"There's not a whole lot of depth to this novel. There's not even too much origality. Crichton does create a fairly successful novel though. What he does is take several different genres - time travel, swashbuckling - and he combines them. He does so with a lot of humor and some decent characterizations. The technical writing part of this about time travel is so intriguing that it doesn't make you lose any interest in the book. He employs a lot of techniques like leaving a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter and using the against-the-clock device. Crichton doesn't break any new ground here, but a reader looking for pure entertainment should definitely be pleased with this fun novel."
3,This new book can't match up to Crichton's others,"The concept was good, original, but just wasn't as good as some of Crichton's past books. Unfortunately it wasn't all that could. I was hoping for something great, but I was disappointed."
3,Longer than needed,"I enjoyed the first half of this book, but it got completely bogged down in the second half. Found myself getting bored and racing through pages in hopes that the plot would start to move again."
4,A Fun Read with a Movie in Mind,"Timeline is the first Michael Crighton novel that I have read. It was the cover that caught my attention, being a history buff. I found the book to be an easy, fun read but from the start saw a movie script written in. Let's face it, Crighton is big in the media, so if he writes with a film in mind, what else should we expect? However, it was a smart, entertaining book and I read it in 2 evenings. Something I haven't done in ages. Less than halfway through the book I was trying to figure out who would be the right actor for each part, and I agree with a previous reviewer....Marek would be difficult to cast. If you want a quick, fun, exciting read, check out this book...Sure, it will be a movie, but now I have more to look forward to!"
2,Time Travel? Ho Hum...,"""Timeline"" is an uneasy mixture of ""Jurassic Park"" (without the dinosaurs) and ""The Princess Bride"" (without the laughs). Once again, super-secret cutting edge technology puts a non-descript (i.e. dull) group of scientists in mortal jeapordy. Can they escape the snarling knights and return to the 20th century before time runs out? Does anyone really care? For all the dangers that the 14th century apparently presented, Crichton is simply not a good enough writer to maintain any suspense whatsoever. His ""action"" scenes read like outlines for a proposed screenplay. And because the characters are such ciphers, our emotions are never invested in what happens to them. Don't waste your time."
3,"It's good, but...","This book has a very interesting premise. Time travel is possible via parallel universes. Crichton explains this very well. He even gives us a dozen interesting characters to play with in this rescue tale. Then he drops it. The end is a bit predictable in my mind, and Crichton throws just enough mind candy out there to keep you hooked and interested. This is a great book, and as far as bringing interesting questions to my mind, he did a great job. His plot line and characters need to be better developed. He could have done better in my mind."
3,Entertaining Enough,"Timeline essentially uses time travel as a device to thrust modern humans into the medieval past to write an action adventure story in that setting. It begins, for all intents and purposes, when a group of graduate student archaeologists, working on a dig under the auspices of a secretive corporation, find a note from their professor asking for help. It just happens the note was written during the Middle Ages. Thus, they are whisked off in a corporate jet and thrust into the past to find the professor and bring him back. So begins the fun as they have to maneuver their way in an unfamiliar environment, and around bad guys, good guys, and in-between guys, and a woman too. There's plenty of fighting, blood, gore, and a little romance.Overall, this novel is entertaining enough but nothing to get overly excited about."
4,Second time through was the best,"Read it in the summer of 2003 while on vacation, saw the movie in Dec, 2003 then read the book again after the movie. It's a fun read, entertaining and exciting. The movie was poor to average. Forget the movie and read the book a couple of times. It's sad how the screenwriters and directors fell down on the movie version of the fine scifi book!"
3,Same old story,"I am somewhat disappointed with this book. The storyline is similar to his previous masterpiece -Jurassic Park, Lost World hence the ending is predictable. However, i have to commend him on his brilliant research on quantum technology which I find truly enlightening."
4,Michael Chrichton is finally back!,"Having read all of the previous Michael Chrichton books and loved every single one of them, I was especially excited to pick this one up. After Airframe I was a little disappointed that Chrichton had lost that special touch that makes his books really different from everyone else, but he has rekindled the spark here in Timeline.If you enjoy reading Sci-Fi or Fantasy reading, then you will throoughly enjoy this practical look at the genre. Even if you don't, then you will be able to enjoy this book because Chrichton brings reality to an unreal world in Timeline.A group of archeologists are exploring an archeological dig and make the discory of a lifetime. Find out what happens when a high-tech firm that owns the site has other plans for it that the archeologists had no idea about, and what they are in store for, is the time of their life, literally!"
5,Great Book,"Time Line is a great book because it is hard to put down. It has a mix of science and the Middle Ages. I bought the small print at Barns & Nobles. I am twelve years old and I read it in a week and one half, and I enjoyed this book very much. The science in it was a little hard to understand but it was interesting. I would not suggest reading this book if you expect it to be factual. But if you are going to read it because you think you are going to like it then I suggest that you get the book and read it."
1,Not even sci fi,"Crichton, whom I've always admired as a writer for his attention to detail, goes far afield in this novel. The postulate of parallel universes is npt new and the thought of visiting one has interested quantum physicist. The asynchronous time aspect is a nice twist. The story is OK. Crichton didn't hurt himself doing too much research on France circa 1000, but the ending is unbelievable. Answer one question if someone dies in an alternate universe can you visit his grave in your universe? Obviously, Crichton is mixing his quantum states which any physicists will tell you cannot be done safely. He really could have done better. He did a far more credible job stretching science in Jurasic Park then here. It wasn't worth the effort"
3,"A good book, but definitely not Crichton's best","Timeline is a story of time travel, parallel universes, history, science fiction, and conflict. The character's are well developed, but leave a small bit lacking. The plot in itself is on the borderline of cliche and unique, and Crichton interprets it rather well. However, I found this book to be a bit too Sci-Fi and fiction for my tastes, despite Crichton's vast use of science. It's obvious that he did his research, but the outcome seems a bit too extreme. Overall, a good book with its strengths and weaknesses."
4,Very Good Novel,"I just completed this book and I must say that I'm impressed. I've read several other of Michael Crichton's books including Sphere, The Andromeda Strain, Lost World, and Congo. This book surpasses all of them. The characters are well thought out and are dynamic throughout the book. The basic plot of the story was consistent and moderately easy to follow. With only a few exceptions, this book was an easy reading, page turner of a book. Michael Crichton's theory's on Quantum Physics and Multiverses will really get you to thinking. 4 Stars"
3,"Slow Start, Fine Details","Attention to detail makes this a good read. Crichton's research into the Medieval period is extremely impressive, and his imagery is vivid. The only trouble is, the book takes forever to get started. If you can make it through the wordy beginning, you'll have a rollicking good time. I wonder why Crichton and Robin Cook both take forever to set you up for the story. We don't need all that information!"
5,A must Read!,"Michael Crichton spins a wonderful tale. When reading you become engaged in the story..Surprise, oh I cant even go through all the great attributes of this book. It made me feel alive..only the way a good book can excite your mind, challenge it..then entertain and totally delight you. Believe me it was a joy reading it. I bet you will enjoy it immensely..you wont regret getting this book.sincerely."
2,"Crichton Blows It, Big Time!","I was enjoying this as a light holiday weekend entertaining read until when I came to page 209. Sir Daniel shows Chris that in the distance, Arnaut de Cervole's company is encamped ""no more than fifteen miles distant"". Miles? MILES? Since when was ""miles"" in the occitan vocabulary? Now I'm wondering if I should even bother finishing it. Sorry, but this slip just looses it for me. Who edits this stuff anyway?"
2,A 400 page car chase.,"With about 50 pages to go, I gave up on this one, not caring what happened to any of the boring heroes and villains of this tedious, repititious work.I love time travel science fiction, but even so, this book did little to excite me. About all we learn about the inhabitants of fourteenth century France is that they were a bunch of vicious barbarians, albeit more advanced scientifically than we might have thought. Otherwise, the parts of the book set in the past are a long and tiresome series of contrived near-disasters and escapes that eventually blend together to where they're indistinguishable. The amoral executives of the scientific company set in the present day are stock action movie characters.This is not one of Michael Crichton's better efforts."
1,Crightonesque: predictable page-turning action,"What an interesting subject ot write about, but about two hundred pages into the book, I knew exactly what was going to happen: the man enthralled by these times wants to -and does- stay behind; everybody past the first one hundred pages survives throughout the rest of the book; all but the enthralled man make it back safe. Maybe Mr. Chrichton should have just written a physics journal or something, because these incredibly thin plots became stale some time ago. He has so much promise (Sphere, in my opinion, ranking in the upper echelon of fiction)! But I just do not see why the story in this case must be so damn simple. It would have been so nice for the complexity of the story to match that of the subject. Sorry, Mr. Crichton; with all due respect, I disliked this novel. But I will say that he attempts to innovate subjectwise with every book he writes, and this is beyond commendable."
2,Not what I hoped it would be.,"The book is ok, it just didn't lead up to something amazing. The book had a LOT of downsides.1)It has too much dialogue. Some of the chapters have a lot of blathering.2)Not enough violence. I wanted to learn more about the Hundred Years War.3)Sometimes it's TOO long. It has the average length of a Frank Herbert novel.It seems that Michael Crichton didn't take too much time on this book. I think he wrote it for money. However, the ending of the book was very nice. I only reccomend this book for historians and scientists. Rating:Mature. End."
4,"Great book from Crichton, as usual","I found this to be an excellent book. The pace moves right along and it is hard to put down. The premise might be stretching it a bit, but hey,...it could happen! I love the way Crichton writes; easy to read, to the point and he makes the technical stuff accessible to all readers. Its hard to rate this against his other books because they all are equally great. You won't be disappointed to buy this book."
4,Timeline typical Crichton,"Timeline is another cool-adventure-story-where-everything-goes-to-hell-as-Murphys-Law-takes-over from the most profuse writer of the niche genre, Michael Crichton. Quantum physics allow several midieval researchers to parallel universe, which basically means they can go back in time.The major portion of the plot is focused on the misadventures of the time travelers, but side essays on quantum physics are thrown in every few chapters or so. It is interesting to see Crichton's vision of the past, but it does not match up to Crichton best.Overall Timeline is a good read for anyone has enjoyed other Crichtons books, or suspence novels in general."
2,DR WHO AND THE MAD GREEN KNIGHT,"I have always enjoyed Michael Crichton books, they are great page-turning stories that seem to grip you in a way that forbids you from putting them down. They never have very interesting characters, but their blandness in the past have been over compensated by some of the most original,. Thought provoking twists and turns. Timelime will not let you stop reading, once you start.... But when you get to the end and you reflect...oh dear! This basically a great Dr. Who story, not a bad thing in itself but unfortunately this is marketed to a adult audience .... So 5stars if you are 8- 13 years old, 2stars 15 plus years old.... Disagree ? all I can say is The Mad Green Knight Who Lives Is The Magic Cave, I rest my case."
3,Well developed,"Overall I thought the book was pretty interesting. Some parts were a little slow at first,but sped up later on and got better. Michael Crichton did a good job on the deatil and explaining the parts about science, which helped me to understand more."
1,Writing A Screenplay,"While the concept is interesting at the beginning of the book, and offers potential, the book unfortunately degenerates into a bad movie screenplay. Michael, if you want to write a screenplay do so, but don't try to publish it as an interesting read. The stuntmen are already warming up for the first take."
2,Cartoonish,"I was disappointed. Having read all of his other books, and being very interested in both physics & mediaeval history, I thought I'd love this book. The science parts are interesting, and the history seems well researched, but the plot lets it down. The whole story seemed to be one sword fight after another. The characterisations seemed a bit cartoonish and one dimensional too, with the evil and brusque corporation head, the wise college professor, the college students who are having the adventure (including the brainy kid, the girl, the leader, & the love-sick guy), and the nasty soldiers who are plotting evil plots. They Must Be Stopped! Before It's Too Late! Pass me a bucket...Mind you, with all the action going on, I did keep turning the pages. But once it was finished, I didn't feel like I'd read a great book. All in all, if this is turned into a movie, it will be rated G, play in the school holidays, and will sell many action figures."
2,One big bloody chase scene; one big bloody disappointment,"As I read Crichton's latest novel, I couldn't help but have a sense of deja vu. Hmmm...where have I heard this story before? I know! In a CHILDREN'S BOOK! Ever read ""How I Faced the Hampshire Mauler"" from Max and Me and the Time Machine by Gery Greer and Bob Ruddick? Well, the jousting tournament,the knight dressed in black and even the sensations felt by the characters while being transported are strikingly similar. I looked forward to Timeline with great anticipation, but was truly disappointed that Crichton saw fit to develop nothing more than a brutal, disgusting, head-lopping chase scene instead of his characters. Crummy plot and shallow characters...just the right ingredients for a mainstream cinema hit. Crichton really seems to have opted in favor of writing fodder for Hollywood; too bad any quality is nonexistent."
4,Good Recreational Reading,"I read this book over a weekend and found it very readable and enjoyable. Although the pseudoscience presented to explain time travel was pure witchery, most of the novel was spent on the parallel stories of the time travellers' adventures in 14th century France and conflict between a ruthless entrepreneur and his associates to get them back to the present before their 36-hour deadline ran out. It certainly provided enough excitement to keep me going. It also contained a few tidbits of medieval life that were fun for a history buff. I liked this book."
3,"Fun and Educational, but can get tedious at times","'Timeline' is a story that is mainly about a team of scientists who travel back to the middle ages to rescue their professor.The best part of the story is that weaves fact with fiction -- I found facsinating the author's description of the physics of time travel and his insights into life in Medieval France.Unfortunately, the bulk of the plot revolves around the 'good guys' running away from the 'bad guys', with nothing much else of substance.Anyway I have read quite a few of Mr. Crichton's books and I would rate this as average -- good for vacation reading and picking up a few tidbits about the physics of time travel and medieval life, but don't expect much more."
4,Good Book TERRIBLE movie,"I really enjoyed this book, the footnotes and afterward made it even better. The concept of the Multi-verse is so fascinating for anyone who questions what is wrong with the universe.The concepts about the age of knights are very thought provoking.I kept thinking when I read this book the first time; this would make a cool movie. Oops! I forgot that you have to dumb down the science for the public, and since that was what the book was all about, the movie was a disaster, one of the worst I've seen. So sad."
2,Sloppy,The title covers most of what I have to say. The book is OK but far from great. A good editor would have been a big help but it is too late for that so I advise you to pass on this one or get it from the library.
3,Quantum events don't have a timeline!!!,"This was a fairly good yarn, except for the attempt at mixing science with fiction. On the one hand, they go to excruciating details on getting you to buy into the science behind quantum events. Then at the end of the book, they have tied a one-to-one correlation between the 14th century ""characters"" events with the modern day ""lab"" events. Both are true in relation to their own time, but there is NO relation between the two timelines! What is keeping them from going back for the protagonists 5, 10, or 15 years later? Yet, to make ""Drama"" Michael ties the two timelines together as a single time. I can just hear the physicists yelling, ""Why are you hurrying??? Order a new window, wait the two months!!!""On the whole, read this with a HUGE grain of salt. It is a good story, but Mr. Crichton should have not tried to explain the science behind it if he is not going to stay with it!"
2,I Weep For The Future,"This was the first Michael Crichton novel I've read. It will be the last.The man cannot write a well-written phrase to save his life. His characterizations are blander than store-brand generic chicken soup. I just love how all the main characters are never much older than 30--so as to fit the desired demographics for movie casting. There was hardly a single distinguishable character with a unique personality in this entire, flavorless book. The cookie-cutter got quite a workout on this one.Here I was naively believing that an author who has had as much acclaim and success as Crichton surely must be able to wordcraft with at least a reasonable level of competence. No such luck."
1,silly,"Silly, silly, silly. Little science and no character development. Save your money and read Sharon Kay Penman. I wish I could give it no stars."
2,Disappointed,"The concept is great, but I found this book to be pretty boring. The situations seemed contrived and the book reads like it was intended for an adolescent audience. Not up to the standards that Chrichton set with Andromeda Strain and others."
4,"Good story, far out main premise",Extremely far out premise for 'time' travel. But that's classic science fiction at its best.Fairly beleiveable characters. Good action.Chapel of Green Death is an obvious hypothetical source for Sir Gwain and the Green Knight tale. Very reminiscent of concept of Eaters of the Dead; in writing a 'true story' of the basis of a legend...
5,This one got me started,"I was given this book last year as a gift. I read it and immediately was thrilled with this book!! Since being given this wonderful book, I've read Clancy, Harris, Grisham, Pat Conroy, and several others - as well as other Crichton works - and this is the only book I've ever re-read! It is excellent. The imagery he's developed is remarkable. The characters are super. The plot is thrilling fun! Like with other Crichton works, you feel educated when done. I have recommended this book to everyone I've met. And am now doing so to you.Buy the book and get ready for a wild, exciting, and engrossing ride!"
4,A decent book,"Michael Crichton is usually a safe bet for a fast page turner. The concept of going back in time is surely not a new premise for a book, yet Michael Crichton adds his unique flavor to the concept with his own style of writing. Since its publication I have seen countless movies and read many books which have this same concept as the core theme to the storyline. I am sure this would have been better enjoyed if I read it when it first came out, though I would surely recommend this book to anybody. There is nothing new in the book, but entertaining nonetheless.Four out of five stars."
4,Typical Crichton with an interesting and detailed take on Medievel life!,"In short, this book held me every step of the way. Great fiction? Probably not, but I loved Crichton's alternate take on medievel life. Very detailed. Also, very different from the movie in many ways. The novel is superior. Those who enjoy this period of history will find this novel VERY interesting. Definitely worth a read."
2,What happened to the thrill?,"Timeline is definitely not one of Crichton's best works, but it isn't horrible either. I give brownie points to the author for trying to create a 'thriller' out of theoretical quantum mechanics, but he tried too hard to make such a complex theory accessible to any Joe on the street . I realize that is what bestselling authors are supposed to do to entertain the audience, but it lowered the rank of this book considerably in my mind. While the medeival scenes were often engaging and enjoyable to read, the characters of the students (Kate, Andre, and Chris) were quite annoying and unconvincing. Their adventures were beyond far-fetched and unlikely, and most of their exploits smacked of your typical Saturday morning cartoon where the good guys always end up winning by some miraculous intervention. So, although Crichton is one of my favorite authors, his attempt at quantum time travel in this novel was fairly feeble and unpersuasive."
5,Time Travel and Knights. Now that's an Adventure...,I will be the first to admit I don't read much. It takes a lot to capture my attention. TIMELINE did it for me! I loved the way Crichton described the Quantum Travel device and the unfolding landscape our band of time travelers found themselves in. I was there with them! Read this book - you won't be disappointed!
2,Very Disappointing,"While I usually love reading Michael Crichton's books, this one was a disappointment for me. I did not find it up to the author's usual high standards. The story was not as captivating, and the background information Crichton usually includes, enabling readers to be further educated as well as entertained, was in limited supply. I felt like the author was more interested in writing a preliminary screenplay than a good publication. This is one Crichton book I would NOT recommend."
3,Quantum? What's that?,"I don't know if anybody has understood the ten page explanation about quantum physics. I guess it's time travelling (again) and that`s all. The problem with the book is that just when it should become thrilling (arrival at 1357), it develops into a nothing-more-than-an-adventure-novel. Just in case nobody has claimed: Crichton writes thinking of the movie: any candidate for Chris and Kate characters? Ah! Don't get lost in multiverse, he, he"
2,Great Beginnings..........But,The first 1/3 of the book was mesmerizing but the last 1/3 was very poorly written. This is an ambitious topic (one worth exploring) but the ending really is ridiculous. Was he late for an appointment when he finished the book? Could have been huge!
2,"Deja vu, all over again","This is a modernized version of an oft-told time travel story--this time into the 14th century. The modernization is replacement of imaginary time travel by imaginary ""multi-universe"" travel. It depends on the modern speculation of multiple parallel concurrent versions of the universe.The conventional time travel story is interlarded with paragraphs from by-now-equally-conventional summaries of the multi-universe speculation associated with quantum physics. If the book contains any new ideas, I could not find them!"
3,Seems to be written with the intent of turning it into a movie,"I would actually give this a 3.5 stars. The story is interesting, and moves at a breakneck pace. Unfortunately because it's all plot, no time is spent to develop the characters. I wish there would have been more time at the beginning that would build up the suspense. It was a fun read and maybe someday it will turn into a movie. Update - so it became a movie back in 2003. Maybe I'll rent it one day..."
4,Good read,"A good story that is backed up with reasonable historiography. One of Crichtons best. The film version , although truncated in story lines, also worth a view."
4,Wow never thought school would make me read a good book,Timeline was a wonderful book to me becuase I really enjoy books and movies about the feudal period of Europe. The epic tales of Knights and their chivalry always intrigued me. Timeline helped me explore a brand new perspective of that chivalristic period by taking the true chivalry out and leaving only the truly barbaric and inhumane behaviors that were feudal France. I also enjoyed how Mr. Crichton weaved science into his story to give it sense of reality. Also the way he showed how pathetical the physical well being of our age actually is. Marek was near what a doctor of the present would call a perfect physical specimen and he could barely put up a good fight against Sir Guy. I more than recomend this book to any one who has an interest in the inner workings of feudal France. This book is the first book that I ever read for school that I actually enjoyed picking up when I got home from my day.
5,"dude, this book rocks","ok, i may only be a 14 year old freshman in high school but this book just rocks. i love the way crichton intertwines all the history, science and everything else in an exciting plot. i've read other techno-thriller type books by clancy and other authors and this book trumps them ALL. i'm not gonna spoil the ending for you but its not as ""predictable"" as the other dude put it (me being a teen may play some part in it :0 ) i had to read it all in one night 'cuz i just did not want to put it down and i had to know what happened next. as a reference, i think its alot better than most of his other books. go read this book now. i'd give it 10 stars if i could."
2,"Starts OK, fades fast","The book starts off well and hooks you for awhile. But then Crichton loses control. The story contradicts itself in many places -- its almost as if Crichton took many breaks in writing the book and forgot what he had written in previous chapters.About half way through the book you'll will want to toss this one in the garbage.No doubt, this will be a movie. I'd skip the book and just wait for the movie."
2,Literary cheese,"The title of this book should have been ""Timeline: The Movie"", because that's what it is. In fact, according to Crichton's official site, the movie rights have already been secured and it's a go for 2002!Don't expect ""The Andromeda Strain"" or even ""Jurassic Park"". This is a mildly enjoyable page-turner featuring cardboard cutout characters and shaky science (that isn't explained well, even if it is plausible). Will be forgotten the day after you finish it."
2,Have you read a good movie lately?,"I just read a movie - lots of action, a varied group of characters, exciting settings. I could visualize the ""clean room"" laboratories of the scientists and the dusty castles of the middle ages all in living color on the big screen with a full orchestral soundtrack stirring the adrenaline with each page - or is it each scene? I've loved Crichton since I devoured Andromeda Strain in one sitting many years ago. But, he's gotten a little too slick. I should have waited for the movie. Oh well, some director will surely outdo my imagination."
3,Not spectacular fare from a write who can do better,"If you liked Jurassic Park and Sphere, that is no guarantee you will like Timeline. The scientific jargon ends early on, and a good 3/4 of the book is simply the main characters running around 14th century France, luckily jumping from one adventure to the next. A bit contrived, if you ask me. The dialogue is not convincing, and neither are the characters or plot. The setting, however, is excellent."
3,Crichton's Timeline,"I've read quite a few of Michael Crichton's books. I'm also quite a fan of the time travel genre. I naturally assumed this would be a fantastic combination, however I was somewhat disappointed with ""Timeline"". Although it was an enjoyable read, it seemed way off Crichton's usual writing style, and I had a hard time associating Crichton with actually having written this novel. It's good for checking out of the library, but I wouldn't add it to my personal collection. I agree with a earlier reviewer who said it seemed like it was written with movie motives."
3,Interesting but not up to Crichton standards.,"It is rare that I finish reading a book and find myself conflicted on my opinion of it, but this is my dilemma with Timeline. While more of a science fiction fan than a history fan, I enjoyed the medieval time travel element quite a bit. It was engaging and had quite a lot of action to keep me interested. The jumping back and forth between past and present kept the suspense at a relatively steady pace. My disappointments were its over-reliance on technical information (which made for some dry reading at times), and its characters who, while not UNlikeable, just didn't make me care much what happened to them (except for Marek, who I really liked). Having read almost every other book Crichton has written, I just didn't feel this was up to his usual standards. However, if you are interested in the medieval period, Crichton's extensive bibliography alone would probably be worth the price of the paperback."
3,"Crichton, King of the Mass Market Novel...","What can I say?Crichton writes books that are wild, imaginative, thrilling, and fun. TIMELINE is no exception even if it does borrow the skeleton of JURASSIC PARK.This time around, you've got a rich guy who's busy trying to design theme parks around time travel. He sends a group of archaeologists and historians back in time... where they get stuck in the medieval dark ages, where they must survive for the next few days until they can make it back home. If that's even possible.Crichton wastes no time in getting the story going and, while characterization may be slim, the story races along quickly, pulling the reader forward in time as the characters themselves struggle in a history they've known only through books.A great little romp and a fun little read."
2,I would pass on this one.,"I bought this book with high expectations. I typically like this type of story (time travel, sci fi, etc) but in the end I was pretty disappointed with the book.The plot once they head back in time goes on this tear of running from one escapade to another, except the flow doesn't make sense. They just seem to bounce from one thing to another, the character development doesn't make much sense, people do these bizarre things for no apparent reason. I did finish the book, but I wouldn't bother to read it again or reccommend it to others.This book could have been so much more, which is perhaps why I found it so disappointing. Sorry, liked his other books, but not this one."
2,Crichton Took a Day Off!,"What I look forward to in a Crichton novel is his ability to make the unimaginable seem real, and his ability to create three dimensional charecters that are ready to step off the page. That didn't happen here. It seemed to me that he simply put together a product for the year 2000. The second star is for the research, not for the plot. It was predictable, even as to who would stay behind. Usally I have to force my self to but down a Crichton novel, with this one I had force my self to finish."
3,"it's all a bit silly, really",crichton's latest is eminently readable in his usual page-turner way. it provides a fascinating insight into life in 12th century france. it's probably thoroughly accurate in that respect too. but there's something about modern day people clowning around in middle age costumes saying forsooth and hey nonny nonny that makes you embarrassedly look up from the page every now and then to check nobody in the subway car has seen you. crichton has always dwelled challengingly on the border between what is possible and what is yet beyond the grasp of science. here a considerably larger than usual measure of disbelief suspension is required for the enjoyment of this otherwise quite thrilling thriller.
2,Worst Crichton Book Yet!,I am a Crichton fan and have read most of his books. Timeline missed the mark by far. A couple of decent chapters but I found the book to be pretty boring. I had a hard time finishing this piece. Are we sure Crichton really wrote this book?
3,Made for the Movies...,"It has an interesting premise and seems well researched, but this novel was clearly intended as a screenplay. Fun, but perhaps we should wait for the movie."
5,GREAT!,This was a phenomenal book - could NOT put it down! It took me 14 straight hours to complete & it was worth every minute. Looking forward to the next Michael Crichton book..........
2,This is a movie in the making!,"I had to read this as it was the monthly selection for my book club. I had never read a Michael Crichton book before, so I had nothing to compare it to. I found the book enjoyable to some degree, but thought the believability factor went out the window almost immediately. It as almost as if the author was trying to go over the readers' heads with all the quantum physics references so that we wouldn't question the storyline. The characters had no real depth and there were far too many characters, especially in the medieval parts. The characters cheated death too many times for their escapes to have any kind of credibility. Also, let's face it, would a person with the personality of Doniger really be so far ahead and have so many loyal employees in the real world? The book was pretty enjoyable in parts, but it's not going to make me want to pick up another Crichton book in a hurry."
2,"Unfortunately, another perfect example of Chrichton","I will give Mr. Chrichton this: he is without a doubt the most original thinker in modern American fiction. The ideas he spawns (and the detailed research her performs) are excellent. His books, however, never seem to finish the race. Almost always, I am completely caught in his web at the beginning and then left unsatisfied at the end. Timeline is no exception.This book is a fascinating idea, and the first half moves purposefully toward character development. Unfortunately, it then turns into Die Hard sans Bruce Willis. If the books was 200 pages longer, he may have been able to develop the characters more and bring the book to a natural ending. Now, it is predictable (completely) and has a huge leap of logic and development at the end.The bottom line is that while I enjoyed the book somewhat, it was more for the idea than for the execution...something I could have gotten from the jacket."
4,"""Timeline""","A great novel/history lesson, Crichton makes another edge-of-your-seat adventure.Three young arcaeologists travel back in time to Medieval France to save their history professor from the cuthroat rebels of the era. It's full of surprises that will just jump on you. It's a book your bound to read in one shot!"
2,Been Done Better and can you say plagerism?,"Other than the nonsensical techno-babble about Quantam Physics, this is very familiar stuff if you have read Heinlein. Substitute an Android for Merek, and Ancient Gaul and the Romans for Middle Ages France and it is almost character for character and even gizmo for gizmo. Including the ear mounted communicator translator. And, the modern bad guy, who is romping around even badder back there. I don't think that Hollywood can make something even remotely watchable out of this turkey."
3,...and I'm a big Crichton fan....,"""Timeline"" reads, unfortunately, like a movie. It does a wonderful job of bringing history to life. It is confusing at times, and leaves several things unexplained.Action packed (too much), light, fluffy, politically correct. Weak ending.I fear Crichton has abandoned me, and slightly insulted me in the process (first Lost World and now this).He is an incredibly talented thinker and storyteller. So what happened?Please tell me why I should ever read another book by him."
2,Just wait for the movie....,"I was very disappointed by the latest book of Michael Crichton, of whom I am a great fan. What I appreciated in his earlier books was the capacity to treat various issues (about society, science, ethics) in a highly entertaining way. But his latest book seams to have been wrote more for the movie that inevitable will follow rather than to convey some idea. The story is packed with action and centered on a group of American students sent beck to Medieval Europe. But the ploy is weak and highly predictable, with the group going through fights with Medieval knights as easily as having a game of Ping Pong, and ultimately the story start to repeat it-self, with the end where ""the bad guy"" will pay for his arrogance."
2,Not a good one!,I am sorry - I tried reading this one but found it was awful! Storyline started off great but by the middle of the book I had had enough! Very disappointing cause I think Michael Crichton could have done so much better!
2,hmmmmm....,"Entertaining story...yet overdone in many ways. It evolves into a total action movie, with one action sequence after another, and too many James Bond type improbable escapes and incredibly lucky breaks...basically not something you would expect from Crichton. Also, scientifically the concepts were cloudy at best. My 2 stars are for idea."
4,A good audio book,"I bought the unabridged Audio Book version of Timeline and was completely entertained. I do not particularly care for Medieval History, but I found myself unable to wait for the next opportunity to listen to one of the tapes.However, I am willing to bet that I would have skimmed the written word version. I can picture it being tedious."
3,Had its moments.,"Timeline was written around some interesting concepts like quantum computers, interdimentional time travel and what it was like 650 years ago. It had its moments where in Crichton's explanations of these concepts I was hooked.However, the plot was weak and the story wasn't realy well written. It seemed that he hastily came up with an end to it."
2,Huge letdown,"A rather boring book. Draws attention to what is possibly interesting science, however unable to hold the readers interest in the plot. The book just drags on forever. Have to agree with some other readers that this book seems to have been written with a movie script in mind. Skip this book...save some time, energy and money"
2,"Its a comedy, right?","I really can't say much about this book as the story doesn't have enough substance to critic but if they do make it into a movie I hope they go for the comedy genre. The guy who had the lead in the 1999 movie ""The Mummy"" would be great for one of the leads."
3,A Disappointment,"As a fan of both Crichton and historical fiction, I found this book very disappointing. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it. Timeline is fast-paced and contains plenty of made-for-Hollywood and/or computer games violence and scenarios. The character development is minimal, however, and will require the assistance of some very talented actors to make Crichton's two-dimensional figures come to life.The historical reconstruction is equally shallow, with all events taking place in a theme-park medieval France devoid of all but bloodthirsty knights, fair (but appropriately feminist) maidens, and pious monks. Crichton's previous attempts at historical reconstruction (Eaters of the Dead, The Great Train Robbery) were more successful. His failure here results in a book that kept me turning the pages as much out of mirth as from suspense.I can't wait for the movie!"
5,One of Crichton's Best!,"Timeline's 444 pages flew by in a little over 1 1/2 days! I have read all of Crichton's books and would consider this to be among the best. If you've always been fascinated by the prospect of time travel, and are interested in learning a little mid evil history, this is the way to go. Definitly one of those books which I would have been happy to keep reading and am a little saddened to have finished so quickly."
2,dissapointing,"This is the first Crichton book I have read, and it may just be the last. The plotlines in this are so obvious from the beginning. Some of the tech stuff is fairly interesting, but there are so many holes in the plot that it ruins the entire book. Crichton needed to think some of his theories through a bit more before he put them in print. Although he tries to make a true represtentation of the past, he throws some fantasy in there with the seven foot insane giant and 'transcription' errors that don't make any sense."
3,Wait for the movie,"This story seriously lacks character development. It becomes even more sketchy when the protagonists travel back in time. However, as the outline for a movie it is sufficient. The action alone will carry the movie. Suffice it to say, it isn't enough to sustain the story. After reading it, I couldn't help but think ""who were these people, and who cares?"" You'll be better served if you wait for the movie, rather than being disappointed by this story."
2,A Movie Script in Novel Form,"Much like the other reviewers, I found the book to have a good start, and some interesting concepts, and certainly a good glimpse into quantum physics. But what a disapponting back half of the book. Michael wrote a screen play and called it a novel. What a shame on his talent and the subject matter."
4,Crichton's insightful comment right on target.,"This book was more action-oriented than I'd like, but the plot and science/science fiction were enough to keep me interested.Toward the end of the book, I found one comment to be as insightful as it is ironic: Crichton notes that in our modern society, the culture's supreme ideal is entertainment. It permeates everything -- from politics to education, and everything in between. This, from he who has mastered and exploited this penchant of ours."
1,Ghostwritten by committee!,"Once again, Dr. Crichton has turned out a book he seems to have only edited, and apparently didn't personally write.Read it, and you will find that the writing style changes frequently. The book only occasionally shows a Crichton-ish twist of plot.Also, the story is very bizarre and often incredible (even if you grant the basic premise of time travel). And much of it reads like a bad screenplay.But who can blame him? If I were as rich as he, I'd stop writing, too!"
2,Prepared for the movie screen,"When I first saw this book I was excited to see a Crichton book incorporating another highly scientific concept (quantum theory) into an adventure story. As I read I was disappointed in the glib nature of the action in the book.It seemed that every section was trying to have a cliff-hanger ending. Like I was watching a made for TV movie right before a commercial. Also, the actions of the characters didn't make logical sense in many cases.Many times I felt like I was back in Jr. High reading a role-playing fantasy book. Not enough depth.The two things I did like were 1) the concept and 2) the ending. It also gave me a layman's understanding of quantum mechanics.When compared to Jurassic Park and some of Crichton's past novels, this one just doesn't cut it. Overall, I think he has seen the money and knows how to write to make a strong movie, not a strong book."
2,Good idea quickly fades,"Mr. Chrichton, always inventive, has a good idea in this book. Unfortunately, he has become so used to writing movies that he actually cuts this thing up like a movie and at the same time turns it into a chase instead of a story.I missed seeing Mr. Crichton explore the universe (or multiverse) in which he has placed his characters. I think he actually used the scene where someone starts sliding over a cliff (a la Jurassic Park) three times! It's very weak in this respect and really destroys what should have been a good read.Mr. Crichton doesn't lack skill or intelligence, but he has become too used to the Hollywood perspective, and he has lost or misplaced his storytelling sense.EKW"
4,"A good read, in spite of itself","Am I the only reviewer who was reminded of the TV show Sliders? Right down to the Professor, the girl, and two younger men. I wonder if Crichton had been watching this TV series when he got the idea for the book. I did enjoy the story, in spite of the predictability, and the never-ending cliffhangers. I found myself almost overwhelmed by so much action; there was never a dull moment. The historical aspects were a plus, and Crichton did manage to accomplish what only a very good writer can: he kept me turning the pages!"
5,Intriguing,I really enjoyed TIMELINE. I was leery buying it because it sounded toooo far fetched. But he did a great job as usual. The quantam theory is rather exciting to consider. I look forward to his next book.
3,Something of a disappointment,"Not one of Crichton's better efforts. This is a really good story of time travel, but it isn't well handled. Suspense is weak; deus ex machinas seem to abound, especially in the last third of the book, and it reads as if it were hurriedly written, with too little attention devoted to resolving plot elements. Connie Willis' Doomsday Book, a similar story, is vastly superior in every respect."
2,"interesting premise, poor execution","Timeline started out well--a group of academics are sent back to France in the Middle Ages and must survive until they are returned to the present--but it quickly became boring and tedious to read. Page after page, the characters were constantly fighting for their lives as they encountered a ridiculous number of contrived mishaps, accidents, and villains. After surviving so many deadly situations, you knew they were going to be alright and return to the present, but with such a predictable plot, you couldn't feel any tension and anxiety for the characters. Crichton did a good job of describing what it must have been like to live in France during the Hundred Years War, but he forgot to include a good plot and interesting characters in his book. Total tedium."
2,Timeline at a Loss,"I have read everything this author has written and this falls way under his normal talent. I guess every author has a book that is not up to his talent this is it for him. The story is a good idea, but it fails without the little touches he has in all his books. The main thing that is different is it doesn't make you think. Where is the real interaction between the characters, They are friends, so what else are they to each other."
3,Weak effort,"All in all, I was disappointed with Timeline. The writing is fair, the technology is not explained to pull you in. There is a bit of humor in this one which I did enjoy. I do think it is a formula book from a writer who had given up trying to create something great. It is a shame because Jurassic Park and other Crichton books have that spark. Sure it's a fast read - but not entirely satisfying."
3,Could have been much better,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, that was about the first and the last 100 pages. The middle just seemed a little on the slow side. I would still recommend the book; it's just not one of his best."
4,Jurassic Park goes Medievel,I'll say I did enjoy the read - especially the first half. There were some surprises and a sense of anticipation. The last half was interesting - especially if you're into the medievel time period - but predictable. I was very disappointed in the ultimate purpose for the time travel technology - not very original for an author of Crighton's caliber.
2,Jurassic Park Rehash,"This book was simply Jurassic Park except instead of bringing creatures from the past to the present it puts creatures from the present into the past. If you read the book, it is obvious to see the similarities, though I don't reccomend reading the book. The only thing I got out of it was the interesting historical information, but the crazy, and extremely annoying thing about the historical info was that he would have a few historical paragraphs, then have that information interrupted by plot action, and he would enver finish saying what he started. There is no suspense in the lack of a setting, I dont know what he was trying for there. The science is somewhat fictionalized, but there is a very slight chance of it being possible, as in jurassic park. Overall, this book was a disappointment, and I do not reccomend it."
2,Not as bad as it could have been,"I write this at the risk of it being lost in the noise, but it's worth it. I'll keep it short: yes, it's a light ""beach read"" kind of book, but it's not so bad. There are a couple of interesting ideas and a little action to keep you awake on the plane. I also happened to read this book right after Connie Willis' terrific ""The Doomsday Book"", which has a similar setup, but is much better. Read it if ""Timeline"" wasn't all you were hoping for."
3,Movie will be better than book,"This book was a disappointment. Although, I think that I will like the movie because so much of the book requires the visual senses. Michael Crichton is a gifted writer and one that I generally enjoy but this was not one of his best works."
3,Perfect Summer Read,"One thing about Michael Crichton's books is that you learn something new every time. In Timeline, you get a crash course in life and death in 14th Century France. Our heroes venture there via an ingenious time travel device to rescue thier comrade. Of course, things go wrong quickly and the rescue proves a bit more difficult than expected. A page turner, definitely."
5,"Quantum technology, time travel, AMAZING","This book is the first of Crichton's which I've read, and I must say its simply amazing. He makes the possibilities of quantum physics seem so real! Some of the characters are not too developed, but the plot itself and the sci-fi aspects easily overshadow this small imperfection. This novel should definitely be the next movie based on one of Crichton's works. Amazing sci-fi, emotions, this is one to read!"
3,Not up to Crichton Standards!!!,"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, and this was not up to his standards. This book was written to be a movie, plain and simple.I bought this book at an airport on my way to California. It is good plane reading when you can just throw it out the window and read something else.The people in the book are plastic, and story has far too many twists. The fist 100 pages are great, as are the last 10. It is the middle 350 that I have a problem with."
1,Can I go back in time - before I wasted it on reading this?,"""Timeline"" is nothing more than a rewrite of ""Jurrasic Park,"" all the way down to the motives of the evil industrialist. Formula through and through - don't waste your time."
3,Good....but implausible,"I am usually enthralled and consequently educated by Michael Crichton's work but this was not his best. Too much research? That may have been his downfall because it felt as if he was constantly trying to implement all the facts and theories concerning time travel. Unless you are educated in the field, it is nearly impossible to follow the scientific rhetoric throughout the novel. I may understand the concept but I was often times lost in the ""simplifying"" of the ideas. All in all, I would say that this book was entertaining but it was definitely tainted by inconsistencies in the plot."
4,A Superb Read!,"This isn't the best book in the world. It is however an energetic, enthralling one. It took me no time, practically, to read it.There is more to the novel than the speed. Crichton, as I saw it, was trying to show different aspects of our civilization through the characters and their actions. He represented how many people have kind of lost touch with our surroundings, how we can't really defend ourselves. The middle ages were a hard time to be living in, more difficult than ours in many ways. Crichton, I think, succeeded in presenting that to the reader. He didn't exaggerate, he didn't invent wild ""facts."" Most all historical mistakes aren't anything to complain too much about. They were made for literary reasons, to help the pace of the story.And, of course, Crichton displayed the dangers of technology; it's become kind of a habit with him."
4,None stop excitment,"Crichton has really done his homework and the setting in 14th century France is brough to life for the reader. If you can over look a few weak explinations about time travel and related issues that are not too convincing, you can really enjoy this book. The pace is frantic and once in a while I heard myself even shouting to the characters as they constantly encounter one life threatening problem after another. A classic cliff hanger."
2,Narrow Escape Literature,"The Hardy Boys team with Nancy Drew and battle Midaevil men with halitosis. The first part of the book is modestly entertaining, explaining the physics of time travel. The second is full of nothing so much as Hollywood cliche. Crichton doesn't really write the second half--he experiments with narrow escapes (we're SO surprised---Frank and Joe emerge aLIVE!) to see which one Spielberg might favor in the inevitable movie. The villains and good guys are so predictably drawn that you almost hear the Bernard Hermann music strike up when one of them menacingly scratches his chin. It's just all too silly and it's all been done before--just ask Franklin W. Dixon. Wait for the movie, then wait for the video."
5,Timeline,"This book was amazing. I have never been able to complete a book about medival times or a sci-fi book, so this was quite new for me. Like a good book, i was unable to put it down."
2,A major disappointment,"I have always been a big fan of Mr Crichton's work, and as such was very sorry to find that not only COULD I put this book down, I did, frequently. I can't help but think that a possibly great story line slipped through his fingers."
1,Boring,"I'm a crichton fan. Bought this book after all the hype I read in the magazines and bcos I love crichton's writings. However, it was a big letdown. It was plain simple boring. Was very hard to read and finish this book."
2,"It's one of countless action movies, not a book","There is no technical or sciece fiction in this book except for the word ""quantum"" about five times a page, approriate or not. Nothing to learn about medieval France either. What you'll find in this book is what you see in action movies: chases with last second rescues and not much more.If you want to read about time travel, get a copy of The Time Machine by H.G.Wells."
1,"Starts out good, but falls apart","This book starts out interestingly enough, but the plot quickly falls apart into a series of chases and near death escapes that are boring and completely unbelievable (for about 300 pages). The characters are flat and almost seem to be cartoons. I think the book's premise was a good idea, but Crighton did not pull it off. Will probably make a good mindless, bloody movie, though."
3,"Stunning level of reserach, shallow on story or plot.","OK, so, anyone who just glances at the bibliography for this science fiction book should be very impressed. I was. But, after finishing it, I was also a bit disappointed at the story overall. Maybe I'm being cynical, but Crichton is a wonderfully inventive, and interesting writer whose subjects are unusual in the sci-fi world. He writes about real science, in a scientific fictional way. That's cool. What's not, is when the story isn't up to the level of research he's put into the book, nor the time I've invested in reading it.As the Emperor says, ""So Be It."" It's an OK read, not something to go out and buy immediately. Wait for the paperback (cheaper) version..."
1,Save your time and money,"Timeline is awful, the usual blend of cardboard characters and page eating paragraph and short chapter techniques.The attempts at creating tension are laughable. If Crichton ever does something unpredictable he might achieve a little tension. But since he does not, you know what's going to happen before it happens.I bit on this one after reading a review in the New York Times Book Review. Having read Timeline and compared my impression with the reviewer's I can only conclude the fix is in -- somewhere there's money changing hands.Timeline is tired and stiff, and deserves one behind the ear.I confess I tried it to see if Crichton had improved since Airframe. He has not, and now joins Robin Cook on my list of writers still dining out on their first book.Readers of the world, rise up! Cast off your chains and demand a good story and characters you care about, not this swill written by a band of monkeys."
1,A paint-by-the-numbers effort,"Crichton is intelligent and well educated, qualities that are manifest in his story lines and in the technical details of his books. But he has a long way to go as a writer, a fact that is painfully evident here. The premise is interesting, but there is not a character real enough to care about and the writing is pedestrian. I simply lost interest half way through the book."
1,Tired Formula,"The plot and characters of this book, which is just Crichton's standard formula, are derived, contrived and absolutely predictable. The cast, for there is no doubt that this will be a movie, consists solely of cartoon characters, and the plot line is nothing more than unrelated ""Perils of Pauline"" type skits which are strung together in a flacid attempt to build tension and suspense leading to the contrived life or death deadline. This book would be good reading for ages 10 to 14."
2,a sloppy Jurassic Park retread -- wait for the paperback!,"This is the kind of book that I find myself reading despite myself. It's not very well written, but just entertaining enough to keep one involved. Crichton did it much better in Jurassic Park: Timeline is little more than a rewrite of Jurassic Park with castles instead of the theme park and vicious knights in armor instead of vicious dinosaurs. Unlike Jurassic Park, Timeline is not very well written and frequently absurdly implausible. Having spent my career in Silicon Valley, it's painfully obvious to me that Crichton hasn't the faintest clue of what high technology companies are like, and his plot contortions to set the scene reminded me of a bad high school creative writing assignment. The frequent injections of grotesque violence are clearly written with a future film version in mind: they provide little impact on the written page and add little to the story."
2,not worth owning,Save your money and wait for the movie. The book reads like a screenplay. Disappointing.
2,Weak,"TIMELINE starts out interestingly, and I had hopes for it, but it disintegrates into every time- machine-B-movie you've ever had to endure on the late late show that you were only watching because you had insomnia. And Crichton is ripping himself off here. JURASSIC PARK and THE LOST WORLD were fish-out-of-water-in-another-time (so to speak) books. Crichton directed the movie ""West World"" and THAT was a fish-out-of-water.... movie (suburbanites in the old west). And here it is again. I wouldn't mind Crichton mining the same vein, if he did it successfully. But since he's failing at it (""Westworld"" was his only successful attempt at that plot, I think), he should try a different plot on for size."
2,"Time travel is nasty, brutish, and short.","Crichton's latest movie script, masquerading as a novel, is another tedious formula book. I appreciated his overview of quantum technology, the possibility of multiverses, and his detailed research on medieval Europe. However, any book (or movie) that relies on a clock timer ticking backwards for suspense is inherently lame. The characters are moderately interesting, although mostly cliché and rarely compelling. Until Crichton demonstrates an ability to break free from this TV/movie-friendly writing, I will avoid his future work."
2,Movie will be better than the book,"Timeline was not terribly engaging. It would make a better comic book than it did a novel. There were so many cliffhangers and near disasters that suspension of belief began to wear thin. The action was swift and furious, without question, but I expected a different level of depth in character and plot development for a 400 page novel. Not Crichton's best, but I'm sure it'll make a blockbuster movie some day."
2,Mediocre!,I never developed any feel for the characters..couldn't (or didn't care) to even visualize any of them. And why did they need these historians to go get the Professor? I never could figure out the point.
3,Good start with a medicore middle and a poor ending,"I enjoyed the book very much, and Crichton once again shows off his technical know how and research abilities. The book is very interesting and the beginning is excellent, bringing you right into the book. Unfortunately, the middle gets very muddled, using too many characters and dragging out the actions of the main characters. Also, I felt like I was reading a Hardy Boys book because the main characters were constantly very close to being killed by the bad guys. The ending of the book is so boring it made the book almost not worth reading. After I finished the book I felt as if there were a few pages missing. I recommend this book for fans of Crichton, time travel enthusiasts, and fans of medeival history. Otherwise, save your money."
2,Should've made the movie and saved the trees,"Wel,, I started it and I finished it. And I was disappointed with the story and the characters. Exciting at the beginning, you soon lose yourself in the perils of the hansom and beautiful characters lost in Medevil times, along the ranting of the rich company owner with his slick lawyer and ex-military jack of all trades. Fell short of being a real great book, but a fun read if you are looking for something to waste the afternoon with."
1,Doomsday Book Redux,"Am I the only one who sees the more than striking similarity betweenTimeline and The Doomsday Book by Connis Willis? The church, the egocentric bad guy, the internal translater, oh no are we going to get back to the correct time period, etc, etc, etc. Where Crichton cannot seem to make the characters believable and three dimensional, Willis does....read the far superior Doomsday Book."
1,Jurassic Park with time travel,"That's not a compliment.I think Crichton took his manuscript of Jurassic Park, and did a search-and-replace with his word processor. The word ""dinosaur"" gets replaced with ""knight"", etc etc."
1,"Poor, hack writing","The technology Crighton describes is far more interesting than the drivel he put forth in this obviously 'for money' work. The storyline leaves no surprises, with the author often leaving this reader more bored than interested in the storyline. He obviously researched some of what he wrote into the book and gives a basic understanding of some of the concepts such as Quantum Mechanics and the history of twentieth century physics. However the characters are all very pale, and he follows a similar plot line to Sphere where #1. something happens #2 assemble a team of experts to fix the problem. BORRRRING! I really fell ripped off at this hack work and will not purchase another of Crightons future works."
1,Terrible,"Jurrasic Park had the excitement of pushing the envelope of science and technology in a direction of credibility. It may be years before something like that would be possible, but, certainly, someday it would be possible. None of that here. Parallel universes? In particular, dismissing the effect of an action in the past as having no relevance to the course of subsequent history? There is no science here, just a contrived bunch of nonsense reminiscent of The Celestine Prophecy. It is juvenile, pure science fiction without basis in any science at all. It is for children, except for all the violence. A real disappointment from an aouthor who was able to capture the imagination so effectively in Jurrasic Park."
3,Crichton Clones Self!,"After the fantastic success of Jurassic Park, why should Crichton mess around? Substitute quantum mechanics for DNA, and instead of bringing the past into the present, bring the present into the past!What you've got here is a very entertaining screenplay for a blockbuster action flick. Very enjoyable, very forgettable and very familiar. Don't look for much in the way of character development, although I did enjoy this cast more than the whining kids in Jurassic Park.Let the ancillary rights bidding begin!"
5,"Better than The Lost World by 20,000 miles!",If you want my 2 cents worth Timeline is the best historical fiction novel of the year--only The Killer Angels and The Triumph and the Glory come even close to matching it for raw excitement and unrelenting tension set in a vivid past. SUPER!
2,Airplane Pulp Entertainment,"I have never read another Crichton novel, and I was disappointed after reading Timeline, as I had expected more from his reputation. This felt like a Saturday Afternoon Special for adults. When we finally arrive at the evil plot that precipitated this huge adventure, it's anti-climatic at best and innane at worst. I think I see where he was going, a big-bucks-made-under-your-nose sort of thing. But I felt that it fell flat."
3,"Love the story, Hate the subject matter","I love Michael Cricthon, and all his novels. TIMELINE is a rip-roaring adventure, however the period of the Knights and the round table wasn't my favorite period, I did enjoy the jumping, fighting, explosions and the technical aspect but the history and language of the times made no never mind to me. But this is not to say that it was bad. I did like it. So SUE me."
5,Keeps you on the edge.,"This is the first Michael Crichton book I have ever read, but it is like the Jurassic Park movie: it keeps the action up all the time, especially after the first hundred pages.The science sounds good, and I guess history also is, judging the bibliography found at the end of the book. It is an adventure book mixed with sci-fi and history, and very entertaining.The explanation for time travel resembles the Sliders TV show or the Stephen Baxter the Timeships, but it never gets technical at all, and is one of my favorites. A really enjoyable book, which I think could be turned into a movie soon."
2,Crichton's really Great but.....,"I think Crichton just wanted to write off a long vacation in France....and this book was the result. Hmmmm, on second thought, I think he had a legitimate seed for a book (regarding the time travel stuff) but couldnt make a story with legs to go with it (Writer's Block)..then took an extended vacation in France to 'forget about writing for awhile'..Then he decided that it would be cool to write off (taxwise) the trip to France by slapping this story together with the Time Travel idea. It just seems like two different ideas 'not so conveniently' combined into one.His other stuff is great though!I just think he can do better than this one."
2,Not one of my favorites...,"Of all the Crichton books I have read, this one took me the longest to get through. I never found myself itching to pick this one back up...it got to the point where I was just pushing myself through it because I figured I'd give Crichton time to turn this one around. At the end, I was disappointed.Michael T. Hanley, CPA is the Managing Partner of the Smithtown, NY CPA Firm, Merl & Hanley, LLP and the author of Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness: 30 Minutes With...A Certified Public Accountant: Effective Tax Planning for the MicroBusiness"
5,An interesting page-turner,"This is a good page-turner, great for airport or beach reading. The novel brings medieval history, time travel and quantum physics to life. I had fun reading it but there is not much more that I'll remember for the long haul. It would make a good movie. (Maybe a movie has already been made of it).P.S. I meant to rate this a '3' but somehow I must have pressed '5' and I am unable to undo the mistake."
3,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. The historians getting sent back to the time and area that was the basis of their research was intriguing. However the plot in Castlegard was cliche due to the fact that the main characters always find some way out of every trap they are in. But then again, that is a typical action flick. Overall it was worth the read but not one of the best books I have read."
2,In a word- boring,"The science in Timeline is fairly interesting, but the book ultimately drags on waaaay too long. The action scenes get pretty redundant,and the characters never really came alive for me. I haven't really liked a Crichton book since Disclosure...Airframe was just okay, and I actually gave up on the Lost World after 100 or so pages. I really hope Crichton's next book is much better."
2,"Good Idea, Good Start, Disappointing Follow-through","I don't read Crichton, but I got this book as a gift. The beginning got me all excited-- this is a really cleaver idea! The first 75 pages were very mysterious and you wondered where the author was going to take this. But the book regresses quickly into a series of chase scenes with causal beheadings at every turn. There are serious plot holes (why not go back to 10 seconds before the professor arrives to keep him from getting lost? If they are traveling to a different dimension and not a different time, how does Marek end back in this dimension?) And the one open-ended mystery of the book (who else has an earpiece? de Kere? Guy?) is resolved in a couple of throwaway paragraphs. Maybe this is how Crichton writes (eye candy for the computer game generation), but I think he dropped the ball on this one."
2,The Pot Never Boiled,"Feh. Mike writes, what, a ""book"" in seven days. This ""book"" [read filmscript treatment] is thin stuff. Skin back the plot and here's the summary. Chapter Oneish: Look there's a rock, a puddle, a hole, a river, a bad guy. Rest of book: Have characters fall into hole, get out of hole, fall into puddle, get out of puddle, fall into river, get out of river, fight with bad guy, kill bad guy Well, you get it. No character development to speak of, and really quite little interesting interaction with historical setting. The historical characters and their relationships with each other are not developed at all. Much of character's actions are left unexplained, and there's a very obvious editorial gaff when Kate escapes to a ""narrower"" ceiling beam that is actually twice as wide. Very sloppy, very quickly put together stuff. Maybe good for a dumb Hollywood flick, but for a book, this is gossamer thin stuff indeed."
2,Old Wine in A New Skin,This scenario was painted by L. Sprague DeCamp and Fletcher Pratt in the Incomplete Enchanter and Castles of Iron years ago. Not an original idea or setting. Only the quantum time machine is new. I thought the book was tedious.
4,If you like Michael Crichton you'll like this book.,The title of this review pretty much sums it up. It doesn't matter if you're a history buff. It's fiction!!! You're supposed to lose yourself in the book and use your imagination. YES!! There are some of us left that have an imagination. I liked the book just as I like almost all of Crichton's books.
1,What happened??,"There's something wrong about this book - it starts out pretty good, with developing characters, their backgrounds, and weaving together a potentially interesting story. Somewhere along the line it all gets lost - wooden characters with no personality or background take over, the action is repetitive and boring, the writing becomes amateurish and rushed. Events from the beginning that clearly were meant to foreshadow later events never really pan out (So how did the old man end up in the desert after all and not back at the lab? Why did he introduce the cop and the doctor, give them backgrounds and make them nosy, and then never mention them again?) Its almost like he got halfway through and was forced the finish the book as fast as possible. I've enjoyed almost all his other books, but this one is strangely not well written in comparison."
5,really enjoyable,"Though this book was not amazing compared to his previous works, it is still a pretty amazing novel. I have to give Crichton credit for making subjects as difficult as quantum physics understandable. It also gives readers a chance to learn about medieval life without using boring textbooks.I think this book is definitely worth reading."
2,"Am I stupid or is this ""Weird Science?""","For example:1.What is the rush to repair the equipment? Can rescuers not teleport back to arrival day whenever they're ready? 2.How come they can figure out quantum teleportation, but cannot construct an ""answering machine"" or strengthen a glass panel without help? 3.Why can't they take guns back, but take miniature electronics in their ear? 4.Instead of pitching to investors, why doesn't Doniger go back in time a decade and buy microsoft?As science fiction this screenplay is worthless. As a remake of ""Conneticut Yankee"" it is fair. I expected more from the author of ""Andromeda Strain,"" ""Terminal Man"" and ""Jurassic Park."""
1,Boring,"To be fair, I have to admit that I gave up after 100 pages. The characters are absolutely cardboard, the story is reads like an outline for a story (put some flesh on it and it might work). In fact, perhaps that's what it is? The outline for a screenplay?"
3,Should we just call it a 'screenplay'?,I did enjoy the book (I'm glad others had a bit of difficulty with the physics also) but I almost could see it being written to be easily transformed into a movie. The characters did not have a lot of depth to them and you can figure out what the outcome will be. The historical information was wonderful and has gotten me to look for other books set in this time.
1,Very disappointing,"Starts off intriguingly mysteriously -- discovery of a strange body in a desert. But then deteroriates into fanciful non-credibility, shallow cardboard characters and an unconvincing plot. The book does not grab you, quite the contrary. It turned into a page-turner for me: to get through it quickly. I'm glad I bought it as an Xmas gift for someone who asked for it. I would regret having spent the money had I bought it for myself. The book will translate into a Hollywood special effects flash-zing-bangfest, though. -- Tom Longo in Ocean City, MD"
1,Bring Back the Dinosaurs,"I have really enjoyed all his other books, without exception, until this one...every author is entitled to write an occasional dud, and I'm afraid Crichton has done it here. Cardboard boring characters, obvious plot, silly science...ingredients similar to past books but for some reason the cake doesn't rise for this one."
2,"lame story, lame characters","As a former Yale graduate student, at least I had something in common with the (overly numerous) characters, but they still didn't hold my attention. The story was pretty pointless, and by the end I didn't care what happened. Skip it unless you're desperate for shallow entertainment. He does get extra points for ridiculing Yale's imitation gothic architecture."
3,"Typical Crichton, but ok","I enjoyed reading Timeline, although I thought it was typical Crichton. It seemed to fall a little flat after Jurasic Park. However, some of that feeling could be that I read it on audio cassette, and an abridged copy at that. It was exciting enough to keep me to the end, and I do recommend it to Crichton fans and to those who like adventure, fantasy or time-travel novels."
3,"Standard fare for Crichton. Interesting, but predictable.","What Crichton appears to have done with this book is simple. He took JURASSIC PARK, changed the characters, and altered the science discussed from genetic engineering to quantum mechanics. Overall, a predictable book, but interesting nonetheless.The main dissapointment the book presented was that the characters of Chris, Kate, and Andre were hardly given enough time to develop fully. They were immediately thrust into Crichtonian situation after Crichtonian situation, until the end of the book eventually arrived.Overall, an entertaining read, but don't expect a rich, compelling plot. If that's what you want, purchase THE LORD OF THE RINGS by J.R.R. Tolkien."
4,A real page turner.,"I cannot understand why people get worked up over the fact that the author may not fully understand quantum mechanics. So what, its a novel a story for goodness sake! Isn't he entitled to a little artistic licsense. I found this book a real page turner and was gripped from start to finish. Can't wait for the movie!"
4,Nice mix of quasi facts and fiction,"Very slow at the start, but after the first 100 pages it picks right up."
5,"Great Book, Great Writer","I think Crichton did a good job on this book, just like he has with all of his books. The book has a great mixture of true-to-life science, and medieval times. I personally like the book because of this and the fact that Crichton studies up on subjects before he writes about them to make the reading experience better. I like the book =)."
3,Strong out of the gate,"As you may have gathered from other reviews, the book comes on strong right away. I found myself fascinated by the science behind the story (as I did with Jurrasic Park). This lasted about 1/3rd the way through the book. The ""nick of time"" plot will surely make the book more ""movie ready,"" but is totally unnecessary for the story itself.The characters were quirky, but not terribly unrealistic. I found their relentless luck a little unnerving, the type of luck that you see in a Jackie Chan movie!This book is still a great read, don't get me wrong - it starts out FANTASTIC and then just dwindles down to above average... worth picking up if you like the writing style."
4,Nicely done!,"The book starts out when a couple finds a crazy old man in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico. The climax of the novel is in 14th century France. How? you wonder. So did I. The first 1/3 of the book keeps you turning the page in curiousity, the middle 1/3 keeps you turning the page out of ""I want to see what happens, but there's some slack and boringness in the plot"". The last 1/3 however, which begins in the action scene in the mill, keeps you turning the page due to fast paced adventure, and the book even has a twist in the end. All in all it's a worthy read for any Crichton reader, and it sure beats Lost World and Terminal Man in my opinion."
4,This book rules,"This book is exiting and keeps you wanting to read more. The only problem is on the scientific aspect of the book, Chriton goes a little to far, and sometimes in explaining theorys, the book is actually boring. It would be great to see this book turn into a movie but I hope chriton doesnt ruin this by making a sequel"
3,"TYPICAL CRICHTON - GREAT POSSIBILITIES-GREAT IDEA, BUT...","MICHAEL CRICHTON has great ideas....His story lines continue to be original, exciting and certainly different.....I don't love his writing style....This story started off slowly, picked up and then went off a little too much.....although I loved the ending....A good quck read...."
2,Not well written.,"I believe Crichton suffers from his own success. This book reads like it was put to print when it became ""good enough"". The foreshadowing is blatant, the plot mechanisms are cliche. He even makes a huge obvious mistake - the characters are using earpieces to communicate, which also translate language into common-era English on the fly; the thing is, for a good portion of the second half of the book, the characters have turned off all their earpieces, but can STILL understand what the locals are saying, when just 12 hours ago, they could understand nothing without the earpieces! There are other smaller time inconsistancies. This is just sloppy, and I think a lot of popular authors let their quality drop like this when they're pumping out a book or more a year.Despite all of this, the book was still enjoyable, and that's what saved its rating. Crichton at least understands reader attention span and interest."
2,Doomsday Book ripoff,"One wouldn't think that there would be a limit to where one could go in the imagination when it comes to travel. However, Michael Crichton seems to have completely copied the ideas of Connie Willis in her far better rendition of this story, Doomsday Book.I highly recommend her version (the paperback came out in 1993) over Crichton's."
4,Crichton did his research,"Though the book had a slower start (in my opinion), it was constantly building up and getting better, layer after layer of the story. Crichton did his research about the 1400s and it is very informative and well-written. As an action lover and one who appreciates history, I give this book a solid four out of five."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Maybe I'm a sucker for time travel books but I couldn't put this one down. Sure, Crichton telegraphs every move and the characters continue to escape from seemingly hopeless situations but for pleasure reading...I wish it were twice as long. I didn't buy the book to learn about quantum physics but rather to get my mind off work and into a more creative frame. Crighton did a good job at this with his description of life in the late middle ages. He also set the tone so we didn't obsess over the ""smashed butterfly changing the future we live in"" scenario. Not the best, but darn entertaining!"
2,Timeline=The Goonies,"As I got further and further into this book, all I could think of was Spielberg's schlocky movie, The Goonies. The entire last half of the book is one ridiculous and unbelievable action sequence after another. Crichton had such a rich subject to work with here; it could've been so much better than next year's cheesy summer action movie. Next time, write the novel before the screenplay, okay?"
4,Couldn't put it down!,"This book was very engaging...I couldn't wait to finish. I started it one night and finished the next afternoon. Great combination historical fiction/adventure story, with some science fiction thrown in for good measure. To those who say the quantum physics aren't accurate, it's not a textbook, it's FICTION. Enjoy the story!"
5,Chrichton did it again.,"With a different plot like always, he came with more new ideas. People love his ideas. The book opened in 21'st century. I loved the way Chrichton describes each and every detail. I have read all of his books except ""A case of need."" I could not wait for this book to come to the library. I reserved this book online so that I could get it on time. Great way to go."
3,"Been there, done that kind of book","H.G. Wells meets Barbara Cartland meets J.R.R. Tolkien. The only thing new about this book was the quantum physics stuff. I hate to admit that I have read one too many romance novels in my time. And, this book is just a scientific romance novel. There are some very intense chapters. But, I also got to the point where I said, ""Just how many times can these people escape unscathed?"" There were far too many. Save for a beach book. It is a mindless read and not worth a lot of extra effort."
2,Tedious and uneventful,I was initially captured by the premise and was excited to see M.C. merge and weave science and fiction. The book got off to a promising start and then it just dragged on. Unfortunately he wrote a screenplay and I had expected to read a novel.
2,Definitely Bubblegum For the Mind,"A read for traveling or the beach...when it isn't important to follow exactly what is happening. The premise for the novel is good, interesting, and maybe even plausible. However, characters and even subplots were not developed as fully nor as interestingly as they could have been. Read and think, for example, about the opening scenes in the desert and the hospital...the ""map,"" on the old man, the good and eager young cop, the earnest and hard-working native-American female doctor, their romantic interest. All pop up somewhat later, but never really take a part in the plot other than to take up printed space. Too much written, too quickly and as others have pointed out, this novel will probably make a good movie. I rented a library copy rather than waste my money!"
3,Typical Crichton,"I love Michael Crichton. I hang out for each new release, diappointed when I don't get my fix.I like books that mix facts with fiction. One that teaches me something, and fools me into believing that it just could happen.This is typical Crichton, so it didn't disappoint me at all. You could see the plan to make it into a box office movie, but it didn't stoop as low as Lost World, which tried far too hard to attract a young audience. He has obviously done his research, and I had that sense of learning as I turned the pages. As usual he made each page one to keep you turning.Not a stunning novel as far as plot, but if you like Crichton's other work, you will enjoy this."
2,"All Science, No Substance","This was the first book I ever read by Micheal Crichton and I was very disappointed. After hearing such rave reviews about him from friends and the media, I picked up this book, a time-travel (or rather people-traveling, because ""time doesn't travel, people travel"") book that taught me more about quantum physics than I ever wanted to know. The first hundred pages of this book are an Ok introduction to what I expected to be a good book, but Crichton spend the next hundred pages explaining quantum physics in ""simple"" terms. If that wasn't boring enough, I never felt like I knew any of the characters beyond their stereotypes of strong man, prep student, and tomboy. I'm sorry I even bothered to finish this book. It was a tremendous waste of time. Perhaps other books by Crichton are better, but I'm not about to try to read them."
2,"Good beginning, sliding fast.","Charles Pike's review has it right: ""Timeline"" starts out well, but after catching the reader's interest, it takes some seriously wrong turns. Once the scientists have moved into the medieval past, the book becomes a kind of all-text video game in which they must confront one crisis after another, in a tedious and predictable series of battles. I felt that I was trudging to the end, determined to finish though it was a waste of time. (I just wondered if Crichton might have created a video game first and then written the book.)"
1,Waste of time and money,The time machine based on quantum mechanic is just about what's interesting in this book. This was only book I threw away without finishing in recent years.
1,Are you serious?,"Hey, I can suspend my belief enough for time travel, but not enough for what the main characters acheive in this book. Battle hardened Knights, deadly accurate archers, mideival prisons, these are no match for these college students who suddenly turn superhuman and slice, dice and defeat everyone they encounter while escaping more impossible situations than I can count. This book was highly recommended to me by three people. Great plot, well written, I just couldn't get past the absurdity of it."
1,show me the money,"I have enjoyed many of his previous books. This one has a compelling plot, time-travel, quantum mechanics, 13th century France. But Crichton delivers only the bare bones of a novel, it is more a screen-play for an action-adventure flick starring Leonardo. Very unsatisying."
1,Shame on you - Michael!,"You've got the research down well; the plot is transparent, the people hollow, the coincidences unworthy of you! I wanted and deserved better! You wrote a Hollywood script; no need to think -- the twists and turns are all too predictable. Good read for JFK/LHR trip -- then leave on the 747!"
4,Couldn't put it down,"This book might as well have been glued to my hands from beginning to end. Great plot, never a dull moment. Very good ending too... Only weakness was in presenting some of the characters. I would have liked to hear more about Lady Claire, during the story. Unfortunately, she became neglected right about the time I developed an interest in her character.And the timetravel premise was not an issue at all. In fact I thought it was very well presented, considering the book is ""fiction"", after all."
2,Pandering to the Movie Makers,"I have liked some of Mr. Crichton's books. When he writes a book, he is very good. When he writes a screenplay, he is not. Some of his books are obviously written so that they can be turned into movies. This is one of them, which is why the plot is predictable, the characters stereotyped, and the action so unending. Don't get me wrong, I like action, but it seemed that it was being added just to keep the book going, and to satisfy possible movie makers and not because it was needed in the story. OK...parts of this were good, like when he described the way people and things were in the Middle Ages. However, that wonder went away when the book descended into a screenplay. Get this book from a library if you must, but spend your money elsewhere."
4,A journey woth the time,"This book provided me with a lot of knowledge. It is rich of scientific information that is very complicated but yet presented in a simple manner. The characters were very rich and persuasive. The suspense make it almost impossible to put this book down. Each page is filled with another adventure, another obstacle to over come, another battle to win. The author seems to have spent a lot of time researching and as a result the book seems to be an everflowing source of information. The intriguing settings keep the reader attached to the book. The storylines keep you guessing what is going to happen next and to whom. You can't resist but to put yourself in the position of the characters. All in all I feel as if i had walked away knowing a lot more than I did when i first started reading this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure and likes asking themselves ""what if?"""
2,follow the rules!,"Crichton violates the fundamental rule of time travel. His characters take action in the past with no mention of how their actions might change the future. For me, this blaring fault outweighed anything that might have been good about this book."
2,"Nice Concept, Disappointing Plot",This book had a great idea and then failed completely to follow through on it. There was so much more that Crichton could have explored! What really bother me was the totally mechanical structure to each chapter. Each one ended with a crisis for one or two of the characters which the others then had to rescue them from in the next chapter. This was repeated so many times it was laughable. The book seemed to be written on autopilot.
3,A Printed Movie,"Lightly entertaining with a few good twists but, unlike a work by Michner, a book that is easy to break away from between sessions. I expected the author to do more with the multiverse principles on which the plot is based. TIMELINE reflects a formula storyline that lacks nothing one expects--boy likes girl who likes him only as a friend, events constructed to try to make the reader believe that the main characters are forever trapped in their situation, predictable solutions and outcomes to predicaments roller-coasted throughout the novel and hackneyed dialogue. I got the sense that movie contracts were in place as the story was being written. The book reminded me of why I seldom read novels and never cared to write one."
2,Really dislike the reader for the audio book,"I'm having a hard time telling if I like this novel or not because the reader for the audio book is so annoyingly bad. He uses a perpetually whiny tone for every scene and character and his accents for characters are just odd. I dislike it so much I decided to come here to write a review on it. And by looking up the reader's name, I'll be sure to never get another audio book by him."
3,good but kinda drags in places,This is not the strongest Crighton book. It drags in places as we count down the the escape time the trvelrs have to get back to modern time. It was a sluggish read.
1,His worst novel ever.,I have read and liked almost all of Crichton's novels but this one is just horrible. I couldn't believe how boring this thing was. Avoid at all costs.
1,Don't waste your time...,"Yet again, Crichton lets the science overshadow little things like plot, character development, and so forth. Mike, a word to the wise. If I wanted to read a book on theoretical quantum physics, I would buy a book on theoretical quantum physics. If I wanted to read a book on medieval history, I would buy a book on medieval history. When I read a fiction piece, I want to read about well-developed characters in a well-paced plot delivering believable dialogue. Three things this ""novel"" was completely lacking in."
1,Very disappointing,"It begins well but develops into a dumbed-down Jurassic Park loaded with inconsistencies and every action/adventure cliche possible. Did Crichton really write this? This book, after its promising opening, reveals no more original thought than the worst B-movie you've ever seen. The only redeeming quality is the (I imagine) accurate description of medieval villages and castles. Most of Crichton's characters, if you can call them that, are barely one-dimensional, especially the medieval folk, who are all ugly, stinking, bloodthirsty knights, with the exception of one enigmatic and indecisive lady who suffers from multiple personality disoder. It's a quick read, but quicker if you skip it. Or whatever."
2,TimeLine,"This book reads more like a screen play then a novel. The characters are shallow and under developed. Our heroes are constantly put into dire situations only to be saved at the last moment by some fantastic turn of events. The characters from the past are stereotypical Hollywood types, either slobbering oafs or twisted mad men. I personally think the movie will be better then the book in this case.Paul"
2,Bayeaux Tapestry it's not!,"Michael Crichton would have been better served if he had sent his time travelers back in time to interview more capable authors, in the hope that they might bring back some tips that might add a second and third dimension to his writing. This book is cartoonish at best. Reading this book is like watching Vic Morrow in TV's Combat. We know who is going to get whacked by book's end - just as soon as we meet all the characters. How these fish-out-of-water characters survived their adventure is explainable only by the fact that the big stars who play them in the movie have to stick around long enough to justify their paychecks. Is there any cliche not touched on in this writing-by-the-numbers exercise? Crichton phoned this one in. Let's see... if I replace the dinosaurs with knights, and I replace the island with a castle.... Ka-ching goes the cash register!"
2,Writing by the numbers,"I love a good time-travel yarn, but this one seems pretty formulaic. Once you get through the cursory but interesting discussion of quantum technology, you're left with a fairly mundane adventure yarn that's full of action but desperately thin on character.I guess the thing that's most disappointing about ""Timeline"" is that it never really gets beyond the stereotypes we all have of medieval times - it's all swordplay and jousting and castle intrigue. I would have enjoyed a little more insight into the time itself. Surely not everyone in the Middle Ages was brandishing a broadsword every second. Surely there are some interesting contrasts and parallels between that time and this one.""Timeline"" reads like a screenplay, and I suppose that's what it really is: opening next summer in a theater near you. Tarted up with special effects, the movie might actually be more interesting than the book. But I think I'll pass anyway."
1,"Expected more, much more",I really expected this book to be to physics what Jurassic Park was to genetics.... and it failed badly. It is just a medieval story with some 21st century insight. It was almost a waste of time.
1,Puh-Leeeeaaasseeee....,"Honestly, Crichton must think that the great mass of people are incredibly naive. Hmmm... lets see... I don't want to come up with an REAL orginal plot, so I'll just write another book about a mad genius making a theme park. I already wrote 2, but no one will notice a 3rd I guess...Jurassic Park was an interesting conecpt, The Lost World was terrible, and Timeline is yet another where the author is obviously more interested in movie deals than a well-written, well-rounded book with an ACTUAL ORIGINAL PLOT!Please Mr. Crichton, retire this tired, ""I-must-corner-the-world-vacation-market"" storyline. What's next, ""I will create a historically accurate amusement park, with dinosaurs, on the moon?""... You could call it ""The Historically Accurate, Jurassic Moon Park"". The follow up (for movie purposes only of course) could be ""The Lost Moon Park""... Puh-leeeaaasse....."
1,Made for Movies plot,"Michael Crichton has given us readers cause for excitement whenever his latest novel appears - they tend to be well worth the wait.'Timeline' then, must be the exception to the rule. It's really a movie script disguised as a novel. The pace, the detail, the characters, the plot all seem to have come straight from a big-budget Hollywood movie rather than from a book from one of the more gifted and imaginative writers of our times."
3,Movie script,"Predictable is the word. Character development is totally lacking. I did get into the story midway and found I could not put it down until a rather, here's that word again, predictable, ending. The research is great but there are holes. I also found myself having to re-read sections because a significant event was buried under some techincal jumble. Someone reviewed the book as ""intellectual""....compared to what? I teach history and found little use despite the research."
2,A Movie,This is one time where the movie will likely be better than the book...a real Indiana Jones type story
2,Cliche City,"Fairly entertaining, but I got the distinct impression that Crichton gathered every science fiction, action/adventure, and medieval cliche he could find and crammed them into this book. Main characters are shallow, intriguing characters (the Gallup cop, for one) are dropped. After awhile, I greeted every new twist with ""Oh, please -- like we haven't seen that one a few hundred times."" For someone who purports to want to set the record straight about the middle ages, Crichton seems to me to pretty much follow the images established by old Hollywood. And his explanations about time and inter-universe travel conflict each other all over the place. You know, I really liked ""Coma""."
1,I'm with Haschka,"Joe Haschka's review hit the nail on the head. Disjointed and pompous, and the characters are utter cyphers. Blathering dreck with an incredibly disappointing ending. What happens to Andre? We'll never know. And ""the Professor""? The one on Gilligan's island had more personality. Dreadful."
3,A truly average book.,"No doubt, the author thoroughly researched the 1300's and quantum physics. He does a fine job of displaying his knowledge. However, the book lacks any real depth. We never really get to know the characters. The action scenes lack any umph! The book reads like a movie. For once, I think the movie will be better than the book. And you know there's movie around the corner."
3,Timeline Falls Short,"Having read every of Crichton's works of fiction, this book ranks among the lowest of his books (aside from Lost World and Sphere.) Crichton lays the groundwork for a potential exciting story but ends up with a far-fetched and too busy of a story. Without giving away the ending, Crichton fails to deliver that jaw dropping finale and you can see how the book will get wrapped up long before reaching page 400. I will continue to buy Crichton (except any dinosaur-related stories) and believe that he is simply in a slump and will put out another good one like Disclosure in the years to come."
3,"not the worst, but not the best either.","if he had not written 'Jurassic Park', 'Timeline' would have been his best book. unfortunately, it isn't.would it be my fault if i expected a 'techno-thriller' like JP? 'Timeline' seems more like a historical novel.if i had known that this book has more pages about medieval ages, i wouldn't pick it up easily. i'm a fan of Mike cause of JP and 'Travels', so this book isn't my taste."
3,A Mishap Adventure in Time,"Here we go with Mr. Crichton Lording it over us how intelligent he is. This novel is good , but this is a case of less is more. I really enjoy the medieval period and the storyline involving a professor and several graduate students going back in time to the 14th century was done very well. The problem comes with getting bogged down in the tiresome banalities of quantum physics. Once you get past that it is a good read."
2,Crichton's worst book....ever!,"Oh man, what a great premise for a slam bang story! So where does thisthing go wrong?Better yet, where does this book not go wrong? Timeline is a ramblingincoherent mess, the plot screams of outrageous contrivances, tangentialunresolved subplots, and some pretty lame Flash Gordonesque cliffhangersI've seen this side of Who Shot JR!Hard to believe Crichton lent his name to this drivel. You've been warned."
4,Imagine Yourself in Fourteenth Century France,"If you like a book that has history and physics combined then you should read the novel by Micheal Crichton ""Timeline"". It's about four archaelogists who go back in time to Castlegard, France in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Year War. Their mission is to rescue Professor Johnston within 36 hours. Once they find the professor, the archaelogists must rely on their knowledge of history, and their instincts, to survive and return to the twentieth century. This is made possible by scientists working at ITC who use the quantum theory to connect wormholes,allowing people to travel to other universes existing at an earlier time.The characters in ""Timeline"" find that life in the fourteenth century is not always what they had expected. This book gives an interesting view of France during the Hundred Years War.I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and science or anyone who just loves an adventure. You won't want to put this book down."
5,Time machine revisited,"This rapid little read is reminiscent of H.G.Well's TIME MACHINE, only with a ""French twist."" The futuristic quantum technology tracks backward, straight into European history, and that's when the fun really begins.There are knights in shining armor, good guys, and bad guys. The action is unstoppable and relentless. I recommend this book most earnestly. It is just a helluva lot of fun!!! Treat yourself...."
4,"fascinating, but JP has it beat","Many people love Michael Crichton books. I do. When you are looking for a guy who gives you all the information, he is the one to read. He gets in depth about the Quantum computer and makes it interesting, but it takes effort to understand. Even then, the book itself is good overall. I highly reccomend it to people interested in mideval times. The novel is very discriptive in a sense that he researches every aspect of it. i still say JP has it beat."
4,Good read,"For the most part this was a good read, kept you really involved. I found myself up late (when I should have been sleeping ) to see what happens next. typical of a M.C. novel. There were some cheesie schwarzenegger or 007 situations where the characters keep escaping impossible scenarios. entertaining just the same."
2,Fun to read,"In praise of Crichton's new book, I can say that it was fun to read, but not much else. It's very obvious from the writing that he did quite a bit of research into the Middle Ages, but there's very little that would be new information to anyone who's taken any European history course. The quantum theory he uses to justify what is essentially a form of time travel is based in fact, but fantastic descriptions littered with meaningless jargon place the process well outside the boundary of reality. The plot devices he uses are old and threadbare, and the characters are stereotypical to an absurd degree. He did keep the plot moving, however, and taken as nothing more than a typical action book, it was a decent read."
2,another disappointment from Crichton,"It is surprising to me that I can enjoy greatly most of Crichton's books but this Timeline seemed silly, I couldn't wait to finish it. Nearly as bad as Airframe."
2,I'm glad I was given this book as a gift...,"...because I'd be embarrassed to have paid for it. ""Timeline"" will make a wonderfully entertaining and forgettable movie. As historical fiction I found it intriguing - except... if you read carefully you find that critical elements (the furnishings of the castles, the size & strength of the knights) are *speculation* i.e. fictional not historical. As science fiction, it's pathetic - does anybody remember ""Time Tunnel"" the TV show? This is at that same level of sophistication: Super-duper computer, cavernous rooms with drifting vapor, showers of sparks, paper-thin characters molded to fit the story. The science is Hollywood science - it enables the story, but only if you don't think about it for more than a few milliseconds. If you stop reading and *think* for a few seconds, it falls apart like wet carboard."
3,Scooby Doo in Hyperspace,"If you like Scooby Doo, you'll love this book. Four young people in completely sterile relationships who act without thinking, performing amazing physical feats as they run from menacing forces. They have to get back to their world with ""the professor"" before it's too late (or their batteries run down!???). Give it three stars for the imaginative descriptions of 14th century castle life, and 21st century physics. Watch for the film; should be lots of blood and explosions."
1,Terribly written,"Maybe this book will work as a movie script or story board for a game. It doesn't work as a book. It's BORING, full of stupid cliches and insipid characters, not hisotrically or scientifically accurate, and a real waste of time. It's not a movie I will go to (too bloody), but I'm sure it will do well at the box office. It does not deserve to do well as a book, though."
3,"Nice film script, shame about the novel!","I have to say, having just finished this book, that I was a little disappointed. Although the story was good I always had the notion that I was reading a future Steven Spielberg film script! Following on from this thought, the characters became predictable and this had a further effect on my enjoyment of the read as I became aware of the outcome someway before the finish. Shame, the title of the book and the opening paragraph promised more than it delivered!"
5,A good book,This was my first Crichton and I was totally impressed. I was really exciting and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved how Crichton included the quantum theory of traveling through the multiverse in this book and how a group of historians could go to another universe to rescue a fellow historian from another time. This is an excellent book!
3,Disappointing,"Not one of his better books, by far. Slow paced and a lot of characters who have no real meaning to the plot."
2,Timeline = False Suspense,"Crichton has sunk to the level of B-Grade movies. It seems to plague many highly successful writers. They invent a ridiculous, unbelievable situation to put their protagonists in a dangerous situation. In Timeline, for example, he has two highly intelligent people floating down a dark underground river in a boat while holding a lit torch. Can you believe that neither person was watching their route ahead? Neither can I, but Crichton has some stalagtites appear that knock the person holding the torch into the river! This is only one of many examples in the book of how not to write suspense into fiction. It was a 23-hour day of traveling, so I did suffer through to a reasonably good ending."
4,World Class Narration,"The unabridged audio tapes have the best narration of a full-length novel that I have ever heard. The range of characterization is compelling, entertaining and convincing. You can't beat this cassette edition for commuting to work-- it will make you look forward to the drive!"
3,Typical Crichton,"This is the sixth Crichton I've read and I can usually write the same review for every one. His storyline ideas are incredible. Very believable science fiction ideas which translate over to movies well. His character development however is his weak point. I found this to be true in Timeline as well. This story was not his best either, leaving you wondering what the purpose of all this was by the time you are finished. A fairly quick reading book and not all bad, but I can't give it a rousing endorsement either."
2,Timeline,"This book reads like a script for a motion picture, with its last minute escape. The look inside 15th Century France was interesting, but the science behind it was difficult to understand and hard to believe. I have enjoyed most of Michael Crichton's books, but this seemed to be written with the big buck payout in mind and not the enjoyment of the reader."
3,ceci n'est pas un livre de Boulez,"Cette livre est un chose que je comprends comme un faux-ideologue ceci un grand horse a bout. Il n'y a pas de carrotes, mais pourquoi a Chrichton n'est-ce pas voulez les reassignements blu? Et pourquoi faire-il la premiere fois a gauche pour favour dans la salle a manger, exceptez pas de creme broulez pour savoir les Elians chaud? Apres de finir cette livre j'ais manager mes mains et telephonez tout ma famille pour vous a ca, ""Combien des angels que dancer sur la head d'un pin?"" Elles n'a savoir pas que de dit."
1,Timeless Plot or Just Time Without a Plot?,"Michael Critchon should just have included the shooting directions for the movie in this book and been done with it. The scientific premise of the story is interesting, but the book is populated with characters about whom it is impossible to get involved - his ""Bill Gates"" character is devoid of any human qualities whatsoever and the rest of the crew is so ""by the book"" they might just as well have been named ""Character One"" and ""Character Two"". Look for the movie to be out shortly and the action not too far behind."
4,Back to the future,"Stirring up memories of ""Jurassic Park"", Michael Crichton's latest novel plunges us into the heart of medieval France and.....quantum physics. He uses the same formula that he has dabbled with in the past(with great success)-that of combining history with science and delivering an engaging, to-be-read-in-one-sitting book. The book, like medieval France, is not flawless. It is, however, intriguing in its premise of time travel at a sub-atomic level. As usual, Crichton's prose is lean. He doesn't embellish his account with visually rich prose. One supposes that the film based on the book will lend the visual, visceral edge that underlies the book. Though there are parallels between Jurassic Park and Timeline, the books stand apart as imaginative accounts by a writer who likes to think and, in turn, makes the reader think of the immense possibilities that the future holds. With this book, Crichton has taken a step forward, by taking a step back."
4,IT's Good EXcept For.....,The Book Timeline is very good except for his explanation of the quatom technology. It is hard to understand the technology but will not ruin the book with that small problem. The other sections of the book of which take place in the past seem very written and researched on. The ending is also very good and you will not expect what happens except all that all the main characters survive.
2,Should Have Been in the Movie Section,"I have to sympathize with a few of the other reviewers on this one. I was excited to read Crichton's new book thinking that the plot line would be an exciting one. However, midway through I felt as though I was reading a screenplay and not a book. This has too often been the calling sign of the Crichton of late. Yes he can still dazzle us with his unbelievble descriptiveness of that which most people don't understand, but he too has become commercialized. I wish he would just go back to being a great writer, like the days of Andromeda Strain. Now that was a work of art."
3,"Not His Best, but a Valiant Effort","Well, I did enjoy the brief lectures of Quantum physics, however it seems he left too many holes to truly explain the plot. For example, if this is a ""split"" dimension of time, how could anything they do affect the future? Why the concern if what they did did not matter, considering it was not our time specifically they travelled back to? I agree with most of these reviews, the characters were stiff and simply basic. I have seen better development in ten page short stories. One of the book's somewhat few strong points, however, is the accuracy in depicting the past. This accuracy, unfortunately, is ruined over and over by the seemingly endless good fortune of the characters as they escape one disaster after another. I like a good suspense as much as anyone, but when you keep building suspense without consequence (when you just keep letting everyone get away scratch free) you're no longer writing a book, you're drawing a cartoon."
1,Creighton's error,"I've loved his books from Andromeda Strain on. This book, although beginning in a great Creighton fashion, quickly deterioriates into pure convoluted garbage of unlikely events that will challenge the credulity of even a third grade student. Anyone who cares enough about what will happen, to read on to the end, has my admiration."
3,"a good, but predictable yarn","The book was a good yarn. Unfortunately, it read a lot like a movie. This is good for frenetics, but it hinders character developement. There were places where it was hard to put the book down, but there were also stretches where I could guess the outcome of every page. The introduction was classic and very alluring. Unfortunately, it also created an expectation that wasn't met. The book wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. It was a decent, no-brainer action oriented read. It could've used some more physics and hard science. Finally, unless your a Crichton collector, get it at the library or buy the paperback."
3,"Good plot, cardboard characters","Timeline is well researched and has an exciting plot. However, the character development is almost non-existent. If you like a fun read and don't care about the characters, then this book is for you. If you're looking for something more, you'll be disappointed."
1,At best disappointing,"If you are a history fan and a medieval times fan, like I am, you will at least love the first half of this book. It's down hill from there. This book is like a bad movie in which the main characters keep getting themselves into bad situations and incredibly get out of them intact, and you can't stop thinking: ""When is this piece of poo going to end!?"". And just when you thought it could not get worse it does... again and again.This is by far the worst novel I have ever read, ever.Since I am a Michael Crichton fan it is very disappointing for me to have undergone from his writing such a horrible experience.Skip this book. It is definitely not worth the pain."
3,Good but not Awesome,"I REALLY liked the beginning part of the book and once it got into Crighton's theories of ""Time Travel"" I was thrilled at the realistic level of detail and accuracy that makes me wonder if this technology is at all possible!I thought that the mid-evil scenes were okay... I was hoping for more Time theories and less old-type action. A major problem was (I tend to skim, or read quickly so I need a book that constantly reminds me who characters are and whats going on) that i got lost a bunch of times and didn't know what was going on...<sigh>, very frustrating. I enjoyed the other Crighton book, Sphere much better.I WILL tell you this, though. I really admire all of his work and a glance at the sources cited page will show much research he puts into his books. I believed(and still do) all of his historical references and thought it was a nice touch.Good, but not great. Worth reading if you like historical stuff...I'm more of a sci-fi fan myself."
4,A Blend of History & Science,"A nice quick read for anyone who has a combined interest in science, history, and an energetic thriller."
2,DEFINITELY NOT !,"THis is definitely not the adventure masterpiece wsome people are saying it is ! It's a good Crichton novel, but a little below his own standards of quality. It's not boring at all, but is not so involving and ""impossible to stop reading"" as some people said. A good book to fulffill his editorial contracts."
1,Wasted time,Because none of us can jump through time I'll keep it very brief. This book was a total waste of time.
4,A Page Turner!,I read this book as an eBook on my PocketPC. It was great! I found the story compelling and evocative. I particularly appreciated the juxtaposition of technologies modern and ancient.
2,A Little Off Track,"I was excited to finally see a new book from Michael Crichton hit the shelves last Thanksgiving. I just got to it now, and unfortunatly, it wasn't what I was expecting. Yes there is the usual info, and the suspense, but something is missing from Timeline. It seems to follow the same formula of all action/suspense/thriller novels in which the good guys avoid every possible danger that would lead to their death, and the villians trip the wrong way and meet their demise. From Chris escaping death of ""skilled"" knights numerous times, to Kate flying off beams high atop a castle, it just isn't realistic. Although I must say that Andre Marek is one of the most interesting charcters I have met in a Crichton novel in a long time, which is saying a lot since character description is not his high point. A mixed review; not good, but not bad either."
2,disapointing,"This book was entertaining for awhile, the mixture of science and fiction was, as always with Crichton unique. However the characters were hardly developed and shallow as was the story. I felt like it was written for the sole purpose of being made into a movie. Overall it was a big disapointment."
2,Disappointing Timeline,"I agree with the other reviewers who thought the book had a good premise, but fell way short when trying to live up to the Crichton name. Descriptions of the knights, ruins, etc where terrific, the science behind time travel will fly with those who don't know a bit about science, and the ""here vs there"" plot got tiresome. For those who want to buy it, borrow it from a friend or take it out at the library."
2,"Too long, too shallow","Good concept, and a very interesting scientific angle, but reads like a drawn-out comic book. The plot was poorly developed, never straying from the pattern of getting into a jam, getting out, killing some medievals, repeat. There was just no depth.After reading half the book, I was very disappointed and only finished it in order to give this review some validity, while hoping in vain for some sort of plot twist. My poor wife heard me whine all the way through.I read Terminal Man, Andromeda Strain, Great Train Robbery and Jurassic Park and found them excellent. This book is definitely coasting on reputation or written as a movie script."
2,non-stop action and little else,"This book succeeds at what it tries to do. It keeps us turning pages and implicitly critiques Connie Willis's poorly executed THE DOOMSDAY BOOK. For my money, it ought to have tried to do at least a little more, though. Even the incessant action-adventure eventually becomes wearying.This is the first novel I've read that comes with a bibliography. I would have given it an extra star for this circumstance--it charmed and amused me--except that on this bibliography's recommendation I read the book from which TIMELINE took its (pseudo-scientific) explanation of time travel, THE FABRIC OF REALITY. Let's just say it ought to have occurred to me that a book that calls itself ""The Fabric of Reality"" is likely to be only loosely connected to it."
4,Not what I've expected at all...,"... from M. Crichton. I was a bit skeptical in the first few pages, testing the waters whether or not I should find something else to read, when I found myself reading faster and faster, trying to figure out what will happen next. Not exactly sci-fi, not really a full blown thriller, but an exciting book to read."
4,Come On!,All those bad reviews! What do you expect. This is not literary fiction. Take this book for what it is - very good escapism. Enjoy the story as you will enjoy the upcoming movie.
2,Disappointing,"I only finished this book because I've enjoyed the author's previous novels so much. This treatment of time travel had some clever technological explanations, but when you've said that, you've said it all. The characterization was poor and the plot plodded on with very little excitement. At the end of the day, I didn't care whether they ever got back or not. The ending was not satisfactory either...I hope there's no sequel coming!"
2,Horrid,"As with some of Crichton's other novels, this one is bearable if you turn off your brain and just visualize the action. The quantum theories presented are very young and for the most part, disregarded my most physicist. The most discouraging thing about the story is the gigantic holes! It is painfully obvious that Chrichton was hoping that readers would not catch-on to how short the novel would have been if it was constructed with any logic."
2,Made for the big screen,This is yet another screenplay in hardcover. I liked his earlier work but it's getting hard to make it through his latest efforts. I think the major issue here is the lack of any character development compared to what MC has demonstrated in the past.
2,A movie!,"As a huge Michael Crichton fan this is the first book that was a disappointment. The beginning was good. The technical information and research was interesting as always in Crichtons books. The middle held my attention until the ongoing similar type of fighting and chasing got to be tedious. Enough was enough. By the time I got to the end I struggled not to skip ahead. The biggest disapppointment was that this book was definitely written to be a movie. I noticed this from very close to the beginning. I kept seeing the Indiana Jones movie in my head as I read this book. As a faithful reader I look forward to Crichtons next book but would like to see him get back in touch with his readers. In the future, rather than writing a script for a movie I will hope he writes an authentic novel as were his novels in the past."
3,A Fun Read,"After months of tedious work, and mind numbing report writing, I wanted to find a book to just kick back with, and found just the thing in ""Timeline"". It wasn't difficult to follow, was at times creative, and was basically fun to read. It made for a pleasant two day vacation from the present world."
3,Ultimately Disatisfying,"I also, like other readers, became engrossed in the book, and had a hard time putting it down, but I must agree with others who complain that the book, which started so well, ended so badly. One reviewer called it ""cartoonish,"" and I must agree. An interesting idea, but it turned into something a good deal less."
3,Not typical Crichton,"Although an enjoyable read, this is not Crichton's best by far. Usually when one reads a Crichton book, you expect a compelling mystery laden with technology. You do not get that in this book. This book feels more like it was made to be a movie. The techonolgy of time travel never really enters the story. Yes it is there, but he never gets into the nitty-gritty as he does in Andromeda Strain, Jurrasic Park, AirFrame, and Congo. That was missed by me. The other issue that I had with the book is that a lot of the characters seem to be ripped right out of Jurrasic Park. Overall, this book did not feel wholly original, as do most of Crichton's book. If you want to read a book about time travel to the 14th century, read Doomsday Book by Connie Willis."
1,"Good action, terrible premise","This book has Crichton's trademark action. But the premise makes no sense, and if it did, the real issues raised are not pursued at all in the book. His notions of time travel use a lot of quantum bable, but have no credibility in science. If they did, nobody would want to participate in time travel as he imagines it."
3,"Good story, but with some problems","I basically enjoyed this story. Read all the other reviews for the plot. In this review I want to point out what I believe are some irritating things in this book1. Why is everybody out to kill the time travelers? From the first moment they set foot in the past, it seems like the sole purpose of everyone in that time is to kill them.2. The CEO was not really a villian, just amoral. Yet at the end he receives an incredibly brutal punishment for his actions by the supposedly good guys. And his actions weren't all that bad.3. The business plan laid out for the company controlling the quantum time travel is a joke! They could never recover the billions invested and re-construction costs of historical sites from tourism.It's these kinds of things that keep me from giving 5 stars to this book. Still, it is a good story and I am glad I bought this book."
4,Future and Past,"For starters this book, which was written by the acclaimed author Michael Crichton, has more references than some non-fiction books I have read. This helps to give this book an in depth body that realy brings you in to the time period. The book is so fast paced and full of suspense that it keeps you wondering what is going to happen with every turn of the page. This was my first read of a Crichton book and I would have to say that I was very impressed by how much information was actually contained in the book. If you want to read a good book and learn a little about fourteenth-Century France this is the one for you."
1,Peeling already............,"I bought this pan in December and liked it for a while and then I discovered the nonstick was aready peeling!! I have followed the directions on how to use it to a tee and this still happened. I cook on lower heat, hand wash only, use only nonstick friendly utensils and still only after 2 months of using the pan it is peeling. I will be contacting Calphalon."
2,Not as advertised...,"While Amazon advertises this version of Common Worship: Daily Prayer as leather bound, it is not. It is a leather embossed paper over a flexible cover.The prayer book itself is wonderful. I was hoping to replace one that I'd ruined with spilled water but will be returning this version to the seller."
4,Fun x 7,"This video is like their album: fun. The video contains about 16 minutes of behind the scenes on their show and three episodes of about 20 minutes each. The group has been sent to a Miami hotel to perform by their bad manager. Along with singing, the 7 must put up with the crusty hotel manager and his silly sidekick/brother. The 7 get into various situations. In one, they buy a car that breaks down. Another, a hurricane threatens the hotel. Together, the 7 get through everything. In each episode S Club perform at least one song, with their songs playing in the background while they go about their various adventures. One of the things that I like is the genuine affection they have for each other. They do okay on the acting, but then again they are playing themselves. Or rather, cariacatures of themselves. Rachel is displayed as a mini-Posh Spice all into hair, makeup, and clothes. Jo is a regular mechanic. Jon is out to save the animals. All in all, a fun 105 minutes."
3,"Maybe this was cool in the eighties, but now seems TIRED","I like Lydia's spoken word even in it's most ridiculous state. Intelligence mixed with ramblings that lead nowhere. This video is 80's enhanced. Really cheesey and shows New York City before the good, the bad and the tragic! But it's kinda nice to see Lydia in her youth looking somewhat pretty and spewing her anger even though it only ends up as a punchline to a joke about damaged women that doesn't help anyone in the end."
4,"DON'T SEE THE MOVIE, READ THE BOOK, IT WAS BETTER","The only reason I give this book a 7 is because it takes too long to get going. Once it does, it just don't stop. At first I thought there was no way I was going to read this book because it was too slow. BELIEVE ME IT AIN'T SLOW! If you saw the movie and didn't read the book, you got gipped. The movie sucked and was not worthy of the title. Read the book. That's all I gotta say about that... P.S. If you thought the movie was a massacre, just wait til you read this!"
2,Nothing But A Rip-Off Movie Waiting to Happen,"The only real inspirational part of The Lost World is the climax with the chameleon-like carnosaurs, a part that didn't make it to the movie. The characters are oh-so-thin, the two kids are annoying, and it's obvious from page one that Crichton's just trying to visualize the movie this will be made into. Not one of Crichton's best."
3,3 1/2 Stars: Disappointing,"I am not just talking about the book. I am talking about Crichton, this is the first book of his that was not a fresh idea. This book is essentially Jurassic Park, but with a couple of slight changes. I really disliked the fact that Crichton resurrected Ian Malcolm. He could have easily built the story around Grant, or Muldoon, or he could have introduced somebody new. The characters aren't well developed at all, the plot of the two is identical. It just can't measure up. All in all, this book is the weakest yet by Crichton, but still not too bad compared to everything else out there."
4,A book I could hardly put down,I recently re-read and enjoyed Jurassic Park so much that I searched for a sequel and found 'The Lost World'.I enjoyed the lost world just as much the first book!
5,Excellent book by an excellent author,Loved nearly every word of this book. I was a huge fan of the first book/movie and I walked out of the second movie it was so bad. It did not do justice to this book. I heard they are moaking a Jurassic Park 4 and can't imagine that will be any better. My advise is stick to the books. Crichton is one of a kind.
4,Michael Crichton Returns To Jurassic Park,"I was so excited when I finished Jurassic Park I couldn't wait to get the sequel for it. Now that I have also finished it I liked it a lot. in this book Ian Malcolm and his pals have to return to Jurassic Park after hearing reports of strange creature sightings on the island. So he goes to Jurassic Park again only to find more dinosaurs than he expected. In the end they have to cope with T-rex, Raptors, and other mean dinos. My favorite parts would have to be when King almost made it but let the raptors kill him, when Baselton got ripped to shreds by the T-rex, when they were in the trailer and the rex was trying to knock it off the cliff, and my all time favorite scene was when they were in the jeep shooting at the raptors and knocking them off the cliff. Well, I can't wait to read another book of Michael Crichton."
2,Not nearly as good as Jurassic Park,"Jurassic Park was a fabulous book that was interesting and engaging. This book is a cheap sequel (almost as bad as the movie was....well, maybe not). The ""spark"" present throughout JP is gone, and this hollow storyline and strange characters are all that's left. If you're interested in the ""rest of the story"", go ahead and give it a try (I did). Just take this review as a warning."
2,Boring,"Crichton may have a view of the world, but must he go on and on about and talk with all these terms that not everyone understands?The story is okay, but Crichton spends too much time explaining things with technical terms and what not. This book would be better off in the non-fiction pile with the title of ""Michael Chrichton's View of Evolution!""It's been a while since I read it, and it's sure never to leave the bookshelf on my accord."
2,A huge waste of time.,"I have read ""Jurassic Park"" at least four times, and love every scene, every character, every nuance. Therefore I was very excited about this sequel. Unfortunately, Crichton reused every scene (on a different island, of course), every character (with different names, of course), and there was precious little nuance in this mixed bag of bad writing. Even when Crichton gives up on character and goes straight to ""idea"" (""Andromeda Strain"" is a perfect, gripping example) he's generally interesting. Here, even the ""idea"" seemed forced and lacking."
4,Love it,So good...and the characters really grow on you! The science and studies of life involved really make the story move along.
1,A disappointing re-hash of the original.,"At the end of ""Jurassic Park"", the dinosaur island was destroyed. Butit turns out that they're still alive on another nearby island.There's a different team of good guys whose well-planned operationturns to chaos, and a different team of bad guys who stop at nothingtrying to recover the gene-manipulation technology. Ian Malcom, themathematician, is back from the dead to wisecrack us with his chaos-theoretical predictions. There are two different kids getting drawninto the operation by accident, again demostrating that people beyondthe age of twelve are no good at operating modern computer systems.And of course there's the main ingredient: a good helping of dinosaurs;cute pet dinos as well as vicious beasts slashing and eating people alive.The plot moves along much too predictably. If you haven't read ""JurassicPark"", read it instead, it's so much more original. If you did read it,read it again; ""The Lost World"" might give you some bad deja-vus."
3,Lost World is a real disappointment,"The Lost World is a poor rehash of the original Jurassic Park. I found the book enjoyable and worth reading for the entertainment value, but it had little substance. It didn't answer any questions left from the first JP. What happened to the raptors that made it to Costa Rica? Apparently, nothing. The Lost World brings back Ian Malcolm (who died in the first book), but ignores the other characters. Well, it doesn't completely ignore them in that it reinvents them. The characters are just pitiful replacements for the original characters. Lost World also uses old elements from the JP movie: T-Rex pushing vehicles off cliffs, computer-smart kids, etc. It's a fun read, but it is by no means a great book"
4,A sign of things to come from Chrichton?,"While the obvious end results practically mirrored that of Chrichton's earlier classic, Jurrasic Park, the side-by-side plot kept me guessing how the team was going to achieve survival.Tandem plots, twists and turns that would never seem to end only lead up to exactly what was originally expected, and the whole book ends almost as if the author ran out of paper and had to think of something quick to end it all.While the characters were fresh and well-created, something made me visualize them as the same people from JP.Jurassic Park was a tour-de-force that was a tough act to follow, and The Lost World just doesn't make the sequil that it should have."
3,dissapointing to some extent,Felt let down. Looks as if it was a sequal brought out more by monetary considerations rather than by a solid themeor plot.
2,Just another dino tale,"I think Mr Crichton didn't want to loose fans, so he didn't intend to make a new plot and a new story.He grabbed the old one and sticked to it. I felt dissatisfied with the Lost World because I was so anxious to read another tale like the great jurassic Park.But...nothing new"
3,A serious study after the shock value of Jurassic is over,This is the answer book for all the questions you had about Jurassic park. Crichton spends less time on shocking you about dinosuars and begins to answer the question of how? How did the dinosaurs survive without the Lysine? What happens to the major characters and did the project really work that well? Malcom returns to find the answers he had been hiding from in the LOST WORLD
4,No better than J. Park...,"Almost the nice place for the mental softlanding after that excitement in JP.Raptors, Rex, Compys, Stego, Triceratops, Apato and Duck-bills again. But no Dilos. Good-mother and Camelleons are new.Mainly observations of Dinos and killings of Raptors in the story. Interesting arguement on evolution and extinction. But not deep.The raptors were much smarter in JP, but now they are just the herd of stupid killing animals. Expected more interactions within the main charactors."
2,"Disappointing. A ""Jurassic Park"" clone...nothing new.","Essentially the same characters as ""Jurasic Park"" but the names have been changed. Plus, Crichton forgot that Ian Malcom was killed in ""JP"" and brought him back as a main character. Crichton can do better and has. Don't waste money on this book. Don't even go to the film, when it's made. Wait for the video and rent it from a Buck-a-Movie video rental"
3,Liked it,"As others have noted, this was not up to Jurassic Park, which I enjoyed a lot more. It WAS a page-turner and I didn't want to put it down. I understand why some authorsdon't want to do sequels, because they inevitably suffer in comparison"
3,the book was prety good,"The book was pretty good because I liked the way it was written I guess. It's about an island that used to be a dinosaur hatchery when Jurrasic Park was still in business, but now the dinosaurs are the only ones on the island. A group of scientists go there to observe them and see how dinosaurs might have become extinct, but the dinosaurs attack them, and they have to get off the island."
2,A disappointment,"If you want a good book, try Jurassic Park. It seems Crichton just made the book so directors could make another movie out of it. Compared to Jrassic Park, this book was BAD. If you are a Christian like me, don't read this book!! The thing that angered me was the whole plot was just talking about evolution. On the very first page, Malcolm is explaining evolution. Evolution is just Satan's way of making people turn away from God and His Word. Jurassic Park made little mention of evolution and stuck with the plot through the whole book. In this book, whle Malcolm and his bud are being attaked by Raptors and Tyrannosaurus Rex's, they decide to explain about exolution. Come on! They are about to be ripped in half and decide that it's a good time to talk about evolution! I was very disappointed after reading this book. If you want REALLY good books, try Frank Peretti."
2,I'm Lost!!!,"A very disappinting sequel after the spectacular Jurassic Park. The action is predictable. There are no major surprises. Most of this over 400-page book is filled with the ridiculous and confusing theories of Dr. Malcolm, ad nauseum. Other than that, there are the ubiquitous appearances of the raptors, three times might still be exciting, but thirty times is just plain bit annoying. A pot-boiler if there ever is one"
2,A disappointment in Crichton's Jewel of a Career,"Chrichton clearly had his mind on the money he'd make rather than the reader's enjoyment whem he scrawled this one out. It reads more like a script to a movie (which it will inevetalbly be) than a sience fiction novel. I feel Chrichton new that if he wrote a Dr. Seuss style book and labeled it ""Sequel to Jurassic Park"" he'd have no problem selling millions of copies. That fact is shown very clearly through ""The Lost World.&quot"
3,Should have left well enough alone,"Crichton's ability to weave an interesting and exciting story will keep you reading, but this is basically Jurassic Park rehashed and regurgitated without any fresh ideas or creative scientific concepts. This was obviously a movie studio inspired sequel"
4,"Good, but still disappointing","This is a good book, but not nearly as good as Jurrasic Park. The ending was very lame"
5,Crichton bests JP,"In many ways, ""The Lost World"" follows a formula that was laiddown in ""Jurassic Park."" But it is also an improvement. Whereas JPwas concerned with the ethical ramifications of biotechnology, the sequel focuses on issues in modern evolutionary theory. Through the character Ian Malcom, Crichton suggests that there is more to heredity than genes. This novel is somewhat tamer than JP, but the continual scene shifts keep up the suspense. It's too bad that Spielberg just wanted to remake ""Jaws"" with dinosaurs."
3,Crichton Adapts Jurassic Park for Younger Audiences,"Michael Crichton's first dinosaur novel, Jurassic Park, was awonderful, terrifying book. The research and time put into JP made itwonderful. His second foray into the world of cloned dinosaurs was much less original. Rather than take the approach of the first novel, which was very ""scientific"" and plausible, he opted to write a screenplay treatment in novel form. The book was quite enjoyable, but it reads like a junior adaptation of Jurassic Park. As I read The Lost World, I found myself slightly disappointed in the lack of ""scientific"" detail. What was there seemed out of place in this B-grade monster movie book. Fortunately, Crichton is a skilled writer, and made this novel worth reading. Just be warned that it is a simpler, easier read than JP or Congo."
2,Really?,I finished the book and all I could say was that. Really? It was just a complete rehash of Jurassic Park. Michael Crichton has done so much better than this. Just should not have been attempted.
4,Good sequal but not great,I was quite excited waiting for this book to come out and when I finished it I was somwhat dissapointed with it. I think it could have been better it just seemed like a rush job in order to make a sequal to the movie. I did enjoy the new dinosaurs though it was quite exciting to see them in action.
5,about the things that should not be but what they always are,the book was great. that's one of the few things i can say about it besides spectacular and provocative. it was so incredibly detailed and intense. it was as if i was in the book and running from the dinosaurs along with the caracters in the book.
1,Hollywood cliches for sale,"This book is for those who want to close their eyes to logic, consistency and common sense and get cheap thrills. Paper-thin characters serve as dinosaur bait in a short-story-sized plot. Consistency and believability are sacrificed at nearly every turn to keep those thrills a coming. I quickly found myself laughing at the contrivances used to bloat the page count with suspense, and ended up just skimming past many scenes in the hopes of finding something with actual meat. If you love implausible chase scenes, moronic bad guys and made-for-TV style suspense, you'll love this hackneyed effort.Because I would expect more than Hollywood cliches from this author, I have to rate this as close to the worst book I have ever read."
1,The Lost World,"I truly hated this book, Micheal Crichton seemed to be in it only to make another movie. If there was a rating I could give it that was less than zero, I would. The part of the book that I hated the most was the cussing, not saying that I can't deal with cussing, but this book was like listening to 5 rap CD's at once. I reccomend that you avoid this book."
1,The Films are better,"This is not as good as the first Jurassic Park book. There is too much talk about evolution and stuff so much that I completely skipped over those sections. The movie was kind of boring but is better than this. Also in the movies I actually like Malcolm, especially since he's played by Jeff Goldblum. In this book however he rants way too much about evolution and diseases and stuff. And when did he become a dino expert? If I were him I would just make sure to never go to that island again. Finally the worst part about this book is........................bad language. In Jurassic Park I remember them saying a lot, but imagine this 20 bad words hitting you in the face every five pages, plus 7 of those were the F-word. In Jurassic Park they never said the F-word! Seriously people who wants to see the F-word printed on a paper like that?"
2,"""Lost"" World","Okay, even when ignoring the fact that Ian Malcolm is alive the second time around, one is hard pressed to find anything truly ""good"" about this sequel. With a mediocre plot (""let's go find us some dinosaurs and let 'em loose in California! Maybe they'll eat Disneyland!) and almost no character development, it makes me wonder just how many dollar signs it takes to forget how to write a decent story."
1,Worst excuse for a blockbuster ever,"Now here is the perfect reason why authors should not be given multimillion dollar deals to write sequels. The Lost World is one of the most moronic pieces of trash to ever escape out onto the open market. It features badly writen, unlikable characters getting chased by dinosaurs on an island that's name must translate to ""Plot Device."" The very dead Ian Malcolm returns to allow Jeff Goldblum to star in the movie version,and contributes nothing to the story other than more boring Chaos thoery. Okay, at least he's consistant. After all anyone who actually read the original (no classic but at least better than this,) was not about cloning dinosaurs but Chaos theroy. Too much tech and no heart whatsoever, and some of the dumbest action scenes ever to be dreamed up. I hope the publishers asked for their money back."
3,Creighton has sucumbed to formuli and has abandoned research,"Creighton started out as a scientist/historian who was also able to tell a good story. Over time, he has taken the easy road to ""action / adventure"". Lost World is an unfortunate example of social awareness and equity with facile characters, but little attention to science, technology or plot"
3,Suspense but too soft,"This book is a suspense book. However the story start in the middle and not to hard. I will call too soft because there are no rhitme in the story. I like the story, but not getting tied when I read the boo"
2,Michael Crichton is in his own little Lost World,"This will be short folks: Michael Crichton started a downwards spiral as a writer when he wrote Rising Sun. Don't get me wrong, that's a great book, but he started writing trash novels that really aren't worthwhile and seem to be ready to be made into a movie. The book was ok, the movie was worse. I think if the movie had followed the book, it would have been ok. As for the book, it's hopeless. Crichton needs to come back from whatever planet he's been on and start writing great stuff again. He needs to realize he's writing a novel, not a script"
4,Typical of Crighton a page turner all the way,Micheal crighton really knows how to blend science fact withscience fiction. It makes him one of the better writers out there.
2,The Lost Petting Zoo,"Save your money and skip both the book and the movie. If youmust, see the shoddy movie, but avoid thisfluff-pretending-to-be-a-book. This only gets a ""4"" because it's better (and shorter) than ""Ender's Game"" and ""The Diamond Age"". Notice how inarticulate the reviews are from those who gave it a ""9"" or ""10""? That should tell you something."
4,Enjoyable reading,"The story continues after Jurassic Park and was wellwritten. However, there is no discussion as to how the dinos arrivedat this island. Was it the shaving can? The T-rex's were wonderful in this novel. I believe there should be another novel about the result of the shaving can. Did it wash out to sea or is it waiting to get you? Another excellant novel to be written."
1,A major flop,"It was with great anticipation that I read this book. I have been a Crichton fan for a long time and think the 'Jurassic Park' was one of his best books. This book is the sequel and continues where the first book left off.To my knowledge, Crichton had never written a sequel to one of his books prior to this one. After the original novels success and the blockbuster movie based on the book, one can not help but think that Crichton felt some pressure (from Hollywood, fans, and the big payday - who knows) to continue the story.Well, this book falls far short of the original. This book seems to follow the same script as the first book, but the characters are changed a little. It just isn't very creative regarding the characters, the premise of the story and without those it has nothing. I actually got the feeling when reading this book that some of it was written with movie scenes in mind.My advice would be to read the original and skip this book all together. You will not be missing much."
2,Lost World is a Lost Dud,"Ian Malcolm leads a group of scientists to a lost world of dinosaurs. Overall, this book is a dud because you expect to have Dr. Grant hunting down the raptors again, but it is just really confusing. This is more of a sequal to the movie than the book."
1,Movie Script Mistakenly Presented as a Book,"I started not to bother offering my opinion but I couldn't let such claptrap go unanswered. It literally exudes ""cinema"" on every page. The story is flimsy (a farce really) and the action is so predictable that I guessed the end of each chapter midway through. One can detect the scenes written with the (new) movie in mind. Compared to the first book, it lacks credible science, mystery, believable characters, and a plot. Once again, the author is at his worst with character development - you just can't feel close to any of these cartoon action figures. Here's hoping for a better job next time."
3,A Good Novel But Not A Great One.,"What I can't understand about a lot of novels nowadays is that they hardly live up to the title or to the main plot. I've read tons of novels that are 300+ pages and the majority of the novels focus on the regular everyday lives of characters! Boring! Anywho, the Lost World, I'm sad to say, is one of those novels. It starts out with scientists on an island burning up an already dead hadrosaur corpse, goes into two-hundred pages of character lives, and briefly brings in the dinosaurs. I am a big dinosaur fan and I had high hopes for this one! The movie was way better than this one! The dinosaurs are not involved as much as what they want you to believe. I don't know what these reviewers in the novel see what's so great about this book, but they must read some boring books if they think this one is good! It's an alright read overall and the descriptions of the dinosaurs are good, but it doesn't live up to the title and the hype."
3,Average,An ok sequel to the first book. I enjoyed the discussions on evolution. The action sequences didn't seem to be as exciting. The movie didn't follow book at all. It would have been better if it had.
2,"""Dinosaurs don't scare me!"" and nither did this.","After one of the most scarest books written, this sequel to Jurassic Park is some what of a let down. Didn't scare me at all. Way, way, way too plotty. Too much destription that was not needed. Original was better. Had more imagination than this. Still, if you want to try to enjoy it, go ahead. But too bland for my tastes."
5,THE FIRST TIME A BOOK HAS SCARED ME SO MUCH!!! I LOVE IT,"I am a frequent reader of horror, though I do not read it for the ""scare-value."" I am very immune to being scared (i've read horror all my life). I must say, however, that this is the first time a book has scared the snot out of me.I was upset by the beginning of the book because of the preasance of Ian Malcom. I love his character dearly, but he quite clearly died in Jurassic Park. Crichton made a very cheap resurection of Malcom, however, for the purposes of this book. Eventually that irratation faded and I got on with the bookI made it through most of it intrigued and intelectually stimulated (as one often does reading a book by Crichton). When I hit the last 80 or so pages, however, I had a creepy feeling set into my spine that followed me well after I finished the book.A must read, and a wonderful thriller."
3,OK. I lied! I went ahead and read it!!,"I didn't think that I would be able to stomach this novel by M.C. after Jurassic Park. But, just to be curious I went ahead and read it. This book was more BORING than the first book!! Why must he continue to bore us!! Please, let's not hope for a Jurassic Park 3!!!!!!!!!! Please make him stop writing about things that he has no idea about. His other books are great!! But these dino books are just really bad!!"
1,I can't believe this thing was published!!! AGH!,"In the movie ""Scream 2"" the characters talked about how sequels screw things up. The characters must have read The Lost World. I love Crichton's novels but this story leaks inconsitancy in it's science. Apparently it's a good thing those Costa Rica officials decided not to bury Malcolm at the end of the first book because HE'S BAAAAACK!! What am I supposed to do with this thing? Let's take a look at this plot: -Malcolm makes a lot of speeches about a new revised Chaos Theory -He and two kids (obvious) go to a convenient island where there are Jurassic Park dinosaurs (obvious too) they run around, Malcolm says ""I told you so"" a lot, Bad guys get eaten, everyone goes home. I don't even see what the ending is. What's been solved here? Spielberg didn't put much into the movie, Crichton didn't put much into the novel. The whole concept is just a coaster for cash."
5,"A heart-pounding, fast page flipper, dino adventure!!","This is the best book I have ever read in my life. It was so much fun, I even got a detention in school for not stopping and listening to the teacher. It was so much better than the movie. But personally, I think the movie stunk. I knew this was going to be better as soon as the reached the park. In a little bit I am going to read it again!!!! Also th book 'Jurassic Park' was really good. Pure entertainment is what Crichton has enhanced to the world!!"
2,"Well written, but slow.","I liked the book for two reasons, one, it was well written, and two, the main characters were very well established. I did not like the book because some of the characters that played important roles in the plot were not well established, and there were several pages of code that went simply over my head. I would recomend the book to a person with great patience and does not mind gore. I would also recomend to read this book after seeing the movie!"
5,a page-turner edge-of-the-seat book,a great book!!! one of the best ive ever read and im a book worm!!!
4,A great sci-fi type novel!,This book was amazing!Michael Crichton is a very smart writer.I loved the action and suspense.It starts off kinda slow but ends up really fast-paced and just amazing.I couldn't put it down! I recommend it to anyone who loves reading fast-paced action/adventure novels.
3,A pleasant novel,"Usually, sequels have trouble living up to their predecessors, which is the case here. The dinos have a bit of trouble staying magical. And the underlying evolutionary theme is a bit more longish than the average Chrichton essay. However, it is still a Chrichton novel, which means it packs a lot of action, spiced with interesting thoughts along the way. I would still recommend it."
4,Really good read,Of course the book isn't up to the originals standards but it's a great read all the same. Definitely a must read for Jurassic park fans.
3,Interesting. Somewhat repetitive of the theme.,"The book differs in many respects from the movie. The story is more interesting if you read the book in addition to watching the movie. If you only watch the movie and do not read the book, you will definitely be missing out. The story as told through the book is more compelling, although the movie is exciting as well. I take issue with some aspects of the portrayal of Ian Malcolm in this novel. If you read the first book, these issues should be obvious. Many elements of this story feel highly repetitive of points learned from the first novel. Regardless, the story is exciting and compelling. There are some scientific tangents which are interesting to a point; however, some of them are rather long. The book takes much longer to get to the action than the movie does. Patience is required. That said, I do not regret the time I spent reading this book and I recommend it for others."
3,"Big dinosaurs, little teeth","Okay. Everyone says the sequel is not as good as the original. This is true for this venture. It was a money thing I'm sure. Not that Mr. Crichton wouldn't have done a sequel, but I have a feeling it would have been later coming. Ian was great, as usual. Sarah was pretty good (she's no Ellie), and Dodgson was his old wicked self. It is a fun read, but nothing to get the neurons really firing. One thing in its favor, the movie was horrible in comparison to the book. Sorry Mr. Spielberg. Dodgson's fate at the end was worth the read."
4,Does exactly what it says on the tin,"Jurassic Park was a great book, and the sequel is predictably entertaining. It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it still makes for some gripping reading. As for it's faults, well, the ending isn`t as good as it might have been and the characters aren't exactly fantastic. Could have been better, but it was, all in all, what I expected of a sequel."
3,Not as bad as some reviewers made it out to be.,"The Lost World was a pretty enjoyable read. Though not in the same category as Jurrasic Park, the story as well as additional insights on the subject was interesting to say the least. In my very subjective opinion - if you were dazzled by Jurassic Park and are totally content with its ending, then I don't think it'd be a good idea to read this, however if you're a glutton for more of the same - get it!"
4,"Very Good , Seq- of JP",It was one of the best books I have read that was a second part of a two part story.I hope the movie is as good!
1,Retread of Jurassic Park without the wit or surprise.,"If ""Jurassic Park"" was ""Jaws"" redux, then ""The Lost World"" is ""Jaws 2"".I mean really, I was hoping maybe Crichton would BUILD on the previous book, not redo it. You make us wait over 100 pages to show us a dinosaur? Ohh scary. That sort of suspense only works once.And I loved the replacement genius-kids. Give me a break.On the plus side, Malcolm does get to spout some nifty stuff about chaos theory.Don't waste the afternoon on this book. Hope Spielberg gets the movie right!"
3,"Okay, but I thought I read this the first time around.","Crichton could have taken his dinosaurs somewhere else afterJurassic Park -- like the mainland, or a city -- but instead we have another island (""Whoops!We forgot about that one!""), essentially the same characters(not especially well developed), and a fundamentally identicalplot. I enjoyed the writing, and most of the incidents areexciting, but I finished the book dissatisfied. Jurassic Parkwas a neat idea, well executed. The Lost World is well enoughexecuted, but it's the same idea."
3,Evolutionsim's Book,"This novel contains a lot of evolution theory, this a novel or a science book?This matter can degrade the quality of a book."
2,excitement and action but not much else,"The success of the author should not blind people to his lack of literary merit. The inclusion of the teenagers is a concession to a potentially large number of watchers of the spin-off film, as with Jurassic Park. Given American tastes (a contradiction in terms?), the fact of a book being a best-seller is reason enough to avoid it, at least for those who want something more than momentary excitement. Of all his fiction, by far the most interesting novel was The Andromeda Strain, and this, in comparison, is nearly infantile. More pulp fiction for American numbskulls."
5,Better than the movie!,12 Raptors 2 T-Rexes and thier baby's a few Carnotaruses a bunch of compys and 10 people all on one island your bound to get action
5,"GREAT BOOK,BAD MOVIE",I really don't understand why people are giving this book bad reviews.I loved it and could not put it down for five minutes and I review books harsher than anyone.I found the scientific theories very interesting and exciting to read.It was the perfect sequel to jurassic park.This book proved to me how great michael crighton is as an author.I hope he keeps making books like this.I only wish the movie folllowed the book more.I don't understand why they didn't because it could of been so much better
5,A hell of a lot better than the movie,"This book gives you the real facts of the dinosaurs that ruled the world millions of years ago, unlike the movie, which was way out of line. It was like in the movie that the moviemakers just made up new dinosaurs because the fact is, the movie's ALL WRONG. For example, compys, those little dinos, are scavengers. SCAVENGERS. Definition of scavenger: animal that eats the dead or dying. In the movie, the compys ate perfectly alive people. The people were not at all dead. At least Michael Crichton knew what he was talking about, unlike the moviemakers who tried to make it as awesome as they could. It wasn't awesome. It SUCKED. Crichton's all right, the moviemakers are all WRONG. I really liked the book, I couldn't find anything wrong with it, except for the fact that sometimes he goes on and on and on about one small subject. All in all, I enjoyed the book"
2,Didn't get past first tape,"I stopped listening to this book after I discovered that Ian was brought back to life. As if all the movie changes for JP weren't enough, the book sequel had to bring dead characters back to life. This bugged me so much I had to stop"
2,Badly Written Movie Script!!!,"I am an avid fan of Michael Crichton, however, I find it hard to believe that he actually wrote this piece of Hollywood trash. Written as a sequel to Jurassic Park it not only failed to follow the logical next step from that book, it brings up a scenario that was not even hinted at in the original work. I found the plot shallow and character development non-existent. This novel lacked the excitement and wonder of Jurassic Park, but no doubt it will translate well on the ""Big Screen"". Too bad I was reading it in a ""little"" book!!"
2,disappointing sequel to an amazing book,As I was reading this book I wondered if this book was actually written by Crichton. The plot was almost a carbon copy of Jurassic Park except that it was much simpler. The driving force behind the popularity of Crichton's books is their originality. This demonstrates that Crichton can only write about a topic once before he is simply rewriting. He should avoid sequels and stick to writing good books about new topics
3,this book was ok.,I thought the book was ok. It was hard to follow. Like when Levine was the only one on the island and it kept switching back to the mainland.
5,The Second Best Book I Ever Read!!!!,"The Lost World is Fabulous!!! I don't understand why some people are giving this book 1 and 2 stars. This book is the second best book I read (second to Jurassic Park, I wrote a review about that)!!! The movie is...OK...I guess. Really, read this book!!!!"
4,The best action and suspense ever!,"This was a very good book. If you like action and suspense, this is the book I think you should read. You never know what is going to happen next in the story. It was nothing like the movie, and it wasn't as good as Jurassic Park, but it sure had me suprised around the ending"
3,Crichton sells out,"Let me first say that JP is one of my favorite books and I'm a huge Crichton fan. Given that, I have to say that The Lost World was a huge disappointment for me. It is clear that as a book, it makes a helluva good action film. That's about all there is here. He obviously wrote this book just to sell the movie rights.There's plenty of thrilling action here but all of the magic storytelling of Jurassic Park is gone. The characters are flat and the plot was alot more original when it was done 65 years ago in King Kong.The book is basically a script for the movie, if you've seen it don't bother reading it."
4,The shadow of it's predecessor,"Another brilliant work on behalf of Michael Crichton. Although a sequel of the former best seller Jurassic Park, Lost World manages to stand on its own with a new plot, new location, and totally different characters, with the exception of a few. However, one small detail sort of underplays reality, in how Ian Malcom, who was only a supporting character in the previous novel, becomes the main character in this one."
2,This book dissapointed me.,The Lost World in no way led up to my expectations after reading the classic Jurrasic Park. It was obviously was rushed in order to have a main idea for the film's script. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY.
1,MOVIE SCRIPT MISTAKENLY PUBLISHED AS NOVEL,"I started not to bother offering my opinion but I couldn't let such claptrap go unanswered. Itexudes ""cinema"" on every page - The story is flimsy (a farce really) and the action is so predictable that I guessed the end of each chapter midway through. One can detect the scenes written with the (new) movie in mind. Compared to the first book, all is lacks is credible science, mystery, believable characters, and a plot. Once again, the author is at his worst with character development - you just can't feel close to any of these cartoon action figures. Here's hope for a better job next time."
5,The Lost World: Jurrasic Park,"I must say this book kept me on the edge of my seat. At least most of the time. At parts it did get boring, referring to the parts in which Malcom was on the morphine, and when he was explaining things. But other than that, it was intense. The Parasours at the beginning had me scared, and Richard Levine was so casual. The raptor attacks were so well detailed, I was amazed. The trailor scene was a story in itself. Very suspenseful. This was a great book, and I have read many Michael Crichton books, and he did a very good job on this book."
3,"Good, but not as good as Jurassic Park.","This book was twice as long as Jurassic Park. About half of it could have been edited out, there was that much filler in it. Many parts were excellent but they were infused with often tedious detail that detracted from the action. The first half of the book tended to drag on for a bit. The second half was much, much better. Still, all in all, a good read."
3,Jurassic Park - again,"Still a good story line - but no where near as good as the original. I didn't like the way the brought Malcom back - he died in Jurassic park - no if's and's or but's. Granted, Jeff Goldblum made a great Malcom in the movie - but the fact is - he shouldn't have been in the Lost World - though - sudden reincharnation's aside - It's still a fun, exciting read!!"
3,"Sequel not equal, but still fun enough to read.","Make no mistake about it, The Lost World was written simply to make a huge amount of money for its author. Lots of mayhem and narrow escapes, but it feels forced and contrived. The characters reaction to the dinos is listless and, unless directly in harms way, almost emotionless. Still when Crichton does whip out the teeth and claws it's a fairly exciting waste of time, just not the experience of the first book. Recommended only to the addicted dino and/or monster movie fan."
4,The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"When Strange, reptillion forms wash up on the beaches of Eastern Costa Rica, Ian Malcolm thinks that it might have something to do with a project he is working on called Site B. After careful research, he, as well as others, finds out where Site B is located. Unfortunetly, so does Dr. Dodgson, the head of a company called BioSyn. he goes to the island to retrieve some dinosaurs.Meanwhile, Ian choses to go to the island with a group of people to do some research. while there, he finds that two children, Arby and Kelly, have snuck aboard the vehicles. he must now take care of them while protecting everyone else on the island."
2,Jurassic Park?,I have heard many of you saying how the book is better than the movie. Wrong! At least the movie has more continuity with the prequel than the book does! Malcom DIED in the first book. He is some how alive in this one. It seemed Michael Crichton sold out on this one for those who had seen the first movie and not read the first book.
3,Not a true sequel!,"I read Jurrasic Park and loved it, I joyfully purchased the sequel The Lost World because I wanted to know the outcome of the migration of the Raptors. I felt cheated! The author didn't give the reader any credit for having read the prequel. I enjoyed the story despite the incongruities between this book and the prequel."
5,Fantastic,"This book was great. It's to bad the movie was so horrible. I don't know why Speilberg didn't follow the book or characters. The book was so good. With great characters,more dinosaurs and lots of adveture this is definately worth a read."
1,Sequel a flop,"I am extremelly disappointed with this book. It seems as though this book was a bit of a ""sell-out."" After all, using virtually the same plot simply because the first one sold so well makes me look at this writer with a little less respect. This was a very bad job, and it goes a ways towards why book sequels are so risky."
4,The best prehistoric book ever,"I gave The Lost World 4 stars.It was pretty good, but I think that Jurassic Park is a little bit better that The Lost World because of the plot difference and different ending.So read Jurassic Park and The Lost World and end up shocked"
2,Not comparable to Jurassic Park,"Given, Jurassic Park was an outstanding book, so because The Lost World didn't compare to that is not why I'm rating this book low. The lack of creativity is clearly obvious, this book lacked a good plot entirely. Plus, for fifty or so pages, I was lost, had I remembered to refer to the map, I may not have been lost so much. All though this may have dimmed down my interest, it still was only exciting for the first 100 pages."
5,The BEST Book I Have Ever Read!,"""The Lost World"" (book) is SO much better than the movie. It explains everything and describes everything in detail. I read this book when I was ten and I couldn't put it down! By now, I've at least read it fourty times. It also is educational for the not intellectually gifted."
2,This is a really bad sequel!,"When I began to read this book, I was expecting a lot more from it, but it was basically a rewrite of Jurassic Park (and how did Malcom get back when Muldoon knew he was dead?!) . Mr. Crichton, maybe you should write this book all over again."
3,Justice?,Show me the right way to live life. That's the moral of this one.Ian Malcolm has always been my Favorite Crichton character. He exhibits the true thinking mind.It's a must have.(^_^)
4,THE SECOND CHAPTER IN THE SECOND LORD OF THE FLIES,"This is a very fun novel that is an improvement over the fist book by one star. As with the first one there is a load of ""THE LORD OF THE FLIES"" book material that I have noticed. THE MOVIE IS FIVE TIMES AS GOOD AS THE NOVEL. I think that the movie is better because of some corny scientific theory crap and unlikable themes. A few people say that there is not a lot of book material in the movie when there is a load of it in the classic movie. My guess is since they can't appreciate it they cannot see it. Overall, I would recomend this book to any Jurassic Park fan. I thank you for reading my review."
1,jurassic park was the man's last good book,"is it just me or is it fun to find a book/movie/product that obviously sucks and read all the 1 star reviews of said item? it's always good for a laugh. today i'm looking at the 'The Lost World'. this books is so lame that it was the first that i stopped reading halfway through cuz it was so dumb. this book is as bad as the worst summer movie you're ever likely to see. predictable, COMPLETELY unscientific, corny.. ridiculous. it was over for me when the kids stowed away in the rv and ended up in the jungle. terrible. i could look past the fact that chrichton ressurrected malcolm from the dead if the book was good enough but this thing.. i don't even know how it ended. interestingly enoughm, this was the first of a serious of MC books that i tossed halfway through. the others were Airframe and that one about time travel. i eventually finished the time travel one, but it was so forgettable that i can't even remember the name of it."
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book!,"I read this book when it first came out... I believe in the (old?) saying, ""The book is always better than the movie."" With this, it rings true. This was the first book, in a long time, that I couldn't put down; where I'd turn off the tv or stop doing things I truly liked, so that I could go read! I sped right thorough it. I recommended it to my cousin, and she loved it as well. When the movie came out, we were so anxious to see it. Boy, what a let down! The movie sucked so much! It didn't even follow the book! There were so many good parts in the book that the movie just cut out! I couldn't believe that. As I said, ""The book is better than the movie."""
5,This is one of the best sequels I've read in a long while.,"This was a really great book because it brought the best dinosaurs fromJurassic Park into the wild. Also, the best character, in my mind,Ian Malcolm, returns in this book. This book kept my attention the whole waythrough. It was very suspenseful which is what kept my attention"
5,It was wonderful!,"I don't know what people are talking about when they saythis is a ""pitiful rehash"" of JP. It's really good for along road trip. I wouldn't say it was better than Crichton'sother book ""Sphere,"" though."
2,A far cry from Jurassic Park.,"Micheal has cramped to much theories and philosophies in this book.Instead of being adventurous, The Lost World is being veryphilosophical. Almost every few pages of actions were followedby another few pages of theories of dinosaurs extinction. I managed tofinish this book because I don't want to waste the money Ispent on the book."
3,The importance of parents!,"This book is a sequel to Crichton's ""Jurassic Park."" An island off the coast of Costa Rica has been discovered to have been the development factory for the dinosaurs that had been used in Jurassic Park (this book taking place about five years after the events described in the earlier novel). However, scientists note some problems with regards to the dinosaur population on this island: for example, there are far too many predators for such a small island, there are very few mature dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs clearly are behaving abnormally. While this is a fun book to read (particularly with respect to the discussion of why organisms become extinct and the observation that, without the teaching influence of parents, individuals would not know correct behavioral patterns needed for a particular colony of that organism) there were unfortunately some obvious scientific errors (e.g., with respect to prions)."
4,A Descent Sequel,"After reading The Lost World I would say it was a good read if you enjoyed Jurassic Park. It isn't as good as the first dino novel written by Crichton, but it is a very descent sequel. It features Ian Malcolm who is a returning character from the first novel. Even though Crichton supposedly killed him at Jurassic Park I found his tale of resurrection believible, considering how the media is this day and age. I have always believed that a book is better than the movie that is made after it, and I would agree that this novel is better the movie version. I found the characters Arby and Levine to be enjoyable and amuzing, and after reading the book I wish they were included in the motion picture. If you like dinosaurs, science, or anything Crichton writes, you should find that this novel has something you will enjoy."
3,At least he didn't write a third!,"That's the only thing to be thankful for. The third movie was a straight action-thriller with none of the pseudo-cerebalism of two. The book is a slightly different story. It is obviously a vehicle for making another movie, as it lacks the complex plot devices and technical details that are so rich in Crighton's other books. The characters are fairly well developed, but again, not as rich as in other works (especially Sphere). The book has good pacing and elegant detailing, but it isn't up to the standards I set for the author. If you're a diehard fan, get the book. Otherwise, check out others like Sphere or Airframe."
5,T-REX IS HEAR TO STAY.,THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD IS HEAR GET IT SOON BEFORE ITS EXETIKT LIKE REX COMPEYS & STEG DLM
1,"CRiCHTON SUFFERS FROM ""SORRY SEQUEL SYNDROME""","Michael Crichton has fallen prey to what I like to call ""Sorry Sequel Syndrome."" The Lost World is probably one of the worst written and boring novels I have read in my fifteen year life. By now even I know the do's and don'ts of a sequel.This book does not establish characters very well. If you were hoping to expand more on the character of Ian Malcolm in this book, read the first book again because you won't find the character you thought you knew here.The children in the story are pretty much there only to serve the classic adventure story cliche of the ""children in peril."" All throughout the book, we see traces of the children in the first book in this one.If you are looking for more Jurassic adventure, I advise you to look somewhere other than this book because you will only be dissapointed."
5,Bone-chilling,"I'm sure most of you have either seen the movie or read the book Jurassic Park. This book is the sequel to Jurassic Park. The Lost World is about Site B. Site B is where John Hammond, the creator of Jurassic Park, originally bred the park's dinos. Now, he is struggling to keep it the way it is: undisturbed, where it is the dinos' property & theirs only. So Hammond then sends a team of reasearchers to the island, including Ian Malcom, Sarah Harding, and Eddie Carr. These adventurers not only get attacked by Velociraptors, T-Rexes, and Compys, but have THE ultimate adventure. I highly reccomend this book to any Jurassic Park lover."
4,A much needed sequel,"The reason for four stars as compared to five is that no sequel can ever surpass their origional. This is an excelent novel and should be read after the first and before viewing the film. The first book captured the reader to an extent at which, even though the novel reached a resolution the reader wanted more to happen. Michael Crichton almost always leaves his pieces open for second part, he usually chooses not to act on it due to the overwhelming success of the film. In this case his first book did as well as the film, yet the viewers yearned for one more thrill before they put it to bed."
4,"Good, but not what I expected",Lost World was an interesting book but it didn't fit as a sequel to Jurassic Park. Of course Hollywood killed both books. I hope that one day in the NEAR future that they might get a clue.
3,Let's not blame Mike. . .,"How about putting the blame on Hollywood, the publishers and any other person or company that would benefit from the BIG bucks to be made due to the phenominal success of the original (and great idea of J.P.). It is definitely not Mike's best work, but neither was it a good piece of work by his publisher as evidenced by the unedited paragraphs where the word ""she"" (I think--a bit of time has passed since I have read the book) was used almost 50 times. A ridiculous deadline is commonly to blame for the lack of quality control in a production like this."
1,Thw worst book I have ever read,Michael Crichton is not an author. He is a script writer for Hollywood. Not only was this book--or better yet a manuscript--written to be made into a movie but it was also a horrible piece of trash (The movie was even more idiotic). The story had no ambition behind it and it proves that Crichton never was a good author and he never will be as long as he writes books for Hollywood instead of readers.
5,"Fantastic, Gripping, Michael ' s The Boss here no doubt.",My brother got this book and I found the gripping as a word of review from the Sunday Times. I started on to find a little slow paced but eventually I discovered that the sucessor to the Jurassic Park was one of the most gripping book I had ever read. This is my first book written by Michael Crichton and I found that even though the subject is so unknown to people he writes with so alarming conviction that one really starts believing that a Lost World is still there. I took the book and kept only when it was over. I recommend it for World Class reading. He has indulged me to read more thrillers. I am certainly one more to his large fan club.
2,Dissapointing Sequel!,"The Lost World was a dissapointing novel. Some of the scenes were good but it was a lot like its sequel. Many of the scenes just dragged. The overall context was pretty good but it was not the greatest sequel. One of the downfalls of the novels was the constant ""the dinosaurs move so much like birds"" and ""the velociraptors are so intelligent."" These two staements were repeated numerous times already in the first novel. This book is nowhere as good as its prequel."
1,The worst book Michael Crichton has written...,"Really, how can so many people actually be writing favourable reviews about this book?In general I would call myself a Michael Crichton fan, but this is such a clone of Jurassic Park that I could hardly believe he had written it.This should have stayed as the script for another trashy sequel.."
4,it a really good book,"This is a really great book and i recamend you read it but if youknow all about Jarasic Park it's almost the same. They find dino's and have to ""avoid"" them just like J.P. But i still hope that you read it"
3,Just another book by Michael Crichton,"Fans all over the world were expecting the sequel to Jurassic park. Here in Brazil, where I live, the book came a little too late, so I expected it more anxiously. Well, I bought it and read it, and it just made me feel silly. The book is too much alike Jurassic Park, changing the places and the characters. Besides that, the usual Crichton book. Thrilling and stuff. But that's all"
5,Very Good Sequel,I though that the book was great. It picks up where the movie lets off not where theoriginal book ends. The reason for this is that Ian Malcomson dies in the firstbook but not in the movie. Except for this paradox it is very well adapted for anyonewho either enjoyed the movie or the book. I read the book first before the movieand loved both.
3,Basically the same story as Jurassic Park,"I enjoyed Jurassic Park & I enjoyed The Lost World--I started & finished it on a plane. But I didn't think it was anything original--it had the bloated egoist, the female scientist, Ian Malcolm, a evil character, and two kids who didn't belong there and of course, the dinosaurs. What was new? But I still enjoyed it"
2,a big let-down,"Yes, it's Jurassic Park all over again, but without the excitement that characterized the first book. I read Jurassic Park before I even knew there was going to be a movie, and it easily ranks up there with Sphere and The Andromeda Strain, but this is just the same story with the names of the characters changed, presumably to prevent Crichton from plagiarizing himself. I used to think Congo was his worst novel. Not any more"
3,"SAME AS ORIGINAL, BUT STILL WORTH READING","This books has some flaws in it. For one thing, Ian Malcolm, the main character, has come back from the dead( In JP, Malcolm died).The charachters are similar to the JP charachters( man, woman, 2 kids, raptors, T-rex).The outcome is just like JP; some escape, some are eaten.But this book is still fun to read, even if it is the same as JP"
1,Put it out of its misery,"I loved Jurassic Park. As a result I was excited to read the sequel. I have never plowed through a book so much in my life wishing it would end. The entire book lacked the insight, knowledge, and fantastic ideas that are trademarks of great Crichton books like Jurassic Park, Sphere, and Andromeda Strain."
1,OK pulp story - but very wrong understanding of evolution.,"If you read this, please ignore the pseudo-scientific pablum that parades as scientific discussions of evolution, extinction, cultural history, etc. None of this stuff is even close to scientific. If you are interested, see any of the works of Stephen Jay Gould, who debunks just about everything ""theoretical"" in this book regarding evolution."
2,very boring,"This book was just very boring, felt like a lecture, and I think must have been written just to cash in."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have read this book two times to try and decide if I like it or hate it. Jurassic Park is one of my favorite Michael Crichton books. But I found The Lost World to be merely a rewrite. There are basically the same characters in the two books: the big hero, (Grant, Malcom) the strong woman, (Sattler, Harding) the kids, (Lex & Tim, Kelly & Arby), and the anti-hero (Nedry, Dodgson). However, this book does contain some original ideas and has it's great moments. (The ending when the raptors are coming in the building is full of imagery-I could feel them coming in!) So, I don't love it, yet I don't hate it. I suggest reading it for yourself and finding out."
2,What's Malcom doing here!?,"This book is a sellout to the movie. The first book, for those who didn't read it, is a good deal better than the movie. Sure, it takes more time, but it's worth it. Movie made a big mistake; Malcom was supposed to die. Lost World makes a bigger mistake; ignored the previous book, followed the movie. Arrrrgh! If they want to make the two movies agree, fine. They could have simply messed up another book plot and done OK. The book, however, should have stayed consistent. I was unable to make it through the book beyond a very shallow read because the whole premis was false. I give it the extra star for the interesting detail, but that is a general characteristic of the author and not of this book. If you are a genuine Jurassic Park fan, watch out!"
4,I Hope The Movie Is Better,I enjoy Michael Crichton books. I have read almost all of them. The Lost World is not a bad novel. It just is not Jurrassic Park. The book was obviously written as a film sequel. For one Ian dies in the original but he has been put back together for this novel. The explanation is poor. The T-Rex's now attack even if you don't move and the raptors are of superior intelligence compared to the ones in the original novel. It's a shame as parts of the book is quite exciting. I hope the movie is better
4,"Fun read, dosen't live up to the pre-quel.","Dosen't live up to the first novel.Only good for a fun read.Nice little story, not much to think about."
3,"See the Movie, Don't Read the Book","I barely got started with this book before I put it down. True, I did skim through it occasionally, and those parts were OK, but, if you want to know about the plot and storyline, see the movie. I read the original Jurassic Park, and it was much better written, much more interesting, and much, much more scarier"
1,Disappointment,"The action is so predictable that you can guess the end after afew chapters. The story isn't even interesting, even though the bookis well written. The worst is certainly the end, I felt cheated with such a cheap conclusion: Dinosaurs dying from the mad cow disease ! Mr. Crichton takes us for children ! A real disappointment, compared to the Jurassic Park."
1,What a disapointment,"Obviously, this book was written for money or a follow-upscreenplay of Jurassic Park. It's well written however, butMr. Crichton takes us for children: his theories are not realistic and the worst is that incredible ridiculous end. I adored Jurassic Park, but felt cheated when reading this book. Had the impression someone else than Crichton was the author!!"
2,Awful,"JP was mediocre, but this is awful. It is nothing but a dreadful screenplay for an idiotic movie. Both were a complete waste of time and money. This is a shame because both Mr. Crichton and Mr. Spielberg are capable of such genius"
1,Are You Kidding Me??!!,"I can't believe that the same literary genius who wrote Jurassic Park actually wrote this book! The passages were so long winded that I fell asleep twice while reading it. Crichton obviously tried to capatalize from the success of the first book and movie, but fell victim to the sequel jinx. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book.......unless you ran out of valium and are in need of a decent night's sleep."
3,Jurassic Park Part II,"There are many fine reviews already listed so I will be succinct. This book is a sequel to Jurassic Park. We join the cast of characters six years after the dinosaur island park disaster in which humans fought off genetically engineered replicas of prehistoric animals. One survivor of that attack is now a member of a group who returns to the area, another island called Site B, and meet up with the remaining dinosaurs. The book does have strong language and violence. Even though it fills like you are reading 'Jurassic Park' again, it is worth reading."
3,Let's go play with the dinosaurs again,"This is a followup to the highly popular JURASSIC PARK. Crichton knew a winning formula when he saw one and didn't deviate from the basic plot line. The story opens with a brief 'where are they now' update on the JP survivors, and resurrects Ian Malcolm, supposedly killed in the first novel. It is revealed that there was a site B, another island populated with dinosaur breeding stock. As in the first novel, there is a beautiful, brilliant woman scientist, a rugged great hunter, an obnoxious geek, a couple of cute kids, and assorted lesser characters and bad guys who fulfill their bits and then feed the dinosaurs.Even though this is a JURASSIC PARK lite, it's a fun read, a good book to take on a trip or to the beach - easy to follow, short, action filled chapters with subtle humor slipped in as well. And since this is by Crichton the reader just might discover that there is a little food for thought in there as well."
4,So much better than the movie!,"I absolutely HATED the movie THE LOST WORLD, especially the end. When a friend recommended I read the book, I was skeptical. But I just finished it, and he was right. Crichton always uses science to say something about the world--this book considers questions like man's destiny on Earth, etc. Very good."
1,"Great writer, Lousy book","One of the worst books ever written. Lacks continuity with the original Jurassic Park. Also lacks any form of insight or depth. Best thing about it is the title, stolen from Arthur Conan Doyle."
2,No good nor bad,"An easy reading book, semiserious scientific background. Sometimes characters seem to be stupid to give a reason to be eaten. Anyway, the original idea (Jurassic Park) was better than this second part. I expected have read a better book, but it is not so bad to be given only a star."
4,A great work in Hard SF.,"The Lost World continues where Jurassic Park leaves off. Ian Malcome (love his little speeches), and a few others discover a second island where most of the 'production' took place and they embark to make sure that this island is not swarming with dinosaurs now that the Jurassic Park is destroyed. Kudos for flawless science, but I'm gonna have to dock a star for style."
4,Why to buy,"Great MP3's. This will encode on its own. Plug the cable in to your headpone jack on your computer, CD player, ANYTHING with a hwadphone jack and it will record it as MP3. Even gameboy or your TV. This means stuff that streams on realplayer or WMP can be MP3.Windows XP sees it as a letter drive via USB so you can move files easily.USES BATTERIES fast when making MP3 though, 1-2 hours. Get rechargeables."
1,Not for those who arent electronic savy.,I had a rio 535s which I loved but I wanted more space. I bought this thinking it would be just as easy to use....sadly no. I have windows xp bussiness and it seems to fight witht the mps player. Addtionally you need to know more about everything each step of the way. If you have big hands this is not for you the buttons are tiny and hard to use. Maybe it is just me but this does not seem worth the money....
3,Walking the kid,"An electronics fan from Philly Cheesesteak, PA wrote ""This player rocks. I use it in the gym....walking the kid, etc""Walking the kid???Sad parenting if you need an MP3 player to ""walk your kid.""Sorry but this is no petsitting.Please, don't build silencing walls between you and your child.You would be well advised to discard your new toy and TALK to your kid for entertainment. Find toys BOTH of you will enjoy."
4,"Good, some errors though","I checked this book out at the library. I was happy to find a catholic ritual book for lay people which talked about celebrating the liturgical year at home as well as preparing for the sacraments before attending church. I have to say that I too noticed the colors the author listed for many of the days are incorrect. I think the author used green whenever she was unsure of the color. In the Roman Catholic Church the color green is used specificaly for ordinary time. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal states ""Green is used for Ordinary Time and on ferias, GIRM,no.308 c.Overlooking this mistake I think the book is an excelent resource for catholics who keep a home altar/shrine, and who wish to participate more fully in their faith."
1,This deserves a negative star review.,"Unfortunately, the author is guilty of blatant disregard for the one Tradition that is most precious to Catholics. And that is the Holy Mass. Just read her introduction and you'll see that she flagrantly dismisses the Latin Mass, the Mass of all ages. I was looking for a nice reference book to use in cultivating a rich and tradition-filled Catholic upbringing in my children; this clearly is not it."
2,It's good if you...,"are a new in the Cathoic church. She mixed up a couple things that it is not that important for the beggnning of your Catholic life and with God's grace you will learn along with the church.To me, totally in love with the church teachings and traditions, the book is missing a lot.I will give away to somebody who is lukewarn in his/her faith!"
4,Nice Flim,"James Cagney shines as a charming but corrupt rural politician trying to deceive the voters. Barbara Hale is great as his sweet wife who is clueless about how dishonest her husband really is. It isn't Cagney's best film, but it is entertaining, and the performances are excellent."
3,Unusual,Strange to watch an entire cast try to keep up a 'corn-pone' dialect throughout an entire film. Cagney seems stilted in this role but pulls it off. Classic film which always sells for pennies. Service was quick and efficient.
3,I guess it works,Not overly impressed but I guess in reality its does dim the loudness a bit. Seems to fit sorta loose on my 3/4 size violin.
4,Good,I like it but I like my rubber one a lot better. Easier to get on and in my mind it was better at mutingThis is my alternateGlaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute
3,"Maximum muting, but badly designed.","I tried few different mutes. This one provides maximum muting effect making playing barely audible. Perfect for playing without disturbing others. This being said there are 2 problems. The mute has its bridge grooves cut too tightly, and does not fit well on 2 of the bridges I tried it on - one being a cheap no-name, the other being Aubert Lux model. The mute goes only a few millimeters down and although works well, the fit is insecure and the weight shift may potentially damage bridge edges. I believe the mute could be improved by cutting the groves wider. The other problem is that the mute kills 99% of tonal color, so it's use is limited to practicing finger positions but not the actual clarity of played music. Since there are few manufacturers of this mute type, perhaps I need to try to obtain another one from a different vendor..."
5,Very Informative,I have read this book and there are things I didnt even know or have forgotten about my tribe. My father and uncles helped with the informatiion in this book about the Lower Brule Sioux........
1,I threw it in the trash this morning.,"For the first 2-3 months, I loved this pan. Good weight, good handle, even heat, non-stick. Used it with a light spray of oil and it was great. Was very careful -- used only plastic spatula, hand-washed with sponge or dobie. After a couple of months, eggs began to stick. I followed instruction manual and used green plastic scrubbing pad. It got worse and worse, as the non-stick coating began to wear off. For a while I continued to use it, with more oil. The coating continued to rub off. Today, after less than a year, I threw it out."
4,Good Buy,This is a great size pan. I like the weight and the size for many things other than omelettes. The only issue I have is that you can't use cooking spray on it and I use cooking spray all the time.
4,Easy,"I gave this as a gift to my mother, but I have used it several times and find it very satisfactory for small sautes other jobs that require a small quantity of fat. It is comfortable to use and easy to clean."
4,"Cooks evenly and well, lasts well.","This is my second Calphlon 10 inch omelet pan. The first lasted six years of daily use, with teens who forget about the prohibition of using metal utensils. Since they have grown and departed, this one should last forever."
4,A good story about a great adventure.,This e-book can be recommended for anyone interested in polar exploration adventures. You should also read the stories of Shackleton and Roald Amundsen. The errors Scott committed - particularly failure to train and prepare adequately (learing to ski for example) are lessons to all.
2,"The ""politically correct"" version of the journals","Lady Scott and others heavily edited the journals in order to remove all hints of incompetence, as well as the mean-spirited comments about his men, Shackleton, Amundson, and others. Beware that the source of this book appears to be the heavily edited printing, not the original journals."
2,Why not read the unexpurgated version?,"Why read this version, which has been heavily edited by multiple hands, when the original is now available, in the form of Huntford'sRace for the South Pole: The Expedition Diaries of Scott and Amundsen? Though I would suggest skipping Huntfords commentary and just reading the diaries, for the first reading at least. Like so many in this controversy, Huntford has become a zealot and a bit hard to take.BTW, there is a terrific amount of primary source Scott material on the net now, free for the taking, including the original SCOTT""S LAST EXPEDITION complete with nice period typesetting and original photos, no need to read third hand rehashes like this book."
4,Courage until the bitter end,"Whether these journals were edited or not is of small importance in the face of the challenge that these men attempted. Scarce few in this day could brave the monotony, much less the lack of conveniences and having to survive by their wits in an unforgiving environment. By the end, I felt as if I knew these men and I felt the loss as they weakened and succumbed to the ravages that nature wrought."
5,introducing my review,I've been a loyal shopper for quite sometime and my orders are always satisfactory. From movies to music they have door busting selections. In conclusion my name is Cameron and I approve this message.
3,HMMMMMMM.........,"These people seem to be on show. Except for Darwin Hobbs, he was HOT with ""HE's Able."" Could feel the spirit with that song. People like Tonex on this dvd, seems just to exalt self which is NOT what gospel is about ATALL"
5,understanding adhd,This was a wonderful book. It helped me understand ADHD better. It should be required reading for all teachers.
5,Outstanding resource for adults who interact with AD kids,"This book is easy, excellent reading for teachers, youth leaders and parents who come into contact with kids who have attentional or behavioral issues. The author makes no secret of his belief that medication is the first and most important step in treatment. Whether you agree with that or not, there is a wealth of information on recognizing the signs of the condition and on how to respond to and guide kids with these symptoms/behaviors. Take it heart and you'll minimize conflict and maximize accomplishment. The book is WELL worth the read. The title is accurate - I ended up with a feeling that I understand the kids I interact with much better than I did before."
4,Managing operational risk,"It is a comprehensive book that emphasize on the strategies to manage operational risk. The examples quoted in this book are quite recent and relevant. However, the arrangement of pages in this ebook was not done properly, some titles appeared to be at the bottom of the page. Nevertheless it is a good read for those who wish to enhance further on his risk mitigation approaches."
5,This is a must have read for risk practioneers,I have worked and studied operational risk for years and find it an excellent reference to best practice.
1,Bedtime stories in OR,"Do you like key risk indicators? A good one for 'book purchase' is to see the number of people reselling it, trying to cover the loss of buying a bad book or a book they do not need anymore. In this particular case, this book was released like two months ago and the number of people already reselling it in the secondary market is very high. For example, today 6 readers are selling this book. I believe this tells more than anything else. Buy at your own risk!"
1,Tips Over,"I bought this pot a few years back and hopefully that particular model isn't made anymore. It's a complete safety hazard as the handle is too heavy for the body of the pot and causes it to tip over. The one I have is a 2-qt saucepan with a handle that looks ""sculpted""... not a smooth regular shape... and the base is a separate plate welded onto the bottom. You have to put quite a bit into the pot before it becomes stable enough to use, ie. heating a few T of oil to start a dish is just outright dangerous. It should have been recalled in sizes smaller than 3 qts. I have Calphalon Tri-Ply for my other pots and they are superb so I have nothing against the brand, just this one pot."
2,Not as good as I hoped,I bought this burner one year and two weeks ago. The bad news to me is it's a one year warrenty and the drive just went bad two days ago. The year I had it I probably burned about 100 good discs and 30 bad ones. Sometimes It worked great and other times I fought with it. A year ago I paid $130 for it and expected it to last a whole lot longer than it did. Now I have to look for a replacement. If you buy this burner I would suggest an extended warrenty to cover yourself. Good Luck !
2,SONY's star is sinking,"I bought this product based on SONY's reputation, and first I was quite pleased. But after 4 month it was not able to burn any CD anymore. And this is similar to other SONY products I bought (DVD player etc). SONY, do something to increase the quality of your products. Until this is done, I go for other brands."
1,"Do not buy, bad quality, bad service","Sony has pretty good reputation for consumer products, but this drive has been bad news! The first drive was dead on arrival. The second drive died a month later only after burning 10 CD-Rs and less than 5 DVD-Rs.Try getting an RMA...I had to deal with the support center for 3 days, first to get told to run a drive check utility, wait 24 hours for them to process, then try to get an RMA. THATS 3 days just to get an RMA!!!! Oh! The best part is they wanted another drive check with a firmware upgrade to 2.1c from 2.1a, that's another 24 hours.All said, I have spent over 3 months without really using this drive given the time it had to ship UPS ground!If you value your time...stay away from this deal."
2,Bad support problem if you own a sony dvd player,I bought this and upgrade to the 8x and was happy until I tried to play this a dvd-r on my home system that plays other dvd-r just fine. It seems that the sony dvd-r is a little diffrent then others. I have 2 other slower burners and the dvd-r that they burn can be played in my sony dvd changer but if I burn it with my sony burn and can not be read. Sony said that itis not there problem because it can be read on the burner itself. Poor very poor
3,Incompatibile with AOL,"The included software, RecordNow, has some problems to work with AOL. I have several DVD+R discs damaged when these conditions are all true:1. AOL is connected2. RecordNow is burning DVD.3. Using Laptop and the Windows ""Close the lid of my laptop computer"" option is set to ""None"".4. Close the lid.This problem is definitely repeatbale."
3,"its good, but it dosnt measure up","wile this game is enjoyable and pretty well made, it dosnt measure up to some of the other D&D; CRPG's out there such as bauldurs gate (1, but especially 2), and icewind dale. nor does it measure up to the other games made by troika( arcanum, one of my favirot games; and VM: the bloodlines). in short it is fun, but not outstanding. if your a hardcore D&D; or western RPG gamer id recommend it otherwise, i would probably skip it.peace out, and long live PC gaming-hobbes mcgoo"
3,"Great for the fans, ok for everyone else","Being the only game released that uses the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition rule set, there is not much to compare this game with. However if you are a fan of those rules, this game is pretty spot on following them. This is based on an original AD&D module, and I think the developers did a great job modifying it for the new edition. It does have problems with bugs, but many of these can be fixed with a patch. I only wish more modules were converted into this form. This is definitely for people familiar with the Pen and Paper Dungeons and Dragons. The story is fairly simple and it has many bugs, but if its nostalgia you are looking for in an updated form, this is definitely for you."
3,ToEE review,"This was an extremely engaging game, requiring strategy and follow through.All in all, 9 out of 10."
3,"Ummm, Lenny has done better","OK, I'm a big Lenny Henry mark, but, I was a little disappointed by this tape. I remember seeing the show when it was broadcast and it seems that they left out a lot of really funny things. It is a tragedy that soul singer Theopolus P. Wildebeast shows up for only 30 seconds. Still, no one is better at send ups of both Michael Jackson and Prince and the ongoing episode of ""The Jewel in the Passage of India"" is pretty funny stuff. Lenny stand up is a little dated now, however."
1,The Best? This is the best? I'd hate to see the worst,"If this is humor, I am truly fearful for modern civilization. Need I say more."
1,weak,"Complete waste of $350. Motor failed after 2000 nails. Don't buy a dewalt cordless nailer. Many problems still exist with Dewalts design as of July 2008. My 15 ga nailer has problems as well -- doesn't advance the nails. I have to manually advance the nails. Plenty of jambs with the 15 and 16. Look at the Dewalt website. It's impossible to contact the company. Your left high and dry after the tools fail. Call the local repair dealer and they tell you they can fix the tool for the price of a new one. Get a ""cumbersome"" pneumatic nailer - at least they work."
5,dewalt 18v finish nailer,"Nice nail gun to use. Yes it's a little heavy, but it is so fast to take in a home and use. You don't have a hose or compressor. And for me it is easier to use this gun, than to nail it by hand. The led light was a nice touch in a dark closest that I was working in."
3,cordless nailer,"does the job, but bulky. too clumsy of a unit for the price. better than lugging a compressor and air nailer is only advantage."
4,"At last, free of hoses.....","A must for base, crown, casing, etc. Have not been able to run down a battery yet, but I'm not a production finish guy. Nails shoot straight every time. Accurate depth adjustment. Accepts DeWalt & Paslode brads. Nice trigger operated ""headlight"" feature for darker areas. Integrated belt hook another nice feature. Selectable one-at-a-time or sequential ""bump"" modes. Naturally heavier than traditional air-operated nailers, but alot lighter than carrying my pancake compressor & hose from room to room. Not for tight places, so hold on to your pin nailer."
5,You want me on that wall! You need me on that wall!,"I'm a DIYer who has replaced my baseboards in my house and this nailer has been invaluable. Initially, I was doing things by hand which meant drilling a pilot hole through the baseboard and the wall, hammering in a nail, and using my nailset to sink the nail. What a pain!After putting a few baseboards in that way, I decided that was ridiculous and got the Dewalt nailer. Now it's a simple 1-step, 1-hand process that speeds things up by a factor of 10. My other hand is free to help position the board exactly where I want it, the nail holes are smaller and easier to fill, and the battery lasts forever as far as I'm concerned. For DIY tasks, this nailer works perfectly and is much more convenient than having to deal with pneumatic compression or Paslode gas cartridges."
5,Worth every penny!,"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread. No more lugging around a compressor and hose. We have done two rooms of crown molding and the battery shows no sign of slowing down. It has a power setting that allows you to find the sweet spot for the wood you are working with. We had now issues driving 2.5in nails. The unit is big compared to an air version but never was an issue in corners. Heavy?? A little, but my wife had no problems nailing up our crown molding. I recommend this nailer to everyone."
3,"Hit and Miss, be prepared.","There are quite a few good comics in here. David Heatley's sexual history is one of the best comics I have ever read. But, be prepared for A LOT of stuff, that is not only barely definable as a comic, but also nearly impossible to read or even look at. It's actually physically painful to the eye. That being said, the few good stories here are excellent."
5,Yay comics!,"Easily one of the finest comics anthologies in the world right now, and this issue is a treat! If you're at all familiar with the many contributors, you'll know what you're in for (only this time, almost everything's in full colour!). If you're not, but you're into alternative comix, or want to sample some of the most interesting stuff happening at the fringes of contemporary art and/or literature, then give it a try. [...]"
3,Fill these Pages Please,"This book could be reduced to one half or one third pages. The '115 great tasting' wines part of this book is essentially a repetition of the same basic formula over and over with only a few wines with some variation from one to the next. Basic operations are described, but I was hoping for a bit more of fine pointers. It is a good starter basic book. But save a few trees and streamline at the risk of looking like there is no content, or add some."
3,For Grape Growers,"This is a book from my Christmas List and is great if you want recipes on how to convert all your grapes in to wine. However, if you are looking for a book that provides you with technical information about wine making, and a substantial number of country wines, you may need to look elsewhere. It was hard to review because although it has a great selection of grape recipes, it lacks the detail I was looking for on how to make wine, and develop wine recipes from scratch, unless I missed it."
4,my review,a very good book to start with. has many traditional wines. all in different catagories according to the grape. i used the peach and white grape recipe for my first try. everyone absolutley loves it.
4,Christmas Present,I bought for a Christmas present. The person it was for is just beginning to do wine making. He really enjoys making different kinds from the grapes he grows.
3,A good start,"A good start for the novice wine maker. After reading I decided would let wine making be left to the pros. Better to spend $15-$50 on a good bottle of wine then make my own plunk for probably more in the long run.JP Saleeby, MDco-founder of Savannah Wine Club"
2,A good idea a poor outcome,I bought this charger having lost my verizon charger thinking that it was a great deal for the price. It certainly was a great price but the outcome has been less than possitive. I have to shake the charger for a few minutes until it begins to charge the phone. After that I have to place it down very carefully lest it stop charging. Then sometimes it startes and stopes charging randomly for a while... it is very annoiying.
1,be careful..........Despite,"despite it claims it DID NOT FIT MY JET dedicated mortiser. The max. shank sixe is 1/2"", they need a turned down shank (not 5/8"") for the cjisel and drill to fit. Construction and sharpness however seemed to be excellent as CMT usually is."
5,Miraculous Saucepot!,"I used this saucepan 3 times the first day it arrived! NOTHING stuck to it and cleaning it was a snap! If you need a medium size saucepot, this commercial nonstick is the way to go. You can't go wrong with this one!"
5,I love all my Calphalon products,"These are the best nonstick. I've used this pot so much but finally, as with all nonstick, it wears out. But I would totally recommend getting one. But remember a nonstick stock pot has to be treated carefully."
1,"Might be good, if it was not damaged","We ordered it from Amazon and the pot was severely ovel (not round) which makes it tough to use. And of course Amazon's dodgy return policy and inability to replace a product that is defective.So buyer beware. The price is great, the customer service around here is a little suspect."
4,Jump Into Education by Playing,"In tradition with it's previous grade Jumpstart Advanced bundles, this 5th grade package offers the lure of ""gaming"" while teaching essential skills. Through investigations in rare art, geography, and math as well as history and science, the fifth grade student must acquire the clues necessary to solve a mystery in order to ""beat the game"". The games are up to date with fifth grade interest in some areas, offering virtual skateboarding and other treats to keep the mind tempted. The only trouble I ran into while running the program at my home Daycare was the occasional program glitch concerning math answers; the right answer would not be accepted by the program and would result in a stalemate between user and PC. Other than that, a purchase well worth the money!"
1,Look Out if you are a Mac user!!,"Very unhappy with this software product. It will not install onto a Mac G4 Power book using OSX. When contacting ""Knowledge Adventure"" tech support they stated that they were aware of the problem about installation with some Macs but said there was no way to fix the problem and I should return it for a refund. However, as I learned with this bad purchase software is usually not returnable once opened."
2,Not Much Luck With This Scanner,"After my old scanner died I read some reviews on scanners, and read that the previous Epson model was good. I went to CompUSA to pick it up, but was told that model was discontinued and here were the new models. Hoping that the current model would be just as good I bought the V100 scanner. My first V100 worked up until I did a few negative strips, and then I got this jack hammer sound and the scans were leaving some parts of the photo off, or stretching the photos. Disappointed I exchanged the scanner for a new V100. I used it for a few days with no problems, and thought all was good. About 3 months later I started to do some more scans and then the jack hammer started again with the same poor scan results. Now the store won't let me return the item for a new one so I'm stuck with a terrible scanner. I will give it 2 stars since the scans were good when it was working. My recommendation is to look at other scanners."
3,Get an HP scanner!,"I've always use an HP scanner before and I've always been pleased. I only buy a non HP scanner because I read reviews that Epson scanners are good, too. This scanner is not worth the money I paid and it sits collecting dust. When scanning, the scanner scans very slowly. It scans for about 1/3 of the page and then it stops for some reason, then it continues for another 1/3 and then stop and again scans the rest of the page. The HP scanners that I have before, it scans ONCE smoothly without stopping and I get an image within seconds, not minutes like this Epson scanner."
1,The Epson V100 Pure Frustration,I have owned dozens of Epson products and two previous Epson scanners. They have all performed reliably. When my last trusty scanner started to show its age I figured the V100 would be a great replacement. Instead I feel thoroughly cheated by Epson. It has major trouble being properly recognized by the Twain drivers and instead prefers to go into some sort of hardware coma - blinking red or green light mode indefinitely. Repowering or reinitializing generally does not fix the problem. Sometimes a reboot will. Then if it does scan it has another problem where it starts to grind and click and the scans are smeared. When it does scan yes they are great scans.Epson's support is lousy. There is no acknowledgment of these faults on their website. They do not reply to emails. Phone support steps you through the usual routines. The only option I'm given after a month is to take it to a repair center.
1,THIS SCANNER IS PURE GARBAGE!,"This scanner does not live up to it's ""Perfection"" name. I bought this scanner because I needed to quickly scan several documents and images for a project. So I figured this scanner would be good at least since it carried the EPSON name. Warning to all Mac Graphic Designers, if you buy this scanner, you will be sorry! This scanner works only 30% of the time. Every time I click on the scanner icon, it claims that it cannot locate the scanner but it is clearly hooked up! So I have to unplug all of the cords for like 5 seconds then plug back again in order for the scanner to work. Crappy. Plus the interface is just ugh- hideous! Such a waste of my $99 plus tax dollars. I am planning on buying a better scanner very soon."
1,Worst piece of electronics in my house,"Don't make the same mistake I did and spend $100+ on this piece of garbage. Or even $50. In fact, I wouldn't waste another penny on this. I've been up for the past two hours focusing on scanning something I need. I downloaded the drivers, I looked at the manual, and have reached the conclusion that after 30 days this thing DOES.NOT.WORK. The few times it did work for me, it was good. But not ""$125"" good. Or ""hours of my time"" good. Or ""not being frustrated"" good."
5,Excellent Sleeping Beauty,"Tchaikovsky's three ballets are my three favorite classical compositions of all time. Previn does an excellent job with Sleeping Beauty (Op. 66). The highlights are Scene 1, Scene 5, Scene 20, Scene 21, and of course, the finale. The sound is loud, strong, and emotional.The only problem is that in the booklet, the scenes are labeled incorrectly and that the scenes are not divided up as they usually are, so some of the tracks are really long."
2,not their best skits,"I am sorry to say that I did not care much for this compilation. But that doesn't mean that you won't like it. My dad taped an episode of the show many years ago, which together with this tape, is my only exposure to the show. That episode was non-stop laughs. This tape is much longer with many more skits (none of the same ones I had already seen) but to me, they're just not as funny."
2,Not great,"It helps but it's not a great solution. I'm in a wheelchair and I can no longer manage the transfer to the wash basin chair when I have my hair shampooed in a hairdressing salon. Brought the shampoo tray along with me and it was ackward in two respects. It was pretty much impossible to slope the tray from my shoulders down to the level of the wash basin without creating a large gap at the neck. Instead, I had to slide forward in the wheelchair to create a more level surface. Also, because the tray surface is very flat without any ""trough"", it was very easy for water to run over the sides."
4,"Tray is great, but.....","Our daughter is very disabled. I bought this tray, hoping it would work. It will, but there's a problem. The ads on Amazon don't make it clear, seems to me, that a spray hose comes with the tray. Problem was the spray wouldn't fit on our faucets. Now, I'm looking for one that will. I repeat: that tray's really special--must've been invented by someone with a similar problem."
2,Too small,If you are using this for a person with a large neck forget it. It is not adjustable and you'll end up getting water all over the place and/or squeezing a person's neck to the point of pain.
1,Awful!!,"Unless you are a child, the neck opening won't fit the smallest adult. I should have followed the reviews and not purchased this thing. It was a waste of my time and the only one who made money on it was the shipping company."
4,EZ shampoo hair tray,It works pretty good for my Mom who is in a wheelchair following a stroke. We manage to wash her hair this way ... I wish it had more of a rubbber seal around the neck as it doesn't fit and we have to use lots of towels ... but it's okay.
4,It works,I have a few customers that are confined to wheelchairs and this item has made it possible for them to continue to have there hair done.
4,"better on the radio, but worth reading for the gems","Some of the essays are lightweight -- e.g. about the meaning of making an audio tape compilation for someone. Some are deeper, about things like father-daughter relationships. The sudden change from one flavor of essay to another can be jarring, but the essays don't suffer for that, just the book as a whole. Some are combinations, like ""Music Lessons"", about ""lessons accidentally learned while pursuing music."" The pieces are probably best suited to radio, one at a time during a commute. In book form, they don't achieve full potential. You're not forced to read them in quick succession, but the book format pulls you to do so, and the points that make you laugh and nod are forgotten too quickly. A few of these essays (New Jersey, Chicago and Frank Sinatra) feel like too many words saying too little. But there are some gems of observation."
3,Fairly Decent,"Take the Cannoli serves as a decent introduction to Sarah Vowell's writing, although it is not nearly as good as Partly Cloudy Patriot. The most appealing thing about her is the simple fact that one can disagree with her opinions without feeling argumentative. She has a way of presenting her opinions that does an excellent job of articulating why she feels the way she does without sounding like she is attacking any opposing opinion. Very civilized and enjoyable."
4,A great read!,"I first heard Sarah Vowell on ""This American Life"" on the radio. As she read her piece on the Goth scene in San Francisco, I remember thinking, ""This MUST be public radio, because a voice like that would never cut it at a corporate super station."" To call her voice squeaky is a disservice to rubber ducks and old floors alike. Her ability to capture life in America and put it into words is extraordinary. While her politics are so far to the left that I found myself grimacing in certain parts, her wit and deadpan (yes- deadpanning the written word!) delivery more than make up for her misguided ideals."
4,"Humorous essays from NPR's ""This American Life"" commentator","The best pieces are hilariously funny and touching, while others are strident and obsessive. My favorites are about insomnia, a goth makeover, rock 'n' roll fantasy camp, learning to drive, making custom music tapes, and the high school band experience."
2,"Take the cannoli, leave the book on the shelf","This book is weak. Ms. Vowell is a pleasure to listen to on the radio...somehow her wit and timing don't translate well into the printed word.The book is somewhat redeemed by the inclusion of a well written treatise on the ""Trail of Tears"" tragedy."
4,No complaint,Gave this book as a gift so I don't know the quality of the pages. Cover looked taken care of and it arrived on time.
3,A clever and witty delivery of truth.,"Vowell's book is definately a clever and witty delivery of truth. Some of it is her own truth through life experience. Even if you don't share her opinions, you understand her point without feeling like you are sacrificing your own. She makes you think, laugh and enjoy yourself with introspection mixed in..well done Vowell!"
4,Hooray for Sarah the Smartaleck,"In one of the pieces in this very funny book, Sarah compares herself to Mr. Spock: a severely objective being stranded on an absurdly emotional planet. This is the source of her comedy. She just can't believe her eyes when confronted by a ""rock and roll dream camp"" populated entirely by has-beens. She just knows that every television news program in existence will play ""My Way"" after Sinatra dies. Vowell sees through everything and still retains her love for America, even at its silliest."
4,Like a lively conversation at a bistro,"...and speaking of a bistro, her take on the hidden meaning of your morning mocha is laugh-out-loud funny. This collection of essays deals with her historical, political, religious, and cultural experiences - and who could be more fun to wade through that with than a cynical, lyrical gen-X commentator?!This book has a little something for everyone. Well, O.K., probably not everyone. If you're a big fan of the Left Behind series, you might not like her take on premillenial dispensationalism. If you have little appreciation for Frank Sinatra, you may need to skip a couple of the essays. It reads like a lively road-trip passenger, full of random opinions and witticisms. Having heard her recently in a live reading, I think we would be well served by an audio version of this book."
2,Not so hot,I wanted to like this book ... but found it to be a somewhat boring rant. More entertaining on radio then on the page. Stick to broadcasting.
2,Take the cannoli and go somewhere else.,What works for Ira Glass doesn't work for Vowell.This book is excruciating.
1,Ho-hum.,"The New York Times review of this book pretty neatly captures the essential weakness of this type of writing, endemic to both public radio and, worse, online magazines like Salon. (...)"
4,I LOVED THIS BOOK...,"...but I will caution readers that they MIGHT find it more enjoyable to hear Consigliere Sarah Vowell read them herself. That's what I discovered. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic book start to finish; my favorite This American Life essayist covers a wide and diverse variety of topics, from the Trail of Tears to growing up a gunsmith's daughter to going Goth for a day. Every essay in this book was a delectable morsel of Sarah Vowell's acid, accurate wit. This wonderful piece of insight made me laugh, made me think, and most of all, made me understand why I should leave the gun and take the cannoli. Thank you, Sarah Vowell, for continuing to grace the world of popular culture with your fresh, cutting perspective."
5,Hilarious,"Sarah Vowell is a wonderful commentary as well as essayist. I am a huge fan of NPR. I enjoy David Sedaris, Ira Glass and Sarah. I have read several of David's books but simply cannot compare these two broadcastors. Both are wonderful to listen to on the radio but I'm sorry, Sarah Vowell is by far, the better writer. Her book was so, so enjoyable. I laughed out loud so many times reading it. Her foray into the Goth culture had me in stitches. I related so well because I wanted my daughter to become a ""goth"" while she was in high school. She just rolled her eyes at me...anyway, I thought I was one of the few adults who appreciated the goth look. Sarah, you made me smile. Thanks so much. I just love your take on life...Keep it up."
4,Intelligent Observations,"These stories of odd occurences, self development and intelligent observations of the world around Ms. Vowell are a pleasure to read. She writes in such a way that each story is as entertaining as it is educational. Each story pulls you along unwittingly toward a moral, whether it be the sanctity of mix tapes, American history or ""Species-on-Species Abuse"". She writes for more than just a punch-line, which isn't to say there weren't times I laughed out loud (e.g. Rick Derringer promoting clean guitars). A good book to take with you if you're traveling and need short stories that can stand alone.Bonus: There are 5 illustrations in this book by the talented Tony Millionaire, creator of the Maakies comic. What a treat."
4,Some very funny essays but...,I picked up Take the Cannoli after Sarah's appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman when the book first came out in hard cover. I found most of the essays to be very funny but the work about the Cherokee Indians was kind of depressing after laughing out loud to while reading the book.
1,"On the radio great, on the page not","something happens when ""literature"" written for the radion and mass consumption is trascribed and presented as literature. it loses all literary effect. she's great to listen to on the radio--the voice, the music, etc--but on the page the stuff is weak as heck. the ""observations"" cliche, and the humor that once was uproarious on the radio is simply nonexistent."
3,Take the Cannoli,"She's a staple of This American Life on Public Radio International, and she's also appeared in GQ, Salon and Request. Her humor and wit are sharp and perceptive. But, let me work from the back cover blurbs.Essays on American history, pop culture and her own family. Yep. But it's not easy to get me interested in American history or pop culture. A madonna of Americana. Yep, but I'm bored again.Her writing about her family, early on, was great. Then we got some history that bored me, but I kept going because she is talented. Surface, but talented. Then an essay about the Trail of Tears that really hit home for me, then some amusing stuff. It's not bad, but I don't see myself going back for seconds. I'll keep an eye on whatever else she does."
5,WOW,another fantasic pan ! i have nearly the whole set now ..& love cooking with them...so easy to wash up too & will last a life time!! highly recommend!
1,Booooooooooooooooring!!!!!!!,"Total waste of money. I normally like ms Johansen's books, this was a waste of time as well as money, I was just skippig pages so that I could get though it - never did"
1,Worthless,"This product is worthless. It's not for retail sales, since it only matches a certain type of computer network operation, which isn't disclosed. It's marketed with a CD, but it doesn't have one, so Symantec will conveniently make it obsolete if your computer crashes, i.e., buy a new version.Symantec installation support for this entire line of products is terrible. My techie agreed to 5-6 hours of installation time, and he's already gone way overboard. They won't answer phone calls unless you pay them, even to get the product on your computer. They take days to respond to emails.This is why I'm getting away from Symantec offerings, including Norton. The company is awful. Symantec personnel and products are anti-consumer."
4,Covers a lot of Ground,"I feel like I really got my money's worth on this cd. This band covers so much ground that to listen to just one track would not give you a true representation of their sound. It never gets boring, these guys use elements of black metal, death metal, industrial, classical music, and other stuff I can't ever put a name to. Whenever I put it on, I have to listen to the whole thing to conclusion. I only gave it 4 stars however, because this type of band can sometimes be accused of being unfocused and unsure of the direction they want to go. But they're just so good at everything, I don't care. The vocalist can do high, screeching black metal, gutteral death metal, and can even do clean singing fairly well. Best way to describe this disc: it sounds like you have a 6 cd changer shuffling Dying Fetus, Dark Funeral, Rush, some new age cd, a classical disc, and an industial band at random."
2,"Great Toy, Poor Craftsmanship",I bought this for my son to help him strengthen his hand and improve his fine motor skills. This pen would be perfect for that purpose if the quality was not so poor. It works about half the time and that's only if you bang it to get the battery connection to move to the right place and turn the pen on. I would not recommend this cheap version of a very useful toy.
3,Most of them worked.....,"I bought 7 of these pens for my grandson's kindergarten class. When the teacher put the batteries in them, one of the pens was defective. Since she didn't do this for a few weeks, and then school was closed for the holidays etc., the date for returns has passed. Many people complained about the poor quality, I hope the rest of the pens will last the school year, and that Amazon could donate the defective on to the classroom."
3,"Fun, switch sticks","I bought this for my special needs child after he enjoyed using one in therapy sessions. It IS fun to use, but I can only give 3 stars, because the switch is hard to engage and sometime it keeps slipping into the ""off"" position, which is frustrating,"
5,REVEALING BEST-KEPT SECRETS,"This amazing, well-written book explores a subject that has for too long been overlooked: the multidimensional ways in which food influences all aspects of our health. From optimal eating strategies and the food-mood connection to imbuing food with spiritual meaning and social satisfaction--this pioneering book covers it all.Author Deborah Kesten is a groundbreaking thinker who shares the latest evidence that builds a bridge between ancient food wisdom and modern, Western nutritional science. The end result: a bold new vision of the role of food and nutrition in our everyday life; a book that lays the foundation for a genuine East/West integration for both what and how to eat for optimal health."
5,Blends issues of food and healing with a spiritual approach,"Blend issues of food and healing with a spiritual approach to nutrition and health and you have Healing Secrets Of Food, a treatise which provides both a history of food in various cultures and religions and a survey of Western nutritional science. Chapters probe the importance of food in healing various ailments."
4,Good pan,The lid is great! The pan is just a little thin (light) But it wasn't $200 like a lot of the heavier pans I looked at... You get what you pay for.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY-$$$$$$$$$,"If 1 page is all there is to earn my $5.95 - I want my money back!!!!Some common sense points are made in this article, But hardly worth 5.95At least give me the Fleet Equipment Magazine to read.There must be something amiss here???????? Help!!!!"
2,Basic Human Microbiology,"Dear Amazon Review Board,After reading through the textbook of Microbiology: A Human Perspective, I thought that the authors, for the most part, all came from Washington State University which may have not been the best choice for a diverse approach into the medical microb perspective. The text book appears to have been written toward the junior or early high school level. I was looking for a more detailed text book that would be geared toward the professional in the medical arena. Therefore, I gave the text book to a family friend who is entering the 10th grade and loves to read all about micro organisms.Dr. Gary D. Goldberg, PhDClinical Professor of Medical Education at ACNProfessional Medical Writer for Times Publishing Co."
2,So So,I usually enjoy UK politcal anything but this was just not that good so I have decided not to buy anymore of them.
3,"Slightly outdated, and one sided.","This book was published well over 30 years ago by a man who was a former evolutionist.You can already tell that the book is one sided, but it is still an entertaining read for creationists and evolutionists. For the creationist, it may strengthen your faith, and for the evolutionist, it may get you to thinking.You can't really rate the content, because most of it is cited, and I don't feel like going through each individual chapter and pointing out the pros and cons.I kind of didn't like how Wysong stated that Theistic evolution was a fallacy, even though I am a Christian and I have no trouble accepting evolution. I think that Christians should not reject science but embrace it. But hey, that's just me."
1,one star just for laughs!!!!,"This is a total joke from the first page to the last. Filled with utter rubbish and infact downright lies. Like another reviewer i often felt insulted by the desperate creationist falsification of the truth. Only ignorant, unitelligent individuals could possibly believe any of this B.S."
5,Great product and service,"I have been using this product and putting it in the dishwasher for over a year and still love the product. Calphalon Stainless steel products can go in the dishwasher and the warranty is not voided. I read another review that said otherwise, but that is false. Everyone should try this product, I love it!"
3,Christmas Gift,I ordered this product as a Christmas gift and paid for the two day delivery. I am very upset with DHL they fouled up and took four days to deliver my package allthough it was in town on time. They admitted the late delivery was thier fault but since it was the holidays they refused a refund of the shipping charge. The product is great and I'm very happy with the retailer and the product. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH DHL OR WITH ANY RETAILER THAT USES THEM.
4,Subversions,"This is techno for listening: in other words, it's musical. The omnipresent Latin-derived 4/4 metronome is used as just another element of rhythm on some tracks, and doesn't appear at all on others; the consistency lies in a sometimes-subversion of the ""traditional"" format, and a general attention given to layering and texture. Gemini's ""Crossing Mars"" may be the most striking example, as the predicted beat is interwoven with constantly-shifting elements over a space of several minutes - building a dramatic sense of aural architecture - until a peculiar atonal riff is dropped into the mix; that riff is then treated to a similar process of deconstruction. Predictably, a couple of tracks (by Flexitone and 4th Wave) are not differentiated enough from the general mass of dance music, despite their quirky textures, and given the fact that together these tracks take up 11 minutes of the program, I can't give the CD the five stars that some of the other tracks alone deserve."
4,Useful Anchors,"If you need to anchor many things, this is a relatively good buy. It is important to note that it just comes with the anchors. Unlike some packs, there are no screws. For the most part, this has not been a problem: I (and I infer most people)anchor things that come with their own screws and cheapo anchors."
1,Not for books on tape,"I listen to a lot of books on tape and with the rise of books on CD I thought I'd enter the modern era by getting an MP3 player. I picked the YP-35H. Big mistake. It turns out that when you drag and drop files on to the device, there is no guarantee that the track/files will go on in the order you expect. For music, it probably isn't that big a deal. For books, it's unacceptable."
1,Worst software ever,I would never buy a Samsung product. The RIO software is a horrible joke except nobody is laughing.
2,"So, what does make them winners?","Not sure that the title or subtitle of this book has anything to do with whats written inside. Instead, it each chapter begins with a listing of playoff teams who were good or bad in a particular obscure statistical area, and then goes on ad nauseaum about certain players on those teams, with no real synthesis or conclusion about what makes teams win. As a Tiger fan, I enjoyed reading about Chet Lemon, Darrell Evans, and Willie Hernandez. However, if I was an aspiring GM, looking for advice on how to build my team into a winner, this book would not help much (which is what it purports to try to do)."
1,If there's a point here I couldn't find it,"From the title, the tagline and the blurb, I expected the author to be putting forward a new, more revealing, way to assess performance and/or a unique insight into what factors on a team produces winners. You know, something that took a rational shot at tired old ways and proposed a new approach, a la ""Money Ball"". Something that might have applicability beyond baseball...Instead it's paragraph after paragraph of rambling anecdotes that I suppose are intended to support some point. But the points are never stated. However the does manage to garnish his aimless prose liberally with gratuitous little non sequiturs and self-important cleverisms that draw attention to the author. But I guess that's because he has nothing really to say.Don't waste your money."
3,"Good, but weighed down","""Winners"" is a pretty lively read. Dayn Perry discusses how playoff teams (excluding the strike-shorted 1981 season and the 1994 season where there were no playoffs) reached the playoffs. Were they starting pitching-rich? Did they have good hitters? A top-notch bullpen? A combination of all three? Perry breaks down how each team did it.What weighs the book down are a couple things. First, the book is far too wordy. It's as if Perry wanted the reader to know how smart he was by using as many big words as possible. Second, he veers off topic at times by giving mini-bios of certain players. While some of them are interesting, others are irrelevant. For instance, what does John Rocker's 1999 Sports Illustrated interview or Pedro Guerrero's drug arrest have to do with builiding a winning team? While I appreciate Perry's attempt to spice up the text, some of it doesn't add anything to the book.Overall this is a good, quick read. Mildly recommended."
4,Another good read by Box,"I started the Picket novels on recommendation from Amazon after buying the Alex McNight series by Steve Hamilton. Both book series are easy reads that will draw you in before you know it. They are slightly incredible in storyline over the series (as are most series books -after all, how many exciting things can happen to the same person over and over), but still enjoyable. Not as complex as someone like Ludlum, but very enjoyable for a tired mind after a busy week of work.If you like these, try The McNight books by Steve Hamilton."
2,From thriller to agitprop,"The first two Joe Pickett novels were wonderful thrillers. I felt like I had entered the wilds of Wyoming. The protagonist was and remains an everyman who simply tries to do the right thing-from citing the Governor to clashing with the local powers that be-including the Sheriff and some criminal deputies. The Pickett family characters remain superbly drawn. The crisis with foster daughter April is gripping. Unfortunately, the author has now created caricature villains. The central evildoers, rogue federal employee Melissa Strickland and her FBI ""enforcers"" are simply not credible. The characters are overdrawn. The novel moves from thriller to anti-federal government propaganda piece.I was disappointed and do not highly recommend this Pickett outing."
3,Getting Too Political/Right Wing,"I have read all 3 of Box's novels. He writes well and in general the stories and characters are interesting. But, each book has progressed a little further in ithe apparent aim to fault government in general and environmental agencies in particular. Winterkill is almost cartoonish in this regard. Clearly, with any form of regulation, there are problems. But, it's hard to believe that all Federal employees in the west are bad guys bent on making the poor locals lives miserable. Box really gets carried away in Winterkill and it damages the credibility of his story. I was hoping for a series that brought good stories founded on the inevitable conflicts of environmental issues but I am losing hope."
5,Riveting.,"Couldn't put it down. I stay cold throughout the book. Box made the setting ""real"". Easy read. Great writer. Read the series in order."
3,An Okay Addition to the Series,"On the whole I'm a fan of the Joe Pickett stories and classify them as solid 4 rated offerings, a rung below the best mysteries out there. Having said that, this one isn't one of the best. In this one Joe's ""adopted"" daughter is kidnapped by her birth mother and held in a remote compound by a group of radical anti-government/authority types like those made famous at Ruby Ridge. We all know that there are people out there with those type of leanings, but for me the whole story got to be too unreal, and I guess just plain uninteresting. For me this was a strikeout in a series that has been mostly doubles."
2,Winterkill,For my taste this story has excess violence which adds little. Mr. Box's stories put children and animals in mortal danger which puts me off. I think he watches a little too much MacGyver if he thinks you can remove a steering wheel with a Leatherman tool; you need a big wrench and a puller since they are pressed on. A gas explosion due to a leak out side is also not too plausible. I also think that the law enforcement personal portrayal was not very accurate. Sure you can have a few bad apples but in this story most of them were not professional and in this day and age would not get away with some of their actions. I also think that our hero Joe Pickett's character has been damaged. The local is good and the writing is good and I did finish the book but I read to escape but this is not a place I want to be.
1,Grim and Full of Animal Cruelty,"This is the first C.J. Box novel I have started to read (threw it away after p.59) and it will be the very last that I buy. The writing was poor, there was no plausible story line and the author resorted to grim and gory animal cruelty. Don't waste your money on this book!"
1,Winterkill,"I am a avid reader,but as a senior with a fixed income I can only afford to buy paperback books, this book like many I want to read have to small of print to read comfortable. They are losing out on a lot of sales just to save printing a few more pages."
1,I have not received this book due to none of the sellers having it at the time of my order.,"I placed an order for this book twice and none of the sellers had it on hand to ship, therefore I was not able to read it."
3,Joe Pickett Novels are a fun read,This is about the 5th Joe Pickett novel I have read. They are a fun read and put you into the beautiful outdoors everytime. Most of them I would rate at 4 stars but this one was just OK for me. Not as believable as some of the others.
3,Interesting setting,The setting and background for this story is certainly the best thing about it.The author does a very decent job in describing Wyoming in the winter.The hero is a family man and a lot of this book is about his domestic life. It is quite well handled but at times it was a bit slow moving.Some of the action scenes were well done but at times it seemed very unrealistic. Some of the villains were so over the top it was like a pantomime.I don't want to give away any spoilers but I will say that the storyline is predictable and this never lives up to the opening premise.Also at times it is very simplistic and despite its lauding of old fashioned virtues it could be quite unpleasantly nasty in certain places.
4,original replacement,I had this when it first came out for a special collection I had going for rare collectables but my dad gave it away not realizing it was a collectors purchase so I just got it again so my kids can see what was refine when I was a teenager lol brings back memories.
5,maybe I'm nuts but...,"I understand the confusion on the customer comment but Chlor-Trimeton sells both 4hr and 24 hr relief tablets, pretty easy to distinguish on the boxes on the shelf for sale, if one is paying attention. I am only sorry that the 4hr relief medication is getting very hard to find. I find the 4-hr makes me less drowsy yet works more effectively on my symptoms... perhaps only my imagination but, who cares if it gives the most needed relief (cripplingly itchy nose and/or eyes). I also have tried everything else, to no avail, so am delighted this first generation chlorpheniramine maleate product is still available. I find the side-effect of drowsiness to be minimal/manageable with the 4hr product and at least imagine the efficacy of the 4hr product to be superior to the 12hr product... go figure!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is garbage. This is the only negative review I have EVER given to a product/restaurant/dog park/etc but they totally deserve it. This pill has done nothing to improve my symptoms and I am unable to sleep because of my allergies. I notice no effect from taking the pill. Do yourself a favor and stick with a more popular, or simply just a better brand. STAY AWAY"
1,Comic Book,"I was disappointed in that I did not realize it is a comic book, and a heavy one at that. I had read the original back around 1980 and was looking forward to a novel like the original. I evidently didn't research it enough although I read the reviews at this site. I did wonder what Yukinobu Hoshino had to do with the book - I thought maybe the book cover or an illustration or two."
4,"The attached reviews are for the novel, not this manga version","While the story remains the same, there have been some changes due to the graphic novel adaptation process."
4,Jam on it!,"I was looking for a nice mix to listen to why exercising, play video games, and riding the motorcyle. This did not disappoint. And for the price, you can't beat it. I just wish the songs where separated into tracks instead of just 3 mixes. Still, good stuff!"
2,Not for me I guess.,Thought it was a great deal to get 3 hours of music for less than $3 but I just couldn't take the singing. I realize it's a matter of preference but it's not like you can just skip the songs you don't like because it's all continuous play. It just gets too annoying having to listen to those you don't like (and there are quite a few) to get to the ones you do.
5,Excellent Overview,"This book is a fantastic resource for anybody who wants to see how the uniforms of the major armies of World War 2 were worn and changed over the years. The photos are clear, and there are detailed descriptions of each piece of equipment. Other uniform book publishers should copy what Europa Militaria did with this book and their World War 1 Infantry Uniforms book.As with Europa's WW1 uniforms book, I would love to see them expand this title to also include some of the lesser known participants in the conflict (e.g. Hungary, Romania, British Commonwealth, etc.)."
3,Eden organic great northern beans,Most of the cans I received in the shipment were dented. The beans tasted good but there was too much liquid in the cans. I measured three forth of a cup. Probably will not order again.
2,Is this really the Best?,"I remember watching this show back in the good old days of imported British Comedy (with Marty Feldman, Monty Python's Flying Circus, etc.) I also remember that I enjoyed it immensely. Unfortunately, I did not get nearly as much enjoyment from this ""Best Of"" video. Is it a poor choice of sketches, or is my memory overly rosy? Whichever the case, I was disappointed in this video. It contains one of each type of sketch (one Ronnie Corbett story, one newscast, one musical comedy sketch, etc.), without the spontaneity or energy of the original show. And while admittedly some of the material is now dated, I also remember some much funnier sketches. Oh well."
4,The Two Gents of Comedy,"Somewhere between the rambunctious Benny Hill and the laid back humor of Dave Allen are The Two Ronnies, two bespectled gents who put out some funny shows on British TV. Their comedy ranges from satire to slapstick, and it's all funny."
3,Of Historical Interest Only,"This recording clearly has some historical interest, primarily because of Franco Corelli in the title role. Other than that, it sadly shows its age. The sound is thin, and sometimes tinny. It was produced to be a television show or movie, and the lip synching is often visibly un-synched. In addition, the producers think it somehow adds to the overall effect have people talking and shouting (crowd noise) over the music, so they employ this effect much too much.We still need a good DVD production of Andrea Chenier. This one is actually frustrating, because as you watch it, and listen to the wonderful music, you think ""if only this were 20 years more recent, and a good, well-produced, live recording."""
2,Not the best to rid your animal of worms.,"Listen, this is powder. If you need to rid your dogs of worms, then you need to be certain that they take the medicine, right? With this, you have no real way of being certain that they ingested all of the powder, which is why I cannot rate this above 2 stars. It was delivered on time, which is why I give it 2 and not 1."
4,works the way it is supposed to,"actually, the cable seemed to be a little different than what I took off, but it was possible without too much effort to get it to fit. don't know if I ordered wrong or the part is not quite what it is supposed to be, probably the former."
2,"you may or may not get the ""complete"" Father Brown","I ordered the Complete Father Brown but what arrived in the mail today was Father Brown Selected Stories. It has 18 stories, as other reviewers have stated. I don't know how this mix-up is happening but I can tell this is not the first time for it. So maybe you should contact the seller and specifically verify what title they have before buying. Be aware that you are taking a gamble when purchasing this book."
4,Wood splitter,I have been using one of these for a few years. It has worked well until recently. It started leaking hydraulic fluid everywhere. I'm not sure if I can fix it or even get gaskets for it.
1,LEMON,WAITED 15 DAYS-PUT TOGETHER INSTANTLY KEPT BLOWINGCIRCUIT BREAKERS TRIED 4-TIMES-THEN TRIED ON MY 4500WGENERATOR SAME{YES THE BLEED VALVE WAS OPEN]AMAZON WAS QUITE PROMPT WITH PICK-UP AND REFUND.WENT TO HOME-DEPOT GOT A RYOBI-USED 7 TIMESWORKS GREAT[FOR WHAT I WANTED IT FOR]MIGHTVE JUST GOT A LEMON-FISH
1,Don't waste your money,The first one I bought had a bad pump. The retailer immediately gave me a new unit. I chalked that up to be a fluk. The second one I got is now two years old and has only been used to split appx. 8 cords of wood. There is absolutely no ram pressure. It will not split pine that is 3 years seasoned. It has never run low on fluid and has been stored in my garage out of the elements. It looks like the pump is bad again. This is VERY DISAPPOINTING!! An absolute waste of money. I recommend buy anything else of get some excerise and split it with an axe like I now have to do.
1,No Customer Service,"It would have been nice to know about the electrical requirements before buying this machine.(Separate circuit w/time lag fuse).I contacted ""FISCH""twice by e-mail, and 3 times by phone, with ZERO responses.Apparently they don't do ""customer service"".GOOD LUCK.I would suggest getting another brand."
5,Simply Calphalon Nonstick Aluminum 2-Quart Saucepan with Cover,"All the Simply Calphalon products are excellent in design and quality of materials. The only thing we don't like is you can't put them in the dishwasher since that will damage the anodized outer finish. However, it's very easy to clean the saucepan after use, so this is not a reason to look elsewhere. Note: I put a 4 quart saucepan in the dishwasher several times, the finish was discolored, and then I applied olive oil to the finish and let it sit overnight. It seems to have worked. If you have the same issue, try a little olive oil."
2,Not so much.,"Compared to my other Calphalon pans, this one is a disappointment. It will do, but I would not buy another in this series. It is much lighter weight and the handle...which many other people have mentioned and I thought was probably a minor deal...is unpleasant to touch. I find myself leaving this pan sit and reaching for others instead. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Terrible!,"These pots are a horrible ""investment"". Everything was fine for the first couple of weeks, and then the non-stick surface damage began. This was my first set of ""real pots"" and I was overly zealous about properly caring for them. No metal utensils, no dishwasher, no abrasive cleaning utensils. The plastic brush or rag used to clean the pans apparently reaked havic on the surface. Before I knew it, the non-stick surface was peeling off and the pans were rendered useless as the surface came off into the food during cooking. Disgusting...do NOT buy. Even your best efforts to preserve these pans will not assure you they remain intact."
2,Rough and poorly made Handle,"The pan seems well made. However, the handle is rough and feels unpleasant. To me, the handle is important because this is the part I touch when I cook and it needs to be comfortable. I hate it say it, but made in China quality are usually not 100% satisfactory!"
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Far too many of the tofu recipes in this book consist of taking a block of tofu, slicing it, frying the slices and then covering them with sauce. (Tofu with Mole Sauce, I'm looking at you!)Other recipes fail because they simply try to replace meat with tofu or tempeh, rather than trying to be completely new recipes in which the soy product can shine on its own, rather than as a substitute.So far, there are only 2 recipes that I would recommend - the Spinach Burgers and the Brown Rice Pilaf. The rest? Meh. I'm still looking for a really good tofu cookbook."
1,Hard to get ingredients,"If you live in a town or city which don't have orienatl food markets, you will have to do extra work to obtain many of the special ingredients in this book through mail order or long shopping trip. Although I am in Japan, one of the oriental countries, it is not easy to get those ingredients. I don't recommend this book if you are just planning to cook with soy beans in your kitchen."
1,Misguided claims,"This book makes some pretty false assumptions based on hyped, unscientific claims. Go to the reviews for ""The Whole Soy Story,"" by Kaayla T. Daniel, and you will get previews of a book that alarmingly shows soy products to be a danger to health. Evidence is mounting that soy is an anti-nutrient, that in fact it is an extremely unhealthy substance. The way soy is manufactured, processed, and chemically altered, it has no remaining ""food"" value to speak of."
1,I recommend you pass on this one!,"I have both never written a review and never returned a book before and I have done both for this book. I looked carefully over the variety of soy cookbooks available on Amazon and was particularly pleased with the reviews this book received and so I purchased it.Unfortunately, when I received the book, I was quite disappointed. The book calls for all sorts of specialty items (soy butter, soy ham, soy yogurt, soy cheese, etc) and then pretty much just uses those soy items in an otherwise normal recipe. Even still, most of the recipies did not sound interesting or appealing.I would recommend that you try a different soy cookbook... and let me know when you find a good one!"
2,Arrogant Tone,"While I understood the author's points and even agree with some of them, I could not get over my dislike of the author's tone. He says things like ""None of this I'm afraid will seem very obvious to the citizen of the late twentieth century. If it did, there would be more outcry, more debate"" (p. 15). I found this off-putting and slightly offensive. Don't buy the book, find one of the author's articles online and read that. Same ideas, less money."
4,interesting,"This man not only does not embrace the electronic future, he's pretty sure it' belongs to the devil. He does have some affecting passages on books and reading as well as the interesting story of his own life as a writer and bookseller."
2,U.S. Maple for the neophyte?,"Answering my own question, not really. They say this is most listenable U.S. Maple album, meaning most straightforward, but do we want a straightened out version of this notoriously contorted band? Al Johnson is still one of the most inspired ""singers"" in rock, but with drummer pat samson gone, some of these songs plod when you want them to jump and lurch. If you want to get in to this band, start by picking up sang phat editor and talker. In other words don't wade in, dive!"
2,CRUSADE: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE PERSIAN GULF WAR,Atkinson's work in this venue is better suited to the board rooms of Hollywood producers. The book is not the work of a scholar and attributes fowl language to General Colin Powell and General Norman Swartzkoph that is not found in their own accounts of the war. Atkinson should study another journalist that actually was educated as an historian. I am speaking of Stanley Karnow. This book was purchased from Amazon as a review of works of military historians. It is not the novel approach that hurts the work it is his unnecessary use of explitive speech which is not appropriate in a work of historical significance.Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War
3,Crusade: Review,"I read this book, but found the usage and selection of ""$1.00"" words disrupting and un-neccesary. The content has the possibility to be a real star, but sometimes ventured off track. I would recomend this book, but warn the reader to get out the dictionary.Jerry Brightman"
5,The single best account of the Gulf War to date,"For anybody even remotely interested in what happened on the ground during the course of Desert Storm, this book is a must read! Atkinson keeps his text informative, yet entertaining. His exhaustive research and easy-to-digest prose makes this book a sure-fire way for the layman with no previous military or historical background to fully comprehend and appreciate the actions of our armed forces in this conflict."
4,Good book but not deep enough,"This was one of the first detailed books out about the Gulf War, and one I read exhaustively when it first came out, having participated as a member of the 24th Infantry Division. It is well written, suspensful, but in most cases focuses only on the ""official"" story as it was told by the Pentagon.It's difficult to write history so quickly after it happens -- for example, Atkinson barely covers the post-ceasefire battle in the Rumayla Oilfield, a very large engagement which took place after the ceasefire -- and after all the reporters had returned to Riyadh.On the whole, very solid and will give a good view of the war. Supplement by reading Seymour Hersh's New Yorker article from May 2000 to get a feel for what it was like on the ground. As a veteran, this is a book I would recommend."
1,they lie,"The box claims it's ""100% dishwasher safe"", but the material inside tells you the warranty is void if you use a dishwasher and that it has to be hand cleaned with specific brands of soap! What a rip off."
4,this lady can WRITE!,"Fascinating, different, so well-woven you'll be flipping around to connect the dots. My first read of Ms. Atwood's -- but definitely not the last!"
2,Normally an Atwood Fan...,"I wanted to like this book, really, I tried to like it and failed miserably. The three story lines were disjointed and kept the book from developing a flow. Each time I almost got interested in reading one of the plot lines she was off on another tangent, another story, another time, another place. The ending is anticlimactic - if not entirely predictable. While I usually love Atwoods writing, this time I found the characters very one dimensional and unsympathetic. I struggled to finish the book and was annoyed at the end that I had spent that much time reading it. If I had it to do over I would choose another Atwood book - any other Atwood book. While it may have won the Booker Prize, it doesn't win my reccommendation. And that is a shock."
4,A Good Melodrama for Bette Davis,"Poor little rich girls, one with icewater in her veins one the Immaculate Mary. Communist plots. Tortured artists. Cream colored Bentleys. Raging river. War. Dirty secrets. A sci-fi subplot for good measure. Can't you just see it? Atwood weaves it all together masterfully, if a little tediously."
2,Sloppy ending for novel and story within story,"I found the story within the story to be fantastic, however irrelevant to the real life characters. but, just like the novel itself, i felt it's end was premature and abrupt. i enjoyed her subtle and descriptive writing style, but not enough to pour through 500 pages only to have the story be turned on it's head and summed up sloppily in the last 25 pages."
5,One of the best books I've read in a while,"A truly unique novel that is so engrossing, I actually missed the characters when I wasn't reading it."
5,Iris Griffin-Chase,"Margaret Atwood's most recent work, The Blind Assassin, is a masterful piece of prose.The book attempts a feat of immense proportions. Iris Griffin-Chase, the narrator, is a woman in her mid-eighties. She is in the process of writing her memoirs, and in the process sharing them with us. Not only does she tell of her life, however, but she intersperses sections of a novel written by her sister, Laura Chase, who died tragically at a young age under mysterious circumstances. The ending is a surprise - suspenseful, but well supported by all three of the individual tales.The book gives a sense of what life occurences develop to make a person who they are, and also how individuals are shaped by the workings of society. Overall, the book is both insightful and entertaining."
4,A Really Different Book..!,"I have to say that the Margaret Atwood's books I have read are always highly interesting and very well-written including this one with its' intriguing ""story within a story"" plot device. Although I felt at times it slowed things down a bit,it's a trick that she pulls off very well and in lesser hands would'nt have worked at all. This book to me is a love story but, unlike most of them, it also makes you think..!"
2,clever and engaging but no heart,"This book left me with a bad feeling. All along as I was reading I kept thinking, there's something missing here. I was very interested in trying to figure out the story, but I didn't FEEL for any of the characters except in a detached kind of way. Ms. Atwood is a brilliant writer; I even copied down some passages in my journal because they were so apt. But in the end I felt as if I'd been present at the dissection of a laboratory specimen rather than engaged with or related to a human being's life story."
3,I love Atwood,"But this is not my favorite. Worth reading if you are a fan of hers. And an interesting story. Really quite beautiful. But so detailed and complex that it was hard to stay focused on it at times. I liked this book, but I didnt love it."
4,"Be patient, it's well worth the read!","I began this book on three separate occasions, but this time really pushed myself to stick with it. At some point in the middle of the book, I stopped pushing and started rolling. The end didn't leave me hanging, nor was it vague or convoluted. Everything fit together and left me with a great sense of satisfaction and enjoyment. I am an Atwood fan, and although this novel was dark and a bit thick, I think it was well worth the patience."
5,Atwood at her best,"This book is a true masterpiece and testament to Margaret Atwood's brilliance as a writer and storyteller. The blended plot lines and intermingling of science fiction with reality keep you hooked from the very beginning.Beyond it being extremely well written, rich in language and content, the story itself is incredibly moving.Read it, you'll love it."
5,Marvelous,"Reading The blind assassin is an unforgetable experience.Atwood's prose is fascinating. The book is a useful catalog of witty and savory quotations about life and relationships. The passage where Iris and Laura's mother dies is so delicate and beautiful, that I had to close the book for a while just to recover my breath. It is my first Atwood novel but it is not going to be the last. English is not my first language and, therefore, some pages were a real challenge. Well, the rewards were just incredible. Don't miss it."
2,reread another atwood!,"To any Atwood fans out there (and I'm one of them), reread one of her other books! Ultimately, the failure is in the main character. Iris is not likable, interesting nor even despicable. It's impossible to see how she could arouse any sort of passion in anyone - including apparently, Atwood herself. I forced myself to plod through hoping for redemption by the book's end. I didn't get it. Boring and ultimately not believable. Margaret, try to have more fun next time. Feels like this was written as an exercise in narrative rather than creativity."
3,I just don't know...,"I liked this book, really, but it was on the brink of taking a fatal step from suspensful to boring. It was long, drawn out, and even tedious in parts. By the middle of the book I was wishing for more clues, something to help tie the sections together, but it just kept plodding along, season by season. However, despite my impatience, Atwood's charming observations of womanhood, which I loved so much in ""A Handmaid's Tale,"" were just as wonderful in this book, and they helped me to understand how much her characters are like myself, and like every woman."
2,Too much hype...,"Maybe my expectations were too high? With all the hoopla regarding this book I certainly expected a lot more than what I got out of it. First of all it took forever for me to finnish reading the book. Though generally I'm a pretty fast reader, this one was a struggle, but I was not going to give up.I am really not sure what the point of the story was except that a lonely older women reflecting on her life.Well I wish the author would have made the reading more interesting and somewhat smoother because at least she had an interesting story line.Other than that, it certainly did not offer anything else but disappointment. Sorry about that.Thank you."
1,stupid book,"I don't know how anyone could get into this book enough to even review it! So many people praise Margaret Atwood and I just don't get it. From what I've read about the book, I'm supposed to have enough patience and finally the pieces will connect. Well, after about 35 pages, I gave up. There's too many books out there to read, without struggling with this one."
1,Unreadable!,"Unreadable! I wasted my money unless Amazon.com will give me my money back. Atwood can write interesting books with style but this certainly is not one of them. Like an aging tennis player maybe she needs to learn when to quit, or hire someone else to decide on what is a good work of art and what is not. Please don't inflict on us, your adoring public, all your work! --Strephon Kaplan-Williams"
1,I thought this book would never end.,"One barometer I use in evaluating books is how would I react if someone was reading it to me. Would I look forward to the next chapter? The most intersting part of this exercise is trying to decide what would happen first, would I slip into a coma or strangle the reader to make him/her stop reading. If one enjoys the mundane being described in utterly excruciating detail, this is the book. An almost interesting storyline poluted with merciless droning about minutia that doesn't even come close to being interesting. With all due respect to an otherwise accomplished author, this one is the poster child of wasted words."
2,Atwood Disappoints,"Let me start out by saying that I am a fan of Margaret Atwood but was sorely disappointed by BLIND ASSASSIN. I found the book tedious and uninvolving, and felt a particular disconnect when reading the novel-within-a-novel. Atwood is a brilliant writer and captures complex human experience better than anyone (read THE ROBBER BRIDE or CAT'S EYE). Unfortunately, in BLIND AMBITION she fails to capture an engaging plot."
4,Will be More Appreciated by the Ladies,"I was drawn to the book because of the author's reputation and the book's award. Who am I to give the book less than 5 stars? Well, it might be great literature but I was just not mesmerized by the story itself. In general, I think it is probably appreciated more by a female audience. Multiple fictional, romantic tales (primarily set around WWII) interweave and converge, compelling you to consider how you would respond to similar circumstances and pressures. This is not a mystery-thriller but a mystery does develop. The fact that you can solve the mystery does not detract from its impact."
3,I envy Atwood,"I love to write, and when I see an author with the skill that Atwood has it makes me jealous. Really it does...she is so enjoyable to read from a writer's perspective. But, I found that the story itself was lacking. The idea is wonderful, and of course the characterization was, but I found that when I got to certain parts I wanted to skip ahead because I was bored. This won't make me stop reading Atwood, however, she is still one of the best writers out there."
3,Such promise,The first line of the book holds such promise for an incredible journey. The book goes downhill from there. Dull. Dull. Dull.
2,Trip to the Morgue,"I was very disappointed with this book. All the complicated switching back and forth resemble a fan dance -- but there is nothing behind the fans. All the characters are dead, even the ones that are still moving around. I think Laura Chase drove off the bridge out of sheer boredom -- and I don't blame her one bit!"
2,Atwood Abandons Her Readers...,"In The Blind Assassin, Atwood revels in stylistic gymnastics and utterly abandons her readers. This novel is not so much complex as it is unecessarily complicated. Since the publication of Alias Grace, Atwood has shown a marked tendency to write with the Booker in mind. I am sincerely happy that she has been recognized by the Booker jury, but not for this particular effort.This book is so interminably unapproachable and, at points, staggeringly dull, that I fear I will never read Atwood again."
5,The Blind Assassin,"Margaret Atwood's 'The Blind Assasin' tells the story of Iris Chase Griffin and her prematurely dead sister, laura. The book alternates between the narrative of the aging Iris, which reflects on her past and her sister's, and a novel attributed to her sister, also entitled 'The Blind Assassin'. This novel-within-a-novel tells the story of a secret affair between an upper-class girl and a lower-class man. The identity of the man is discovered through Iris' story, yet Atwood keeps you guessing which sister is his lover until the very end. I loved this book, and Atwood's insights into society and humanity are poignant and true-to-life. I would recommend to anyone interested in reading a good story."
5,Atwood at her best,"I became a fan of Atwood after reading ""Handmaid's Tale."" Not only her subject but her style of writing impressed me.""Blind Assassin"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Atwood skillfully creates a story in which you feel for all of the characters involve. A wonderful book."
3,Many virtues; a few major vices,"She's an excellent writer and the Booker Prize was well-deserved and long overdue. But this is far from her best work. If you don't know Margaret Atwood, don't start here -- The Robber Bride and Handmaid's Tale are much better and I strongly recommend them. Virtues of this book: Interesting story, well written. Vices: (1) Too long! 520 pages is about 1/3 longer than this book should be. Hello, any editors in the house? (2) Cheap technique of anonymous story (Can you guess who this couple are, gentle reader?) is too obvious and corny, adds nothing to book. (3) Flashback and flashforward structure constantly wears thin after a while. Summary: Good story, interesting characters, flawless prose, but severe structrural defects."
2,Sloppy Editing on the Kindle Edition,"I started the book and it is promising, but eventually had to stop, because on almost on every page is a typesetting error ... mostly a missing space character after a period/sentence. It started as a minor nuisance but after about a tenth of the book these had me stop reading it and being royally pissed ... which I somewhat regret because I think I would have enjoyed the story."
5,a great read,"While a bit difficult to sort out where the plot was going, this was a ""can't put down"" read once you get in to it."
4,"Slow to start, then fantastic","Atwood's novel begins a little slowly, but quickly becomes a page turner you don't want to put down. Despite the fact that the ""ending"" (the suicide of the narrator's sister) is given away in the first two lines of the book, Atwood still kept me on the edge of my seat. She weaves together the present, the future, and several alternate universes completely seamlessly and smoothly. Her characters are well-rounded and have strong, distinct personalities. The book is hugely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it."
5,Best of Atwood,"To me, ""The Blind Assassin"" is Atwood at her very best. The story glistens with its different facets without feeling aimless or gimmicky. Every twist, turn, and dive of the plot has purpose, and the characters are full and real. The moments of humor shine against the drama and action, and I appreciated that the ending wasn't the obvious."
3,A Difficult Read,"I was lent a copy of The Blind Assassin by a friend who didn't want to give me her opinion before I'd read it myself. I found it difficult to read because Atwood would jump from character to character without making it obvious who was, at that point, telling their story. About halfway through, I finally got the feel of the book and thoroughly enjoyed the remainder.Afterwards, however, as a result of going through some of amazon.com's Readers' Reviews, I was led to read Atwood's prior novel, Alias Grace. This latter book proved to be a far better story, more well-written and much easier for me to read. As a result, I will continue on with another of her novels."
3,But she is a blonde,"I read in Time that this was THE book to read for 2000. The illustration on the cover should have warned me that this is not the book of the year. First Iris is a blonde, secondly I didn't find the story to be so compelling that I could not put the book down. In fact, I made myself finish i just so I could verify my opinion.I assume because it has a story within a story that this is a remarkable achievement for the author. However, Anna's Book was similar to this so I didn't feel it was all that unusual."
2,"Long, Long, and needs an editor","I listened to this on cassette tape. After the first three tapes I realized that the author was telling a story from the first person way too much. There is a rule in writing good fiction, show not tell. She had to tell a lot since it was first person, but she could have did more showing to make it more interesting.After the third tape, I resolved to listen to the last tape, number eleven, and then pick back up with number four. This was to see if she was going anywhere. She wasn't. I found out that the other tapes were essentially useless. I missed a little plot development, but not much. I'm not going to listen to the other tapes.A good editor would have told her to cut this novel in half, then it might have kept the readers attention.On the plus side, she's a good writer with a good style. I might pick up another of her novels and try again."
2,too heavy going,"I tried to stick with it, but the story bounces around too much for me to really get interested. Would prefer the development of story line not bounce so much"
3,Predictable,"Predictable is my word for this overly hyped novel. To be sure, the story is cleverly crafted so as to force the reader to read, the story within the story within the story, all the way to the end, end, end. But when I finally got to the end, I found it, well, predictable."
2,Certainly not for me...,"What a boring, fragmented, long-winded book this is. In ""The Blind Assassin"" Margaret Atwood has produced a cast of characters so unsympathetic and one dimensional that one cares very little about them or what happens to them. On top of that, her writing is so heavy handed that she telegraphs all of their ""sordid secrets"" well ahead of their denouement. This is one foot-dragging plod from start to finish."
2,The Booker Prize winner? Surely not!,"Atwood writes very well. That's the good news. However, the story is dull, depressing, slow-moving, and obvious--yes, obvious. Virtually all of the plot twists are telegraphed so completely that the book's surprises come as no surprise at all. As the narrator unfolds her life, it is so pathetic and, honestly, uninteresting that one should admire Atwood's fortitude in completing the manuscript. But if you think a famous author and a famous prize make a book worth reading, you're as mistaken as I was! Learn from my mistake!"
3,Could not finish this book,"I am echoing another person's review, I usually adore Atwood's books, I've read most of them. But I could not get into this book. I did not even finish it."
4,Complex But Rewarding,"There are two things I really liked about this novel: it is difficult to draw obvious parallels between the main narrative lines; and, the main character is not easy to like -- my sympathy for her is hard won. These may not seem like positive attributes, but they are important aspects of a book that I won't soon forget. I liked this novel's complexity, it's richness of character, and it's mystery. And as a Torontonian, it was nice to see some Canadian place-names in there!"
3,A Complicated Plot w/ exuberant amounts of description,"This book featured compelling characters and a complicated double plot line. The description was abundant and compelling, but overwhelming at times. The book takes the reader through several decades of the 20th century but the reading requires very steady concentration as the plot jumps from present to distant past. There were many times when I wanted to move to the next event and progression but I was stymied by long passages describing clothes being worn and the leaves around the sites. The book was a good trip through the mores of the 20th century."
2,Yawn,"I found this book to be boring. I finished the last line of ""The Button Factory Picnic"" chapter, turned the page to start the next chapter and a feeling just came over me of ""do I have to keep reading this?"" I felt like I had been waiting and waiting for something to happen but the story just droned on and on. I had absolutely no interest in the story within the story (about the sacrifical virgin, etc.). I finally gave it up at page 182. I loved M. Atwood's The Handmaiden's Tale and I have Alias Grace on my shelf. Think I'll give that one a try after awhile since it seems to have gotten good reviews here."
2,Author didnt turn me on,"Ho hum. Ordered this for our book club, but found it tedious and quite redundant. I DO not recommend for anyone."
2,Slow as molasses in a Canadian blizzard,"... Tons of languid, artful description, but not much movement, epitomizes the self-indulgent plague of modern literature: too many pages for not enough plot.The novel inside the novel is even more of a snoozer, and the sci-fi story inside the inner novel is a total waste of time...Stan JonesAnchorage, Alaska"
2,"Beautiful prose, not much else","After reading about 300 pages the ""complicated"" plot twists had all been straightened out, and the only reason to drudge through the remainder of the book was the hope of coming across more of Atwood's occasionally poignant passages. The novel does cover a lot of ground, just not very well. Class tension, blah. The depravity beneath the genteel surface, blah. This is not a novel with incisive observations about life. Which could be excused if the story and characters were engaging. Laura was the only interesting character, but unfortunately, due to the method of narration was only seen sparingly in the second half.Could have been four stars with 200 less pages and tauter descriptive passages. The story itself would have still been trite, but at least it wouldn't have taken so long to get through. There IS beautiful writing here, it's just stuck in a dull story with mostly dull characters."
3,it's a literature book,"This was very reminiscent of the stuff you had to read in high school, lots of imagery, deeper meanings, poetic language, but like most of the stuff from high school... BORING, just plain boring.It's hard to write a bad review of this book, it's well structured, it has some really good jabs at society and has some great black/perverse humor in it, all good qualities for reading and it's probably worth reading just for that. But it has main characters that I just didn't care about, and a plot that wasn't that complex but took over 600 pages to muddle through. Also, after about 500, Atwood/editor must've realized she was dragging on, and kind of finished off the loose threads and called it a book. And the last kicker, the great secret revealed at the end, very foreseeable.oh well, wasn't a complete waste, but less than I expected"
2,Not worth the effort,"I'm sorry but although I think Margaret Atwood is an excellent, imaginative writer, it was an absolute struggle to get through this book. It almost seemed as if she was trying to show how clever and imaginative she could be by writing essentially three stories, all with different tones, but I just found it boring. By page 500 I really had no interest in the characters and finished the book merely because I ""come this far"" didn't want to give up. Her descriptions of Winifred and Avilion were tedious, the story in the Blind Assassin novel was confused, she spent hundreds of pages covering a very short time frame in her life but then devoted what seems like a page and a half to the Aimee/Sabrina portion of her life. I would skip this one and read Alias Grace instead. It's just as imaginative, it also keeps you guessing, but it is a much, much better book."
2,I'm sure it must get better,I've had this book for years. I can never get even half way through it. I just picked up again over the weekend thinking I'm a few years older and maybe my taste have changed...maybe I can get into this book. It's not workng.
2,Inaccessible prose,"Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down. It was almost aggravating."
5,A true craftsman,"Margaret Atwood has created another work of beauty. Using flashbacks interspersed with present day, newspaper clippings with daydreams, Atwood brings the reader into the story of the Blind Assassin so smoothly one does not realize they are so involved in the story.I have to say though that I did skim the novella within the novel. I don't like science fiction, and it didn't hold my attention. Don't let that stop you though. This book is well worth your time."
4,Beyond Intertwinement,"Margaret Atwood's Blind Assassin definitely proves itself to be the most masterfully designed novel that I have ever read. It's about the lives of Laura and Iris Chase and their complicated lives. In addition, the book opens a novel within a novel, dubbed the Blind Assassin by Laura Chase, in which two unnamed lovers meet in dirty backrooms. The book is told by Iris Chase, and between her own anecdotes about her life and the mini-novel, any reader will have their hands full in making the connections between the two and discovering things that Iris won't tell them openly."
1,"Blind Assassin, a Soap Opera","I purchased this book as a Christmas present for myself after reading the very favourable review in Time. Critics are easily pleased. The book is a big let down. As a ""soap"" its tops. Its snail pace is irritating. The definitive description nearly rates with Dickens, the master of description. This story could easliy fit into 300 less pages. Save the forests, read the phone book. The use of the word ""entitled"" in chapter X11 (the Globe & Mail, Oct 7, 1938) in the first line of ""Griffen Lauds Munich Accord"" is incorrect English. It should be ""TITLED""! I'm donating this book to the next school fete."
2,Watching a train wreck in slow motion,The characters were not likeable and the plot was predictable.I'm do not know why it was so acclaimed.
1,A Very Difficult Read,"I wanted to enjoy this book, it was a pick by our book club. Unfortunately I found it disjointed, boring and cruel. Perhaps a more ""intellectual"" person would find it enjoyable. It had fantastice critical reviews, however......"
3,just a little under par...,"the reviews for this book were so great that I had to read it. I found though that it was choppy, i couldn't figure out what was going on, and it was terribly difficult to read. However, if you get through it you are dying to know who's who and whats what and why it all happened. Didn't really like the sci-fi stuff mixed in...personal opinion there.all and all good, but not as good as everyone said."
4,"Excellent writing, melancholy book","This book was masterfully written with a unique story-telling style. The mystery drove me to the end of the book. I was compelled by the story, but it was a bit melancholy and left me feeling a little empty."
3,Try 3 other novels,"A story within a story within a story. The novelist writting about a woman writting about a novelist (her sister) and we get the sister's novel to boot and guess what? _That_ novel is about an author. My, my.The idea is hardly new, but Atwood brings it off very well.The problem is that none of the stories going simultaneously in this lengthly novel are all that interesting. It's just a tad preachy and I find Margaret's stretching to put at least one pithy, quotable phrase on each page a bit tiresome. Though she has a humorus streak throughout this.Half way through you know what's coming, no fault in and of itself, but getting to the end is not rewarding.I'll wait for the film. THAT could be something!"
2,Way overrated! A struggle!,"This book started out interesting due to its confusion, once you figure it out it is painfully dark and boring. Way overhyped. Quite a let down."
3,Could've been a hundred pages shorter.,"This could've been a really great book if it had been 100 pages shorter. The plotting structure is unique, the character are each widely different and vividly drawn. When they were on stage the story was moving I was glad to be there. But the unending narration is just boring. If I hadn't had so much time invested in it by the time I decided it wasn't going to get any better, I don't think I would have finished it."
5,Best of the year,"I can already tell this will be among my favorite books for the year, maybe because you get three stories in one, and Margaret Atwood is masterful at interweaving them. Plot, language, charaterization, it has them all."
2,The Blind Assassin,"I could not get into this book at all. The main storyline about the sisters I enjoyed and I wish the book had only been about their story but the ""Blind Assassin"" part I hated. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Hard to get into,"I hated this book. It was so hard to get into and when I did get into it, it would change perspectives or jump to a different subject. If you're looking for something easy and relaxing to read, this is not it."
1,THE BLIND ASSASSIN - CATCHY TITLE FOR A CRUMBLE BOOK,"I am retired, have an Ivy League PhD in English Literature and still read 2 or 3 novels a day. You would think that after so much practice writing, Margaret Atwood would finally come through with a genuine sizzler. A sizzler 'The Blind Assassin' is not. It is more like a small, once white hot coal doused with with a gallon of water during a driving tropical rain storm. The stuff for potential is there in the novel but it just doesn't cut the mustard. Atwood likes to put in the literary descriptive details a la Edgar Allen Poe, she has adopted some kind of twisted emulation of William Faulkner's style it seems to me - the end result is a disturbed mish mash of Margaret Atwood's mental masturbation. Grow up or give up Margaret. If you want to read a five star version of ""The Blind Assassin"", read Steven King's ""Insomnia"" - it is the best 1900's love story I've probably read in the last 10 years and yes, a genuine white hot sizzler."
1,"Overlong, Boring, Pretentious and Smug: Atwood Does it Again","Some twenty years after swearing off Canada's most bloodless writer (and that's saying something!), a friend convinced me to give Atwood's newest a shot. Well, she hasn't improved at all, unless you count her typing speed (although even that's probably owed merely to more advanced technology). Atwood as always presents a completely miserably, downtrodden life, where the characters have no hope for redemption, let only a chuckle. Whereas other writers with bleak views at least give the reader bones like wit (Martin Amis), raunch (Charles Bukowski), or poetry (Alice Munro), Atwood just serves it up bland and humorless. Call me again in another 20 years."
1,What did I miss?,"I must have missed something, because I just don't get much more disappointed in a book than I was in The Blind Assassin. I have both loved (The Haidmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye, The Robber Bride)and hated (Alias Grace) Atwood's other works. This falls into the ""hate"" category. It was never interesting and not particularly well written. The science fiction story was just plain painful. Was the ""surprise"" really much of a surprise? I'm rarely disappointed in Booker Prize winners; what happened here?"
1,"Ms. Atwood, I would like these several hours back.","I really can't figure out what this novel is about or why it was written. I guess it's an admirable showcase of period slang and historical events, but otherwise it's a collection of the rambling senior citizen angst of a completely limp narratrix who has got nothing to relate but a depressing account of her failures and should-haves. That is, when she can decide what she should have done. There are some good bits, like the description of the mansion, but the story simply does not go anywhere but down into a morass of the narrator's self-pity, like The Color Purple without any redemption or character arc whatsoever."
4,Good quality and fast shipping,Book arrived quickly and in better condition than I expected for buying a used book. Great!
3,"strong start, weak finish","this book was very interesting for the first 350 pp or so, but then started to collapse. i was disoriented for the first part of the novel but then things started to come together for me and i began to enjoy planet zycron, and the interweaving of this story with iris' past. however, by p 350 iris' story began to lag and somewhere around here atwood left zycron to itself. as a reader i wanted to know more about iris' relationship to laura as an adult, and i could not believe that these characters were as isolated as they were portrayed to be. i almost got the sense that atwood herself began to lose interest in her characters. my recommendation: read alias grace instead, a far superior novel."
5,"Two very different types stories eventually converge, and it's fascinating","I am addicted to this book. It's well written, and engaging, and sad, and exciting. I highly recommend this, especially for someone who is about to go on a long trip somewhere."
3,Good,"Enjoyed the book but the storyline was a little odd. It was a quick read, I finished it fast on my kindle."
4,Novel within a novel within a novel,"A novel within a novel within a novel, and the innermost nested one is a bizarre science fiction fable. As the story of two sisters and their family's fall from grace slowly unravels, the reader is drawn in, ensnared in the interspersed recounting of an illicit love affair, during which the lovers spin out the sci fi story. This is an intricate and enthralling book."
3,too much math for the layman,"I'll just add that there's definitely a problem with an inconsistent level of sophistication in the mathematics. I remember freshman calculus pretty well but am hazy on differential equations, and *The Odd Quantum* lost me starting with Schroedinger's equation - just when it's getting to the good stuff! (By contrast there isn't any calculus in the first three chapters.) I'm still looking for something beyond popular science books that's not too technical."
3,Another Introductory Book,"It starts easy, you feel good until you hit the foundations. Author dives into Schroedinger's equation and even worse he starts to use a lot ""Eigen.****"" in the form of value, function, state etc so that you really have to slow down to comprehend clearly. Subject gets deeper and deeper and he himself says similaer to saying ""just take it from me as it is correct"". Than provides simple problems and solutions. Although the examples are standard that you find in any introductory course textbooks, the thechincal language he uses makes them difficult to follow. I think this book is not as easy as advertised to be. I do not blame anybody remember after all there is phrase that only few people knows what Quantum Mechanics is. You may want to read this book after reading few more introductory books especially with some formulas and calculations. If you do not know what Eigenvalue is,which author does not even define it, than you better read some calculus before you read this book."
5,Perfect,"My kids love it so I gave it a 5 star. We normally buy a elderberry/echinacea mixture syrup, but decided to get a simple echincea extract to keep in the home for when needed and this is great. Kids loved the taste so it is kid approved :)"
2,not good,"I bought this for my Mother.She is 86 years old and has rhumatoid arthritis.Staying warm is important to her because it helps the pain.I bought a higher priced product than I would have for myself because,well it's my Mother.When it arrived I talked to her and she said I got ripped off.The material is very thin.More like a heated sheet than a blanket.The color is not blue like it was pictured.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!It did work but a sunbeam for half the price would have been a better deal and product and I bet the color would have been same as pictured.I guess I could have sent it back but Mom lives 250 miles away and It would have all been on her.In the end I just bought a sunbeam at walmart.Half the price."
1,Terrible fabric,"I actually hate this blanket. The warming works just fine, but the fabric feels like cotton candy! I need a sheet between me and the blanket, and then a microplush blanket over it so I never have to touch the darn thing. It's scratchy and very acrylic-y...the most unpleasant sleep experience I've had in a blanket. I hope it breaks soon...so I can justify buying a new blanket. Then there's always Black Friday or Christmas..."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I read the reviews before ordering this blanket, however I don't think that the reviewers purchased this model. A down comforter has MORE warmth than this blanket even on high. I let this blanket warm up on high for over 1 1/2 hours and the bottom part near the toes never even got warm. The warmest part was near the head and that was lukewarm at best.I remember the electric blanket that my grandmother purchased about 20 years ago, and I wish I could find something of similar quality and durability on the market now. I had hoped that this blanket would end that quest. Unfortunately, this is the 2nd worst electric blanket I have ever purchased and I'm returning it tomorrow."
5,Simply the best documentary on the Great White Shark.,"This is without a doubt the best of the narrow ""Watch the Great White Shark eat seals and surfboards' genre. I have seen every...and I do mean EVERY...great white shark documentary from late 60's stuff (""Wow, that shark is far out! Check out the groovy way he chews the cage!"") to Jaws-style quickie documentarys (""The brutal shark circles its victims before smashing its teeth around their unprotected torsos...."") to the eco-friendly films of today. This one is intelligent, thought-provoking, and very, very well made. Highlights include attack footage that reminds one of the ""lion vs. antelope"" documentaries, an excellent section where a camera is tethered to the back of a large GW, and up-to-date information and theories on why the GWs sometimes attack humans. If you are a shark fan or know someone who is, this is a MUST-HAVE. END"
2,Not really coated for Inkjet. Not any better than copy paper,This is probably the lowest priced inkjet paper on market. But the result is very disappointing. It is absolutely no better than any generic copy paper. It is shameful for Hammermill to market it as inkjet paper.
5,Pleased as Punch,I was very pleased with the product and I was especially pleased with the service. It arrived several days earlier than I expected. Thanks
1,Less than expected,"This product was not of the quality that I have come to expect from Calphalon. I have a full line of their products and have been extremely pleased up to now. This pot was estremely light-weight (can you say flimsy?) and, while the packaging showed no outward appearance of being damaged during shipping, was more oval in shape than round. Obviously, the strainer insert that I ordered with it did not come close to fitting.On the plus side, Amazon made the process of returning both products quite painless and I was able to re-order a much better item in it's place."
4,Simply Calphalon 8-Quart Stockpot with Cover,Our family makes a lot of soup and Chili! This is a great size for a family of 3 or 4. So far the quality of the Simply Calphalon has been what we expect from this brand as most of our pots are Calphalon.
3,Helpful - with limits,"As I am making my daughter's wedding gown, I bought this book. The first part, dealing with gown types, styles, and silhouettes, was of no value; we had already chosen a pattern. The section on customizing fit is very basic (I sew a lot and can do most of this), but if you are not experienced, it would be very helpful. The same is true of the fabric selection, sewing basics, and special bridal fabrics chapters. The laces and hems chapters included a good bit of information that I have never needed and was unfamiliar with. What made this most useful for me were the sections on underpinnings and veils. Instructions are clear and well-illustrated. All in all, if you sew a lot, you probably don't need this book, but if you are an average seamstress and nervous about the project, this would be a excellent book for you."
5,Buy this tape or I'll --- Vivyan,It's a rare thing when a short lived TV show maintains a cult status. Especially Brittish comedey. Benny Hill ran for years. Monty Python filmed several seasons and many movies. The Young Ones only made twelve episodes over two years. With so few installments the show packed such a punch to the funny bone that it's still being felt today. Every episode contains so much humor that watching them over and over is an easy thing to do. Any fan of laughter and truly unpredictable comedy must buy these tapes. You won't be sorry; even if you are a 'complete bast**d' as Vivyan would say.
4,A Must-See for all fans of silly English humor!,"As a teen in the early eighties (as well as a punk and fan of all things British) I'd seen the Young Ones on PBS/BBC broadcasts , then later on early MTV, and could not get enough. I've had second generation dubs from the tv on tape, but it's never quite as good is it? The eccentric and often illogical humor of the five main players in the cast of The Young Ones is classic. If you love the Pythons, Fawlty Towers, Benny Hill (RIP) or even Bean, the Young Ones must not be missed. Enjoy the entire twelve episode series, and CHEERS!!"
5,Hilarious,"The young ones is the funniest sitcom ever to be made, it far outrates the american trash being broadcast right now (freinds, the nanny)it is violent yet continues to be funny in its own disgusting way and its storylines are beyond the sick. it is a sign of the times, but it is timeless Brilliant"
4,Good book for PA studies,"I think this is very good book for Public Administration studies. The only beggary is, that is very difficult to read for nonenglish people!"
5,Love this season so far,I am so glad this show was renewed. Love the new writing. I agree with another review that the show doesn't need Ben. He is a waste of my time. I could use more of Justin. I also love that they are dressing Kate better. She is a gorgeous woman and first season they had clothes on her that I think came from a thrift store or something. Much better this season all around.
4,Good season,"This season like the previous season was funny, romantic and enjoyable. I like this actress and story line. Good 2nd season"
4,Very Entertaining,Very catchy lines and well scripted. Loved the characters and wardrobe. Recommend it as an interesting love triangle with lots of heart.
3,Fairly Legal,"Fun show. Pretty simple and predictable and as usual it had lots of great looking ladies. Nothing like lawyers in 6"" heals..."
4,loved watching Fairly Legal on Amazon streaming,"I was so glad that I could watch these episodes of Fairly Legal on Amazon streaming. It was nice to be able to watch them whenever I wanted, especially when my family wanted to watch something else of our television.Borderline"
5,Wonderful World!,"This is a top-notch series, with a great cast! I have been watching avidly since the premiere episode, and folks, it keeps getting better and better each episode."
2,really dislike this season,"the addition of the Ben character has been a big fail as far as I am concerned. He is just annoying, and adds nothing to the show. Cancelled my season pass."
1,lil grossed,"I am a bit grossed out by the whole feelings for Ben, a self centered blood sucking lawyer that the arc of the show is that she is trying to change the way lawyers like him and the whole legal system uses average people. It kind of takes the whole heart of the story away for me. I will not watch it any more, or at least until they do away with the Ben thing."
3,good and Ok,"The first half of the Cd was Ok. It was very laid back contemporary. I like harder rock stuff but still enjoy lots of contemporary. So the first half was contemporary but didnt really grab my attention.The second half comes on and its very noticeable in dynamics. Much harder sound, more edgier, more raw. Both artists are very talented. It was a nice CD to listen to but I thought their would be others that would enjoy these bands more than I."
2,I Was Expecting So much More...,I know about Brother Question from the Roots. I know of Christian McBride from some of the CD's in my Jazz collection. I expected Question to bring the funk on with the drum. I was expecting this album to move...it just lounges. It seemed one dimentional to me. I was even more disappointed to hear the Remixed-Philadelphia Experiment. Great!--remixed mediocrity.
2,Big Dissapointment,"There are good musicians on this CD and some good tunes, but this thing sounds like it was recorded and mixed by amatures. The guitar is in a muddy mix, the bass is a rumble and even the trumpet barely rises above the mass. The only thing that has any clarity is the drum, which is relentless. tracks. If you can make it through the first 4 tracks, you can probably live with the CD, but my guess is you'll tire of it in a hurry."
3,If Only...,"There was actual emotion to this cd. They put in a good effort, but it just gets too boring. The same beats and no intensity and climax. I'm a huge fan of the Roots, but he can't swing with Uri man! And I wanted to hear some genius from Uri's creative side. But I wouldn't mind playing it as background music."
2,Thumbs Down !!,"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this release. The mix is horrible. I'm a bassist, but I have to say the bass was WAY TOO UP in the mix. The drums sound like a tonka toy drum kit and everyone else is too far back in the mix. I'm trying to listen to what the musicians have to say but the mix is so unattractive that the music became grating to my ears after a few tracks. What were the producers hearing ???But in spite of the mix I don't think too much was really going here. Can't recommnend this CD."
5,Philly HipHop/Jazz Fusion at it's Finest,"This album is best described as 'jazz/hiphop fusion'. If you like either of these styles, you will love this album. With hiphop group The Root's drummer, jazz bass player Christian McBride and a few other great musicians drawn from varius musical backgrounds, this album is full of creativity and great groovin tracks. A little known fact is that McBride actually went to high school with the original roots members and is considered 'an original root' himself, and it shows on this album. You gotta check this out!

5,Incredible!!!,"I received this bag as a baby shower gift from my mother (who purchased it from spoilmeinstyle boutique), so I was able to have it packed and ready for the hospital before my little girl decided to come. This bag has so much more room than I ever could have imagined. We were able to pack all of our baby outfits, burp cloths, blankets, etc. for the hospital in this bag. Additionally, we fit many of our items for the labor/delivery room including framed ultrasound photos, cell phones, wallets, gum/mints, chapstick, pens, paper, game books, etc. We have also used this bag each time that we have gone out of town, and it has been perfect for the trip. Although our daughter's clothes continue to grow with her, there remains ample room in the bag to pack for long weekends out of town. I highly recommend this bag!"
1,STUPIDITY!!!,"Just a little tip about selling things on the internet. Actually know what your talking about!!! ""RINGwraiths"" ok how many times does Harry Potter mention a ring in any of the freaking movies. STUPID!!!!! Your definetly mistaking Dementors for RINGwraiths!!!Lord of the Rings!!!! NOT HARRY POTTER!!! Got It? But its ok. JUST FIX IT!!!"
1,Get your books straight,"Perhaps the creators of this costume do not know their error... but the ""Ringwraith"" is a creature from the Lord of the Rings series, not anything from HP."
4,Good line of pans,"For almost two years I've had several sizes of these pans. They have good weight and balance, are very easy to clean quickly, and are reasonably priced.Regarding the dishwasher, I have put some of the smaller pans in there, however I've found that since these are so easy to clean because of the nonstick surface, it's easier and faster to do it by hand -- about as quick to wash by hand as it is to load into the dishwasher and unload later.Before purchasing, I considered the tri-ply pans, however the handles were terrible, especially when trying to hold the additional weight. Plus they are much more expensive.I'd definitely recommend this pan to anyone - great product and good price."
5,really nice omelet pan!,This is an excellent omelet pan. The price was great ($25) and it's solid and high quality. You cannot go wrong!
2,fell apart,I bought this pan a few years back. This morning while cooking breakfast the bottom piece separated from the rest of the pan. i loved this pan but now it is useless. The way it is constructed they basicly welded the bottom piece on and it is not on there forever. beware!!!
3,It left me wanting more - a lot more,"While the content presented is excellent and well laid out, the point of view is based very much on Ken Burns' personal tastes. There are many great artist with great stories who were either glossed over or left out entirely. I recommend that anyone with an interest in jazz read this book. However, if you have a somewhat indepth knowledge of jazz history,or are looking for a particular favorite artist, you might be a little disappointed."
4,Not very new,"It is not very new, but it's ok. I haven't read it, but I think I'll like it. It is required by my professor. I guess it's a good book to learn about American music history."
4,A Good Introduction To Jazz,"I would endorse this book and the accompanying series as a way for neophytes to enter an extremely challenging and complicated genre and as a reasonably good summation of the history of Jazz through 1960. But I would hope that Ken Burns' work isn't received as the final word on Jazz. Too often projects of these nature take on a Hand of God character and are regarded simply as the final take on a theme. Not so here, and anyone who knows the history of Jazz will point to numerous ommissions throughout the series. But if you're looking for a good entertaining way to learn or enjoy Jazz, this is probably a good bet. And if even one person ends up liking Jazz as a result of Burns' work, the world will be a better place. The series can't hurt and the debate is healthy. It just shouldn't be regarded as the only word on the subject."
5,Interesting and entertaining book,I brought this for a class and it is one of the few books I continue to read afterword. This is an excellent book.
3,Nothing new here,"I didn't care for the book. Sure it's pretty and will get some folks interested in the music, but I found the treatment a bit heavy-handed. Talking about musicians as bold innovators and soul stylists and technical wizards is all a bit much for me. Many of the greatest jazz musicians were addicts and just generally not very nice people. Also, I really didn't see anything in that book that I haven't seen in other books. It almost looks as though Burns took a ""best of"" approach to a lot of other jazz history books out there. Personally, I've had enough of the who, what, when, and where that you can read any old dusty history book. What I want is the how and why and this book certainly doesn't answer either question. One last note: any jazz history book that talks about Wynton Marsalis more often than it mentions J.J. Johnson is not a book I'm going to spend money on."
5,"Outstanding,hilarious and appetizing!","The life, and trials of a great chef, his wife and a band aid. If you like food, cooking and humor, this must not be missed. An obsessed chef, with his intelligent wife, try to take over the failing restaurant where he works, with unexpected results."
5,Great Biting Sarcastic British Humor!,"If you liked the irate and biting humor of Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, you are going to absolutely love Chef Gareth Blackstock. Chef runs his kitchen with terror and venom, just as Basil ran his hotel... the problem is that his wife is actually running the show, and only lets Chef think he's in control."
5,"At its worst, it is better than anything on NBC Thursday","The only sad part is that this is all of Lenny Henry most Americans will ever see. He is right up there with John Cleese, Jennifer Saunders, Rowan Atkinson, hell anyone who is breathing, as the funniest person alive.He is also helped by a great supporting cast. The actors who play Janice, his wife, and Everton, his whipping boy, are perfect. It is a great introduction to a great show. The second season was better though, just to see Gaston, the recovering alcoholic sous chef."
5,Encouraging and Intelligent!,"Enjoyed reading this book by Kendra Smiley. I thought it was clever to include Aaron's perspective as well. Although I wouldn't necessarily say my children are strong-willed, I think Kendra's guildelines apply to the discipline and raising of any child."
5,A Deep Family Mystery,"Faith is a young woman from a haunted family. One of her aunts has been hanged for killing her other aunt, and the family labors under the shadow of this tragedy. Why did it happen, and what were the inner tensions which led to the murder. A Dark Adapted Eye skillfully unravels the layers of mystery and tension which developed over many years until finally reaching a partial resolution.A Dark Adapted Eye was the first book by Barbara Vine, Ruth Rendell's alter ego. I enjoy Vine's mysteries because they examine how past events effect the present and leave invisible wounds on those who participate or merely witness. This television adaptation was produced in Britain in the early 1990s and was first shown on PBS' Mystery. It features excellent performances, particularly by Celia Imrie and Helena Bonham-Carter. It has thus far not been released in DVD or Blu-Ray, but I hope that it will be eventually."
3,OK,"ok quality even for blu ray, too much talking and not enough monster truck action, nice back ground story on the owners of the monster truck"
1,Not good.. Not good at all.,Barely has any Monster Truck stuff. 80% of the time some guy is interviewing drivers.. I got this for my son and he barely paid it any attention. I was not happy with this BluRay..
3,soso,"it starts off really slow and boring, but they eventually go into better segments where they show the controls and other parts of the trucks that are not as well known. some parts get really annoying because they show the same clips over and over again, including clips from dirt bikes, bull riding, etc, not just monster trucks. if you are into how monster trucks work, its worth the $8."
5,Perfect baby gift!,These are the cuttest bunny slippers ever. Great quality and a very nice box for gift giving. Worth the price.
5,"Wow, Steve Perry....great ""Conan Writer""","I was enthralled right at the start of this book. I've been reading Conan books for a long time and can honestly say Steve Perry's ""Conan The Fearless"" is my favorite with ""Conan The Defiant"" a close second (another Steve Perry masterpiece). The villains are intriguing, the plot is well thought out and Conan couldn't be more dashing, courageous and explicit. Robert E. Howard's work is done justice by Steve Perry.His story telling is of the mature nature but not over the top. I just wish Mr. Perry had wrote more Conan books!!"
1,Misleading title - can Fodor count?!?!?,I was highly disappointed by this book. Several of the 'Best 25' were all actually buildings within the Forbidden City. The book should be more appropriately titled 'Beijing's 20 Best'. It also did not warn people that different tours to the Great Wall are differentiated by either the most visited section which is almost completely restored and crowded versus another section that is less traveled and for the more die-hard culturalists. The map was also too large to read easily while in a taxi or traveling on foot. This book added almost no value to my trip.
4,nice puzzle game,"Students love it. A little too 'cute' for middle school students, but they enjoy it anyway. Am told I'm in trouble if I lose any parts as there isn't a place to buy replacements. I would have bought an extra set of pieces for a small fee if they had it available!Nice variation on the 'traffic jam' game (which I give a 5 star rating!).PS I am a social worker in a school system. I use these games to challenge students as well as teach skills of needing to calm down to focus and developing creative problem solving skills. It's amazing how well they work for helping kids realize they can't focus when upset, as well as practicing attention and focus skills on a fun but challenging activity."
2,EXp3 Journalism Wkbk Review,"This is not what I had expected, but, it does require student's to do a lot of writing, and coorelates with the textbook."
3,"A springboard to creativity, but...","Probably of greatest value to Agencies. The designs in this book will only be purchased by clients with BIG budgets!At least 25% of the examples, are ideas I will never have an opportunity to use in this lifetime.Some of the examples are for clients with very specific niche markets. Still there are helpful over-arching principles that can be applied to your projects.I see this book as part of your non-core library. A good resource, but you won't use it everyday."
2,Nice Design but Cheap Quality. I paid too much !!!,"I picked this up at my local Ritz Camera Store for my Panasonic Lumic DMC-FX8 and whilst I love its design and compact size, its build quality is not the best. In fact, I would say it's mediocre. I have owned numerous cameras and even the ""generic"" camera cases that I have bought on eBay were of better craftmanship. Nothing aligns exactly right - the zipper is skewed and even the felt circles that covered the rivets (for the straps) on the inside were not glued securely. If I had known this, there's no way I would have paid $15 !!!"
3,not the one i expected,I use to have the same case but smaller and thought this was the same one. This one is a little bit larger then what i wanted
4,okay book,"the book was okay. interesting ideas, not too many that I didn't already know or do with the kids. Easy read."
3,It's okay.,"We're sort of starting to homeschool this year with our 2.5 year old. We're setting aside an hour or so every day for structured learning. Of course, I can't do anything without checking out 15 books on the subject (hence the stuffed library bags), so I've got a lot of preschool books to browse in the next few weeks. This one isn't anything spectacular. It's got a few cute ideas like Jello Jiggler ABC's or Family and Friends Phone book with pictures,but nothing you couldn't find browsing Pinterest for a few minutes. Wait-who browses Pinterest for a few minutes? That thing eats time for dinner (then posts the recipe!) Hopefully the other books will be better!"
3,DalekMania!,"This collection, stiffly narrated by Peter Davison (Doctor #5) compiles interviews with author Terry Nation and designer Ray Cusick to reveal how the Daleks were created. Also in the mix are some on-air promos, clips from the first Dalek stories, and the only remaining episodes of ""Evil of the Daleks"" and ""The Dalek Masterplan."" These are especially entertaining. But one could have wished for a more thorough exploration of ""DalekMania,"" the wave of popularity the metal monsters enjoyed, as well as information on the two Dalek feature films starring Peter Cushing. On the whole, however, an invaluable additon to any ""WHO"" fan's library."
4,Daleks-the earky years,"""Exterminated""! The classic battle cry of one of the famous villains in sci-fi history. Daleks-The Early Years captivate how the monsters' first appearence in science fiction's longest running show Doctor Who. With this videos wonderful narration by the Fifth Doctor himself Peter Davidson. The documentory features interviews by Daleks creator Terry Nation. Daleks designer Raymond P. Cusacks and also features surviving episodes of stories like The Daleks' Masterplan, Power of the Daleks and The Evil of the Daleks. Complete eipsodes that no longer exist to the public eye. I highly recommend this wonderful docmentary to all Doctor Who fans new and old."
4,innovative and insightful ideas,"Thomason has already established a reputation in the area of contact linguistics, the sorts of changes that occur when speakers of different languages come into close contact with each other. This book contains several new proposals, including an emphasis on the various possibilities that can (and cannot) result from ""incomplete learning"". She also proposes some new hypotheses, but is careful to note which proposals are such speculative thinking and which are based on more evidence and thought. There is much here for any linguist that examines the results of language contact, whether student or established scholar."
1,A comprehensive description of language contact,"Language Contact by S. Thomason makes an increasingly relevant subject, what happens to two languages when their speakers are bilingual and in contact, available to a wide audience. However, it reads too much like a rehash of parts of the 1988 Thomason and Kaufman book (Language contact,creolization, and genetic linguistics. Furthermore, it is largely descriptive when attempts at providing explanations (theoretical frameworks) as well would make the book more useful."
4,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed The Changeling Bride! Cach creates very believable characters. And against all odds, she makes the magical, time travel story 'logical.' I really enjoy time travel romances, and I highly recommend this book to readers with similar tastes."
4,"Fun, Enjoyable Read","I don't read a lot of time travel, but this one intrigued me. It's the story of Elle, who gets a magic coupon and wishes for a husband. Unbeknownst to her fairies hear her request and take over. She thinks it's just a joke but when she's transported back to the 1790's on the verge of her wedding she realizes it's not.If you want a quick enjoyable light read this is the one. There are some very humorous scenes with Elle trying to use her future knowledge to make life easier.The one scene where she's trying to ride side-saddle was absolutely hilarious. I started laughing so much I had tears running down my cheeks.The hero Henri tries very hard to be supportive and kind. He thinks she's a little nutty but is never mean to her.Also the ending when she tries to let her family know what happened to her was really great.Enjoy this book for what it is a light, funny, time travel.Suzanne"
1,Stick in a Pumkin,"Sure, I get it. Get a box of that magnetic poetry stuff. stick the pieces inside a pumpkin and shake it all up. Tip the pumpkin upside down. Now make a poem (try to sound southern and rural). No, that's never been done before. yeah, this alphabet soup rates a billion stars. I can't wait for girlfriend poem # 814. Or a best friends series of hardhitting poems."
2,Not his best.,"The device of having a lot of the action told in flashback from the police interviewing room was pretty interesting. Other than that, it's your basic YA Horror/Mystery without Pike's usual signature paranormal element."
3,"a thrilling,suspenseful love triangle",I liked this book a lot.Christopher Pike is one of the masters of suspense.Its love triangle plot and you never know whats goingto happen next. I recommendthis book to people who dont want to put it down till the end.
2,This is probably the worse book I have ever read from Pike,I normally love Christopher Pike's books. I have read every single book he has written and this one was totally predictabe. It wasn't scary and you really didn't like any of the characters in the book. I would not reccomend this book to any avid Christopher Pike fan.
1,This book is a poor example of his writing.,"I did not enjoy reading this book in the least, which is a stark contrast from his other works. It lacks a certain twist and unpredictably usually present in his writings. I think the story line could have been better developed and more action scenes added. If you are a fan of Christopher Pike's books, I highly recommend that you not buy this one."
1,So-so......,"This book really looked like it was thrown together in fifteen minutes. I could have dug that story right out of the septic tank. The ending, in particular, was bad. Hannah's reasoning had not been foreshadowed at all, and it was just bad.... Keep in mind this is my opinion, so don't let one- honest- bad review stop you."
1,Only Wrong Format available,"Unfortunately only Region 1 available, thogh this was not obvious from advert and product details"
2,Carole King album,"I was disappointed with this. It is mostly new songs. I did enjoy her demonstrating how you compose new songs, but I'm sorry I didn't purchase one of her earlier albums with the familiar songs.Tapestry would have been more my cup of tea."
2,Disappointed!,Not the Carole King I used to know. It's time to retire and not spoil a good reputation.
2,Dissappointing!,"Okay, so I'm a big fan of Carole's.....bit did I really need to hear her give the audience a backstory on all her songs. I found this very irritating, and it took me completely out of the concert. With the amount of time she took to describe each piece, she could of added more music. It was kind of putting me to sleep.I was really expecting a lot more.The quality of the sound was just so-so.I need to be more careful with future reviews of concert dvds."
4,Carole King: 20th Century Pop Genius Performs Live,"If you weren't lucky enough to catch Carole King's sold out 2004 and 2005 ""Living Room Tour,"" you can experience the magic by purchasing this DVD. From the opening number, ""Song of Long Ago"" to her jazz/lounge version of ""The Loco-motion,"" most of her hits are performed here including a fun-filled Goffin/King medley. In total command of the stage, she's at the top of her live performance game on this DVD. She looks and sounds great; Rudy Guess and Nashville-based Gary Burr lend great musical support. But, when all is said and done, the true star of this DVD is Carole King, alone at her piano, doing what she's been doing for over 40 years -- connecting to a world-wide audience, as if, she's singing to you directly, in her living room. Welcome, indeed."
5,Powerful!,"I don't have time to read these days with family and career pressures, so the idea of an Audiobook was pretty appealing. I had the opportunity to hear Blanche on a radio interview and I was impressed. More than anything she seemed to know what she was talking about. I bought her Audiobook and I'm blown away by the way she breaks things down and helps me understand what I really can do in my life. I listen to it constantly and always seem to get a little more out each time. Oh, my husband and my daughter have borrowed it on occasion. The workbook that goes along with it was even more powerful when I made the commitment to really do the work for myself, by myself. Anyway, I recommend it highly for people like me who need the motivation, but also need the steps to take. The rest is up to me."
1,Poor example of what a role playing game is,"If you want to play a role playing game save your money and buy one of the playstation's other gems like FF9 or Chrono Cross because you will not find it here. I will not deny that Final Fantasy 8 is beautiful but is simply that... eye candy. The game play was fidgity at best and the story line was not only hard to follow but pointless. Even after beating the game I was left wondering ...WHY???. Unlike the other Final Fantasy's there was no definate villian, no real hero (squall was quite abusive to the heroine) and no real challenge. Just as seven the hardest boss was an optional boss that you could pick not to fight and get the same ending. I am really disappointed that squaresoft have begun publishing interactive novels and altered away from what used to be the greatest RPG franchise. If you want to taste a real Role Playing Game pick up Final Fantasy Anthologies."
1,Why is this called Final Fantasy?,"I'm still amazed that this was ever titled Final Fantasy. It should have been titled something else. Where Final Fantasy VII pushed the edge with technology a little this game dove head long over it. This game, although graphicly beautiful, lacks both engaging characters and a decent plot. FFVIII also includes a magic system that takes over the game. You will spend more time drawing magic than anything else in this game. What was expected of this game and what was delivered are two very different things. I, like many others, would like nothing more than for this game to go away. get FFIX you will be much happier if you're like me and have enjoyed all of the FF series from the very beginning. Although if you are into eye candy and have more time and money than you know what to do with by all means buy this game."
1,This is for those who like interactive movies,"So where in the world did the STOry element go for FFVIII? my scores:Graphics-Five stars. These are the best graphics ever in an RPG. Fantastic.Story-one star. Two major villains are developed great in the first two discs. Then, they disappear. Seifer rocks. But where did he go? Once you see the ending, you'll know what I mean.Characters-two stars. I hated them. The plot was too focused on Squall, Rinoa, and love. They all but eliminated the rest of the cast.Fun-FIVE STARS! What makes it so fun is Triple TRiad, the card game. It is obsessive. Otherwise, it stinks. i died twice in the entire four discs. Beat it in 1 1/2 months. once you get every card, GF, and all stats maxed, there's nothing else to do but Omega."
1,A Macy's RPG?!?,"I am the type of RPG gamer who likes to chop heads off, burn down castles, pillage villages and slay dragons. I don't like to go to Macy's or Talbots and buy a blowdryer so I can fight the next cosmo-monster. This one sucks. Final Fantasy should go back to its roots and deal with a true story, like FF3, FF7 or FF9. The ending was a confused mess- good graphics, but what were the storywriters for this ending smoking? I am not chauvinistic, but this is one chick-flick game if there is any. Not for head-chopping, castle-burning, dragon-slaying guys like me. One star for the Square title and graphics."
1,If you like (...),"...you'll enjoy this game. It features one of the worst protagonsts in video game history. The plot seems more like Dawsons Creek than of a Final Fantasy game. The one cool thing was the summons, too bad you have to watch the entire thing every time you use it, quick battles turn to five minutes. Boss battles? Forget it, bring a book to read while you're waiting for the summons to finish. If you absolutely must have every FF game in existance, buy if not, get anthology with FFVI, the best FF game out there. Better yet, buy Final Fantasy Tactics."
1,very very poor packaging,"what a terribly packaged game its four discs were stuffed into two cd envelopes and forcefully put into a two disc ps1 case. you really didn't even have a 4 disc case for it come on. it was a effed up case at that. fame was over used too not ""good"" as it previewed. luckily it played cuz all i needed was to get past the opening fmv because i have all other discs in perfect conditions from 12 years ago. worst item purchased as far as conditions and package but i love the game."
3,Not Squaresoft's best,"Every Squaresoft game that comes out seems to top the last in graphics and complexity of gameplay, but loses a little in originality. This game falls short of the flawed FF7, and well short of Squaresoft's best: Crono Trigger! It's still better than most of the RPG junk out there, but just the same I'd rather spend my free time on Lunar Complete."
4,One of the best RPGs I've ever played.,"This game is really amazing. It is a thrilling story that you can play over and over again. It is really a love story filled with a lot of action, so if you don't like love stories... watch out. It has complex characters and really intense situations. The junction system is something you just have to get used to; it's bad at first, but it gets a lot better. The graphics aren't wonderful, but it is worth it to get this game, anyways. The opening is simply amazing and really hypes you up for the whole story. There are a lot of unexpected twists that I would have never guessed at the beginning, so you definitely won't be bored. It's worth the money, and the game really isn't that expensive on Amazon, so go for it. If you don't like it, you can probably sell it back for the same price you payed(or for more) somewhere since it is such a popular game. So why not try it out?"
5,Best Game in My Collection!,"Being a fairly big playstation fan, and haveing many games for it, I found Final Fantasy VIII to be one of the best. The graphics are amazing with nearly perfect backgrounds, but the characters are the only downfall. They seem to be somewhat boxy compared to the rest of the game, but don't let this disuade you. The fighting scenes are amazing, and the story line thrilling. This is a must have for any RPG fanatic!"
4,not as good as other FF games,"This game is dissapointing, In my opinion it is the worst final fantasy game ever. It is still good, but there are many flaws. For one, the GF and magic system .... It makes the game way too easy. The story isn't that great either. It is really unrealistic, I know, it's a final fantasy game, but the story is stupid. And the game gets really old. There's not that many sidequests that give you a break from battles. And plus, you can't add accessories or armor to the characters. The game is good, but if you don't have VII, IX, or anthology yet, put this game off."
5,An awesome game with stunning FMVs,"The characters are well developed, the story line is great, and the animation/graphics are awesome. Some of the FMVs (full motion videos) are simply amazing; I could just sit there and watch them over and over. ""Final Fantasy 8"" is an excellent addition to the Final Fantasy tradition. I don't remember how many hours I played this game, but every single minute was worth it; I wasn't bored once. One thing I really liked about this game was that the final battle could actually be kind of challenging; especially the first time you try when you have no idea what is going to happen. This game was a lot of fun, and I would recommend it to any fan of the series."
2,"Nice anime, not much else.","Pros: beautiful, anime-level graphics; has a plot.Cons: Constant and painfully tedious battles; baroque ""junctioning"" system; adolescent anime-level plot; stereotypic characters; pervasive sexism; Shiva as an easily defeatable ""friend""/helper; wimpy T-Rex.I enjoyed Final Fantasy I on the GameBoy ""classic"" more. Try Max Payne or Duke Nukem instead."
3,"Not as good as FF7, but good enough","I like this game, it's really good... but it's got a bad main character... Squall. I really don't like him... he sorta gets better toward the end, but over-all, no. And Selphie is too hyper and annoying. However, I liked Rinoa. Along with a just-ok cast of charcters, the storyline wasn't the best either. It's good at first, and the Time Compresiion, but it turns into a kind-of love story, so you if you don't like love stories (which I don't, really) it will be disapointing. However, it's got a nice new battle system, with GFs (Guardian Forces) and they have their own HP! Also, there is no MP, which is my favorite thing of the game I think... to get magic you just draw amounts from monsters or draw points. The FMVs are really great too, there are lots more in this one than there is in FF7 and 9. I would suggest this game for gamers, but go for FF7 and 9 first if you want something more thrilling."
3,So-So,"I liked this game enough, I guess. The plot was tepid, but the graphics were super-duper. I'll choose a plot and character development over graphics any day. My guy friends say it's because I'm a chick, what ever. ...."
5,The king of Final Fantasy's,"Final Fantasy! Doesn't hearing that name give you a chill down your back? Well, if not, then you haven't played number 8. I thought seven was pretty darn good but I was wrong. It is average compared to the mighty FF8. I am twelve and love PS games but this is incredible. Here is my score for it: Graphics: 10/10 Absolutely incredible! This would be good even on PS2 Gameplay: 10/10 Come on! It's Final Fantasy! Lifespan: 10/10 4 discs! 100+ hrs. What more can be said? Sound: 9/10 The best FF music yet. Brill! Characters: 10/10 Couldn't fault any of them Plot: 10/10 Better than FF7! Awesome.Even Metal Gear Solid isn't as good as this! This is a master piece: Perecentage of 100 for ff fans and 99 for none ff fans. Exceptional! Magnificent! Magic! I could go on...."
4,This is a pretty good game,"FF8 is a real cool game i liked it. i don't like rpg's that much but i liked FF8. the only bad thing is it gets confusing at some parts in the game, but except for that it is a blast! with great graphics and a pretty good plot. so i give this game a 4, if you dont like rpg's give this game a try."
2,Beware the Greatest Hits edition!,"I loved this game, but I and many people I knew, had problems with the final disk of this version of the game on the Playstation 2.I am lucky I could hunt someone down with an original copy of the last disk and finish the game, but it was a pain."
4,Great Classic Fun RPG,"The overall condition of this game was immaculate, the discs were pristine and the booklets were clean as a whistle. the only thing wrong with mine is the cover was cracked but no damage to the game whatsoever. i bought it used on a friday had it to me by a tuesday the following week.Great Game for a Great Price"
3,OK for RPG fans,"A lot of elements in FFVIII are pretty creative. The storyline, as in most FF games, is award-winning good. The graphics are good for its time, and the customizing system (Junctioning) is really innovative and simple to use. Music is really nice also, as well as the sound. But still, not among Square's best Final Fantasy games. This game tends to be almost too easy through the story, but getting some things is really hard (e.g. getting Malboro Tentacles for Doomtrain. I really hate Malboros!!!). Also, junctioning makes the game even easier than it normally is, which makes it less and less fun to play, and the card game is addicting, but silly. But nevertheless a good game."
5,king of all game!!!!!!,"i just like to say this game is a one of a kind! no matter how many games i play this game will always be my favorite!, the characters look really cool like the sharpshooter or the gunbladeist.this game has superior gameplay and mindblowing grahics You wont be able to put it down!!!"
3,Final Fantasy VIII-A new era,"Ouch, only three stars from this reviewer. FF8 was amazing graphic-wise, and it opened the door for a few new ideas such as the card game which was included, and the pocket station edition to it. The cinemas were astounding, as were the graphics, the amount of game play was great, but besides all that it wasn't the best Final Fantasy I ever played. Plot wasn't to think, to much of a ""once upon a time"" romance, music didn't impress me, and the villains had no reasoning behind their insanity and they had poo poo personality. Good for a avid fan, you might as well play it to waste and few good 20-80 hours of your life."
2,Buy FF7 Instead,This game is terrible compared to Final Fantasy 7. The only better part is the graphics (which is why I give it a 2) and the stupid junction system is confusing. I only keep this game because I'm only missing two of the FF series. I like the MP better than the GFs because you still get the same guys like Ifrit in FF7 with MP. I highly reccomend FF7.
2,Great Graphics and perhaps a good story but terrible game,"Many of the concepts in this game are good (like Summons with levels and HP and customizable attacks) but the GFs (the summons)are the reason I give this game a bad rating. You have to use them pretty much every battle, and they are long and make you hold select and repeatingly press the square button. They never seem to die either so battle seem very long, very boring and very easy. The only good side of the game is the great graphics, but it cant save this game"
5,Amazing.,"This is doubtlessly one of the finest games I have ever played. The gameplay is excellent, and the newly introduced junctioning system lets you really customize your characters the way you want them. The graphics and CG sequences are gorgeous, visually Squaresoft has taken a huge step forward from Final Fantasy VII. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, whether you have played any other FF titles or not."
5,Love it!,"So, I've played this game since it first came out. I absolutely love it. I have played a bunch of the final fantasy games and this has always been one of my favorites. I recommend this to anyone. It's fun and very time consuming. Although the video at the front and everything is a little boring and you can't skip it. Since I first began playing it's never been hard, but I guess that depends on the person also. The boss battles can be difficult if you haven't leveled up enough. When I first start the game I find it better to level up as much as possible before I fight the first boss. I spend like 3 hours just leveling up so that it's easier to win in battles. Junctioning can be complicated at the very beginning, but after you get the hang of it it's no problem. The storyline is great. Well, I can't think of anything else right now. I hope this helps at least a little bit."
4,One of my favorites!,This was one of my favorite Final Fantasy games that I played during high school. I bought this as a birthday present for someone and I was surprised how fast I received it. Amazon is amazing!
2,Not up to par,"Look I'm one of Final Fantasy's greatest fans but this game really stunk. Compared to other Final Fantasy's it seemed somewhat shabby. The story line was confusing, there was only a few good songs in it and there were not enough side quests. However it did have excellent graphics and many random battles which some people like. I just think that unless you are a die-hard Final Fantasy fan like me you should go out and buy Final Fantasy 7 or even better Final Fantasy 3 (6)."
3,Do not expect too much in story/character development.,"I have bought and played ALOT of Squaresoft games, in fact I am quite the Square fan. However this game seemed rather hastily compiled. I have always respected the company for treating storyline and character development to the utmost expectations. This was not the case in FF8. Although the game contributes alot of eye candy, the other elements seemed to have been ignored. To me, a well made story and strong characters is the main course. Relations between each character seemed rather distant and the development of the love between Squall and Rinoa a disappointment. Although these elements aren't as strong as previous FFs (such as FF3(US) and FF7)it is a game worthy to buy due to its ground breaking FMVs and the fact that it does take RPGs (graphic wise) to the next level."
5,A Beautiful Story,"This game has truly shown me how great games can be. Not only was the gaming and graphics (for its time, it was the best) great, the story line was the most beautiful story I've ever watched.Watching the end brought painful tears that seemed to burn not just my cheeks but melted my heart. I was so touched.It's true when SQUARESOFT had said, ""The Ultimate Game."" They were not bragging.This game has set a standard for me as what RPGs should be. What's sad is that I'll probably always be dissatisfied with all other RPGs because the story line just could never compare.Two thumbs up to Squaresoft.wbcfox"
4,"Good story, bit of a problem with the game design.","Don't get me wrong, this game is very good. This is the best game I've played in a long time. This game introduced me to the wonder that is Final Fantasy. I love the story, but I disliked the way the game was done. I disliked the draw system, I disliked the weapons upgrading system, but most of all, I hated the rediculious side quests. There are way too many, and you can't get the best GFs or items without completing them. Huge pain. Overall, though, I enjoyed the game."
3,Its good but gets kinda boring,"well,at first, i loved this game.the graphics are great.I sorta didnt like the new ""junction"" system. i like the Final Fantasy 7 straight out ""materia"" and ""equip"" not this.All in all,this game was fun but sorta futuristic. i mean i played all through it the first time. but the second time i played it was because i didn't have any other games in the house and i was bored.AN OKAY GAME"
4,Awesome game!,This game is so fun! But it doesn't match up to Final Fantasy X at all. I even think Final Fantasy IX is funner but not by much. My favorite person is Zell because he punches the enemies with leather gloves with metal plates on them. Buy soon!
3,A great game if its the first RPG youv ever played.......,"Final fantasy VIII was the first video game I got when I got my Play station one december of 00. At the time, I thought it was great....and im probably one of the only pepole in the world who actually likes the main character. I put it in and thought, WOW! I didnt know the Play station was capable of such beutifull envirnments. I loved the game. Though, as I got farther into it, I liked it less and less. Especialy since I had gotten a few more games by the time I beat it. By the time I beat it, I felt that the game was no wear nearly as good as when I first played it....I feal its a good game, but there are better out there....get final fantasy IX"
4,Pretty Good Game,"This game is pretty good. But in my opinion, it is not as good as Final Fantasy VII. FFVII's storyline and endurance were much better for me! I'll just say, this is not the kind of game that you would want to play for like more than two times. But I'll have to admit, the graphics and movies in FFVIII is a lot better than that of FFVII. (The characters are much better looking.) Overall, this is a pretty good RPG game. But if you're planning to buy this game and you have already played FFVII, you might be disappointed. But if you don't own FFVII already, BUY THEM BOTH!!! (I suggest you play VIII first though, save the best for the end) These are great for the collection of great RPG kicks!!!"
3,not as good as ff7,"i liked playing this game when it just came out, but i only played it once. i played final fantasy VII on the other hand 20 times. this is my least favorite final fantasy.the things i liked least were how i made it to level 100 before i was half way through the game. it was stupid. after that all the game was was fighting boss battles and advancing in the plot.junctioning (equiping magic) was possibly the worst idea ever. the penalties outweighed the benefits by like 1,000,000 to 1. if you junctioned anything you would lose like 1,000 hp.the final battles were a joke to. all you needed to do was cast Aura (infinite limit breaks until it wears off) on every body and then use a holy war (invincibility) and squall will keep doing lionheart like 10 times and then you cast aura again. that was really [boring].but despite those drawbacks ff8 was still reasonably fun. at least the beginning was. so i recommend you rent it before you buy just to make sure that your not wasting money."
5,Awsome history back,This is a game I've been looking to complete my collection for FF in playstationn. So far it didn't failed to be entretaining and captive as the others have been. It is a must.
4,replenishing stolen library,Glad to finally get this one back. I used to have a huge collection of PS1 games but a little traveling mixed with friends who have slim wallets...well you get the idea.
2,not original,"Square Soft usually out do them self with their final fantasy games. Final Fantasy VIII was boring and didn't compare to the rest of square soft's final fantasy master peices. Thought the picture was amazing and the characters did have character, the plot could have been made by a two year old. Hopefully Square Soft will learn not to create such games that are much to based on sci-fi and move towards fantasy. After all, the game is FINAL FANTASY!"
2,Final Fantasy is dead.,"When people ask, ""Why do you hate this! "", they have obvoiusly not played any REAL Final Fantasy games. In my opinion, Final Fantasy died when 7 was released. Now, the franchise is popular only because of the graphics. ONLY. Was Final Fantasy 1, 4, or 6 (1, 2, and 3 in the US) THIS popular? NO. Pretty graphics had to draw players in. The story is ok, but corny here and there. Moving on the map screen is SLOOOOWW, with that floating Balamb thing. The story gets boring around the beginning of the 3rd CD, where you are just wandering here and there. Buy it if you like RPGs, but if you want to see the real Final Fantasy, buy the Final Fantasy Anthology. It is a MASTERPIECE."
2,Worth the Money?,"well, as a teen, i think this game was extremely boring, rarely do you get to do stuff, and what you do get to do i found really frustrating, too often do you fight random battles when your trying to get somewhere, and the fading between parts of the place your in gets really annoying, i would not recomend this game, unless you have lots of time, i've spent hours trying to get somewhere, and am often times bored out of my mind, i'm sure it will get better, but right now, it just sits in my game folderhope this will be helpful"
3,Low Point in Series,"I love the Final Fantasy series, but this is definately the worst one, in my opinion (7 is the best). It has a pretty good story, but you have to Draw magic from your opponents, and it's just pretty lame. I guess it's worth the 20 bucks to have this in your collection, but any other Final Fantasy title is better."
4,Good game,"Granted, this game is not the greatest of the final fantasy series, but it is definately not getting the justice that it deserves. In had a very unique concept of involving schools in the plot, the outstanding graphics and allowing ""summons"" called GF's to fight along with you. The game was rather easy and the plot sort of dragged along, but I am a total FF fan all the way, and i was not disappointed. I'm glad that it drifted from the typical FF style to become a little more unique and memorable. Also, it wasn't childish, like FF9, and it wasn't depressing, like FF7 (which is one of the best FF games of all time, still). I think this is one of the better FF games, if you dont mind the simplicity, and people need to give this game more credit, because even though it had alot to live up to, it deserves it."
1,WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING?!?!?!,"This game is a peice of crap! I dunno what happnened, VII was without a doubt the BEST RPG I have ever played (I haven't played any of the earlier ones though). Whoever came up with the idea for this game should be killed. Flat, emotionless, lifeless, boring, uninspired characters with bad attitudes and a lame main protagonist AND antagonist top it all off. It is a cheap, sell out mainstream game that is so horrible, I don't even know where to start. It has good graphics and cool cinematic sequences, but that is ALL. Bad plot, bad characters, bad battle system, reused, recycled plots that aren't even good ones, and so boring there is seemingly no end in sight. So you should just go home, there is nothing to see here, and if it weren't for the genuine amazingness (?) of IX I would never have even thought to return to the series."
1,Sux,"It's way too hard! I've tried to get evrything i can, i can't get Squall's Lionheart, that stupid Sorceress Adel always kills me (or rinoa) AUGGHHHHHHH! The only thing i like about this game is the music score (thank you Nobuo Uematsu) Everything else sucks. Do not buy this game!!"
3,Junctions??,"This is a pretty fun game, but overall, i did not like it that much. I found that it was harder to level up and the junction system of magic was very confusing. It also starts out very slow. But after a while, it picks up the pace a little bit."
3,"Good, but dissapointed","I thought that this game was really good, for it's element. But the dissapointing part is that Fianl Fantasy VIII wasn't all that it was advertised and said to be... The game isn't even a fantasy, it takes place in the future, and the missions all involve some sort of scifi plot, for instance, go into space, stop a laser, etc. The battles are really boring, and very basic. Click is all you really do at all. The magic system was dissapointing as well. I beat this game in 30 hours, so i would suggest renting it, and not buying it."
2,Horrible,"Maybe its cause I hate RPG games, but Final Fantasy 8 to me is bad. The graphics are very nice, but the game is boring. If your like me (you don't like RPG games)and you think you'll like this one, you won't."
4,If this game weren't a Final Fantasy...,"...wouldn't we all like it a lot better? What's in a name, ne? All Final Fantasies have to be the most severely nitpicked/criticized RPGs in existence. Even though technically none of them are sequels to eachother, they're reviewed as harshly as if it was an ongoing saga. It sort of is, I guess, but jeez! Lighten up, people! How would you have liked Xenogears if it had been called FF8, or FF8 if it had been called ""The Sorceress Rescue"" or something equally inane? This isn't exactly a review, but I liked the game. It had its merits and flaws, though. Mix VI with VII and VIII, and you might just have the perfect game...but no one else's games have to be perfect, why should Square's?"
1,"Buy FF7, this one's a piece of junk.","This gamehas to be the worst FF yet. Characters have absolutely no personality what so ever, The story is so cheesy and linear it makes you want to puke, the music is absolutely stuid, the graphics are okay, the only thing that this game is almost good at. Save some money and buy a game worth your money. Buy FF7 instead."
1,the dog dodo realy hit the fan now,"ok, I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game, but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to $19.99 before I wasted almost $50.00 for it. I hope Square makes FF9 better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap shoot.Now for my reasons for the 1 star.1. It was a rip off of FF7. if you want to get FF8 but havent played FF7 get FF7.2. Why no voice acting! I sooooooo recomend it! C'mon Square at least on the CG movies(pease let FF9 have voice acting)!3. The characters in the game not just the playable ones but all of them seem to have no life to them, its just boring how the characters are so dull, I just cant explain it.4. Rushed, rushed, rushed, and, rushed. C'mon Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that.5. I dont have anough time to tell you the rest but there is alot of other stuff."
1,Square's Great Mistake..........,"First off let me say that I love the Final Fantisy series. But FFVIII has an extreme rushed feel to it. Yes some say it is the ""greatest game of all time"" but that is just probly the funniest thing I ever heard. To begin, the whole game is just boring, nothing to me really happens, and I expect alot more from square. All that is great about this game is the videos, that is all. If you want my advise, wait untill FFX because IX will be even more rushed than VIII."
1,Graphics: 100 Fun: 0,"I'm a gamer since the TRS80, and Final Fantasy was one of my best ''less-eat-and-less-sleep=more-play'' title. Games used to be a MIND candy. Unfortunately, not anymore...All we think about is effects, 3d, textures, polygons...What about good ol' fun? And gameplay?Sorry, but this Final Fantasy has nothing but graphics..."
1,"Well, it was boring..","I can't quite figure it out. but some how this game just doesnt stack up. its got good grafics. and the story line is involved. but its just NOT FUN... it seems that attacks, and normal magic realy dont hit hard. if you want to kill somthing you almost HAVE to use your GF and they get REALY old to watch.. i played it though to the end but all i can say is i wouldnt buy it again. and i dont think ill be replaying any time soon. as far as replay value its about 0! no match for ff2 or 3. the 2 best ;)"
4,This game isn't for the simple minded!!,"I'm going to try and make this as ""simple"" as I can. If you're looking for a challenging game where you might have to use your brain, try FF8. If your brain is easily tickled by childish and boring games, try FF7.......Simple Enough?"
5,READ THIS PLEASE,"Whats wrong with you people; putting down this RPG is a sin against the RPG god.(who lives somewhwere in rpg land.) Ive heard all the complaints;bad story, bad characters,not like the regular final fantasys, and the worst one is , oh no its not a regular rpg they're actually trying something new, I cant play this. Back in the day when nes came out and the first final fantasy came out , they were trying something new, when FF7 came out they were trying something new, god forbid they should ever do it again. You people just dont give this game a chance. The junction sytem works perfectly, but half of you are too blown away by the direction sqaure took with this game that you dont even care to figure it out so you think its a bad magic system. Heres a tip, play the game again and this time, give it a chance. It has the best music of all the FF's, best graffics, and a great story too which has clever twists in it. So play it one more time......."
2,Nice older game but product quality not so nice.,"If you like the Final Fantasy series, or RPG's in general, then you will probably enjoy this game. This game was just before voices become common on games, but other than that, it has all the basic ingredients of a good RPG.Unfortunately, as previous reviewers have commented on, I got a game where the 4th disc will not play and won't be recognized by the console. I can't give a good game review if I can't play the game. By the time I played to the 4th disc, the warranty had run out so I had no chance of getting a refund."
4,For my Son,"This game was bought for my son and he loves it! The product arrived quickly, the order was easy to make and he is having a blast."
5,BEST FINAL FANTASY GAME OF ALL TIME!,"First of all, don't listen to all those people who say ""Final Fantasy 7 is much better"". IT ISN'T! Second, The storyline is fantastic, along with the graphics, and sound. Once I've started to play this, I was glued! Sorry, gotta cut this short because I gotta do homework."
5,Another classic,"This game is not quite as good as Final Fantasy 7, but it is great game, just buy it and enjoy. I pesonally played through it twice the first time on my own, and the second time using the Official guide book, it was great both times through."
2,Ehh.....,I was so phsced when I herd that there was a Finial Fantasty VIII. OK so there was a bunce of flashy graphics. BIG DEAL. True FF players should agree with me. The story line was not deep enough. Another problem is the way theyhave the magic system. Drawing magic come on... Magic should be learned or gained by a certin item. What happened to armor and accessories. No all we get now is the Gaurdian forces (which I think are stupid but have way cool cut scenes) Squaresoft should have stayed along the long the lines of FFVII which is a much better game with a much deeper story line.I know it sounds like I'm really dishing FF VIII but all in all its not such a bad game I just think that if you really want true RPG stick to Finial Fantasty 7 and Finial Fantasty 6
2,Didn't there use to be a plot to Final Fantasy?,"Very beautiful graphics make this game look awesome at first sight. But to the real gamers who were patiently waiting for Square's next Final Fantasy Epic this was not worth it. First of all what ever happened to all the weapons and equipment? Where ever they went they need to desperately be added back. The guardian force idea didn't seem that smooth either, it was much better being materia and having to equip it. Another thing is the sound tracks and story plot. This game is one of the worst Final fantasy games yet in these two factors. And what happened to an entriquing plot? Who wrote this game's plot anyway? This is definately a decline from Final fantasy VII. I beat FFVIII just because it was there. It definately lacked the interest and attention that the rest of the series could easily hold on to."
3,It's a classic!!,Final Fantasy VIII is an awesome game. It's a classic game. The cinematics are awesome. The game itself is vast(4 discs). The only sad part of the playing this game is turning it off. I give it 2 thumbs up!
3,[4 Stars] One of the best entries in the series.,"Meant to give this 4 stars. A lot of FF7 junkies like to pound on this game, and I can understand why; the junction system really is strange-- it's honestly an annoyance, so I have no idea what Squaresoft was thinking when they designed it. On the other hand, everything else is just too good to pass up -- the story and characters really hit the mark for me, and Squall is one of the most interesting protagonists I've come across in an RPG. Be open minded and don't pass this up -- this is Squares last great effort."
5,A game that fell from heaven itself,"Ok, one, this game does not deserve 5 stars it deserves 10, this game is the best game ever made. Adventure, action , and romance. If you are looking at my review and you dont have this game, then i strongly advise you to go to your local wal-mart and buy, may this game go on and on, because it did for me, i feel as though this game changed my life with its love and excitment, trust me. Oh and if you happened to beat the game wait till after the credits theirs a big excitment your in for, who knows maybe youll cry alittle , well anyway, this game is basicly starts off when your a Balamb Garden, your a student their named Squall,a student that dosent want to get along or love, find out about squall, youll thank me on day for buying this game because it is simply, the best game ever mad."
4,Like the game,"So some of you might not think the game so cool but I like it alot. I remember buying it on a friday night, I wasn't a big fan of video games or anything, I never finished a game before this one. When I came home that night, I placed the discs near my dusty old game system (playstation --as I said I wasn't into gaming business before--) and I waited until the next evening to try it. When I saw the beginning movie I went like this ----------> (*o*) and the look on my face when I finished the game was even wilder. The graphics, the movies, the story....everything was amazing. So cool. It's even the first game that I finished without any help (so I did finish my brother's Zelda64 once, but I made my brother fight a couple of bosses, finish a couple of stages ---so I lack gaming skills). But Final Fantasy VIII is so special. Now I'm on the look out for the next squaresoft release. I actually stand in the shop with a baseball glove awaiting to catch the next game."
5,Final Fantasy VIII,"This is more than a game...it's an adventure playing it!It's the best game I ever played. It has an epic love story and when you start playing it, you are not going to be able to stop.The storyline is one of the strongest features of this game because it is's very romantic and extremly real. It's so good that I would like to be in the game:)"
4,What do people hate about this?,"I can't see how people hate this game as compared to others. I've played through it many times, and still enjoy it. I will admit that it won't beat 6 or 7, as it DOES seem more like a movie than a game. But if that's the case, it's a damn good movie. Great graphics, unforgettable storyline, nice battles. The magic system was pretty bad, and there IS too much focus on the Guardian Forces, but I didn't give it such a good review for hype. People love Final Fantasy for a reason."
2,What went wrong between VII and VIII ?,"After I had beaten Final Fantasy VIII, I couldn't wait to try the next game. When I started the game, the beginning movie was cool, but when it came to the actual gameplay, it was not worth what little I payed for it. The graphics are worse than the last game, and you can barely see the figures. The plot doesn't make much sense, and it makes the game not even worth playing. The battle and menu system is so complicated, that the tutorials will make you fall asleep. What I'm wondering is how this game can have absolutely no meaning to it while thae last one was kick-butt. If you don't believe me, try the game yourself (for your own sake, rent it)."
4,A different Kind of Final Fantasy,"I will say after playing Final Fanasty 6 and 7 that this game didn't have that impact on me as the previous two did, however, this game was well above average of a game. What makes this game better than any of the Final Fantasy titles is the ending. I'll admit that it's ending is the best ending to any game I have ever seen. The game is worth owning."
5,"Great Game, Fast Service.. One Problem...",I was very satisfied about ordering this product. It arrived quickly and was cheaper. I only have one issue with the service though; I bought two of them and both were Greatest Hits versions but the display is clearly the black label. Kind of false advertising but I guess its ok. Thanks for the fast service though.
5,one of my favorite games and at a great price,the final fantasy series is my favorite game series always a great story line and always fun
3,It was okay,"This game is a pretty good game and i've had it ever since it came out a while, good graphics, fun RPG, although i didn't really like all of the random battles because it was usually the same type of battle over and over again. Also, if you don't train and level up the right characters and abilities you could end up like i did having to restart from close to the beginning. Although the starting over kinda ruined my experience, it was a decent game."
4,Final Fantasy VIII,"My order was in perfect condition, but a little late. I love the game, it has kept me intertained for hours on end. I can barely put down the controller. One down-side is that there are too many fights with fiends when you are walking from town to town. The storyline is incredible and gripping. I recommend it for anyone with an imagination."
3,Disapointing to Final Fantasy Fans,"After waiting, and waiting, and waiting some more for the next game in the Final Fantasy series, I eagerly snatched up Final Fantasy VIII when as soon as it was available. Then, being a college student, I had to make myself wait until after finals to play it. And after all the waiting, I sat down to play a game that just never caught my interest at all. I made it to the second disk, but no farther. Maybe it gets really good after that!The graphics are really nice, and the combat is just like FF VII."
5,The best game out there,"This game is so great, I can't see anyone not liking it. The story is awesome, the characters are the best in any game and the battle system is really great too. All those dumb people pointing out every little problem, like drawing spells get's boring, stop complaning, the other millions of great moments make up for it. The one flaw I found was that the game was a bit easy to beat, but with all the side-quests, it will keep you with the controller for a while. Awesome game, get it right now"
4,A stunning RPG,From begin to end this was simply a good game. Like any game it had it's annoying points and it dragged and the draw system was bad. There was also the fact that you had to depend on your GF. Other than that it was a great game. The CG was breathtaking the story line was wonderful.I really enjoyed the Characters. They were more human than most FF characters. You could relate to. I thought that Squall displayed many human fears and emontions. Many people had a hard time solving this game. I didn't It wasn't easy but I didn't need a walkthrough or anything to finish it. I think if you played any FF game before(I've been playing game since FF2 on super nes ). then it should have beem pretty easy to figure out. The outcome of this game was very stunning and very worth while. I would recomd this game to any FF fan
4,Why do so many people say it's bad?,"I don't think that this is a bad game. I've heard people rail about the non-SD characters, the junction system, and the storyline. The fact that the characters aren't SD shouldn't matter if you've played and liked Chrono Cross, and while the junction system takes some time getting used to, there is the auto-junction system for you lazy people--heck, I've used it a couple times where I just want to make sure I'm good to go just in case something pops up in the storyline that I don't have time to prepare for. The storyline is really pretty good, if a little hard to understand at first--there are something like 40 plot twists on disk 2 in one location alone. Don't believe any reviewers, just buy the game--the worst that can happen is that you're out about 25 bucks--and play it."
4,a great game with a few flaws,"thing thing i liked alot about it is that itwasnt as typical as other rpg's. I LOVED the ideas of the gardens and SeeD. Whoever came up with this game must have been very creative. Thee charecters personalitys were great and you could really ge mad at the villans. The problems with this game are, they tried too hard in the graphics for that time and are very messy, the game freezes up easily and it is too hard to level up so the bosses are ussually much too strong for your party. I should have givin it five stars but for that i want it perfect :)"
2,Worst in the series,"I love video games. It takes alot for me not to like one, but this one makes into that hard to get region. Just about the only good thing I can say about this game is the graphics. I started the game several times, and I have to get a hang of the magic and GF systems. These have confused me beyond possibility, I don't understand how people can like it. On the next page, the storyline, a love story, if you want a love story, go to the movies, this is Final Fantasy. Also the character development is very shallow, unlike in Final Fantasy 7 when you care about the characters, and feel bad when Aries dies. It get's 2 stars for good graphics. If you want a good RPG, get FF7, FF5, Chrono Trigger, or Xenogears."
5,FF what,"I just bought this game yesterday and it rocks. The CG look just like the ones from FF X. The only bad thing is the control in the game, But I still give it five stars. Cards are pretty fun except it starts to get more boring.I would Have to say this game isn't as good as FF X For PS2, which may I add is the best console out there,But it's really close.If you do not have this game i'm telling you now to get of your lazy [bottom] and go get it.Put down that pop and ... get the game!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,bulls eye!,"square really out did itself this time, this game really is just a advanced version of FF7 in some areas, but still has it's flaws, for instance: Squall, acts exactly like cloud from FF7 except a little colder... Rinoa, except for the blonde streaks on the sides of her head... exactly like tifa. Zell.............. is flawless his attitude, the ""i'm too ignorant but i'm still gonna beat the crap outta you."" personality, has never been introduced in the final fantsy series before so his characters personality is perfect. Zell's clothes... very well designed, the shorts, the vest, the muscle shaped breast plate armor, his shoes.....great but too much red for me. Zell, next to Cloud of FF7, and Crono of Chrono trigger takes first place above all other final fantasy characters........later"
4,Great Story,"I have to say I just played this game through, in a week span. But after I started, I couldn't put it down. At work I found myself thinking about the story line and wondering what would happen next. I totally got into the theme, and what amazed me the most was the emotional feelings of sadness, pressure and others I'm not willing to admit. If you are not into those type of emotional disturbances, I would advise you not to get this game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and felt as though I really accomplished something at its end. Of course I wasn't expecting much when I started to play this game, but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and was kind of glad to finish it, because now I can get on with the rest of my life (how depressing). :) WOW!."
3,I bought because I like the Final Fantasy Series,"The story is cheesy. The graphics are good. The music is depressing. When I started playing this game I was pumped. The beggining fmv got me going. Then I started playing... Will someone please get rid of that annoying music that you wont stop hearing! You'll get so frustrated when you have no clue on what to do. Random Battle after Random Battle,music after music, same gf after same gf, getting no where after nowhere. Gives you a headache. Do yourself a favor and get FFVII or FFIX"
3,Good but no comparison to 7.,"Out of all the Final Fantasys of this generation, I enjoyed this one the least. I had a feeling of blandness when I played it. The main character was very bland as well. Still, it was good enough to play through to the end, but that's about it."
2,Yuck,"Sure the graphics are great, but so what? The game is artificially lengthened by having ridiculously long repeating animations that you can't click out of. The plot is so slow, you'll fall asleep. The characters are annoying. The battle system is automatic and... boring. There is pretty much no reason at all why you need to play this game. If you want to play a good Jap. RPG, get an old copy of Final Fantasy VII or Wild Arms 2. Skip this one. The only thing in this game is Squaresoft and EA's over inflated egos."
3,Changes....but for the good?,"This game was somewhat of a disappointment. OK, yeah the graphics, play control, and GF's were cool, but where was the story. You never have an enemy you truely hate. In FF7 you hated Sephiroth, and for those who played the game you know why. The Junction system was also a huge pain. I'm a big fan of the FF series but this didn't live up to the normal standards"
3,Unnecessarily complicated.,"This game is awesome, great graphics, great characters... blah, blah, blah. I would gladly have sacrificed the graphics for a better hero (Squall is just an emotional wuss) a less convoluted plot, a better plot, or better secondary characters. Being able to name two characters just isn't enough. Either you've got established characters (i.e. Lunar... a great game) or you've got those with personalities that you get to form a bit, and name. (i.e. any other FF game) This game was good, and fun, but the GF system was mildly annoying, and the fact that offensive spells were worthless was pretty sad. Physical attacks were pretty worthless, too. Combat was basically a series of GF's, not my cup of tea. The game was good, but frankly I expected it to be great."
5,Thank you to the makers of FF series!,Good soundtrack! Nice battles! Awesome game over all! Glad I got to play it as a teen! Thank you Square Soft! Or Square Enix! Whatever it's called!
4,FAT ABBUTT sez...,"It was ok... I think FF7 is much better though. I think the magic system is just plain annoying, restocking spells or getting more in preparation to fight a boss is dull and hardly fulfilling. The materia system from FF7 was MUCH better, no need to worry about running out of spells. Of coarse you can always run out of ether, but ether is everywhere and much easier to find or buy than certain types of spells. And junctioning wasn't too great of a thing either. I'd much rather just have things be simple. You always are changing junctioning around and screwing around with that when you could be getting on with the game. So in conclusion, it's a good game, but definately not as great as you may think. I enjoyed it, but I expected so much better. If you haven't played FF7 yet, buy that instead. It's cheaper, and a better game. If you already have FF7, FF8 is still a good buy. And remember children, Fat Abbutt luvs you!"
5,Second best FF game made,"If you liked any of the previous FF games (especially VII), then you will love FF8. Though it's not quite as satisfying as VII, you will still find that any rating below five stars for this game is just plain wrong. The junction system may seem difficult at first(it was for me), but you'll eventually wonder how you ever got along without it. Each character is unique, and the GF's(Guardian Forces) are superb. In fact, this game is so good, that you will feel let down, and disappointed by the real world when you are done playing it. Just one word of advice: If you get this game during the school year, your grades will drop exponentially. Wait until summer."
3,enjoyable but annoying,"I definitely agree with the above statement that there are too many random battles. The other thing is that as your characters go up in level so do the monsters they fight...Not in the sense of different area different/stronger monsters...no no...same area same but stronger monsters. This might not be a problem except that in order to upgrade your weapons you have to steal certain items from monsters, but as the monsters go up in level the probability of them carrying certain items changes. So at a certain level it becomes very difficult a) to survive a fight with a formerly moderate strength monster and b) to get the items you need to morph your weapons so you stand a chance. This game was definitely a challenge. The plot was pretty decent. I have definitely liked other Final Fantasy games better though."
2,Hardcore FF fans must be disappointed by this one,"i had finished FF7 and thought that FF8 would be a great game. I had heard so much about how it would be very hard, have gret graphics, etc... So WHAT THE HELL happened to everything else? After dying about ten times my first time thru FF7 with a strategy guide's help, I thought this game would be near-impossible with my decision not to use a strategy guide. I only died twice in the WHOLE ENTIRE game! The characters were terrible, and after FF7's splendor, I thought that everything would be better. Buy this game, definitely. It's almost a masterpiece. But where did the brilliance of every other FF go? Square has got to learn that graphics are the last thing you worry about when trying to construct an awesome RPG."
2,Terrible,"If you are having trouble on trying to find some good RPG's, skip right past this one and go to something like Chrono Cross, Lengend of Dragoon, or Final Fantasy 7 (much much better than FF8). It maybe fun at first but it can get very annoying, don't waste your time or all your allowance on this game, go and get something else! FF7 and CC are exsamples of great games, FF8, PATHETIC!"
1,GOOD BUT BAD,"I never thought a game would be good and bad. The first 2 disks were amazing but then they got into the real plot of the game which sucked. They had a plot where they couldnt have an ending because nothing had happened. Squall is also [...], no joke."
1,It stinks,When I played this game there were no good graphics the game had NO STORYLINE AT ALL. The only good thing was the card game which you had a chance to win. The game sometimes froze on me. The people werent changling. THIS GAME COULD BE BETTER
1,Just sad............,This game is very bad. I really did not like this game if you want a good game get Final Fantasy 7!!!!!! That is a great great game I love that game so much!!!!
1,Incompetence,"This game is truly pathetic. One of the things I really enjoyed about FF7 and all the other fantasies was MP and matertia; now what do we have in this game? Easy to use and get summons that take MINUTES to perform. How are you supposed to get better-gain levels right? Well, in this game the creatures (which are really bland by the way) gain levels when you do. Unlike the editorial review tells you the characters are not worth caring about..they all are whiny and act like jerks (especially squall) This game is worth nothing and espicially when compared to squaresofts rejuvination of FF9. This game was a fluke in FF's history and will hopefully be the only one..."
1,Big Dissappointment,"This was the single most dissappointing FF game that I have Ever played. Unless you only buy video games for the graphics, don't waste your money. Every Final Fantasy game that I have ever played has kept me interested until the very end but this game sucked. I couldn't even play the game anymore after the third disc. Go spend your money on either FF7 or FF9."
1,Can you say SPECTACULAR?,"...because that's what Final Fantasy 8 isn't, spectactular. With its horrible gameplay and mediocre storyline it's very strange that Electronics Gaming Monthly gave it one of its most prestigious awards. The characters in this game are so boring, I know that all of you know a 'Squall' or 'Zell' or even 'Edea' in your life, and I pity you. Yawn. This Role Playing Game can look better when played on the new Playstation 2 where its graphics will become even more crisp and clear. Of course, the fact that you actually wasted money on a PS2 is another thing entirely. Also, graphics do not make a game, as demonstrated beautifully by FF9. In conclusion, buy this game if you are a masochistic Final Fantasy fan who thinks that just because it says Final Fantasy, it MUST be good."
2,Not one of Square's best,"Before the game came out I thought it didn't look very good, but I then I thought that it couldn't be that bad, this is Square were talking about! However I was greatly dissapointed. It has hardly any plot, too much love and half the game is ""find Rinoa!"" At first it was kinda fun, then I only played it for Triple Triad (the best part of the game) now I am only playing 'cause my sister told me the ending was good. I'm really stalling though. I hate how the enemies gain levels along with the strongest person in your group and unless you level up everyone else a whole lot, Squall is always about 30 levels higher than the rest of the characters. It makes things really tough to beat. I also didn't like the junctioning. If a character doesn't have HP junction then they don't have enough hit-points to fight anything so when you have to parties there is not always enough GF to go around. It also makes you way too dependent on them."
3,Beautiful graphics...but I hate the battle system...,"The graphics are beautiful (and there are plenty of hot guys :P), but I couldn't even bring myself to finish the first disc because of the battle system. It seems as if I need to use the summons in each battle and they take FOREVER! I found the graphics dazzling the first time, but by the 500th time, they began to get a little annoying..."
2,WORST FINAL FANTASY EVER!!!,"This is the worst Final Fantasy I have ever played, I have played all of the FF's starting with 1 but this is the worst to haave ever come out. If you are looking for a GOOD final fantasy try 7 or 10 if u can't get your hands on any of the older ones"
4,It's Final Fantasy.,"This game is a lot of fun. The story, graphics and sound are great (but this is to be expected from Final Fantasy). My only complaint about this game is the combat: Random encounters are very frequent, and they're on a turn-based engine. Square would do best by incorperating a variant of Final Fantasy XI's or Parasite Eve's combat system into their future RPG's."
5,Great story,"How often do you find a game in which they created a great story first and then the graphics?The story is vibrant and the characters are fun and unique. The person that created the storyline knows their literature and it shows. So when I recommend this game, it's not for the graphics (which are incredible), it's for the story. You would be hard pressed to find a better game than this."
4,"While a little quirky, it's still Final Fantasy...","Squaresoft went out and did it again. Building on the Final Fantasy 7 hype, they went out and bulit another machine in FF8. The incredible detail of this game really shines, from the graphics to the gameplay. This one is a must have, along with FF7 and GT2."
4,A great Game,"Final fantasy VII was a great game. It had cool graphics,great characters,and more. The GF system was a good replacement from the old summons. the only bad thing about the game is it is long but other wise a great game"
4,Huh...,"I had high expectations for this game. Graphics, story, general presentation -- it all falls short.The cinematics are excellent. The first one really got me pumped. I was convinced that I would be playing a game on-par with Final Fantasy 7. Shortly before Disc 1 ended, though, I was having trouble caring. Caring about the characters, caring about the story, caring if I finished the game.I'll attempt to play this game again sometime this year. Admittedly, I am more mature now than I was during my first attempt. Maybe the change in outlook will brighten my perception of this game."
5,the best,"A nice product. I recomend it because is useful for it purpose. Try it or buy it. Again, buy it."
3,"Fantastic, except for one thing.","Final Fantasy VIII was a beautiful game for the first Playstation. It has likeable characters and a good storyline, by video game standards. The thing is, the battle system is terrible. It's not fun to play (which is the whole point of video games), and the Guardian Forces (summoned monsters) scenes are cool the first few times, but take forever and can't be skipped.Is realistic to expect Square/Enix to remake the title with a different battle system? Something more akin to FF X?"
