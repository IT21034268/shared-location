2,Does it come Sugar Free.,"Man, my teeth are stinging form the sugar. Put me in some neon colored clothes and drop me right back in the 80's. This would have been great it's just 2o years late. Move on."
1,Ugh...,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
2,Arrived Broken,"Packing was not damaged but when my Granddaughter opened it on Christmas it was broken. Her father was able to glue it together but since outside of packing was not damaged at all, it had to have been packed for shipping already broken. She is using it but top drawers do not open at all. VERY disappointed with this for the money!!"
3,Nice but a bit small,"I should have measured my old armoire carefully prior to purchasing this. I had it all put together, and then realized that I wouldn't be able to accommodate everything that had been in the older piece of furniture."
3,It has scratches on my stone.,"I bought this stone and DMT extra coarse. The extra coarse's arrived with few chips on the edge. It looks like some one, who has used it before. For the DMT extra fine stone, it also has scratches like used item. I don't want to exchange them for another new ones, because it takes so much trouble. I'm starting to question the products from Amazon.Overall, both are still functional. They get my kitchen knives sharp. they're worth for your investment in long term if you are into sharpening. In addition, their rubber feet really work well."
5,Great sharpening plate,"These DMT continuous diamond sharpening plates are great. I bought the course, fine, and extra fine plates and have been very please with all three. They are faster cutting than their natural stone counterparts and much more convenient to use. I just spray a little window cleaner on them to float the shavings and it works great. I highly recommend this product."
4,Great effort by an incredible singer ...,"Have purchased the first 3 releases ... the first 2 at live shows ... make that incredible live shows! ... A must hear, a must see! (especially w/the Swingin Armadillo's)"
4,Good Book...Mostly,"Ok, I'm kinda a new Charmed fan, since I only became a real fan at the beginning of Season 3, but i've read transcripts and things so I know everything that happened in seasons 1&2. Anyway, I think that this is a pretty good book. I loved the plot, and the way they portray the characters is very real. I just have one problem- By the looks of things, it seems like (on the charmed timeline) that it's about the time of season 3, since Phoebe has her leviating power, and Piper & Leo are married. Now, here's the problem- THERE'S NO COLE!! I know that this is a different story, but you'd think that they could at least MENTION him. I guess you can tell I'm a very big Phoebe & Cole fan, huh? Well, other than the lack of Cole, it's a very good book. (and remember, Season 4 Premiere date is September 27!!)"
1,Better UNSUNG indeed! Beware!!!,"""a Native American Yoko Ono""...At least Yoko never pretended to be able to wrestle with a saxophone.If you found Yoko worthwhile, this work is for you! It may even raise the bar for truly mediocre expression as it simultaneously lowers the level of what some consider art.Seldom does one encounter such a cacophony of mediocrity masquerading as high art. A rating of one star is one star to high."
5,The Yellow Star: The Legend of King Christian X of Denmark,This is a beautifully written and illustrated book for younger students. The story focuses on positive lessons of the Holocaust by highlighting attributes such as loyalty and treating people fairly. The author's notes tell what is legend and what is factual about the story of King Christian X of Denmark and his wearing the yellow star.
5,"May not be true, but ...","There is no proof this story is true, but it has been passed down through the years as fact. It's a story about the kind of leader you always want to serve, who is thoughtful, intelligent, and loves his people. This is a great short story to use in the study of WWII and 6th grade history."
2,Behind the Bedroom Walls,"This book is a legend that was written by: Carmen Agra Deedy.This book is when the Nazis took over Denmark in 1940. The Danes tried to protect the Jews by hiding them. Their King loses control of Denmark. This book is related to Number the stars, because they were around the same time and they book is about raiding the Jews. They both take place in Denmark and envolve world war 2. They also envolve the star of David. In the Yellow Star that was a jewish symbol and the nazis used it to hurt the jews and take advantage of them."
1,History Grad. student,"Authors should be more responsible in writing historical fiction, by sticking to the truth and not by distorting history. They ought to write their chara. around the history, not the other way!"
2,Save your money,"This game is pretty lame. In easy mode you only have to shoot somewhere in the vicinity of the enemy and you will kill him but in normal mode it takes multiple hits to kill him. The enemy somehow is able to shoot through things and you can't. Movement is very restricted as you can only go on the designated path due to the invisible walls all over the place. If you can get it from the bargain bin and want something pretty easy and quick to play, this game may be acceptable but if you are used to COD quality, save your money."
1,Expensive paperweight,"Downloaded the firmware from the PC, but just does not want to turn ON even though the battery is fully charged.For now, it's just an expensive paperweight"
1,Very disappointing,"I expected more from a Mike Caro DVD. Any of the poker books out there will give you better information. Considering it is only 40 some minutes - and no one can distill what's there in a good book to a 40 minute DVD. This is a very basic beginner type DVD and even still there is nothing you can learn or apply from watching it. I'd go by one of the books that has been reviewed 4-5 stars here on amazon, rather than get this DVD."
1,5 Minutes worth viewing,"Save your $18 and don't add this one to your cart. There is very little substance in this video. Caro provides 10 interesting ""poker tells"" that are worth viewing but you stop at your local bookstore and spend 5 minutes reading his book on poker tells and get the same info.The rest of the DVD is very, very basic hold-em strategy that even a novice should know.Mike may be a genius but he isn't sharing much of his grey matter in this DVD."
1,Not very good,"Okay the Mad Genius has my utmost respect his pro poker tells video is awesome, but this was designed at teaching ppl to win and just doesnt do it. It does tell u about starting hands and thats it nothing on how to play after the flop. Most ppl think after the flop u either have the best flop and bet or you fold. This is incorrect and this dvd mentions nothing about flopping mid pair draws etc. It has absolutey nothing on post flop and gets a 1-5 fom me"
1,Pathetic.,"This DVD is a joke. Extremely basic beginner type material and presented in a way that is of absolutely no use to anyone. Caro gives a quick run down on which starting hands are considered playable but gives no indication on how to actually play them ie: which positions they are playable, whether you should raise or call and what to do with them following a raise etc. There is literally zero advice on playing after the flop or on fundamentals like pot odds/ counting outs etc and his garbage on tells is getting really old. This is one of the worst instructional DVD's on the market. Spend your money on any of the ""Expert hold 'em"" series by Fromm, Miller, Jacobs, Stoxtrader etc if you are serious about improving your poker game through DVD instruction. Why does this guy enjoy the status he does in the poker/ gambling world? He's not David Sklansky for crying out loud!"
3,Not bad for price,"For the price this kitchen set is good looking and seems sturdy enough. There were a few dents, nicks, and scratches mostly on the chairs which were shipped assembled and in two's. There was definitely not enough padding between the chairs when they were boxed."
3,Is okay,"Table is okay but, chairs are very cheep. Two chairs broke withen a week. Buy only if u need table just for show and not to use.."
5,"TO ME, THE BEST JBS ALBUM","a classic from that golden age. mr. matthew does not understand that back then, simplicity mixed with that raw vibe and unique production was the key. BECAUSE I GOT IT LIKE THAT, the title cut, BEHIND THE BUSH, ON THE RUN (lovely use of the jimmy castor bunch), BRAGGIN AND BOASTIN, BLACK IS BLACK, WHAT'S GOIN' ON (nice use of prince at the end there), and I'M GONNA DO YA.................how can one deny the head noddin' addictiveness of these songs? ESSENTIAL!!!!"
3,Just not my kind of music,"I respect the Jungle Brothers for being pioneers of house/hip hop, however its just not really my style. Back in the day this album may have been something else, but compared to other albums the beats are very simple and none of the rappers in the group are incredibly gifted. The 3 stars are out of respect for the Jungle Brothers for doing there thing. You might enjoy this album, it's just not really the kind of music I like."
2,Talk about B-O-R-I-N-G!,"I'm a big fan of noir films, but I have to say these are the most boring things I have seen in quite a while."
5,This album rocks,Downtown baghdad bluse is a song that says the wars is screwed up but they are behind the troops. This band takes time to get used to. They are so awesome live if you get the chance to see them. The band is a lot like guiness you either like them or don't. So if you want to try something new give them a shot. I am looking forward to seeing them again.
4,Great album,"Truly a great album, but the recording of the songs are por in some sections of the album. i.e. in Life Like That, Isn't It, the back-up vocals completely drown out the leads. In several other songs, the leads are drowned out by bass instruments. Other than that, the music is very good. I'm looking forward to up-coming music from Black 47"
2,musically sound....vocally?,Ok I'm not real sure what I expected when I ordered this CD but what I got was something that I had a hard time listening to. The band muscially has wonderful arrangements. Good use of Sax and horns and strong guitars. out of all the songs on the CD the only one I could get through and say was ok was Uncle Jim. Sort of a reel feel to it. Downtown Baghdad Blues has good lyrics. My problem with the entire CD is the lead singer. I Personally think he tries to over sing the songs. Sounds to me like he is in pain. This is just my personal opinion. Others really enjoy this Cd. I didn't.
3,"Not as original as RE1, not as innovative as RE2","I read somewhere that RE3 seems like a bonus disk for RE2. I agree. Nothing's really new. RE1 introduced us to the series. It was original and scary. RE2 offered improved graphics and, in my opininon, a more complex Resident Evil experience. RE3 in my mind is RE2 with different maps and enemies. Not a total waste of time, but I'd encourage you to try RE4 if you haven't already."
3,Resident evil 3,"After much thinking about buying this game, I did and I regret it, the game is in excellent condition I am very happy with the purchase I will continue recommending amazon.com purchases"
3,Good Game,"This game will be good but could have been better with additional scenes, rooms, weapons and more. All of the RE games are worth playing but for a game with just updated graphics [this price] is...unrealistic and greedy."
3,Good but not great.,"This game is alright. At this point only hardcore RE fans should be buying stuff like this, or fans who have missed out on earlier chapters. If you've never played RE4 then it's a lot more fun... but after Resident Evil 4 all other RE games sort of look bad, play poorly, and aren't much fun."
2,Barely enjoyable.,Graphics 6/10Playability 7/10Fun 6/10 (Too mutch running around i kept getting lost!)Difficulty 9/10 (The Nemisis apears out of nowear and trys to kill u & u cant run!)Nowere near as good as the oringinal.Overall 2/5
4,"gOOD GAME, BUT NEVER EALLY LIKED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE","This game is classic RE. Same controls as always and slightly better graphics. I dont think there is anything new. I love RE, but the only thing i dont like about this game is that you have that stupid nemesis guy chasoin you around all the time. its annoying"
1,"Boring game, no action whatsoever.","The game is very boring and a waste of money. I bought it for my grandchildren, and they do not like it at all."
2,not my type of game,ive played this game for like a few hours and i thought i was stupid and scary i gave it two cause its lotrs of fun shooting zombies but the thing really bothering me is the main enemy of the game NEMESIS. He follows you nonstop and i hate games when they follow you the entire game cause its annoying and theres no new creatures and theres not even new graphics. you can play this game if you like....but i warned you.
5,Resident Evil Nemesis,"Thank you this game is really cool with adventure, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves Resident Evil or just about any game. It's really exciting owning this game and I can't stop playing, thank you."
5,Best of the Resident Evils,"I loved this game for PS1, but when my disc scratched and my PS1 went down, I decided to get Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube since I don't really use that console often (except for Resident Evil 4). This is hands down the best in the Resident Evil series, although 4 was very good, 3 just had the whole storyline, items, and that Nemesis chasing you through the entire game, that's just genius. I like playing on ""easy mode"" for the amount of ammo they give you."
5,what coaching books should be,"This book really is what books on coaching should be. Solid, theoretically-based and applicable. Beats most of the other executive coaching books hands down. One of the best books on coaching around."
5,"The real deal: no fluff, no hype","As an independent career coach, I find most of the so-called ""coach training"" to be ideological and idiosyncratic. In contrast, this book utilizes research and offers some genuine intellectual content. The first part of the book was especially helpful to me and I particularly appreciated the chapter on midlife career changers.My only quibble is the reference to Jung and the Myers-Briggs tests. I find labels and tests unscientific at best and even potentially harmful when dealing with adults. Considerable research shows that people tend any so-called ""description of yourself"" as accurate."
4,The Greek Tycoon' s love~child(the Greek tycoon),Very good book and I love the way the main man finally showed his weakness. I will be reading more books by this author
2,Definitely Not Worth Buying or Reading!,"I gave this one more than a 1 star because I've at least finished reading it, but I never intend to again & would never recommend it to anyone who's never read it before!The story was just so very flat & boring that I now can't even remember what the story was about at all, & this is an extremely unusual occurance for me! There was simply absolutely nothing that was emotionally-gripping in this book! I think this is definitely 1 of the worst books written by JB!"
2,Parrot cage...too small for blue fronted amazon,"We bought this and put it together. It is SO low to the ground. Our parrot has had the bottom of his cage at least 3 feet off the floor for 30 years. Also the demensions stated were not for the actual cage, so it was really not tall enough. the measurements were for the total height. We tried to exchange, but were told you cannot exchange with a bank card? So now other things have come up and our bird is still in his old cage."
5,Music To Open Your Mind,"The Ozric's are at again with their newest release entitled ""Waterfall Cities"". For those of you who are not yet familiar with Ozric Tentacles search no further for the best ""space-jam"" instrumental band today. Get ready to be taken on an aural journey into the universal mindscape with each unique track. As usual they touch on many different sounds and styles, common-place for this diverse band. For those listeners who are familiar with the Ozric way of life, you will not be disappointed in the least with ""Waterfall Cities"". Just when you thought Ozric has taken you as far as you can go, they take you even further. I highly recommend this and all other Ozric Tentacles cd's."
5,Another wonderul atmospheric space-jam by the Ozric's.,"I have now had the new cd Waterfall Cities for a few days and can say it is pure beauty outside of a few elements in just a couple of songs that I still need to get used to. Anyway I can't say enough about these guys and I will thoroughly enjoy the show 7/21/99 in MPLS! This new CD is a bit more laid back than Curious Corn, but yet it jams quite hard in some areas too. Nice sounding tunes, all of them! The production is pretty good, but I have heard better produced cd's. This is hardly a problem though I just tend to notice there are some parts of the cd where the drums seem a bit ""paper"" sounding, but in general the production is rich. Good going Ozric's and keep 'em coming."
5,Spiral Mind & Coily- Oz T Best ever!,"Next to Erpland, (FOR ME) this is the best overall CD from Ozric Tentacles! This is the second line up of the current band and it all comes together here. This ensemble works very, VERY well together. Ed has his usual mastery of the cosmic music waves. The band CLEARLY draws much influence from the Gong Record You, but they play it better and with more of a percussive punctuation than even Gong did! The new line-up from 1997 pulls together here and has not come close to matching this achievement. I am sorry if your a fan and disagree with my thinking here. Buy Pongmaster's Ball then (it is aweful- the good members left the band for that). Waterfall Cities IS an EXCELLENT spin!"
4,This book had a few ideas and some good scenarios about what to look for -,"Anyone who goes to events and must ""mix"" will find this helpful, as well as for those who must facilitate meetings."
2,So-so,"While there were some helpful and interesting techniques sprinkled throughout the book, a lotof the so-called non-confrontational ploys sounded like empty appeasements to folks who wouldn'tbe interested or willing to hear another side.I think Gabor got a little side-tracked and his ""assertive"" techniques lacked some aggressive boundary settingprinciples. A lot of his assertive techniques amounted to little more than insincere and disingenuousflattery to try and soften up the difficult person. And a real tough customer will see right throughthat garbage immediately and chew you up before you get started.Much better to stress stating personal opinions and boundaries rather than tossing up fluffy, phonycompliments that you both know you even remotely mean in the futile hope the other guy will somehow all of a sudden decide to be someone he's not and consider your feelings or ideas. Pretty naive.Not bad but not exceptional."
1,Edelbrock 4245 Valve Covers,A nice looking valve cover on the out side but if you look on the bottom where the valve cover seats on the head it in most cases has grind marks on the mold casting and where the bolt holes along with some pitting in the casting. A very poor clean up not done properly buy Edelbrock.
5,Woof!,"Wow, just installed my new sound system including this Polk PSW125. First thing, I put on a variety of action movies with deep sound. Felt like the room shook. Caught some deep notes with music. No issues, beautiful cherry finish. A little bigger than I thought it was going to be so check the physical dimensions."
3,Finish,I got this to add base to my pair of Polk RTi A7's. The A7's have a beautiful cherry finish while this has a pretty cheap look to it. Does not match the speakers at all. Sound is fine but finish is dissapointing.
5,ample sub,"Having owned speakers with 15"" woofers for many decades I never could justify adding a subwoofer. However, my new receiver doesn't provide the low notes to the front main speakers as previously owned receivers. I could tell the bass was insufficient so I purchased this 12"" Polk Audio sub with beautiful cherry veneer. The difference has shown a new dimension to music and movies that has been missing. This sub is easy to hook up and has serious thump. While I could shake the house before now the house absolutely throbs. Controls on the back can contour the sound to keep it from being overpowering. I'm now considering replacing my front main and center speakers with Polk."
3,Book of Tastings,"I thought this was going to be more of a guide as to what belgian beers should be like, common traits and whatnot. In reality it was a taste rating of tons of different belgian beers. Not exactly what I was looking for, and I lost some credit when it gave stella artois such a good rating..."
2,Poorly Executed Mishmash,"This sounds like Lux Interior and Lou Barlow hooked up with the idea of ripping off Nick Cave, but found themselves writing lyrics that were really crappy hacks of his ideas. Not to belabor the point - where Barlow's low-fi production often sounds ingenious and Cave's lyrics are brilliant examples of Deep South and Appalachian gothic mythology, this sounds hackneyed and contrived on both counts. For my money, if you want something like this, anything by 16 Horsepower or Woven Hand (even with the bible beating message) will do you much better."
4,the fun began after it was on,"She didn't like this costume going on or coming off, but then again she doesn't like any clothes going on or off. In between those two times she was happy and we loved the costume. She's 9 months and it fit well. Not the most spectacular outfit at the party, but darn cute and funny."
3,"Not what I expected, but cute.","This costume is made of felt so everything sticks to it and it has lots of static. I had to take the decorative stitching out of the head part as I couldn't get it over my 3 month old's head as it was. Still cute and definitely long enough. You can still use the car seat if you pull up the bottom of the bunting. I wish there was a zipper or snaps on the back for easier dressing. Instead it's like putting a super skinny pillow case on a porking baby. But once it's on, it's cute."
1,Infant Tootsie Roll Costume,Well it looked cuter online than it actually was. It was a one piece costume which is difficult to put on an infant AND the hood part of it was very tight. Most infants have chubby cheeks so they need a little space. In order to get him in the costume; I had to have someone hold him and then force my hands through the hood to try and push his face through. The poor kid was miserable when I put it on him. He looked cute once I got it on him but it really wasn't worth all the aggravation and money. It was made out of felt or something. Very disappointed in the costume over all.
1,Tootsie Roll Infant Costume,"While this is a cute outfit, it is cheaply made and could not possibly fit a baby who weighs more than 10 pounds, regardless of what the packaging says."
1,Did not fit!,"This is a very cute costume, but the head portion DID NOT FIT over my baby's head. He was about 4 months old and his head wouldn't fit through the extremely tiny hole for the hood portion of the costume. I ended up ripping the head off and having him wear it like that."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"PROS: This costume is cute. My baby was able to wear it.CONS: The red in the costume bled onto the white in the costume while folded in the package. The neck hole was so small, the stitching started breaking when I tried to put my 3 month old in it. I had to basically cut the back of the entire costume to put my baby into it."
3,Looks cute but the sizing runs big for a newborn!,"The product is felt-like and looks just like it does in the photo. I haven't put it on our baby yet, but it looks like it will be too big to actually look like the baby in the photo - our baby will be about 6 weeks by Halloween and he isn't super chubby so it looks like the costume is going to run too big. The good thing is the bottom is like a drawstring so if it was too small I could let his legs dangle out. I would have liked to know the dimensions from the neck to the bottom and the width/diameter of the costume so I could have had a better idea of the sizing before we purchased!Unfortunately it looks like it will be too long for him, but we will see. That is just a sizing thing - not necessarily a jab on the costume itself. For the price and the speedy shipping, it's a very cute costume idea!"
4,My son looks adorable in his tootsie roll costume!,I am so glad I ordered this for my son's first Halloween. He looks just precious as a tootsie roll and the costume fits well. He is 3 months old and about 13 lbs. No probs with the head as I'd read in other reviews. This outfit prob wouldnt be good for much bigger children so that it is marketed up 'til 9 months is misleading.
3,Good but not great,"I needed this for a project and thought it looked perfect. I got it in a timely manner and the cover was great. Really pretty and just as cool as the picture looked. I liked the smell and texture of the pages. The only thing for me was that the texture makes it very hard to write on the pages and anything but a ballpoint pen bleeds badly. If you want it to mostly paste things into then definitely get it, but not the best for a diary."
5,I love worship music!,Love this CD. Glad I found it on Amazon.com good music well worth purchase price! Songs For CommunionHillsong best music on market!
3,"Worth it for ""Eagle's Wing"" alone","The two movies on this dvd differ considerably on all levels. I have not been able to bear watching ""A Town Called Hell"" all the way through, only managing brief snippets; simply put, it's a bad movie. Not only that, the image quality is horrible, and the audio has a muffled squeaking sound that persists in all parts of the movie that I've watched.With ""Eagle's Wing"" things improve considerably. It's an interesting story about an inexperienced trapper/ex-soldier played by Martin Sheen who finds himself drawn into a cat-and-mouse game with a Comanche Indian because of a horse. I found it quite entertaining and gripping, and was impressed by the cinematography despite the movie's less-than-ideal image quality (somewhat better than that of ""A Town Called Hell,"" though). unfortunately, it looks as though this is the only option if one wants a dvd of this movie."
5,"Fabulous, fun, and very Froggy!","He's back! A really fun and exciting book for soccer fans...Froggy and his gang of friends are good sports, and have a lot of fun while becoming champions of good attitude, and their league. A great book for parents too, it highlights the fun that should be team competition...and, of course, it's very funny..."
1,Book falls apart,"This is my grandson's favorite Froggy story. However, the quality of the paper back book is abysmal. Both copies fell apart within 24 hours, with the middle pages detaching almost at once. Children's books must be durable and these are not. Don't waste your money."
2,Just mailing it in at this point,"The original ""Froggy Gets Dressed"" book was extremely clever. But this book is the weakest brand extension since Lego clothing. It includes the basic Froggy elements (sound effects starting with z, authority figures yelling ""FRROOGGYY"", and our noble protagonist turning more red than green) but you have to wonder when the most original part of the story is Froggy picking his nose. Of course, if your child likes Froggy and likes soccer they will love the book, but I wish the authors had put a bit more effort into it."
1,In flight confusion,"This is by far the worst language-related product I have ever purchased. This CD assumes that you can learn a language by memorizing long, complicated phrases by rote with no foundation whatsoever in vocabulary or grammar. It is just not possible to remember long setences relating to travel without first learning anything about the basic grammar of a language. The phrases aren't even repeated or broken down. This CD might be useful if you have already taken some modern Greek and want to brush up on travel phrases. Otherwise save your money -- most Greeks who work in airports and hotels speak English and this CD won't help you have much of a conversation with anyone who doesn't."
4,In-Flight Greek,"Face it, airport delays notwithstanding, you won't become fluent in a foreign language on the way to your destination! However, I found this series (I also bought ""In-Flight Italian"") to be very useful for brushing up my language skills. I think the program is well-organized and covers just about every topic a vacationing traveler could want. Yes, they occasionally throw a very long sentence at you that you couldn't possibly hope to repeat, but they do supply you with a companion booklet with which you can read along."
3,Disappointing..,"I expected a Bollywood quality movie but instead received a poorly edited (LOTS of jump cuts) overly melodramatic, at times poorly acted, student experiment. I'm glad to see an attempt at addressing the reality of homosexual relationships but this one didn't make the cut. I gave it three stars ONLY for the South Asian Male eyecandy that made it all tolerable."
1,If Only I Could Rate Only a Single Star!--Horrendously Dreadful . . . Stay Away,"I love Bollywood and overall India's movies including some Tamil/Telugu films.When I heard about Bollywood's bold take on the gay genre, I was hopeful. When I saw ""Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyun,"" I was sourly disappointed. Think about the boy who cried wolf or that you're caught up-lying and exaggerating about something. You got caught and how embarrassing! This BW film is like that. The acting is DREADFUL!!! I am not kidding. The veteran actors, e.g. Helen's lines were delivered like no impact and just plain dull.I would avoid this poor excuse for a Bollywood film.I will give 1-star for effort and right intentions with the movie, but poorly and sloppy execution. Plot, dialogue, and character development were non-existence."
1,Item pictured and described is not what is sent,Item that is pictured is not what is sent. Very disappointed that this has not been corrected yet. The item pictured and described is the 3 in 1 sunshade offering full coverage. What is sent is the Compact Shade Attachment which only offers canopy coverage.
4,This book is really dirty!!!,I read this book and thought that it was one of pike's best books but the one thing I hated was there was too much sex involved. The review written by one of the readers reviewed the wrong book. the review should go to master of murder!!
5,Die Softly,"I really liked, how the person I didn't suspect, was the murderer, and it's weird how that is, but I don't want to give it away.I also like how Herb, the main character, wasn't perfect and popular like most of Christopher Pike's characters are. I also liked how Herb would do things for Alex, just because he was in love with her. He was really whipped by her!"
4,awesome book,"awsome book, second best i ever read next to the tachyon web. Christopher Pike is this best author to ever live. this book was awesome,althought the ending was a little dissapointing which is why i took off 1 star."
4,Heavy topic's,"I remember this book from when I was young. Then end was writen in such a silly way added to how creept out I was. Not only was it very guesome but it played on a theme that is very adult in nature. This is why I recall this Christopher Pike novel in particular. The characters are so young and innocent and played this way in the book as they are, its only too easy for children to be shocked by the scope of the ending. Like a child watching Kids or Train spotting to view the realities of life, it was after a lot of reflection that this book made me think even harder about teenage decisions and their after affects. The main character is strong and becomes heroic in nature. Not only is this book entertaining, a great read, but also thought provoking. Four Stars."
2,Not a good way to get started,"Colloquial Croatian expects far too much of a beginning learner of a foreign language, and the information it does provide is often confusingly explained and organized. When a new grammatical point is introduced, minimal exercises are provided which allow you to practice it, and most of those do not have an answer key. Tables of declensions and conjugations are provided in the back, but in the main text they are replaced instead by verbal explanations which often left me flipping through the pages trying to find the appropriate form. The dialogs and text selections are too numerous and complicated to absorb effectively. Intermediate-level students will find it a useful tool for review and additional learning, while casual learners will find it a place in the recycling."
1,Badly organized,"This book lacks a thorough description of grammar, choosing to selectively omit concepts when the author fiunds it too difficult to tackle. The reader is them left to figure out those concepts by himself because they were too hard to explain -- go figure! The book is also using words not explained in the glossary, and the exercises need words that have not been introduced. The CD does not cover all dialogues."
1,BUY THE HARD COPY,"This edition does not properly display diacritics on some of the letters (specifically all derivations of c). This is a function of the text encoding on Kindles that means that they can only display western languages. In Croatian, this means that several letters are all being written as one, as if an English reading textbook were printing j, f, and d all as f and you were supposed to learn how to read from that. Buy the hard copy."
4,Good buy,This was shipped on time and is great quality for such a low price. This was definitely a positive buying experience.
4,Garbage man's friend,"My husband is a garbage man and uses this support in his work every day. He finds the most helpful things about it is a reminder to ""tuck"" your stomach and use your legs not your back. It's very adjustable and fits my 240lb 6'4"" husband just fine."
2,Whey't a minute!!!!,"First of all, let me say that I have been using whey low exclusively in my iced tea, and have totally replaced sugar in my kitchen with this product for several years. I thought is was great, and I can say that of it tastes indistiguishable from sugar. However, a few weeks ago my 12 year old son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal. When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately. We have tried it several times with the same result. I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product. I won't be buying anymore. Sorry it took me so long to find out. It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time."
4,"Solid Album, Definitely Worth Your Money","I wouldn't qualify that record with the 'classic' label but it is undeniably a very hot and inspired piece of work. Buddha Monk isn't exactly the best lyricist out there but he's got a very tight flow and does his music with his heart and guts. For me, Buddha Monk got a very rare thing that Guru once called 'the voice'. Like KRS-1 or Chuck D, he's got a deep and powerful voice that makes him unique in the rap game. It's a shame that the Buddha Monk doesn't get more attention and media coverage because he really deserves props and shows in this album an important potential yet to come. On the production side, quality control is, with a few exceptions, maintained, and you get a dark and paranoid vibe punctuated with heavy beats.If you love good hardcore Hip Hop made by people who got love for the game and true skills, do yourself a treat and pick this up."
2,Lisle 38850 pulley puller,"This puller was only used on a GM power steering pump pulley. The part of the puller called the ""body"" fit the pulley groove so loosely that as the tool was tightened it began to pull at an angle, not parallel to the pump shaft. This nearly ripped the lip off the pulley groove before the pulley came off. If I need to do this again I will look for a puller made specifically for a GM pulley, not one advertised to fit ""most GM, Ford and Chrysler vehicles."" I would not recommend buying the tool for use on GM pulleys."
2,US game could not be played in Austria,"Game was sent promptly and in a very good condition, but it couldn't be played in european GameCube"
1,Just Plain Lazy,"What is the point. Capcom goes to all the trouble of giving the original Resident Evil a face life and then they just decide to get lazy and port the game to GCN?What is the logic of paying $40- $50 on a game that has no new improvements,no added storyline or features of any kind, a graphics that are archaic by today's standards? You can probably find it on Ebay for $5 - $10 for PS1.Total Rip off."
1,What the heck!?55 bucks!?!?!??,"Ridiculous...you can buy a Playstation for 15 bucks, and a RE2 game for only 7 or 8 bucks at any store. This is a pathetic attempt to capitalize off of idiots. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!You can buy it for N64 for a very cheap price as well, and the graphics are the same. As far as I know they didn't really change anything about this game. I just cannot believe they are chargine so much money for this, RE3, and code veronica-X, unbelievable. This is a great game, if you buy it for PS1/PS2, or N64. I would rather play it on PS1 anyway, it has a more classic, old school feel to it. Anyway, if you are dumb enough to actually dish out 55-200 bucks for this game, be aware you are ripping yourself off."
2,Resident Evil 2 for Game Cube is a huge let down,"The title pretty much says it, but basically after playing RE1, which I had never played before GC, I was instantly hooked on the game and naturally wanted to check out the others in the series. Unfortunately, in part 2 nothing was done to remake the game, the game looks like an old super nintendo game, the graffics are weak and very 2-D. The sound is not much better, and after playing an extremely challenging RE1 which took a good 2 months to beat, I was sadly able to beat RE2 in 1 week. And this is significant as I am NOT a gamer, so if I can beat it in one week, a true gamer probably would beats this thing in 8 hours. Here are my ratings by category: Graffix 2/5, Sound 3/5, Game Controls 4/5, Over-all 2/5. Don't waste your money on this, if you really love the RE series, rent this one."
1,This blows,"There was like a million resident evil games and which more are coming out. What's the concept. Go around kill zombies, Takes forever, and don't be goin over your friends house to watch him play this because you'll fall asleep after your tenth heart attack after drinking soda. We were at my friends birthday party and all he did was sit there and play this until we flipped out on him and begged him to do something more social."
4,Good Game,RE2 is a good game although outdated. I beat the game through twice using Leon and it was an enjoyable expirence but compared to RE4 his game is pretty bad. But if you ignore that then it's a great game. If you are a fan of the series or just looking for a fun game I recommend that you pick up RE2
4,The Terror Continues??,"Well Capcom has done it again! they have re-released another of the great resident evil series, but is it really worth the money that you paid? Unfortunately, i am starting to question that. i love resident evil, between all the systems that i have, i have every game. i love em, but i must say that i am rather dissappointed with the newest release of RE2. If you have played Zero and RE1 for gamecube, and are expecting those graphics in RE2, then save your money cause they are just not there. Its unfortunate too because those other games kicked some serious zombie A**! but i must say that the arranged game is quite a fun addtion to the game, although it is on the copy of the dreamcast version. if you want to keep your collection or resident evil games going and you have 45 bucks (or so) to spend then pick this game up, but if you budget is tight and you have this game for other systems, then wait and play what you have."
3,RE2 Outdated?,"well what can i say except that i am quite disappointed with the newest enstalment of RE2. Dont get me wrong, i love resident evil, but after seeing the work that was done with zero and with RE1, i have to admit that seeing RE2 as i would if i was playing my dreamcast is quite a let down. if you love resident evil you should own this game because well, its a great game, but if you are tight on money and have it already for another system, then go ahead and wait because you'll basically be buying the same game."
4,graphics???,the previous 2 games for GC where very good in every aspect. but i just bought resident evil 2 for GC and it's almost like they didn't even try...the graphics were [not good] it's still fun but the graphics are very disapointing
5,Awesome,"Just started playing and so far so good. It's a great game, I highly recommend this to all RE fans who haven't tried this one yet."
3,Good but one thing is missing,i have RE2 for psx and it [has] great 2 people mini games fun gameplay awesome story. the thing is it is a port not a remake so your gettin nothin new. graphics are psx nothin takin advantage of GC. So if i did not have it for psx i would get it if it was cheaper like a 20 because it a port from an old last generation game.
4,Rip-off!,"If you read any reviews about how this is a remake or how amazing the graphics are, those people are talking about the first RE, not RE 2. The first RE for GameCube is almost completely redone. RE 2 is nothing but a port, and a rip-off. I'm not kidding; in 1997, RE 2 on PSone sold for $50. In 2000, the Dreamcast version was $20. And now, in 2003, RE 2 for GameCube is $40. This game has no new extras. In fact, it's actually missing old extras. Now, if you want to check this game out, just rent it."
3,Not the best RE2 version...,"This is not the best RE2 version as I was expecting it to be.It's an exact port of the inferior PSX dual shock version. Theonly thing changed is the title screen voice, it now sounds like the voice from the RE0 title screen. For some reason the ex-files that linked the whole series together on the N64 version are now missing. I was really turned down by this RE port because It could of been better. After playing the GC port I still think the N64 version is the best but if you have neverplayed RE2 than I recomend you rent this one."
4,great game,"i first started playing resident evil games with the remake for the gamecube. it was amazing. the next RE game i played was RE2 for the gamecube. i new it wasnt a remake so i wasnt expecting too much. but it surprised me. this is a great game. the graphics are old, but when you are playing, you will barely notice. the onlytime you might is when somithing happens close to the camera, like if you shoot at it or glass breaks. oh, and you will notice the zombies arent as scary too. but when you get past the graphics, this game is almost as good as the first one for the gamecube. the game will still make you jump at times too. this just goes to show you that you don't need great graphics to make a great game."
4,Good Game,"This is an awesome game and I am a die-hard resident evil fan. I have beaten every game in the series and I own and saw the movie.I have every game for every system ever made so I think I know what I'm talking about. So this game is cool but kinda has the same graphics as Dreamcast. Nothing is really new like the Resident Evil 1 but if you are a die-hard fan like me then you better buy it. Oh yeah and the only reason the game got four stars is because of the graphics. If u are new to the series and have psone get the original resident evil if you can find it, it is awesome."
3,Slightly better-than-standard chick lit,"Bartlett keeps the readers reading with plenty of plot twists and mystery, but the Springsteen plot feels a bit forced at times and readers may occasionally hear the nagging question at the back of their head, ""why am I reading this?"" Overall an entertaining book, but nothing more than that."
5,Fairy Tale Meets Biography,"This is a fun and quick read. It's a bit of a fairy tale, with a princess and all the accessories. But,it has the sense of a biography (not the dry boring kind). We get to know Princess Izzy and all that makes her who she is.Can't wait until the author's next book."
2,"Great conductor, underwhelming soloists.",Very pleasant and vigorous conducting; the soloists range from pretty good to awful. Try Gardiner or King.
5,A Real Piece Of Work,Tom is one of the best singer/songwriters out there - bar none. Hearing is believing. This is a great CD by an accomplished artist.
5,AMAZING!!!,"If you LOVE dark chocolate and espresso....you WILL LOVE this chocolate bar!!! Besides, you can feel great about eating it...10% goes to a GREAT cause!!! =D"
3,It's an okay read,"This is a very lightweight read regarding the process of production. It's more of a personal journal, blog-style account than anything substantial a reader can learn from. However, it does have merit in that respect. So, if you're a newbie and want to get your feet wet, this may be a book you'd like to read to get yourself into those baby steps.It's a bit refreshing to read a guy's perspective when it's not full of posturing and bravado. The author has a more self-nurturing tone and approaches the work with humility, which again isn't bad for a newbie.The bottom line is: don't expect anything that is going to turn you into a video producer overnight. Admittedly, it's a hard profession, technical, requiring time, money and connections, and is very competitive. This is not a strong technical manual.I have a BA in Film/Video and make educational videos/multimedia for a living, so my perspective is a bit skewed."
4,Great info if you're looking to do your own semi-pro web videos.,"This book helped me to understand better how to stage interviews and setup lighting for different types of videos. It's great for the web, or any other mini-documentary or minor film. The outline of what types of cameras, lighting, settings, and extras needed to make it work are just what I was looking for, and his tips got me thinking on ways to make my filming look its best. I would highly recommend if you're a new, or are fairly new at filming."
1,The worst software ever user,I bought this thinking it will help me do taxes for Multiple states. I have to shell out [money] for the second state and even after that my software is showing only one state. I have spent half a day asking for help. The help person is asking me to do the download again by paying [more money]and has no idea about the 800 number from where you have to buy the code to enable another disk.I could have done the taxes manually much sooner.
2,"A Waste of Paper, Postage, and a CD","I love Turbo Tax. I use it every year. I get a certain perversive pleasure from doing my taxes.It is not extremely clear here.. but all this item does is let you load ONE state's tax forms on to your computer. You can just as easily--- no wait... MUCH more easily--- just download the program for the same (or a lower, if you look around) price and without the postage or the wait. I have to file in more than one state, so I took a chance on this product letting you utilize forms from multiple states, as its title and description seem to imply. But I was wrong.ADDENDUM: Fortunately, Amazon.com has clarified this situation with the ""Notes"" above....."
3,Beware - It's not Multi-State but Choose Your State,"I have used various state tax programs over the years and this one works best for users of TurboTax Federal. However, for those of us having to file multiple state returns, you only get access to ONE state with this program. Thus the TurboTax Multi-State is misleading as I found out last year when I bought the program and ended up having to buy two more to do my taxes! I agree with other users, there aren't many real ""help features"" with this program and if you have a simple Federal return, your state probably has an online source that would serve you well. With more complicated returns, it is a decent program. If anyone else out there has the same complaint as me, let the company know! I think additional state return access should be free or at a much reduced price since it isn't costing the company any more to let you have access to various states."
3,Mass taxes,"I've used this program for the past two (2) years and have found it to be a great help in figuring out my taxes...I still had to do the math on paper to break down the information as the program doesn't do this for you. I think it works well as a COMPANION to state tax forms and as a filing system (once you get the info inputed correctly, you can file electronically or print out a clean copy of your tax form). As a stand alone state tax preparing program, I don't trust it."
3,Support is woefully inadequate,"I made a mistake by inputting my federal withholding amount intomy state withholding amount. I was able to work around and get the program to apparently ""correct"" my state withholding amount. However, when trying to e-file, the program insists there is an error in the federal program, because I overrode the incorrect state withholding amount.Now the program will not let me e-file either of my returns and I'm left to mail in paper copies. There is no way I've found to reach a human being to correct the situation; if there is a way to correct it. Evidently if you pay for your returns, in order to get draft printouts, you cannot correct your W-2 input data."
3,You Can Not Electroncially File More Than One State Return,If you think you can file more than one state return electronically think again. Intuit only allows one federal and one state return per social security number. Any extra returns must be MAILED in.
1,Very Bizarre,"the music on this CD is very disappointing. Very strange music, not the music I was expecting. It's a big disappointment, and I gave the CD away to a garage sale."
2,A poor choice,"I purchased this book for my daughter (eight at the time) sight unseen. We were both disappointed.The science seems not that good, the experiments not well explained, the book poorly laid out and neither of us liked the illustrations.I was after a book that had a similar quality to the material available at San Francisco's Exploratorium's web site - good diagrams, good scientific explanations, simple experiments. This book was not what we were looking for."
2,not impressed,The shipping was extremely fast. And I have nothing bad to say about the seller. But the product was not what I was expecting. In the description it says learning video. And that the format is dvd. I put it in the dvd player and it started playing music! My son needs to WATCH and learn the ABC's and 123's not learn songs. It was not what was in the description. I don't recommend it if you are wanting an actual video. But if you are wanting music then you would probably like it.
3,"Some good, some tedious",The first listening of this cd was really good. Then it wore a little thin. I wish these sisters would go back to making the great music that they did in the 80's
5,Mom loves it,My mom has a vision problem and can't see a regular calendar. This is the best thing for her!!
3,"For the slow, gradual healing.","Tea tree oil was recommended to me by a doctor who didn't want to prescribe anything for an infected toenail. (Apologies... that may be TMI) It's taken three months to show improvement, but it is getting better. This wasn't a quick cure, by any means, but more of a slow and steady one."
1,The style of sealing ring is different than what was originally in the pressure cooker. It did not work. Big disappointment.,Our pressure cooker is older and the sealing ring did not work. It's not the same style as the one that came with the cooker.
1,Bad Merchandise.,It was so bad I sent it back. Came with a tear in it and it would not fit the pressure cooker lid.
4,A Great Re-Issue,"Originally released in the mid 90's, it was about time to release it in CD. Although the original was released under the Fonovisa label(USA), DISA label(Mexico), I was having a hard time finding it again."
2,not large enough,"this quilt is not large enough for a toddler bed, it is square almost and the bed is rectangular in size, so it doesn't fit right. Not very warm either."
3,Small amount of information,"I do genealogy for a hobby. This book has some good information but it is a very small book so it doesn't have a lot that was useful to me. Still, I learned one important thing - the affect the Erie Canal had on the town. It is worth having to book to learn this."
4,Government money well spent,"The title of this review may seem curious, but I believe the USGS quick response team and observatory are a prime example of what government should do. These folks saved innumerable lives at Pinatubo, and will undoubtedly do so again somewhere else at a place we don't yet know. The book is worth four stars for its description of the people, and the principles they used in thwarting a catastrophe in the Philippines. The narrative of how this eruption, as well as those of Ruiz and St. Helens, were confronted shows how far we've come, and how far we have to go. The villians, if any, are the print-first, save-people-second administrators.The book is a comfortable read, not easily put down. It won't make you a volcanologist, but it will show you how you could be saved by one. A good book, and thought-provoking"
1,Velcro too weak,"After a few weeks the Velcro just would not hold. Now, I always have to carry the bag in my arms. Other than that it is a good looking, solid case. However, I would not recommend it."
3,"Quite nice, but limited","I'm very ambivalent about this case. It's nicely made, feels very solid, and looks good. I like the external pocket for a water bottle. The case is good value for the money (at Amazon's price, anyway). But it doesn't really have enough space in it. Put in a laptop, a power supply, an optical mouse, a pair of headphones, and there is not enough room for much else. I tend to carry around books, a spiral-bound notebook, pens, and other such detritus besides the computer, and this bag doesn't spread out much. I'm looking for something to replace my Kore Gear bag, which is much roomier but is getting long in the tooth -- and more of the same don't seem to be readily available. I'll keep this one around for use when I need it, but it's not the ideal replacement."
3,too much george not enough terry,"I enjoyed about the first half of the book. But once the politican author began using too much of the book for his own agenda (excuses for his wife not being able to find him at night, etc.) I quit reading it. At that point it felt like it was dishonest. I wanted an honest book about someones stuggles, not a book tainted with ""plugs"" about how wonderful their political life and family are. BUT if you can get past that you might enjoy it."
3,Good Video,"This video includes the basics for Black Jack, Craps and Slot machines.It is a good video for Black Jack and Craps, the Slots portion is dated andmay not help in today's casinos (machines with coin payouts and no video poker).I would recommend this video for the Black Jack and Craps, but not for the Slots.The bonus is that James Colburn is the host."
5,"Enlightening Cinderella, beyond the Prince Charming Fantasy",This is the most wonderful book that makes you feel as though it was written just for you. A refreshing little diddy that tells a true story for most of us ( women). You can feel the experiences Suzanne writes about. It is an absolute delite! Her other books are just as good. I highly recomend reading these works of mental art.If you are on a spiritual path this book is for you.
3,Valiant attempmt to recapture old glory,"Musically this is not a bad album. However the English versions of some of the old songs just do not capture the wit of the original Croatian lyrics. After the death of their lead singer Sergio Blazic, Bruno Langer has made several attempts at keeping Atomic Shelter (Atomsko Skloniste) going, this being one of them. And while Steven Birth does a respectable job at lead vocals, he is no Blazic. And, again, with the excepion of a couple of songs, the lyrics here do no justice to this great band."
2,7$ for one pencil,"I thought I was getting a package of 12. To ship one pencil is ridiculous.It's interesting, because I buy alot from Amazon and have told alot of people about you. But someone should have beeb thinking. I was contacted about the mistake, and person was very nice to refind my money. I will continue to shop Amazon before anywhere else. I love you guys."
5,"Shoot, it does not hurt!","This is the best chest protector i've owned. it's light and mannuverable yet, i don't feel anything when shot."
3,It does what it says,"the Chest Protector does exactly what it says, its by no mean a bulletproof shirt, but it does absorb a little bit of impact. if you are looking for total protection this may not be what you should be looking for."
5,Awesome!,I think that this is a great CD because you can work on your singing and improve your skills.
1,unreadable,"I have one of the older kindles (one that has a keyboard), and the book isn't readable. It may be better on a larger kindle or fire."
2,Ehhh,"Just sounds really cheap, not the brand but just this lower level skin... get one with a ring inside, this one doesn't have it and sounds tingy."
4,A new way of learning,This book helps us understand your inner-self. You learn a lot about how you really are and learn how to control new abilities. I would give this book to any women who wants to get in touch with a secret part of their mind. You also learn about history and this helps you to adapt what you've learned in your present life.
3,"nice ideas, too much instruction","Some of the ideas are nice in the book -- building blocks and balls are a nice idea for gift giving, but the instruction was way too lengthy, in some place confusing and (in my learner's opinion) incorrect. I made the ball and I had to refer to another book to be able to decrease correctly -- the decrease instructions in this book read more like pass-over instructions.If you know what you're doing, it's a nice book to flip through for project ideas. If you're learning how to knit, this is not a good purchase at all...the instruction is confusing and limited."
2,Too basic,"I expected a bit more from these authors. The instructions are good, but the designs are basic."
3,Tiny needles = time consuming,"This book is just OK. Unfortunately, many of the patterns require very small needles, which means that these are not quick to knit. The patterns also are very traditional. If you want easy, fast, or hip, then this book is not for you. If you like delicate traditional patterns, you will love it. Not for beginners."
4,Knitting for Baby: 30 Heirloom Projects with Compl...,Great book for the beginning to intermediate knitter. Cute patterns for quick gifts.
5,Love this book,"I don't usually purchase knitting books, with so much stuff online, but this book is great. The patterns are easy to follow, and the projects are adorable and quick to knit. I know I will make different projects in this book for baby shower gifts as well as for knits for my baby."
5,If I can anyone can,"I bought this book while I was expecting my first child. I couldn't resist it, even though I didn't know how to knit. The gorgeous photos of little ones in darling handknits are amazing.By simply reading the book I tought myself to knit. I have made several of the projects and they've all turned out great.The well thought out instructions are very easy to follow.If you have any interest in learning to knit for baby this is the book to buy."
2,Rather disappointing,"I was hoping to see more classic patterns, but alas, I was given 'felted balls' instead. As a spinner, weaver and knitter I was disappointed with the number of actual sweater patterns. If you are looking for patterns, this is not the book for you."
2,Simple book,"The information blurb on this book indicated it had several patterns. Most of the book was devoted to teaching me how to knit. I was looking more for patterns, and not basic instructions."
5,Knitting for Baby: 30 Heirloom Projects with Complete How-to-Knit Instructions by Kristin Nicholas,"A must have baby knit book. many of the patterns I will be knitting, they are lovely, simple and stylish. TKU vendor for speedy delivery in great condition.I am so glad that I bought it.Karen."
3,I'm glad the library had this,"There are a couple of really cute things in here, but the directions were too wordy and long. And 100% cashmere for a baby blanket? Not in my world, at least. Not enough originality to the patterns.I went to the library and checked out the book. I copied a couple of patterns I might attempt (I loved the baby aran sweater). I just didn't think it was a worthwhile addition to my personal knitting library."
4,Baby in - Bugs out,This is a very nice bug net that should fit most baby carriers perfectly. It is Made in Canada and the fit and finish are very good. We have the Chico KeyFit 30 car seat/carrier and this net fits like it was made for it. We often take are little lass for walks on the mosquito infested trails that run through the woods near our home and this net has been a godsend. We put her in the net/carrier and then the carrier on the Bob Stroller and away we go with no bug worries. I really also like that the net is designed to tie to the inside of the carrier's handle which allows your to still use the handle without the net getting in the way. Great product.UPDATE: This Product is now made in China not Canada like our first one... :(
1,Very poor quality,I was very disappointed with this product. The material is of very poor quality - it was not soft to the touch and it was very very fragile. I had to actually return the item as it was already torn when I received it at the part where you are meant to attach the ties to the car seat handle. I could tell by the look of the material that it would rip very easily. I would not recommend this netting at all.
1,Only $6 at Babies R Us for 2,"Bought this exact netting PLUS the stroller one for $5.99 at Babies R Us.The fabric is flimsy because it is MOSQUITO NETTING... anything thicker would not be breathable. I am happy with it, just don't waste your money buying it here."
5,Great Deal,"Does the job well and fits my Chicco Keyfit perfectly. I also get compliments on how it looks. I sometimes leave it on indoors as well to keep small children's hands and faces away from the baby while at the mall, etc."
4,mid-grade aeg,"This is a good gun, its powerful and it keeps people's heads down when you're firing at them during an airsoft war. The scope isnt that good, the mount will just end up braking so i just use the sight on it. The clip holds a lot but it jams a lot, which is annoying during a war."
3,lies,"ok i just got the gun yesturday right and it said 300 fps but on the gun site it said 410 fps, so who do i believe? (sarcasm) anyways people need to put the correct/precise fps on the site."
2,hmmmmmphh,"I originally thought it was a great gun. All my friends were scared of it and people would run when I charged them. But recently it has decreased power and nobody fears it. I have charged it as instructions tell me to, but it lacks power. I have only owned this gun for 10 months!!!!!"
2,great gun... for a short while:(,I ordered this gun on sunday and it came on friday. i took it out and put it together and charged it up and shot a few rounds that night. then i was playing with it for a while the next day put it away charged it up took it out again and somthing in the mag was rattling and it wouldnt shoot. Now it is saturday of the same week and i will send it back Mon or Tues.

4,well g3,"Ive owned this gun for a couple months now and im happy with my purchase. This gun is very good it has a few problems though. 1 it tends to misfire alot on auto,i fired about 10 shots and bbs only came out 4 times, but that can be fixed if you spray the inside of the clip with some type of lube or buy a new one. 2 the clip feels very week it is very light and plastic. This gun is very good for its price. you can hold off alot of people with better guns easly. I faced a utg m14, echo1 x36c, and utg ak47 and i beat them all with ease. this gun is worth the money and is very durable. Also i am not new to airsoft ive been playing for a few years so i know what im talking about."
1,"HORRIBLE GUN.. Breaks easily, doesnt fire.","HORRIBLE GUN.. Breaks easily, doesnt fire and I sent it back to get it fixed and it cost $45...BUT THEY DIDNT FIX IT! it barely fires now, about every 10 times i pull the trigger it fires. and where you put the battery it broke so I have nowhere to put the battery now. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Historical footage is a duck hook,"Although it's wonderful to see and listen to Sam Snead talk about his life, I was hoping for more archival swing footage along the lines of the Hogan Collection. This DVD does not provide that and might be a little misleading in its description."
1,Juicing letdown,I was very excited when I saw this book however when I received it I realized that a majority of the recipes have a TON of fruit. So they are not very healthy. I was pretty disappointed with this book and I'm sad to say I don't even use it.
5,Big Book of Juices,Love this book! It's packed full of helpful info. I've recommended to others who have also purchased copies through Amazon and they love it too!
5,Thanks,Thanks its a really good one! The book has lots a vailble information and smoothies and juices recommendations for different situations. Love it!
4,Good,This book is good if your new to creating smoothies but I wouldn't recommend if your looking for raw green smoothies which is the reason had purchased it.
5,Juicing for everyone,This book has simple recipes for the individual just starting to juice andrecipes for the experienced juicer. Enjoy! ! ! !
4,YUMMIE,Healthy is in. But mixing up tasty drinks is not as easy as it sounds! I found this book super helpful. Plus you can edit as you wish; ad more or less. The recipes make great smoothies and fruit drinks. Not all are for me - but I found three weekly essentials right here. Online helps but in-hand is much easier to keep at it:)
2,Kinda Meh.,I didn't find anything special about this book. Most if not all of the contents can be found with some searching in google and a lot of the recipes don't follow the 60/40 rule (60% veggie 40% fruit). I wish I would have seen this in a store so I could have looked at it first and not purchased it.
4,Great for beginners,"This was the first recipe book that I bought on juicing, and I really enjoy it. It gives a great and easy to understand introduction on juicing and why it is so beneficial. Another great point of the book is the star ratings based on skin, immunity, energy, etc. The back of the book even gives lists of ailments and then tells you corresponding recipes that are good to alleviate the symptoms.The only downside to this book is it is mostly fruit and doesn't have many vegetable juicing recipes. Carrots are used, but for the main ingredients there isn't celery, spinach, parsley, etc. If you're looking for an introduction to juicing and want to get into it slowly, I would recommend starting with this because the fruit mixtures are great and tasty and then you mix a little carrot in them and as you continue, experiment and include more vegetables.Overall, great book!"
3,"Good recipes, but lacking in organization and information","In my opinion this is just a book of recipes thrown together. It reads like a typical cook book. I have been juicing on and off for 10 years now, and there are far more informative books out there than this one. There are some good recipes in here, but it would read much better if it were organized according to her 5 star rating system, such as all the best juices for detox, the best for weight loss, etc. Many people use juicing for a specific reason such as weight loss, ailments, etc. Books that teach what juices are best for what and the recipes available are the best types of books out there. An example would be Juicing for Life by Cherie Colbom."
3,good book,"some facts were left out,this person needs to do more reserch before writing a book about a western out law"
1,,"This is lightweight stuff, alterna-pop music disguised under the Metal banner. Poisonblack continues to be a more an accessible unit that strongly employs melody in every aspect of the music-from the clean vocals to the constant keyboard passages. People have compared them to Sentenced in the past, and while said band is even softer in their musical delivery and pretty much overated, Poisonblack injects a bit more of life into their songs. It doesn't really help their cause, though. You'd have to be a follower of the rock-oriented bands of the Metal genre to really like what this band has to offer. Just don't call it Metal, as it gives a misinterpretation of the whole genre as a whole."
5,For Those Who Long for More Sentenced...,"This new Poisonblack album does have a lot in common with Sentenced's last cd. Mostly due to Ville Laihiala taking over vocals, but also because the music sounds a lot more like the Northernmost Suiciders than, lets say, HIM. Great guitar riffs, leads and raspy, yet melodic vocals. This disc is for those of us who like the Finnish goth metal style, but without those annoying femme falsetto vocals and the pretty boy emo-image. Thankfully Poisonblack is picking up where Sentenced left off. All the songs on this disc are great, but Soul in Flames and The Darkest Lie would have to be my picks for the best. I liked their debut, but this is a huge step forward. Very highly recommended.Tracklist:01. Nothing Else Remains02. Hollow Be My Name03. The Darkest Lie04. Rush05. Nail06. Raivotar07. Soul in Flames08. Pain Becomes Me09. Never Enough10. Love Controlled Despair11. The Living Dead"
2,Sentenced part 2...not Poisonblack,"The title says it all. This is mostly dark, power metal in the same category as Sentenced. I know V. Laihiala was that bands singer, but he should stick to writing and playing those awesome heavy groove laden riffs like the debut cd Escapexstacy. His raspy vocals do not, in my opinion, convey the lyrical content he has written. The lyrics are in the same line as that first cd, and there are moments like ""Raivotar"" that show why his debut was awesome. Bring back the original band, re-record this (J. Kukkonen and J.P. Leppaluoto are part of the soul to that first release) or give me my money back. There is some great playing here, and the artwork is great. If you like Sentenced, raspy vocals do not bother you, and cannot get enough of lead guitar licks from times past.....then by all means buy this. But this, to me, is not Poisonblack."
3,"3,5 stars","Personally i dont like so much classic <> gothic - rock , but im crazy for atmospehric metal . This album is something in between. THey also have some industrial elements in some parts which is not definitely bad. I have to say that i like this album better then their first album which is the most commercial and famous. I rate this album betwwen its just ok (3 stars) and i like it (4 stars) -> so we have 3,5 stars rating."
5,Life after Sentenced,"This is by far one of my favorite albums by Ville even through Sentenced which had alot of awesome records themselves. The dark gothic polished sound mixed with Ville vocals and guitar playing with hidden sounds of Sentenced sounds amazing. From the first song to the last nothing but pure pleasure for the ears.If you happen to like their first album with Charon voalist you will not like this album. A little more tempo and dark ridden guitar riffs with underlying moody keys and Ville's scratchy low melodic vocals will upset previous fans. But Ville pulls off an album that they might not be able to top. It would be awesome if he could but it will be very hard.I can't stop listening to this album, and can't find anything better."
4,Never heard the first album,I really like this album. Metal heads have a bad tendancy to sub catagorize everything and if it isn't in a sub category then they hate it. Well this is like that it's just a Metal CD not too light not to hard. Just good guitar and drum work with good vocals and good songwriting.
2,It's just not the same...,"Remove the vocals and the style is there. It is unmistakenly Poisonblack. But add the vocals (no longer those of Leppäluoto) and what we once knew as Poisonblack is gone.This CD has some great guitar work and some catchy riffs, but Leppäluoto's voice is what made the first CD so great. Now we have Poisonblack style with Sentenced vocals -- it's just not the same."
3,Good Oldie,"Nice book in terms of content, probably one can learn much of the concepts, however it is too old. The examples could not be compiled anymore, without significant effort."
4,"Good on theory, good samples to start out with","With this book, without any previous socket knowledge, I was able to write a functioning socket application for downloading instrument data from a ticker server...however, when it came to a crunch, the samples provided with the Windows SDK were more useful than this book. Still a good book, though."
2,"Better than many books in this field, but still not great.","At first, the book appears to present its information in a fairly intelligent fashion, but when the reader wants to get beyond simple demo applications or the basic principles of socket programming, Ms. Bonner offers little practical advice."
5,Much underrated in GSD literature...,"Perhaps Harts book was overlooked by some due to many other fine releases at, or about the same time. But this book belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the breeding, developing, and history of the breed."
2,Not D'Nealian,"This book is not very good because it doesn't have that many practice pages, there is basically just one line of cursive on each page. More importantly it isn't D'Nealian cursive, which all the schools are using now, so if your child pratices from this book , there may be a slight difference from the way they will learn at school."
4,"Radio Head, Pink Floyd, oh man","All I have to say is that this album is so relaxing. i have it in my playlist next to Opeth and Dying Fetus. This is defintely a good album to get especially if you like Radio Head, Floyd, and Opeth. For some reason they all just blend together. Also Bright Eyes goes with it in some way. If you're a stoner you'll understand.Get this album, you won't regreat it at all."
4,I've been waiting for hours...,"In Absentia is one of those records that you instantly enjoy. The music is all around brilliantly orchestrated and there are no fillers (gotta love some instrumental songs). I really think that Steven Wilson is one of the best musicians out there today. ""Gravity Eyelids"" & ""The Creator Has a Mastertape"" are among personal favorites. I suggest anyone who enjoys this album also check out the band's second c.d ""Up The Downstair"", it's amazing as well."
3,This is not progressive rock,"After hearing a lot about this band being a great new ""progressive"" rock band I went out and picked up this album. I didn't know anything in particular about ""In Abstencia"" but it was all they had at the record shop so I gave it a chance. Needless to say when I listened to it I kept waiting for the progressive part to kick in. It never happened, instead what I got was new alternative rock that a million other bands could have put out. Overall it's not bad for that type of music but it has none of the musical virtuosity or interesting time signature changes or chord progessions that make up what most people think of as progressive rock. The vocals aren't particularly impressive either. I've read that their earlier albums are more traditionally progresive but I can say for certain that In Abstencia is not progressive rock"
3,in absentia- porcupine tfree,"talented group of musicians, not enough keyboards. i understand their messages however it is a bit on the heavy side. could use more keyboards as a part of the overall sound."
3,Progressive? NOT!!!!!!!,Pink Floyd wannabee's with a touch of Radiohead and a pinch of Dream Theater. Sounds good but it's not. It just leaves you wanting something better. Just listen to Symphony X. The most irritating thing about this one is you would also hear touches of Justin Timberlake like vocals or phrasing but very faint which is a no no for prog rock listeners. Genesis with Gabriel did not sound boy bandish not a bit and so does the Alan Parsons Project when they try to sing the queit notes and harmonies..but this one really does. Listen to Dream Theater Instead.
3,Too straight and narrow to often convey the full emotional extent,"3 1/2I was always more a fan of the band's slower, spacious textures, as opposed to their equally indulged hard rock side. The former seems to be able to breathe and penetrate the listener while the latter just seemed to provide relative clunky, plodding contrast. Even so, PT sound committed to putting out ""full"" albums that feel like worthwhile investments for fans; even when songwriting becomes predictable, production breadth never misses sight of treating users to whole experiences."
3,This is not prog,"I don't know why so many people try to lump this album in with prog rock, it simply isn't progressive. It is a good solid rock cd ranging from accoustic numbers to heavy metal but has none of the long complex instrumental interplay of the Flower Kings or early Yes. The recording is clean but a bit too sterile. Alot of people love this cd and it does have a timeless rock quality to it, but for quality progressive rock you must look elsewhere."
3,Not beautiful any more (at least this time),"Dear friends, this release is unfortunately the weakest effort by the band. For the first time there are mediocre tracks, and the best ones (Sound of Muzak, Strip the soul) are just very good songs. I liked PT's going more commercial, with Stupid Dream, since they were an excellent band and deserved success. So they developed a pop/prog sound, instead of the psychedelic/ambient sound of the first 4 albums. In Absentia is the third cd in this fashion, and is considered their most ""rock"" album, and their best. I can't say i agree. Sure it has some metal riffs, nice playing, crystal (dry) sound, but the new ideas are very few, most of the songs are quite mellow (which is not bad), and the word ""repetition"" immediately comes to mind. So, if you're new to PT and looking for their characteristic sound, try their pre-2000 efforts."
3,10 stars for an excellent album as for this...,10 stars for an excellent album as for this item...this dvd is interesting for the first 5 minutes then it just totally wears off. Why would I want the instruments in 5.1 when you see the band in Right and Left channels? I guess these things are more for the tripsters or for just showing off your system. I have star wars for that... Id much rather listen to the original recording. Plus my media room is huge so Im not big on having the music sound so spaced out.
4,A little cold around the art,"I bought In Absentia because several Radiohead reviewers said that PT was vastly superior. Certainly In Absentia lacks the jagged edges, cryptic lyrics, tendency to pretentiousness, inconsistency, and audience-be-damned attitude characteristic of Radiohead, which is exactly why PT is NOT superior.In Absentia consists of a take-no-prisoners band playing take-no-chances music. All the grit and imperfections have wound up in the cover art. Every note, texture, harmony is flawless--to a fault.A band's reach should exceed its grasp."
4,Thoughtful and Enlightened,"Well-written with much variety from song to song. For listeners who appreciate thought-provoking lyrics and musical sounds to accompany those, this should prove to be a worthy purchase. This record would have earned 5 stars; however, I feel that it is possibly slightly too polished during some parts, if there is such a thing (?). I listen to a lot of TOOL, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and this album blends in nicely with such a mix. Enjoy."
5,Amazing,"I had never heard of these guys until a couple of months ago and I am blown away. How anyone could write a bad review of this album clearly has no idea what music is supposed to be. This CD has everything, it's extremely melodic, mellow, hard, they are very good musicians and excellent vocals. This is definately a must have....."
3,Not Good For True Stereo,"If you're an ""old school"" stereo system owner like me as in left and right channels this album with DTS is not for you. All this disc is recorded as a very clear and clean mono sound with instruments mixed together sounding far and near. No instruments or voices are panned either left or right (recording freaks understand what I'm talking about), you will not hear drum rolls from one channel to the other nor the divisions of intruments or voices. This album is made for 5.1 systems if you don't care what it sounds like. If you don't have a ""Decorder"" in computer, than be prepared to get one if you want to listen to this album. It can also be challenging to play on a regular DVD player also. I bought the album because of the ""Bonus Tracks"" which are fantastic, but as far as recording mix it sucks. I have no clue what kind of drugs or what planet Steve Wilson is doing or is living in but it was a bad idea."
4,Porcupine Tree Rules,I have to say that i like all their albums and whenever they release an album i know that it will be good. There is no exception in this album. Especially the first hlf album is really really great and the rser is just good. We have a mix of psychedelice rock + ballads with great sound + some elements of heavy metal in some tracks + progresive rock. A magical album that i recommend anyone to buy.
5,STUNNING IN DTS,"This was an exceptional CD on its initial release and in DTS, it is positively, jaw dropping amazing. Give Steve Wilson credit for writing songs with a sense of dynamics unparalleled among his peers. The conclusion of this DVD-DTS is the most achingly beautiful conclusion to an album since the final 3 minutes of Yes' TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS.The separation of the musical instruments, the sheer surge and emotional force of the use of silence as well as power, the deft touch of the musicians themselves and the material make this in regular CD format a phenomenal record. In this extended definition version, it simply goes beyond description."
5,fantastic album,I am 46 years old and I have a crazy passion for music. I like all genres and types of music. I own about 1400 CD's so that should tell you something. In Absentia is simply incredible. Every song is great!!! What else can I say accept just another great CD by PT. Every CD by this band is awesome. Porcupine Tree are relatively unknown in the US. They are much bigger in Europe because they are from the UK. If you like Pink Floyd or Tool or both then run out and buy all of their CD's!!!! I love Porcupine Tree!!! Steve Wilson is a musical genious!
3,Not prog rock but good,"This ranges from heavy metal to accoustic rock and most of it is good. There is no song here that even hints at being prog rock in the ways of thr Flower Kings or earlier Yes. I don't know why they always show up as a prog band, they are not (not this cd anyway). But it is a good cd for other rock sounds."
4,Saving one of the wonders of the world,"In Absentia feels like a much darker album than it's successor. Critics have written before about the band's attempt to make a concept album about a boy who grows up to be a serial killer. The lead song, ""Blackest Eyes,"" may suggest that but the song itself has a great sound with powerful riffs, while the band create a tripping jam on ""Gravity Eyelids."" ""Trains,"" and ""The Sound of Muzak,"" are two of the band's best cuts with the latter referring to the demise in the quality of music being created today as they sing, ""The music of the future will not entertain. It's only meant to repress and neutralize your brain."" Sadly, the band may be right as they sing how one of the wonders of the world is going down, but with their own brand of progressive metal, Porcupine Tree show sufficient momentum to modernize rock music and make it mainstream again."
4,"Finally, the original Draciel.....","This is a somewhat decent Beyblade. From testing this out, it doesn't seem to win too much. On the bright side this is the one that Max from the show uses first, before using Draciel S. Draciel only won once out of all the times I have tested it. I only recommend this if you're a big Beyblade fan, or if you're collecting the ones from the show. I have most of the ones out right now, except for 3 of them and the retired ones. If I have time I will most likely write some more reviews. Also, THIS IS NOT DRACIEL F, it's Draciel."
4,Draciel Fortress,"The newest installment of Draciel, but not as good as Draciel Shield. I still haven't found out his stats, but I've tried out my friend's and it wasn't that bad. It has metal ball bearings like Draciel Shield, but it's a screw in type. Draciel F is the smallest beyblade so far and has a good endurance too! Good, but Draciel Shield is still better."
3,Draciel,Is quite good but not as good as F version. Its just like a draciel F but no Sharp things on the attack ring
2,not a draciel,"whoever get's this blade, it is not a draciel. my first blade was a draciel s. this is more like a draciel if you like the draciel from the program. so don't waste your money on a foney blade. get draciel s for a okay blade and not the foney draciel."
5,draciel approvel,I think this bey blade is the best one i have one i put the balls in the holes at the bottom and i added some extras to any way you should buy this bey blade it is powerful and can beat almost any one i wish they had some tournaments in this state so i could test its power ...
4,Draciel,"I'm a rookie blader, so this review probably won't be as good as some others, but eh. Anyway, I got this beyblade a couple weeks ago, and in the battles I've been in from then to now (and a few my friend was in since I let her use it), it's worked great. I can't give y'all a definite average, but its won more than its lost. Goes without saying I love it. I recommend anyone buy it."
5,max's blade,don't lissen to what people say this blade ROCKS.If you have theold Draciel take the ball's and but them in the other hole'sthat are in the base besides the other one's that are shownin the direction's.IT ONLY WORKES FOR THE ORIGINAL DRACIEL(the small one).
5,Wonderful!,This book is brightly illustrated and well priced for the high quality. It is a wonderful resourse for parents as well as children. The subject matter covers a broad range of interesting information. Bravo!
5,The best book about KISS I ever read.,"Great book. Read a lot about KISS in Black Diamond I did not know about the band. I have read other books about KISS,but they were not as informative or went in to such detail as Black Diamond did. If Black Diamond 3 is as informative as Black Diamond 1,2 it should be a great book. The CD on Eric Carr that came with Black Diamond 1 was great,but I read the same thing in the book. The CD should have been different then the book."
4,Superb book with a lot of details for the die hard Kiss fan,"This is a superb book with a lot of details in the history of the greatest rock group ever. The covering of Kiss in the 70's is extremly informative and gives the impression of good research from the author. The only thing which prevents me from giving the book a maximum rate is the lack of the author's covering of the critical phases in the history of Kiss: When members of the group left, when Kiss decided to drop the make-up, the leading to the reunion and and the decission to put on the make-up again. These are the fractions of the story which the die hard Kiss fans want as much as possible information about. ...but let there be no doubt: This IS (by far) the best unauthorized biography of Kiss"
5,This is the best book about Kiss ever written.,Well researched and very insightful. I could not put this book down
4,A good read amongst all the KISS books out there!,"Black Diamond is a good read for die-hard KISS fans only. It's up there on my top ten list for an all KISS book. Compared amongst other books like KISS and Sell, it's a better read. My favorite amongst all the Kiss books is KISS & Tell by Gebert and McAdams... NOW THAT'S A CLASSIC ROCK BOOK. I rate that a must-read for all rock fans (not just Ace/Kiss fans).My list of KISS reading would be KISS & Tell first, Black Diamond and Black Diamond II (for the Kiss collectable people out there)."
4,An insightful look from a dedicated fan,"It's no secret that Dale Sherman is a fan of the band KISS. He has spent many years chronicling their exploits and has put his fandom to good use here. While there may be many trivial details, they are all of interest to a KISS fan. I would rather see a book written by someone who has an appreciation of the band rather than some cold, analytical Bob Woodward type. Maybe Dale's fandom shows a little too much at times, but there's no denying the depth that this book has."
2,GREAT TRY BUT...,"The small type letters alone are a pain in the a..., but the author really tried to write a good unauthorized bio. Of course none of the members were interviewed for this book. The main sources are interviews conceded for magazines, TV's, etc. You end up really thinking tha Stanley and Simmons are nothing more than greedy money machines who just want take every cent out of their fans'pockets. If this is true, I don't know."
2,Disappointing,"This book was pretty disappointing overall. There have been much better KISS bios out there like ""KISS & SELL"". This is poorly written, poorly produced, and very negative. The author makes a lot of statements but doesn't back up many of them with facts.His second book, ""Black Diamond II"" is much better as it concentrates on KISS collectibles."
5,The best biography yet...,"When I bought this book, I assumed it was just another biography. Was I wrong! Dale Sherman has spent years researching the ""hottest band in the world,"" and I think he did an excellent job. I am extremely happy that the book talks chapters on the late Eric Carr - the man that is often overlooked in KISStory. Then again, he goes into the details of all the obscure members. Over all, I must give it a 5 becaue it taught me things, and thats hard to do with KISS."
4,Excellent fan-based book!,"Dale Sherman's ""Black Diamond"" is the definitive Unauthorized KISS book for the fans, by a fan. The text has a few accuracy problems, but they're small, and the fact that a CD is included (with a rare interview with KISS drummer Eric Carr, who died in 1991)boosts fans' interest. Not as dry as its main authorized competitor, KISS AND SELL. Very good source for early KISStory."
4,A bargain at half the price!,"Dale Sherman crams a lot of information into this book, starting the band's prehistory and going all the way to reunion in 1995. Anyone curious about the personalities involved, both in the band and behind the scenes, will find a lot here.BUT: It's poorly written and badly designed. The black-and-white pictures are shabby, and the block quotes are in a bold font that jars the eye. Between that and Sherman's inept use of the language, it's a hard read. The information is there, but not presented at all well. Plus, the binding is cheap and will fall apart after one read.Even at Amazon's discount, the book's general cheapness makes it not worth the price."
3,"Full of ""facts"" that don't make for an interesting read.","The author is obviously a fan of the band, & has crammed a ton of inane facts about them into this book. I had a very hard time getting through because it reads like a text book at points, throwing statistical information at you. The selling point for me was the CD interview with Eric Carr, it was interesting to hear Eric's voice & to hear his views on a small part of the band's history."
3,Wonderful Piece in an Adequate Recording,"Perhaps Britten's finest work is rarely performed and rarely heard of, but for those acquainted with Britten, it is a must have. It is the most magical, moving and haunting piece written for small orchestra and vocalists. The redemption scene at the end in which a madwoman's madness is absolved is of such beauty and power it leaves you breathless.However, this recording does not show the piece to it's full potential. The performances while vocally strong, have brash, harsh and annoying ""old men belting"" sounds. Even the wonderful Peter Pearce is not at his best here, where his performance of the madwoman is just too sane and slightly cold and nasal. Occasionally, the diction is unclear too (perhaps due to the nature of the piece), and the band/orchestra lacks flow, fluidity and sensitivity.However, I would still urge any enthusiast in 20th Century opera to buy this!"
2,Basement Britten,I like a lot of Britten's music; particularly his operas and religious music. This piece I didn't care for much. It's just a little too experimental (i.e. static and dull) to hold my attention.
4,Great Sharpener,"I purchased this sharpener almost 10 years ago and was skeptical at first. I paid $20 in a sporting goods store and figured for something so small it was worth the money. At first I hated it because it did not sharpen the way I thought it would but after actually reading the instructions I found that it was a polisher, not a sharpener. This gives you a much cleaner and longer lasting edge than other traditional sharpeners. Now that I've found it on amazon I'm stocking up for many years to come."
4,Review of sharpener,This sharpener is compact and I like it for that fact. It arrived when they said that it would. Thanks.
4,Great sharpener for the price.,"Sharpens well and is very durable.PROBLEM: Does not work on small blades (under 3 inches and thin)!!! The smaller blades go through the angles stones, but it works great on regular to big blades."
5,Almost perfect little sharpener,"Let me start off by saying that it works great, and it's cheap. You could buy a few and stash them in various places for the price of a more expensive model. This is my camping sharpener. I sharpen a Mora TopQ with it, and it does the job flawlessly. The ONLY gripe I have is that the opening will not allow a thicker blade to be sharpened. It's just a bit narrow for things such as a boot knife, but that's not a concern to me."
1,"stopped sharpening after first use, come on Gerber you're supposed to be better than that!","I bought this Gerber pocket sharpener to go along with the 6 dollar hunting knife with a firestarter after putting an edge on the hunting knife 1 time the grain on the two bars you're supposed to run the knife through war off, whatever idiot you hired thinks he can make you a bunch of money by selling cheap product needs to be fired as soon as possible the only thing you will get it the destruction of the good gerber name."
1,Not worth it,"I'm looking for a good pocket sharpener. This isn't it, since it pretty much has no effect on the edge of any knife I tried with it. I have a mini ceramic stick type that works better, but it isn't my ideal, either."
2,Yuck,"You get what you pay for folks. If you sat down and repeated the sharpening motion for three hours, you might start to notice a difference."
3,Do Not Buy!,"I got this to put in my bag but the first time i used it, I found that the mouth is not wide enough to my fit my 1/4 inch thick tactical knife. If you buy this, you might regret it. It wont even get your blade sharp!"
3,another fruity-sounding Canterbury group,"Combining Dadaesque jazz with very whimsical lyrics, Gong was far too unfocused a band to ever make it in the United States. For a ""hippie band"", though, they could play pretty well... Steve Hillage featured some tasty fusion-style guitar in this band, and drummers Pip Pyle and Pierre Motien both were very talented. Sax/flute player Didier Malherbe at times sounds uncannily like Mel Collins of King Crimson--similar influences, I guess-- and at other times (when Gong was playing 'yoga atmospherics' ) he apes Yusef Lateef.There are times when the band plays like the Mothers of Invention, and other instances when ""Islands"" period King Crimson comes to mind, with Gilli Smyth's eerie wails being a bit like Pauline Lucas' siren-style vocals on Crimson's ""Formentara Lady"".Gilli Smyth's distinctly feminist presence is another factor that makes Gong noteworthy.On the whole though, this is a band I find merely interesting, not essential."
4,absolllluuuutely the best,"They weren't kidding when they named this CD absolutely the best. First of all, it is a 2 cd set, you gotta love that. I got to see this band in England in the mid '70s and I have listened to them on and off ever since. I noticed this new CD and really enjoyed listening to them again. With long-living hits like ""the isle of everwhere"", I just cant get enough. No one plays like they do, all trippy and light-styled."
5,Invaluable!,"I consider this book to be the ideal companion to ""The Missing Manual"". Indeed, ""Running Mac OS X Panther"" is the Red Pill for Mac OS X users because it takes you beneath the applications into the Panther underworld where all the interesting stuff happens. I found the depth of the book's content to be truly unique. From Panther's killer app -- the Terminal -- to working with Open Directory, reading through the book was a journey that quickly transformed me from a mainstream Mac junkie into an enlightened power user.Take the Red Pill. You'll be glad you did."
2,don't quite see where it fits,"This book is supposed to fall in some middle ground between a Mac OSX manual (Like Pogue's Missing Manual on OSX) and the hard core extreme Mac-OSX-as-another-Unix-system (as typified in Mac OSX Unleashed or the OSX Nutshell handbook or the under-rated Unx for Mac OSX by Enzer). However, I think it just ends up neither fish nor fowl. Not really a Mac OSX manual because it is much too short for that, and not nearly as detailed as other books that get into much more depth on the Unix aspects of OSX. I would suggest getting the OSX Missing Manual (or Robin Williams OSX book) and then supplementing that with Enzer's book or Mac OSX unleashed."
2,NOT nearly as good as War Birth,"I was dissapointed by this Lp. War Birth is a really good album and I held out alot of hope for this Lp, but it just doesn't quite do it for me. The majority of the songs sound the same. The ""chorus"" style vocals get very boring, very fast. There was a spark to War birth that is missing with ""The World""."
2,Pretty dull.,"Most of the songs on this album sound almost exactly the same. Also, most of the songs sound like a lame attempt to rip of the Clash and other early British punk bands. Overall, The World is pretty monotonous and boring, especially if you're used to hearing classic British punk and not the revitalists. Back at the Laundromat is a much, much better album and is recommended."
5,Great styling product,After years of switching between styling products i finally found my perfect product and it is the redken rough paste. Great hold without the hardness you get from gels. 5 Stars.
5,The best accordionist today...,"Nacho Hernandez is the best accordion player there is. Many can try to imitate his style, but nobody will ever sound like him."
5,High quality but low price!,"these brake pliers work great! very sturdy, quality feel, dont bend or flex even with the hardest of springs. wouldnt expect anything less from Lisle."
1,Lisle 11260,"I was putting brake shoes springs on a 1958 Desoto, although these springs have 5 coils and are fairly stiff the arm with the hook bent. I borrowed a pair of SnapOnfrom a friend of mine and had no problens."
1,Concert of American In Paris and Rapsody in Blue,this was a terrible recording with an idiot doing the sound level monitoring. Loved the interpertation of the music but the alternating horrible loudness and sudden softness where you could not hear any music was distracting.
5,Makes understanding poetry easy,"Many of us have had the experience in high school of being forced to ""appreciate"" poetry with a lot of terminology and concepts that were hard to understand. This books lays it all out so simply, and has made it possible for me to finally, really appreciate poetry and its forms. The bits of wit and charm at the beginning of each section keep the book's tone light. Five stars!"
1,Rip off,"I paid $66.88 for a recharger and battery ( over priced) I receive just a battery no charger ok we all make mistakes I said ok no refund just resend my order, they resend the order no chargeonce again they send a battery no charger I really needed this for my camera I sent them both back and bought the battery and recharger somewhere else and said I want a refund I get a email back saying your not getting a refund we will send you another one I don't need another one because I bought and received one already now I have to call my credit card company to get my money back because they will not refund my money"
5,This bra is a savior for women who must feed!,This bra keeps my breasts very comfortable and makes it easier to feed in public.
5,Amazing for neck pain,My husband originally ordered one for his neck pain. He has tried so many different pillows and loves this one. I just ordered 2 for my parents as a gift and they both agreed that this has helped their neck pain. I will be ordering one for myself.
2,Cool idea...but I won't waste my money on another one,"I've purchased two of these. The first one I used for quite a while and loved it until it just stopped transmitting one day. I purchased another and within just a few months it stopped transmitting too! I messed around with them both trying to see if there was a problem with my iPod or the station, but they just don't work. I love that it doesn't take batteries or require a cord, it's sleek and fits my mini perfectly, but I won't waste my money on another one just to have it quit in a few months time!"
1,Great performance - terrible mastering,"Great performance - terrible mastering, November 15, 2005Reviewer: J. Kauffman (Haddonfield, NJ USA) - See all my reviewsI don't know what Naxos is thinking (or hearing) but yhey are doing a really awful job on their remasterings of the early 50s Gilbert and Sullivan recordings. Thin sounding and cramped - little surface noise but a whole layer of life is gone from the recordings. A comparison with the incomparably better Sounds on CD mastering is telling - the Naxos is cheaper and they sound it - in this case, you get what you pay for."
5,Great resource- better than many books on the subject,"I am a pediatrician with 2 ADHD children. Although I have alot of technical knowledge on the subject, I have found this magazine extremely helpful in terms of suggestions for problem-solving day-to-day issues, and keeping things in perspective (if they discuss the same problems we're having in a magazine, then the challenges my kids face and my less-than-perfect parenting are not failures of discipline and self-control- we're just part of the ADHD community!) Very straightforward, balanced, but mainstream viewpoint. Lots of practical articles about living with ADHD in all settings and behavioral/ cognitive interventions. Doesn't push medication, although it does provide information and tips on dealing with side-effects. Also light on coverage of alternative therapies. Plenty for both affected adults, teens and parents of ADHD children."
5,ADDitude Helps!,"I am the single parent of two ADD youngsters. This publication has wonderful information and helpful hints for coping with the challenges and wonderments that are presented when raising a child with ADD. The magazine covers all ages, young through college."
3,It's ok,As time goes on I am finding the articles less and less engaging. I'm no longer excited to get my magazine.
4,Dear DesintyChild I loves your new song Bills Bills Bill,Destiny I love your song nononono . I relly like your nwe song bills bills bills
1,A flavor of the week man-slam.,"No wonder male/female relationships are in disarray, when songs like this are produced and marketed to a teeny-bopper audience. Notice--it also cheapens the potential of what the group's name ""Destiny's Child"" could be. I feel kinda ashamed for these ladies, but not much. Kinda reminds me of those stories of blues musicians selling their souls to the Devil for recognition. All the great artists, ladies, the ones with longevity and with songs memorable throughout the ages, had something more going for them than trying to get record sells by being provocative--you'll soon find."
5,Destiny's Child has done it again!,"Destiny's Child and Bills, Bills, Bills it just off the chain! Everyone likes it, so now the males know the females want a man at least a little money! But you can't blame them for keepin' it real for life!"
5,This song is the bomb,a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a a a a a aa a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m mm m m m mm m m m m m m mmm m m m m m m m m m m m m mm m m m m m m m m m m m m m mm m m m mm m m m mm m m mmmmbbhvnv n v v v b v vv v v v vv v v v v vv v v v v vv v v v v v v vv v v v v v v v v v v v v v
3,Similar to No Scrubs...,"I used to be a former music director at my college radio station not too long ago. I heard of this one coming when I heard a few west coast stations playing it. Timbaland's production is quite evident in the song, and that's probably what makes it so good. The girls are bashing men that won't pay their bills. (yeah--that's a new one) It is similar to no scrubs in that way. Of course, it would be nice if my girfriend would pay some of my bills. It's a catchy song, but like Tim's songs, you can bounce to it, not necessarily dance to it. Expect some trio male group to bash this song just like SportyThievz did to TLC w/ No Scrubs. KrazyKidClutch '99 Music Director--106.1 FM JAMZ --Bloomington-Normal, IL."
4,The really got what they wanted to say across to the world,"When I first heard them I fell in love with there voice. Which is heard on ""Lately"" The son :Bills. Bills, Bills,"" It was what I needed to hear Good Job girls and keep it up"
3,better buy the cd single but the import,the remix is the better buy because the original sound is the same crap you heard everyday
5,I liked this song very much.,"I liked it very much, I wanna buy the cd because of this. They remind me of En Vogue."
4,I love this group and the song and I think it's great,I think the song is great a to you ladies keep doing what your doing because you are all beautiful and your songs are great.
3,Meh...,"Looking back at it, I'm not sure what I thought this stuff would do... So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't appear to do anything. As other reviewers noted, it smells good and leaves your face feeling fresh- but after a month of using it twice per week, I haven't noticed any long term effects. My skin looks the same & is no more or less clear than it was. I'll use it all, but unless there are some noticeable benefits soon I will not purchase more."
3,It's...uhhh...ok,"Ok, first things first, it's got music you've heard of. Great. It's got bad graphics. Paula looks like an old Charlie Brown Comic. Simon looks like a pixelated monster. Randy is the worst, he looks like a Hershey Kiss. Bad. The singing, bad. Even if you've got all of them happy faces, you're pitch is like someone on a trampoline, up and down. This would work great on the Nintendo DS. 64-bit graphics. YESS! Sound, you would sing, the DS has a microphone! Ahhh.... I can only dream. For now I recomend Karaoke Revolution Party. Bye"
4,This game is horrible,i can not believe how unbelievably boring this game is...i tried to keep playing it to see if it got better but it didnt...i seriously do not recomend this game
1,worse than 1 star,"If I could give this garbage a ""zero star"" rating, I would. It is that bad. This is one of those titles that is simply trying to cash-in on a successful show. Shame on you, American Idol. The show is a hit, big ratings = big money. This game, on the other hand, is pure crap. Do not rent, do not buy."
4,Good....but hard,I love this game! It's challenging and absolutely nothing like the show. You have to work at it and it can get boring but when you finally win you feel so accomplished!!!!
4,Excellent Book...but....,"This is an excellent book for training with Martial Art equipment (heavy bag, bad drills, foam pads...) Dan Inosanto using Jeet Kune Do technics offer powerful and basic technics for any marial arts and street fight combat sports. This book is recommended for anyone who wants to seriously train on an heavy bag and other equipment. The only problem is that out off 24 drills only 7 are using the left lead. This might be confusing for beginners who are right handed (using left lead) and who want to focus on their position. But this can be adjusted by having a pro spending 5 minutes showing you how to adapt by working both leads. Intermediate and advanced martial artists will adjust both leads very easily. Conclusion: A Great Book ! Thanks to Dan and Bruce !"
5,awesome product.. especially for single people!,I love my foodsaver.. in fact this is my second. The first model I bought worked well... but it was very simple. I prefer this one because it has more options... and it holds a roll of bags inside. My only wish is that I bought the black one.. because somehow I stained the casing. I rubbed it down with some bleach sprayed on a towel and let it sit overnight.. and the stain remained. I found all the included containers to be of great use.. except the mason jar one. It has never worked for me... or for friends of mine who also own foodsavers. Regardless.. it's worth buying!
1,Died after three weeks,"For the first three weeks I was very happy with this product. It sealed both bags and canisters quickly and efficiently.However three weeks after getting it, it completely stopped working. Fortunately Amazon has a very good return policy so I will be getting a replacement. When I get the new one I will give another review after having it a few month or until it dies again.The FoodSavers used to be made in Italy. Now they are made in China and some people have told me that the quality control has really dropped off"
4,Great value,This wallet is a great value as it is very difficult for me to find a wallet I like and a price I like as well. This one offers all I need with multiple pockets for cards and id's as well as hidden slots for those things you rarely need to pull out. You will not be disapointed in this one. I am VERY hard to please and this one has made me a happy camper!
4,"snazzy looking wallet, a little on the large side","This wallet is definitely an eyecatcher. The colour and style make it very unique and hip. However, it was a little larger than I expected, but that didn't take long to get used to."
2,Doesn't hold money well - sort of a problem for a wallet,"I really like the look of this wallet, which was why I bought it. It's got attractive leather and lots of pockets for cards. Unfortunately its space for holding cash is inexplicably too small. You can cram it in there, but it's really hard. Despite that fact the wallet is also annoyingly large. Sure it fits in your jeans, but just barely, and when you sit down it's like sitting on someone's hand. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have tiny cash and huge back pockets."
1,Disappointing,"For you who read the review,it's not what you expected it is. If you expect ""greatest hits"" the only one you'll find is Time to say goodbye. No ""The prayer"" or any from Romanza or Sogno Album. It's very disappointing if you expect Andrea Bocelli's ""greatest hits""."
5,dillinger grooves,"Under Heavy manners encompasses the long, prolific career of Dillinger, a reggae great. He puts together some of the most hilarious and clever lyrics. The record contains some of his most recognizable hits, like ""Plantation Heights"" and ""Cocaine in my Brain"". This is a great buy for reggae fans and anyone who wants to listen to some up-beat, groovy tunes."
3,Cutie...but,"I'm too big for them. It says one size fits all... NOPE... I gave them to my little sister.. She loves them. I wish i cound wear 'em, since i paid for them."
1,Rip...OFF!!!,"This is a one page long ""article"" that basically says ""Sexual dysfunction can have many causes, psychological or physiological. The end!"" And they charge you $3.10 for this. Seriously, I've found much, much, MUCH more information on the internet... even Yahoo Answers, for crying out loud... for free. If you're looking for books or info on sexual dysfunction, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! If you're searching for that kind of book, you already know everything this ""publication"" has to offer."
1,THE MORMON CONSPIRACY,"This book is full of trash talk, The author just hates the mormon church, Who knows why?."
1,A Book Marred by Prejudice and Ignorance,"Charles Wood knows almost nothing about Mormonism but what he has read in openly anti-Mormon sources. His alleged conspiracy theory is generally of the same order as most conspiracy theories throughout history: paranoid, fanatical, and blind. It would match well with ""The Protocol of the Elders of Zion,"" a notorious anti-Semitic forgery. If this book had been written about any other faith in America, it would have been condemned as bigoted. But when it comes to attacking the Mormons, the normal boundaries of decency evidently do not apply. I suggest readers actually read The Book of Mormon or watch a televised worldwide conference of the Church before they jump to extreme and unwarranted conclusions."
1,"Shrill, paranoid, shallow thinking","As a holder of a doctoral degree myself, from the University of Washington, and having had additional training on fellowship at Stanford University, I think my academic training is superior to that of this dubious writer. At least, it gives me a valid basis for commenting.In his writing, Wood never takes a breath, or any other pause for serious reflection. He manifests no rational evaluation of competing thoughts on any page of the text; he merely spews a haphazard series of diatribes. Wood provides no new insights, but merely repeats Fawn Brodie's outdated and questionable citations to the 19th-century equivalents of National Enquirer sources.Wood's fiery accusations provide dim light, at best."
1,A complete joke,This book can be proven wrong in so many ways I don't even know where to begin. The protestant author has an obvious bias against the LDS church. There are many religions with much more power and political pull than mormons. This is just one more conspiracy book not worth reading.
3,Dwells on the Equal Rights Amendment,"Dr. Wood gives a good analysis of the designs of the Mormon corporation towards the federal US government. However, Dr. Wood dwells on the ERA over 20 years after its ratification was finally blocked. Dr. Wood appears to have a bias against Christians as well as Mormons. While a lot of good history abounds about the Mormon corporation and its leadership's heavy handedness at dissent, it appears that Dr. Wood's book is more a lamentation about the failed ERA to the US Constitution. Dr. Wood appears to be an advocate for unfettered democracy,as opposed to a Constitutional republic where the rights of minourities are protected from the whims of an emotional majourity. I recommend Richard Abanes' book _One_Nation_Under_Gods_ in lieu of Dr. Wood's tome."
1,Blasphemy,"You think that anyone with enough courage to learn about a religion would learn about it from those who actually know what they are talking about, and practice what they preach. I think it's funny that people will listen to lies from anyone and then spread them around as truth without going to the real source for the answer. If you want to know about catholics, ask a faithful catholic. If you want to learn about mormons, ask a faithful mormon. Common sense here."
3,Havent read yet - sorry - my fault,"I am in nursing school, last semester, and unfortuently have not had time to even start reading this book. It looked good when I ordered it and then I got busy and could not read it when it came in. I score it a 3 only because I have to give it something to rate it. In actuality it could be much better or worse. Someone else read it and tell me if it is any good."
2,"The message is worth heeding, but...","Dr. Wood's ""The Mormon Conspiracy"" is a short presentation of the history and modern agenda of the Mormon Church -- an agenda that is often glossed over or altogether ignored by mainstream society. As Dr. Wood repeatedly asserts, the LDS church's agenda is -- at best -- questionable, and -- at worst -- unseemly. Although I found his claims consistent w/ some of my observations, there are other books that temper Dr. Wood's rant-like writing style with cold, objective, fact presentation. Two such books are Brodie's ""No Man Knows My History"" and Abanes' ""One Nation Under Gods"". I gave Dr. Wood's book two stars simply because the book does not reflect the writing style of someone w/ a Ph.D. A cursory edit of the manuscript prior to publication could have gone a long way!"
1,"If you are anti-Mormon, pro-hatred and false information... this is the book for you.","It is interesting to me that in this day and age, people feel justified in the blatant bashing of another's religious beliefs. This kind of bigotry would never be tolerated against any other religion or people. I am deeply saddened by the writers and publishers of this and other hate-filled books and by all those who endorse them. The reader will find little to no accurate information on Mormonism in this book- a writing that is clearly based on an anti-Mormon agenda. For ACCURATE information about the Mormon church (or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as it is properly called) try reading something that is actually written BY them and not AGAINST them."
1,Misrepresentation,"I only read the introduction to this book, but what I read was ridiculous. Several aspects of 'Mormonism' (not its' true name) are severely misrepresented by the author, obviously NOT an expert in this area. I compare it with politics - if you want to understand the Democrats' stand on an issue, don't ask the Republicans - they will only have dirt to throw. I think a lot of people should think for themselves on things like these instead of accepting anything they see with a cover - we should be very wary of authors such as Wood who only seek to incite people against each other. Read it if you like, but in finding several inconsistencies in the introduction alone, I would caution you to not blindly accept this. Use your own God-given sense of reason and study it using other sources and compare this sharply inflammatory book with others that are more moderate - otherwise you'll be carried along with the author to conclusion that are not true."
3,An 'Okay' Anthology,"If you want this anthology to add to your collection, I recommend finding a used copy rather than paying the full price.The stories were okay. None seemed to jump out at me nor stay with me.Some may enjoy the ""fillers"". I'm not one of them. The first story doesn't start until page 85 of the book. First, you get the year in horror. The last story begins on page 467 and ends on page 524. The rest is filler. Who died in 2002 and then pages of useful addresses.Just know that the size of the book is not all comprised of stories. It's deceiving."
5,New leaves of the old maple...,"Jeffrey Harrison's beautiful letterpress chapbook of poems An Undertaking, is a tight sequence that moves through the immediate shadow of his brother's suicide. The tone is measured, attentive to facts and details as Harrison navigates a complex process that puts the five stages of grief to shame. His is the aftermath life, the forever stage of being ""constantly aware"" of his brother's death. The poems seem stark and spare with a kind of honoring bluntness, and that is their honesty: there is no way to be lush enough to flesh out with words, bring back to life. With a kind of lyric pointillism, the sequence moves through the call, telling the children, reading the note, sorting belongings and socks, wearing the brother's ring, returning to the note.... Harrison knows it's a deceptive thoroughness. Poets have long and un-relentingly written about what is beyond explanation and here Harrison is right at home. A finely printed edition."
4,A pleasant surprise.,"This was a required text for a college course. It has been like visiting old friends. The ""classic"" authors and others I'd never heard of provide a very good read, and the insights into writing by some of the authors is helpful."
1,Save your money,"If you are looking for tips to improve your writing, look elsewhere.The 'instructions' could all fit on one page and consist of such helpful hints as ""choose your voice, point of view, and setting...the choice is entirely up to you"". ""Write a rough draft..."" ""Edit your draft for logic, clarity, and plausibility."" ""Continually read excellent fiction.""The section of exercises is simply a list of 20 topics with this instruction: ""Write a very short story about one of the following:""The glossary is less than two pages long and has no examples.I was expecting each story to have an introduction that told me why it is a masterpiece and what to look for. There is an index of stories by voice, point of view and setting. Those are fairly obvious.Another sad lesson in not judging a book by its cover."
2,Full of chemicals,"There was scant information available online about Urth Face Balm. I was hoping for the best - i.e., something not full of oxybenzone. Unfortunately, this isn't it. For the price, I was hoping for better. Yes, it smells quite nice and has a good consistency, but for this price I expected something that had fewer chemical ingredients than an $8 tube of Neutrogena."
5,Ummm....incredible,This stuff is inspirational. Worth eery penny. Nothing has ever touched my face that smells better
2,Misleading picture,"This is the girls watch, picture makes it look like a guys. Was not happy to have to return and pay a $15 restocking fee because they can't properly advertise their product. I found the guys version on ebay. Like most watches it should say men's or ladie's."
5,"You won't be hitting bunker shots like Player, but . . .","You won't be hitting bunker shots like those Player is famed for nailing, but you will pick up some great tips and enjoy doing so with one of the most personable members of Golf's Big Three."
4,rediscover burroughs,"I picked this book up after reading a few other biograpies by Bockris, and, although I can say that I am bored by Burroughs the writer, I am facinated by Burroughs the man. Always interesting and funny, you don't have to be a fan of William Burroughs' writing to be intrigued by his personality and intelligence."
4,Good Reference,Good reference. I wish it was a little more detailed (I'm a dental student) but it gives a good overview of anatomical structures.
2,not a good book for the exam.,"Very insiteful book for windows 98, but not enough information for the exam."
2,Didn't cover the test,"The book was pretty good I must say and I did gain a lot of knowledge from it. BUT!! The test did not even touch base with the book! A lot of the test questions were asking about things that were not even mentioned once in the book. It's a good thing I had a good grasp of Win 98 before taking the test. Also,CTA, where I took the test was very unprofessional and noisy. The secratary was flirting with the security guard next to the testing room and putting everyone on hold. From Hawaii"
2,Sloppy,"I found many aggravating errors/inconsistencies in this book. Many typos and contradictions makes one onder how throughly this book was proofread. Further, many topics are simply a rehashing of a number concepts covered in other books of the same publisher, such as the osi model. These topics are not on the exam and serve only to waist the time of anyone interested in the material on the exam. On a positive note, there is a large amount of information contained in this book, however, I feel it is most useful as a reference guide rather than as an exam prep."
3,Gunning For Melodies,"The Minus 5's eponymous album is not quite up to the standards of their two best works, In Rock & Down With Wilco, but is still a strong collection of songs. Scott McCaughey puts the musical stylings all over the map from the Beatlesque sounds of ""Out There On The Maroon"", ""My Life As A Creep"" and ""All Worn Out"" to the Exile On Main Street sounding ""Cigarettes Coffee and Booze"" to the punkish ""Aw Sh*t Man"" to the plain weird sounding ""Hotel Senator"". The Decembrists' Colin Meloy sings lead on ""Cemetery Row"" and the boys from Wilco add depth to ""With A Gun"". The opening track ""Rifle Called Goodbye"" is the best song on the album followed closely by the twangy ""Twilight Distillery""."
2,not so good,"There are certainly some catchy songs on this record, but I would categorize most as filler that could have been cut. You can tell which songs were written by different members- there are some that are repetitive Beatle-album-cut sort of songs (the ones that should have been left off the record IMHO) and the countryfied ones that are great, memorable, and should the whole album have had the same treatment with pedal steel, organ, etc, it would have been a lot more cohesive."
1,My Least Favorite,"I absolutely LOVE cocktail sauce. But this has to be my least favorite. I LOVE Texas Pete's sauce and McCormick cocktail sauce is much better than this one. I didn't really taste the horseradish flavor which I love. Mmm, horseradish, vinegar, and tomato! It doesn't have a strong of a taste as the others do."
2,B. Harris,"Dunnavant just doesn't deliver with his enamoured account of Bryant.I suggest ""The Last Coach: A Life of Paul ""Bear"" Bryant"" by Allen Barra."
5,Great Book,This is a great book as written by Keith Dunnavent. It really puts you in touch with a side of the Bear that I didn't know
5,Photo quality,"These print beautifully. They're a little expensive, but very professional looking. If your card has color graphics, these shine! If it doesn't, then you should rethink your design. Your business card is no place to economize, because often it's the only impression a future customer has of you. Stand out!"
2,Avery glossy business cards # 8373,Have wasted almost an entire pack trying to print on my HP Deskjet 3520. HP said the roller isn't accurate in feeding due to the glossy side and there was not a fix yet. Other than to try and feed manually thru printer. Even tho I tweaked software in every program I used;they simply didn't work for me. Think I'll avoid the glossy stuff.
5,Business Cards,Prints very well and has a very professional appearance to it. When needed I will purchase this same item again and again.
2,One sided only and not true to edge,"I have used numerous Avery products and been hapy with them but these ""print to the edge"" do not totally match up with the template so don't print well AND the other side is glossy and cannot be printed... that should be noted on the package as ""one side print"" as I knew I wanted to ptint on the back when I bought them. Avery does not curently have a 2-sided edge printed card available. I will say the do tear apart nicely.I have an HP printer- a previous reviewer said it was an HP issue- HP said they weren't aware of an issue with their roller."
1,Not what I expected,"I was trying to order business card which I could print on both sides. When I searched on the ""Avery 8859"" several items showed up which led me to beleave that they were all 8859.They were NOT!So when I got my shipment and found that I had the wrong item I had to go through the process of returning it and then sourcing the Avery 8859 from somplace else.Amazon was very misleading with the way the items where displayed."
4,Naughty enough,"Well, I'm not French, but I'm a certified francophile and I enjoyed the feeling of knowing what a typical French person knows, supposedly. Although there are some words that are probably region-sensitive, because one time, my friends and I wanted to have fun during a birthday of a French friend and he couldn't get the joke! Just like his other books Street French 1 and 2, Burke tries to give a close translation to the words--not an easy feat. This book is definitely for those who might want to keep a vocabulary of naughty things for fun."
1,one hit wonders,i bought this lp 4 no pigeonz xpectin there to be otha good stuff on here. but o was i in 4 a surprise. it was simply horrible.cheapskate was the only othere song i could manage to listen to. sporty thievs are not lyricists and cannot pick beatz whatsoever. i'll admitit maybe this review is a bit harsh but they trul deserveit. they're a disgrace to rap. they remind me of the queer weird al yankovic jockin off otha songs. do urself a favor. DON'T BUY THIS TRASH AND IF U DO U'LL REGRET IT!
4,Good,"If you like basic New York rap (Nas, BIG, Mobb Deep) this album is for you. Lots of undrrated tracks on this joint."
2,Nothing new here.,"I guess if you've never set foot in your child's school, or talked to teachers or talked with your child about school, this might be helpful. But, if you've done any of the above, you aren't likely to learn much from this book. I was hoping to get some fresh insight into how to help my daughter, but there was nothing in it that 98 percent of concerned parents don't already know."
2,Movie ruined by stupidity of main characters,"This movie was extremely disappointing. How many horror movies have been ruined because the main characters make stupid decisions over and over? Although this film had tons of potential, I found myself spending most of its duration saying, ""Why are you doing that?"" or ""How can you be so dumb?"" The writing is lazy. Rather than the characters getting caught up in realistic conflicts, the horror continues only because they can't remember to hold on to a weapon, they hide in stupid places, or they trust those who they obviously should not trust. Skip this one; it will only make you mad."
5,Enjoyable and refreshing thriller,I viewed this movie on cable last night and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. A bit of a slow start that in turn becomes a nightmarish encounter in the heavily wooded British countryside with lots of surprises and gritty realism.Some surprisingly strong acting performances by a group of relative unknowns. A tense and agonizingly terrific ending. I recommend.
3,"from the producer of ""The Descent"", another winning thriller..","this film happens to have the same producer, music composer, and editor from ""The Descent"". I liked the overall look and feel of this film (just like ""The Descent""). The acting was good, believe-able, with good chemistry in the two leads.brief plot: A couple goes on a romantic vacation in a remote wooded area in Britain to get away from the stress of city life. Everything is going well, until they run into a pack of drug-crazed teenage hoods hellbent on terrifying them. Soon they are on the run for their lives, lost in the woods.the plot could have been a bit more inventive, but the acting is well done and compensates for this. The cinematography is well done as well."
5,LOVED THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was a pleasant surprise ... I don't usually like ""scary"" movies but I do LOVE disturbing movies like these... I have a little list of favorites and even got a few more recommendations on these reviews that I can't wait to check out!If you know of any other films like Eden Lake, The Strangers, Wolf Creek... please share them with me.. I would love to check them out!brandarooo@gmail.com"
3,No Garden of Eden Here!,"Eden Lake is pretty standard survival-against-the- odds fare, the only difference is that instead of the usual monster/alien/chainsaw wielding cannibal or hillbilly redneck is that this time our hapless victims are fleeing from a gang of bicycle mounted pubescent Brits lead by a kid who'd give the Malcolm McDowell character in CLOCKWORK ORANGE a run for his money. Tedious for me but if you're s fan of slasher flicks this film is going to send you into the throes of rapture because it is relentless in it's depiction of violence and degradation."
3,"Close, But No Cigar.","Eden Lake is a well made horror film for the most part, but fails miserably in it's conclusion. Setups in movies are easy. It's finding the resolution that's the hard part, and this is a good example of a film that suffers from the lack of any sort of meaningful ending. I'm not saying a film can't have a sad or dark ending, but it needs to have a conclusion of some sort. But other than that, this film is one of the better horror films of the last few years and is certainly worth a look if you are a fan of the genre."
1,Waste of film,"This was the most pointless, waste of film I've seen in a long time. You're probably thinking there is a lot worse but I'm good at filtering crap out. This slipped by. The violence and characters were single dimensional. The violence happened for violence sake. Whoever is responsible for this indulgence in stupidity and complete implausibility should find a new career. I'll watch for James Watkins like I watch for excrement on the sidewalk - step over and keep on going."
3,Way too many implausibilities,"She's in a huge forest. And yet, no matter what direction or how far she runs, these kids are always within ear shot of her. It just so happens the car that stops for her is one of the kids brother. When she takes off in the car, no matter how far she drives, she just happens to crash in front of the gang leaders house. Nothing is ever said about who was in the car she hits.They become non existent. For a movie like this to be satisfying,there has to be some kind of revenge factor. After all that happened too her and her boyfriend, she manages too kill one kid and immediately feels bad about it. She kills another one purely by accident.There were too many adults in the last scenes to believe what happens to the girl could be covered up. This movie was OK, but could have been a lot better."
2,Ridiculously Silly Nonsense,"Another stale, wooden performance by Fassbender. Tell me again why he's so popular. In the first 10 minutes it was clear to see there was nothing new or interesting here. Incredibly stupid scenarios. The violence is tough and gritty, but still falls flat because the acting is so lousy and scene after scene is just too lame to be even remotely believable. In other words, a typical horror story. The ""victims"" were annoying saps, and the pack of kids, while vicious, still lacked the credibility to be viewed as anything other than brainless. I wanted to like this, but it's tough to find a decent movie with all the required elements in this genre. After reading the positive reviews, all I can say is, ""What is wrong with you people anyway? There are movies head and shoulders above this. If you rave about garbage like this, you would never be able to handle movies like Martyrs, Inside, or Irreversible."""
1,The worst movie ever seen for long time...,"Do not waste your time for movie about humans with degenerate pathology. Short poor story about accidents and young humans crap. Cruelty, terror, torture and nothing more. I promise ignore James Watkins in future. Horrible ending...Useful for Michael Fassbender's fan's only but not for others.... The worst movie ever seen for long time..."
1,Numbingly Bad!!,"Terrible, just terrible. I like a good thriller, even some bloody ones but this one offers nothing. Threw it in the trash where it belongs."
2,UGGGGH!,I did not appreciate all the profanity. I had to put it on mute most of the movie. I hated the ending.
2,Stay Away From This Lake,"Eden Lake is another in the killer kids horror subgenre. I must not be a fan of this type of horror film because I didn't like Children of the Corn, and I don't like this one either. The pace is too slow and the ending is a real bummer, very unsatisfying. There are some good scenes toward the end, but not good enough to recommend Eden Lake."
3,Just ok,Worth a one time viewing but no additionals. Browse around a bit more before purchasing or renting this one. Take my advice.
3,Fairly decent thriller,This film is o.k. but really nothing to brag about. The rundown is the film is about a couple getting away in the woods for some R&R and things go awry by hoodlums. Some people might like it but I thought it lacked something.
5,great hitch,great hitch that fit the vehicle perfectly. The assembly aids that were provided were a big help. shipping was fast and the box was rugged. Overall a great transaction
1,Horrible Piece of Junk,"This thing was trouble the minute I got it. The surface is terribly rough and will scratch up your furniture. It's so difficult to squeeze in the hard drive. The covers are jammed force shut. The wires are way too short and pull apart easily. It also requires a 3 prong plug which may or may not be an issue for some people. And if you download their user manuals/guides/drivers from their site, the English is horrible... bad spelling, bad grammar. Obviously these people did not put much thought into this product in any way, shape, or form. Also, NewEgg.com displays that one good review about this product... what they don't tell you about is all the ones that they don't bother to post."
1,"""eBayTM Auctions, Buyers/Sellers Guide and More""Antiqs4u,Inc","This is a recitation of what you can find yourself on eBay, only this contains incorrect English. This booklet was published by the authors. The only helpful part was a several page discussion of what is selling well now in collectibles."
5,Great Book,I received the eBay guide today and read it from cover to cover. ITS ABSOLUTELY GREAT. I plan to begin selling items on eBay and it answered all my questions. You did a wonderful job of putting this guide together. Thanks Lynn
3,"It was ok, but not as good as the original movie","This tv show is a takeoff of the movie, but it is just a tv show and not especially good. Our daughter did not really get into it."
2,nothing special,"After reading amazon reviews of this CD I thought it was going to be something fresh, but it's not, it's the same old MOR that almost killed R&R; in the late 70s. To my ears, this CD is over-produced and overly anthemic. The tracks lack intimacy and warmth, both in the performance and in the recording.These guys don't really understand the blues, so don't buy this album if you're looking for good blues or blues rock. GM's resident guitarist plays OK but lacks passion and more than that he lacks his own style - he plays like a good studio guitarist. The two flashes of brilliance on this album are both provided by guest guitarists, Derek Trucks and John Scofield. I played this CD twice and found it so predictable it wasn't necessary to put on ever again ...I much prefer the Black Keys or Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for a fresh approach to white blues rock. It ain't a generation gap, either, as I'm older than the guys in Gov't Mule by a few years ..."
4,"The Deep End, Vol. 1 - song by song","Really enjoy this CD. If you can get the version with the bonus live disc, I say get that one. Not my favorite Mule album. That belongs to ""Life Before Insanity."" Still fun to listen to though.Rating (out of 10)Album as a whole - 7 (8, if you get the bonus disc)Fool's Moon - 6Life on the Outside - 8Banks of the Deep End - 10Down and Out in New York City - 9Effigy - 7Maybe I'm a Leo - 8Same Price - 7Soulshine - 6 (check bonus disc for an awesome Warren haynes solo acoustic version)Sco-Mule - 4 (didn't really get into this one)Worried Down With the Blues - 9 (Derek Trucks!)Beautifully Broken - 8Tear Me Down - 4Sin's a Good Man's Brother - 7"
5,A Must for Mule Fans,"This CD exhibits the musicianship and diversity of this powerful band. The superb musicians on this disc lead the listener down many roads, anticipating better things to come as the work progresses. Abts and Haynes provide tight, powerful, foundation to the varying styles of bassists and artists featured."
3,"Fun, but tiresome","I had envisioned the MULE's efforts on ""The Deep End"" to have more originality. I was wrong. Even though I enjoyed the disc I was disappointed that there wasn't any new ore mined."
1,terrible movie,Absolutely awful production values. Acting was dreadful all around. The writing was confusing. The editing was some of the worst I've ever seen. Save your money. One of the top 10 worst films I've ever seen.
5,Brava! Dear Lady,"This album is delightful and shows how versatile this grand singer is! The sound quality is very good and there is something for everyone: German Lieder to Cole Porter! One couldn't ask for a better ""light"" concert. It is pure pleasure.My only wish is that she had sung all the Lieder in the orginal language of German. At least one is sung in English."
5,This is really terrific!,"Aside from the understated; simply beautiful productions and the universal appeal of the songs, there is a certain sensibility in the writing that, to me, seems quintessentially NYC. So very touching: sensitivity and hope in the midst of ""real"" experience... Lovely."
3,Adequate,The Frommer's guide to Banff and Jasper had the expected information but somehow seemed less useful than Lonely Planet guides I have bought for other trips. I didn't like one of the places they recommended staying (Banff Caribou Lodge - nice on the outside but a tiny old guest room). It has hiking information but it just didn't seem very useful or in depth. I ended up relying on other tour guides picked up along the way to help pick out hikes.
1,This Made My Lame List,"I'm glad you took the time to make it to the bottom of this page to read my one star review. It looks like the company that produced this video got together a few friends to write positive reviews for this DVD. I'd really be surprised if you didn't agree with my one star assessment after seeing this miserable and amateur-looking video.This is without a doubt one of the cheesiest productions I have ever had the displeasure to view.As a 4th and 5th grade teacher, I rented this to show to my students to introduce science topics. The movie is nothing more than a PowerPoint show set to some of the most inane and awful music ever to persecute my ears.My students hated it as well. Here are some of their comments:""I can't understand what they are saying.""""They keep singing the same thing over and over.""""Can we do math now?""Don't waste your time on this, I guarantee you'll hate it too."
2,Bravado bras are better,"I agree with Rebecca -- Bravados are more simple, more flexible, and more comfortable."
1,Old,"We ordered this product and when it came it appeared old. More like something you would buy at the ""dollar store"" vs Amazon. My wife has trouble finding the product so did not want to return it. If it would have been my decision, it would be in the mail and returned. Whoever Amazon ordered this from should be off Amazon's list of approved distributors. Very disappointed!!!"
4,Good reference for Builders and Engineers,"What can I say?? It's the only book out there on metal-plate-connected wood trusses. Would be nice to have more information on permanent lateral bracing--this subject could use a lot more explanation--needs to be explained the way shear walls are in ""Wood-Framed Shear Wall Construction--an Illustrated Guide"" ([...]). This handbook covers trusses from testing, design and fabrication to MOST of the truss installation process. Another thing missing is how to handle the spreading of scissors-trusses so they don't push out the tops of your walls when they sag. Pretty comprehensive in what it tries to cover; experts in any one area presented may be disappointed at lack of depth in that area--but they'll probably learn something in another area. That's the trade-off when you try to cover everything in one book."
3,A Thread to Follow,"This is the first of the Needlecraft Mysteries that I've read. I enjoy doing needlework of different types and thought it might be a fun read. The plot was well woven, the characters were lovable people you want to get to know in the next book, and I found myself trying to figure out which kind of lace they'd found and who could be guilty. The book has several well thought out twists to keep you guessing, and as soon as I finished I passed it on to my mom and sisters who thought it was a good read as well. This is definitely a theme series though and if I hadn't been interested in this particular theme it might not have attracted me. It's a good clean mystery that will keep you guessing. I will be reading each of the books in this series."
5,Great cozy hobby mystery series!,"I have just discovered Monica Ferris and her crafting mystery series. As a crafter, I enjoy when it is part of my mystery reading also. I am making my way through book by book. I just chose one to review but so far this review covers the first five that I have read. The stories aren't predictable and I haven't noticed the type of template writing that so often happens in series like these. If you like needlecraft, knitting and murder mysteries, you have to give Ms. Ferris a shot."
1,THE TWO WORST MOVIES EVER!!!,Now you too can own the worst movies ever made! This two pack contains movies that should have never been made. I would highly recommend spending your hard earned money on anything else...
5,Lamont Live!,"""The blues movement has ranks of talented and accomplished performers. Most, however, are great imitators and not really innovators. A few, Robert Cray, Blues Traveler and Pat Hayes, leader of The Lamont Cranston Blues Band, are the ones who respect traditional artists but are not content to merely remind us of blues heritage. Pat Hayes is one of the select few who creates and innovates. His harmonica, guitar and vocals, although happily reminiscent of the finest Chicago-style players, have advanced the Cranston band to a distinct execution and style unlike any other heard in contemporary blues music. A premiere band of the American Midwest, no one infects venues with the party virus quite like Pat Hayes and The Lamont Cranston Blues Band. They've always been my favorite!"" - Elwood Blues (aka Dan Akroyd)"
5,Excellent CD!,"This CD really brings back the 'feel' of the TV show. It is great to put on as background while out and about in the car.I own Miami Vice I and II, while there are a few repeats most of it was new.If you are a MV fan then I strongly recommend it!"
5,If you LOVE the music on Miami Vice then you HAVE to own this!,I happen to really enjoy the show and the music of Miami Vice. This double CD captures a lot of the series music. I wish there was more to purchase but I will take what I can get. Very good buy.
5,The Missing Score Album,"This is the soundtrack album for ""Miami Vice"" that should have been released 15 years ago.It contains most of the music from Jan Hammer's defacto ""Miami Vice"" score, ""Escape from Television"" on disc 1, but the real treasure is on disc 2 - nearly all of the music there is previously unreleased in the US, and conveys the flavor of the quintessential 80's television series.You know the story by now, but the style of ""Miami Vice"" set the stage for action television and movies of today. Jump cuts, strong musical tracks, noir-driven sequences; all mainstays of contemporary shows like ""CSI"" and ""ER"" have ""Miami Vice"" to thank for setting the table.This set lets you feel the wind in your hair, hear the roar of the Ferrari motor and recall the question: ""How would you like a career in Southern law enforcement?"""
4,"Wonderful ""Window"" into the life of Abraham Lincoln","Even a casual student of American history can recite many of the salient points of the career of Abraham Lincoln as president. This book takes the reader far beneath the superficial surface information. While McClure was an eyewitness to many of the events described, he maintains an objective viewpoint. I enthusiastically recommend this book to any reader who desires a ""fly on the wall' perspective of Lincolns presidency."
2,"Good book, *bad* reprint","Charles Lobingier was one of the best Masonic historians to come out of the US. This particular work is not only rare and valuable, but it provides a very good look into a number of hard to find aspects of the Scottish Rite. The problem is that this particular re-print is a very poor photocopy reproduction with quite a number of pages so very faded that they can not be read. If you are a serious researcher, then this work (even reproduced in such a sub-standard manner) will be of value. If you are only looking for a nice read, then the quality of this reproduction will turn you off and leave you feeling cheated at spending the money."
5,Recommended guide to bird behavior,"I've owned this book a while and find and it to be an excellent source of information on individual species of birds. For some of us, just learning to recognize birds just isn't enough. Behavior is very interesting also, and this book contains interesting informative information on different birds. This is a must have for the library of every birder."
2,Received Mangled!,"It shipped in a box for its protection. Was it mangled before it was put in the box, I doubt it?"
1,Never Received Product!!!,"These items were purchased and never received, now that it has been more than 30 days.!!! Buyer beware!!"
5,one of the elite,I have read every one of Ms. Bennett's books and find her to be better than every other author in the fantasy realm except one. She knows how to capture the reader and keep them wanting more. These novels are easy to read and very exciting. I reccomend this author to any reader interested in fantasy books.
3,Personal Web Server,"I'm not completely through this book yet. I like the format and the step-by-step approach with lots of boxes for special notes and cautions. There are a few typos (as mentioned in previous reviews) but, in my opinion, they are minor and did not distract from the subject material.I am writing this reveiw now because: 1) the www.prima-tech.com site is not working and 2) I wanted to tell readers how to get past a difficulty that I had on page 84.You need to know the IP address of your PC in order to utilize Personal Web Server while testing your work. There may be other methods, but I did the following: 1) open a MS-DOS window and 2) type ""ipconfig"" at the c:\windows>"" prompt. You can then use this address within your browser (connected or not) to test your work. The author assumed that I already knew how to get and use my IP address. He should include a box on page 84 to explain how to do this for each operating system covered in the book."
1,I guess it's ok if you have *no* clue,"I won't expound on all the typo's already reviewed. I'm disappointed that there is no meat to the book. It is a book of ""click this button and you will get these results"" There seems to be nothing more here than in the included documentation. Lots of verbage too. I don't need 5 lines of text explaining why the author chose to use an underscore as part of the name of the folder he created, or a whole page dedicated to the installation status bar. I bought the book for more detail on a few different aspects of Homesite and got absolutely nothing out of it. I wasted my money."
2,"Informative, but poorly edited!","While this book made it simple to practice using HomeSite's features, I found many typographical errors throughout. One in particular appears on page 189, in the ""Caution"" sidebar. Instead of listing the title and author of another Prima Publishing book, the text reads, ""... be sure to check out TITLE HERE, by Author Name ..."" Ouch! Overuse of commas also is prevalent throughout this book. I purchased HomeSite 4.5 Fast & Easy Web Development because of its hands-on format. It's disappointing--and a poor reflection on Prima Publishing--that this book couldn't have been edited better."
4,Great - IF you like an extremely firm wrist rest,"I had high hopes for this wrist rest after having read reviews on a few sites, but was ultimately disappointed. If you like a VERY firm wrist rest, you'll love it, but I personally find it too hard, hence the four stars instead of five. It does provide relief from the hard edge of my desk, and it is the perfect height for today's flatter keyboards, but I prefer a softer wrist rest with more of a pillowy feel.PROS:InexpensiveGreat height for today's flatter keyboardsNice fabric covering (looks like it should wear well)Non-slip backing on the bottom works greatNot prone to leakage like many gel-filled alternativesGreat if you like very firm supportCONS:Too firm if you prefer more ""give"" or softness in a wrist rest"
3,Not Long Enough!,"I was a little disappointed with the product because I thought it was the same length as my keyboard. It is about an inch off and not very thick. I would have hoped for better wrist support, but it'll do. My previous one was long and stuffed with more padding for support. The price at Amazon is a lot better than the one I saw at the store. This made me feel a lot better instead."
4,"Nice, soft but stinky","It came in a relatively nice packaging... and does fit a standard size keyboard. The comfort level is what kept the score high. But it stinks of chemicals... and it does stick to your palms after using. Buy this if you wanna pull a subtle prank. Overall, a good product for its price range. :P"
1,horrible,Poorly made. Started to come unglued at seams after a couple weeks. Bits of foam falling off. Garbage. Waste of money.
4,Above Average,"It's not among the best of its genre, but this book is still above average and memorable. The action begins right away and the night beasts (pterosaur-like creatures) take over rather quickly. The book focuses on a group of people trying to survive a city already under siege. The length of the book exceeds most B-horror books out there, but it moves swiftly. I'm very glad this book made it to the digital format (ended up buying the paperback twice) and hope it rises in the ranks. It would make a good companion piece toRoadkill: A Novel of Horror."
3,Clarification,"Just want to clarify one point: although Thom Bell certainly made his mark in the music world with what he created in Philadelphia, the sessions for this release were recorded primarily in Seattle, at the old Kaye-Smith Studios (now Bad Animals studio, owned by the sisters from Heart and primarily famous for its film work these days). The early demos may have been done in Philly, but the last three tracks were done in Seattle. How/why? Thom's nephew Leroy Bell was working well in Seattle with his partner Casey James (they later created the disco hit ""Livin' It Up (Friday Night)""). The pair of them wrote the tunes Elton recorded. The Thom Bell tunes are part of the great 'lost' Elton tracks, along with the songs he did for the movie 'Friends'."
3,The greatest hit is what makes this CD 3 stars.,"As you might know, Mama Can't Buy You Love is the greatest hit (on greatest hits volume 3). It is what keeps this CD at the 3 star rating. If you had to pick between which 1979 Elton CD to purchase, A Single Man is much better."
4,Fusing Elton's pop with Philly soul works surprisingly well,"Sure, some of the songs drag on a bit long, but overall, i really like this album. It's funky without sacficing even a moment of melody. And it never, ever goes into the dreadful disco that Elton did in the late '70s (right before 21 at 33)."
1,Leave this album in the 22nd row,"A rather poor attempt on Elton's part to fuse his music style into the popular disco era. The album is admittedly quite a deviation from his standard works and the songs were rather disturbing to my melodic ear. Drink and drug diluted his work and creativity. The lyrics were not typical of Taupin's either. ""Do it nice and slow"", ""mama don't love you"", and others were quite repetitive and represented a lack of creativity. The album should be taken off the shelves and placed in the archives along with Cold Spring Harbor."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...""Shine on Through"" is the one decent song, but Elton and pop disco don't work well together."
2,"Great idea, bad execution","Here's what I don't like about this toy -1. The state boundaries are not the piece boundary. Meaning, you could have a black ""state boundary"" line running in the middle of a piece.2. Some pieces straddle 2 states or more.3. If your child accidentally touch a piece placed (which is common with a jigsaw), it will say the name of that state. Too sensitive; which renders the sound feature useless.I like most M&D; toys, but this one is really frustrating because the idea was great, the execution was horrible."
3,not as described -- says only state names and capitals,"I'm not hearing music, animals, vehicles, letters, numbers or more, as in the product description on this webpage, only the state names and capitals. On the manufacturer's website[...]they say: ""As each piece is placed correctly in the puzzle board, your child will...hear the names of the states and capitals!"" So the description on this amazon page is just wrong.We haven't had the puzzle long enough for me to comment on durability. Everything else seems fine so far, but I expected a much better toy."
4,Educational and fun,"This is a great educational puzzle. Of course, many of the Eastern states are combined. It also says the name of the state regardless if it is correct. But all in all, it's a clever puzzle and the sound adds the fun."
3,worst puzzle ever,"This puzzle would be much better if there was no sound at all (thankfully we have one of those too). My biggest complaint is that when you are putting the pieces back in, if any of those sensors get covered than it will just shout out that state, correct or not. My almost 3 year old gets so mad at this puzzle because she will put a state in that she knows and it will yell out something else and she will get frustrated because it's not saying the correct state. This is supposed to be a learning toy, but it's not teaching correctly when a kid can lay down Washington on, say, Georgia and the puzzle will say 'Georgia'. Pretty bad. So if you're looking for a puzzle like this, Melissa and Doug also makes one that does not speak, buy that one.Another minor thing is that most of the north eastern states are jumbled together. Like 2 or 3 states make one puzzle piece, which hardly serves the purpose here. But I do understand that those would be some itty bitty pieces."
2,Poorly cut pieces,"This puzzle was said to be an awesome educational item, but after ordering it, I found the puzzle pieces were not cut exactly how the state was leaving some of the boarder on another piece. Then 1/2 the puzzle failed to say the name of the state and the capital. It was over priced and poorly designed."
3,Great Puzzle,Great puzzle but all the states are not separate so it defeats the purpose of learning each state. But overall good sound and good for small children to learn where the states are located around the country.
3,Inaccurate state shapes- sound is annoying,"All these talking puzzles- animals, states, etc make noise when the space is covered up- even if it is the wrong piece. Some states like Oklahoma that have a panhandle have been combined with pieces of other states to increase durability. Unfortunately this is confusing to younger children who have memorized the state shapes."
1,Counter productive,"I thought the puzzle that gave states as well as their capitols would be great for my 5 year old daughter. I was VERY disappointed when I realized how the map worked. If you put ANY state over the ""Texas"" sensor the map identifies it as Texas and gives the state capitol as ""Austin"". No matter what state you place over any particular sensor, the map gives the state and capitol information related to the sensor...not the puzzle piece. My daughter propmtly held up South Dakota after putting it over the Minnesota sensor and proudly proclaimed South Dakota as Minnesota. I will have to turn off the voice portion of the map so my daughter does not get confused. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product."
2,a bit disappointed,"I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas. There are a handful of things I don't like about it. One, the pieces aren't necessarily shaped like the state. It's hard to explain, but each state is outlined on the board and then the actual piece isn't necessarily that exact shape. It's confusing to my daughter who normally does great with puzzles. Two, when you put a piece in place you hear the name of the state and the capital...which is great. But I was wish it only announced the state if it was the RIGHT piece. YOu can put Kansas in Colorado's spot and it will say ""colorado, denver"". Three, the pieces are breaking easily and my daughter isn't hard on things. Four, the sound is light sensitive...if every piece isn't in place and you turn the lights off or on, you start hearing all the states/capitals being announced. A bit annoying.At the very least I would go with a regular puzzle of the United States...skip the sound."
2,No ON/OFF switch,"The biggest problem I got is it doesn't have an on/off switch. So when you turn on/off your light, or even when there is a cloud passing by in the sky, it will start to talk. Think about it: you turned on/off the light in the middle of the night to get something, all the sudden you heard ""Alabama ..."", quite scary isn't it?"
2,M&D USA Puzzle Plus Sound,I would recommend not buying this puzzle. Just buy the regular USA puzzles. The cutting of the states on this puzzle are not even. Parts of states are cutoff on almost every piece. Some of the puzzle cuts include 2-5 extra states. In addition is the terrible sound functionality. Instead of having some simple button being depressed when you put the puzzle piece down it has some kind of sensor. There have been many times at night when I go by my son's toybox and the puzzle starts calling out state names just from the wind passing by it from me walking. :)
2,Talks in the night,"This puzzle will start rattling off states and capitals at all hours of the day or night. A draft, a slight light change, someone walks by, and it starts talking. Even with all of the pieces out. I've had to remove the batteries."
4,Almost great.,"I got this for my 5 year old twins for their birthday. Both boys are fans of puzzles and they have enjoyed playing with it. It appears to be sturdy. The only drawback is that its optical sensors are too sensitive and it says the name of states when your hand is just passing over a sensor on the way to put a piece in its spot. For example, when you are putting Texas in, it was ""Florida, capital, Tallahassee"" because your hand passes over Florida on the way to Texas. But, knowing this, I don't think it would deter me from buying it."
2,disappointment,"I usually love Melissa & Doug products, but this one is not what I expected. It doesn't always give the correct state and the combinations they used are odd. I donated it almost as quickly as it shipped."
5,Great product,kids love it have had a great time picking out where relatives live and places we have gone on vacation
5,wonderful learning tool,"As soon as I opened this puzzle and added batteries, my 3 year old son couldn't get enough. Within a couple of days, he learned where all the pieces fit and now if I ask him where a state is, he will point to it. This is a great learning tool for young minds. Highly recommend!"
5,Great Educational Toy,"Second one of these we bought, after we gave away the first to some other children. Nothing but good things to say about Melissa & Doug"
3,It's a bit small,"I just got this and I found the wrist pad to be a bit on the thick side, but I think I can get use to that. It is pretty comfortable. What bothers me most is the size of the mouse pad. It's about 6 inches by 6 inches. My hands aren't terribly big, but I do have long fingers and long, slender wrists. It seems that when I rest my wrist comfortably on the wrist pad, my mouse is positioned at the very top of the mouse pad, and I am always attempting to move it higher and I end up moving the mouse off the pad. If you have large hands this probably is not the mouse pad for you. If your hands are small, then it will probably be just fine."
1,Gel is HARD.,"I got this to replace the my current mouse pad, which is (supposedly) exactly the same model. I bought my old one back in early 1999, it is well used, has seen better days, but still has plenty of life left in it. My old one has soft gel that conforms to your wrist and flexes when you move your wrist. This one does not. It is very hard gel and has a lower profile than the older one. Technically, it does provide wrist support, but so can a brick. The mousing surface actually is softer, but that it a moot point, and it is thinner, which gives a lip at the edge of the pad. Actually, the pad is softer than the gel, pathetic. BTW, the old one was made in USA, this one is made in China. Sad, sad, sad replacement and I will be returning it.Oh, and to the reviewer that compared it to uncooked steak: close, but less rare, more well done and left on the counter over the weekend."
3,Fellowes gel mouse pad,"If you have own this model in the past and loved that one, you will probably be disappointed with this one. Gel Pad is harder and thinner than the original."
3,Color is true,This Fellowes Gel Mouse Rest and Pad is great because of its size. The wrist rest is stiffer than the original one I owned which was made in the USA. This version is now made in China.
4,Gel Mouse pad and wrist rest,"Other reviews of this item indicated the gel wrist pad was not as thick as previous version and they are correct. It is not, however still found it has sufficient elevation to provide the support needed, though admit I did like the previous thicker version a little better. It is in fact also a little stiffer gel as others noted, but still find it comfortable. Price was OK, but recommend bringing back the previous gel pad thickness. Pad size for the mouse is more than sufficient. If you find it is too small, you may consider calibrating your mouse to require less movement."
3,Rockford Files:The Kirkoff Case,James Woods did a great job in this show.He was very great in it.One of my favorite Rockford Files Shows.It's a good Action Show.
4,A must read book for any age,"This book is about a thirteen year old boy named Pierre who becomes a voyeger and spends two years in northern Wisconsin, Michigan, and Canada. He works for the North West Company with a good friends La Pettite, Beliot a sheer chatter box, louie a new comer to the company like Pierre was two years ago. They build a trading post in an indian village. Pierre expeirences many crazy and wild adventures wile with his crewmembers in the northern woods.This book is filled with courage trust and most of all friendship. A perfect book an adventure loving person who likes the outdoors."
2,An ok book...not that interesting,"Wintering is about Pierre, a thirthteen-year-old boy, boy spends the summer of 1800 paddling and portaging a canoe twenty-four hundred miles into the French Canadian wilderness. When He is fourteen-year-old he becomes an hivernant who traps and trades furs with a crew in the North. He had to spend months in closed quaters with a teasing bowman and his leader that trys to push pierre into reading in english. Pierre becomes really close friends with an Ojibwe, who welcomes Pierre La Page into the his family.If you like French and understand French, adventure, love the wild, and like Indians then Wintering is the book for you."
2,PC MumboJumbo,"I read, and used in a history class, this author's first book in this set so I ordered this one to add to my personal library. It is not worth the purchase due to the pc insertions that were hard to ignore."
4,Park Repair Kit -,The clamp on my Park stand had a stripped bolt and this kit was just what the doctor ordered. I essentially got a new clamp. I'm sorry I waited as long as I did. If the clamp on your Park stand isn't working well this is the ticket.
3,disapointing remixes,"The original version of the song is the best one on here. That should never be the case when there are remixes involved. The Dark Child remixes (done by Rodney Jerkins - who also produced the original version of the track) are alright, but they sound way to similar to the original to have any sort of impact. The Pablo Flores remixes are alright as well, with a house/salsa groove to them , not too bad for club consumption, although the vocals seem to be lost a bit behind all the beats. The bonus track - ""No Mes Ames"" - is a duet between Lopez & singer Marc Anthony. It didn't do anything for me, but it might for someone else. Also, I think that Lopez sounds like a lesser-talented Jody Watley."
5,If You Had My Love is a wicked song,"I don't have the CD but I heard the song on the radio, and after ti was over, I couldn't get the song out of my head."
3,Body Glove swim jersey is tight fit,I read all the reviews about these being sized small and bought an X-Large. My typical size is large. It is still too tight and I should have bought an XX-large. Not bad quality and appearance for the $19.95 price but the sizing thing has me puzzled. The product description should explain how the product is sized and what is the proper fit for this type of shirt.
2,"Too Short, Too Thin","I have owned a lot of rash guards over the years, for surfing, so I know what a rash guard should be. I think this feels way thinner than any I've ever bought. Worse, it is too short. I'm just over 6' tall and thin, I bought an x-large like I always do. It is just fine as far as tightness goes but it leaves bare skin between the top of the trunks and the bottom of the shirt. If I raise my arms it rides up to my navel and the bare gap jumps to 4 inches. It should have been made easily 4 inches longer at the waist. I don't know if a larger shirt would be longer, but it would certainly be too baggy. I have to return it."
5,Very nice rash guard,"Ordered this for a trip we were taking going scalloping, and knew my pale skin would be in the sun for 8-10 hours. I ordered one size larger than normal as the other reviews suggested, and it fit great. It worked as expected and was very comfortable to wear the entire day. I ordered one for my wife as well, and she had the same comments and rating for hers. At the end of the trip we thought it had gotten lost and we were pretty bummed and were actually going to re-order the same one to replace it, but luckily found it. I'd order another in a heartbeat."
3,rash guard shirt,"I bought a XX-Large. I'm 6'-2"" about 175 lbs. Its really tight, sleeves are shortish. It works, but I'd hate to recommend to someone who is indeed ""XX large.""'The color is nice and it drys fast. If you use it to snorkel it will move up your back and you get a nice sun burn. I have to be pulling it down constantly."
4,body glove long arm rash guard,"I am 160 lbs and this XL rash guard fitted me snugly. I usually wear medium or large t-shirt but other reviewers have recommended to upgrade up to 2 sizes larger than normal. I guess I could order a large size to try out, but this XL size just fits me fine. btw, I ordered my wife another rash guard from O'Neil and the material from my body-glove rash guard is definitely superior."
2,If you like showing your belly this one is for you!,This is short. Very short. You raise your hands and this thing is half way up your chest. I would recommend going 2 sizes up without a doubt.
4,Great Product for the price!,"Logos were worn beyond the advertised ""gently used"" and the neckline was very tight when pulling over my head.Price was great and I got good use of it and plan on further use for kayaking, etc. Great purchase for $5!"
4,Does the job,I would prefer it to dry faster but all in all it did what I bought it for and that was to wear it under a full dive suit.
2,"collar does not expand, head did not get through","I returned this thing, do not buy it if you have a decent size of head. Do not use amazon promotion credit to buy clothing. If you return the item that does not fix, you lose your credit."
3,Don't use in water,"Wouldn't recommend using this item in water, the suncream that I used on my face and hands discolored the neck and arms after using it in the water. May not be so bad if I hadn't selected the white version!"
5,Fantastic fiction!,"This is the second book from Bill Myers that I read and I had as much trouble putting down this book as I did with his first one (Blood of Heaven).The description and action in this one kept me interested all the way through...the ending of course spells sequel which I found in ""Fire of Heaven"". What I didn't know was that is would tie two almost unrelated stories together.Bill Myers, I hope you continue to write more adult fiction. The characters and plots are well put together."
4,good book,Good book but i like the first one more (Blood of heaven). Nothing out of the ordinary. I think i was expecting more of the end.
3,Compelling,"Although I take issue with the author not revealing that we have to ask Jesus to save us, He won't do it without our permission. I must admit that I ""read"" this on audio tape, so maybe that was left out. I would be careful who I loaned this to. It's really out there!"
5,This is a Great Book!,"If you are wondering about things to come, This book will get get your heart to going! It will make you think and pray for the two to come."
2,From a black womens point of view,"If your Black american or happen to have the same texture this is only a high price gel, doest the same thing the dollar store gel do...it DOES get hard and it DOES flake....it holds but....for 20 bucks....its not worth it."
5,Handy Tourist Book,I have visited Virginia City a lot of times. When I saw this book at the book store last month I thought it was just another book about ghosts. I was wrong. This is about the best book I ever read about Virginia Citys ghosts. There were lots of places I didnt even know had ghosts in them. I would recomend it to anyone.
2,Disappointed,Its is nothing what I expected and took forever to get to me. I had to write my thank you notes out on regular thank you cards.
4,Top Notch...,"... if you get excited about paper. Prints nicely, looks and feels like quality. Maybe a small notch above the store brands I've used in the past. Recommended!"
4,Great for printing photos on these cards,"I've used these note cards for several years and am very happy with how my photos look on them, when I remember to use the correct paper setting on my printer."
1,I agree product is too perforated,"The color is fine the quality is OK. One can create a beautiful card, only to find that it falls apart, as you try to fold it! I ended up using scotch tape to hold the card together. There are many other products that produce beautiful cards and fold very nicely. I would not purchase this again."
2,Too perforated!,"I'm not sure why nobody else said anything about how easily these cards come apart. Images do print great on this paper and it's of good quality, but unless I want my cards to fall apart this paper does not work for me. I am not satisfied with this product."
1,Wrong Item shipped,The title of this item is wrong. What they ship you is only 34-labels not the 1000-labels on the item description above stated. I am fighting with office depot to get my full refund.
4,Worth the read...,"I read this book up to the point of DL Moody's death. at that point the author starting analyzing Moody and his approach to evangelism,etc. I was not interested in that point.Easy read. Very thorough. Very Good."
4,Dorsette's work is well-researched and very readable,"Any time spent reading about the life and work of D.L. Moody is well worth it. Moody impacted his generation for Christ the way Billy Graham has impacted ours. Details of Moody's Spirit anointed ministry are well researched and clearly presented in this excellent work by Lyle Dorsette. If you want to see what God can do through a person who is totally committed to Him, buy this book and read it carefully. Then, put it in your Church library for others to enjoy!"
4,Well researched and well written history of D.L. Moody,"Well researched and well written history of D.L. Moody by Lyle Dorsett.. There were a few times I would have liked to know a little more - as in Moody's experience of being ""baptized in the Spirit"". Yet there were many details offered that seem to be information overkill for me. The book contains both historical accounts and lessons to be learned.""A Passion For Souls"" is clearly favorable toward Moody but does not shy away from the weaknesses in his life and poor decisions he made. The chronicled development of his character, ministry skills and walk with Christ are inspiring and encouraging.Calling D.L. Moody the Billy Graham of the 19th Century is a compliment to both. I believe it would be helpful for every follower of Christ (and particularly those serving in ministry) to learn something of the dynamic and prolific life and ministry of D.L. Moody. He was a man who expanded God's Kingdom and contributed greatly to Christ's church."
3,"Remarkable pop-ups, no story","This book was both a pleasure and a disappointment. There are only five scenes depicted -- the dwarves come to Bilbo's house, Bilbo riddles with Gollum, the spiders, Smaug in his lair, the Eagles' arrival at the last battle -- but they are magnificent.The artist, John Howe, did remarkable work, but he needed some support here. The only text is a few excerpted paragraphs. This book would get a child interested in pop-ups but not necessarily in The Hobbit."
5,Interesting,I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
4,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It wasn't the greatest literary feat, but a good easy read with enough twists, turns, plots, and characters to hold my attention."
5,Great Character Development,"Donn Taylor slowly develops his characters and I loved it. You get to know his characters and become comfortable with them. The villians are evil and after 9/11 we know these people do exist. His research on Columbia was extensive and I felt I was in Columbia and could feel the cold in the mountains at night. I was cheering for the hero and being a Vietnam veteran, I knew his choices were hard. Donn Taylor has a realistic, well planned plot and a great twist toward the end. Buy, read, and enyoy."
3,a good story line slow to develop,this is a difficult book for me to evaluate.I like the plot but it has been a liitle slow in progressing.I am not sure I am being fair to the book .I have not finished reading it yet but at the same time I will probably go back and try again when I have a void in books to read . It does have the potential to finish strong but several good authors have recently brought out new novels which I was anxious to read.At the 20 percent finished point I would rate it okay or average with the hope the later part of the novel is more interesting.
3,I was looking for more.,I was hoping the brushes would be thicker than they were. But the price was good and it certainly was long enough to get the job done.
1,This CD is Not Even Worthy of a 1 Star Rating!,"I couldn't agree more with Amazon reviewer, ""A Music Fan From Miami"". This is THE WORST dance album ever!!!! Absolutely awful! If there was a 0 star rating I would definitely give it that."
1,WOSRT CD I EVER BOUGHT!!!,I HATE THIS CD!! I BOUGHT IT THINKING IT WAS A DIFFERENT CD THEN COULDN'T RETURN IT. WHAT A WASTE.
5,The Whole Truth,"Sophisticated, exciting, sexy, funny, tragic, cosmic, compelling and altogether entertaining. This book has it all. Pathos, Ethos, Mythos and a helluva story.I don't think I've ever read a better book by a first time author.She makes you live the story along with her. You know the pain, share the laughs, feel the heat and tremble at the treachery as she spins her tale of magnificent scope and dimension.Everyone has looked up at the moon on occasion and wondered about that milky white orb and how it got there. Pru tells you in no uncertain terms!This Grey Dude is either one of the great characters of literature or a cosmic actor of immense proportions. But I don't want to give too much away. My advice is - read this treasure and read it again! It actually gets better each time!And you get a damn fine lesson in the art and science of Remote Viewing along the way!!"
5,"Open Source Game Programming : QT Games For KDE, PDAs, And Windows (Game...","This book, by Thompson Learning, is an excellent book in that it not only goes into the code aspect of game creation using QT and a C++ compiler, but gives some insight into what it takes to design a particular game program solution.However, even though it does not take a whole lot of programming experience to program a game, one does need to have at least a working knowledge of form creation using (QT or a Visual program language) and some knowledge of a C++ compiler.Remember, to show a form it must be called by code which includes at least one (Show form) code block.I would say the programming level needed to use this book effectively is at least advanced beginning. And I believe some experience in the Linux version of QT and the Linux GNU C++ compliler would be very helpful."
4,culture novel,"I have read some of Banks fiction. I like his tempo and style of characterization.He has an interesting wit and great story telling skills. His stories are imaginative, with nice character building. I would rate his Science Fiction equal to the Peter Hamilton series. Banks as opposed to Hamilton, has less of a opera approach as the stories have new players and direction. I have Consider Phlebas, Use of Weapons, and Matter at my table and will rate these. I have read Excession and liked it as well."
5,Player of Games,"I would not have thought that a book about a guy who plays games could be so intoxicating but, that's just how I felt while I was reading it. The story has a lot in common with what is going on with humankind on many levels (a bit to close to home). The story struck me more as reality disguised as Sci-Fi, I found it both ugly and beautiful at the same time. Of course I still feel a little intoxicated (as you maybe able to tell from this review) with no signs of becoming sober anytime soon.Iain M. Banks is by far one of the best Sci-Fi writers, that I have come across. I highly recommend him to everyone."
5,My favorite book so far...,"This story smokes. It has a sizzling pace, strong character development, a great story and Mr. Banks anonymous storyteller style. Unlike Michael Crichton stories Mr. Banks actually manages to leave me feeling satiated when the story ends. I still have the copy I purchased back in 1989 when I was going to school in Manchester. Of all the books I have bought for the cover that were trash, this one has proven that the risk is worth it. I just wish I could find a hard cover first edition, so I wouldn't mind so much lending out my paperback."
4,"Good, not great","After reading ""The Wasp Factory"" I was eager to get my hands on another Banks book. I had tremendously high expectations, because I think TWF was brilliant; unfortunately, Player of Games did not fulfill them. It's a good book, but not a great one. It definitely has that ""golden age of fantastic SF"" flavor to it, which is not a bad thing at all, but I found it predictable, and was disappointed that Banks hadn't aimed a little bit higher. For me, Gene Wolfe is still the literary pinnacle of SF, but I haven't given up on Banks yet---there is too much praise for and promise in this man's work to do that, so I'll definitely be looking at the other Culture books. My recommendation is, if you want to read a good SF yarn, pick Player up; if you want something more cerebral, look elsewhere."
4,Imaginative and Intellectually Stimulating,"""The Player of Games,"" while mainly taking place outside of the Culture itself is, in some ways, at the heart of the Culture novels. It's about how the Culture thinks from the inside out, and about how the Culture differs from other, more Imperial, systems.Gurgeh is a master of all games, and when he is coerced into playing the most complex game ever devised, versus the Empire's players who've literally grown up with the game, he is unable to resist the challenge. It's an interesting premise, and the more you learn, the more you learn that it is more of life simulation than a game. All of this, unfortunately, makes the final act of the story a bit less than unpredictable, yet as in any Banks story, his intellect shines through his writing.Iain Banks dazzles the reader with ideas throughout the story and that's more than enough to make me recommend this novel."
3,Enjoyable But Thin,I enjoyed reading this. But it's really just a short story padded out to novel length. It could easily be cut to one third of it's length and sold in an anthology with two other novellas.There is one main character and the entire story follows this one character in a very linear fashion. It's certainly well-written and consistently interesting but not nearly as thought provoking as it would like to be. Player of Games could have been truly great if given a more complex and layered story with the added perspective of some other characters.
4,"Occasionally gripping, slight letdown at the end","Hadn't read Banks before, and read (here on amazon) that this was a good place to start. I enjoyed the book, and will read more of Banks' work (I have Use of Weapons queued up). A few quick points:+ Well-written, clear prose+ Solid, interesting ""world building""+ Good pacing+ Didn't tip his hand too soon, which kept the pages turning= Pretty dumb/annoying ""sci fi"" names= Would have liked more detail/texture on the game itself- Rushed and incomplete climax and denouement- Underdeveloped view of the antagonists- Weak characterization; never felt much empathy or distinctness of voices"
4,Culture Warrior,"I've read several of Bank's novels and I enjoyed 'The Player of Games'. The verb, enjoy, is subjective, and those who enjoy intergalactic warfare replete with android battles and exotic weaponry, may not be satisfied by this work. However, intergalactic warfare, android battles and exotic weaponry are to be found in every chapter here, albeit with superb exposition employing subtlty and guile. The protagonist is personified by the title and Bank's literary creation, The Culture, employs his considerable talent to its own ends. Grand imagery, irony and suspense comprise 'The Player of Games'."
4,very different from the last book,"When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I would like it very much since it seemed so implausible, but as it went on, I got to liking it more and more. It is very different from Consider Phlebas, the previous book in the series. The author does a fantastic job of making the alien game of Azad believable and exciting, even though we don't really ever learn the rules. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
4,It converted me to Sci fi,"I've read most of the Iain Banks books, but this was my 1st Iain M Banks.Its a great book,but I found it hard to follow in places. But as an intro to sci fi I really enjoyed it and have become an enthusiast."
5,My favorite Banks novel,"Bitter, twisted, peverse and superb. I've read everything Banks has written, both with and without the middle initial (the ""M"" labels his science-fiction books), and this is my favorite. All the M books are really good except ""Feersum Enjinn"" and ""State of the Art"". Banks is bravely experimental enough that not all his books hit the mark. This one does."
3,Huge fan....but glad when this game finished,"I have read most of Ian Banks' books but have struggled with how his style translates to science fiction writing under Ian M Banks. Recently I realized I had never read Espedair Street - well, I could not put that book down- I loved it and it rekindled how much I thoroughly enjoyed reading Iain Banks work. So I sought out a Banks' kindle book and chose Player of Games. Maybe it was because I didn't have any prior knowledge of the 'Culture' series but for me the story never quite clicked. So many of the threads I wanted to go somewhere seemed to fade and - for me - they never quite came back together the way most of his stories do. I did as usual love his writing style and the interplay between characters. I enjoyed the journey into mysterious places and the pace of the book, however if I have to be honest I was actually relieved when it was finished so I could start something new."
2,A slightly bored game,"The central premise of this novel; that a game plays an integral part in the running of an entire culture, is an interesting one. Banks is good at ideas but doesn't always manage to flesh them out in a convincing way. THE PLAYER OF GAMES is a case in point. It lacks notable characters and is thinly plotted. The sparse story is stretched by irrelevant excursions, and the denouement is an anticlimax. There's really only enough material here for a long short story, and I think that format would've done the idea more justice. I loved Banks's first handful of mainstream novels but I've struggled with his work since the mid-90s and have always struggled to like his SF. Sadly this hasn't changed things."
3,"Not the best, sorry.","Maybe I need to read this again, but it seemed kind of formulaic to me.Or maybe not formulaic. Maybe just after a certain period of time you simply expected the player's victory to be inevitable, and it was all yawns thereafter.Sure, it gets a little tense towards the end, but a large Greek Chorus of Dei ex Machina(e) handle the loose ends.It was one of those OK books to read. Certainly not at all in the same league as ""Use of Weapons,"" or jeez! ""Matter."" Now, *that*'s quite the book."
1,Not amongst his best efforts.,"Normally Banks presents a plethora of new ideas and interesting characters. Aside from his typical sarcastic robot, there is not much of interest here. It is quite obvious where everything is going from the moment Gurgeh reaches Azad we realize this will be the rehash of old tropes--the ""good"" gambler who needs to defeat the evil ones despite tremendous odds, and a blunter version of an old Star Trek episode, the ""aliens"" display a more extreme version of the faults of Western society. (And, of course, the good Culture agent needs to save them from themselves, much as Star Trek crew members had to in the old show.) Both of his main themes have been done often, and done better, by other authors."
3,a short story made long,"better say a good short story made too long.the main idea of the book is very good: someone is playing games for his living, and he encounters a game which is life itself.but most of the book describes in length this someone playing a game which you can't actually understand. and that is getting real boring after a while."
2,Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader,"A good Culture novel. The protagonist is a chess master on steroids, basically. An expert at all sorts of games, and what he does for money.A bunch of those sneaky Culture AI types recruit him to take part in a game that enthralls a whole planet a long way away, as part of what is basically a political and espionage plot, as said planet's rulers are not nice people, to put it mildly.The artifical companions are again wonderfully snarky (think K.I.T.T., that sort of thing, if you need a tv reference, or occasionally, O.R.A.C.)"
1,couldn't finish it,"This novel could have used an editor. Extremely slow and predictable -- I usually finish any book I start reading, but completely lost interest in this one about two thirds of the way through."
3,Three stars for the effort,"Rather than try to explain why I give the stars only for effort I will recommend two books. Since Amazon, in their incredible wisdom, ruined the review sites by removing the customer's recommendation box, this is the only way I have to ""review"" many of the books now. Reading the following books will clearly explain the problem of the Trinity of the Classical Theists:1. ""How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God""2. ""The Father Is Not the Son"""
3,Heads up.,"The official Amazon review does not mention that the author is a Jehovah's Witness. In light of the material being covered that is a significant omission from the review. Additionally, the author is trained as an engineer and has no advanced degrees in theology, philosophy or seminary."
1,Flippant treatment of a complex subject,"This book takes a very literal interpretation of scriptures, then lists all of the ones for and all the ones against and tallies them like a sporting event. The discussion on most scriptures is very brief, followed by a flippant comment. I had expected a thorough, in depth discussion of a complex doctrine, but unfortunately, this is not the book for that. The discussions on problems with translation are very interesting, but most other discussions were too brief, and even condescending. This book didn't convince me one way or the other, it just left me feeling like there was more to the story-- if it is as simple as the author presents it, that means millions of people are ignorant fools."
1,crap cable,this thing is junk tons of ghosting and double images..I installed my old standerd cable and everything was fine...Big waste of money!
1,belkin absolute garbage cable,I bought the 10 ft version of this cable.Used with a PC and Samsung TFT monitor.I can confirm that it gives bad ghosting.What a piece of junk.Replaced it with a another make and now havesuperb image quality.Avoid this type of cable at all costs !
5,cave paintings of baja:discovering the great murals of an unkown people,"If you were to buy just one book about the cave paintings in Baja,this is it.Wonderful stories blended with beautiful pictures,and fully acknowledges the indispensable part that the local guides played in the success of the expeditions.I had just returned from a trip into the San Fransisco Mountains with some of the descendants of the guides mentioned in this book,and was looking for more information on the people,the places,and the paintings,and this book does just that.Makes me want to go back and do more trips."
5,excellent practice along with book,I took 1 nei kung workshop class with ck chiu and found it to be excellent. I have several years experience with chi kung and found nei kung to be more intense and of more benefit...any negative reviews dont know what they are talking about...
4,prog gem,"for fans of the roger dean covers, this onestands out. awesome in album form.this was an original group, with a heavy keyboardsound, and outstanding drums.highlights are, sundance, feathered friends, and melange"
5,Not Your Average Romance,"As an avid reader of romance novels, I really loved this book!!!! It possesses a unique voice which also speaks to readers who enjoy a twist of hype humor found in chic-lit, while not following the same storyline you typically find. Josephine's quirky vulnerability is something any woman in love can relate to. Definitely a good read for summer trips. Bravo to this new author!!! I can't wait for her next book."
2,Old and brittle,"The plastic cords holding the caps together were broken, half of the bundles of caps were separated and loose in the box. There was a dated sticker inside the box, showed 2009 !! The caps dont load into the gun if they are not held together by the cord, so I only got half a box of usable product."
4,Very good,Received the product very promptly and it was in great shape. Personally I didn't like the CD as much as I thought I would but that's me.
1,"the unit arrive burn out, even before first use","I had just get 2 Hard Drive Enclosure one for HD 3.5"" that work just fine, and onther one for HD 2.5"" that din't work at allwhen I was going to plug my HD i had notice that the internal conection of the USB port was burn out, so i suppose come DOA (death on arrivable), I wonder if they just sell a me refurbish unitI am not going to reclaim for warranty becouse I am outsite de US, so send it back, will be more expensive that geting a new one"
2,Be careful before you order this,"Be sure to check your hard drive to make sure it is the correct type of 2.5 inch hard drive. My drive turned out to be a SATA drive, which does not fit this product. Since the shipping to return the item costs almost as much as the item, you are stuck with it if you order the wrong one!"
4,Cheap and works great!,"I liked this product a lot. It did what I needed it to do. I was able to get all my files from my old laptop and move it to the new laptop. This product only cost me about $10 at the time which is much less than other and it did just fine. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I used it only a couple of times for transferring files. I don't know how it will hold up as a back up drive that is being used regularly. Anyways, it was well worth what I paid for it."
1,Doesn't work with Win 7,"I guess you get what you pay for, but I didn't even get that. It didn't work with Win 7 as described."
5,works out of the box,works great with any 2.5 inch old HDD (non SATA). you may be required to laptop drive out of the case by unscrewing to expose the pins.
5,Worked great for me,"My old Acer workhorse laptop experienced an irreversible operating system failure that prevented it from rebooting. Although I had a backup to an external hard drive, there were several files that had not been backed up, so I needed to get the data off the hard drive before reinstalling the operating system. Luckily, I had an older hard drive with a functional copy of the hard drive installed, so I switched out the drive and then used the Sabrent to turn the current drive into an external USB hard disk to copy the files onto another external drive and then copied them onto the older drive I had as a spare. After that, it was just a matter of switching the drives again, reinstalling the operating system and then copying the full set of files back onto the drive from the Sabrent after reinstalling the software and I'm back up running again. This was a low-cost, efficient way for me to retrieve my most current information."
5,Saved my mom...AWESOME,"My mom has using my very first laptop, and even though it has been on its death bed for the past few year or so, it kept working as long as it was plugged. In the middle of writing her term paper (20+ pgs in) the laptop died. The battery went kaput. No matter how many plugs and chargers I tried it would not cut back on. I started searching for a IDE 2.5 casing, which is kinda hard to find. Anyway found this one-reviews were mixed took a shot and it worked. Has been working ever since"
1,Read the Reviews,"I should have read - or paid attention to - the negative reviews.It didnt work, quite simply. Product says it is Win 7 compatible - The device was unrecognizable by three Win 7 machines (2 of which were 64bit, 1 was 32bit). I've spent hours attempting to troubleshoot, but to no avail.I am giving it one more shot on an old 32bit XP machine. Even if it works, would not affect my rating, as it was advertised to be Win 7 compatible."
4,Works for me!,"I had a SimpleTech drive that I thought went bad. When I could hear the drive spin up yet received a faulty USB connection error message on several computers I connected it to, I cracked open the housing and took out the drive.I found it was PATA and I searched online for a cheap replacement. I found this model and ordered it. It's extremely compact. Don't expect any shock absorption from the housing but it worked great with the 2.5 PATA drive and I was able to get back at my data.I've only used it 3 times for 15 minute use since I got it. I cannot attest to it's functional longevity. It's perfect for laptop travel and large USB transfer use. I don't recommend this model for an always on external housing."
4,Standard USB Hook ups,This product is great but it has standard USB hookups. That is a prblem for someone who uses a laptop and has a lot of mini USB devices to switch around.
4,Important: uses two USB ports,"One thing that I don't see mentioned prominently concerning this enclosure: because a single USB port can't reliably offer enough power to run a hard disk, this enclosure comes with a special Y cable. You plug the end with two USB connectors into your computer, so that it draws power from two ports, and plug the single end into the drive. There is no provision for external power, as there is on some other small enclosures. Other than that quirk, the drive seems to work well enough with Mac OS X 10.6."
5,"Old Hard Drive, New Purpose","Problem: Old laptop is old. and has old laptop problems. Will be dead soon.However: The hard drive is not as old as the rest of it. Shouldn't throw it out too.Solution: Salvage hard drive from dying laptop, have extra storage handy.This thing works so well with my salvaged drive I haven't had to use the secondary USB for more power.Plans for it include making it into a Linux box which can run on just about anything and play emulators on it......win"
5,Exactly what I needed,"This product was cheap but did exactly what I needed. I would not carry my hard drive around in this but it does let me access and use the drive with no problems. After reading reviews, I was afraid it would be slow but it was very fast! I was surprised at how quickly I was able to transfer everything. For those nervous about being able to 'make it work', have no fear. It is fantastically simply. I used this product for an ATA drive."
1,Piece of junk!,"I purchased this unit in order to reuse three 2.5 inch hard drives that I removed from some old laptops that I recently donated...as an aside, I have been in the IT industry for over 10 yrs so I consider myself to be technically savvy. I installed the drive per the manufacturer's instructions, however when I attempted to connect the drive into my WinXP system, my PC recognized that I had inserted a USB hard drive, but the drive never got assigned a drive letter and did not show up through Windows explorer. I also had the same experience plugging this unit into my Win2k laptop and my Win2k3 server. I am VERY disappointed and perhaps I got a bad unit, but I will NEVER purchase anything else from this manufacturer again, and will only stick with a more recognizable name brand."
5,Pocket-Sized Data,"Exactly what I needed.Fits right in a purse or a back pocket.Easy to use, easy to assemble."
4,"affordable, and high quality case for laptop harddrives","The product got to my house very quickly within about a week of ordering.The case comes with a black metal enclosure which probably can get scratched and the paint will come off, but who cares? a metal cap which houses the chip, the light and the usb connection. a usb cable that has an option to plug-in 2 adapters so that the hard drive can get extra power and go faster.as far as I can tell this is a very solid piece of equipment and seems to funtion as it should."
4,Good for data recovery,"I bought just so I could pull the data off of a notebook that was damaged and it served the purpose. However, the case is too small too fit the hard drive inside. Fortunately, it is fairly easy to pry the case off from the hard drive connection so I was able to use it without the case.As a side note, the package includes a perfect-sized mini-screwdriver for opening up laptops. My old one was a bit too small and it was hard to get enough leverage to unscrew sometimes, but the one included in here worked wonders where I thought the screws would never budge."
4,Easy and cheap,"This is the second HD enclosure I bought to resurrect my wife's old Dell laptop's HD. I made a mistake on the first one and got a SATA, when I needed a PATA. My error. I was careful to order a PATA one this time, so you can imagine my irritation when the box it's packaged in labeled it as SATA. I almost sent it back without opening it. Nonetheless, it is PATA, and works great. It showed up right away on my wife's new Lenovo laptop running Windows7.It is a little loose inside, but if that really bothered me I could shim it with a piece of styrofoam or a wad of paper. Since it's just going to be an occasional backup HD, that doesn't matter to me. The screws do not really screw in that well, but that does not seem to hamper its overall performance."
4,Very good for the price,"I bought this to facilitate replacing a hard drive in an older model notebook using Arconis True Image. I didn't need a high quality enclosure, just one that would get the job done while transfer files from my old hard drive to the new one. This enclosure worked perfectly for my purposes and now serves as a back up drive for the computer.Pros:1) Price is right2) A very nice looking enclosure3) Good transfer speeds over USB 2.0Cons:1) Not impressive in build quality. The tiny screws used to secure the drive closed are pretty poor.2) Requires two USB connectors to function properly. If your laptop doesn't have two USB connectors right next to each other, this could prevent you from using the drive at all.Conclusions:This is a very inexpensive enclosure that is ideal if you plan on giving it light use. If you need a high quality enclosure, you might want to choose a different one."
4,Works well but be careful when plugging in drive,"Check that the drive is not attached to the IDE connector upside down, since there is nothing that indicates which way is up until you attempt to slide on the enclosure. The enclosure won't fit if the drive has been plugged into the connector upside down.If you test a drive without using the enclosure, as I did, and cannot read the disk, then the drive may be upside down (or set to be a slave, or a master with slave, or the drive or connector might be defective).First check that the enclosure will slide on as designed. If it does slide on at least you know that it's connected correctly and you've got other problems.Other than that, the unit is sturdy and once you get the tiny screws in the holes it is easy to assemble. I wouldn't recommend dropping a screw on a shag rug though."
3,Functional but not durable,I'm here buying my second Sabrent Slim... so obviously I've had a pleasant experience with the drive... however with that being said.. it has worn out after a little less than 6 months (the cord came apart at the end and broke apart). I do use it very frequently. For $7 though I'm sure you cant expect too much more.
5,worked great,I bought this to cloneIDE HDD to IDE SSD. It arrived fast and I was impressed with the quality of the product. I did not need instructions or the disk as it was straight forward plug and slide into the enclosure. My old Dell 8200 recognized the usb and the clone was easy. I then switched the drives and I used the enclosure as a second external drive. Perfect for the price.
5,USB Enclosure Good Buy,"This was exactly the right size for shirt pocket backup. Just add old 2.5 drive. Bus powered is great. Best way to make good use of those old notebook drives. Liked it so much bought 2 of these and 2 5.25 version.No frills, quality product."
4,"Simple, Straight forward, cost effective and easy to use",I brought this to restore data from my dying laptop. This product was so handy and easy to use I was able to make it operation and start pulling out the data in no time.I would recommend this product.- Praveen
1,will not buy it again,"i had it working only for one week, they it stopped working and i did not even tried to fix it. just bought a new one from a different brand."
1,Bad product,"I bought this product for my laptop hard drive and it wouldn't recognize it when i plugged it in to the computer. This product and other products from this maker are not worth the money, it would be better in the long run to just spend an extra 10 dollars."
3,works okay,"The document is not very clear. The cable that comes with it has a Y-split. On my computer, only one side of the Y works. When the other side is plugged in, the drive's green light comes on, but the computer does not detect the drive's existence. I simply don't know how to use the cable, which ends goes to the computer and which end goes to drive? Is the Y-split for a second drive?The plastic parts break easily, now I cannot sesure my disk drive inside this enclosure after a small tab broke off. Though it still works, it is not robust when carrying it around."
3,Case is to slim for the drive,"The case is too small for my old laptop hard drive. I guess it would fit is I took the cover to the hard drive off. Not sure if that would work though.... The connector and electronics work great after downloading a driver to my computer. without the case, it won't last for long...Don't buy this one...buy a bigger case...one with square corners would work fine...this one has round corners which cause the problem."
2,Just be warned,"I ordered this enclosure for my old Toshiba's 8GB HD. The enclosure is to slim for the drive. The Toshiba is about 7 years old. Just be warned since no dimensions are given for the enclosure.Also, I've ordered from Tigerdirect for many years, their shipping and handling cost me almost as much as the enclosure."
1,"Didn't fit, documentation unreadable","I don't know why, but the hard drive from my girlfriend's old Toshiba Satellite laptop couldn't quite fit into this enclosure. Perhaps because the laptop was so old, the drives were slightly larger than the current standard? So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the fit issue, because obviously it fit for many people. But the documentation is horrible -- practially unintelligible. A poor attempt at translation from... Chinese, perhaps? If you're tech savvy and don't need the instructions, great, but if you're not, you're out of luck. The purpose of the mystifying split USB cable is left unexplained, and there are no instructions for identifying what files need to be extracted from the enclosed CD. Not a good choice for me."
5,Great,Very good product. I used this same model at work before so I knew what I was buying. Very good product.
5,Easy to use,"The hard drive on my old laptop died, and would no longer boot windows XP. I replaced the hard drive in the computer, but wanted to see if there was some way to get documents and other files off the *hopefully* non-corrupted sectors of the old hard drive. As it turns out, the motor or actuator died, so my files were gone, but now I have this nifty enclosure to help out someone in need if the opportunity arises. And, it didn't set me back much, so this was definitely worth few bucks I spent on it to see if my old hard drive had any chance.Oh, and I originally plugged this into a newer windows 7 machine, and it was plug-and-play. Recognized the hardware almost immediately and worked as advertised as far as I could tell."
3,Awesome product for your old hard drives,"I just got this in the mail from Tiger Direct, and for the $$ it is definitely worth it. I have a few old hard drives that still work but my laptops no longer do and needed some external space. I looked at some external hard drives but decided to save the $ and go this route. I hooked it up to my laptop and was up and running in a minute, all of my files that were on my old HD's are easily accessible for review or transfer. If anyone has old drives that they can't access get this product it works great!!!"
4,Works Like a Charm,"had recently purchased a used laptop but only came with a 40gb hard drive so i bought a new 120gb hard drive, unfortunately my laptop only had one hard drive port. So i figured hey this is a cheap hard drive enclosure shoot ill give it a try. WORKS WONDER i was able to clone my hard drive with this with easy did exactly what i wanted with no problems. I dont care what other people say on this but this is an amazing product i would so buy one and recommend one. so if you need to clone a hard drive or just use it as an external one it works great A++ product"
3,I like it but...,"I bought this hoping to be able to get into an old laptop hard drive of mine. When I plug it in the hard drive does spin but, I have Windows 7 and this is supposed to be compatible but it will not recognize the device and it will not allow me to install the small disc it came with because I am running Windows 7 and it is supposed to automatically do everything once plugged in. Overall this would have been a great buy if it would just recognize the drive, so this did not work well for me but maybe someone else with an older OS (I think XP or Vista?)."
1,Camera auxillary lens set,"Very poor quality pictures when using these lenses -- just crop pictures in Photoshop to get desired ""zoom"" effect -- much higher quality results. Vendor was difficult for me to deal with. Called them, they instructed me on how to return lens set...I did as instructed, the package was re-shipped to me without comment...never did get a refund since could not get them on phone after the shipment was returned to me."
4,Understandng 1NT Forcing,It is very easy to understand with good examples. If you want to larn the 2/1 bidding convention this is a great help.
4,no more fights over 1NT,this publication covers most 1nt situations. highly useful to agree with partner and avoiding arguments!
2,Some Good Eats and Some Bad Eats,"I purchased this book when I first moved to Seattle. Some of the recommendations are okay, but some of them are really bad. I tried several of the suggestions, but after living here for a while I realized there were much better options that weren't listed in the book. I would use UrbanSpoon instead."
2,Depressing,"I guess I wasn't expecting it to be so depressing. The acting was fine, but it was too slow for me."
3,Not as good as Blind Fire!!!,"Sorry,but I found this CD a little over rated. With comparisons to Stride!??PLEASE Stride runs circles around this band in every way possible!But this is not a burn review,It's just build up was to much for me.The band is talented and has promise, as the second CD shows.The vocals are a bit bogged down,but the melody sinks in after time.The music is tight and well done.This is AOR/prog-metal. p.s.I think Seven Tears debut CD 'In every frozen tear' is worth the hype even though the production is weaker,or try Seventh Wonder-Waiting in the Wings for some jaw droping AOR/metal."
5,<3 Care Bears <3,"I must confess! I have a guilty pleasure! I have a complete obsession with the Care Bears! I absolutely love them! I adored them in the 80's! I would never miss an episode of the cartoons! Now, at 21 years old, I find myself running to Toys R Us every chance I get, just to purchase more items to add to my Care Bears collection! I have a little sister who is five years old and I am so thrilled to share the love of Care Bears with her! We watch all the movies that I have bought and read all the books! We divide up our collection so that at night time half of the bears would sleep in her bed and the rest in my bed; we alternate bears on a daily basis, ... It might sound silly, but hey, some people have worse habits than this. My sister and I just love playing with them, hugging them, and snuggling with them! I just can't resist them, especially Share Bear, she is my absolute favorite! Cheer Bear, is my little sister's number one Care Bear!"
1,Incorrectly comes up with Linksys KVM Switches,"Although these cables may work in some circumstances they do not belong with PS2 KVM switches, There is only one PS2 Cable included and it comes with a Din 5 and a Sub 9 (serial) connector. Carefull if you have a straight PS2 KVM Switch going to a PS2 Computer."
4,"This is a cascade cable, not computer to KVM.",I think the description should make it clearer that this cable is supposed to connect 2 KVM switches (to act as a larger switch) rather than to connect a CPU to a KVM switch.
2,Not what I expected,Didn't read the description completely. Thought this was a diecast and not a model. Haven't thought about putting it together yet.
5,Learning along the way,"Sometimes during the busy week it is just enjoyable to sit down with a good book and enjoy a good laugh. Fortunately for each of us, Ben has provided such a book. And on top of that, I learned a few things about management along the way. Nice going, Ben.Buck Buchannan Corporate Vice President EDS Troy, MI"
4,Random thoughts.....wandering minds...,I have just finished this book and I learned so much! It is definitely one I will review time and again. Gill makes learning life's lessons fun! His insight is invaluable and thought-provoking. I whole-heartedly recommend this book!
3,weak background,This book does not contain much cottage background material. I was expecting some photographic history from England...none to be found. Many pictures from subdivisions in the US. A cottage is not just what looks cute.
2,Book Review,"I purchased this book to read as part of a book club. The book is a compilation of ""horror"" stories. I say ""horror"" because the stories are not at all scary. Some of the stories are written in old English-type style which makes it hard to follow. Some are quite suspenseful and build you up only to let you down with no monster or demon or murder to follow. I am trying to get through the book but it is tough because none of the stories are holding my attention."
5,Great Magazine!,"This magazine is a must-have for Westchester residents. It has so many well written articles that are interesting, educational, and entertaining!"
3,"OK, and not OK","Long ago I posessed a record with Accardo playing Viotti Nr.22 accompanied by Elio Boncompagni, I still can remember it, it was beautiful, and it was my first encounter with this concerto, and loved it.And that is always a problem when a new love comes, it never is like the first time.So what is the problem here? A CD at almost full price that has no liner notes, no information whatsoever, it looks like just a copy I made on my own computer and printer. Two other CDs I bought recently had no texts either and referred to a website to download information, one website even did not exist anymore. If I want to download I would not have bought a CD, or better, when I buy a CD it should be complete, that is the fun of a CD. This one is not."
1,Monsewer Ross Sewage,THE FUNNIEST PART OF YOUR REVIEW IS THAT YOUR A MEMBER OF THE BAND. A LITTLE SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION? ARE YOU PROMOTING? IM SOLD...GOOD JOB
5,Amazing!,"My viola teacher had told me about these strings and so I decided to purchase them... They are everything that everyone says they are! They take about 10-20 minutes to break in and with in that time there should be constant tuning so that your peg doesn't stick and then you sit there almost breaking your hand... But the A string is perfect! There is something about them that give you total control of your dynamics and it really can make your instrument sound even better (even though I play a F.Costa viola from Fein Violins and it sounds amazing already!!). I typically prefer the Helicore C but the C from the Pirastro pack out shines it in every way possible! If you are looking for the best string for the viola, these are your best bet (for synthetic core, if you prefer traditional gut core strings, then Pirastro has those too)."
3,Titanic + Legends of the Fall= A Beautiful Mind,"...while the music is beautiful in the movie, listening to the CD alone is a little aggravating. I kept waiting for the ""Titanic"" overture to begin, and was constantly reminded of the ""Legends of the Fall"" soundtrack. The only saving grace is Charlotte Church's lovely voice, especially on the best track of the CD, A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics. Save your money, borrow or get a copy of this from a friend, and decide for yourself."
1,Come on James Horner!,"It's just like the same score to Pearl Harbor and Field of Dreams. I didn't really like it and I thought it was stupid. The movie was good but the score to it needs a redo. I give the score a D. I guess James was just too tired of making scores he just put a little bit of movie themes to this movie. What a waste of time he did. If you had a suggest to A Beautiful Mind or Field of Dreams what would it be? Field of Dreams because it's the way it meant to be from the movie and it's done really well. Yeah, the movie's breathtaking I thought but the score itself is really dumb. Get Field of Dreams CD don't waste your time on this."
1,The Man Recycles Music,"If I wanted to listen to James Horner, I would have listened to his early works, when he was original. I heard this in both the movie and the CD from a friend. It is basically the same stuff that James Horner wrote in his early days, I can hear stuff from ""Apollo 13"", ""Titanic"", and more. Somebody needs to tell him to cut the repitition. I don't know why he gets nominated for an Oscar for the same stuff!!"
2,Warning to Charlotte Church fans.,"I realize that soundtrack fans will condemn me as a tasteless cad, but I feel my comments will benefit Charlotte Church fans who are considering this CD solely because Charlotte Church is doing the vocals. I am NOT a fan of soundtraack music and consider it largely worthless and boring musically. While it is true that Charlotte Church does ""all the vocals"" on this CD, be fairly warned that there is only one ""song"" on this CD with words to it. It is quite good, as is everything CC does, but don't buy this (as I naively did) thinking you will get a whole album of CC music. If you are a hard core fan of CC (as I am) and simply MUST have everything she has done, buy it. But otherwise, be fairly warned!"
1,Don't buy it.,"Don't get this CD it's a waste of money. There is no music on it, at least nothing you can play on your PC with XP! Just a couple of macromedia interviews and the movie trailer.Rate this piece of junk plastic at minus five stars!"
5,A Beautiful Soundtrack,"I am a big fan of James Horner's music. I often watch movies, he has scored; i.e. Titanic, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, simply to enjoy the music. Having seen ""A Beauriful Mind"" many times, I decided to purchase the soundtrack. While listening, I can envision the scenes that accompany the beautiful, haunting melodies that Mr. Horner has wtitten. It is a total experience that I truly enjoy..."
4,Relaxing...Soothing!,"This soundtrack is what I like to think of as one of Horner's ""freshest"" scores. Despite that the first track sounded somewhat like ""The Machine Age"" from Bicentennial Man, this score is one of his most original. I only rated it with four stars because I did not have a chance to see the movie itself, so the music I heard did not really have a story behind it which I could completely follow. But I'm sure the story would give the music a whole new meaning. It is great to listen to when studying too!"
3,"""original"" opening exactly same as bicentennial man!!!!!","i got this cd last Christmas thinking i was getting a new beautiful ""original"" of Horner, that maybe he wasn't quite washed up....but wait, there was a cd that came out in 99'called bicentennial man that i had always wanted since i had listened to some clips...i then watched the movie bicennman after getting the beautmind cd and my jaw dropped to the floor!!! the opener to bicennman was exactly the same except for charlotte church's voice!!!! if you want the better of the two..pick up bicentennial man!!! even though it borrows alot from braveheart adn deep impact that is actually a good thing!!"
3,"""Variations on a Theme""","I remember sitting in the movie, wondering ""How the heck did they make an entire album out of this soundtrack? It's the same melody over and over!"" The music is beautiful, haunting-- the first track gives me shivers every time I hear it. Yet, every single track on the album comes back to the same theme, usually performed with different instruments. Despite the lack of variety from track to track, I still think this is a great album."
3,A BEAUTIFUL MIND IS TITANIC MEETS TERMS OF ENDEARMENT,"James Horner (Titanic) soundtrack has written a beautiful score, but unfortunately the soundtrack theme is repeated completely through the whole soundtrack. Its like Horner could not get off this one hook.However ""A Beautiful Mind"" has reminisince of ""Titanic"" soundtrack. Horner is following John Williams territory taking a good theme and making variations of it (Superman/Star Wars/Close Encounters).Horners hook is a good one but however is not the best score I have ever heard nor does it break the barriers with motion picture it goes with.My vote goes to ""In the Bedroom"", this soundtrack is a musical feast that takes all levels of the motion picture it surrounds.""A Beautiful Mind"" is where Horner has one hook and runs with it through the whole soundtrack and film, also the soundtrack doesn't seem to fit the complete picture of the movie sometimes going towards sappy.A good to fair soundtrack that doesn't deserve any OSCAR buzz."
5,"Splendid music from one of the best, James Horner.","Unlike some previous reviewers, I believed this score was original and stood on its own. There have been times when Horner has clearly taken old material and simply changed a few lines of music. A Beautiful Mind is not one of those scores. It has some of the most refreshing tracks and some very dark ones that create a nice touch. This score is worth the buy for any Horner fans. If you are not familiar with his music, try Field of Dreams of Braveheart first."

4,Helpful,"The book was very helpful in allowing us to set up our travels to Italy next year. It gave us insight as to what to see, where to go, and important information one needed to know when traveling in Italy. Thanks"
5,Italy for Dummies,I received this book very quickly and gathered some important information for my trip to Italy.
4,' Old School ' Kungfu,"These nostalgic films, while technologically primitive by today's standards, brought back memories of when ' kungfu ' movies were about more action than drama."
5,Loved it as usual,"The recipes were great. I like that we are rid of some unsavory characters. I do like Hannah, I have to admit I am on team Norman."
5,Peach Cobbler Murder by Joanne Fluke,Peach Cobbler Murder (Hannah Swensen Mysteries)I was very satisfied with my purchase. I would buy from this seller again.
1,Losing interest...,"I think this will be the last Cookie Jar murder I read. I have found that since about the second book I have either been able to figure out quite easily who the killer was because there is a very clear pattern to the writing. Ms. Fluke usually makes a brief mention of a new character or a minor event that usually gives it away. I find myself reading quickly to get to the end of the book to see that I am right every time. I am never surprised, and I don't find that interesting or fun. I'm also weary of the Mike/Norman situation. Seriously, who can get to know two men well enough to receive proposals from both of them. It's too silly to enjoy. Hannah would get SO jealous when Mike spent time with Shawna Lee, yet it's ok for her to blatantly have two boyfriends. Ridiculous. I'm moving on to another series...."
3,Not all it's cooked up to be,Too much talk and very little action. Bad ending. Poor publishing (spelling error on p. 77 and typo on p. 147).
2,Too condescending,"Does Fluke think that her readers can't connect the dots? Every joke is explained, it is just too much. And the cat ""talking"" to her is just a little too much. Hannah is a little too smug in this one - she leads people to believe that her cat is killing rodents but she doesn't really have them do it. She's rude about anyone who watches their figure or wears make up. The story line in this one is just weak. She is downright rude sometimes then so non-confrontational later. But my biggest problem is that she lets Mike get away with dating someone who tried to run her out of business. I've loved several of her previous novels because they are fun, but the over explaining is just getting to be too much."
5,yum yum,"flukes books are becoming as additive as her cookies. they are warm, just like her cookie ovens, albeit lake eden is a very cold place. somehow the cold takes on a warmth of its own while reading her books. just like her cookies, her books keep getting better and better. what a delightful read from a very down to earth writer who knows exactly how to get to a guys heart---thru his stomach. keep those boods and cookies coming."
5,Peach Cobbler Murder & Sugar Cookie Murder,"I really like the style of Joanne Fluke's books. I have them all now. She is tasteful. I don't have to worry about explicit sex, graphic details of a murder. She is my new #1 mystery writer!! I am anxiously waiting for the next book! Thank you, Joanne, you make my day. I love to wind down a day by reading your books. Lois Sheppard (my husband orders for me)"
2,More soap opera than mystery,"This series is very variable in quality, but this one was particularly disappointing. It must be hard to balance ongoing character development against individual plot-lines in a series like this, but this book had more soap opera than sleuthing: the body didn't turn up until after 1/3 of the way through. I'll read on, because some of the earlier books have been good, but I might start looking for a replacement for this series as my source of light-and-fluffy reads."
2,Why all this murder?,Fluke's narrational talent deserves a better canvas than mere murder. Her stochastic plot cadence makes even Joyce seem orderly and organized.
4,Another good Cookie,"This book is a good read. The build-up lags some, but the ending is more of a cliff-hangar than most of Fluke's Hannah Swensen stories. And, the last recipe sounds divine!"
2,Not his father's Black Stallion,"Like other reviewers, I am an adult returning to the ongoing Black Stallion series that I loved as a child. I'm sure Steven Farley is a good writer, but his style is not his father's and his efforts to continue the Black Stallion stories from his father should be put to rest. The violent deaths of three horses in this book are enough to halt any fan of Walter Farley's. The relationship between the Black and Alec is missing the depth and understanding that readers of the series are used to. Time to go back to the originals and leave these new stories to others less familiar with Walter Farley's work."
3,It's okay,"I grew up reading Walter Farley's Black Stallion series. Although Steven is trying, he will never write the Black like his father did. I like how this book took Alec and the Black off of the race track and into new territory, and how the Black had to deal with his fear, making him more ""real"", and mortal, but it just wasn't the same. And the timing doesn't make sense. The Black is only 8 years old? I don't think so. It was exciting in spots, but the writing is too different; it doesn't feel like a ""real"" Black Stallion book. Maybe Steven should have just left the series alone."
1,I didn't like it,"I'm sorry, I just didn't like the book. I think all writers have a style of their own, and I don't like Steven's way of writing. He doesn't seem to put as much feeling into the description of Alec during the race, and in other parts too. As a matter of fact, I wish he would just leave his father's series the way it is and not add on to it. And I don't like the way he portrays Alec in the other series about the colt, Raven. What I'm trying to say is that I don't like any of his books."
2,Tedious and boring,"I'm sorry I didn't discover anything in this book that wouldn't be ""common sense"" to anyone over the age of twelve who has ever owned a house. Don't waste your time unless you are totally clueless...then again the price was rightfree so why not read it just in case you learned something."
3,Black Diamond II,Very little readable material. Just a bunch of dates and lists of people. Disappointed to say the least.
5,Surprisingly intricate & sensitive playing by the composer,"What a phenomenal pianist Prokofiev was! The most difficult 1st movement is played in incredible speed (4 second faster than William Kapell!). Piano sounds a little muffled at times, but sensitive brilliance of his playing still comes through if you set your amplifier in direct mode. He plays 9 Vision fugitives, Suggestion diabolique, Etude and other 7 piano pieces with amazing intricacy and composer's own insight. A revelatory historical document of composer's own interpretation!"
3,Worth watching but frustrating,"Years ago I wrote scathing review of the VHS edition of this movie, but time (and multiple re-watching) have mellowed me to some extent. It is true that Matt Frewer's overacting (not to mention his strange accent) are, at times, hard to take, but it is also true that Kenneth Welsh is excellent as Dr. Watson and the Canadian countryside doubling as the Moor is nice. Truth be told, this is the SH story which depends the least on The Great Detective since he is absent for so much of the time. There are at least seven different DVD versions of Hound of the Baskervilles, and there is something to love (and not) about each of them. All in all, this movie is worth watching and is a bargain of a price."
1,Perfume,"I am not satisfied at all, after charging me for the purchase and send me a notification of the estimated date of arrival, you send me an email informing me that the product was not available. This is very unprofessional"
4,Decoupage the Traditional Way,"In this Dover publication Hasbrouck Rawlings brings together a myriad diverse prints for hand coloring and black and white techniques. The few colored prints included are not very useful and are of poor quality, but the wide variety of engravings have something for most decoupeurs. The instructions on how to begin are very traditional and do not take account of the latest advances in the hobby - such as ""New Decoupage"" by Durwin Rice. Even so, both beginers and more advanced students are likely to find this source book inspirational - especially if you are keen to hand color your work and want a ""period"" feel. Good value for money but not a first book for beginers."
3,Play it again,"This is a good movie. It's not great but sometimes life is like that too. Not all neat and clean but more like something one lives through. I think it's a good story of what happens when you're in love, the other person moves on and you're not ready to let go. If you've never felt that you probably won't get this movie."
5,sublime singing from a mixed choir without ego!,"I hate it when a cd I love gets deleted, conversely there is a good reason why something get reprinted. In this case the original recording was a statement that female vocies could sound as one! Musicainship to die for and the music is not mainstream by any stretch of the imagination.Mystical harmonies and magical progressions caress my soul when I listen to this music, I feel I am a better person for having done so. Better, buy two copies because the 1st person that you loan it to, may have just developed short term memory problems. My wife was spellbound and she likes Nora Jones, go figure."
1,marvel game - not worth it,"we received this toy already used as a gift for our 4 year old. My husband tried it out, and it was not fun, and already seemed broken. We returned it right away."
3,The first one,"This is the first of this new series I can recommend. So why only 3 stars?Well this Vol still suffers the same issues the previous two do. The pace of the show is to rapid, the characters are weakly represented, this one has even more of that needless and jarring switch in art style (the comedy bits), and what parts this one shares with the original anime, are done better in the original.So why recommend it? because this is the first Vol that significantly diverges from the original anime story wise. This new one apparently follows the manga closer than the original anime did. Which means folks we are getting more of the Hellsing story. While I do wish this new one was done as well as the original, I can overlook some of that to see the continuation of the Hellsing story, something the original anime definately left me wanting more of.For those wondering about the original anime, take a look at it here:Hellsing (Complete Boxed Set)"
3,"nice reference, but . . .",nice reference but without an audio track to help understand exactly how its suppose to sound it makes it difficult to understand. It came with a cd with a few references and I can do those but everything else Im kind of lost on
5,"Learning from a Master ""Boinker""","I am amazed at the boinks, pops, whistles, boings, chirps, gurgles, and other believable sound effects coming from my mouth, nose, and maybe even my ears(?) after spending only a few minutes in this coach's book and CD!I always thought these sound effects could easily come from someone else, but never me. Guess what? (sliding upward whistle!) I can! I'm no Jim Backus yet, but who knows where one well-placed boing, or ""Wat's up, Doc?"" can take me!Seriously, I recommend this highly for the beginner, or seasoned voice actor who needs to add repertoire or depth."
1,You're too dreamy,"Most people will never figure out these sounds, they are near impossible.He is most excellent and talented, but this stuff is very difficult!"
2,Not for kids,"I bought several of these books for grandsons-ages 10 thru 21, thinking they would be lots of fun for them and sort of silly. They were not that type of book. They were more on the serious side for people who might have need to be able to make strange sounds (as in storytelling or maybe broadcasting etc). I think the cover was a little misleading."
4,20 years later and I still use tips from this book,"I first bought Mouthsounds in the early 1980s. Now, more than 20 years later, I still regularly employ the Taxi Whistle, stomach growl and barking dog for hailing cabs (it really works) and entertaining the under-5 set. At that time, the book contained a vinyl record, so the CD is a necessary update. Enjoy!"
5,Everyone needs this!,"I bought one for my godson, and when it came, I tried out some of the noises. The directions are easy to follow, and the extra commentary in the book is hilarious. I was able to make the noises right away, and they were so funny I kept making myself laugh! I ordered another one right away for another kid. What an awesome gift!"
1,not BPA free??,Not sure how I ended up with these- I am usually so careful about BPA. I wish I could return but I opened them trying to see if there was info about BPA on the insert. Nowhere does it say BPA free.
2,Not her best!,I am a great fan of Andrea Marcovicci but was disappointed with her selection of World War II songs. Two many songs crammed onto one cd - I didn't even find time to sing along! And the choice of songs were not favorites - except The White Cliffs of Dover.
4,Very good cd.,This cd provided songs and some history of them that met what I had expected and looked forward to listening to. This has been very good listening time.
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this griddle because of its size. I can't keep up with the 4 kids when making pancakes with the one I have. After I opened the box, I was disappointed with the quality. The griddle part had rough edges, the threaded holes for the handles in the aluminum were somewhat stripped, the screws for the handles were too short. Rather than going through the pain of returning the thing, I am going to try to purchase some new screws that will hold the handle on tightly. Hopefully it will work once I get the handles put on!"
4,Now ships assembled with proper screws,"Purchased this expecting to replace the screws as mentioned in many of the other reviews. Was pleasantly surprised to find that it came assembled and the legs feel rock solid. The only surprise for me was that it was aluminum and much lighter than I expected (not necessarily a bad thing). From the description ""Heavy Cast Surface"", I had assumed cast iron and not noticed that the more detailed description listed aluminum."
2,Bad castings for griddle,"Evidentally, Broil king does not look at responses to quality issues. I bought this, thinking that problems with the screws in the casting would have been resolved by now, but no. Inserted the screws and without much pressure at all, two of the screws slipped out. I believe the problem is with screw castings that are too large. I called the company and they were willing to replace the unit, but that is not the issue here. There should not be such a minor defect, which can be resolved either with larger screws or proper threading of the aluminum castings that has been reported to them before"
1,Bad Deal,I put this together Christmas morning to make pancakes and one of the screws that attach the legs would not stay in. The surface is flat with just a little curve. Not at all what I expected for the price.
5,"Duane ""chef"" Fay",It seems to be a good product except for a small problem with the screws that install the legs. However chumbadeals.com were very courteous and professionl about handling the problem.
1,This is a poor designed product,This grill is not worth the money. The bolts which hold the legs fall out and the edge (or sides) of the grill are too short.
2,Not a $400 griddle,"Not a $400 dollar griddle. If I saw this item in a store, I might pay $50 dollar for it but definately nowhere near $400."
4,Would make a great gift,"I like the size of the pan and the price can't be beat. I cooked chicken in the pan and the charred black stains won't come off, but oh well, the pan is still useable. For $9 this can't be beat and it comes packaged as a gift set. The smell of the hand soap and the lotion are barely detectable but pleasant; and to buy a similar soap or lotion seperately the cost would be around $4 to $5 each."
4,Great background for my upcoming trip to Greece,We are going to Greece this spring and I am trying to read stories of ancient Greece that are not dry. This one is great fun. The story of Ithaka while Odysseus was gone.
2,i don't like it,"I've had this camera for almost 3 years. For some reason, I was attracted to all of the features and low price. I wish I had done more research. Video is okay. not good when it's dark. It's a little bulky and feels poorly built. It does not have a 5 mega pixel camera like it states. It's more like 2.5. The zoom is also very choppy. If it get's too hot or cold outside, it won't work. The sound is bad since you can hear the internal parts of the camera working when you play it back. All in all. It was I mistake I learned from. I've done my research, and Soon I'll be getting a much better camera that I'm not embarrassed to carry around."
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this camera. The night vision doesn't work and the Flash is pathetic. It also requires very bright light or being outside otherwise everything is in shadow. This would be a good camera for a child to play with but not for someone who wants a real camcorder.
5,It will change your life!,"Two sections are absolutely incredible in this book-- that of ""Rational Self-Interest"" and ""Death Anxiety"". Dr. Branden uses REASON as his perfect way to convey his ideas. He is the first author in this area, that does not look at self-esteem as if it is something by itself that you ""work on"". Instead, he reveals what it really is, and how it comes about from REAL choices and actions; thus, it is based in reality. Dr. Branden's books are rare to me in that I read them almost continually; while other books are useful and good, I would put them on my shelf and re-read them only occassionally. I am ALWAYS reading at least one of Branden's books at any time, continually."
1,!!Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I was looking into self-esteem, for a paper on Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. Self-esteem being the 4th grouping of needs, so I bought this book. Ugh, how I wish I hadn't! Bored me to death. You'd be better off just reading articles online or looking else where. Nothing insightful to be gleaned, by and large. Don't Waste Your Money!"
5,"Top notch ""self help book"" for issues of low self esteem","The author, Nathaniel Branden is one of my favorites for easy reading concerning complex human psychology as it relates to our relationships to significant others and to our selves. A must read for those looking to broaden self-knowledge to help be all that one can be not only for self but also for community."
5,rabid horseman attacks!,this toy is awsome! it makes sound and moves when you press a button. it is so cool! every Yu-Gi-Oh fan should have this toy.
3,Okay,"This is okay, but it's not Evanescence :) I don't think I would remember this one. Don't like the singing, either; feel very laboured."
3,Interesting metal made in Italy,"Tystnaden is an Italian band with a Swedish band name (which means something like quiet/silent). Their obvious influences from Swedish metal is the reason behind the name of the band.The songs on the cd mostly have traditional metal arrangements, but you can also hear that they try to bend the rules of ""the book of heavy metal"".Solid musicianship comes to mind when listening to the record and singer Laura De Luca has a voice with a personal touch (and of course an Italian accent).The first song on the album, ""First Embrace"" is a fantastic track as well as ""Münchausen Syndrome"" and ""Tystnaden"".All in all, a very good first effort from an interesting band who deserves a lot of listeners. Do you wanna try something new? Buy ""Sham Of Perfection""!"
4,Need more options with recipe alternatives,A comprehensive book on theory and application. Recipes can include more alternatives for a worldwide audience searching for raw materials. Overall a good reference book.
5,Awesome informative book,I found this book to be well written with pertinent information. It has a great review of essential oils as well as hydrosols SAFE for pets. Great for anyone looking to formulate more healthful remedies for their dog or cat. Great selection of recipies. What was a bit disappointing is a lot of the resources no longer exist. Doing a search brought up tons of locals so I would say this is a definite ADD to your Library.
5,Holistic Aroma Therapy for Animals,"This book is well written, easy to comprehend and provides detailed information. The reading is enjoyable and very educational. I particularly appreciate the care taken to describe what makes high quality products, and why and how so many product are not truly pure or of the highest quality. I also appreciated the many excellent references and the case studies that were sited.The information is science based. Cautions for use are emphasized and described for different species. The descriptions of individual essential oils and hydrosols are excellent. There are many recipes for specific problems. This a book that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the subject regardless of their level of expertise."
4,Helpful Resource,"The information in this book is truly helpful. As someone who has been looking for holistic remedies for myself, it suddenly occurred to me, ""wouldn't I want the same for my animals?"" Absolutely! Immediately I began looking for resources. ""Holistic Aromatherapy for Animals"" gave me many tips and encouragement. When it came to recommendations for purchasing essential oils, however, I disagree with the author's opinion of not using companies that use a multi-level or networking format to purchase the oils. Some of the best oils on the planet are available this way. I personally use these oils on myself and my animals and would trust nothing else. Please don't throw out the ""baby with the bathwater"" in looking for quality essential oils."
4,This was a gift for a friend....,...therefore I cannot really evaluate it until she tells me how she likes it. I felt it was the most complete book available for her interest.
3,Jim Thome,"This figure is very realistic looking with great detail! I have about 10 McFarlane sports figures, and have like all of them........McFarlane is doing a great job providing high quality figures at a good price........they are much, much better than the old Starting Lineup figures I used to collect."
3,argh =-(,"his hands don't go together so it looks like the bat is floating. also, i can't get the nob end of the bat into his right hand. this wouldn't be too bad if his back leg wasn't hanging over the end of the dirt. i'm really sad. i guess you're not supposed to take them out of the box. on a good note he looks great detail wise. and he is very sturdy and heavy, not cheaply made."
5,Daycare kids loved it!,Bought for my daycare kids to listen too at our Halloween Party...they all loved it and had fun shaking their bootys!
5,Highly Recommended.,"Dr. Goldenberg's experiences and feelings are conveyed with clarity and emotion. This slim affected me more powerfully than some other Holocaust memoirs I have read - not because it is any more horrifying than other accounts, but because of the way Dr. Goldenberg was able to survive, and surmount so much in the end. I was also struck by the frankness with which he writes of the unendurable. Perhaps most moving of all, however, is the transcript of his remarks to his family in 1985, found at the end of his book - a reminder of why we must never allow the Holocaust to be forgotten. Besides adults, this would be an excellent book for adolescents, or anyone learning about the Holocaust, to read."
4,I Respect The Efforts & Hard Work of Filmmaker Cheryl Matlock,"Being a filmmaker myself that has to do just about everything like Ms. Matlock has, I respect and love the hard work, money, and time she gave to this film. Some funny subplots and some good heartwarming scenes. Believable quality performances by Cheryl Matlock & Shaun Conway. I look forward to the next works from Matlock."
5,Amazing.,"I thoroughly enjoy Dynasty Warriors 4. I enjoy every Dynasty game! Modeled after one of the greatest Chinese Epics, the story of the Three Kingdoms, the game actually follows battles, characters, and history closely. Though we all know that Sima Yi didn't actually have magic powers and neither did Pang Tong, that doesn't make it any less fun! This is one of my favorite games. Excellent opportunities to create battle strategies and spark interest in Ancient Chinese History. My only critique of the game is that I wish that instead of just playing with a second player in a battle, I wish we could play each other....other than that, no complaints here! Great fun."
5,GET THIS GAME,Just got back from playin this at my cousins house. IT WAS AWESOME! There's so much to do! You and your friend can fight side by side in over 100 different battles! GET THIS GAME NOW! IT IS AMAZING!
5,Continues to impress,This game is a great continuation of the series. It has all the things I enjoy about DW4 plus a few new modes which allow for shorter battle sessions. If you like DW4 then you will love this game. A definite buy.
2,Not a good game,This game is not a good one especially if you own Dynasty Wariors 3. All the battles suck and the weapons are the same the only thing that is different is the uniforms and their faces as well as the battle scenes. This game is not one you should own if you have the third one.
4,"It's like 3, but with better stuff!!","I just traded in part 3 for $$ and bought this one! It's great! They made a lot of improvements including:Less lag!!Not as many units pop out of nowhereWeapons level up and automatically replace eachotherItems automatically replace eachotherYou can rename your body guardsDuel mode allows you to duel in a 1 v 1 arena (but if you die, you lose the level)""Magic"" (Phantom Soldiers are invincible unless you disable the spell)New Items types (Equip a saddle, an orb, and 1+ (depending on level) items as found in prev. Dyn. Warriors games).A ""Encylopedia"" to check character infoCons:You cant just play a later level w/ a low level character to get their 3rd weapon (you have to level it up to get it)If you liked the previous games, you will definately enjoy this one! It's definately worth selling your older version to get this great new installment to the improving series!"
4,A very good Sleepover game,"If you think your going to beat the game with EVERY POSSIBLE charachter, then you won't need any other game for about, hmm...4 years? Trust me, you'll get to it one day and pick up the controller, turn on your ps2, then go...'Ehh....I don't really feel like it'. Trust me. I did. Don't get me wrong, its a good game, but it has a poor storyline, no blood/gore, and nothing but...fighting. Just lots and lots of killing(making it a good sleepover game). What I really liked about this game, is that its about 98% True. Seriously. Look up these guys. They were all Ancient Chinese warriors. The only thing is I think Koei tweaked the storyline. Good Luck & have fun."
4,A little hard,"This game is very entertaining, but some of the people are a bit hard, especially Lu Bu, with can kill you without breaking a sweat in 2 moves. 2 players is fun but the map is very confusing and it is easy to get seperated and if one person dies, you both lose."
1,"This is a 107 key, keyboard with 3 keys in the wrong place.","If you want to try out a classic Belkin 104 key keyboard, they do make one. It's the Belkin 104 key F8E206-USB Classic Keyboard. See:http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&Section;_Id=100&pcount;=&Product;_Id=22227#I wish manufactures would stick to standards and make a good basic keyboard before they try to get fancy!"
2,overpriced,"undoubtedly mr. miller knows his pilates. however, this is a self-published, overpriced transcription of lectures and journal entries, rife with ""inaudibles"" and ""unintelligible questions"". for seekers of in depth information on the pilates method, i suspect it would be more satisfying to refer to joseph pilates' original works, or that of alan menezes."
5,Very smooth. Satisfaction guaranteed!,"""~Early eighties. Three young guys (16, 18 and 18) from Philadelphia record some marvellous albums under the guidance of an old hand, Grover Washington, Jr. This was the first one to be released in 1981! Very smooth, very warm. Jazz, funk, soul, samba, and above all: TASTE! ""~""~ and play it on a lazy weekend day, a warm summer night, or on a winter evening."
4,pieces of a beginning........,"this album is bad.....superbad when you realize that the sounds of this lp comes from 3 young cats from philly, barely into their teens, and grooving out like a mug!! the title track is just a groovy, funked out, mellow piece of work that deserves to be played over and over and over again!! i mean, the soothing fender rhodes keyboard, the funky bass, and melody shine like no other grooove i've ever heard!! this is what nighttime relaxing is for, for playing smooth numbers like this. the rest of the lp is as good as the title track, and these cats deserve thier time in the spotlight, and they are still playing to this day!!"
1,So disappointed,Based on the reviews I thought this would be a great product. It creates a very unnatural line and it clumps like old mascara. It's garbage! I'm going back to my cheap beauty store pencils.
4,very satisfied-the only waterproof brow liner i've tried,styli-style product. I first found this product at CVS but they no longer carry it. I was panicking so I searched on my pc and found it. I haven't seen it anywhere else.
2,Just doesn't suit me,"It's too soft, so the product smears when you apply it. And if you freeze the brow product it then becomes to crumbly to apply to the brow. It's the devil to sharpen, too. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product."
1,Superb Product / Fatally Flawed Delivery System,"I love this product because my eyebrows stay on despite repeated face-wipings at the gym. BUT... the manufacturer needs to put it in a mechanical twist dispenser, not as a pencil that needs to be sharpened. Why? Because most of the product ends up as a gooey blob in the innards of your pencil sharpener. I've tried a razor, a little sharp knife, and THREE different size sharpeners, all to no avail. I finally just now threw the (expletive omitted) thing away, which pained me deeply because the stuff inside the pencil is so fabulous.If anybody knows a foolproof way to sharpen this pencil, please share. There's a dear."
4,Good companion to his Standard,"...I don't claim any good talent in pool, but i do enjoy reading up on all the strategies and thought processes, and attempting to apply them when I play. Byrne's Advanced Technique isn't so much for advanced players only, but covers some specific topics that aer very interesting as well, such as the half-ball hit, the masse shot, the physics of the heavy tavern cueball, and so on. The section on Three-Cushion billiards is somewhat redundant, though, if you have his Standard. but it has some other topics, including more shots from master play, to keep one engrossed. He also writes some stories on several of the games greats, including three-cushion legends like Ceulemans and Blohmdal. Overall, a very good buy if you want to know as much about the game as you can."
3,Byrne's Advanced Techniques......,"I found the book useful, but not as revealing of new info as I had hoped. His basic book has much more useful info."
4,Mahler at its best!,"I'm a big fan of Mahler and it comes to no surprise that I consider his Symphony No. 3 one of my favorites. Owning the entire CD symphony cycle, I definitely was looking to add DVD video of each performance. The video quality was a bit grainy at times but I guess it's suppose to be all about the music and the orchestra/conductor rather than special effects and video quality. It was funny to see over on the balcony seats some folks were fast asleep. I guess they must've have a long day prior to attending this performance, eh?"
3,"Subject matter excellent -- presentation, eh!","I love Eve Ensler and most of what she does, but I did not find this to be well put together. I still would keep it in my library, but I was somewhat disappoionted in the presentation."
3,Broke out of the box!,"Had not heard this musician before. Not what I expected, but I still have this CD and listen every once-in-awhile. Not my usual cup of tea, but I like it."
5,Thomo Does It Again!,"Another superlative CD from Richard Thompson. Lyrically and instrumentally he is without peer. I keep expecting the odd bad record, but they just don't come from this genius of folk-rock. Together with Neil Young and possibly Van Morrison, he is the only artist whose CD I would buy unheard."
3,not as good as his last works,"I think that the cd's he put out in the 90's and '00's are better then this offering. This does not have the guitar solos and storytelling that I love so much in RT's music. Just my opinion! Also - why is ""Dads gonna kill me"" listed as an I-tunes exclusive? It is on my cd!Get this cd if you are a die-hard but if you are looking for some winning cd's check out: Rumor, Mock, Kit bag and Austin live from RT."
4,four and 1/2 stars.,"this is what one has come to expect from mr thompson. great songwriting, great voice, great guitar. what i want to comment on here mostly is that guitar. this is mr thompson's first electric guitar based album in a few years, and the break he took away from it seems to have paid off well. his return to the instrument (at least on record) sounds like someone just discovering their own brilliance, just riding up a peak of genius. the electric guitar work here is astonishing. fresh, creative, and a joy to listen to. makes me wish that i had talent. you go, guy."
3,Unfortunately I've heard most of it before...,"...on other Richard Thompson albums. Wish I was more dazzled by this one, but I'm not."
5,DVD player: $100.......this cooking DVD: priceless!!!,"If you're a vegetarian (or vegan), enjoy cooking (or not), or just want to learn how to make delicious & flavorful dishes that are 100% nutritious, this is the DVD for you!After receiving & viewing this DVD, I ended up buying two more; one for my dad who has high cholesterol & one for my best friend as a birthday gift.Eating healthy doesn't have to be troublesome or unsatisfying. The hosts of this fun & educational DVD show you just how easy it is to create enticing & satisfying dishes for every season of the year - dishes you'll want to make over & over again!Where can I get the soundtrack?"
4,Nicely done and basic,"Ok, I've seen much better quality in cooking videos, and have seen more rehearsed hosts, but this video does hit the highlights of cooking vegetarian and offers some useful tips along the way."
4,Good for New Vegetarians,"I am a new vegetarian, and this DVD really helped me get out of the Veggie-burger-rut! They explain things in very simple terms and I feel that they really gear their explanations and insights towards beginner vegetarians, such as myself. Would make a good gift for someone thinking about becoming a vegetarian."
5,The Mardudjara Aborigines: Living the Dream in Australia's Desert (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology),"Well written, wonderful reflection of one Australian Aboriginal language group's beliefs and society, as well as the effects of colonisation.Highly recommended."
3,"If the HEA is anticipated, does that erotocize all sexual adventures?","Please read the other effusive reviews for this book!While the promise of an HEA is always tantalizingly present, yet also distant (until the very end), the heroine engages with great glee (and glorious orgasms)in all manner of recreational and submissive sexual escapades. Because this novel is directed to a female readership, that leaves me a bit confused.Perhaps for female readers of this particular novel, the HEA is just enjoyable frosting on the cake.Not judging, just trying to understand the pervasive insistence (on forums and in reviews) among so many female readers that they find ""impersonal"" sex non-erotic."
3,A lot of fun but a little disappointing,I enjoy this book no end but I would have preferred a little bit more variety of subjects rather than the same one being repeated dressed up differently.
3,Great Works,To make a good work with a small amount of wood try that skills and have great work of art projects.
2,This book tries to be everything but succeeds to be nothing,"I wouldn't recommend this book. It assumes you're a complete computer novice, and thereby wastes a lot of pages explaining concepts like LAN, Internet and so on. It then goes on to describing the Java core language with ill-written examples. Now and then, chapters about writing applets appear at random places. There are also chapters about ""The Software Development Process"". All this doesn't leave much room for what the book is supposed to deal with.The interesting parts of Java (and OOP) are given a shallow coverage, and suddenly the book is over, leaving you hungry for more. Get another book, or learn Java from Sun's website. Considering the fast development of the Java language, it's probably the safest bet."
4,This book rocks!,"This book was recommended by my professor for my CSE class at Arizona State University. The most helpful aspect of the book, I feel, is the API. It serves as a quick reference and helped me a lot while coding. But the book spends too much time on basic concepts like the Internet, LAN, and computer architecture. The examples are pretty good, but are confusing at times. The book sometimes gives you too much to chew. But even so, it is really good. Though I wouldn't really recommend it as a book to start learning Java (without any high level language experience), it serves as a wonderful source for reference and strengthens concepts. The section on applets is really good, but concurrent with other instances in the book, the examples are a little confusing. It takes a while to sink in. All in all, the book is pretty good... Actually, it ROCKS!"
1,Worst book for beginners!!,"I have had previous training in JAVA and C++. I got this book for a beginner's Class and more than clearing concepts it confused me with its examples and haphazard way of text. The more important concepts are left out and the trivial ones focussed on unecessarily. It is certainly not a beginner's book, I would personally not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn JAVA. This is not a book to be used as a textbook as well."
1,This book doesn't explain concepts clearly.,Not a good book to learn Java programming concepts. Get another book
2,Not for first timers.,"The first several chapters is filled with wealth of information that anyone can understand, java application and applets can run. The book CLEARLY forget to mention about case sensitivity, and rules in java programming. That's where many of beginning programmer could get lost at.Lack of step by step process, or information about what each syntax of the language does. Those are few keys point sorely needed in the book.I speak on behalf for all college students who has no prior experience in programming language, that they spent their precious lives away on program that refused to run."
2,Relies too heavily on vaguely-explained code,"This book is not a very good choice if you are looking for a good introduction to Java. I have read more than half of it and I am still unclear on how to implement object oriented ideas in programming. I have taken classes on object oriented design, database design, and some UML, but this book doesn't really give reasons for writing programs the way they are written in the examples. Most of the other students in my class (an upper division master of information systems class) are also a little sketchy on why things are done the way they are in the examples in the book. They usually just copy code from the examples to finish class assignments (as I do, also). After reading the reviews for Beginning Java Objects, I am eager to get that book before I kill my grade (currently an 'A') in the class."
4,Easy to understand but keypoints missed,Very educational and easy to comprehend but reader should be adviced that there is nothing covering the parts write to- and read from file.
3,errors in 6th edition...see link for publisher corrections,"I've just started using this textbook for a class, so I can't review the book yet.But wanted to post the link to Pearson's (the publisher) corrections:[...]"
2,java software solution 7th edition lewis/loftus,"I had to contact Pearson education to find the videos that are mentioned in the book, but everything i did was in vain.I chatted with the customer service and the result is they do not know what i was talking about.in the book there is no guide of how to get to those videos plus the fact that the customer service at Pearson is the worst.on page 130 there is a mistake that says the value under the root is negative, however it should be said that it should said the value should be positive.on page 162 they run the program and got the result where the class Die has not been defined yet.On page 164 there is no relation between figure 4.2 and the rest of the result that preceded it.The reader should be attentif to those mistakes .I think the authors were rushed to update to this edition."
4,Altight,"It has some easy concepts, but it will not help if you actually need to do a real project. It will be a good book for a starter."
2,Emphasis on beginning,"In case you're doubting how much of a beginner's book this is, consider that the first chapter of this book is all about telling you what a computer is. If you have any experience writing any sort of script or program you will not want this book. If, like for me, it's required for a course, keep an eye on the bookstore's textbook buyback schedule.Even once you have learned what's taught in this book, you will probably find it frustrating if you try to use it as a reference for Java syntax. Information about the language is dribbled out in bits and pieces with no clear way to find what you're looking for. Well, yes, there's a table of contents and an index, but you'll do better selling this book back and picking upJava In A Nutshell, 5th Editiononce you have some familiarity with Java."
1,The Decline and Fall of a once good book.,This used to be a good book for a first and second semister course in Java. It has now been turned into a garish waste of time and money.
5,A breath of fresh air,I read this book and found the answer I was looking for. My 1957 home had been upgraded and insulated so well that it was acting as a bottle. Basically my indoor humidity was up at past 65% RH and my poorly insulated exterior walls were getting down to the low 50F in the colder months of the SF Bay area. No one could explain why I was getting mold in my closets. I found this book at an architectural book store and everything clicked. I may be the first person to install a ventilation system on my type of home but I had the confidence to do so after reading this book. Now I have a well ventilated home and no more mold. Thanks you!!!
4,entertaining and informative,"A fascinating account of the spread of hysterical fears of being buried alive at multiple times and places in human history, with a common origin in both fact and legend. What I found most interesting was the clash between the purveyors of irrational fears and the attempted refutations by incredibly poor skeptical critics (e.g., proponent Bruhier was more scientific than critic Louis), but the movement died out seemingly of its own accord. Bondeson does an excellent job of bringing together the relevant data from history, legend, medicine, art, and literature, into an entertaining and informative book, in some ways similar to Mary Roach's <EM>Stiff</EM> but without quite that level of irreverence."
3,Yawn. Good in lLaces,"A detailed history about people being buried alive. Not very readable as it seems to linger on a subject then repeat a previous subject, but interesting all the same, if gruesome."
2,Not Appropriate for Young Children,"I bought this book as a present for my goddaughter, who is three, thinking it could be read to her. While the pictures are beautiful, the text is way too advanced for the 4-8 age range listed (eight years might be the lower end of the range for this book). The main reason I am returning it, however, is because of the description of the following episode: ""A time came when Myra suffered a great famine and people were starving to death. A wicked innkeeper kidnapped three little boys, killed them, and salted them in a tub of brine, intending to serve them as food.""! St. Nicholas rescues them and brings them back to life, but this is a terrifying story to relate to young children and I can't see how it could have been judged appropriate for them."
5,Exquisite paintings and story of St. Nicholas,This book is our most cherished Christmas book. The pictures are absolutely lovely and the story is compelling. The book is truly a work of art.
2,Catholic version of Saint Nicholas,"The book is very well illustrated and has nice details about the life of Saint Nicholas, but it implies (as the title indicates) certain things to be true, which are more or less legendary and carry the bias of the Roman Catholic perspective. I'm not a skeptic to the mystical or miraculous, but when such things seem to be a plug for Roman Catholic tradition, I think the source of the legend is evident."
3,"Interesting, but...","Got if for my 7 year old, named Nicolas. Not really the best thing for younger children considering some of the legends."
5,Finally - a book telling the real story of St. Nicholas,"I purchased the Legend of Saint Nicholas on the recommendation from another person to sell at our Church Bookstore. I think the book is excellent and tells more about St. Nicholas' life than is generally known. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in their child knowing the real story about ""Santa Claus"". The illustrations are beautiful and in the dress of the time when St. Nicholas lived. My only objection is the picture on the page where the story about the year 325 during the reign of the Emperor Constantine I. The Bishop's hats are fashioned after today's Cardinal hats in the Roman Catholic Church. St. Nicholas lived when the Christian Church was in its relative infancy and the Bishops of the Church did not wear those hats. I wish they had been more authentic."
3,landowska - scarlatti,happy to have reveived a cd with wanda landowska playing.yet so sad that it was not possible to filter better the noise.d.weihs
5,Great for the busy woman,"This book is accurate for any woman in today's busy world. Organizing my life, starting with my wardrobe, really made a difference with how I looked and felt for the rest of my day. Linda's book is a fast read and easy to follow. It has been a good tool in planning for what I want to accomplish of each day."
1,Piece of junk,Bought 6 of these--you can't see the bulb light through the heavy blue plastic. Returned for credit--got an RMA from company but never received credit on credit card--been 1 month.
3,Amborsia - Live,"Amborsia - Standing Room OnlyThis CD is a product of being recorded from a concert at Santa Anna, CA in 2002. There are 10 tracks and no linear notes on the inside of the front cover. If listing this CD, there should be an indication if these are original tracks, live recordings, etc. The tracks are:1 - Nice, Nice, Very Nice2 - Livin' On My Own3 - You're The Only Woman (You & I)4 - And ... Somewhere I've Never Traveled5 - Time Waits For No One6 - How Much I Feel7 - Magical Mystery Tour8 - Drink Of Water9 - Holdin' On To Yesterday10 - Biggest Part Of Me"
4,Good Book,Very nice book. good for kids that are trying to work through death. Very Sweet and it helped us too.
5,This is a wonderful book!!,"This is a wonderful book, not just for children, but also for adults. It is very comforting. I have purchased this book and given to many members of my family and many friends who have lost loved ones."
3,Good story,"Good for a non religious but still spiritual explanation of death. The metaphor of the water bug turning into a dragonfly is lost on very young children. It would be nice if the print quality of the book were a little better, to hold a child's interest visually."
1,Water bugs and dragonflies,The book is fine. I had no idea the book would be so tiny. A friend ordered the same book and it was a normal size. That should have been stated in the description. I would have never purchased it then
1,Not the best book for explaining dying. I ended up discarding it.,There are many better books for teaching children about dying. I do not recommend this book at all. I have a curriculum for teaching children about death and this book did not meet our standards.
4,Water Bugs and Dragonflies,"Great way to explain death. I would recommend for school age children and even adults. The four year old I purchased this book for, it just went over his head. But a good book."
2,It's a COLORING book,"I was very surprised when this arrived, as it's a coloring book! By the description, I assumed it was the softback version of the original. Nowhere does it state in the description that it's a coloring book. Now that I look real close at the image of the cover on Amazon's listing page, I can barely read ""coloring book"", but I think this needs to be spelled out in the title of this book's listing."
1,Very displeased with service and product,"I am very displeased in returning the 18 paperback editions of ""Waterbugs and Dragonflies"". First of all, I thought the books would be about the same size as the hardbacks but only paperback. They were about 4 inches by 4 inches in dimension, black and white--not color. I was very disappointed in the product itself. Then I thought it was $3.99 shipping for these paperback books -- the entire order -- not individual shipping charges. When I received these itty bitty books for $1.77 each and realized I had paid $3.99 EACH for shipping, I was flabbergasted. I immediately sent them back and received credit for only 18 -- when I sent back 19 (I had ordered 20 and kept one) and was charged a restocking fee and did not receive one penny back of the $3.99 EACH shipping and handling charges. BooKnackrh and Amazon have lost me as a customer."
2,Flimsy,"It's a booklet, not a book. FYI, it has religious overtones, which is fine, but wasn't clear when I bought it."
5,A Difficult Subject Beautifully Handled,Adults as well as children will appreciate the sensitive and beautiful description of the separation that occurs at the death of a loved one. Doris Stickney's little book is not just for little people. Big people will feel comforted as well by her tale.
2,OK,"I thought this would deal more directly with death, it is just about waterbugs that swim to the surface when they are old enough and turn into dragonflys. Then they can't go visit their waterbug friends anymore. I am not a fan of the wording. I want something I can use to help my son through this time and I don't think this book is going to help much. It is too vague for a 5 year old to get, I am going to have to do a lot of explaining to make him understand how the waterbugs turning into dragonflys is like his friend dying and going to heaven."
5,great book with illustrations,"I have used this book as a reference and illustration book for classes. That was years ago, like 10 years ago, and now I was looking for it again and was unable to find it, thanks to the distributor, I was able to purchase the book and restart with my classes.Water Bugs and Dragonflies: Explaining Death to Children"
5,Paints a beautiful picture for children who have lost a loved one.,"I loved this little book. It paints a beautiful picture for children who have lost loved ones. It is basically on the premise that once they are gone, they can't come back but they will always be watching over you. The BEST I have found."
2,Explains Life After Death,"This beautiful little book does one small thing and does it well, if that's what you want. It metaphorically explains the concept of life after death, generally the way many Christians understand it. If this is what you are looking for, great, but there are many other wonderful books to help children grieve that may be much better for many families."
4,Good,I was very pleased with this book.Service was good and I received it on time.I would order again.
2,Not what I was looking for,The idea of explaining death to children can be a touch subject. We were trying to clarify and explain some questions our daughter had about the recent death of a friend of ours. This was not the book to explain death to our 10 year old. She was looking for more definitive answers to her questions.
1,sax & nothing else,well you ll never see me buying muzok instrumental stuff again thats all i have to say worthless & pointless
4,"Heavy, Baby, Heavy.","I quite disagree with my esteemed collegue when it comes to the rating. I'm tracking down the 5th level weapons, which unlike the 4th, don't look like anyone elses, and have new perks. In addition, playing the very hard mode isn't all bad, as I was THIS close to getting my main man Xiahou Yuan's 5th on tong gate. You probably need to have some sort of competence to play it though. That goes for your wingman, or second player, if ye have one. I like the questing aspect of this game. It's added quite a few features to the game, some good, some bad, but get some skill, not to mention the 4th weapons before attempting the 5th stuff, kids. The price is better than expected, considering that you have to pay [$$] for most ""revamped"" games. I don't fault the others for hating some of the new stuff, it's annoying at times. My advice, drink some tea, get a capable friend, then tackle this game. Have fun. That's the name of the game."
4,Cool but don't be fooled,"This game is very good.But there is one problem with it; IT IS NOT THE FULL GAME! If you want to get the full game DW3 first then this. Better yet, Buy DW4.I say this not a full game because you cannot play as anybody other tha Dong Zhuo,Lubu,Diao Chan,Zhu Rong, Meng Huo, Yuan Shao, and Zhang Jiao, in Musou mode.So it is very hard to train if you do not like them because you can only play with the other officers via Free Mode.(To Parents: this game is very educational, because all the names battles and conflicts are historical.)"
2,If your not good at math don't buy this book!,"Being no math whiz, I feel this book does not clearly explain how to do some of the calculation problems. I like to see how it solved step by step. Instead they just kind of show you how it's set up and the answer. I only bought it because it was required for school, otherwise I would have purchased another dosage book."
2,"Looks good, not good quality.","I was searching for the numbers that go with this set, 18/10, 18/8, etc....and saw that the Bolo servers that go with it are 18/8, so I figured the 65 piece flatware set is the same. Boy was I wrong. After seeing scratches and nicks in the pieces, I called Yamazaki headquarters and asked. Sure enough, it's 18/0. Do not want."
4,"No problems with scratches, rust spots","Heavy-weight, nicely balanced set with simple pattern that can be dressed up or down. Soup spoons are almost too large to be practical (hence the 4 stars), so we rely heavily on the tsps and are back to order more. Owned the set for 2 yrs and haven't had any problems with scratching or rust spots."
1,Awful,"After one wash in the dishwasher, the knives and forks developed rust spots. Need I say more? This is not stainless steel, this is garbage."
1,"So far, not satisfied with seller","I ordered this CD from this seller over 2 weeks ago and was informed that I would receive this order before xmas. SInce I placed the order, I have not received any replies to any of my emails to the seller regarding the status of shipment. Now, with only 6 days until xmas, they've had my money for this item for 2 weeks now and I still have no CD and no one bothers to respond to my emails. So, until I receive this item, the seller will not get more than a 1 star vote from me."
1,"Save Your Money, buy Auden's reading!",Poor reader; one of my favorite poems is 'As I Walked out One Evening' and this man mangles it beyond recognition. Just listen to the author's rendition and you will hear what the poem is really saying....just get Auden and save yourself some grief.
4,"Unless you're a long time fan, like myself, you probably already have these...","Unless you're a long time fan, like myself, and you already own all the titles released in the U.S., you don't need to get this CD. All it really is, is a neatly packaged CD created by the record label, to milk more money out of your pocket. This CD is a case in point! If you own all of 'Ryches CD's, you've already got these titles on any of the live CD's put out by the band.Bottom line is take my advice, if you can burn CD's...don't waste your dough on this CD, just burn it for yourself."
3,"It's good, but...","Susan Borowitz offers practical wisdom and humorous tales regarding her and her own friends experiences with their adolescent girls. It's witty and very inciteful. I didn't agree with some of the advice from ""parenting expert"" Ava L. Siegler, in particular when she states ""Forget teaching abstinence. It's wishful thinking and a waste of time!"". I don't agree! It's never a waste of time to try to instill morals in your child's upbringing! The book does have value regarding how mothers should be (uncool) rather than ""clueless"" or ""bestbuds"" and offers good tips and strategies in dealing with adolence."
3,excellent with one big BUT....,"I really liked this book except for one thing which echoes what a previous reviewer said. teens can and do abstain. I know quite a few of them. people in the media saying that kids cant abstain so teaching abstinance leads to a downward spiral: who wants to try and do the impossible.this aside though, this is an excellent book. I read some of the parts to my husband and we wondered if this woman has been in our home eavesdropping."
3,Avery Greeting card heavyweight card paper,I really didn't care for it as much as the Hallmark paper that I usually buy. It just didn't seem to be quite the same quality of paper.
1,Greeting Cards,"I have always been pleased with the Avery Greeting cards I've received from Amazon until this time. The cards smell as if in an old storage place and the seal on the envelopes are stuck already. I'm very displeased with this order. I needed the cards when I ordered them, or I would have sent them back. I noticed a date on the card box as 04/28/11, which is way passed when I ordered them, if that makes a difference?K"
1,Smaller is not better,"This book is small and that's about the only thing going for it. I bought this book as a neophyte dancer interested in finding out more about this new activity/sport I was trying to get into.This book is of no use to dancers or non-dancers. It is somewhat cute to look through, but serves no practical value related to improving your dancing technique, knowledge or style.Thankfully, I bought this book to supplement the class I was taking. The classes are wonderful; no medium can come compare. Dance, as I'm finding out, is less about where to place your feet and more about your entire body and the interaction you have with your partner.This book should not feel bad for itself. It has many companions at the poor book party."
3,A Society Much Different Than the U.S.A.,"I read this book based on the glowing, 5 star reviews of others. I stopped reading the book 30 pages before the end. The first half of the story held my interest well, but then it started lagging until my interest stopped altogether.Mr. Farah does have a pleasant way with words and presents the life in Somalia well indeed. I enjoyed the differences and understand the importance of superstition in their society. Also it seems that every word spoken is analyzed by each person to the extent that all sorts of unspoken psychological challenges are experienced in a chit chat conversation.For me this was not a reading joy."
3,Hmmm?,"This book is not exactly what I would call a joy. You start reading it and you just can't wait to finish it. I found the whole novel dry and uninteresting. It did have a brilliant beginning, but as time went on, you just get tired because the story itself never really develops in a way that would pique your interests at all. I can't say I'm a fan of Farah, but maybe I should try another of his books and see."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is an excellent book for that ""special man"" in your life -- whether it be a husband, brother, son, etc.!! The recipes are really so simple, which makes is much more enjoyable for men!"
1,Are you kidding?,"With a 5 star rating, I just knew that this would be a great book. What a joke!! Very disappointed and wish I had my money back!"
4,night time pants ... or better suited for daytime use???,"i found these pullups more useful for wear during the day -- my daughter SATURATES her overnight diaper and these dont hold enough (leak) -- it is great though during the day, allowing more than one accident, if i dont remind her to use the bathroom on a frequent basis -- keep in mind though that most of the kids i know tend to see the pullups as diapers -- if they are on them, they use them."
4,Like the song,"I like the song, but you might as well just buy the regular single which is much cheaper."
3,Good introduction for beginners,"Michael Baumgardt delivers a quite good introduction in designing graphical user interfaces on the web. Although he is only scratching the surface in some chapters (esp. CSS & JavaScript), the interviews with leading webdesigners make the book worth to buy."
3,light duty review spot on,It's a bit larger than expected and no compartments. Disappointed at the lack of padding but it's just an organizational case and nothing more. I would not purchase this product again.
3,A little bigger than I had intended,"This case was quite a bit bigger than what I had imagined. I have a very small camera and this case is way too big. It doesn't allow me to throw it into my purse - too bulky. Probably nothing wrong with the case itself, just wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Love is in the Earth : Kaleidoscopic Pictorial Supplement A,"Wow, yet another amazing book from Melody, a fantastic add on to her first book, I take them with me everywhere. The most complete books I've found."
4,Love from Mother Earth,My angels have guided me to this next type of healing. So many truths about healing and our connection to Mother Earth and the Universe are now a part of the mainstream. We are truly blessed!
2,not for the Novice,"I am strictly a novice .. I just like rocks. I was hoping to find a pictorial help in working with the stones .. but for me, the pictures were more of the unique formations vs the more common forms (and totally unfamiliar names) .. and it is strictly pictures. There are no property explanations in this portion of her series.So I say this is not a book for a novice .. I'm giving it to my Reiki lady, as a supplement to her copy of the Original Print of 'Love is in the Earth' with its property descriptions."
4,DYMO labels,Labels are better quality than the cheap ones we ordered and tried. They also allow us to peel them off the badges when the visitor leaves much easier than the cheap ones.
4,Dymo Address Labels,"Do their job perfectly (I'm using the Dymo TwinTurbo) without ""hanging up"" and give a very acceptable lable. Just wish they were a little cheaper."
3,"Great Product, Watch Out For the High Shipping Cost","I use a Dymo LabelWriter 300, which is fabulous, and these labels are fabulous. But be careful when ordering, as these products come from Office Depot who will gouge you with exhorbitant shipping costs - sometimes more than the labels themselves."
3,"Whoopee! look Ma, labels!",Pray hard for an aftermarket source of these highly overprices rolls...until then grit your teeth and pay the price that seems to be fixed across the board no matter where you buy these. We use thousands of these labels for mailings so the cost is getting to be a pain.
2,"OK, but could be chocolatier",This didn't have a lot of chocolate taste for the recommended serving size. Or the right amount of sweetener. I had to add a spoonful of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder and a few more drops of stevia to get my desired taste. I could have just started with that and left out the fancy product.....
1,RUN!!!!,"I got this because I love stevia, I love chocolate, it sounded wonderful. IT WAS AWFUL!!! UGH!!! I tried it like the directions said, tried mixing it with coffee, tried putting it in milk, tried adding sugar, tried it cold, hot, room temp, I just didn't want to admit it was really this bad. I really really wanted to like this. But I couldn't.Don't buy it. Seriously yuck!!!"
3,Stevita Delight Sweetner,Not thrilled with this product it doesn't have that great of a taste I was hoping for a replacement to my sugar free chocolate syrup but this isnt that greta
2,Ehh,"I was really excited about this and am am left underwhelmed. It mixed weird and has a strange taste. I have been trying to use more Stevia as opposed to the toxic, chemical artificial sweeteners. And I love the Stevita brand individual water mixes. The ""better"" Crystal Light packets. Not a huge fan of this product though."
1,Tastes Terrible,"I realize that when it comes to taste, To each his own, but I have to agree with the reviewers who say this tastes terrible. When you mix this with just plain water or milk, it tastes nothing like any chocolate or chocolate drink I've ever had. I've had pure Mexican chocolate in drinks. Perhaps it is good for mixed drinks--Cafe Mochas, flavored coffees... This doesn't beat any chocolate mix that's in the US market. I'm going back to Qwik."
5,Delicious!,I tried some stevia products after I recently went on a sugar-free diet and this was one of the products I bought. I missed having my chocolate milk so I was very glad to find this product. Now I can have a little sweetness without going off of my sugar-free diet :)
5,Great product!,"My 2 picky sugar loving boys love this chocolate stevia. I have not tasted it for myself. You do have to put a little liquid in the cup, mix it really well and then add the rest of your liquid. This is a great substitue for chocolate milk and hot chocolate without all the sugar and artifical junk in it. We mix it with rice or hemp milk since they don't drink milk. It really doesn't take as much as the package says- we use about 1/4 tsp. for 8 oz. and they are happy with that so a little container goes a long way."
3,chocolate/stevia,"Stevita Co. Inc. ~ DELIGHT ~ Cocoa with Stevia SAVE with free shipping offerThis product is ok. I was disappointed that the chocolate flavor is not very intense. It is quite sweet so if you add more power to get more chocolate flavor, it gets too sweet. It leave a grainy residue in the bottom of the drink too."
1,this tastes terrible. .,This is terrible and does not meet the expectations. I thought that I could add to water and it would give it a good taste but it was terrible. Maybe it would be better with milk but I do not drink milk.
3,Beyblade Deluxe Shooter Sliding Launcher,"I thought it could launch left and right rotations but it cant, it can rip left or right HANDED. That really ticked me off because I got it so it could launch left and right SPINNERS. Sometimes when I launched it the lock would come out so it would turn. I didnt really care for it. I recomend the spring launcher(right rotation)."
4,Duel mode launcher,It is nice because you can use it with right and left spin gears. Just switch a botton and it changes!!!!!
3,Realistic and VERY Durable,"It's not a snuggly toy like a plush and it doesn't do much but sit there. So I guess this is an educational value toy.I do want to commend the quality and realism. My daughter likes to throw and step on this poor turtle and it's lasted through a LOT of rough play. She also likes to take it into her bath. It really looks like a sea turtle in there, which makes her happy."
2,Average,"Fairly average product, not as realistic as suggested by the earlier reviewer. Looks ok, doesn't do much. Kids did not find it very exciting. Considering what other toys Amazon is selling for this price, this product does not have to be very high on one's priority list."
3,Churchquake,"Peter Wagner is perhaps today's leading proponent of the restoration to the church of the NT office of the apostle. Churchquake can be a valuable book to introduce the reader to several examples of large local churches that are seeking to be a part of this restoration movement. However, the book fails to deliver on its promise to examine this NT model, since it contains very little biblical exposition or interpretation. Wagner's background in the church growth movement of past decades is akin to that of a sociologist, who examines human behavior -- he is not a biblical scholar and is quite loose in his use of biblical material. Often he describes a current apostolic movement or church and then declares that this model represents a biblical principle - but without any discussion of the NT itself! If read alongside other books which do attempt to examine the NT model of apostolic ministry, Churchquake could be an interesting starting point for initial study."
1,Where's the Bible in this book?,"I was extremely disappointed in Wagner's latest book about new and exciting ways that God is moving in today's world. The theological holes in Wagner's beliefs become much more glaring in his presentation of present-day Apostleship. He has great and exciting stories, but he becomes less and less connected to the Word. I would take extreme precaution in applying his principles because they seem to be founded more upon a mysticism and less on Biblical example. Just be careful."
2,No Original thought,"This book had a great potential to add further insight into the New Apostolic Movement. It explains this move of God in a way, but the author lacks any original thought here. Throughout the book, the author constantly quotes statements from the books of fellow church growth book writers and adds his two cents in."
3,Freestyle Review,"It is an enjoyable CD, filled with wonderful beats and melodies. The lyrics are clean and meaningful. Lil Suzy has a nice voice as well."
1,Wrong Symphonies on Disc 1,"I work at a library, and we've owned this title (purchased from Amazon) since May 2006. It hasn't been used very often at all, but no one has mentioned this discrepancy before now. (And this has been triple checked by a patron, the librarian, myself, and my other coworkers - it's just really bizarre).Disc 1 is labeled as having the 4th and 5th symphonies, but actually contains the 1st and 2nd. When we play the disc, the music and the captions verify this.I don't know if this is one fluke disc or if there are a whole batch that have been made incorrectly, but felt this was definitely worth mentioning to potential buyers. If a patron had let us know about this sooner, we would have tried to exchange (and am sure Amazon would have obliged), but it's been almost three years now."
3,Cheap Quality,"I purchased the sofa table table along with the 3 piece table set. They came packaged well as to avoid any shipping damage. When I started to put them together I noticed that some of the veneer trim on the edges was coming off. The glass tops were not tempered glass. I can not understand how this is allowed in the U.S.A. The shelf on the bottom of the coffee table required wood dolls for the assembly, yet none came with the tables. I had to go to the store an buy them or I could not have assembled the table. These table are cheap imports. I should have bought local and looked at quality first."
1,1928 Brass-Tone Necklace,I received this necklace tangled and it took me 30 minutes to untangle it. The acutual necklace feels harsh against the skin. I know...you get what you paid for but the picture looks so different than the real necklace.
3,Does what it's supposed to do,"These labels are good.They are wide, and they do darken out anything that was previously on the old label or written on the tab.I need a better method of printing a single label though. I rarely print or require an entire sheet of labels like this, so while the product is good for project work, it's not the most efficient for ""onesy and twosy"". Otherwise, looks good and works."
1,Tru- block? Not so much!,"I was pleased to receive these as I had filing to do. I printed out a sheet of file labels, and then applied them to file folders I was re-using. I was extremely disappointed as I could see the writing right through the label, making for a very messy look. NOT recommended at all. I had to go buy new labels..."
2,More New Historicism,"If one is interested in the latest nonsense from the academy, this time dressed up in New Historicist colors, buy this book. If one is interested in either American literary realism or contract law, however, one is better off actually reading those texts and trying to understand them."
2,Fluff,"Very light weight, shallow coverage of a complex and interesting (for architectural photographers) subject. The lighting diagrams are useful but in general the book does not provide much information or insight into the practice. This is a coffee table book, sort of.If you are interested in this corner of the photography world, try to find a used copy of Norman McGrath's now out of print ""Photographing Buildings Inside and Out"". Norman is one of the grand masters of the craft and his book is the real thing, chock full of information.If you are just starting out, I recommend Eric Roth's new book ""Interior Photography: Lighting and Other Professioinal Techniques with Style"". Eric is a very successful Boston based architect/interiors photographer who writes clearly and is right on the mark about the basics of the business and the craft."
3,Not a real how to book,"This book has some good interior photos, but the how to section is very sparse.One nice idea in the book is that every photo has a lighting diagram along with it to show you how the result was achieved.Unfortunately the diagrams are not always very specific. For instance how was the scene metered, what was the type of grid used, what was the output required.In other words not a lot of exacting detail. Also it would be nice to see a before and after shot, but these are pictures by some very talented photographers that were not shot for teaching, but for clients.It has no information at all on general lighting principles, special techniques, or anything else of real value."
2,Not what I expected,"Very flimsy; BEWARE, FELLOWS is resending a NEW keyboard cover, told me AMAZON would not do tis. this cover just doesn't fit correctly, one side is too tight, the other has too much slack!"
5,great product,"I was hesitating to buy this service 'cuz I fear they don't customerize for laptops, especially mine is a newly released IBM T43p. But I was wrong. The keyboard skin just arrived and it fits perfectly! I love it and I no longer need to worry my sweat will contaminate the keyboard.The con is you have to wait for three weeks or more before you get it. I hope they can speed up the delivery"
4,"Clean Keyboard, Now and forever","I got this keyboard cover for my parent's computer, they always ate cereal infront of the computer and splashed milk on it constantly.It takes a bit of time to fill out the form to specify what type of keyboard you have, but it is completely worth it! The plastic fits right over the keys perfectly and it isn't stiff at all so the keys can be used as if it wan't there. Both of my parent's still have this product, it has been 9 months now and it still works like new!"
2,Will not buy another,"You receive a voucher and code for on-line ordering, then must order for your specific keyboard. Fit seems decent and it is supposed to conform tightly to key board so you never remove. Ours has never conformed and is like typing with pillows on the keys. Will not buy another, but may try a hair dryer to soften a bit."
1,"No Support, No Product","I bought this product almost a month ago. Received it from amazon within a couple days. Sent my specs to Fellowes for the custom keyguard thru email. No response within a week. Wrote customer service. No response again. Its now 3 weeks later, and still no response and no custom keyguard. I knew Fellowes was hit and miss with their products, but I would have at least liked to have seen the keyguard. Bleh."
2,"Good product, be prepared to wait","I always use this type of keyboard overlay and they work as promised if you take some care in applying them carefully on a clean keyboard. But if you expect it to arrive in the 7 days or that they project, think again. Mine took nearly a month."
5,great idea,"I purchased our first one close to 4 years ago. And it still is just as nice as the first day that I put it on my keyboard. We just purchased a new computer and was dissappointed that I could not find it in any of the stores in my area that their website said carried this product. My husband suggested that I check Amazon.com. Glad that I listened to him, too, saved ourselves $10.00. Great product, really! I have been telling all our friends that they need one of these skins for their keyboards. Now I can tell them where they can get a good deal, also."
4,Great,Good product and great customer service. I ordered this as a gift and accidentally threw out the order form and I sent them an email explaining the situation and they sent a new one ASAP. Very helpful and I would definitely recommend it.
1,Not for all keyboards and bad service,"I searched for a keyboard protection for my Dell 710m laptop. I chose this one because - including shipping - it was the cheapest available. I received the order form from amazon after 4 days and I submitted the order then on the fellowes website online. More than one week later I received a letter from yet another company (the actual producer of the covers), only indicating that I should contact amazon to get a refund. That was it - not even an explanation. I emailed them and they told me that they don't carry this (or other?) keyboard skin. In addition I have to spend even more time to request a refund from amazon. Good luck with your order..."
1,A really bad book,"A real big waste of money.On the cover of the book says Free Stuff, as soon as I got this book I looked inside. Most of the stuff you get cost a dollar or two, there's maybe two things out of the whole book that are free and there not even good.They shouldn't have named this book Free Stuff at all."
1,bad sound,Could've been fantastic but due to terrible sound quality it is a total bust. When John Wetton is talking to the crowd you can barely hear him talk.the music sounds like it's playing on AM radio
2,Samples sound horrible....,"I'd love to buy this album, but it seems to me like a great number of live Asia albums are nothing more than Audience recordings, or bootlegs. There is a beautiful looking Asia live 4 CD set called ""Quadra"" that I bought in London about 6 years ago, but the sound quality is like it was recorded in a bathroom. The graphics and packaging was amazing, but the quality of the sound was wretched. Am wondering about how this one would really sound as well..."
1,NOT the Japanese version,"I ordered this used and wound up with another VHS copy of the hacked American version of Varan The Unbelievable. Do NOT buy this tape. Locate and buy the REAL, unedited JAPANESE LANGUAGE version of the film. The American version is just a train wreck, totally unwatchable. The Japanese version is a very good, if obscure, monster movie."
2,never received item,"after a month of waiting, I contacted the seller and he refunded my money. I was very disappointed.Linda M"
3,Not what i thought it would have been,"I chose the play because I thought it was a Tyler Perry play and it wasn""t. I was disappointed in the fact that the saler claimed it was one of Tyler's plays and it wasn't. It's nothing that I would recommend."
1,"Just CDT and ""Un Canto,"" which I already have on SOGNO","This CD is the first release under the title ""Canto Della Terra,"" and it contains just the Radio Edit of CDT and the selection ""Un Canto,"" both of which I already have on my Sogno CD. Very upsetting! I once saw that TWO releases under this title were available here as Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 and was tricked into believing that they were dance remix concept singles, but guess what: neither of them were. Don't waste your money on this single unless you're a die-hard Andrea Bocelli fan, you're better off looking for the Extended 4-track CDT single if you can help it. E-mail me at RockTheDragonDBZ@aol.com if you'd like to know anything about it."
1,Poor performance,The labels do not work well with the printer and come unstuck in the printer works. I would not buy again.
1,a dud...,"This toy ended up being a dud! We had to send it back because we never could get the on/off switch to stay on. When it did stay on, the game was not as fun as it seemed it would be in the picture. I have 2 sons, ages 4 & 8 and neither liked it at all. Not sturdy and not good quality."
2,Too Fast,"Concept of this cd is good, learn basic Thai in a short length of time. Plus its the only Thai language tutorial that I know of thats on cd. The problem is that the Thai words and phrases are pronounced ridiculously fast for a beginner to comprehend. I've run this by 3 of my friends and they all felt that it was humorous to be expected to be able to imitate the pronunciations, many words were said so rapidly that none of my friends could begin to repeat them . The words should be said slowly once, then speeded up to the rate that native Thais speak. The small book is helpful, but to have to continually follow it while listening to the cd somewhat defeats the purpose of the cd. More repetition would also be most welcome. It seemed as though the authors never ran this by someone who had never spoken Thai."
2,Too fast but no other options on CD,Way too Fast. Really hard to understand the language with this CD. Even hard for me to tell expresions I already know.
5,Overnight help...,I read this book on an overnight flight from San Francisco to Singapore -- on my way to an assignment that had stumped my company for a while. New Asian Emperors helped me and my company score a winning agreement by helping us finally understand where our Asian partners are coming from. It should help us weather any future storms together. Need I say more?!
5,A balanced and insightful account of Chinese businesses,"These experts have presented an authoritative, fair and upbeat picture of the Nanyang or Overseas Chinese -- covering complex areas such as their philosophy, ethics and day-to-day business workings. Their probing, almost intimate, accounts of how top Chinese managers of Asian companies make decisions is outstanding. This is a must-read book for any one with Asian connections -- not least because it is well written."
1,superficial,"This book shows little depth - it's too flimsy. A better but more dated account is 'Overseas Chinese Business Networks in Asia', published in 1995. The 'Encyclopedia of Chinese Overseas' is also good and there is a good chapter on the overseas Chinese in 'Asian Eclipse' by Michael Backman."
4,excellent music,"I really loved the music on this cd, my favorite ""I could not ask for more"". It's a great song which makes me realize just how lucky I am. The rest of the cd is terrific as well."
4,"Edwin embraces ballet tunes, but still good.","Obviously Edwin was lead down ballet road with this album. The first track rocks out, which truly defines this superb vocalist's style symbolic of his earlier days. The rest of the album plays to his recent success with I'll Be which unfortunately made another appearance on this album. ""My life is in the storm"" and others from the pre-major-label days are the true hits that deserve national attention and recognition. Edwin McCain was and still is a very moving and inspiring musician with a great band. He just needs to get back to his roots. Still, a good album that was likely too determined by his record label, pushed through too quickly, and not exactly what Edwin was looking for. I am already looking forward to the next Edwin album because he's just soo talented."
5,"Go Be Young, go be free!","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD. I bought it because I was a big Dawson's Creek fan and owned Misguided Roses, because of my great love for the sappy ""I'll Be."" So that's two Edwin McCain songs now that have been ""our song"" with different people. Anyways, I listen to this one as I fall asleep. I am inspired by ""Go Be Young,"" touched by ""Could Not Ask for More,"" and uplifted by ""Do Your Thing""...Edwin McCain will go further!"
4,Pretty Good,"Although the CD drags in some places, and even though ""I Could Not Ask For More"" is pretty but cheezy, i like this CD. ""Go Be Young"" ""Prayer to Saint Peter"" and of course ""I'll Be"" are among the best. Edwin may have not outdone ""Misguided Roses"" but the CD still is very enjoyable. I like it alot."
5,Excellent,"First of all, this is an excellent CD. I never get tired of the songs. For those of you who like the song ""Prayer to St. Peter."" YOu should know that this was originally done by John Gorka (who based it on a poem he found), and then remade by David Wilcox. Wilcox's version is by far the best."
3,Edwin's fans will not be disappointed.,"Listened to the demo last night. I am an Edwin fan, but objecitvely I think the CD has a good mix of uplifting jams and heartbreaking ballads. New singles ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Go be Young"" are awesome. I also liked ""I could not ask for More"" that has already hit the radio waves, the lyrics sound like something he would write - although I've been told it's not his song and he is not as passionate about it as he is other tracks that are his creation. Re-released versions of ""I'll Be"" (acoustic!) and ""Sign on th e Door"" (upbeat version) are very cool. Die hard fans will be so excited to have ""Prayer to St. Peter"" on CD, again not his lyrics - but what a beautiful song. We love you Edwin!"
4,Fantastic!,"I loved this CD from start to finish. I bought it for ""And I Could Not Ask For More"" and enjoyed every track on it. I love to listen to it on long trips in the car, you don't have to flip through the tracks for the ""good ones"", but can listen to the whole thing and enjoy it all. He's got such emotion in his voice. You'll love it!"
4,Very Good!,"The product that I recieved had a little water damage to the package, but it sounds great!"
4,Good sexy vampire genre movie.,"Vampire movies should be sexy. Too often they offer violence and bloody scares and ignore the heritage of Dracula and the classics of this genre which first and foremost were seductive and threatening. This video puts the heroine in harms way but definitely with a lesbian seduction connotation. You aren't sure what the leader of this coven of female vampires want with her soul but it's pretty clear what they have in mind for her body. The use of dream sequences and internet web sites brings both the danger and the irresistible attraction of these undead quite apparent. David Carradine does a good job as the modern day but anachronistic Van Helsing but the female leads are who make this movie good sexy horror. Both are very good looking and play their respective parts as pursuer and innocent very well. Beautifullyl filmed, especially the dream sequences. A good notch above the usual for this kind of film."
3,It certainly sucks,"Sydney (Natalie Brown) is a writer doing a story on a dating website called Artemis. Artemis is very female-friendly, catering to the needs of women. It's also a haven for vampires. David Carradine plays a vampire hunter (Abraham Van Helsing ""Jr."" I suppose), seemingly in a completely separate movie for the bulk of the film. He jams on the flute. He gets an old guy with giant nerd glasses to do the heavy lifting in terms of destroying this vampire sect. Am I really supposed to believe the guy is a badass? The Last Sect is one slow story, but I stuck with it till the end, so I guess I can't say it wasn't a little intriguing. The soundtrack was provided by the poor man's Elastica (""The Duke Spirit""). Distracting."
5,Unique and Inspired,"This is a shining star in a morass of poorly written Magic the Gathering books. It is unique in that the author is the main protagonist and it gives you insight into how a professional Magic player evaluates cards and comes up with decks. This isn't a ""how to"" book its more of a ""how I did it"" book."
3,I Understand the Pain,"I enjoyed the story but it just didn't take me anywhere. My question through out the book was - And??? Oh well, I guess we all have a family member that we think negatively about, but..."
5,Label printer paper,This was the proper paper for our label printer at work. Good Quality and works fine with this printer and we are very please with the product.
5,Dymo Shipping Labels,Use this product all the time. Great value. Product delivered timely and in good order. Thank you.
1,TERRIBLE!,"This product is NOT original, not for and sort of label printer. The labels do not have the markers on the back so the label writer can judge where it is. The labels had brown glue strung of the surface of the labels (even the labels that where closer to the middle.NOT HAPPY not convinced my money will be refunded, UNTRUSTWORTHY DO NOT BUY FROM!"
4,Labels great... Packaging not so much....,I was concerned as the packaging looked like it had been made in the 80's and stored and handled since then. The labels inside we're still good and I was able to use them.
3,Love Dymo Labels!,"While I love DYMO's printing of labels, I really despise their white labels. A little bit of sun and heat and the thermal paper blacks out.Now, their clear labels are a whole other story...I love them!! These allow a more professional look on envelopes, packages, and return mailer cards.Buy the clear labels - you will fall in love with how quick and easy they are to use."
5,"Works well, nice and bright","I've bought a lot of labels over the years, and I find that the original Dymo brand labels are always the nicest/brightest/whitest. If you want nice bright/white labels, this is the best option in my opinion."
5,Training,"The book was quite helpful with thorough explanations and insights into the developmental stages of the dog. In addition, the book provided reasons why people and pets act/react to situations. Bravo!"
3,The Only Dog Training Book You'll Ever Need,I was disappointed in this book. The book was mainly about clicker training which is not a method I use in training my dogs. Some of the information in the book was useful but there are other dog training books that I like better.
3,Good reference material,"Covers many of the standard training techniques with tried and true methods that work, so if you are at wits end, try this one!"
3,book,"The book is in good condition and is exactly how it was described. The shipping did take what seemed like a long time, however there were no issues and overall, it was a smooth business transaction.The only issue I have is that the box the book came in looked like somebody had played kickball with it, literally. The box was super smashed and more resembled a crumpled piece of paper than a box. I cannot think of why the sender would have done this to the box (or why they would have shipped it in such a beaten box), so I am guessing this is probably a result of the shipping company. It was really irritating though.The book was in good condition though and I did not have any problems with the seller."
4,The Only Dog Training Book You'll Ever Need,Love the book. Price was awesome. Shipping was timely. Will definately make more purchases in the future.
1,Beware HDMI switching,"Bought this receiver from Best Buy for $499. Hooked up a Samsung HD860 upconvert DVD player and a new DirecTV HD20-700 to the HDMI ports. The DVD player would start play for a few minutes then disconnect and try to reconnect continuously. Sat box worked fine until you changed the input to something else then it would not reconnect. Most frustrating part was to get it all working again, all the power cords and HDMI cables had to be unplugged. Doing one or the other would not work. Receiver would also shut itself off after a few minutes of playing at moderately high volume. Not sure what the problem was. Wiring all checked out ok. Not a good experience but at least Best Buy took it back with no problem. I'm going with the RX-V659 and forego the HDMI switching."
3,Should have looked at more!,"Easy to connect everything especially using the HDMI outputs. Very good sound with 7 speakers (using Bose for all but the 2 rear which I installed Niles in wall flush mount. Biggest disappointment is not being able to use my Sony universal remote. The Yamaha won't turn off with anything other than its own remote, which by the way, is very weak. Overall, satisfied but there are better units out there for the same price."
4,"Nice reciever, but complex","Very nice receiver, but the operation of it requires almost a degree in engineering (which I have, but still had to study the manual - which of course engineers don't like to do). The sound is great and it has more features than you can imagine once you figure them out."
4,Good sound/video. Bad remote control.,"I've been using this receiver for about a week now. The auto-setup was great! The auto-setup even noticed that I accidentally reversed the wires for one of my speakers. I haven't seen this very helpful feature in other receivers.It has the video and audio performance that you would expect for this price range.I have one complaint about this receiver. When using the remote control, you need one button to turn it on, and it requires a different button to turn it off. Tech support said that was how the buttons are suppose to work. This is an issue if you ever plan to use it with good universal remote control. The provided remote control is hard to navigate in the dark when you may be navigating the remote control by touch in the dark. At the moment, my universal remote control can only power it off, and I have to manually turn it on."
2,Shady seller,"Immediately after ordering this product via Amazon, I became suspicious that the product was not ""new"" as represented. I contacted the seller and asked if this was new stock, and not ""B stock"". I was assured the product was brand new and was not ""B stock"".The receiver arrived. There was no bill of sale (so how to return easily?) and the Yamaha warranty card included clearly states ""B Stock"" and a restricted warranty applies. In addition, there is a sticker on the rear of the receiver clearly stating ""B Stock"".The seller misrepresented the product. I am not happy and advise readers to avoid this seller."
3,Too much technology,"After my Yamaha RX-V690 died, I purchased the RX-V661 primarily for relative A/V capability with HDMI. After using the ""new and improved"" V661, I wish I could have a V690 with HDMI because it is more user friendly, preferred bass/treble control. Also, the V661 speaker volume control is not balanced, where the primary front or A speakers are considerably louder than the B speakers in another room. Disappointed, BUT I ONLY HAD 14 DAYS TO RETURN!!! %%$% I'll be spending higher prices in more customer friendly retail stores than looking to save on online shops that offer money-saving DEALS(?)."
4,Works Great,"I use this receiver with my Bose Acoustimass home theater system and it sounds great. I'm sure there are some features which I have yet to learn to use, but for what I'm using it for, its great.Pros:-strong sound output (this thing can crank)-easy to use (remove is intuitive)-was not overly expensive-has HDMI connectionsCons:-physically larger than I imagined-setting up speaker wire was tough, but I think thats with any receiver of this caliberI wish my TV and/or cable box had additional HDMI capabilities, but they dont. This receiver has 2-3 HDMI outputs which is great for growth, but for now i dont use them all...overall - recommended as a good, simple, but high quailty receiver to get at a good price. i looked at a bunch of other 7.1 systems and they were really much more expensive"
5,Every Bit As Good As Volume 1,"It seems like only yesterday that I was raving about Rich Conaty's compilation on Rivermont BSW 1141, and Volume 2 is every bit as good. In his introduction to the exemplary 16-page liner note Rich highlights the Connie Boswell, Al Bowlly, and Annette Hanshaw tracks as being issued on CD for the first time, and there are plenty more which, as he puts it, ""have fallen between the reissue cracks"". With over 30 years' experience of hosting his weekly radio program on WFUV-FM in New York City, he is a connoisseur of this era, and the result is a fascinating mixture of hot and sweet which demonstrates that jazz and popular music were not mutually exclusive domains. Many of the original 78 recordings are considerable rarities, to purchase any one of which would set you back a great deal more than the cost of this CD. I cannot recommend it too highly, and am looking forward already to Volume 3."
5,"Big Broadcast, Big sound","Really enjoyed this compilation. Excellent music right from the first track by Eva Taylor. The liner notes included are read worthy. As someone who enjoys music from the 20's and 30's, I can't recommend this album enough.All the Big Broadcast compilations are unique in their own way but they just take you to a magical place that's worth going to often."
5,Simple and cute,I disagree with the first reviewer. These shoes are even better IRL! They are simple and go perfectly with summer skirts and dresses
1,"PIAA 94548 Graphite Wiper Blade Refill, 19"" (Pack of 1)",this was not what I expected. It was the rubber for the blades and nothing other. Multiple attempts to use these were frustrating at best and would not work. Returned them for refund. Don't even bother
3,Comfortable but not durable,I bought these socks for work in the hopes that they would be more durable for the higher price however they got a hole in the seem by the toe after only 5 or so washings. They were comfortable and provided excellent shock absorption I just wish they had held up a little longer than that!
5,streams cd is deep and soothing.,"i read the devotional ""streams in the desert"" daily, and as the stories and prayers inspire and comfort me, this beautiful music cd in a very powerful way soothes my heart. i have enjoyed it so much, that i have purchased several for my other friends who also read ""streams"". i would highly recommend it."
4,Nice splitting wedge,Quality appears acceptable but quality of material is unknown at this time. Mine was made in India the one advertized in the close-up says made in china. What's the difference anyway. Seams we could make it here for less and not have to pay to ship that four pound thing around the world. What a shame ...
4,Good Pedometer,We've been pleased with this Pedometer. It tracks things several different ways. The safety clip prevents loss when the Pedometer comes off your waistband.
4,Pedometer Review,"I really love the pedometer. I like that it has the time on it, I seldom wear a watch when I workout, so it has been really nice. It seems to be very accurate. I like the ability to review what I have done in the past week. It's only flaw is it is a little top heavy and does come unclipped easily as you bend and move around. The safety strap has really kept me from losing it on more than one occasion. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone."
4,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,This pedometer is the greatest little tool to motivate you to move. It is so accurate. The clip could be better. I would have lost it several times if not for the second clip I put on it.
4,Great pedometer and very convenient,"I've been using my Omron HJ-112 pedometer now for several months. What is wonderful about this product is that you can just slip it in your pants pocket. I do this and then use the clip to make sure it doesn't fall out. Using the watch pocket on jeans works great, too. I've done a number of calculations and this pedometer is very very accurate. The only downside is I wish it kept track of minutes. It does not do that for you. I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed."
3,Solid little product - gets the job done.,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life? I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONA nice little addition to any obsessive self-trackers out there. Cheap and easy to use.FUNCTIONALITYThe interface is pretty 1990s, but it gets the job done. All I really hired this product to do was tell me how far I walk each day, so I can factor that in against my workouts, in terms of identifying fatigue factors. It's not so bulky as to be annoying in your pocket. I use it without the lanyard.VALUESeems like it should come in around the $12 mark, so I knocked it a star.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?It helps me get a little more data so that I have a little better picture of my daily activities. I would LOVE to have this integrated into a wifi-capable product that tracks and uploads and lets me export to CSV."
5,Great Motivator!,"I originally got this pedometer for my sister in law for Christmas. Then after the first of the year, my dad asked me to get one for my mom and I ended up getting one for myself too. I LOVE IT!It keeps track of aerobic steps and mileage as well as calories burned. But the best part is that it keeps a record for 7 days! It is a great motivator for me to see how many steps I take and it is a great visual to see that I need to be more active some days!I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their health or maintain their healthy lifestyle."
5,Superb instrument and superb value,"This is the one to buy. It works like a bandit and should meet any walker's needs. It measures steps, aerobic steps, mileage and calories burned. It also has a clock. It clips to your belt or can be carried in your pocket. It is easy to set and recycles each night, so you don't have to reset it for your morning walk. The price is reasonable and the quality high. I'm glad that I bought this one."
1,Having little success with this,"I'm very frustrated with the Omron. I wear a pedometer because I may walk a max of 5000 steps a day. (Learning to live with chronic illness.) The clip pops off constantly, which makes it annoying if I wear it at my waist. My doc wants me to wear it at my waist, directly beneath my armpit. I don't find that having it in my pocket is the least bit accurate. I've worn my old ""tic-toc"" mechanical pedometer at the same time as the Omron, and the tic-toc's readings seem far more accurate to me. (I've given up the tic-toc because it's worn out and resets itself too often.) My physical therapist recommended something more substantial. I've read and reread the Omron instructions, and my only surmise is that my step isn't ""vigorous"" enough to register. Beats me. I picked it out because of all of the rave reviews, but now I'm wondering if anyone with compromised health is having any luck with it."
5,really convenient and accurate ...,"can be carried in your pocket as well as on your waistband - only ""problem"" is I forgot to remove it at the beach (got wet, needed a new one), then I dropped it on a tile floor (broke the display) ... wish it were water-proof and could take dropping!"
3,Inadequate belt clip,"The pedometer works well, but my husband has lost three when they have become dislodged from his belt in various situations (e.g., sitting in the back seat of a car)."
1,Missing Battery,"What a disappointment!! The battery (cr2032) was not included in the package. It is listed as a component but was not there. Is this a way of keeping the price low, by not including components readily available at the local store and cheap enough so as to encourage consumers to not return the Omron pedometer. So - should I spend 10$ on return postage or quit buying Omron products and tell everyone I know about the missing component?"
1,Missing items,I don't know if this is a good product or not. It says the package includes the battery (which is an unusual one) and a small screwdriver. They were not included so I can't use it until I go find the stupid battery. This is really unacceptable.
3,Not Ready For Prime Time,"I just don't know what to think about all these great reviews and the Consumer Reports rating as I have this pedometer and it certainly is nothing special. I have checked this unit against mileage from walking and on a treadmill and it's not really accurate. It's not good for a pedometer to just plain drop steps, (and I counted). Also, the ""calories used"" feature is suspect when the unit has no programming as to the incline of the roads or trails.The only reason I didn't send this thing back is that I can manually adjust for the unit's deficiencies by adding 20 to 25% to the totals or by programming the unit to make my strides 20 to 25% shorter and get ball park data. I certainly hope that this unit remains deficient at a certain percentage.I definitely recommend that users go to ""internet calorie counters"" to get more useful information about weight loss from walking and adjust accordingly."
4,Decent,"The HJ-112 is a reasonable size, and easy to carry. The counter seems very accurate, which is the most important part. It is, however, a bit too sensitive at times. When I sit, it often keeps counting, because of my sifting in the seat. I also wish there was a total counter. It counts per day, for several days, then starts over. You probably have to record the numbers yourself."
5,Best pedometer I've used,"This is a great pedometer! And the reasonable price makes it even better. I've been walking for exercise for many, many years and have never been able to find a pedometer that is this accurate for me, without paying a huge price. It's because this one doesn't have to be clipped to your waistband. You can clip it to a pocket, fannypack, even your sports bra! As long as it's not parallel to the ground, it works well. Highly recommmended."
5,Great purchase,I bought the item online - received it within a couple of days. Its very easy to set up and use. Slim and light so fits in my trouser pocket at work or at the gym. It motivates me to get up and walk around so I can get the numbers higher. Highly recommend it.
5,Amazing Pedometer,I like this pedometer very much. It was very easy to set up. I like the way it tracks a different variety of things not just steps. It resets itself every day giving you a total for that day - it also has memory setting. Overall it is a great pedometer at a low price for all you get with it.
3,Does the job very well,"Does the job well. Easy to set up and use. However, with the clip, it's extremely bulky. I was hoping that it'd be thinner and more discreet."
2,Counts WAY too many steps,"When I first tried the Omron, and went for a walk that I know to be 1.6 miles, it registered it as 2.91 miles. The next day, walking the same course, it registered 2.75 miles. FAR over what I actually walked. The number of steps seemed way too high as well. That's when I realized that it over-states the number of steps dramatically when worn in the front pocket of my shorts. Its a fair bit more accurate when clipped to the belt, but that's not why I bought this one. I bought it specifically to just put in my front pocket and forget about it until the end of the day. Some of the discrepancies I've noticed included it saying I'd walked a hundred steps while driving my car. The 20 yard walk to my bosses office is apparently 112 steps according to Omron. It makes the item virtually useless unless its attached to the belt. And with the cheap belt clip it comes with, this isn't that helpful."
4,I like this pedometer,"The pedometer seems to work great. I wish it were a little smaller, but other than that I'm pleased with it."
4,great walking motivator,"We each bot one of these, get a kick out of wearing them around, watching the mileage add up. They appear to be very accurate, and the memory feature is nice [it holds the last 7 days worth of steps, miles and calories]. It would be nice, tho, if you could reset the counter to zero for a 2nd or 3rd walk without losing the numbers for a 1st walk; to be able to view 2 or more walks separately but accumulate all their distance numbers. But anyway -- it's a very good pedometer [and we've had some mechanical pedos that were wildly off the marks], and they do encourage us to walk more often and farther. They will go with us on all of our travels from now on."
2,Didn't last long term,"I bought this product awhile back, and it was fine. But now, it eats through batteries every 2 days. And once the battery is low, even though the screen is still on and functioning, it will not count the steps until I replace the battery.The cheap one's you buy at discount stores last longer. Not impressed with what I spent on it that it didn't continue to function properly."
1,"Missing battery, zero service","I ordered the pedometer from Amazon and it arrived in a sealed plastic container. When opened, it had no battery. The battery is listed on the box as included. The video says it is easy to get started because the battery is included. I sent an email to Omron and got a prompt reply the next day. They said they include the batter when it is shipped. I seriously doubt somebody at Amazon is cutting the container open and stealing the batter, then magically resealing the container.It was frustrating to have it arrive without a battery, but even worse to have them tell me this was not their problem.I've not had the pedometer long enough to evaluate its performance but I did pay $4.29 for the battery."
2,Pedometer,"I'm not really sure I should have purchased the pedometer for what I tried to do. I was doing mountain hiking I couldn't get it where it was accurate. Hiking on a mountain trail is much different than walking down the street as your steps are not equal. I was going on hike to the top of a 14,000+ peak & wanted to check my progress. It was way off & I gave up on it. I had made adjustments to it prior to the hike trying to make it accurate. If I had the packaging I may have returned it but I don't so its mine."
3,Works well most of the time,Before the Omron I had another pedometer which was wildly inaccurate. The Omron is fairly easy to set up though the directions can be confusing; as long as one is walking on a hard surface it is accurate. But on a padded carpet it cannot be counted on to record steps accurately.
1,Missing item,"Battery wasnt included in this package and it says in the manual that it comes with it, now i have to go shopping for the special watch battery"
3,Where's the battery?,I bought this after reading great reviews and because it was supposed to come ready to go. Wrong. No battery included so now I have to go buy one before I can try it out.
2,"Ok for walking, not good for a runner","I bought this item when I first got back into running to help keep up with how far I was going. I have used it both outside and on a treadmill. It only has one setting for stride. My stride is different for a leisurely stroll, walking for exercise and jogging or running. I wore my pedometer on the treadmill. It was accurate for the leisurely stroll. It was off by 1/2 mile for vigorous walking. It was off over a mile when I jogged 3 miles. It even misses steps. Several days in a row, I ran on the treadmill, the same speed, the same distance, and the same time. The step counter read vastly different several days in a row. Needless to say, I have been dissappointed and am looking for a new product. Any suggestions?"
5,Omron Hj Digital Pedometer,"Best ever. I have never had a pedometer with that degree of precision.Best regards,William"
5,I really like this.,This works really good & it won't register steps if you just shake it Or just walk in place. You have to Really Take Steps.
3,Buy extras if you buy....,"It was a good pedometer, but the belt clip and security strap were useless. The whole thing fell off my hip and was lost forever within a week of the purchase. Bummer."
5,"Accurate, convenient, comfortable!","I love this pedometer! I'm particularly happy with it's accuracy, since I have tested it in a number of control situations and am quite pleased with the versatility of it (i.e. the ability to carry it in my purse and it still works properly, the clip so I can clip it on my clothes when I don't have a readily available waistband, and the waistband clip/holder thing). I love that it has a memory feature- I just wish I could look up more information than just how many steps I took (but then again, it may be that I need to go over the instructions again). I like how it feels in my hand, the material is nice, and it's just a great thing to have in general if you are trying to lose weight or are on an exercise regime where you need to track your steps. I'm glad I bought this model and not a cheaper one. I would definitely recommend this model to friends/family."
4,Kind of Pricy But works Well,"We needed this for a class I was doing where we need to log 10-12000 steps per day. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Although, I do think it's a little pricy considering other alternatives out there.It seems to lag a bit on walking in place which is why only 4 stars. Sometimes it doesn't read those steps and I wonder if it has something to do with the way I have it set up rather than the way the pedometer actually works.All in all I think it's a great tool, and it works well. I do think there are cheaper options that would work just as good however."
5,Fine Little Pedometer,"I have had several pedometers of various makes. This little Omron pedometer beats them all. Compact; accurate, once you set your proper stride; most important modes of display; clips on belt, pocket, etc.; helps to urge you to get out and walk. Also, resets itself at 12:00, but stores display data for several days. Highly recommended. Have had good results generally from Omron products and other items purchased from Amazon."
3,Missing Battery,"Unlike other pedometers I've tried, this one is easy to set and works well. My only complaint is that it was supposed to come with a battery and did not. Batteries can be expensive and when I contacted the company they said to contact the retailer. A lot of effort to try to get something that was supposed to be included."
3,Great product (for US),"I've owned a few of these over the years (having managed to lose a couple) and I really like them - simple and they ""just work"". However, this model, unlike earlier ones, forces me to work in miles and inches, which for a Kiwi in NZ takes some getting used to ;0)"
4,"Great Device, BUT...","Great device, works well, easy to program and use. BUT, belt clip is not well designed and it's easy for the unit to fall off. Must use the safety line and clip to keep the device attached."
2,Product quality is poor,"The quality is poor, as it's never off, though the manual indicates it'll be off after 5 minutes."
2,difficult to set up,Have had a very difficult time setting it up so have never used it accurately or for any extended time.
1,Don't recommend,"I have used this product more than 2 months by now. Before I bought this, I had read reviews to make a right choice. It looked me that this one would be a good choice. However, it didn't turn out as I expected. I run same course every day, but the calculation of steps and miles by this product varies every day. If deviation is around 5%, I would not complain. But, it is far worse than acceptable. For example, one round of my routine course should be about 4 miles. However, the calculation of this product fluctuates b/w 3 miles to 4.8 miles. Bottom line is if you want to have this kind of product for the peace of mind, then avoid this one and buy less expensive one. It is not worth at all."
1,Omron Pedometer,"The pedometer itself is pretty good.... however, mine did not come with a battery. The instruction manual said that a battery was included. Since it was a weekend, I went out and bought a battery for $3.99. On Monday I called customer service at Omron and informed them of my missing battery. They said I had to return the unit to them for them to install a battery and ship it back to me. I told them I had already bought the battery and I wanted a credit or another battery to use when the current one expires. They said, ""Sorry, you have to return the whole unit."" I told them that was the dumbest thing I ever heard.... spent $5 to ship and be without the unit for at least a week. ""Sorry, you have to return the whole unit."" The next day I called back and asked to speak to a manager... got the same story, except they would send me a pre-paid mailer. NO THANKS! I may never see the unit again the way this company operates."
2,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer Review,"The Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer is okay but it's way to bulky which is a big problem if you are veryinto your sport or just plain old exercise. In terms of doing what it has to do it is great. I did find one glitch (ifyou will) though. When entering your height, it only lets you get to four feet as apposed to say five foot one orfour foot three. So in conclusion, I'd say that the item should get two stars until the glitch gets fixed and fourafterwords."
2,missing batteryt,Pedometer came with no battery although box said battery included. Price dropped $10 days after I ordered it and I could do nothing about that.
3,Not bad,"Seems fairly accurate, however, one thing about it drives me crazy. It resets itself at midnight every night! So if i look at it at 11:55 pm and it has 8000 steps, at 12:01 am it will have zeroed out and shows 0 steps. I am a student with late hours so I still am active way past midnight, so this is very inconvenient."
5,Great Buy,"This is a hardy pedometer that does its job. I drop it all the time, but it keeps working! It has lots of great features."
4,Omron Hj-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer,"This is probably one of the best pedometers I have bought. The digital figures are easy for me to read. Can be carried in my pocket and attached to the pocket instead of my waistband. The past pedometers I have had to put on my waistband, thus they were lost easily in various places. I am hoping this is the last pedometer I have to buy for quite some time."
5,Great Investment and Motivator!!!,I purchased one of these pedometers and loved it - I bought 5 more and gave them as gifts - easy to use and easy to read - you can't go wrong with this purchase.
5,Comprehensive,"This is a very comprehensive pedometer. It notes things that I hadn't even thought of. The fact that it can be carried in a pocket or purse enhances the product, helping you to stick to your goals. I would recommend it for anyone who is serious about their health."
3,HJ-112 no longer has a reset button,"I had an Omron pedometer which counted steps more accurately than any other pedometer I have owned. Its display died so I bought a new one. Unfortunately the current model no longer has a reset button. The distance walked only resets to zero at the end of the day, so you can not measure the length of a specific walk. I find it very disturbing that a company would greatly diminish the usefulness of a great product just to save the cost of one button."
4,Just what My Wife Needed,I recieved the 2 items in good condition and right away my wife started to read the directions on how to us this.She was happy and so was my daughter(who happened to get the other one)
4,great little pedometer,I like this pedometer very much. The only thing I wish it could do is calculate the difference in calories burned from walking a regular pace and aerobic walking. Maybe that just isn't possible.
3,good for walking...not so good for running,"I bought this for running... not so good....I read some reviews that seemed positive, so instead of getting a GPS, i wanted to try this out..it works great for walking, but for running....nope...had to sell, and buy a GPS to track my running distance.."
3,"Ok but had 2 and ""dies"" after about 6 months.","I was looking for a basic pedometer that would last me more than a few months, be accurate and easy to use and I thought I found it with this one. And it worked GREAT for the first 6 months. I loved the aerobic setting, the 7 day recall, etc. After about 6 months it seemed to stop counting correctly and would just ""die"" even after I changed the battery twice in it. It then would die and come back, only the time would be off like it completely shut itself off. I decided to buy another one since I loved it so much, but after 6 months it did it again. I'm not sure even on sale as I see Amazon has it if it is worth paying that amount for something that will only last 6 months. I may try a different Omron to see if it does the same thing. Otherwise the best I've ever used!! Too bad can't find these in stores. I have to order them."
5,great pedometer!,I love this pedometer and have taken to giving it as a gift to family and friends.My only issue is that the ad (and packaging) says it comes with the battery and 2 of the 4 I have bought does not include it (about $4. at the drugstore).
4,pleased with my omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer,What I like most about this pedometer is that it is sensitive to my steps and does not have to be located directly over my leg. I like putting it in my pocket and it counts my steps very accurately. I also like the 7 day memory so I can see how I am progressing each week. The instructions were easy to follow. Very good product.
4,from a pedometer-aholic,"I am an avid walker and have been using a pedometer as incentive off an on for about 6 years. I've purchased at least 10 different kinds of pedometers and I really like this one. It doesn't re-set itself, the memory feature is great and I love that it calculates aerobic activity. Some pedomters give you steps when you wiggle. I don't want to be fooled into thinking I've walked 10,000 steps (Heart & Stroke Foundation's reccomendation). This one is honest! I've also never had it fall off - ever. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's bigger than most pedometers."
4,This is a great Pedometer,"This pedometer is perfect for what I needed. It allows me to customize it to my stride and counts my aerobic steps vs. regular steps, distance, and calories. It is incredible. The only issue I have with it is that it only works if it is in my pocket or in certain bags/purses, so if I have a don't have a pocket and just want to clip it on the inside of my pants, it does not count my steps correctly. That being said, it is still the best pedometer I've ever had."
3,Bulky but neat features,"Bottom line: I use this pedometer because it is accurate and motivates me.Biggest Pro: Resets each day and you can review 7 days of walking.Biggest Con: Bulky so shows more than others and pops off my waist band sometimes when I sit down, but the string safety attachment keeps it from being lost."
5,great pedometer,"i purchased this pedometer a couple of months ago and just love it. very easy to set up, i clip it on in the morning and off i go. it tells you everything you need to know. i love to see how many miles i walk in a day. you will be surprised to see how fast it adds up. i have tried others but this one is by far the easiest to operate."
5,Nice Pedometer,"I had a different pedometer at first and it was not accurate at all! I decided to invest in something better and this one had good reviews, so I got it. It is great! Usually I clip it to my waistband, but sometimes I put it in a pocket and either way it works great!"
2,good unit but,"it keep falling out of the belt holder and onto the ground. three plastic ""grabbers"" hold the unit to the holder. it fell off and i didnt even realize it. fortunately it was in my driveway. the device is accurate, but id pass it up due to this drawback"
4,Good product does what it says,"Pedometer arrived without the battery. The alleged screwdriver is just better than useless. You might want to use your own. This pedometer was rated the best for what it does on ask.com. It is a better product than two I have previously owned. It is easy to read. Device seems pretty accurate, though I have not stepped it off over a known distance to check. I know my stride is 30"" so I really have not bothered to recalibrate.I've put over 400,000 steps on it in just under a month and find it to be a great motivator.I only regret it does not keep dogs away."
5,I Really Love and Use this Pedometer,"I bought this for myself in January, and have worn it every single day since I put it on the first time. I don't know about EXACT measurements, but it certainly gives me a goal each day of 10,000 steps, it keeps a record, and has been very dependable. The strap is essential. The little clip on the strap broke, so now I use a safety pin to attach the strap to my waist band. I would have lost this pedometer a long, long time ago without this extra strap and clip. I just love the different modes, and the way it keeps 7 days history. I cannot say enough good things about this pedometer. I am going to give it to my children for Christmas, and have given it to friends as a birthday gift."
5,Premium Pedometer,"I've been wearing a pedometer everyday for the past three+ years. Of the several brands I've tried, the OMRON is superior for accurate counting. Interestingly, my husband found my last one that a walker/jogger had lost. I wore it for two year before I lost it in a tub of water which I had been bending over. Thirty minutes later I discovered the soggy pedometer, removed the battery and let it dry thoroughly. It continued to work but some of the LED segments were damaged so I decided to replace it. I was delighted to find my new OMRON came with a safety strap which means I'll never need to replace this one! Great product."
5,Great Pedometer,"My husband and I each have an Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer. In addition to counting steps, it tells how many steps and minutes were Aerobic steps! You have to walk faster than 60 steps/minute for at least 10 minutes before it records Aerobic steps. This is real motivation and promotes fun competition between my husband and me!"
5,Worked out exactly as expected,"After reading all the reviews, and discovering that Consumer Reports also found it to be an excellent buy, I purchased three of these pedometers for myself and family members. The accuracy and ease of use are exactly as advertised. I am very happy with this item!"
5,does what it says,"i bought this as a gift for my wifes grandmother and she absolutely loves it. i wasn't there when it was given to her and neither myself or anyone else have had to answer questions about it which indicates its ease of use. she uses it everyday, every where she goes and it has encouraged her to walk further and further everyday."
2,Misled by the hype,"I read the description and the reviews. I was under the impression that I would be able to keep track of either my aerobic steps or my ""daily"" steps. Since I was interested in starting a 10,000 steps per day program, I thought I could wear it and it would keep track of ALL my steps, including those steps I take in my house while I'm doing housework, and steps I take while I'm in the grocery store or going from the car to the store, etc. It records NONE of those! It will only record steps after you have been walking for about a minute or so at a continual fluid pace, such as walking for exercise. It also won't record steps you take going up stairs! But I didn't even find this out until AFTER I had opened the package and read the instructions inside, and by then it was too late to return it for a FULL refund! So I feel somewhat cheated and VERY disappointed! Other than that.. it does record my power walking steps and it does reset itself during the night, so those claims are true."
4,Great Pedometer for the money,"I purchased my first Omron pedometer at Wal-Mart online for $29.99 and eventually found the pedometer on Amazon for much less. This is a great pedometer which can be worn or carried in your purse and I purchased two in case I lose one. It is a bit large (approx. 2 7/8"" x 2"" or 7.3cm x 5.2cm);I clip it to the band on my underwear and it stays in place very well. The memory keeps seven days of your walking activity which facilitates tracking your progess easy. The only complaint I have is the plastic clip on the lanyard breaks easily;I have broken two of them. I suggest the manufacturer finds a more durable plastic to manufacture the lanyard clip or provide a means to buy replacement clips at a very low price."
4,Good!,"I've been looking for a good pedometer - one that one count steps when you drive over a railroad track in your car! This one is the best I've found so far. I love that you can switch to ""aerobic steps"" when you're walking for fitness."
4,Decent Pedometer,"This functions exactly how you would expect it to. The only issue i have is with the buttons. For being a pocket pedometer, one would think it was designed to be put in pockets. However, if you put it in your pocket, there's a high probability of hitting the buttons accidentally."
2,you get what you pay for,"Again, it'll sort of just generally measure steps. If you're looking for accuracy, look elsewhere. Also, the battery died after one year. It's clunky and hard to program. If you're serious, invest more money in something more robust."
5,Pedometer,This order worked out ok and I like the product. I've had different problems with other orders and can't find a phone number to call you.
1,Piece of Junk,"My new Omron pedometer seriously miscounts the number of steps I take. I tried putting it into my pocket, where it was over by 50%, then the more usual way of clipping it onto my waistband, where it was 20% over - better, but still not acceptable. (One can enter the stride length incorrectly into the pedometer and thereby get wrong values for distance, but I'm talking about just the number of steps taken.) I was careful to have it in an upright position both times. It's gotten good reviews, and a friend of mine loves hers, so maybe I just got a lemon. But it's not even worth the price of postage to return it."
2,Accurate but clumsy,"I don't use this pedometer as often as I would like due to some design problems. First, the belt clip doesn't fasten securely or easily and so the pedometer has fallen off almost every day I wear it. Also, the ""reset"" button is way too easy to hit by accident."
3,Not bad for the money,"Seemingly accurate but trying to put your personal information in it was somewhat a problem. For the price, however, i can't really complain."
5,It really works!,"Every morning when I wake up, my trusty pedometer has reset itself back to zero. I clip it on an article of clothing and off I go. Lightweight."
2,Doesn't turn off!,"This pedometer doesn't EVER turn off, you will need to replace batteries every 5-6 months! I couldn't believe it doesn't turn off and it doesn't say anything about this in the instructions, in fact it says something about turning it off! I thought it was a defect so I returned the first one I bought, clearly stated why I was returning it and needed it replaced, they replaced it alright and then sent me a letter explaining that it doesn't turn off and I would need to replace the batteries in about 6 months...."
1,Never worked...,"Mine arrived quickly but it never really worked. I honestly tried everything that everyone recommended to me. I figured I was at fault since it got such great reviews.Nonetheless, it did not count my steps properly so I gave up. Maybe I got a lemon."
2,It doen't work with loose clothes,"I wear loose-fitting, casual clothes. I cannot find a place to clip this pedometer that will record my foot steps accurately. Often during the day the meter resets itself to zero.I haven't contacted the manufacturer; I don't know what they can advise."
2,Fair to middlin!,"I was disapointed in this as I put it in my pocket or clipped to my belt and after 1/2 hour checked and it hadn't registered even one step. When I go walking, it registers but not all the time doing eeryday activities (up and down stairs, cleaning, etc. As I am trying to reach the 10,000 max, I have no idea where I stand."
2,"If this is the best, then pedometers have a long way to go.",Does not keep an accurate account of steps. I'd say it tallies about one in every three steps on a good day.
3,somewhat satisfied,"I can't really work the thing right, and I don't understand how to change it every day and how it tells you how much weight you lost.Thanks,Anne M Shaffer"
1,two pedometers that can't agree...,"ordered two omrons after reading laudatory reviews. wore both of them for a couple of days, and found that they were wildly divergent in their readings. and neither one counted my steps accurately. i now depend on the much simpler and smaller and more accurate and much cheaper sport line 340 ($6.95.....)"
2,Calorie Counter,"I liked the way Omron HJ 112 Digital Pocket pedometer worked and the information it gave me. However, the clip that held it onto your belt or waist band was not large enough. If your clothes do not have a pocket, the clip on the back of the pedometer is not sufficient enough to keep it there during your movement. I therefore lost the pedometer."
3,So-So,"I was impressed with the reviews prior to purchase. The HJ-112 is impressive and appears durable. I have had it about three weeks and use it every other day on an indoor measured track. The steps appear to be accurate enough, but the mile measure, even after numerous recalibrations IAW the instructions, does not measure very close. This is disturbing as I had planned to use it for distance tracking. I would recommend it only for steps, and that said, I would not buy another just for that purpose."
4,Omron!,Love the meter. I'm just not sure that my stride is accurate. I often question the number of steps registered. I like the auto reset
4,Very Good....,very good pedometer with easy to use interface and sleek design.....but its numbers are slightly off which is kind of an annoyance....but if you want better than average quality and a reasonable price...this is definitely for you
5,Pedometers,I have used this Pedometer daily for nine months now and really like it. I had two previous which were quite inaccurate and quit working after a short while. Once you get your stride adjusted it's always set. I checked the results on 3 different occasions against the odometer on my car and it was right on the mark all 3 times. The fact that it has memory for several days is a plus as well. The price is also reasonable.
4,great pedometer,"Having never had a pedometer before I don't have anything to compare it to. I found it easy to program, easy to use, apparently accurate and able to withstand at least a few gentle falls to the floor."
5,omron pedometer,"This is a great pedometer. I use it every time I walk the dogs and it keeps track of time, miles, steps, k calories, and aerobic miles walked. The battery life is great and it has a 7 day memory to tell you how much you have done in the previous 7 days. I have had other pedometers and this is the best."
5,Omron Pocket Pedometer,"As a Detention Deputy at a County Jail, I started working a new ""Post that requires me to escort inmates & professional visitors through out my Division. As it turns out, what we figured was ""a lot of walking"" turned out to be 7.5 to 9.0 miles per 12 hour shift.I have enjoyed the ease of programming the parameters of the Omron Pocket Pedometer, and I recommend this product highly to anyone who is serious about quantifying their walking workouts."
5,Nifty pocket Pedometer,"This small, lightweight pedometer is easy to use, durable and fun. I ""wear"" it nearly every day unless it is on loan for someone else to try to achieve the 10,000 step goal. I have a couple of other pedometers that I have never used because they are complicated to set and are worn on a belt.My only complaint is that I had fraudulent activity on my credit card immediately after this purchase..."
4,Fun to use,I purchased this product for both my husband and I. We are still trying to get the size of our steps to be right but when we followed the directions in the booklet it was easy. It is fun to see how far we walk and how many steps are arobic and the calories we use.
2,Great idea but not a good buy.,I love the abilities of this pedometer...except...that it keeps resetting itself. I am going back to the Weight Watchers pedometer.
2,Pedometer is just plain WRONG!,"I received this item as a gift for Christmas in '06 and have used it for the entire year thus far. I thought at first I wasn't jogging as far as I normally did and started questioning how in shape I was. Then I decided that there had to be something wrong with the pedometer. I jogged with the pedometer and then drove the same route with my car. The pedometer read 1.6 miles and my car read 3.1 miles. It wasn't even close. I then checked all the settings again and they were right. I decided to walk normally with the pedometer and counted my steps to 100. The pedometer read 74 steps. This thing is supposed to be accurate up to +/-5%. I double checked my stride to make sure that it wasn't off - it was right. I think I must have gotten a total lemon. Other people seem to really like this product but I can't recommend it. It's a shame, I like all the options on it, it's just wrong."
1,"Good idea, but not accurate.","I wanted this pedometer to wear all day. The size was perfect to wear during work to track my steps and distance. I followed the directions carefully to set it up.Unfortunately, within the first few hours I realized that every little motion registered as steps. Even the vibration of my car driving around the city made it register hundreds of unwalked steps. If I couldn't get accuracy, what was the point?I'm very disappointed in this product."
4,A Mostly Great Device at a Great Price,"This electronic pedometer works quite well. For me, I find it works best if I attach the lanyard to my belt on the side, and let the device swing upside down as I walk. It seems less likely to count correctly when I put it in a (....)or pants pocket. I like the automatic end of the day reset. Without a thought I get up each morning knowing the pedometer will start counting a new day's activity.Then I can look back over the past seven days and see how I've been doing."
5,Best Pedometer I've Ever Owned!,"I've had several Sportline pedometers but have found that they tend to be inaccurate and don't last long. The Omron was something different, so I thought I'd give it a try. I've found it to be extremely accurate and easy to use. It's larger than most pedometers, and doesn't fit on my belt very well, but no matter -- I just slip it into my pocket. It's very easy to use, and the memory function is nice, too. It will count ALL of my steps, but I can easily change modes and see how many of those steps were actually at an aerobic pace."
2,nice product if the clip worked,I had this pedometer for three weeks before it broke so badly the face was crushed under the glass and it looked like a weird etch-a-sketch. The problem I had with this product is the clip. It never stayed clipped to my waistband/belt/whatever. It fell all the time. I had to look for it all the time. If I put it in my pocket it did not register steps as well. So my complaint is that it isn't worth the money for 3 weeks of service.
4,Pretty accurate!,"So far I am very pleased. It's pretty spot-on accurate. I even got on my treadmill and counted 100 steps and the pedometer read the same. It gets slightly off when going up and down stairs, but the instructions warn that and I've noticed it off by 2-3 steps. Not significant. I really like the 7 day history so I can go back and compare the week. The mileage seems off and after running 5 miles and being up and around all day once, it only registered 8K steps--oops, not quite! I don't rely on it for running anyway. I use it to pay attention to moving more...now if only I can get motivated to get those 10K steps in every day!"
5,"Great, quiet pedometer","This is a great pedometer. It doesn't have any of the clicking noise to count your steps and has a memory to start each day over at zero steps. Keep the instruction book handy for the first couple of days until you can remember all of the functions and how to access the information it collects, but well worth it!"
4,Omron Pedometer,"Once again We are amazed at how fast your items get delivered..2-3 days on average. We are pleased with the Omron Pedometer and all the information it gives us on our walks. Info such as Calories burned, steps taken which are broken down into Miles walked and the time it took to walk that distance and more. My only negative would be that it's very touchy and measures steps while traveling in the car to start the walk..All in all it's a very good product."
5,Still works great after 1 year.,"I purchased this pedometer over a year ago, and it still works great. For the price it's an excellent bargain."
5,Love this pedometer!,"And so does my husband and everyone else to whom I have given one. Great behavior modification gadget. It provides an incentive for walking,and a disincentive to skip exercises or to drive when you can walk. It is easy and fun to use."
5,"10,000 Steps","Easy to set up and use. Just put it in your pocket and walk. Gives data as steps, calories, and miles. Also has digital time. Automatically resets at midnight. Has memory mode to access data from previous days. Can use clip to attach to waistband, or remove it and slip it into your pocket."
3,Great until it stops counting steps,"The last two of these that I bought were great until they stopped counting steps altogether after less than 6 months. I knew it wasn't the battery, because the clock kept on working. In the past I had several that lasted for a very long time, so maybe the quality isn't as good in the newer versions?On the plus side of pedometers in general, they force me into a daily exercise routine. Without my pedometer, I can't tell how much I'm walking. Doctors should start prescribing these for people for weight loss and general health."
4,Pocket Pedometer,"Works very well and seems to be accurate. It resets automatically each day. I would prefer to reset it at various intervals, but. it isn't a major concern."
5,pedometers are great exercise myth busters,"I had read a health study noting that people who used pedometers to get in the daily 10,000 steps were not only more likely to achieve this goal but motivated to surpass it. And I must say, for my part, it's true. But they also said that buying a slightly more expensive pedometer ($25 or more) will prove more accurate. Also true, in the case of this particular model. I think the best thing about the HJ-112, though, is that the 7-day memory feature motivates me to walk more than I have ever walked, because I see what I've done and want to do better. Before getting this pedometer, I walked about 1/2 hour a day and little more. If it was a shopping day, I wouldn't even bother with an extra walk. Now I realize that I wasn't getting even close to half of the daily recommended number of steps. I really feel better. It's worth the price."
5,Great Product,"If you want to track your steps, it works super. The first one I had quit, but only after going through a wash cycle and a dry cycle twice. Even after going through the first cycle it recovered after drying out, good quality."
4,Great product!,"I use this every day. The clip doesn't work for me, it always pops off my pants pocket, but I place it inside my pocket and forget about it until the evening when I check my steps. The only issue I have is making sure I check the totals before midnight...a few times I have forgotten and when it resets to 0, I don't know how many steps I took the previous day! Highly recommend it."
4,sturdy pedometer,"I have no idea if it's accurate, but instead use it make sure I do a certain amount of steps each day. the clip is great, because I have no idea how many times the device has popped off and then dangled instead of being lost. it also has a watch which is handy. we bought 20 to use as prizes for our work's biggest loser contest, and people love them."
4,"Tough Pedometer, Easy to Use, Good Bargain","This pedometer has proved to be the toughest and easiest-to-use model I've owned so far (this is my third brand). It's light years better than my previous model, the Ozeri 4x3 Motion, and is substantially better made as well. The aerobics feature is especially useful.The only negative for me is that the belt clip itself (that is, the clip that holds the pedometer ""holster"" to your belt) is basically worthless; it lacks any sort of real spring strength and simply refuses to stay on. Fortunately the safety leash has a cleverly-designed clip that saves the day over and over again; make sure you use it. If Omron could design something decent for the belt clip, then this becomes a 5-star product."
5,Best Pedometer Ever!!!,"I have had several pedometers in the past. They don't last long, they are a pain to set up. ETC. Just in passing one day my girlfriend mentioned this model. I ordered it and couldn't wait. It was the easiest thing to set up. And it is very accurate. I love the fact that it has the arobic and normal steps. I mean I wear it all day. For health reasons I don't walk outside but use the treadmill. And it registers those steps as arobic. And it is always within 50 steps of what I figure. The fact that you can put it in you pocket is such a plus. I am planning on giving it as a Christmas gift to several girlfriends. This is great."
4,Great exercise monitor,"Easy to set, seems fairly accurate, and not easily fooled by non-walking movements. The ""security clip"" is great to hang on to the pedometer in case it dislodges from main clip's perch. Haven't used it in a purse yet since I usually wear slacks or jeans. I especially like the retention of a few days' records, and the feature that resets at midnight. It's my walking buddy, giving me something to check with to ensure my exercise program is truly going forward."
4,Good Pedometer,"This is a good product, it keeps good count of your steps. Automaticly goes into fitness mode when you do continounus movement, like walking with your child (like Me). Over all a good product. I had no problems with the belt attachment, like some reviews mentioned."
4,This is the only accurate pedometer I've had,"This is the fourth pedometer I've had. One got lost, another fell into the toilet, and none would come close to counting the steps in the house with carpeting. I like the feature where it automatically sets to zero for each day. I'm glad I read the reviews before purchasing from Amazon because the one negative seemed to be the clip not anchoring strongly enough and thus it was easy to lose. Sure enough, the first day I was wearing it around the house it came unclipped. Fortunately the next day the safety leash I ordered arrived and twice it has kept the pedometer from dropping unexpectedly. The lack of a strong clip is the only reason I gave it four stars."
2,Needs a pause button!!!!,"This pedometer would be great if Omron would include a pause button. Driving to work can add anywhere from 150 to 600 steps depending on traffic. That's 300 to 1200 steps of inaccuracy not counting normal inaccuracies of a percent or 2 for any pedometer. If you never drive anywhere it's great, otherwise it's a waste of money."
3,Great device Very Very Very poor belt clip,It amazes me how a company could make such a wonderfully accurate and feature rich device and then give it a almost nonexistent belt clip. The clip is so flimsy it comes off at the slightest touch. This is on a device that is used to measure exercise levels and distances. When carried inside of a pocket the device was not nearly as accurate and needs to be carried in there with a certain orientation. If not for the belt clip I would have given this a 5 star rating.
4,Pocket Petometer exceeds expectations,"My wife is not a gagdet person but wanted something that could count her steps playing golf, working out and walking. I purchased the Pocket Petometer after doing a little research on line. She has been using it since she received it last month and thinks its the greatest fitness tool. It is easy to learn but complex enough to accomplish the basic needs of establishing baselines and developing metrics to monitor your physical activities."
4,Great Pedometer!,Perfect Pedometer - reads very well whether clipped on to my waist or on my purse. Love that calorie tracking feature! only cons are that you have to keep going thru the numbers to get to your weight (you can't just reverse to a lower number) and also that you can't turn the pedometer off when not in use. But otherwise it's terrific!
4,good mileage,"Easy to use, and accurate. Long battery life. I really like the calorie tracker. The mileage feature was important to me. I'm 56 and I don't own a motor vehicle amd I walk everywhere I go, so I like to know distances. The price was excellent."
4,Great little toy/tool!,"This pedometer is fairly small - I use it in my pocket and you can barely see it's there. (Smaller than a regular Altoids/mint tin, bigger than one of the mini tins.) Every once in a while I get a wildly inaccurate day but mostly it seems accurate.I love that it will give you your approximate distance walked after you've put in your stride length. I'm easily encouraged by little toys like this, so I've found myself walking more since I purchased it!"
4,Pedometer,It works as well as the old style. We just hope the batteries last as long as the older model.
1,Didn't work very well,I bought this because it was a good price and seemed like a decent product. It never worked right for me. It wouldn't record every step that I took.
5,Track your steps --reliably,"I've been using this Omron step counter for at least four years now. I first selected this model when Consumer Reports rated it highly. I agree. I've used many others, and they are pretty worthless. It's got to be reliable and accurate, and this one is. It will even pick up steps in pocket or purse. Easy to read and easy to program. I'm a nurse and health educator, and I recommend this to my students. I take it off my waistband and flash the memory to show how many steps I've had over the past week. Very motivating.Like any stepcounter, they will get lost--fall off your waistband. The extra clip does help. Even if it goes through the wash, it can still be dried out and work. 2032 battery gives long life. At moderate price of $20, and with excellent service from Amazon, I can replace easily.Pat"
4,Very Sensitive and accurate : Does what it is supposed to do,Very Sensitive and accurate : Does what it is supposed to do....the pedometer app on my android phone is not bad too.Having app on the phone helps as you don't have to specially remember to put the device in your pocket
3,Pedometer Rating,"I really like the multiple settings on this pedometer. It even keeps track of your settings for up to 10 days. However, the optional clip on the back isn't deep enough. As soon as I bend over, the pedometer begins to pop off of my waste band."
5,Omron Pedometer,"Purchased for my wife as a gift, this pedometer gives accurate information and is simple to operate. I saw that it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. Great little item."
2,Inaccurate,"I bought this because I wanted a pedometer that I can drop in my pocket. It's nice looking and comfortable. The features are nice. It's easy to set. Customer service is great. Trouble is, this pedometer, regardless of the numerous glowing reviews, is inaccurate.A 12 step auto filter counteracts bouncing in the pocket, but causes the pedometer to undercount during daily movement by about 50% during tests on the waist.I have personally tested this pedometer against numerous other pedometers and find it inferior.I'm now wearing a Yamax Power Walker and like it. I would not recommend any Omron pedometer for the reason stated above.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
2,Great Functionality - But it Keeps Falling Off,"The pedometer seems to be accurate (within +/- 100 steps/day), but it is always falling off. I've bought 2 replacements, but am now looking for another brand, because it's too expensive at $21/unit to continue losing them."
2,Unusual Pedometer,"This pedometer has no capability to ""zero out."" That means if one wants to walk/run twice in one day, one can't zero out the pedometer to measure the second event. I've been running since 1975, have owned approximately ten pedometers, and have never had one that didn't have the ability to zero out. I called the company and they told me they have only one pedometer with the ""zero out"" ability. Very strange!"
4,Track your jogs using this Pedometer!!,"Hi! I bought this pedometer for my wife who subscribed to south beach diet and need to track her walks/jogs and record them. This pedometer was the perfect thing for her as it is small, weightless and easy to carry around. It also records past 6 days of details of your workouts. The only issue that she is facing is that the readings are bit awkwardly programmed. If only the way it displays the information could be simpler, this would have been a great product. For now, this will do but I am going to need to upgrade her as and when required."
1,never worked correctly,I could not get this product to work. It never measured my steps or my distance correctly no matter how it was programed. I bought this product because it was recommended by Better Homes and Gardens but I was very disappointed. If I had kept the original packaging I would have returned it.
5,GREAT UNIT,I had purchased this pedometer for my wife and myself and loved it so much that this one is a gift for a friend. I have never had one that is so easy to use and it is extremely accurate. You can't go wrong with this one.
5,Keeps-me-honest gadget,"This Omrom is one of my best friends...Keeps-me-honest gadget!!! Not too bad for an 80-year-old survivor of breast cancer, 15 other major surgeries, including a new knee. Have had the privilege of seeing the Southern Hempishere and the Northern Hempishere and all of the glories of God and know He guides and directs. Am so happy I can hardly stand it! Use to accumulate 23,000 to 25,000 steps a day ... Now, the the new knee am determined for over 15,000 per day! God helps to guide ... Marvelous!"
5,Great pedometer,"For the price, you can't beat this pedometer!!!What I like about it is that it is reliable (even counts when it is upright though not attached to your body), easy to use (just keep upright, even in a pocket), and sturdy (most other pedometers clips break after a day or two).The clip has kept the pedometer from getting lost or falling many times.The memory is great for reviewing how I've done the last 7 days.This pedometer is does exactly exactly what I need/want it to do for a reasonable price."
2,Disappointed,"I was searching for an accurate pedometer. This one isn't it. No matter how we calibrate it, and measure accurately, no matter whether in the pocket or clipped on, it's off."
1,No battery,"In the description for this product they claim that it comes with a battery. We order 6 of these, in two shipments for a 10k a day challenge at work. Four of the pedometers came with batteries and the other two did not. This means an extra trip to the store, spending another $5 on a battery and not being able to take part in the first day of the challenge. Disappointing."
2,Warning No Reset Button,"This seems to be an accurate pedometer, but the new model lacks a reset button. If you want to reset your steps for a certain event or excercise walk you can't without resseting the entire unit. I called Omron about this and they stated that for some reason the version which is being sold now lacks a reset button. The new model is called the HJ-112N. For some people not having a reset button might not matter, but many people really like to be able to reset the unit for various activites throughout the day. You can reset the entire unit, but when you do that you lose all of your data. I bought two of these and both are being returned."
4,"A fine gadget, even if I don't really get it","I have to fess up...I don't use even half the functions on this pedometer. I bought it (over other items) because it was cheaply and conviently packaged with the YOU: On a Diet book.I will say that I wanted something I wouldn't have to monkey with and this meets that requirement. I popped in the battery, set the time and date (easy as setting any digital watch with just one consultation of the instruction book) and started counting my steps that day.I have not had any trouble with it and it's pretty intuitive to operate. I easily discovered on my own how to switch days and check walking steps/ aerobic steps.Overall I'm really happy but probably don't need all the bells and whistles."
4,Omron offers bad customer service,"While I agree that this pedometer is good, mine did not come with the battery that was supposed to be included in the package. After calling the 800 number for Omron Customer Service, the only solution they could find was for me to ship the unit back to them at my expense for them to replace it under its warranty with one that actually had a battery. They told me that they DO NOT handle batteries and it was my tough luck, and no, they wouldn't refund me the cost of having to go out and buy one. They suggested I deal with Amazon and I did. Thank you Amazon for crediting me for the amount of a battery. I still had to go out and buy one but at least I did not get the cold shoulder like I did from Omron. It appears that the battery does not last long in this pedometer and so twice a year you will have to unscrew the little screw and replace it."
4,Omron pedometer,"This pedometer is quite advanced and has a lot of features. Unfortunately, I have had a little trouble setting it up. Also, I don't go to bed until 2 am and it turns over at midnight. The only way I have found to overcome this is to set the clock back 2 hours."
4,"Accurate, Resilient, Easy to Lose","I recommend this product for its durability and accuracy.I have dropped it on rock, hardwood floors, asphalt, and concrete with no loss of function. When one went through the wash, it still collected accurate data, but the display was compromised in that some of the LCD segments did not darken.Omron could improve the HJ-112 by putting a stronger spring in the clamp of the belt holder. I have lost one HJ-112, others I know have lost a few. I no longer use the belt holder. The HJ-112 does fit comfortably in a watch or change pocket."
5,Greatest pedometer ever,"I love this pedometer! Having purchased and lost at least 5 pedometers, my favorite feature of this pedometer is the separate clip and string that attaches it to the unit. Wonderful! wonderful! wonderful!"
4,Fine Pedometer,"I've use a few cheap and free pedometers that either record every little adjustment you make whether sitting or walking, or maybe record every 10th step. So far this has been very consistent in recording the steps and doesn't count when in a vehicle. It may be a little pricier than some of the basic pedometers, but if it works and lasts, it'll be worth it in the long run. You can buy fancier ones, but when all you need is an accurate count of your steps per day, this is it."
1,"Does exactly as described, but no way to start and stop it.","PROS:This product does exactly what it says it does. It's easy to use, cheaply priced, tracks steps, seems to be pretty accurate, and has memory for 7 days. I love the fact that it displays distance traveled in miles, since this is primarily what I bought it for.CONS:The problem that I see with it, is that you can't start or stop the step counting. This is a big problem, since you are not always walking. If you are in your car, it will count every bump in the road, which by the end of the day will give you a hugh false reading. This unit is way to sensitive and will pick up any little bump. A simple start and stop button on the front would have been perfect. I am forced to stick a pin in the back master reset button, re-enter the time, my weight, and stride length, if I want an accurate reading. This however is not very convenient. From what I see from the other pedometers, not having a start and stop button is the norm."
1,Wouldn't count accurately walking and not at all in my pocket,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerI chose this pedometer since it was highly rated and supposed to work on my waist, pocket or purse. It counted erratically and, most of the time, not at all. Counting my own steps compared to the pedometer, it picked up about twenty percent when it was counting.It didn't count at all in my pocket. We set it for my husband's weight and stride and it counted about half his steps when speed walking, not at all at a normal pace. I returned the product."
5,Great Value,This is a great pedometer. It works clipped on or inside your pocket. The seven day memory helps keep track of your progress.
5,Very good product,"I love this pedometer! It is the most accurate pedometer that I have ever had. I tested it on my treadmill and when I walk. I have put it on my belt loop and also in my pants pocket and it works great! I like the feature at 12:00pm it resets itself back to zero. I would highly reccommend it, worth the money!"
5,Makes me more active,"Since I got this pedometer, I am very aware of how much I walk per day. I have even taken to parking farther way and compete with my husband. Still have not gone much over 5000 step per day!!!I like the seven day review and the reset every night."
3,Starting each walk from Zero Omron pocket pedometerHJ-112,"Bought this from AmazonIf I take 4 walks per day and wish to know the total for each walk, how do I set the distance back to zero at the beginning of each walk w/0 doing a complete reset?If I understand the note at top of page 19' it resets the display to 0 at 12:00 am automatically which is not what I want. I want to be able to see each walk distance.Help"
3,Accuracy of Pedometer.,Maybe I am not using it right but a lot of times the pedometer doesn't count my steps. My steps may be too short but if I jog a mile on the tread mill the pedometer does not have the same results. It has far less. I do have good days where the steps seem right and bad days when I feel I walked more than what the pedometer shows. My only issue is that it does not match the result on the tread mill.
1,Doesn't work,"I bought it for a big trip on which I'd be doing a lot of walking. However, when I got there, I found the pedometer highly inaccurate. No matter where I placed it...on my hip, in my bag (as advertised) it would either register no steps or hundreds more than I had taken. I checked it periodically, counting 200 steps in my head and then checking to see what it said. I tried changing my outfit. Same problem. I tried holding it in my hand, and it would jump from 1 step to 30 steps without anything in between. What I really wanted was one I could carry in my bag. Otherwise, it's waaaaaaay too bulky to wear under an outfit, even to work!!! Very disappointed. Wondering if it's a defective one?"
2,"I use it, but is NOT what I ordered!","When I ordered this Item there was a Picture posted with the Pedometer showing 4 buttons, one was to RESET it by hand, so you don't have to wait till midnight for the Item to do it automatically, and that's the model I wanted and ordered.....well, guess what? They send me the Pedometer that every one gets, with the three buttons, since I wasn't aware of it and had already cut the plastic casing to get to the unit, I couldn't send it back, so I'm Stuck with it!I will never order from this seller again!"
2,Not for disabled walker,"This pedometer did not work well for me at all;, I'm disabled and working on mygait, the device would not register my cadence at this time, it works fine for others with no instability in their gait"
5,it's my new best friend.,"i wake up and put it on right away.i make sure i can wear it all day long.i find myself taking the stairs, or the long way more often.i actually don't mind walking back/with a friend to grab something from the car.i only look at it at the end of the day.i've discovered that i need to walk more, and the only way i could accomplish that is by tracking my progress every few days with this. :) i LOVE that it keeps data for the previous week. if i'm busy 3-4 nights in a row, the distances/kcals/etc. are still there for me to log when i have a few moments to spare.i find the clip a little bulky for my taste, so 99% of the time i just stick it upside-down in my right pocket and secure it with the string: i loop it around my 4:00 belt loop and clip it back onto itself. practically invisible. yay!i'm so glad i bought this. :D"
4,"So far, so good","I've been using this pedometer about three weeks now, and so far - so good. I'm mostly using the clip to attach it to my waistband, and it seems quite sturdy. Due to my own butter fingers, I've dropped it a few times, and it seems to have been unharmed.I appreciate all the various readings, even though I don't really use them all. Just one note for the Omron people: you really missed an opportunity by not installing an alarm or panic button on the device. As a woman who walks alone, that is one feature I would definitely have appreciated."
5,good product,I purchased this product from the reccommendation of Consumer Reports. It works great and is easy to use. I wear it attached to my right pants pocket while I work on copiers and it doesn't get in the way of my normal movements.
5,thrilled with this product,"needed a simple pedometer that i would not lose. i have lost at least 10 in the year before i got this one. more than basic for me, the memory is also helpful for tracking progress. highly recommended"
5,da Motivator,Having this particular pedometer has been quite a motivator for me with my exercise plan. I am encouraged to walk more since I can just look at my step count. I would definitely recommend this product. The only drawback is that there is no on/off button.
1,Unreliable,"I bought this pedometer early September. It worked fine for a week and then has stopped at zero. I reset it more than once, but without any result. I was too lazy to return it, but thought of placing my experience on record."
3,Great unitl it disappears,I only had mine for a short time. Worked great but I lost it off my waistband. Clip is not strong enough nor is the clip that attaches to the pedometer.
5,Best pedometer!,"This device is the best. Simple, without a lot of unnecessary features. Reasonable price. I called toll-free Customer Service because I overlooked how to set my stride length (I thought the pedometer was defective - thought it was feet in decimals, but it was feet + inches) & the guy quickly figured out what I was doing wrong so all was well. I love the little safety clip. I love that you can place the device in many different positions & places on your body or in purse or pocket, & it still works. My previous pedometer at the same price from ""Sportsline"" or some such I had to rig up my own string/safety thing & I still broke the device because of the way the clip was configured, plus I could only wear it at my waist."
4,worth the price,I have been using the Omron HJ 112 Digital Pocket Pedometer for a few weeks now and I am very happy with it. It easily slips into a pocket or clips to a waistband. It is easy to set up and easy to read. I like the way it resets itself to zero everyday. The instructions say you can put it in your purse. I haven't done that because I am more active than my purse. The only improvement I would make is a back light so you could read it after evening walks.
4,"Best Pedometer, don't bother with the others","I've used other pedometers, and this one is by far the best. Not only does it track total steps and aerobic steps separately, it also calculates mileage and calorie loss. It's important to calibrate it properly by determining and setting your stride. I even walked into a pool with it on accidentally (duh) and it was submerged for probably a minute before I figured it out. It never stopped working. You can tuck it in a pocket or a handbag, or clip it to a belt. It's a bit bulky, that's my only complaint. It would be nicer if it had a flatter profile. But a superb product and well worth the money."
4,Works good!,"So far, after two weeks of using this pedometer, it has yet to shut off. In the instructions, it says after 5 minutes of not touching any buttons or moving it, it should shut off on its own. It does not. I was the fourth person of my group of friends that are training for a 60 mile marathon, that purchased the same model pedometer, and we all have the same issue. Besides that, it seems to be accurate and it isn't as sensitive to false (non-walking) movement as others I have had. I would recommend this product!"
4,"fairly accurate for walking/jogging, wish it had off button","This pedometer is still working after 6 years and several battery replacements, but the clasp that attaches the cord to clothing broke last year. It seems fairly accurate for walking/jogging, but does not seem to recognize movement on a ski machine, rarely registering steps or distance at all. This maybe makes sense given the relative smoothness of the movement, but there is still some side-to-side rocking motion involved with a ski machine.Wish it had an off button. It just keeps using up the battery, whether or not it is being worn. Measurements roll back to zero at midnight, with the last seven days accessible through the memory button. Also, do not know what the kcal measurement represents. Does not seem to be related to food calories used, especially if a factor of 1000 is involved."
5,Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer (Purchased on 04/09/2011),This is my second one. It is very durable and an excellent value. You have to make sure you use the clip that comes with it. I needed to replace my first one because I forgot and washed it. :( It doesn't do well in the washer. I bought one for my husband who uses his all the time. Great pedometer.
5,Best pedometer I've owned,"This is by far the best and easiest to use pedometer I've owned. It resets itself daily, yet stores your information. It was quick to set up, just measure off your steps, add the information into the Omron and it's ready to go, that easy! I walk with a friend daily and with the Omron I just pop it into my pocket and it reads no matter what it's position in my pocket. My friend says the next pedometer she's buying will be an Omron."
5,I luv this pocket pedometer,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerI absolutely luv this pedometer. I had tried several other brands, but they would not work, or didn't count correctly. Mostly because my stomach would make the pedometer slant forward, and it wouldn't count. Then, when I started losing weight, and my pants got loose, the pedometer would slant forward, and it wouldn't count.Now, I can slip it in my pocket, and I get accurate readings. And when I wear a dress, I can attach it to my half slip. I didn't believe it would count if attached to my purse, and it did. I strongly recommend this product."
2,"Very accurate, but some problems","I really like the fact that the Omron HJ-112 Pedometer is very accurate.However, I found it confusing to set up and had to get some help from another person to get it right (I hope). I also wish that it would face up when attached, instead of down, for when I wish to check my progress as it is clipped to the waistband of my jeans/slacks. It is awkward to try to read. I do not wish to carry it in my pocket. I also wish that it could be less bulky and a bit smaller, as it frequently becomes disconnected from my waistband and thank goodness for the safety band that I bought for it or I would have lost it several times. I feel that it could be a much better product if these changes could be made. If these improvements could be made, I might consider buying another one."
4,Reliable Reading,This is one of the better pedometers I have purchased. The only down side is that the holder doesn't stay attached well to belts or pants. It is always coming loose and falling off.
4,At last!,Finally I have a pedometer that functions as advertised. It stays securely attached to pant pocket or waistband. I have not tried carrying it in a bag. The best part is it was half the cost of the same item in the local drugstore.
3,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,"Bought this pedometer based on great reviews. This pedometer is ok, but a big mistake in my opinion is no reset button, which makes it inconvenient to reset to zero, as per the manufacturers instructions, immediately in the middle of walking or jogging, as you have to re-enter all your preset settings, instead of just pushing a button to zero display information only, leaving your settings untouched. Also the calorie count seems a little light compared to other pedometers, and my treadmill. Overall it seems to count steps correctly, and miles, provided your step stride is measured correctly. Sportline 360 is a better pedometer, and gives more information than the Omron, plus has a nice reset feature without having to reset stride, weight, etc. each time you zero your functions."
4,"Good pedometer, but no Clear button","This seems to be a fine pedometer, well constructed and with reliable detection of steps. It's probably perfect for people who want to count their daily steps. That's not exactly what I wanted, though. I take various hikes, and I like to measure the distance on each one, which means I want to start the pedometer at zero. But there's no easy way to do that. It clears itself at midnight, but there's no other way to clear it easily. One hard way is to manually set the time to 11:59 pm, wait a minute, then set it to the correct time. Another way is to use the general reset, but that also clears the stride length.Every other pedometer I've owned has had a Clear function. I was surprised to discover that this one did not."
5,Janeo,This was a wonderful purchase. My husband and I walk every day and this is a great way to keep up with our miles. Not only have we bought them for ourselves but friends have asked us to purchase for them as well. I am hooked on my Omron pedometer.
2,Save Your Money,"I really loved this pedometer when I first got it. It tracked everything I did, even the ""steps"" I took while working out with exercise DVDs. I loved that I could carry it in my pocket and it still accurately counted my steps. Then, the battery went dead. I replaced it, and it was no longer accurate. I re-entered the stride-length information, as the directions specified, and it just wasn't counting steps accurately anymore. I thought maybe I bought a bad battery, so I bought a new one and re-replaced it. Unfortunately, that didn't help. I'm very disappointed in this product."
5,I chose wisely..,"I have purchased many pedometers, had many problems, but this one works well for me. It is easy to program,easy to read and use and it really does work in my pocket. Every night it goes back to 0, ready to use in the am. I have had no problems with it re-setting on its own and the clip holds it well. The only problem I have encountered is forgetting to put it on in the morning."
2,Product is not as advertised,"This product was purchased because it was advertised to work effectively being carried in the pocket of your pants.This does not happen, it is much more effect being attached to the belt, but it does not document the correct mileage.Very disappointing and would not purchase again."
5,Great product!,"I use the Omron pedometer daily and I have been very happy with it. I just slip it in my pocket to keep a running total of the number of steps I take. It tends to keep me more aware of the precise amount of walking exercise I get in, particularly during a work day at the office. The HJ-112 provides a reminder of how much more walking I need to complete to meet my daily exercise goals. I've found it to be a very accurate step counter and mileage indicator. It is easy to use and has been reliable and problem free. I purchased additional ones for some of my family members."
5,Pleased,I was very pleased with the quickness of shipment and the quality of the pedometer. It is simple to use and keeps accurate readings. Would highly recommend this pedometer to anyone who's lokking for one.
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT,"I have used at least 5 other pedometers and thought I'd try the HJ-112 since the reviews were positive and I'm glad I did. Works well in pocket or on hip. Accurate, not too bulky and very light weight. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a pedometer that you can trust."
4,walking,Love my Omron pedometer and am in the habit of using it every day even if not walking a lot. This is incentive to walk more to increase my steps. A very useful tool to assist in weight loss and achieving optimum health.
4,pedometer,"very good, the instructions for set up good be a little more straightforward, however so far so good. one thing they good improve even when doing aerobic exercise for some reason it does not record them as steps"
2,poor clip,THE CLIP PROVIDE FOR THIS ITEM WAS VERY POORLLY DESISIGNED DID FIT OVER BELT AS WELL AS NOT HOLDING TIGHT TO THE BELT LOST PEDOMNETER AFTER ONE DAY BECAUSE CLIP DID WORK PROPERLY
3,CLIP kinda small.. Hope i dont lose it.!,once i set my correct stride length i should be fine..any idea on how to measure running stride versus walking?
4,Does the job,"Does the job, even works carried in my pocket or backpack. Pleasently supprised I walk 10-17K steps a day. One of the best units for less than $20"
2,Not Accurate,Bought this product for my brother for his birthday. He walks everyday and notices it doesn't measure the steps accurately. Another setback is it is tough to reset the pedometer so it resets at the end of the day. Not easy to use at least not for me.9
5,works very well,I bought this for my wife who has recently begun exercising. I am a couch potato and so have not used it personally but I know two things. It works and it seems to have been a big hit among those who like to exercise. That makes it a 5 star gift for me right there and if I ever feel the urge to exercise I will get another one just for me.
2,Pedometer,The pedometer came without the battery and a screwdriver it was supposed to have. The set up instructions were good but there were no use instructions. I installed a battery and tried it out and found that it required too much button pushing.
4,Exercise,"I gave this as a gift. My wife loves it. Setup is easy and it seems to be accurate, and operate as described."
1,Newer model but one less feature,"Beware buyers of the newer version of the HJ-112 pedometer. It lacks one important feature the older version of the same model had: the ability to reset to zero the counter. If you do multiple workouts during a day, this feature is handy so you can measure each workout separately. The old model had four buttton on the face, including a reset button. The new version has only three buttons, with the reset replaced by a set button which when pressed resets all stored information like time, stride, etc. You cannot do a temporary reset to zero. So if you walk twice a day, you cannot measure two separate workouts. You get a total for the entire day and only at midnight, the pedometer resets to zero.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerOnly after calling Omron's customer service did I find out the new HJ-112 pedometer has an ""N"" designation, i.e., HJ=112N. Amazon's listing does not show this. I am disappointed that a very useful feature was eliminated."
4,"Accurate, easy to use--but easy to lose","I purchased this pedometer last week from Amazon, and had it set up and going in no time flat. The instructions were easy to understand and the pedometer was easy to program. Accuracy is unmatched compared to other pedometers I have tried. This pedometer is rated highest by Consumer Reports, and I would have to agree. My only complaint, and the reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that, using the belt clip, I have had it fall off several times, and in fact I thought I had lost it altogether but ended up finding it under the bed in a room where it had fallen off while I was vacuuming. It has also fallen off when I was walking. Thankfully it did not break. I would say it is impact resistant since it fell onto hard surfaces several times without incident. This model does come with a strap, which I will now use every time. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this pedometer and would highly recommend it. I would definitely purchase it again."
2,No Battery,"I have yet to use the product because it didn't come with a battery. The advertisement may not have been specific, but I usually look for that kind of thing when buying online, so I think it must be implied. Should have specific language ""Battery not included"" especially since it is not a battery that can be easily found."
3,Safety strap included,"I bought this pedometer because it was top rated in Consumer Reports. I bought two, one for my wife, one for myself. I bought safety straps because in the Amazon reviews, people were complaining because they were losing the pedometers. Well my pedometers came with safety straps so now I have extra. No biggie since the 2 straps were less than $5 including shipping.The pedometer seems to work very well and repeats accurately. You have to enter your step length to the nearest inch. I would like to be able to enter a more precise number than the nearest inch but maybe I am too picky here.There is no on/off switch. The only way to turn it off is to take it off and lay it somewhere because when it is on you, it is counting every step you take. It resets automatically to zero each day and you can recall back 7 days. I would prefer a manual reset capability. The price is right so I would buy it again but if there was another one with the features this one lacks, I would buy that one."
1,Didn't work for me.,"This pedometer received good reviews and that's why I purchased it but I found it did not keep accurate distance when I ran. You do have to ""set"" your stride on the pedometer and I'm sure that has everything to do with its accuracy but my stride varies depending on my energy level. If you keep this info. in mind then maybe it would work for you. One of the very few returns for me."
4,like it,I wish i could get the stride set right on this so it would track steps correctly. other than that its really good and seller was as well.
3,My wishes for a pedometer!,"First wish: Make it possible to open the ""bubble"" package it comes in without cutting my hands and using nasty words in the process. Next wish: Figure out the programming so that it is simple and direct. Did not realize this little thing took so much time to get to work properly."
5,Great Pedometer,I love how slim this is & that the clip is very easy to remove so I can fit the pedometer im my pocket or purse & it still keeps track of my steps. Love the 7 day memory so I can see how I have done & it keeps me on track.
2,Defective,"I got this pedometer for Christmas, and the first battery lasted 8 months. Now, it has gone through 3 new batteries in one week, and there is nothing more frustrating than having your pedometer die in the middle of a day, and not having any more batteries on hand. :("
3,"Omron HJ-112 pedometer, OK but...","This pedometer does only the basics, and for some people that's exactly what they want. It resets the counts, mileage, steps, etc., at midnight of each day. It stores a week's worth of readings for review. What it does, it does quite well, but there is no way to use it in any way not already pre-programmed.After using it for a while I came to miss being able to reset the counts when I wanted so as to use it as a ""trip pedometer"" and make other changes. Nor is there any way to turn it off to conserve the battery, and it seems to go through batteries fairly quickly. Not awful, but not great, either.Setting it up is not intuitive. All in all, I'm disappointed, but this is partly my own fault. I thought I wanted something absolutely simple and it turned out I wanted more."
5,Just what I was looking for,"Great pedometer, easy to use, nice options. Can track mileage which is great is you have an every day goal. Comes with a clip and a sturdy strap."
4,I really like it,I found this pedometer easy to use and accurate. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it is not possible to turn it off
3,Broke after 11 months.,The first one I got worked well for 11 months. Then broke. I sent it in under the guarantte. It cose $5 to reture it and they make you pay $5 to send it back. I dont think that is mutch of a guarantee. I got a new one but it does not allways work right.
4,Omron HJ-112 digital pedometer,"I really like this pedometer so far. It seems to be quite accurate. When I count 100 steps and then check, it's within 5 steps. So far I haven't tried it mounted anywhere except clipped on the waistband of my skirt or slacks, but it's supposed to record accurately even when carried in a purse.I like the fact that it counts total steps and also aerobic steps. For it to register aerobic steps, you have to walk steadily for at least 10 minutes. It also records the minutes you walk aerobically.I hope this pedometer continues to perform well. I have thrown away so many that I was getting discouraged."
2,Not as advertised,"I am disappointed with this product on at least two fronts. First it will not allow you to have two sessions in the same day with out completely resetting the device, (a lengthy procedure requiring that you reset the time, your weight and your stride, for each session). second it failed after just a few months of very careful care and use, completely losing an hours worth of exercise, then failing to allow a reset thus becoming useless. Another thing I am not sure any can handle is that accuracy depends on the accuracy of your stride input with only one type of exercise, (ie if you input your pace walking, the run part of the way all bets are off). I learned to average well enough on this last thing but you need to be able to estimate well and if you excercise twice in one day the reset becomes... you get the idea."
1,Not Suited to Slow/Halting Gait,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium PedometerThis pedometer came highly recommended for accuracy and great features. I can see why it would work well for a person with a normal gait. However, the manual states that it is NOT accurate for slow walking e.g. in a crowded mall. I wouldn't have known this until I received it and found it didn't even register my steps due to my slow, uneven gait, resulting from MS. My physical therapist recommended I use a pedometer to track my steps, but I'll need to find one that works for me."
1,I own 3 pedometers. This one is the most expensive but the least accurate,"This unit does not count all your steps. It only counts steps under certain conditions. From the owner's manual:""The unit may not count steps correctly..."" when:""The unit is not positioned correctly."" It must be perpendicular to the ground, so girls, forget just putting in your purse. The manual also says not to put it in a rear pocket. I find it only works at all when it is on your hip!""The unit moves irregularly.""""Walking at an inconsistent pace"" So forget counting steps while cooking, shopping, working or other ""inconsistent pace"" tasks. If you want to know how many stips you take during the day, this is NOT for you.""Up and down movement"" ""Ascending of descending movement at stairs of in a steep slop"". I would not have purchased this item if I knew just this one thing.""Vibrations from a moving vehicle""""Jog or walk extremely slowly"""
2,Not very durable,"I've only had the HJ-112 for six months.It became intermittant 2 weeks ago and now has stopped all together.It has been dropped twice, the belt clip doesn't really keep it secure.While the features and function are fine, I wish it would have lasted longer.What can you expect for $20???"
4,Very good pedometer`,My only complaint is that the battery lasts only a few months.The little lock-strap has saved the item from falling countless times.
1,CANNOT MANUALLY RESET TO ZERO !!!!!!!!!!,"I was astonished to find out that there is NO MANUAL reset on this unit. So you go for a walk in AM, come home , have lunch. Then take another walk after dinner---you CANNOT reset your mileage to zero !!!! This unit does automatically reset itself each day at midnight to zero. I would say in my opinion that this is one of the absolute WORST systems designs on a product that I have ever seen !!! Its great if you want to tally your TOTAL distance for the day, but what if another family member wants to borrow it for a walk ??? HOW STUPID could OMRON be ???------DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT if you take more then ONE walk per day !"
3,pedometer,"Lost it in less than a week. Clip not very secure. I'll stay w/ the cheaper ones, they seem to have better clips and I won't feel so bad if I lose it."
2,not so good,it is not so accurate. I have tried to adjust many times and can't get it right. no pleased with this product.
2,Very cheap Chinese plastic but ok,"The unit works ok, it's over-priced and should be priced like a cheap calculator in my opinion.The characters are super small almost requiring a magnifying glass."
3,failed quickly,Worked well out of the box but within 2 wks with normal use it failed and is now back at Omron for (hopefully) repair.
5,excellent. better than expected,"I love being able to track the last week for steps, aerobic steps, and distance. And, I like that I can customize it for my step length."
4,Only one issue...,"The Omron HJ-112 pedometer is a nice, simple little piece of equipment at a great price. Very easy to set up and navigate it's various modes. Straightforward steps, distance, calories output based upon weight and stride length input; it also functions as a watch. Just one reason for four stars, the belt clip has proven inadequate for me. It must have fallen off my belt four times in the first two days that I had it. My solution has been to just stick the pedometer in my pocket, no biggy but a better belt clip a-la a cell phone type would have been nice."
4,good gift too,easy to use and read. also provides several measures to encourage you to keep moving. inexpensive and batteries last a long time.
1,Not complete,Came missing a vital component necessary to attach pedometer to a belt or pants. Why receive an incomplete product? It cost to ship back out of my own pocket.
2,Loved it.....while it worked,"I found this to be a great motivational tool. Easy to use, easy to read, and seemed fairly accurate. However, having only owned it for 4 months now, the step counter frequently locks up. It literally misses hundreds of steps. It has never been dropped or mishandled. It was nice while it worked. It's just an aggravating piece of garbage now."
3,I know this has gotten good reviews but.......,I can't get this 1) to stay on my waist and 2) to keep an accurate count of my steps. Evidently it will not calculate correctly if you wear anything but tennis shoes.....forget sandels. Also....it does NOT keep correct count if it's in my pocket or purse. What can I say.....that's been my experience with this pedometer...and it's supposed to be one of the best!
4,omron hj-112,"The only things I don't like are the size of the unit and the clip. Thank goodness for the safety clip because the main clip does not hold well at all. And the unit is quite a bit too large. Other than that, I love it!!!!"
3,Bad Clip is Weak Link,"This is an excellent pedometer mechanically but your chances of not losing it are slim. They need to design a better clip. It kept falling off my belt and several times I successfully retrieved it by retracing my steps to various locations I had visited. I tried to be more cautious but eventually it fell off one too many times. Since you are supposed to be using this device as an adjunct to being active you would expect it to be adapted for such circumstances. Apparently this is a flaw with most pedometers. The clip is not made to properly stay fastened to your belt and if it falls off you won't hear it since it's made of plastic. If you want to keep it, then you'd best keep it in your pocket."
3,False readings,"Good product, easy to understand. However, I noticed that when the pedometer is in my pocket and riding in a van during my commute, I will get extra steps I didn't take (anywhere from 200-500 each way for a 40 min drive). Bummer!"
2,Omron HJ 112,"I have had bad luck with this step counter. I liked the added features of customizing your stride and calorie counting, so I purchased it over cheaper models. I had to send the first one back as it stopped counting. It was replaced and within one week the same thing happened. As far as it counting your steps while in your purse, I found this did not work either. I spoke with the company today and they want me to send it back for repair.I can't say I would recommend this product to anyone."
