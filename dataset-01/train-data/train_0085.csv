3,"Love the watch, hate the band","I used to get Casio sport watches but switched to this one a few years ago because of the Indiglo backlight (much better than Casio). Discovered I liked the watch much better too!Love the watch. But hate the band. The resin band breaks after about a year and replacements cost a third of the price of the watch ($12) IF you can find them. All the local stores have stopped carrying bands and I can only buy online, so now with shipping, the price is closer to half of a new watch.The band issue is a HUGE problem with the entire Timex Ironman line. So consider this watch a disposable item!"
2,I've owned 3 of these watches over the past 2 years,"I've owned 3 of these watches over the past 2 years. On the first one, I cracked watch face while doing some yard work. I broked the strap mount on the second watch. The third watch died after I went swimming in a pool. The displayed become fuzzy after I got out of the pool and it wouldn't work the following day. It's too bad that the watch is not durable. I like the functions, the style, and the way it fits. It's just built with cheap materials that won't last."
1,No FLIX,"It clearly says the watch offers the hands-free FLIX Indigo activation. However, that feature is not on this watch. That's really the only reason I bought this model."
1,No FLIX,"This watch does not have the FLIX feature, though it is clearly advertised in the product description. This is blatant false advertising."
2,No flix and I know flix,"I like this watch, but it bought this one because it was described as a flix watch. Upon arrival there was no flix feature, just the night setting. The watch itself gets five stars, it just wasn't as advertised."
3,Not user Friendly,My previous Timex watch allowed me to turn the stopwatch on in one step. This one u must press the mode switch to bring the stop watch function up then press the start button. Alot of hassle. The band also has a notch on the band that makes it a hassle getting off and on. I really loved my old Ironman. This new one is just OK
1,Truffle Making with this product,Honestly there were about 2-3 uneven marks on the inside where you pour chocolate. This product does not have flawless molds on the inside to make that perfect dome for those of you who (like myself) absoloutly need it perfect. It seems as if they were made too fast in super large amounts.
2,Follows a common pattern,"This book betrays a problem common to CIA literature: It focuses heavily on the administrative and bureaucratic side of the CIA, made possible by the various freedoms afforded to any American researcher. There are plenty of books written by former CIA operatives that explains their work in depth, and they are more interesting.For politics junkies and fellow Washingtonians who charge through nevertheless, I'd recommend skipping the last few chapters altogether and reading Steve Coll's Ghost Wars instead. It's more intelligent and better researched."
2,Bias,"This is not a history book. This work drips with political taint; by that I mean that the author has a view in mind and sets out to persuade you the reader of that view, ignoring or minimizing events and information that might lead you to a different conclusion. As an intelligence professional, I couldn't stomach it past the first hundred pages.If you read only this book about the CIA, you will believe it to be a corrupt and ineffective apparatus of clumsy power. While a popular view, it's not correct. But if you already believe that the CIA is a bastion of evil stupidity, prepare to have your belief system validated.It gets two stars because it does actually include correct facts; it's missing three because they are only select facts, separated by manipulation."
2,Mixed review,"This is strange. I ordered two of these pillows in one order but they shipped separately. The first one is quite soft and comfortable. The second one I received is extremely overfilled and hard. In fact, after sleeping on my side I woke up with an aching ear from the pressure! (I like firm pillows, but this is ridiculous!) However, according to the labels on the pillows, they are precisely the same model. I guess this is consistent with other reviews: some people describe it as very soft and others as very hard. So take your chances and see what you get. I can't use the hard pillow, but my cat seems to like it."
1,pillow review,"This is the worst pillow I have ever owned! When you wake-up with a severe neck ache, you know there is a problem. Sealy has such a good name and the reviews were excellent...wish I had not purchased it! Over-filled and hard."
5,Smooth vocals from an extraordinary voice!,"This is one of those ""discoveries:"" a performance recorded long ago, re-released. Jones combines his considerable vocal skills with an outstanding group of musicians and a ""with it"" audience to give the listener a memorable live musical experience. I first bought the album in the '70s -- on vinyl -- and had long since discarded it. I literally wore it out. To my delight, it was released again in '93, this time on CD, a medium that will assure years of scratch-free listening enjoyment. Even though he doesn't get the press raves normally accorded Tony Bennett, Jones ranks right up there as having one of the smoothest voices of our time. ""Live at the Sands"" showcases that vocal quality on some great selections, in a setting that clearly has Jones, his musicians, and his audience, sharing a terrific performance that will draw any listener right into the center of the room."
1,"GREAT PAPERWEIGHT, POOR THERMOMETER","Great looking paperweight, lousy thermometer. When placed adjacent to top tier weather equipment (i.e. Maximum, Boston, Shatz) the Weems & Plath thermometer was at least 10 degrees off. Just to be sure, I placed this thermometer in the freezer for a quick test and, alas, it registered 70 degrees!!! The unit, which I am returning to Amazon was either defective or badly designed. Whether quality control or engineering, a sad day for Weems & Plath"
5,Are you an effective teacher?,Josh Hunt has done an excellent job with this book. Two very strong benefits the reader will glean from this book are 9 Types of Questions and what it means to Review in a Bible Study context. The benefits from understanding and applying these two sections of Hunt's work will be great and teachers will find they are becoming more effective in teaching the Bible.
4,A dark western,"This is not your typical western, it more a character study than an action thriller but the the cast is good and deliver solid performances throughout, even Tab Hunter."
3,TRACK OF THE CAT ------COMPULTION,A very good oldie. As usual Mitchum is able to hold the storys interest. Compultion: The acting was good and the story also was good. If you like Hichcocks movies this will be one for you.
1,"Beautiful print, dreadful picture","This picture isn't 'minimalist', it's empty. The scene that sums it up best for me is where Mitchum, having made his way over the snowy wastes, barricaded himself in a cave, and said to no one in particular, 'well, I have a week's grub to last me', puts his hands into his pockets and -- omigosh! -- no grub! Yup -- he dies because he failed to secure those peanut-butter sandwiches. And yes, Tab Hunter's hero is such a pliable mama's boy, it's inconceivable that any girl, much less Diana Lynn, could find him attractive. Don't let this 'Cat' litter your living room."
2,wow,I read this book and im 13 and i don't think i should have read beacuse the book was very graphic about killing ect. i would not recommend this book to anyone under 13. besides that the storyline was ok. I would only read this book on a rainy day.~*~shelby~*
2,Rated R for scenes of graphic violence,"I was horrified to discover that my 10 year old daughter had found this book in the juvenile section (under 12) of our public library. She was halfway through the book when I realized what it was about. I am upset with myself that I have not been more diligent to look at what she is reading. While well-written, honest, and thought-provoking this book has graphic scenes of rape and murder that even many adults would find troubling. There are also several references that the US Gov't had trained, armed, and basically knew but did nothing about these genocides and of American citizens one quote is ""Most Americans don't know what their government does. Most don't want to know."" I do believe that as citizens of a free & priviledged country we have a responsibility to find out about and try to right wrongs - however not all Americans are this callous. I could say more, but will leave it at that."
4,Basic grammar in Use for Korean learners of English,"I ordered this book from Amazon to use in tutoring two Korean students who had been in my ESL (English as a Second Language) class. They wanted extra tutoring and they already had copies of this workbook. I ordered it and then realized that one of the students had one with English directions, and mine had Korean. I have regretted not sending it back, or checking to see if the English one was available. It really is good though, and the ladies are doing very well."

1,Worst brand and poor customer service,"Toshiba Projection TVs are the worst in the market. And when calling their customer service, forget it. They are just too ignorant and clueless as to how to resolve any problem."
5,"If you remember the cold war, read this book","This is the most bizarre book you'll ever love. If you remember what the world was like when we lived with the real possibility of nuclear annihilation you'll understand the subtext of this suburban world.If you like Don Delilo or Thomas Pynchon you'll like Kathryn Kramer. She's that smart, her language is that carefully crafted. She uses the frivolous and trivial to smack you between the eyes.Read this book."
4,Very Helpful,"This book is well-written and has concise, easy-to-follow instructions. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to be prepared for administrating emergency care to their cat."
3,"Has great features, but range is disappointing","After looking at various models of emergency phone dialers, the skylink has some great features. It's easy to install, has a covered button to prevent accidental calls, holds up to nine numbers and allows you to set how long it rings at each number. Our family bought this device for my grandmother to be able to access help in the the event of a fall. The only problem we have had is the instructions say the pendant has a 100 foot range, but in my grandmother's home it does not cover an area nearly that large. Prior to our purchase of this unit we had purchased and returned another brand due to the difficulty installing and numerous false calls due to a sensitive button with no cancel feature, which the sky link has. The skylink also begins playing a message over the speaker which lets the user know the system has been activated and the message ends when someone responds.Skylink ED-100 Emergency Dialer Kit"
3,Slightly disappointed,"Item is disappointing. There is no way to stop the dialer once it starts. It keeps dialing the next number until it runs out of numbers, even if someone answers it. Emailed Skylink and they said that's correct. Also, when you listen to your recording coming from the unit itself it sounds all garbled, however it is clear enough when it comes through the phone that was called. We kept it because it works, but we're not real pleased with it. Quality of construction seems good. The antenna will fall until you close the case, but it seems OK when the case is closed. I would not buy this brand next time."
5,works as advertised,"This item works as advertised. We bought extra transmitters to place around the house for grandma (i.e, bottom of steps). Tested all transmitters and all transmitters successfully called everyone we programmed into the device. It is a smaller 2 story home, but it worked from basement, upstairs and outside in the yard. A great substitute for the monitored alert systems and saves us significant $ since there are no recurring charges."
3,"Not bad, but not his best work","Assassin is a difficult book to get into, the hook is not as enticing as it could have been, so it took me several weeks of picking it up to take the hook. Once it got to the point and the action started I had trouble putting the book down. The introduction of McGarvey's daughter I though was an interesting touch and I enjoyed the rest of the book. I thought the end was a bit anticlimactic with the two villains not putting up the fight I probably expect from fictional villains. Over all not the worst read but not his best work."
1,Real Imaginary Junk,"The Story is so unbelievable . Reminded me those stories of ""mission Impossible"" Every one knows every thing ahead of time. No secretes. As if it is one big script that all the participants in the story were reading ahead of time, so each one knows exactly the role of the others..Couldn't finish it. Got up to page 150 ,and gave up. I tried to anticipate what the ending would be. Skipped to the last paragraph, and sure enough . It ended the way I thought it would. No surprises.Save your money.I felt the same reading another of Davids book, but decided to give him another chance.Now I just erased him from my to read list."
3,An average predictable action book,"What a coincidence that Kirk McGravey, the hero of this novel has an ex-wife(Kathline),a brat tom-boy daughter(Elizabeth), a female spy-lover(Jaquelin) and a computer-freak friend(Otto). I have read many action novel and this seems to be the pattern that most authors follow. I think that what made me read the novel to its end was just to see if Kirk would do something outrageously different, or to see if Chernov or Tarankov would surrender.(I forgot Liesl, the bi-sexual female) Nevertheless, the novel is full of action, suspense and international cat- and-mouse chase. A true thriller"
5,Fast paced and action packed! Kirk McGarvey is back!,"Alongside of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt, Hagberg's Kirk McGarvey is one of my favorite reoccuring characters in suspense thrillers. Assassin reaquaints us with old friends and new enemies and the result is another action packed thriller! The plot is well constructed and the characters are well developed. Hagberg deserves a place amongst the Clancy's, Ludlum's and Cussler's...he is definitely one of the best kept secrets in the genre! But if continues to put out more books like this it won't be long before the secret is out!!"
1,Exploding Eggwave - Fun with your kids and a microwave,"We bought the Egg Wave as a way to make quick scrambled eggs, personalized with each picky eaters preference of add-ins. When making eggs scrambled in the Egg Wave, they oftentimes EGGGGSPLODDDDDE! I still do it once in a while just for the pure joy it brings my kids, although I have to clean up all the mess afterward. To the cats and puppy go the spoils! :o)"
1,"Run, don't walk....away from this turkey!","This game may have been mildly amusing if it hadn't been so incredibly boring. The lack of an option to save the game during a level instead of between levels only is a dead giveaway that this is nothing more than a lame console port.Sure, the weapons may be original and fun, but all you get to do is shoot turkeys, turkeys, and more turkeys. Oh, and a cow or two. That's it. No way to explore the wonderful world of South Park in this strictly linear waste of time. I would have liked to do the mulitiplayer, but I couldn't bring myself to try to get my friends to buy it-I want them to stay friends!After all the hype about understanding the difference between PC gamers and console gamers, Acclaim's release of this poorly-done port was almost criminal."
3,More fun if your a South Park fan.,"I played this game years ago on the 64. Just picked it up for the hell of it. Still fun but would be better to play multiplayer on the 64 or playstation. Unless of course you have multiple people that have it on pc because you can play multiplayer online. In that case, it would be just fine. The game is old and doesn't compare to the new games, but sometimes it's fun to go back and play the old stuff."
1,Theory of Evolution Taught,"After reading this book, as tempted as I was to buy it because I ADORE Burton's books and illustrations, I decided not to buy this book. We are a Bible believing family. We believe the scriptures clearly teach the origins and founding of the BEGINNING of LIFE. So, as a parent, if you buy this book, you must just decide what world view you want to teach your child. Did they come from sludge and by chance, (billions of years ago? Scriptures teach of a much younger existence) or are we created on purpose, with a purpose, by a loving Creator. Just my two cents by a mother of four. I feel the younger years are the most important so what we allow our children to read, no matter how sentimental or awesome the illustrations are, will form in their hearts and minds how they view themselves (do I have worth?) and the world they live in."
5,Mexico at its best!,"Just bough this DVD and love it. Music isnt the best, but killer footage and a lot of action. Shows people getting demolished by waves quite a bit if you like that. Awesome reef breaks, minimal talking and maximum surfing!"
5,Excellent surfing video,This has a nice mix of travel and excellent surfing. It's almost worth it just to see the 30 second tube ride Cory Lopez got at Puerto Escondido.
2,"Great idea, poor execution...","The idea of this set is fantastic, and the book enclosed is a great resource about spatial configuration and architecture. However, the stamps are extremely sub-par. Too petite and of a very low quality plastic, they do not pick up the ink well. Over half of the stamps in my set were warped, rendering them useless.I would not recommend this set, and am extremely glad I tested mine before giving it as a gift."
4,Can't Put This Fire Out,"Funky horn-driven soul from the masters. This is a short album, but it doesn't disappoint - from the subversive strutting on the title track to the low-down beaten-dog crying on ""Mean Mistreater,"" the Bar-Kays show off their talents at arranging and performing complex orchestrations of party funk. Check out the originals."
4,The Amadeus Book of the Violin,"While the book isn't, in parts, a real page turner, it is a thorough survey of violin information. With 250 pages on construction and history of violin making, it brings to light much important and interesting information. It really makes clear the unique market that violin buying-selling is and gives historical reasons for this unique market.Overall, a necessity for the violin lover."
3,Barely Adequate,This book was written by someone who thought very highly of himself but padded what little real information he knew with loads of extraneous fluff that had on bearing on the subject.
5,These songs can make everyday Christmas,"Form the first time I heard this CD. And heard many church choir doing ""The Lamb of God"". I knew that this CD would be a special one.This CD is one that you should have in your collection. All of the songs on this CD, is worth having. From ""Silent Night"" to the last song ""Silver & Gold - Remix"" can be played each and every day. That is why I say, ""These songs can make everyday Christmas"" Give it a listen, and You'll see what I mean."
3,Christmas,"I normally turn away from listening to alot of the Kirk Franklin recordings. However, during choir rehersal, one of the members decided to introduce the song, 'Now Behold the Lamb'. Now that's gospel music - and to the glory of God I sing!"
5,Gospel Must Have,"This is a Gospel Christmas Music ""Must Have"". Buy it for yourself and also make it a much appreciated gift for others."
5,Precious!,"I have the book, and wanted to see the video. Definitely a great kids video and I'm anxious to share it with my grandchildren!"
5,Excellent Movie,The children loved this movie. They were very into the movie and paid attention throughout the entire movie. They had seen the movie before and wanted to own a copy of it. Excellent nature shots with talking animals. Excellent video of the various animals. Clear pictures of the animals for people who do not live in a rural setting. Good music. Children wanted to go feed the deer after the movie. So we did!
1,Major American author in a cheap suit,"I am a lifelong Faulkner fan and an ardent book collector. I have an extensive collection of Faulkner's novels in hardcover. (The Library of America series volumes, for example, are elegantly made, carefully edited, and affordable.) Curiously, a well-made,hardbound copy of Faulkner's collected short stories is hard to come by, so I hopefully ordered this edition. It's a total disappointment. While it is, technically speaking, ""hardcover,"" it is flimsy and cheaply done. The pages are poorly reproduced and the paper is only a baby step above newsprint, while the binding is so feeble, it barely survived the unpacking. I'll continue my search for a good edition of Faulkner's collected stories; in the meantime this one will probably suffice as long as I don't actually try to read it."
4,A Rose for Emily,"This short story is twisted, but that's why it's so great. The story is dark and gloomy, but it is really interesting. A Rose for Emily recounts the story of an eccentric spinster, Emily Grierson. An unnamed narrator details the strange circumstances of Emily's life and her odd relationships with her father, who controlled and manipulated her, and her lover, the Yankee road worker Homer Barron. When Homer Barron threatens to leave her, she is seen buying arsenic, which the townspeople believe she will commit suicide with. Faulkner based the story upon a true incident. The rose indeed was for his friend, Emily Grierson. In the story, the townspeople's points of views on Emily actually reflect the society's value at that moment to some extent. Emily feels that she is released when her father is dead.However, I do not recommend this book if you might get scared easily. The ending might come as a surprise, but that's suspense. Go read it, if you like it a bit twisted."
4,"Some great, some meh","This collection of Faulkner stories is a really mixed bag. I generally liked the Yoknapatawpha County stories best, and the ones that are connected (Two Soldiers and Shall Not Perish, and the Indian stories) are especially good. Some of his more famous ones like ""A Rose for Emily"" are actually the least interesting to me. They feel more like O. Henry trick endings and I know Faulkner has more in him.Some of the stories are very confusing on the first read, but I think they make more sense the second time, and Faulkner at his best really should be reread.If you want a more consistent (and connected) collection of Faulkner tales, try ""Knight's Gambit"" or ""Go Down, Moses."""
3,excellent stories; average edition,"I have always wanted to get a hardcover edition of these stories. Faulkner is one of my favourite writers and these collection of his stories is superb but... Vintage Int. could have published a more decent edition: the binding is poor and the quality of the paper is not adequate for this type of edition. At least, it was not advertised as a ""deluxe edition""."
5,The Tastiest Faulkner Buffet,This collection opened my heart to the short story. Anyone who loves Faulkner will love the collected stories. Real insight into the Yoknapatawpha history.
3,Elly was my favorite,"It took me 9 weeks, but I finally worked my way through each of the stories in this collection. My favorite, hands down, was Elly, which I read and re-read, read aloud to my husband, went online to look up background information, read again, made my friends read ... yeah, it was that good. Other stories here, however, were so very difficult to understand that I'm not sure I can say I actually read them, or merely read the words - one after another."
1,WOW! I'm impressed too Rudy!,"I'm impressed that so many people have shown so much interest in a poorly written book about a conman who basically got lucky and most people today have never heard of, unless they come to Amazon.com or Ebay and read the inflated stories or go to their local used bookstore and find this wierd and wacky looking book on sale for .50 cents or less.Why so many people taking the time to review a book that never even got much attention when it was new? Check the internet. Resellers are trying to peddle this garbage and obviously trying to promote it by mixing 5 star reviews and then 1 star reviews. Then check Ebay and look at the ""wierd and wacky"" vinyl records recorded by this ex-conman and look what they are selling for today. Even the sellers say they can't understand a word he says.People will do anything for money eh Rudy? By the way, what is Glenn Turner up to these days anyway? I am sure you will know."
1,Small book - not even worth $1.25,"First of all, interested readers should be made aware that this is not the same educational type DARE TO BE GREAT books that are out by great writers like Cameron and Kreuger. You won't find any information in this tome on how to be great at anything.Instead of being educational, this book is about an apparent ripoff company called Dare To Be Great from the 70's. According to author Rudy Maxa, the founder and CEO Glenn W. Turner cheated thousands out of $44 million+ with an apparent illegal pyramid scheme called DARE TO BE GREAT.Judging by the reviews here, Turner apparently had a lot of fans and supporters. In any event, I found this book worthless and not even worth the $1.25 it was selling for at a used book store. The book is small and has no useful content."
3,Tony Rome 1967,"When the beautiful daughter of a prominent businessman is found drunk and unconscious in a hotel room , private detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinata 1915-1998) , is hired to avert scandal by escorting her home . The next day , however , the girl's diamond pin is mysteriously missing , and thugs ransack Rome's houseboat in hopes of locating it. To top it all , Rome discovers his ex-partner dead in his office . One of Sinatra's most exiciting screen roles , TONY ROME also features Richard Conte (1910-1975) , Jill St.John (1940 - ) , Sue Lyon (1946 - ) and Gena Rowlands (1930 - ) . High Quality Transfer ."
3,And he doesn't want to work that hard again. Never!,"Kick back and watch Frank ruffle some feathers among the bad guys, and a few of the good ones in one of his favorite playgrounds (besides Vegas, Palm Springs, New York, Monte Carlo), Miami. Lots of nice scenery, particularly the feminine type, and lots of action with snappy comebacks. One note about the film's score by Billy May, where an earlier poster said it sounded like it was lifted from ""Batman"" in the 60's. You're half right. Right around this time, Billy May was doing the music for ""The Green Hornet"" series, and the music here is closer to that show, which was also produced by 20th Century Fox. Billy would later work on Batman's third season, replacing Nelson Riddle.The DVD looks good, with lots of trailers of films I used to watch on the 4:30 movie after school (chopped to ribbons, of course). And what's wrong with ""Fathom""?? For what it was, nothing that I could see."
4,Sinatra as PI,"Tony Rome is one of Sinatra's best underrated performances.He is a Miami PI hired by a millionaire to do clean up when the rich man daughter is found in a hotel room. This turns into a dead ex partner in Rome's office.Rome is a hardboiled detective like Phillip Marlowe or Spenser style. Rome could have been a great series for Frank, however only one sequal Lady in Cement was made...too bad. This fast paced movie was witty and slick. With Sinatra in the driver's seat, you know you are watching a winnerBennet Pomerantz , AUDIOWORLD"
4,Freudean Enneagram,"Excellent review with a Freudean twist of the ""Seven Deadly + 2 Sins"". Was hoping for more insight of the underlying processes inherent in the Enneagram symbol that Gurdjieff, Bennett, Ouspensky and Vollmer discuss and how that relates to traversing the Enneagon."
3,Controversial Theories Versus Accepted Logic,"Robert Paddle's controversial book, The Last Tasmanian Tiger, attempts to overturn most previously accepted anecdotal reasoning on a subject that is fast becoming popular world wide. Paddle has rather recklessly thrown caution to the wind in his sometimes dangerous dismantilling of sound anecdotal evidence, replacing it with his own logic, which is in many cases sadly wide of the mark. The Last Tasmanian Tiger could prove to be a dangerous book in the wrong hands, for it could lead astray those tender souls genuinely seeking information of this unique creature. Being pro-scientific as it is, Paddle's book is written in a style that can be hard to decipher for us mere mortals. But, all this aside, Paddle has done a tremendous ammount of research in assembling his book, some of it ground breaking, and from this point alone it makes worthwhile reading. The Last Tasmanian Tiger is definitely not suitable for the novice thylacine enthusiast."
1,Mush Mouse,"The best song on this cd is ""I've Got You Babe"" which has Bobby as lead singer. Not to discredit James's vocal ability as a lead singer but he's too nasal to sing lead. I feel that most of these songs should have had either Bobby or Randy as the lead off singers with a mixture of all the brothers doing background. Mark has a very nice voice also but i like him so much better as a background singer."
4,Good read...Great memories,"Anyone who fondly remembers the ""Miracle On Ice"" will find this book to be an enjoyable walk down memory lane of the greatest sports event in the history of the United States. The author's unique storytelling intertwines the play-by-play of the semi-final game between the USA and USSR with the individual stories of the game's major ""characters.""The story of the game and circumstances surrounding that time in US history has been told so many times, that many of the tales in the book are familiar but the author keeps it interesting. He also provides more insight into the Soviet team and its background than I've ever previously encountered. The only dissapointment for me was the lack of attention to the other games that the United States played during its Olympic run."
3,USA! USA! USA!,"I can still hear the chants. Still feel the excitement. Still remember where I was, on the day a group of little known athletes beat the worlds best to move on to the gold medal game.Mr. Coffey does a good job of bringing those moments back, although his concentration is soley on the one game itself.A nice glimpse into those involved....both prior, during and since that momentous night (afternoon).I enjoyed his job of retelling the event, although I have to admit, I popped ""Miracle"" into the DVD player about half way through the book in order to get a quick fix.All in all.....a quick read and a nice way to bring those memories back to the surface."
5,great book documenting a great event,"I don't usually like sports books, so even though I'd been dying to get this book, I was a bit skeptical about reading it. But Wayne Coffey made this book exciting, interesting, and so enjoyable to read (and I thank him for not using too many hard-to-understand words!). I loved reading all of the players' individual stories, and even though I only recently got into hockey after seeing Miracle, I was able to follow the game descriptions as well. I recommend anyone who knows and loves the story to read this book, because I have grown so close to this story in such a short time, and I love this book even more."
3,Not as good as the original,"I had extremely high hopes for this album, after their fantastic old-school debut, ""Turn Yourself Around."" Unfortunately, they only managed to deliver about 1/2 the time on this album. Even so, when they do hit, they do it well, especially on the opening song that features the Gospel Gangstaz as a guest artist.It's certainly not ""Turn Yourself Around,"" but it's not too shabby in it's own right. They still rap with that old school style they are known for, but the background tracks are a little more modern."
5,Best Syrup at the Best Prize!,"After using Torani Syrup for the lattes made at home, I no longer have to spend $4 for a latte drink. The Torani Vanilla Syrup is the best in the Market!"
1,"Cheap, waste of time.","Stopped working after 2 months. Besides that, magnet is weak and small, so forget about pressing the buttons while still attached to any vertical metal surface."
5,Love it!,"This item appears to be high quality. It does exactly what I want it to do, and appears that it will be able to do that for a long time. It was a great price. I love the big numbers. I don't know what else I can say. I would buy it again if I ever lose this one. It's magnetic so it sticks to my fridge, and can auto-repeat an amount of time after the initial timer goes off and you hit stop -- I like that. It's also white, so it matches my fridge. The magnet is strong."
2,It does the job.,I needed a small timer to help in baking cookies. It does the job okay. I have to take the batteries out after using it because it starts again. Guess I will save on batteriers.
3,Digial Timer,"Even though its main function is accomplished well, setting it up is boring for long runs: if I want to set a timer of 90 minutes, I push the Minutes button until I reach 90, but for a second run, there is no a memory function, so I have to start over."
1,another worthless product,Alarm so anemic as to render the unit unfit for it's purpose.Even in my shirt pocket it could be overlooked in a noisy environment.Too much trouble to return
2,Not as advertised,"The only reason I bought this timer was because it was supposed to be loud, it is no louder than my old one, I have everything turned off in my place and I can't hear it from 7 feet away, so I am stuck with a silent alarm!"
5,Works well for my kids,I have two grade school kids (11 yo & 8 yo) with timed reading requirements. They like the easy to use buttons. We have carpeted & hardwood floors. They have been knocked onto both floors. So far so good. Sound is good & not obnoxious. We're happy with our purchase.
4,Basic and good,"This is a nicely designed timer that is simple to operate. It counts up. It counts down. It beeps at the end. It has A big clear display.What more could you want? More time - that's what. It only has 99 minutes so if you're doing a 2 1/2 hour roast anything, you'll be resetting at least once. That's why the 4 star rating, and not 5."
5,Gets the job done in time!,"As other has said, its not super loud... but its perfectly fine. I can hear it in the near by room to my kitchen with the TV running. Its nice big display lets me see it from far away with out have to walk up close."
3,Beeps too much,"I dislike how it beeps every time you click a button or even when you hold the button down. So if you hold the button down and set it to 90 minutes, it'll beep 90 times which is grating.Bad on me for not paying closer attention to the description as it does mention a limit of 100 minutes but that's the other reason I'll be returning this. I need it to go higher than 1 hour and 40 minutes."
1,Dubious Quality?,"I've bought this product twice; the item both times reaching the same end....Upon replacing with new battery (as 'alarm-tone' dimmed), the digital readout screen went blank, never to return to it's normal use!Each time it only lasted sev mos (light usage!).....While working, it's an extremely versatile & convenient item (for: workouts, cooking etc.)...One simply doesn't get their money's worth!!!"
3,Not LOUD enough,I guess you shouldn't believe ANY description written for Amazon.It's no louder than the timer it was supposed to replace!Update: 2/12 I suppose the sound level isn't as low as I first thought but it still does not match the description. Under promise and over deliver please.
2,Almost Silent,"After reading reviews in search of a timer that actually works (who would think it would be that difficult in this age of technological wonders to find a cheap one that lasts a while) I thought this was it. I was bitterly disappointed when I had to hold it up to my ear to hear the beep! I'm not hard of hearing and a reasonably sounding beep would have been quite acceptable. However, even my dog didn't pay any attention to this! Other than that, it works fine."
2,"Works fine, except.....","This timer is fine except it is not loud enough for me. I will miss the alarm most of the time. If a mouse farts while the alarm is going off, it will drown out the alarm. Other than that, its simple, decent magnet and nice size."
2,Works well until you get it even slightly damp,"My title says it: this item works very well until you get so much as a drop or two of water on it. It will then cease to work at all. Casual or occasional cooks will probably find this an excellent timer. But if you have an active kitchen, with one or more people cooking at once, and several things being made at once, you will probably find, as I have, that it is impossible to keep the timer absolutely bone-dry. I've gone through three of these. They work well for a time, and then they stop working. Personally, I recommend an old-fashioned mechanical timer."
1,Not Loud Enough,"I bought this primarily because it was advertised as LOUD . . . at least loud enough to hear beyond the kitchen. The beep is inaudible if there is any other ambient sound (TV, music, traffic, even A/C). My bedroom alarm clock is louder than this thing. Not very expensive, so not worth the bother of returning. The display and the count-up feature are nice, but what good is a kitchen timer you can't hear!"
1,Nice design but has reliability issues,"I bought 3 of these and feel that the large digits, magnetized back, stand and rear eye hook are great design features.2 of the 3 have since malfunctioned in the past year I've owned them. The first stopped issuing beeps after about 6 months of use so I could not be alerted whenever a countdown ended. The second unit's display just blanked out after 8 months of use. The third one is still going strong.So while it's a great little package, I'm afraid I can't recommend this timer because of its reliability problems."
3,Loud? Not.,"I bought this timer because it is advertised as LARGE and LOUD. I must agree that the display is large and easy to read from across the kitchen. But this timer is NOT loud. It can be heard in the kitchen. But from another part of the house, not a chance, especially if there is any noise (radio, TV or kids) elsewhere. If you move from the kitchen, you'd better take the timer with you, or you'll miss its beeper, which only runs for 60 seconds, then it shuts off. At least it counts UP from there, so you'll know how long you've overcooked your food.Why can't timers have a really LOUD electronic alarm, not just a crappy little beeper? Cell phones ring loud enough to wake the dead. At least print the decibel level on the package."
2,Stopped working after several month of use,"I was happy with functionality, but after several month display started not displaying all digit parts. 0 was like 7 and after several weeks more it stop working at all."
2,got what I paid for....,"Would I order another one? Nope, not even if someone else paid for it.Timer works, with an ""OK"" buzzer. It's a pain to reset. Very sorry I bought this."
2,Wouldn't buy this timer again,"Wouldn't buy this timer (CDN TM15)again, no off switch. The only way to power off the timer is to remove the battery. Poor design."
1,Unhappy Consumer,"The first - and only time I used it, it worked great. When I tried to use it again, no matter what I did - no dice. I could not get it to come on. I did follow all directions. I even tried changing the battery - first thing I did. I would NOT recommend this timer to anyone. I then came back to Amazon.com and purchased the old fashioned timer that you just turn the handle to set time. The one with the long ring. To my happy surprise they came in colors so I bought one for myself and one for my best friend and now we are both very happy"
2,mediocre,Not easy to set timer. Alarm is not very loud.You can only set timer for one hour.Good point it has nice large numbers.
1,I bought 4 ... one of them broke within 3 weeks,"I bought four of these timers.Now three weeks later, one of them has stopped working.It is locked up and confused. Removing and reinstalling the battery did not help."
3,So so,"It beeps every time you push a button.There's no way to turn it off.I wanted a timer to carry around in my pocket, but the buttons get pressed and it beeps which is annoying."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this timer to use while student teaching in order to time my students for reading and math fluency. I was able to use this a total of 2 times before the numbers magically disappeared. For a couple more uses I was able to try and guess that I was putting in the correct amount of time before it started acting erratically. I wish I would have noticed the 30+ 1 Star reviews prior to buying this product. I will not buy this product again in the future!
1,Big Disappointment - Dead in Under 2 Months,"I loved the design of this timer; it was so simple, both easy to use and to see. The alarm was also a good balance between being loud enough to hear but not ear piercing. I'd had it for about a month when the magnet fell off. My husband was able to fix that, though it was disappointing that it happened so soon.Today, the timer simply died. It started turning itself off and on at random. I watched it for a while to make sure I wasn't going crazy. It really did turn itself back on and would turn off when it was ready, not when I pushed the stop button. I placed the order on 18 January, so I've had this timer for less than two months and the thing is ready for the trash heap! We use timers often around the house, and this is by far the shortest lived one I've had."
1,Dropped once and broke,"I loved the timer at first, but I dropped it from waist height once and it broke. It no longer makes the beeping noise, and once the timer has hit zero, it starts counting down again and never stops. So sad because I was really excited about this timer."
5,Perfect for my classroom,"I teach Kindergarten, and I needed a visual timer that the students could use to pace themselves through their work (and to know when a break is coming). This timer is perfect because of its large size! I love that this timer can countdown from a specific number of minutes/seconds and also it can time how long something takes. It is magnetic, but it also comes with a stand that you can prop up to set it on a table. I love this timer so much that now I've bought four of them and I have them in different places all over my classroom. Other teachers at school have also seen them in my room and bought them! Great product."
2,Could not get the timer to work,"The timer kept going up and down with both set of the numbers superimposed over each other, which was a muddled mess. I felt the directions were not to clear as a tool for instruction. I am returning the item."
2,"Big Numbers, Big Buttons","PRO: This is exactly as advertised. It had huge numbers and is very easy to set, reset and turn off the chime.My only CON and it's a big one for me: If you put this in a bag, pocket, purse, or anywhere the huge buttons can come in contact with anything, its starts a countdown to an alarm. Would be perfect if it had a master on/off button on the back."
1,Can hardly hear the alarm.,"The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it.The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it.The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it."
1,Broke after 1 day....,"I used this three times, and then it stopped working. First the buttons stopped working, then it started beeping constantly. I would return it but I had already thrown away the packaging. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,screen difficult to read,"Despite the large digits, this timer is extremely difficult to read because the background LCD display to create the numbers remains visible whatever number is being shown. For example, for example, if a number is 5, it is hard to distingish it from an 8 becuase the vertical lines to the bottom left and top right still remain significantly visible. Would not purchase this product again."
3,excellent timer... but requires super glue,"I used the timer for the first time this afternoon. The display is large, it is easy to set (and re-set), and the beep is loud without being offensive. I also liked that it started counting UP so I knew how long since it first started going off. However, due to the placement of the magnet, when I had the timer on the fridge door and went to stop the timer, it fell to the ground, leaving the magnet no longer attached. Can I fix it? Absolutely. Will I? Probably. Is it a hassle nonetheless? Yup. Very disappointed in an otherwise wonderful purchase."
4,Good one!,"The big numbers are very helpful! I've used it while working on the computer so I don't got over my intended time, and it is super easy to glance my eyes over and see the time remaining. Also good for the kids brushing their teeth. Ringer is loud enough and the timer's feature is easy to use and figure out."
1,magnet didn't stay on,the magnet didn't stay on - i glued it 2ce until it fell of and broke- waste of money but besides that i loved it and wished they made a better one.
1,Numbers disappear due to humidity,"Pros: I find the numbers easy to read; the alarm is sufficiently loud to hear about 30 ft away; easy to set.Con: Numbers disappear apparently due to humidity.I received this timer about a month ago. Numbers were visible for the first few days. Then part of the numbers disappeared and it became impossible to set the time. After a week or so, the numbers came back when the %humidity dropped into the 40's. Once humidity moved up into the 50's, the numbers partially disappeared again.My recommendation is to buy a timer other than this CDN which is a piece of junk. I found a Taylor timer which is difficult to set but that also works as a clock and is quite reliable regardless of the humidity. Later I found a Lux Minute Minder which is excellent. All the nice features of the CDN AND the numbers are readable regardless of the humidity (lately we've had 80% humidity for several days.)"
4,"Simple, but it works.","My only complaint with this device is that there is no way to adjust the volume when it rings. Otherwise, it works fine."
2,broke the first time it fell of the fridge,I have had timers that last years and take the abuse of a busy cook. This timer broke the first time it fell of the fridge. It should handle more then one crash.
2,Stopped working after 5 months,"The seconds display started dropping out after about 4 months (The 0's started to look like 7's.) It was still usable for the most part, but now at the 5-month mark, the seconds display has almost completely dropped out and it no longer keeps time. When I purchased it I did not realize that there is no on/off switch. I would not recommend this timer."
2,"Cheaply built, not durable, but nice while it lasted.","This is a nice, large-displayed, very basic timer. The alert is sort of subdued, non-jarring, not loud as a klaxon, which may or may not be attractive to you. I had problems with my timer. It suddenly started malfunctioning and then stopped working altogether. I took it apart, and found a wire that had come unmoored from the circuit board. I've seen some cheap circuit boards, but this one took the cake: it was wafer-thin and flimsy-looking. I re-soldered the wire the gauge of which was about as thick as a human hair, barely an exaggeration! The unit functioned for a year or so after the repair before it began to go off spontaneously and all digits would intermittently display ""8888"", so I popped the battery and trashed it. I liked the timer, but the poor reliability and build quality would prevent me from recommending it to anybody."
4,Where is the on/off switch?,"I love everything about this timer: The large display, the loud alarm, the ease of use, etc.This timer is only missing one thing: an on/off switch.The battery is constantly running and the 0:00 display is being burned into the screen.Hopefully someone will wake up and fix this."
1,Screen stopped working!!!,"I was hoping that this timer would be what I was looking for: a big digital readout that can be seen from a distance and a loud alarm. However, after using it only once, most of the LCD screen stopped working, rendering the timer unusable. The timer looked promising, but sure failed the quality test."
1,Did not work at all - useless,The display did not work - a liquid mess of pixels.Threw it in the garbage 3 minutes after unpacking. Totally useless.Perhaps it was a faulty unit but I did not even bother returning it.
1,Loud & Long; is a Joke / WARNING,"The first one did not have a sound at all, called Amazon they sent a 2nd one Immediately, and I expected it would work, not exactly, a slight sound emerges but not loud enough to hear unless next to my ear, and I have good hearing, I can hear a truck pulling a grade about 2 miles from my home at night.I have burnt so many loaves of good homemade bread, by going to another room, a timer that gives me a warning is a necessity. I'm disappointed but returning the second one.Now, to Target or Walmart to buy one that I can listen to before leaving the store.If you don't want sound this might be just the ticket for you the price is right. But they make such an issue of the LOUD alarm in this description it's only a ONE STAR in my book."
3,timer,"WEll, when I first got it I was thrilled about this Amazon purchased timer. But lately the buzzer doesn't go off when the timer is down to zero...so now what good is it?"
3,VERY FRAGILE,"I love this basic timer except that it is very fragile. We're on our third CDN TM15 timer in less than a year.- I dropped one onto our kitchen tile counter top from about 18-inches up and it stopped working. The display went completely blank. I checked the batteries but no luck.- My wife bumped one off the side of our refrigerator (stuck on with it's magnet) onto the tile counter top from about a foot up. The screen cracked over the minutes and 10-minutes digits and they no longer display.While it's our fault that the timer stopped working, I wish this thing would withstand a little more than a one foot drop.I'm looking for another comparable timer but one that is a little less fragile."
4,Beware moisture or humidity,"This thing is great, at least until the LCD digits started disappearing. I'm keeping it in the bathroom and apparently the moisture from the shower has gotten into it somehow. It lost 4 segments from the one-seconds place and 3 segments from the ten-seconds place, so far. It's an interesting mental exercise to look at the segments showing and figure out what numbers they might represent, but I'd rather just have a working screen. The timing circuit still works perfectly though. For the price, I'm not really complaining."
3,"Nice, but broke easily by being bumped off the fridge.","I really like this timer. It's simple to use, nice big numbers, and loud. I've had it for a couple months. My boyfriend bumped it off the fridge, and even though it didn't land too hard on the floor, it's broken. The screen cracked and turned all black."
2,SHORT LIFE,I bought this one June 2011 and dead September 2012.It was nice and big to handle. A magnet on the back is convenient.But dead so soon.
4,Works well enough,"I was used tomy old one but am getting used to this one now. It does the job and is easy to use, and easy on the eyes. Get one."
5,Great timer,"This was perfect for what I needed. Nothing fancy but does what it's supposed to. When the time runs out from whatever time you set it for, the alarm goes off."
1,AWFUL!!,"This stop watch has a big screen, but no on/off switch, so you have to remove the battery to turn it off. It worked for a few days and then died for no apparent reason. I had to send it back. I would not recomment it at all."
2,Timer not as described,"The timer functions OK, but the description is deceptive. This does NOT have a pocket clip as the description says, so if you're buying it to carry around the house with you, it won't be very useful. I also agree with the others in that the lack of an ""off"" switch, without having to take out the battery, is rather annoying."
1,Loud and Long? - a cruel hoax,"I purchased this timer because I needed a loud tone. I found this specific item by googling ""loud kitchen timer"". It arrived today. I installed the battery and tested it. What a disappointment. I could barely hear the alarm tone in a silent room with it sitting on the desk directly in front of me. If you move away from the kitchen while cooking, or even if you remain in the same room and run some water, or have any other background noise, you will never hear the wimpy bleating of this so called ""Loud and Long"" timer when it goes off. It seems to perform all other functions well enough, but be prepared for scorched pots and pans if you are depending on this to audibly notify you of a completed cooking time. I rated it a one due to badly misleading and false advertising."
5,CDN timer,"The best timer by far I have used. Totally intuitive controls, good device build quality, and clearly audible alarm."
3,Nice big numbers,"The numbers are big, and it keeps time well, and I've had it for about a month and it still works. We use it for timing things for my 3 year old. I wish that it went up higher than 99 minutes, but we still use it all the time for the smaller amounts of time. It has a nice loud beep, but it stops after one minute. As soon as the alarm starts it starts to count upwards. Battery is a AAA."
5,"Works well. Very well designed. I would buy this one again, for sure!","This timer is exactly as I expected. I use it in my classroom. It has a magnet, stand and hanging loop. The stand and loop are very well designed. I can hit the stop button without the timer popping off the whiteboard (this is a big deal). I did accidentally drop the timer on the hard floor and the magnet propped off (the glue failed). I have to super glue it back on.If you are getting a kitchen timer, I HIGHLY recommend getting one with an integrated oven thermometer. We've had an ACU RITE one for almost 12 years in our kitchen."
2,"This is NOT loud, despite the advertising to the contrary","I purchased this timer because the description said that that alarm is long and LOUD. What a disappointment! This is not loud at all. It's not even as loud as the cheap timers I've picked up at the dollar store. It's going back today...5 minutes after opening the package. It is DEFINITELY NOT worth the money, although I do like the large numbers. You can see them from across the room, which is helpful when you are trying to do several things at once while you are cooking."
4,"Magnet could be much bigger, but perfect timer.","I agree with a few other reviewers, that the magnet is pretty dang small.I run a letterpress print shop, and can hear this timer go off over my printing machines. I particularly like the fact that the timer, once reaching zero, starts counting upwards until you come shut it off. Lets you know how much over you've been timing.But the tiny magnet is way too small. I might Gorilla glue a larger magnet on the back.EDIT: 2 years later, the text is still readable, but the beeper sounds like it's on it's last legs. Great little unit for $7.00"
5,Big Digit Timer,This is the best timer I have ever owned! And with the magnet on the back it's right where I need it by the stove.
4,nice timer,"I would give it 5 stars but it doesn't beep very loud. I would like to be able to hear it if I'm in the livingroom, 2 rooms away. I still like it. The time restarts after the set time runs out so you know how long it's been beeping, which is pretty neat."
3,NOT loud enough to be heard in another room,"I bought this timer because the Product Feature said: ""Loud alarm can be heard in another part of the house"". I'm lucky to hear it across the room. I like the large display and the button operation has been okay so far. The Product feature says: ""Pocket clip, magnet, and stand allow multiple uses"". I just use the magnet. The pocket clip and stand look so cheap, like they'd break right off if you tried to use them."
4,Good digital timer,"Inexpensive digital timer. Alarm, while not ear splitting, stays on for a full minute. MInutes continue to be recorded after countdown to zero. Not sure why.It has definitely replaced my older mechanical timer."
3,Good timer,"It's a pretty good timer, but the ringing sound is a little too low. You'll just have to carry it around with you in the house to be able to hear it."
2,Would not purchase again...,"My husband purchased this timer for me. It is very easy to use and worked great for a short period of time. It only worked about 6 months before it started to become unreliable. I put a new battery in it and it still acts strange. It clears out when you are pressing minutes. It starts to count down before you are finished putting in the time. It only beeps a few times when the time is up, so you may not hear it if you stepped away for a second. I would not recommend this timer."
1,Do not buy this!,"This timer was totally dead in less than a month !!!!!!Do not buy this product !!!!!I tried every AAA battery out there and it was still a flat line !!!!I am so let down buy this product !!!!!,"
3,A Loudness index is needed.,I have purchased several kitchen timers claiming to have a loud alarm and have always been disappointed. The desciption for this timer says it can be heard in another room. I could barely hear it from a couple of feet away and my hearing is normal. Descriptions of loudness should be required to give a decibel level.
4,very good!!,"Works well and we will not forget something that we are timing. One thing I would hope is that the increase of timing will jump 5 mins after a long hold down, so it will go to 99 mins faster. I like the number is big and clear. Easy operate. My mom is very happy about this timer over the old turning ones that you never know if it is ticking right."
4,Digital timer large format,The timer works great and can be viewed from well across the room. The only drawback is you cannot simply enter the time you want to select and must punch the minute button until you reach the correct about of time.
2,Buzzer Not Loud Enough,"This is a good standard basic timer that can be used in the kitchen and elsewhere, but for me, the timer buzzer is so soft that I can't hear it if I'm not within a foot of the timer, and even then it's very weak. So, it's basically useless to me."
4,Nice Timer,"This is a good timer, however it's not at all loud enough for hearing challenged people.. The frequency is too high for those with hearing loss.For those with normal hearing, you'll be satisfied."
5,Love this little timer,"Isn't it funny how tiny conveniences make for simple, pleasant daily life? I was using the timer on my microwave or on the stove which I could never hear well enough from my office or the laundry room or the garden or wherever. It was just plain annoying. Now when I need to know when to stir the soup or take out the bread I just set this timer, pop it in my pocket and take it along with me wherever I go. I love that I can use the easel to set it on a table or desk or use the magnet to put it on the fridge if I'm in the kitchen. With the large display the numbers are easy to see at a glance from across the room. I also like the feature it has of counting up. It's good to know how long a certain task takes to accomplish. I don't know why I waited so long to get this. It's such a small thing but it's made my life so much easier."
5,Extra hings to know about it,"With the idea that everything with this would be simple and obvious, I did not notice for a while that there were more options for using it than laying it down or using the magnet (which, of course, fails on stainless). The easel and hook on the back escaped my notice for a while. As did the fact that it keeps counting after starting to beep so you know how late you are.However, I would not call the alarm Extra Loud. It's OK but not Extra."
2,Another Van Daniken or Sitchin!,If you are fan of Eric Van Daniken then you may like this. I did not. He compared Jesus to ancient gods and I felt belittled Him.
1,Confusing - Extremely Hard to Follow,"I am extremely disappointed in this book. The sample applications that were used in this book showed great promise as they pertained to exactly to the project that I purchased this book for in the first place, but the instructions and examples where just poorly implimented. The visual aspect of this book seemed to jump around too much. It was often hard to find all the code examples that I was supposed to enter for the sample applications to execute them. 90% of the time the application would not run, most likely because I missed a portion of code that I was supposed to enter. In some cases it seemed like the code sections for the sample applications were in the wrong order, adding details to classes when they were not even defined until the following page or 2. If I could give this 0 stars I would."
1,Build Errors A Plenty Half Baked Book,"So far a frustrating experience with this book.The on-line ""help"" is non-existant and the source filesare half baked. So, far nothing runs for me. Disjointed code and writing."
3,Not for web development...,"Although I usually enjoy this series of books I didn't like this one and quickly returned it. It is definitely not for beginners and seems to be all over the place without any particular logical flow. It doesn't appear to be well thought out and really has very little ASP.NET inside it. The author mentions this is a book to teach the C# language and the choices to bring the lesson across were command line, windows or web programs. The author chose web (ASP.NET) yet doesn't teach much at all about ASP.NET. If you want to learn C# this book is not horrible but there are many others much better that this. If you wan't to learn ASP.NET using C# do yourself a favor and buy Programming ASP.NET by Oreilly."
2,Not written very well,"The book is ok for code snippets. But, if you try to develop and run the project for each chapter you will become frustrated. The complete code is not in the text and even the download code is also incomplete. I agree with the other reviewers who said the author went from topic to topic without explaining anything."
2,Disappointed,"I have three devices that require this battery, a hedge clipper, chain saw and a reciprocating saw. The battery works with all three. However, my problem with battery is it only hold a charge for a short period of time. Charge it tonight with plans to use it the next day and the battery will not last for very long or if it is late in the day it will require recharging. I find this very annoying at best."
5,Renewed Life for our WeedEater,"These batteries seem to be working fine; we had worn out our original two batteries for our weed eater, and hoped to be able to keep using it as it was in good shape. These batteries were just right and now I can't use dead batteries as an excuse not to trim the edges of the lawn any more."
5,HomeLite Battery,"Lightning fast shipping! I ordered on Saturday and had it by Tuesday of the next week. The battery is brand new (as described) and if funds had permitted, I would've ordered another one.Thanks!"
5,Excellent!,Warren Ellis is the man! Transmetropolitan is the best. Collect the entire series. They are all great!
4,Quick fix grass seed,"This grass seed by Scott is fast growing and can be used to fill in bare spots or broadcast existing lawns. Loosen the soil in bare spots, cover seed with some soil, keep area watered (watch for hungry birds) and you will have success."
3,Hillbilly schtick from the 'Fifties,"""Simon Crum"" was the nom-de-shellac that country crooner Ferlin Husky used to record various rockabilly parodies, hard country thumpers and comedy numbers that wouldn't have fit in on his regular, softcore Capitol releases. Since this stuff has been pretty hard to find for many years, I looked forward to this release, a comprehensive set that includes all his Capitol Crum sides from the 1950s... but I was sorely disappointed. The material is very strained, and Husky's hillbilly affectations are repetitive and genuinely irritating. It's not that it's ""gimmicky"" (duh, of course it is...) but just that it's not very imaginitive or interesting. Homer & Jethro this is not. A few good tunes, but those are mostly the ones where he plays it relatively straight. I did get a kick out of the Webb Pierce parody, ""Cuzz Yore So Sweet,"" though."
4,Finally!,"Capitol promised to reissue Ferlin Husky's Simon Crum comedy recordings in the liner notes to Husky's 'Capitol Collectors Series' disc but never followed thru. I had all but given up on it until this appeared. The Crum recordings are uneven but really fun, with some rockabilly, song parodies and celebrity impressions. Now that there is practically nothing else by Ferlin Husky in print the Simon Crum disc is all the more valuable."
2,NYC Parent = Mother for these authors,"As is typical of most books for ""parents"" they seem to think that that the only type of parent is a mother. So if you're looking for a book for NYC Mothers - feel free to get this yellow pages for shopping.Oh wait there was one comment for fathers. In the ""Top ten Things to Do with Your Family on the Weekend""- number 9- ""Form a 'daddy' playgroup-dads get to bond with other dads and babies, and you get some time off."" Hmm, not only was there no information about 'daddy playgroups' but how is this a good thing to ""do with your family"" (and again, the authors clearly assume the only one who would read this book is a woman)?"
2,A few problems,Sometimes you have to click the button several times to get a song to advance. The unit that plugs in the iPod will not work when I have my cover on the iPod. I have to take it out of it's protective case so the remote unit will plug in.
5,Very Useful,I bought this book last week and couldn't put it down. The author is an excellent writer and has done a great job of getting her message across to the reader. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for sound advice in both their personal and professional life.
5,"I Love the ""Bite-Size"" Lessons","I read 52 Ways to Live Success...From the Inside Out! in just two days and keep coming back to it each week for reminders and inspiration. Some of my favorite ""bite-size"" lessons are the chapters on How to be Irresistibly Attractive; The Mindset of Positive Expectancy; Ten Seconds of Boldness, Twice a Day; and Ten Empowering Messages to Tell Yourself Daily. Jeanne Sharbuno's book is the best of dozens of motivational books with a ""trust your inner guidance"" approach that makes the process fun and increases your chances for success."
2,Bamboozled!,"I have been running for over 33 years and have had dozens of running shoes. For the price, even the sale price, the Mizuno Men's Wave Creation 5 is not a good shoe. There is a lack of cushioning that I expect from a good quality shoe and I am sure that if I was running as much as I used to I would not be able to use this shoe."
3,An inadequate version of a fine book,"This translation should not have been republished. Firstly, it is both clumsy and full of errors. Secondly, it is based on an incomplete manuscript. Grossman's final, considerably expanded text was published in the Soviet Union in the late eighties. A translation of that text is long overdue!"
2,Not at all what I expected,"This book does not teach how to make the letters. There are about 5 pages of basic stroke practice, then mostly blank pages with a few words to copy here and there. I guess it would be okay for a child needing extra practice, but is not a stand-alone in any way."
2,Not as expected...,"When purchasing this product I really thought that you would be able to trace everything in the book with some emphasis on doing it without the dotted line. That is not the case. There is one opportunity to trace the letters, sentences, etc. and them you are on your own. I really wanted something else but you can't have ""a look inside"" everything. It's ok."
2,Love Bun B and UGK and the whole deal but.......,"For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling ""gansta grizzel"" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up."
5,"Great for kids at the ""I want a horse"" stage!","My daughter watched this repeatedly (wore it out!) when she was about 4 and really wanted a horse. It contains good, practical information for the prospective horse owner."
5,Another Stax Classic,The Staple Singers get Right here.The Stax Musicianship is in High Gear here.this is When Soul Music was Soul Music.Great Arrangements&So Much Feeling that you can't turn it off.the Music is So Deep&Rich that it will Bring Tears Of Joy To Your Heart&Soul.Genius in front of The Mic&Behind it.
2,Rather worse than it should be...,"The Doctor has had it with Peri - her truculence and unwillingness to join in his unfocussed joi de vivre means that he decides to drop her off back on Earth. But on the way they run into a Kontron Tunnel, and so they investigate. One end is Earth, 1179 AD and the other on the planet Karfel, a planet with which the Doctor is familiar. But the situation on Karfel is rather more complicated than they might have expected...'Timelash' is, put simply, a bit of a mess. The Doctor and Peri don't actually become fully involved in the story until about half-way through, and the villain of the piece is pretty clichéd, including deciding to make Peri his mate. The political situation on Karfel could have been quite interesting, but sadly its carboard cut-out intrigue.The advantage of the novel over the TV serial is that you are spared both the dreadful sets and the even more dreadful overacting of Paul Darrow in the role of Tekker.Not one to seek out actively."
2,Cute but flimsy,"Cute costume for little girls but the quality is very low. An ""ear"" fell off the headband after 1minute of wear- and wouldn't go back on with fabric glue. Try figuring that out racing out the door to a party! Not good!"
5,Gets better every time.,"This is the first Rosebuds cd I purchased and four years later I still absolutely love it. Every time I listen to it, I find something I new to marvel at. 4-Track Love Song itself is worth the entire price of the cd."
5,Fantastic...I beg of you to get it,"How often does an album come out by a band --that most likely you haven't heard of -- that doesn't have ONE bad song on it? Well, this is one right here. Hold Hands and Fight, Let Us Go, and Shake Our Tree are the best songs on the album, and the last one is as irresistable as a second potato chip: it should be an anthem. I hope this band does well...they deserve it. Excellent musicianship, lyrics, and the singer has a wonderful voice, too. It's been a while (The Shins maybe?) since I've heard songs so downright infectious!"
3,A bit disappointing ! ! !,"This books starts well, dealing with all the qualitative tools, and explains quite well the differetn strategies of coding... except that, this book do not expand one's knowledge in qualitative research... it only introduces the mainframe of the qualitative research."
2,not what i thought it was,when i purchased this item i was under the impression that it was the dvd not the digital cd. when it arrived i realized what it was and looked further to find the dvd. i believe that you people need to clearly describe the item on your website to prevent this from happening again. however i did find the dvd and purchased it from amazon.com as well and was very pleased with the services this go around and will return someday to make another purchase. thnak you. jeremy wiggins
5,He is as good as ever...,I think Bill is one of the funniest guys out there. He can use what we experience in a day and bring out the humor in it. I think this is the same if not better caliber than some of his early albums.
1,NOT His Best,"I was really looking forward to this new cd, but was very disappointed. Some jokes were obviously old, and the new material was not funny at all. Save yourself the money, and don't even borrow from a friend."
3,Still Bill but not as good,"I've always loved Bill Engvall's comedy, and I couldn't wait to buy this CD. I was anticipating side-splitting comedy like his ""Here's Your Sign"" and other CDs. Unfortunately, some of the humor here was a bit lackluster.While certain segments (Ionic Breeze and Hurting Gas) were funny, there were many other places that didn't make me laugh which is unusual for a Bill Engvall CD.I don't regret buying the CD, but it's not one I'll be listening to again and again."
2,Specialised,"If you're someone who wants to show a Portie in the US, this is the book for you, and you'll probably find it an invaluable resource.If, however, you're like me and are not in the US, and do not have any desire to show, the book is of limited use. Not a complete waste of time, as there are precious few books out there on the breed, but the book seems very targeted, which is a shame."
5,A Classic!,"Kitty's book is THE reference book on the PWD. It has an in-depth history of the breed, a discussion of the temperament of the average PWD, pedigree information, etc. Although it has some tips on training, that is NOT the purpose of this book. There are plenty of training books out there!I disagree with the people who say this is just for people who show. I got my copy long before I ever showed a PWD. It is, however, a more in-depth study of the breed. For those who just want tips on how to raise a puppy, I recommend Verne Foster's book. For those who want to understand the breed and the background of their dog, get Kitty's book. I recommend getting both!There is an earlier version of this book which Kitty wrote with Deyanne Miller (who made the first successful introduction of the PWD to the United States & worked hard to rescue the breed). You do not need that edition unless you want to see photos of some of the early PWDs that are omitted in the revised edition."
3,informative but a bit dry,"This book is informative but a bit dry, goes into technicalities and history and lineage. If you are not into showing your Portuguese Water Dog, perhaps you would not be interested in this book"
4,Very helpful,Since I never traveled by train before I was looking for someone who could describe the ups and downs of train travel as well as the expense. This book does that perfectly as this man spent years doing just that on Amtrak. I am hoping some day to make a trip and want to know what to expect.
5,Stephanie's Gospel Debut!,"This shows Stephanie's religious side as sings heartily gospel songs. The essential ""I Had A Talk With God"" explains her troubles and she talks to God about them.All of the tracks are excellent, although the echoehy,smokey ""Everybody Oughta Know"" and the sweet,piano-based ""He Cares"" stand out as the album's greatest composition."
5,The best of Wes is the best of the best,What more needs to be said? This is the complete Wes Montgomery Riverside box. A jazz guitar must-have
2,Buy the Set,"I should have gotten the complete set rather than the Hornbook. As it is so heavily edited, this book has very limited usefulness."
2,BasicBook,The book is O.K. but it's a little out dated. Laws have greatly changed since this latest edition. It waists pages by explaining useless and ancient history of law and torts. Provides a broad outine of torts with sometimes poor english and sentence structure.It's a necessary read but some tort case outcomes leave you out in no-where unless you look the case up and read it for yourself.Nothing exciting.
2,Not Practical,"This magazine doesn't seem to have a specific goal in mind. They don't seem to know who their audience is - or perhaps they are trying too hard to be all things to all people?? It's not good to have a magazine which tries to appeal to yuppies, retirees, middle aged adventurists, families, 20-year-olds, etc. I just can't read the magazine because I may find only one thing mildly interesting then get bored and not even read the next issue. Without focus and a specific audience it is not readable or interesting."
5,Christmas gift,The National Geographic Traveler was a Christmas gift and was a gift my daughter wanted. It is being shipped timely.
4,Good book for readers who like traveling.,"Price is good. And it did send in time. The content of the book is interesting.Anyway, i like this book."
5,excellent magazine,"What can I say about any Nat Geo product, all first class, great reading, interesting articles about unusual places to go"
4,Good resource for the Tourist,"We enjoy this publication as it provides a good overview with photos. Its good resource for those individuals who want predictability and assurance and travel with one or more large pieces of luggage and need a bit of hand holding. In other words, a Toutist. For Travlers it can provide some pictorial examples for potential trips. In all, it has something for everybody."
2,A magazine for those with lots of money,"I dropped my subscription to National Geographic Traveler after two years. The only really good thing about the magazine was the photography of the places covered--what you would expect from a National Geographic magazine. The articles and reviews in the magazines were generally useless for me as a middle-class traveler. I travel quite a bit overseas, but cannot afford most of the places NG Traveler covers. If you can afford the $300-$500 rooms at the places NG Traveler recommends, then subscribe. But if you are the average traveler on a budget, skip this magazine."
1,too many ads not enough content,"I had this subscription for a year and at first was so excited about it. However this magazine disappoints. I thought the articles were really lacking content and depth, and everything else was just pretty superficial overview of a hotel or a place. The dramatic oh of disappoint hit me about a 1/3 of the way last year when I received the month with Maui revealed or something like that. I saved it as I was going to Maui and about a month or two later I opened it excitedly and got this what felt like a two page article full of....nothing helpful. I get cooking light and every month they do an article each issue about a place and restaurants of course. Even their articles give you a better idea of checking out a place than this magazine. Between these unhelpful articles this magazine is 90% ads. You have to make an attempt to find where the magazine is between all the ads.Big disappointment. Did not renew subscription."
2,Not up to par with other NG magazines,"NG Traveler isn't what I expected it to be. It has few lengthy, in-depth articles and many, many short paragraph snippets that give you no sense of the place it describes. Or they are the intimate thoughts of a traveler to a singular small place...and have no bearing on any trip you would take. It doesn't inspire one to travel or give many insights into traveling. In fact, I'm having trouble writing this review because I can't remember any specifics of the six issues since I started getting the magazine. I won't be renewing my subscription."
3,Declining ad revenue shows in the decline in quality and frequency,"The National Geographic Traveler is published eight times a year, down from 10 issues a year. Recently National Geographic Adventure folded, I would not be surprised if this magazine follows adventure. This magazine is a buyer beware because it might fold. After subscribing to National Geographic, I was disappointed with the quality of National Geographic Traveler.The locations, and vacations reviews in this magazine are expensive and out of budget to all but the wealthiest.Cons- Only 8 issues annually- Expensive travel recommendations"
4,Interesting magazine,Interesting magazine for people who enjoy discovering new places around the world. they also have great advises for taking airplanes or direct yourselves in foreigners cities. and the pictures are beautiful too !
3,Nice photos,I mostly look at the photos in the magazine and not the content. I like the photos and the destinations it covers.
2,Oh man....,"Doom was a difficult enough game with the keyboard, but on your PDA this game is just plain hard. It's just too hard to play with a PDA D-Pad and have any success at all. This was totally not the game for me and I shouldn't have bought it. Honestly, FPS is not the thing you want on your PDA. The better choice would be something like Simcity 2000 or that Everquest Game. Something that is primarily played with the stylus because hammering your D-Pad with a game like this will ruin it forever. No sense in damaging your PDA."
2,Doom Is What You Are In For,"Like the previous review, I was very disappointed that you could not install the product to a storage card. I had to clean everything off the Pocket PC main memory and I got the program running, but my main memory is gone once loaded. I am still attempting to get it to work on a storage card, but with little success so far."
5,WOW!!!!!!!,WOW!!!!!!! I am so excited Doom came out. I remember when I was a little kid sitting on my dad's lap shooting while my dad steered. This is simply the best classic...non stop fun and u can play it for hours...no flaws no nuthin....just pure fun!!!!!!
5,wonderful! give us more!,"I agree wholeheartedly with ""MusicFan's"" Dec. 2000 review. This is folk revival music at its best. I grew up owning lots of those Riverside folk LPs and all the material from those LPs should be reissued on CDs. .... Wonderful, beautiful, memorable songs!!!!!"
1,Deceiving...,"I feel absolutely deceived by the summary at the back of this book. I guess I should have read some of the customers' reviews at this site before diving into The Gathering. All through the book I have been looking forward to the mystery part of the story, as said that one of six friends dies and someone is responsible...All I want to say is that it turns out to be a big disappointment......A dry story too......"
1,Guilty of misrepresentation...,"...as this was neither a ""Father Koesler mystery"" nor did someone die, ""...a sudden, violent death"". Sadly, this franchise has overstayed its welcome..."
2,a disappointment,"I can understand what William Kienzle is trying to do. He wantsto help Roman Catholics and others to understand that theirchurch has changed, become more human and humane. But there areminor details like the feast of St. Joseph on March 29 instead of19 that grate on this reader. Also, after having told eachindividual's story, why repeat them in the last chapters? Totake up space? The characters are under-developed to say theleast. Having had IHM sisters for my educators he really doesnot do a good job of interpreting them. This is not ""The RosaryMurders"", to say the least."
3,"For me, nostalgia","While I have to agree that the teenagers in this book speak like no teenagers ever did - they all sound at least ten years older than they're supposed to be - for me reading a novel set largely in Holy Redeemer parish in Detroit is a bunch of happy. I grew up in Holy Redeemer, though a good twenty-five years later than this story begins, and it's lovely to see the place I knew so accurately recorded here.I bought this book for my Kindle because I was first reading Judged By Love, Bill Kienzle's biography, and I thought I'd give one of his novels a try. I'm glad I did, even though the consensus seems to be that this is probably his weakest mystery. Since I love mysteries, I'll try another too. =)"
1,Not a Mystery,"I brought this book based on the summary on the book cover. What a mistake.It is just a human interest story about several friends that aspire to become priests and nuns. As I got close to the end of the book, I kept asking ""where is the mystery part of the novel"". As I got to the last few chapters, I realized it was either going to be the quickest solved mystery or that it was not a mystery at all.It turned out to not be a mystery at all, unless the ""mystery"" is why this book is even categorized as a mystery book."
3,The Gathering,"Not quite what I thought it would be about. Did finish reading it, but willnot buy any more from this Author."
5,wonderful!,"I loved it! the first time I ever read a short detective fiction in English. I liked the ""the woman's"" cleverness. Sherlock Holmes is stopped by a woman, something he had not thought of it. I loved the Irene Adler's letter to Sherlock in the end."
3,An okay game,"I bought this game b/c I read about it in a gaming magazine. I like it, but it is really hard. You know how TR3 just isn't as fun as the original? Well, this game is kind of disappointing like that. You spend a lot of time just walking around the cities and trying to figure out what to do. I had to buy a guide to get me through it b/c I was stuck. Turns out I missed a lot of stuff in the beginning and had to start all over. I don't really recommend this game. It isn't that great."
1,Hmmmmm,"Only 1 star because I can't submit this without it! I have a machine that is well over the minimum specs for this game, but I have had trouble running it sucessfully. What angers me is that the the Eidos tech-support people won't return my e-mails. Shabby, shabby, shabby! If YOU read this I want my money back!"
4,I am Totally Confused,"This is an excellent game, graphics wise but I find the puzzles extremely difficult. I have spent countless hours drifting from building to building trying to find out what to do next. I feel that the game could be a lot more helpful in keeping in tact with the storyline and solving puzzles. Right now I've discovered Qualisar and I guess that I am supposed to be trying to get into the Archives to read the Classified info. on the case the charaacter was involved in before his disappearance but I have no clue what to do next. If anybody has any suggestions please email me."
3,"Sweet graphics and music, but...","the fighting interface isn't too bad, though it took a bit to get the controls to functions. The first person shooter is clunky, and very difficult to control. The people, while good detail to face and body, and general body movement, the minimalistic facial expressions is just creepy. While the plot is highly imaginative and original, the pace feels rather plodding. The eye and ear candy of the 3-D graphics, combined with Bowie and Reeves background music are amazing, and save the game. If you're looking for something different, or like the slow dreamscapes of mystery games, like Myst and Riven, give an Omikron a try. If you're looking for something faster-paced, look elsewhere."
1,A waste of your time and money...Seriously.,"I recently bought this book with Maltese: A complete owner's manual by Barron's--and the ""Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet"" was a waste of money comparatively.The ""GUIDE"" reads like a 5th grader's instruction manual. The author touches upon many useless topics to the new dog owner and seemingly knows little about the dog's ancestry.Furthermore, the author advocates for positive-reinforcement training only while advising extreme caution against any type of negative reinforcement. This failure to recognize an important training technique for say, barking problems, illustrates this particular author's failure to address the basic dog owner's needs.I found this book to be condescending at best and in most instances a poor reference. If you want to read a solid book about the Maltese breed, bypass this book and read Maltese: a complete owner's manual. I hope I've saved someone the time I wasted on this poor excuse for a dog book."
1,Poor sheetrock,"I purchased this book after reading the review in our local weekly newspaper. It was much hyped but the story was not a spellbinder. I read only half and disposed of the book. Not the fault of Amazon as they only advertise the sale, not publish the book."
3,GOOD BOOK - A LITTLE TEDIOUS,"I read 'Praying for Sheetrock' as a text for one of my college classes. The book was intrieging from the very beginning, but was slightly boring at first. It takes a while for the reader to be able to get into the book - the first few chapters were tedious reading. As for the content - this was the first time I'd read a book on the Civil Rights Movement, and it was quite an enlightening experience. Not having travelled on US 17, but having taken I 95 instead while driving through Georgia, but still being able to smell the paper mills, there was new meaning to me when I went through Georgia after reading this book. Ms.Greene goes into minute detail in certain parts of the book, but seems to skim over other events - some which might have been interesting to read. She is a good writer, and I look forward to reading more of her work."
4,Reading about relatives,I've been doing genealogy research and my mother's maiden name is Popwell (Poppell). Imagine my shock when I realized that I'm related to Sheriff Poppell!!
4,Contemporary race relations in small-town Georgia,"This book, about small-town Georgia during and after the civil rights movement, describes a culture and a time with which I'm not familiar. It's well-written, and although it didn't end exactly the way I was hoping, it's honest, and I probably can't argue with the ending in a nonfiction book. This is a must-read for anyone interested in race relations in the US."
2,The villains seemed way too nice.,"Relatively well written book, but I had to put it down about half-way through. For one thing, the villains seemed way too nice (the author definitely portrayed them that way) and the heroes were somewhat too evil (criminal activity seemed rampant). I did enjoy the fact that the gun ownership of the poor people in McIntosh County was essential to their gaining increased rights. It was clear while reading that an unarmed poor populace has no political rights and no way to gain them."
5,cat 5 cable,For the price these are actually very good cables they have rubber covers over the ends and work like a charm. The best part was the price these where cheaper than trying to make it yourself
3,Watch that grease fitting!,"Watch out! If you're installing this on a 4X4, don't do what I did - I installed it with the grease fitting in place and realized it way too late - it interferes with the axle U-joint hub and I had a 50-50 chance it would be in the right place to allow me to remove it. I was in the wrong 50%. Bummer so at least I greased it but I had to shear it off and seal the hole with RTV. So happens that item 14 int he little instruction sheet that came with it warns you about this problem but that clue is nowhere else to be found and I wish I had caught it sooner so I'll be doing this job again in a year or 2 since I cannot grease this joint again."
3,Looks good once installed.,Screws that hold sub-frame to the actual switch did not thread at all had to use flat head white screw that were in old screw on plate.
4,Not bad -before- going to Starbucks,"It's a fine artistic movie that has a real down-to-earth feel.I have a habit loading up on caffeine before watching a show to ""up"" my attentiveness in hopes to get more out of a flick, but doing so before this particular piece left me feeling antsy. It has a pace that's good to watch after sitting on the pier all day watching the ships roll out and then watching them roll back in again.Skip the Starbucks, eat your popcorn with a caffiene-free soda, and be sure not to be in a rush to go anywhere after the show and I'm sure you'll find this DVD rather enjoyable."
5,"Unique & Fun, Start-To-Finnish","I've watched this three times now, and throughly enjoyed all three viewings, finding this film to really be a unique one. It's a Finnish film, which is unusual to start with, at least here in the U.S. because we don't see too many films from Finland. It's a black comedy, meaning deadpan looks with subtle comedic lines.The main actor, Markuu Peltola, is perfect for this movie with one of the most deadpan faces you'll ever see. He is amazing to watch and Kati Outinen, as his love interest, is similarly strange and fascinating. Part of their charm are their unusual looks. This is not a romance between people who look like your normal handsome film stars.Simply, this is just something very different from anything you've seen. It's a combination of drama, comedy and romance with some of the strangest dialog I've ever heard on film.If you appreciate dry humor and a bizarre but touching story, you should see this."
2,Dishonest seller -- NOT Extech RF20 refractor,"I searched and searched looking for upscale instrument and thought this would fit the bill. I thought I was buying an very good quality refractometer judging by the reviews. I did not even bother to try it as it is no better than one for half the price. The package insert says nothing about were it is made, what firm made it, address, email, contact, anything. Save your money. You get the impression you are getting a higher quality instrument, but this is just a chintzy product with a case, like you would get buying a tool at Harbor Freight. Arrive poorly packaged for mailing too. Way over priced. Returning.UPDATE: As I suspected: This is a Chinese knock-off. Below is the link to what you will get. It is NOT an Extech instrument. I have not heard from the seller. This hacks me off. Will ask Amazon for immediate refund.[...]"
5,Best of the series,"After listening to all volumes of the Symphonies of the Planets, Vol. 3 is my clear favorite. This track is so relaxing that I use it while working to keep my stress low."
3,"It would seem so, Socrates","I find it richly ironic that there is no Cambridge companion to the Cambridge Platonists.How come? You never become prophet in your hometown, I suppose..."
5,Is Justice always good?,"In Plato's <republic>, he justify the idea of goodness. His dialetic speech is so tight and logic that everybody in this dialogue agree his opinion(doxa). Plato has willing to persue the episteme(truth knowledge, not doxa), and this will be connects the idea of goodness. This book has 15 essays on Plato's philosophy. and every article has their themes; for example <physics in plato's philosophy>. Readers can get the better orthodox toward Plato's philosophy with this book."
3,Not all bad,"My 2 yr old likes this video, mainly because she loves Elmo but also because she is infatuated with Santa and Christmas. The story does get a bit depressing, but that's sort of the point. The scenes with Big Bird make me want to turn it off, but it's pretty cute how the naive little Elmo thinks Christmas everyday is a great idea, then comes to the realization that it probably isn't. The storyline is really more suited toward an older child of perhaps 4 or 5. Also, while I truly enjoyed Charles Durning's Santa, I think a more ""jolly"" old St. Nick would've been more appropriate for the kids."
1,WORST Christmas Video,My 2 year old daughter hated this video & I don't blame her. It was depressing - there were too many repetitions of them singing this depressing song before they finally get to the end and are happy again. Just a horrible Christmas video - Don't buy it!
5,Such a cute Christmas dvd,"My daughter enjoys this dvd and keeps going back to it over and over, even though it's not the Christmas season. I think she is preparing herself for the holiday since she loves Christmas so much."
5,Great Story,I had this as a video tape but decided to get the DVD because I wanted it to last longer than the tape did!
4,Toddler Approved!,Cute movie... dated but my 15 mo old still enjoyed it. Great songs and cute story too! I recommend for sure.
5,Elmo saves Christmas,"Was a purchase for my 2 year old great neice, and she loved it. Made her Christmas morning. Elmo is her favorite"
4,**FREE** ~ Don't waste your money!,"Microsoft distributes SharePoint Designer for free. As mentioned by others, save your money for some books so you can figure out how to use it! This software is not user friendly.SPD has a steep learning curve, but once mastered, is a powerful tool for manipulating SharePoint. If you've never used custom workflows, read more about it - they can automate a lot of data movement between lists (among other things)."
4,SharePoint Made easy,This has made working with certain parts of Sharepoint development very straight forward. This is a great product if your into web development.
4,How a horn should be: loud!,"I bought these horns years ago & finally got around to installing them in my Civic Hybrid (with a wimpy toy car like horn). They sounded like much louder version of the factory horn. If the factory horn (there was just one) was a small anemic honey bee, these were like two big Japanese hornets.I would have liked to install trumpet horns but didn't know if they would fit, these fit nicely in the same spot where the original horn sat. The relay for some reason did not work but I just wired them directly and they worked that way.Now I am not embarrassed to use the horns when I needed to. Which is cool.. :-)"
4,STYLISH LITTLE HORNSET!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great little horn set for your rod, car or motorcycle!! Nice red composite housing, gold irridate plated hardware!! -STYLISH!More of a motorcycle-style horn than seen on modern passenger cars.Best mounting location for these OR ANY horn is the front grill area-where they have the most sound-projected volume---WARNING! If you live in a salty state (like ohio), mounting anything in the grill area of the car will disintegrate (due to) SALT!!Get em' factory fresh from--AMAZON!!!!"
4,Appealing to the motivated student,Dudley Moore and Sir Georg Solti's enthusiasm have infected my students and motivated them to learn more about orchestral music.Not only for students but for all who want to learn the fundamentals about the instruments of the orchestra and the way in which orchestral music is brought together in a performance.
5,Wow - A top 5 CD of 2005,"From the opening anthemic Ashes until the climactic epic Out of Nothing, this is a fantastic ride by an underrated and underappreciated band.Personal favorites include Glorious Day, Spell it Out and especially Someday.I have been into this band since 1998 and unfortunately it does not appear that they will ever break in the states. Unfortunate that we have to listen to monontonic drones like John Mayer here.They have had good albums before but the songs were more up and then down. They brought in crackpot producer Youth (the same man brought us The Verve-Urban Hymns and the excellent Howie Day debut release) and really amped up. The result is a very full and layered sound complete with string arrangements in many songs.Had a chance to meet them and have drinks with the band while in Denver and you will never meet a more humble group of guys.If you like Coldplay, The Verve, and early Oasis buy with no worries - it will not disappoint."
3,Fantastic Album,"Recently I saw Embrace (until then I had never heard of them) open for Snow Patrol. They ALMOST stole the show. They were FANTASTIC live....all about the music. They extended the jams, and the harmonies were tight yest still very raw.This disc will really please any listener. While may Brit Pop bands of today have that whole striped down, shoegazer thing going, Embrace looked at production as a chance to really bring in a full and lush sound.Every song stands well on its own. Out of Nothign is beautiful, and makes you wonder why these boys aren't where Coldplay or Oasis are.They know their strentghs and weaknesses and push the envekope just far enough to stay right on track. This is their 4th disc, but I think it is the 1st, in their international climb to fame."
5,"Great, Straightforward Book","This is a really excellent book of knots for climbers. No nonsense, very clear, easy to figure out illustrations (really Mike Clelland is possibly the best, to say nothing of his great cartoons). The exceptional thing about this book of knots is the explanations that go with the knots. Lucid and well-written. The why, wherefore and, even in some cases why NOT...of a knot. It's not just a collection of a large number of knots you could use and have at it sort of thing. Since there are not that many that a climber truly needs (or wants), this book's it. Esoteric knots and decoratives are great, but beyond the scope for climbers.This one's really all you need."
2,Greatly over-rated,"This book is not only outdated but it contains a lot of bad advice about knots. It shows numerous knots that have no place in the climbing world, leaves out others that are more useful, and has weak material about ropes. There are certainly better books on knots for climbers."
5,Outstanding,"Bear Family continues to outdo itself with these immense boxsets. I have been a fan of Stonewall Jackson since I can remember, and the numbers included here I have not heard since I had a turntable and 33's. The sound presented here is superb...but what else would you expect. Sure, these box sets are pricy, but when you consider the incredible sound, detailed large booklet detailing the discography and artists' career, and the large number of songs, it is worth your money. This box set covers the earlier years of Stonewall, when he was topping the charts regularly. The better-known songs are included here (including ""Waterloo"", ""Why I'm Walkin'"", and ""Dont Be Angry""), but there's also a whole catalog of early releases that you may not have heard, but will definately enjoy. The only criticism I have is that I cant decide which of the 4 discs I enjoy listening to the most! A great Box-set....get it. A+"
3,He sold out,"Since he went mainstream it seems that now he is only trying to appeal to the masses and I agree this has helped him lose touch of the underground electronic music scene. If you are a fan of his old stuff then you might not enjoy this CD. If you like his new style, which to me seems more poppy, then go for it, but take a look of his old stuff if you want a taste of the real Oakenfold."
1,Not worth your money,"I have been a Oakenfold fan for many years now and was quite disappointed with the Bunka album. Like many others I was drawn in by Stary Eyed Suprise, and Ready Steady Go, yet the rest of the album is total .... Oakenfold is arguably a musical genius, producing bands like U2, and discovering numerous electronic music artists with his Perfecto label. Bunka is essentially Oakenfolds sell out album, going directly for mass pop appeal by sacrificing artisic integrity, and possilby his former fan base. My advise is this: don't buy the album, download tracks 1, 2, and 8, and buy his Tranceport album (probably his best)."
2,Definatly not oakenfold,"I guess if you've heard his stuff on the radio from this cd and you like it, it'll probably be the only one that you do like that the man has put out. Compleatly different in every way possible from all his other stuff."
2,Oakenfold has lost his unique touch!,"I feel that Oakenfold's, ""Bunkka"" does not even compare to his old albums. His new ""style"" that he exhibits in this album will leave old fans of Oakey disappointed... Although this album has big names, such as: Nelly Fertado and Ice Cube, this album does not measure up to his old masterpieces. Trance fans will most likely be unimpressed with this album because it has a techno-pop routine that repeats itself throughout the whole album. I suggest buying tranceport if you want to hear the real Oakenfold!"
1,Not a good one...,I would not recommend those who like PA to purchase this CD. I think this CD doesn't reflect his style. It's very hard to listen to compared to his previous CDs. If you want to get some jungle or trip hop there are plenty of other artists in this category...
2,Debunk this load of bunkka.,"This album is bunk! The great Oakie has fallen down the slippery slope that consumed Moby et. al. I give it 2 stars because of the great opening track, then the album goes down and down into the abyss of sell-out from there.I saw his bunk tour in Detroit, it was cool until he put his decks away and some guy came out on stage with an electric guitar and tried to play live techno on it. Needless to say there was no vibe at the event.There's still hope for Oakie. Everyone is entitled to a mistake every now and then, but if he repeats this error with another sellout album, we'll have to pass the heavyweight champion title to a new DJ."
1,If your EARS could get AIDS..,"Then this would be that one time you wish you'd used a condom.For all those Oakie fans who own or have listened to albums like Tranceport, A Voyage Into Trance, Travelling, or Another World, and you LIKE them, then DO NOT put yourself within a mile's radius of this bright orange evil called ""Bunkka"". This isn't even TRANCE. It's GARBAGE and I don't kno WHAT to call it but I wish I could give it -5 stars. After listening to this CD, I just can't look at Oakenfold the same way anymore. I would have been happier getting the new JoJo or Hillary Duff album. But then again, that's probably what you'll find in the CD collection of anyone in here giving this album a positive review.Avoid this pop sell-out session of suck like it was the plague.*shudders*"
5,Research First,"Before you buy this album you must do your research. Of course you will not like this album if you are expecting trance or house. Almost every song has vocals, there is little to no trance, and absolutely no house (thank god). Some songs to download are ""Southern Sun, Starry-eyed Surprise, and Motion."" These songs should help you to determine whether to buy or not. This is the type of cd that you can play over and over and still love it. On a side note, I'm tired of reading whiny reviews complaining that this cd isn't his usual self. What are you expecting, every release to sound the same? Oakenfold is branching out to new sounds, deal with it."
1,Bunkka is nothing but Junkka !!,"I've been an Paul Oakenfold fan for years. I've had the pleasure of experiencing his magic at the clubs. His remixes are without a doubt the BEST in the trance/house music world. But this album has totally abandoned all of what has made Oakenfold a club scene icon.This album is AWEFUL. Period. My jaw dropped as I listened to each track. Instead of an exciting journey of house trance, I was dragged through a mix of pop rap that was totally laughable.Please Mr. Oakenfold, go back to your original style of music!! There is nothing on this album that even warrants a single beat on the dance floor."
1,God-awful album,"This is a really, really poor album. I consider myself an Oakenfold fan in general, and was pretty excited about his first original-composition work. I was not shocked to find the album was designed to have pop-appeal-- what shocked me was how cheaply this was done. Only one or two tracks rank at ""listenable"" status in my opinion, and this is not enough to merit buying the album. There is just no artistic talent here. The ""all-star cast"" only adds insult to injury, because it is obvious that the album is just a big commercial promotion of the kind you expect from an ""artist"" who just wants to ""cash in."" For fun pop-electronic done well, try BT's ""Movement in Still Life"" and steer clear of this stinker. I wouldn't take it for free."
1,completely sold out,Oakenfold sold out more and more year after year. This album is even worst than I could have Imagined. He has totally moved away from trance and into the pop world. This album has absolutely nothing to do with modern electronic dance music and should not be confused as such. I think this proves that Oakenfold is all about the dollar and not about the music.
3,Mediocre & Tired,"This is quite a listenable album but considering an artiste of Oakenfold stature, I would at least expect some ground-breaking stuff out of Bunkka. Not so here. To his credit, it is an extremely well-polished effort which ambles along at a credible pace but horrors, monotony set in after a while. No explosion of emotion upon this listen sorry."
4,Great CD!,"I bought this CD as a gift for my husband (who is a techno/trance/house fan), and although I was completely unfamiliar with the artist, I've enjoyed the CD as much as he has!"
2,Mediocre at best !,"Not as good as expected.1) If you're a pop/mainstream music lover, you may like this one (doubt it).2) If you're an Oakenfold fan, a techno/trance/electronic music lover, then this one will definitely dissapoint you. NOT FOR YOU !This is an attempt (a mediocre one) of a fantastic DJ to go manistream, and it really fails to do so.Here is my final word. If you like radio music and enjoy some techno, get something else, there is not enough melody here for you. If you are a techno/trance music fan, I am sorry to say that this is not for you either. You're better off getting Oakenfold's TRANCEPORT... There are only two or three decent (OK) tracks here. The rest is garbage... Two and a half stars is as best as I can do for this one, and I am being generous."
1,My God ! What have they done!!!,"From Heaven to Hell, from good music to commercial pop... What happened to Paul Oakenfold? Too much ""enigma"" in his coffee? Bunkka was a good album and enhancing it would have been very difficult. Instead of that the result of Bunkka (enhanced) will dissapoint all the fans... of course on a busyness point of view it is more accessible to the average listener...money talks...again!PAUL OAKENFOLD's WORST ALBUM EVER...."
2,Overrated,"With all my friends hyping Paul Oakenfold, I thought it might be something special. Not at all. Ready, Steady, Go is the only moderately catchy track on the album - the rest are dippy mood music. If you want interesting electronica, try BT (not perfect, but WAY better than this), or better yet, Bush - Deconstructed."
1,SuperOakie on Kryptonite?,"Someone has taken over the controls of Oakenfold Central, and our Trance/Dance Superman, was slayed with a big slab of Kryptonite. Everyone's review talks about how this is a breakthrough album, or how the old skool vs new skool rap is meshed well. If you want old skool rap, why would you want to go pickup an OAKIE CD? Get real, this is an experimental CD that's bandaided together and just doesn't work. What bugs me the most? It's that Oakie headquarters have now truly been taken over by Lex Luthor! Someone, PLEASE get Lois Lane to rescue SuperOakie, or we're doomed for more of this junk!"
3,Oakenfold - Bunkka,"In 2002, Bunkka became his first official studio album when he signed to Maverick. Bunkka is a compilation of styles which Paul has learned to mix throughout his career; the blending in of progressive trance with goa makes the album different from other conventional dance album. The name Bunkka comes from Peter Gabriel's studio in the UK, where the album was recorded. An extended play was released featuring live versions of four songs under Peoplesound Records. It is also Oakenfold's best selling album to date, with sales largely exceeding 1 million copies worldwide."
5,Bunkkatabulous,"I managed to pick up Paul Oakenfold's Bunkka today and must say, already it's a classic amongst my collection. This is an absolutely brilliant CD, mixing rock, hip-hop, pop, and of course, electronic music onto one album. Every song manages to be completely different from the previous, you get a new sound with every song. The highlights I would have to say are Ready Steady Go, Southern Sun, Zoo York, Starry Eyed Surprise, Get Em Up, and The Harder They Come.There is only one thing that bothers me a little, and that is that the song Zoo York uses the theme from the movie Requiem For A Dream, but nowhere in the track credits is there a mention of this sample taken or any kind of recognition for Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet. But, hey, he had to have gotten permission....right?Anyway, amazing album from the Oak-Man!!! Pick it up!"
4,Oblique and Very good!,"Paul Oakenfold is a dynamite. Vey crafty with beats and - more importantly vocals. BUNKKA is a move to more dynamic move to commercial music. But don't blame him for it: More commercials make him hip. Paul's hip translation (and transformation) to star-status is obvious. Madonna's MAVERICK Records has pushed Oakenfold to absorb is talents and explore his beat wisdom. Quirky, yes, but brilliant, yes!Ready Steady go!, Time of your Life, Zoo York (My favorite) Hold your Hand, Starry Eyed Surprise, and Get Em Up are sure fire winners. You owe it yourself to get with this!"
3,Different,"This is the only Oakenfold albumn I've purchased and it was a gift for someone. I've heard some of this others and listened extensively to his Essential Mix tour. The reason I purchased this album was because I read it was different from his usual trance stuff. Different it was. I'm willing to give Oakie 3 stars because he tried something different.I didn't really enjoy the CD. Maybe it was because I was driving through NYC on a Saturday night ready to go to a club, but the CD didn't invoke any emotion out of me. I find the track ordering very poor.I really tried to like the CD but I couldn't. The best thing that could be said for this CD is that it isn't the usual trance garbage."
1,Lame!,"I was totally surprised at this CD! Oakenfold has been the driving ambition for alot of aspiring techno artist and DJ's.The music has no form to it, and with all these different collaborations of this music makes it even worse. Its like he made this overnight! He's better off with just stickin with producing music, not making it."
5,Oakie Shines!!!,"Bunkka, aside from being a brilliant album with a variety of sound influences, is the best thing i've heard in a long while. Admittedly, i'm a dedicated trance/house follower, but nobody can deny that the ice cube track isn't hot. If this sort of musical progression (a beautiful fusion of sorts) is the new path of music, at least for Oakie, then i'll never be disappointed. Thank you oakie, thank you. 'Till the next album drops ... !!!"
4,Cool !,"I bought this CD for the song ""Ready ,Steady ,Go ! This was of course hearing on the radio , The first song is GREAT !! , But the rest keep different beats ? , It is almost like each song is personal , So I am giving this CD only four stars .If you are looking for fast paced dance ! get something else !"
2,Held together with glue,"Patchy, derivative, unoriginal. How exactly is this an album of original music -- it's sample mania, from sounds to vocals to grooves. He lifts entire pieces from Kronos Quartet, ferchrissake. If cheesy Eurodiva vocals are your thing (I guess he couldn't get Bjork but didn't mind finding someone who imitates her), you'll be in heaven here. In terms of originality and composition it isn't all that much better than stuff being produced by a slew of bedroom musicians across the world using Cubase or ProTools on their PCs. You can hear stuff as good or better on mp3.com any time. On the plus side, it's well produced and he gets decent synth sounds. Oakenfold is enormously popular and not about to go away -- like most bubblegum, when it catches, it's hard to get rid of."
2,I'd buy a this CD if,"it was re-released with vocals lifted with exception of Southern Sun. I realize Oakey was diverse musical background and perhaps my musical tastes are narrow but this CD was a let down. Another World was not pure trance but I loved it (I love Dead Can Dance and the whole 4AD sound). The vocals on Bunkka just gets in the way of enjoying the music. On electronic music, I generally prefer just ethereal female voices (e.g. any Jan Johnston or McLachlan on Delerium's Silence). Nearly half the Bunkka tracks have rap/hip-hop in it. Puke."
2,destroying his image...,"This is a very experimental CD from Oakie in a way similar to Swordfish. I think its a shame because it really seems like he has left his old style behind and now seems to persue a more'pop'y style to his music including famous American artists in his tracks. The Reviews on this CD resume itself to either1 or 5stars (like him or hate him). Like others say DO NOT buy this CD if you are expecting some of Oakie's ""good"" work (Perfecto Presents, tranceport)but if you like pop, then do buy it, Oakie still has GREAT talent...this could be called electropop I guess."
2,"Great premise, weak execution","2.4 starsI love the idea here, but the direction, acting and general quality are barely b-movie. The lighting and set-ups are pure low budget and I had trouble getting past that and into the concept.Make sure to watch this in Spanish; as bad as the subtitles are, they are masterful next to some of the worst English dubbing I've ever heard.All in all, we were very bored very quickly; this movie has some scenes that are just sheer nothingness posing as suspense, and once you've figured out the main idea, it's all pretty obvious. I've seen dozens of time travel movies and this is easily one of the worst-made.No matter how good your premise is, if the filmmaking is weak the film itself is going to be subpar. Timecrimes is the perfect example of that."
4,Exceeds Expectations,"Through the first 10-20 minutes, I thought ""OK, just another run of the mill, mildly entertaining Sci-Fi/Fantasy thriller"". But if you view the entire movie, you come to appreciate that it is far from ordinary. A brilliant effort and a truly 'Different' and surprisingly thoughtful film."
3,"Good, not great Time Travel Film","NON Spoiler Alert Review...this was a good time travel movie...but the cover boasts it as ""One of the Greatest Time Travel Movies of All Time""....Heck No, it isn't on the same level as say deja vu with Denvel, the movie suffers from it's own logic...the main character doesn't stop repeating the same mistakes...but seems to just complete the time loop for the heack of it...it is a really intresting idea which fails by its own logic or lack there of."
5,What a great movie,"This is a sleeper. Never heard of it. Bought it totally on Amazon reviews. Story is simple, yet compelling."
1,"Dubbed, and badly",This is not a review of the movie because I had to stop watching after two minutes. The Instant Watch version is a terrible English dub. Do not buy or rent the Instant Watch version. I hear the movie is good though. I'm planning to rent the DVD from a competitor now.
1,A Criminal Waste of My Time,"I'm going to heroically be the rehasher of the coldest hash of jokes on this when I say that this film was itself a time crime. I guess that's what makes this some sort of cerebral or intellectual film, that paradox. If you get through this movie, there's a good chance you'll arrive on the other side of it thinking ""well that was pretty dumb."" But then you recall the feature's title, and Whammo! The brilliance of the paradox crushes your brain; you realize that the entire experience was a time crime perpetrated on you. I'm a big fan of epiphanic experience, but I probably wouldn't willingly watch this bad of a movie again even if it promised another epiphany. It was real bad."
2,"Clever premise, but falls flat...","I just got done watching this and have to say that I am left unimpressed and actually quite dissapointed. The dvd itself if ok, with some extras. But as for the film itself, I would not recommend it to anyone else. I was expecting something similar to Primer, at least in theory.The whole 'bandaged man' thing and the time travel aspect were the most frustrating and really made the movie painful to watch after halfway through. If this is what time travel is like, then don't sign me up, as its a bummer!"
1,So bad acting and directing that I couldn't finish viewing it!,"I am a time travel movies' fan and have a pretty complete collection (almost 40 movies), but this one isn't going to be in it, unless somebody remakes it. I began seeing it and couldn't stand the bad acting and directing. I seldom don't finish a movie, no matter how bad it is, but this one went beyond bad. From the reviews I have read here, it seems as if it has an interesting plot, but the acting was so bad that I couldn't stand to watch more than 20 minutes of it. That's the longest I could hold the impulse to puke! Spanish is my first language, so I didn't have a language issue. Fortunately I didn't buy it. I wish they remake it so I can enjoy the interesting plot and twists others say it has, because as much as I love the time travel theme, I don't think I can stomach trying to watch this awful version again."
5,GREAT TIME TRAVEL MOVIE,ONE OF THE BEST TIME TRAVELING MOVIE I EVER SAW. GREAT STORY AND A LOT OF SUSPENSE IN THE PLOT. I RECOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE A GOOD THRILLER ON TIME TRAVELING UNIVERSE.
5,A+++++++ Great Reading,"THIS IS REALLY THE BEST BIBLE EVER. I HAVE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE BIBLE, BUT THIS ONE I CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I AM IN MY MID 20s AND JUST NOW UNDERSTANDING GOD'S WORD, THANKS TO THE NEW RAINBOW BIBLE AND MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND WHO PURCHASED IT FOR ME. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OR EVERYTING ABOUT THE BIBLE THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU."
5,THE MOST BIG AVENTURE THAT I EVER PLAYED!,"Shadowman is definitily the most Great aventure that i ever played, maybe it not contains greats images, but i got really addicted to played it.The reason for this addiction, is that this game contains innumerals secrets around, and if you not have a guide, you maybe be 100 hours! sit in your chair.Well i haven't finish the game yet, but i enjoy a lot that this game be the longest aventure game around!"
4,Cold Chills,"I played this game when I had the nintendo 64, and owned this game. When the cut-scene where is little brother is at the aslym, that is what gave me the cold chills. This game could have been easier to play. I am looking for this game again, but I am running XP verison and can't find it."
2,"The book was all right, but it was not in ""good"" condition--too stained.","As I said above, the book was all right, but it was not in ""good"" condition, as described. It was quite stained (I guess) by light exposure."
5,Super Punch Out!,"This game is a must have for any Nintendo Gamecube owner. it also features a minigame ""Super Punch Out"" from 1994 Super Nintendo."
4,Seems alright.,"The case and the cover insert was sorta ratted up, which was not in the bio of the one we bought. But the game seems to play well. My boyfriend has actually stopped playing, because ""its to hard"". But hes irrelevant!"
2,DO NOT buy this to add to coffee!!,"If you add this to coffee and use any kind of creamer - powdered, liquid or real cream - it curdles! I was looking for a flavor add-in after I got hooked on Duncan Donuts Strawberry Shortcake coffee, which is really pricey, if you can find it. This is the wrong product for that application. If I had any intention of making snow cones, it might warrant space on my shelf, but unless it turns out to play nicely in baked goods (I'm not sure I want to risk having to throw out batter just to find out), I can't see much reason for keeping it. A more complete description of what the product is intended to do and what it should not be used for would have prevented me from wasting money on it. It's probably too much to hope that the seller will edit the description to make this product reach the right buyers."
5,The Best Yet From Nora!,"I've been a Nora Roberts fan for years and have always looked forward to her next book! Somehow, I missed this one when it first came out. Luckily, I didn't miss it entirely. I know it sounds trite, but I didn't want it to end. Believable, likeable characters...a sinister, spine tingling plot...and a terrific setting...all wrapped up in the best prose yet from Nora Roberts. I'll definitely pick this one up again for a re-read. If you haven't read it...get a copy quick...and put aside an evening or two!"
3,Predictable but still interesting,"I figured out the murderer by mid book mainly because I know Nora Roberts style of having a surprise ending that could still make sense to the story and so it was easy to figure out. Still I read it through to be sure I was right. The romance didn't make me feel anything. The characters didn't seem to connect in a way that made me feel that they were honestly in love. The lead male was two dimensional and even the lead female was a little too cold at times but still had depth. The theme of sex and violence was a nice change for me. I enjoyed that it was a little different from all her books and more of a mystery. I wanted more of a closure at the ending, but it kind of ended abruptly. Also, there were times when the story dragged as Roberts tried to flesh out small characters. I could have done with out that but still it was interesting and a good book to read if there's nothing else to do."
4,Different...but GREAT!,"This was a different story line for Roberts, but the great mix of characters make it all worth while. The flash backs and the suspense were excellent. The bond that Tory shared with Hope is undeniable. Never have I read a book that completely shocked me at the end. Great stuff!"
5,One of Roberts's three all time bests,"Carolina Moon will be added to Carnal Innocence and Hidden Riches as my three all time favorite books by Nora Roberts. This story was completely enthralling. Faith, the heroine, goes back home to confront her past and solve the long-ago murder of her childhood friend, and falls in love with Faith's brother, Cade. Nora's writing just keeps getting better. I was immersed in this story from start to finish. The only thing that marred my enjoyment was the characterization. With all that happened in the story, I didn't feel as connected to the hero and heroine as I usually do in Roberts's books. However, that fact doesn't detract from Carolina Moon's top notch mystery. This is one book you'd be ill-advised to miss!"
3,Carolina Moon,"For some reason I didn't like this new book by Nora Roberts. It seems to me that there is not a strong relationship between Cade and Tory. I don't think her characters had as much depth as they usually do in her books. Nora is still my favorite author, but I would suggest her mystery books, by J.D.Robb pseudonym, as a better alternative to Carolina Moon. Witness in Death was just released and it was excellent."
5,Nora Roberts at her bast,"WOW! This book was excellent - I was up until 3:00 AM reading it because I could not put it down. I loved the characters in this novel, especially Faith. The book kept me guessing until the end as to who the killer was (and what a shock it was). A must read!"
3,The story was okay but could have been better!,I'm a big fan of this writer's (usually) but I'm sorry to say a little dissappointed with this book. It was okay but not up to Nora's usual norm. Will I buy her next book? CERTAINLY! I'm one of her biggest fans!
3,Not fair to the reader,"I can't really share why I think she was unfair to her readers in this one without revealing too much of the plot. But let me at least say that I don't think she truly provided clues so that a close reader could have figured out the mystery. When the killer was revealed, instead of being filled with amazement and wonder at her cleverness in hiding his true identity, I was just filled with resentment. She had provided almost no clues to his identity and the ones she did provide were based more on prejudice against a minority that even politically correct Americans still find it acceptable to put down. I can't recommend this book."
1,New Nora Roberts trend - nasty sexual violence,"I have read and enjoyed a few of Nora Roberts books, specifically Inner Harbor. Unfortunately, Carolina Moon is not one of Robert's better efforts. Unfortunately she seems to be moving into a phase where she feels compelled to create plots with explicit sexual violence and murder scenes, and although all the other reviews I have read have been OK with it, haven't even mentioned it in fact, I am not. Nasty rape scenes are definitely not something I want to read fictionalized accounts of for entertainment, and sorry, I don't believe such explicitness is required for plot development. If you are not the type to be bothered by it though, this book is formulaic yet readable and will hold your attention on a airplane."
5,THIS SHOULD BE A MOVIE!,"This is the first Nora Roberts I've read. I love mysteries, and am usually enclined to read John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark, Stephen King. My Mother-in-law suggested Nora Roberts so I opted for this title. Never before have I been so engrossed in a novel that I actually envisioned it as a movie, with Sandra Bullock as Tori, Matthew McConnaghey (sp?) as Cade, and Gwennyth Paltrow as Faith. FUN! I reccommend this book to anyone who loves a good ""who-dunnit"". Wonderfully exciting reading!"
4,Enjoyable,"I've been reading Nora Roberts for about three years and always enjoy her books. Carolina Moon was no exception. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Faith and Wade. However, being a veterinarian myself, I can say the scenes in the vet clinic were completely unrealistic. At times, I found myself laughing at how off base Roberts was on the workings of a veterinary clinic. Otherwise, the book was good, although the ending was a bit strange."
1,"Same old, same old","How can you tell any of Nora Roberts' single title hardcovers apart? They all have the same stock characters and plots, she only changes the setting: The trampy girl with a heart of gold, the artistic heroine with a disturbing murder in her past, the quirky townsfolk, the bitter martiarch, etc. The story is predictable, as are the romances. Just once I'd like to see Roberts make the hero the killer---but then she wouldn't sell nearly as many books. Disappointing and uninvolving, it's simply a retread of any of her earlier books."
3,Carolina Moon,"As an avid reader of Nora Robert's books, I was more than a little disapointed over her latest novel. As a South Carolinian, I found her depiction of small-town southern style accurate but I felt that she tried to force the entire character of Tory on the reader. The first chapter was unnecessary and the whole plot felt awkward. As always, however, she managed to heat up the story with steamy scenes and emotions. Loved the setting, but it didn't have the vintage twist and pull of a Robert's novel"
1,Appalling.,"Excuse me, but wasnt anyone who has read this book as appalled as I was by the fact that the empath-heroine walks herself through the scene of a brutal rape/murder, basically experiencing everything the victim did, and then immediately goes home and has sex with her perfect love interest? Yuck! Until I reached that point, I was genuinely compelled by the book, the choppy writing and the inconsistencies notwithstanding. But that scene was utterly arrogant on Roberts' part. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and lose myself in a romantic fantasy, but it should at least ring A LITTLE BIT true. Am I as a reader supposed to immediately dismiss this perfectly nice girl (who could just as well have been the heroine of another romance) who's been brutally murdered and instead identify with a heroine so callous? Don't insult me."
1,Disappointing,I always buy Nora Roberts books--this one however was a disappointment to me. It seemed choppy and not believable.....and the ending just didn't seem to ring true. It just seemed like she rushed through writing it....I couldn't recommend this to anyone.
1,Big let down and boring,"I really enjoy Nora Roberts books and especially the once she writes under the name of J.D.Robb. Her style is very entertaining and keeps you involved in the story from the beginning till the end. Most of the time you are sorry to see the story come to a end. But this book is a big let down. From the first page on it is very hard to become involved into the story and to remain interested. It is not worth the money. I am sorry to say so. But it is true. It is a bit unrealistic,has some mistakes in it and even though that is not bad, the whole story is absolutely boring.Been there, done that, have read this multiple times before, is the type of feeling you get right away. The end unrealistic and the whole book feels so depressive and totally is not worth your time and not getting any better. I hope her next books are more like herself and her style again. I like changes but this is boring and almost makes you feel as if she didn't spend much time on it."
4,Spectacular,"Well, it has all the goodies, good romance, great suspense, strong characters, but personally I found Faith and Wade's romance much more interesting than Cade and Tory's one, however it was great to read this amazing story."
4,Another great book from Nora,I loved the book so much I couldn't put it down. Throughout the story I loved the character of Faith and the way she opens herself to accepting her faults and moving forward with new understanding for relationships. As I got to the end of the book I certainly had no idea that the killer was who it was. I was entranced by the story throughout. Well done yet again Nora Roberts!
4,Carolina Moon by Nora Roberts,"Good story with final twist, that I enjoyed reading. I like books written Nora Roberts and JD Robb. I will read more of her books."
4,A Little More Weird Than Her Usual...,"Tory Bodeen has returned to the small town in South Carolina where she grew up. Tory was the daughter of an abusive father and a mother that stood by her husband. Her best friend, Hope Lavelle, was the daughter of a well-to-do family. After Hope was murdered, Tory eventually left her family and set out on her own. Tory has also been gifted with psychic powers; ""the sight"", her grandmother called it. Now Tory is a grown woman and she's come back to her old home, moved into the house where she grew up on the Lavelle's property, and is opening her own business. Now she must learn to face the animosity of some, and the gossip of others, make her place in the town she once called home, and face the circumstances of Hope's death. She must discover who the murderer is, or she may be next."
2,Snoozer,"I got this book from the library, thankfully.The first chapter seemed familiar & I realized I had checked it out previously and couldn't get into it then, either.This time I got 1/2 way through it & was not unhappy to discover it was due back at the library and non-renewable b/c it's new.I just didn't care about these characters. Tory needed to grow a spine. Her ability to read people's minds was never really explained. The romantic parts were really quite nauseating.I skipped to the end and found out who the killer was but it just didn't make sense to me.I like Nora Roberts, but this one was quite disappointing."
3,Average for Roberts,"I've only read one other Nora Roberts book, Three Fates, I thought it was great. This one was a little more predictable. Though I couldn't figure out who the real killer was, I knew it wasn't the ""usual suspect"". The writing was wonderful and the characters were very well developed. However, the plot wasn't fascinating. It was a typical story and didn't leave me feeling fulfilled at the end."
2,Not my favorite,"I typically like Nora Roberts books, they are fun, quick, and a little twist at the end. This one just didn't do much for me. I realized I had read over half of the book before anything happened! There were just too many words and not enough story. I never really cared for the characters, none of them were convincing to me. I liked the end and had it figured out long before I got to it, but the book ended so abruptly. It felt like the author had to get a certain number of pages, got there, wrapped it up and got it published."
2,Yuk.....,"This book is the first I have ever not been able to finish. I think Nora Roberts is a poor author. I don't know if it is because she used too many adjectives or because she jumps around in time too much, but I found this book to be too confusing. Her character descriptions do not offer anything concrete to remember the character by... so you are constantly trying to remember who she is talking about. Also, there are too many characters - which also confuses the story. I lost my concentration so much that I finally gave up and put it up for auction on Amazon, thank goodness I got most of my money back."
1,Carolina Bore,"I hated this book. I guessed ""whodunit"" about half-way through. I did not like any of the characters - Tory's repeated proclamations about her independence became tiresome very quickly. I thought Cade was whimpy and Faith's character inconsistent. The remainder of the characters were poorly drawn. I was so bored with the plot that I skimmed the last 20 or so pages just to finish what I started."
2,What a disappointment!,"I was hoping to finish this book, and respond with 'of course, I should have figured that out!'. But instead, I said 'give me a break'! A good mystery must be mysterious and not easily solved; but it also must all come together in the end. I am sorry, but this one doesn't. She could have chosen anyone of the 20 or so characters and had the same result. Come on Nora, you can do better. I have read previous Nora Roberts books and quite enjoyed them, even if I did figure out the mystery before it was revealed. But this one, I just don't buy! Don't waste your time on it. There are too many really good books out there. Choose wisely."
1,Wonderful story ruined by the narrator!,"Nora Roberts is a wonderful author. I cannot believe she allowed this narrator to read her best story yet. She reads in a hurried raspy monotone with no change in voice between characters. I have to keep rewinding to figure out who is talking. Couldn't stand it...bought the book--great book, terrible audio."
1,Yuck!,"I have to say I was pretty intrigued throughout most of the book, but the ending was horrible. I had so many questions that weren't answered and there was absolutely no logic to the reason Hope died, the other killings and especially why if the killer was bent on ""killing Hope over and over again"" that Faith -- who was Hope's identical twin! -- was never in any danger! I was very disappointed in the ending."
2,Tedious,"I looked forward eagerly after reading 5 star reviews of this book. I was supremely disappointed.The writing does not flow smoothly; it does not capture and hold my interest. The characters are not all that likeable.Nora does write well often, but not in this book. I was plain bored. I would like to see more books such as ""Divine Evil"", or ""Homeport""."
1,"Love the book. Hate the ""reader"" in Audio version","Carolina Moon is one of my favourite Nora Roberts books and one I have re-read many times. However, I recently purchased the Unabridged, Audio CD version and it is by far the WORST audio book I have ever listened to. The reader is practically monotone and makes NO effort to provide different voices for the various characters. I could barely make it through the first few chapters before I quit.My recommendation: Read the book, it's fabulous. But DON'T waste your money on the audio version."
3,Not my favorite Nora Roberts...,"For such a prolific author, Nora Roberts sure spins some fantastic tales.This is the tale of a cursed woman. She can find things, she can see things. She can read people.When she was a child, her best friend was murdered. And her own father beat her regularaly, trying to rid her of the devil.The majority of the story involves her tackling her own demons.There's nothing really new in this story. There are so many characters and so much back story that I felt none were really given the time they needed to flesh out their motivations.Definitely not my favorite NR book.(*)>"
4,Somewhat Disappointed,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and thus was somewhat disappointed with Carolina Moon. It is the story of an empath who returns to her hometown after a 10 year absence to open a business and look into the murder of her childhood friend 10 years before. With the help of the victims brother ( the love interest)Tory tries to solve the old murder and new murders she ""feels"" are coming. I found the characters developemnt slow in this book and felt I never really got to know the two main leads. The romance was somewhat contrived. However the second half of the book picked up when the suspects began to grow. A decent read, but not riviting."
2,"Writing is great, subject too disturbing","I usually enjoy NR's books, but I found this plot to be too weird and off-the-wall to enjoy. The writing, as always, is top-notch, and it certainly kept my attention, but I don't expect it to be a book I reread often, if ever. There are serial killer plots I've found interesting before, but since what I found interesting about them was the police work behind the search, this didn't provoke the same interest. I was just too disturbed by the plot to be able to appreciate the book."
2,Disappointing,"The story starts off promising as Nora Roberts sets the stage for her mystery. However, about halfway through the book the story gets bogged down and becomes predictable. The characters become cookie-cutter, and the story sort of veers off on a couple of tangents.The character of Dwight pops up at seemingly inopportune times in the story, and because Nora draws attention to him by doing that, it kind of gave the story away, in my opinion.I stopped reading the book for a few weeks because I was bored with it, and when I picked it up a few weeks later, the story unfolded just as I suspected.I love Nora's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Derivative but a pretty good read,"If you liked Linda Howard's After the Night (poor white trash girl makes good and comes home to solve old mystery), Linda Howard's Dream Man (misunderstood psychic helps catch serial killer), or Carol O'Connell's Judas Child (""left behind"" child grows up and returns to home town to help catch killer of childhood friend), then you'll like Carolina Moon. I did."
3,"okay, not great","This was a good beach read, but not the best NR book I have ever read. The plot has been recycled, reading like ""Carnal Innocence"". The editting bothered me: not only the timeline, but the repeated use here (and in other NR books) of the word ""undo"". It should read ""undue influence"" or ""undue effort"". The two words mean completely different things (unnecessary vs. come undone) and are NOT interchangable. Does the editor not own a dictionary?"
4,Yet another great one,This is yet another great book. I have become quite a fan of Nora Roberts in recent months as I have begun to discover her amazing talent to captivate and enchant and surprise. I look forward to another adventure with her.
5,carolina moon,"I absolutely love Nora Roberts. She knows exactly how to keep you entertained until the very end of the book, quite literally as I belive you dont find out who the real killer is until the last couple pages!! She knows how to keep you guessing, until you almost just want to skip to the end to find the killer that way! She knows just how to disguise the real killer, and yet give subtle hints as to who he is. This may be a graphic book, but its well worth the reading time! What a page turner!"
4,Intrigue and romance,"Tory Bodeen returns to her childhood home in South Carolina to open a store and reclaim her life there. The return is difficult for her because she has to face the memories of her best friend, Hope, who was killed at age 8 when she went to a swamp for a midnight rendezvous with Tory. Tory never made it to the swamp because her father beat her so badly that she couldn't go. She was able to picture Hope's death in her mind and always afterward felt guilty for not being around to protect her friend. Now she is grown up, but prejudices and hatreds still remain in her hometown. This book has a pleasing mixture of romance and mystery and the author spins an interesting tale."
1,Don't listen to the audio version!!,"I'm writing this review for anyone who might be thinking about listening to the audio version. It is the worst audiobook to which I've listened! The reader poorly conveyed emotion of the characters in conversation, sometimes, I think, messing up what was actually being said. What was worse was trying to figure out who was actually speaking since all characters had the same accent, voice, and expression. I'm really disappointed that I didn't actually read this book...I think it would have been a decent suspense read!"
3,Carolina Moon,"After reading Carnal Innocence, I was most anxiously awaiting Nora Robert's new book. Although an enjoyable read, it was nowhere near the books of Carnal Innocence or River's End. The book did not flow, it was written very choppily which made difficult reading. After reading the above two, I wondered if it was written by the same author. Do they sometimes do an outline and let someone else fill it in? It certainly wasn't the caliber I expected of Nora Roberts. Also, the situation with Cade's mother was not developed and was left dangling and was Faith (his sister) and Wade's relationship. The ending was abrupt. I was disappointed this time."
3,Good Reading,"This was my first Nora Roberts book. It's not my most favorite book but I must admit that it kept my interest. This author provides very detailed narratives of the surroundings and the atmosphere of each a every scene without becoming boring. My favorite characters were Cade and Wade. Both men with such different personalities and yet so alike when it came to their feelings of love and dedication. I could've easily fallen in love with either one of them! lol! Faith provided the comic relief as well as Rosie and Isis. All in all, a good story that kept me entertained."
3,my review,"This book is about the story of a girl, Tory. Her struggle to regain control of her life after a very difficult childhood and the death of her best friend.This is one of the first times I have read a book by Nora Roberts who also deals with mystery mixed with romance. In this book it is a good mix.The plot is very well thought out and the writing is interesting and real. The characters are all very well described as well as the places.This is a great refreshing and very interesting book. Well recommended."
5,Another Classic from the Best of Romantic Suspense,"As a HUGE fan and owner of all her books (including one autographed copy), I have to say that this is probably one of the BEST of Nora Roberts' romantic suspense. From the very beginning you just grab onto the characters and can't let go. The only bad thing is the inability to put in down... I was late for work. Thanks, Nora for another great book... Now I'll just have to wait for the next one!"
4,Great read!,"I love Nora Roberts books and this one is just as good as the others. I was surprised by the ending, loved the 2 romances, and really enjoyed the way the characters evolved in the story - especially Faith."
5,Sensational,"This was by far one of the best Nora Roberts books I've read. The book took many turns which made it a page turner and kept you interested. It didn't take long to read, because I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this one!"
5,GREAT,Years ago this was first Nora read.... Love and mystery! It has still remained my favorite. I loved the twist at the end who new? Read this book and wait for the crazy end... WOW!
4,Pure Enjoyment,"I have been reading Nora Roberts books for quite some time. I truely enjoyed reading Carolina Moon as much as I have enjoyed her other books. The charachters came alive and enchanted me not to mention the terrific surprise ending . The best part about reading Carolina Moon is the simple fact that it was pure enjoyment. Curled up on the couch in front of a fire on a rainy Sunday I was transported to the South with Cade and Tori, and Faith and Wade. It was a great way to relax and be entertained. I hope you enjoy Carolina Moon as much as I did."
5,Miles - what is there else to say,"Mr Davis is the King, not the orginal crew, but he knew what he was doing over so many different styles of our best music that NO ONE has the claim to that title. Original, Inventive, Pure"
5,Walkin' and listenin',"Listen to this album once, listen to it again and again. The listener is treated to a new experience with each time it is spun on the cd player and enjoyed on an mp3 player. It is cool and doesn't overpower the listener with overly ""syrupy"" notes that are more like pop than jazz. The cover information tells the history but the listener will appreciate the fine chemistry on this recording. Go for it."
1,Classic Junk,"By todays standard this album is antiquated junk. How does anyone listen to this crap is beyond me. So many talented Jazz artist, why go back to listen to this shit. Few past artists are worth listening Dave Brubeck, and Dizzy are great."
2,"Over priced, noisy, heavy, and slow.","I bough these clippers wanting a very good set of cordless clippers. I thought that is what I would get because of the price. I use them on horses. I have a old set of $60 clippers and wanted to get something better. These oster clippers are slow, vibrate, and make noise which isn't good for horses plus they don't cut good in heavy leg hair. They keep stalling. My old clippers that are worn out do a better job. Don't buy these expecting to have a professional set of clippers. They are over priced by a factor of 3. They do have a nice box and charger though so if you want to look good but don't want to clip hair they would be ok."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"bought the Oster Power Pro Ultra and used it once, and it is kaput now. will be sending it in to warranty, but have now read ALL the reports and this unit seems to do that. charger light says good to go, but no motor action. very bummed, cause besides the metal plate on the blade getting hot, it did a fantastic job....just wont work now.When I did use it that first time, the metal blade also got very hot so took a few clipping sessions over a 2 hour period to get my already shaved australian shephard finished."
2,GREAT CLIPPERS! TERRIBLE BATTERIES!,Disappointed for the money :( I will probably never buy cordless again! Horses get too impatient!
5,"Finally, a pet grooming tool that is just perfect.","This clipper is wonderful and well worth the price. When I cannot bring my long-haired cat to the groomers, I trim the long fur at home during the hot summer months. The motor on these clippers is pretty quiet, compared to the corded trimmers I have used before. When trimming your pet's fur, cordless is the only way to go and they will run away.Cons: after long storage you have to charge the battery before use. Sometimes runs out of charge if you run it for a long period of time."
1,I never received it so I hate it.,"I ordered two of these from Newbolz at Amazon, paid for them, was informed that I could not change the order. Then I was informed that the items were destroyed at their place of business and they cancelled the order. Very suspecious. Don't do business with these people. Jan"
5,Love them!,"The cordless power pro clippers are very durable, lighter than expected and worth every penny."
4,"Dark, but well told story","Very violent and some sexuality, including rape. The hero is noble and good. He even makes a moving sacrifice at the end. The villain is completely evil. His actions throughout are disturbing. The art is rough, like a book of quickly drawn storyboards. Which is fitting since the author works for Pixar as a storyboard artist."
2,The Downward Spiral,"I wanted to like these books. The concept of America rising from the ashes of World War III with Super Battle Armor was intriguing... especially to a teenage boy. But even back then I was not overly impressed with the writing, and quickly grew tired of the more and more explicit (gory) death scenes. And how many of the suits can be blown to pieces before a war ravaged county runs out?These books grew progressively worse and tiresome, but early on there was a spark; a small spark, but a spark. Had the books moved forward in time towards a conclusion, it would have done much more to keep the long term story interesting."
1,"Toshiba CZ36V61 36"" TV",Received the TV and enjoyed it for 2 months and then it broke! I am in the process now of trying to get it repaired and this is turning into a difficult ordeal. I would not recommened Toshiba to anyone.
2,jewelry review,"Jewish star was purchased for my adult son. Although it is attractive, it is much too flimsy for a man to wear. I was very disappointed with the weight of the star, also. It appear in the picture to be a more substantial piece of jewelry."
5,"Thought-provoking, compassionate, and erudite","I absolutely love this book, esp. the chapters on Bourke-White et al, and on Warhol and Basquiat. I agree with previous reviewers that this is a book full of soul by a writer and artist who loves and understands the creative process. This is a great text to teach with my upper-level undergraduates. I highly recommend it even for those only mindly interested in art, as an erudite page-turner that will make you think."
2,Average performances - terrible sound quality,"I needed a recording of the ""Alle Rustica"" RV 151 in a hurry. Too bad for me. The sound is dark and very muddy as if it was recorded in the bottom of a well. Not recommended."
3,"Five stars to Hamelin, but this music is trite and annoying","Hamelin appears to be in search of some niche, and it seems that he decided to concentrate on technically super-demanding and obscure repertory. I regret this very much, because he is a fantastic pianist, but he ends up playing a lot of garbage I don't want to hear no matter how well played (like Medtner, Reger, Alcan, and now Kapustin). Kapustin's music is written-out jazz: that is, it's idiomatically jazz but sans improvisation. As jazz pieces they're busy but not inventive or original, so what's the point? You can hear this sort of music on any good jazz pianist's record (and know that the guy is making it up as he goes).Hamelin gets five stars, Kapustin gets one star, three stars overall.I wish Hamelin issued more stuff like his Scriabin sonatas collection. Isn't there more music like that: difficult, yet, nevertheless, listenable?"
5,FMA playing cards,"These cards are well-made and fun to use, especially for fans of the show. Each card is different and fully illustrated. Some images were created for use in calendars, promotions, etc., and others are based on scenes from the show. As long as the children are old enough to use playing cards(the box recommends age 7 and up), durability should not be a problem. Although none of the images on the cards are gory, parents should be advised that a few are mildly violent, and that the animation on which this toy is based contains mature themes and is not appropriate for children under the age of fourteen."
1,thins is a f%^&kin pice of crap!!!!!!!!,i got this on my b-day i was so excited i opend him out of the box and his head broke off! i put it back on it kept on falling off its no fun no way and if u do move it to much all the joints will fall off and when you put them back on they will fall offmy philosphy is if you shake a action figure and its joinsts mave you now its time to start saving up again to get a new action figure
2,What happened?,"Thundercracker looks good in jet mode but loses a lot in the transition to robot mode. He's a skinny, gangly figure with almost non-existent feet and a missile launcher arm nearly longer than his whole body. Amazingly, though, he can actually stand without support if you spread his legs a bit. The plastic on him feels flimsy compared to other Cybertron figures, even the smaller Scout class ones. I bought him to complete the series, but any child looking for some hard play value from him could wind up with a broken toy if they're not careful."
2,Flimsy shoulder joint ruins this toy,"Looks awesome in jet mode, but like the first reviewer states, the left shoulder will not stay in place, and theirs no hand on that arm, just a huge cannon. Sucks because he would have been pretty cool, now i just keep him in jet mode. Robot mode blows.And my girlfriend keeps pointing his toes and makes him look like he's doing ballet. There is something wrong with her too."
3,Weak Design Dooms this figure,"I'll give it 3 stars overall because Thundercracker does look good in his jet mode (althought nothing compares to the original). But as others have pointed out the trouble is in robot mode when you convert him using the Cyber key. The figure is just to light and skinny and looks like something out of the 1950's. There's no Anime look whatsover. And yes, the joints are way too weak to make this figure decently posable. What a shame that a classic character gets such a short shrift."
1,A Floppy Mess,"This figure is absolutely atrocious. I'll admit that the jet mode looks kind of neat, the transformation is fun, and the robot head is cool, but the compliments end there. The gimmick is lame. That is the only way to describe it. Scattorshot flips up a missile pod, Wreckloose springs two antlers out of a shield, and Mudflap unfolds a blade out of his crane arm. What does Thundercracker do? His gun opens slightly. Speaking of which, his ""gun arm"" is a chunk of airplane fuselage at best. This brings me to the biggest problem with this figure. . .NOTHING CLIPS TOGETHER IN ROBOT MODE!!! He is also so top heavy and his feet are so small that he can't stand without leaning up against something. Final Thoughts: Avoid this figure like the plague."
3,Ugh!,"My son is big into Transformers right now, and he was oohing and ahhing over Thundercracker for Christmas. I was really disappointed when it broke in 2 not more than 20 minutes after the box was opened. The transformation is a little much for the kiddies I think, and they lose interest in it after a short time. I am being more than fair with my scoring of this item, as any toy that breaks the same day it is opened shouldn't even be on the market."
2,Poor connectors - Better for stranded,"BlueMall claimed these connectors are for solid cable, but they don't crimp properly. The pins bend to the sides of the cable and don't make a good connection. Not worth my time or money to try and return a $5 item. Probably won't buy from this seller again for what is either false advertising or poor quality product. They'd probably work fine for stranded though..."
2,Not optimal for solid conductors,"These 8P8C ends claim they are for solid cable, but the packaging says 'stranded/solid'. If you look at the connectors they are the cheaper stranded type 2-prong instead of the 3 splayed prong normally used for solid conductors. It might work, but it's definitely not optimal and definitely not as described."
2,"Good connections, but won't stay in","I'm glad I bought the stress-relieving boots as I use them to force the tab up, otherwise most of these just fall back out."
1,The quality control on this is simply awful.,I went thru 11 of the before find ONE that was good.I threw the entire bag out.It is too much time to connect one only to find it is bad.With shipping this cost $4.35 Complete waste of time and money.Cost me more to return it than it is worth...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
1,Connectors are not designed for solid core wire,"While this product works OK on stranded wire, the contacts inside the connector are not designed for solid core wire. They are designed exclusively for stranded wire."
4,good for the price,"I've been using these to crimp cables for my home office. They're your basic cat-5 connectors, nothing terribly surprising. I do find a connector in the bag from time to time that has trouble making a solid connection with the wire. I have yet to have one that didn't work after another firm press in the crimping tool though."
5,Great fun for juvenile series books fans.,"An old-time fan reminisces about the reading exploits of his youth in a light-hearted, often humorous manner. Mr. Prager gives a good accounting of Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, the Rover Boys and many lesser-known juvenile series book heroes. A must read for fans of the genre."
4,mattress with a frame,the mattress on the frame feels almost like you are sleeping in a bed. It is quick and easy to set up . The wheeled case makes it convenient to transport. You can use it for camping or when you need an extra bed for guests at home.
2,THE SPORTSMAN GUIDE IS THE VERY BEST COMPANY!,"This item began to buckle under the weight of my apprx 200 lb mother after a week or two....BUT The Sportsman Guide came through with flying colors, providing INSTANT RESPONSES TO MY E-MAILS and provided a FULL REFUND for the used bed even after a few months. (We had purchased it in advance of my Mom's visit.) The bed would be fine for a lighter-weight person. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE IS THE VERY BEST ... POSSESSING OLD-TIME INTEGRITY AND VALUES and ACTUALLY PROVIDING EXCELLENT SERVICE SO SADLY LACKING BY OTHERS IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. If you are contemplating purchasing something from them, GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE WITHOUT FEAR!! Lovely, heart-warming experience!! =)"
4,Well Done!,"This translation of the Shang Han Lun is well done! I have been in a ten month long class taught by Arnaud Versluys and this book has been a great addition to his teachings. It is well laid out and since I am in the process of learning to read and write medical Chinese, I have found the addition in Chinese to be indispensable. The chapters are well structured as to pattern presentation and herbal prescriptions. It is also a valuable book in any practitioner of Chinese Medicine's library! Don't miss out!"
1,All form and no substance,"I would like to point out a few things about this book. Yes, I do have a personal beef with a translator who has a book signing. I mean the real star here is the Shang Han Lun, not him.1) Most important point, though no one will say it, this is not a real translation of the classical Shang Han Lun. It is a translation of a translation into modern Chinese. As one esteemed Chinese teacher said, when listing books that needed to be written into english;"" We need a new translation of the Shang Han Lun, not the Easy Shang Han Lun.""2) Notice that the comentaries are not by Mitchell, but instead by a Shang Han Lun expert in China. This means that you do not get any kind of cross cultural translation.You are better off getting a much less expensive, old copy of the Shang Han Lun and reading that."
2,Book,"Not a very good method for me.. Packed well, came quickl, would do business with this company again. Looks just like picture advertised."
1,Fits a small space but not the user,"I received this keyboard as a gift. This is the ideal model for a small space, the keys themselves have an excellent feel and it has good construction quality.Unfortunately, there are two glaring problems with this keyboard that make it virtually unusable. Foremost is the fact that it has a legacy AT-style adapter on the cable. This should be emphasized more in the product description, most people will expect either a PS/2 or a USB connection.The most glaring deficiency, however, is the placement of the arrow keys in such a non-standard orientation. The arrow key up should be where the shift key is located, it is impossible for me to use this keyboard without constant typographical errors."
2,Incomplete product,I don't understand why this keyboard isn't equiped with a modern day connector or at least emphatically warn customers of the need for one when they order. The keyboard works fine once you can hook it up but my buying experience was less than stellar getting a product that wouldn't work out of the box.
2,"Not bad, but I've read better","While I agree with the previous reviews that this book has some charming aspects (Lily's study of the ""Male mysteries""; the unlikely villan), overall I was very disappointed. My particular complaints with this novel are the unfounded, mecurial temperaments of it's main characters. One paragraph they're verbally assaulting one another, and the next whispering endearments with no apparent resolution to the previous confrontation. Also, the book moved so slowly at times, I found myself skipping pages to more interesting parts. However, I applaud Ms. Cameron on her antagonists. A more motley, thoroughly amoral group has never existed."
5,Awesome Cybertron,"For 10 bucks you get a great looking police car with an action feature that is pretty decent with the canons popping out at the sides. The transformation is challenging and fun, not overly complicated. It looks pretty great in robot mode too. This is a great one for this line along with Evac (the helicopter with working winch) and Downshift (70s styled muscle car that is probably the best looking car in the series), who Red Alert can chase on your display shelf or in your playtime."
4,Pleasant but not tier 1 concertos,These are fun but quite frankly like many in this series you will not remember it. But it is not mediocre....just not the level of a Beethoven or Rachmaninoff. I do recommend the entire Hyperion romantic concerto library.
1,"Just awful - frays, unravels and pills even before use!","Wow, we weren't expecting a ton from these pads, and we certainly didn't get it. My wife likes to wash baby things before we use them, and I think that's a prudent enough policy.When these came out of the washer BEFORE their first use, the stitches on the sides had become at least half-unraveled and the pilling was more severe than on any product I've seen before in my life, to my memory.I mean, really bad. Don't waste your money on these! Just awful.I must admit they are waterproof. So that's the one criteria they do meet. So if that's ALL that counts for you, go for it."
1,Very poor quality material,"After returning the Organic pads that piled after their first wash, I ordered these. UNBELIEVABLY they did the SAME thing?! As always, Amazon shipped them in lightening speed, I threw them in the wash to start using them immediately, when to my surprise they piled and frayed in the wash. I returned them promptly for a refund. If I had anything positive to say it would be that the size is generous. However, the polyester-nylon-type material wouldn't have been soft on my baby's bum even IF they would have held up to a washing machine."
2,"does the job, but scratchy (not soft) even after washing","This does the trick as waterproof pads go and washes and dries just fine - however, it is not all that soft and given cribs, changing pads, bassinets are more of a rectangle than a square, the shape (square) is a bit odd."
5,Every Sentence Crackles,"A Dublin bookshop offered this gem up to me when I was visiting Ireland in the early 90's, and probably a year has not gone by since 1991 when I haven't reread The Portable Virgin. It's smart, edgy, and hysterically funny. It's also an entirely original take on what contemporary Irish consciousness is like. Every friend to whom I've lent my dog-eared copy threatens to steal the book from me. Sadly, it's out of print, but an American publisher would be wise to print up another 50,000 copies."
1,Wish I had seen it,"I tried ordering this VHS tape several times before, to my delight, I finally succeeded in getting it. This review is on the physical product. It came in what seemed a partially damaged, ultra-cheap VHS package. I put it in a perfectly good VCR that worked fine before and after I tried to play this tape. Anyway, as soon as I put the tape in, my machine made an unholy noise and when I stopped and ejected the tape was hung up in my machine. Ended up tearing it out. Great film, poor delivery. Save your ten bucks."
2,Very Weak Revival,"Like many of the reviews, I agree this revival is a disappointment. As a fan of Vanessa Williams, I think too it was a mistake for her to played the witch. I enjoy original Into the Woods cast better."
1,Doesn't hold a candle to the original,"None of the principals hold a candle to the original. This CD is a testimony to the sad state of Broadway. In one word- if you want a recording of ITW, buy the original recording!"
2,Lifeless,"Until I got this CD home, I was unaware that this rewritten ""revival"" existed, and I do wish I had continued in that state of happy ignorance. If zombies on Valium had been engaged to perform, they could hardly have made the music more lifeless than this recording does.I understand wanting to interpret roles anew. But even new interpretations should be imbued with sparkle of some kind (unless, of course, one is doing the aforesaid Druggie Zombie version). I bought this CD at a local store, and back it goes.If anyone wants to see a lovely version -- so much better than the ""2002 Broadway Revival"" -- search Youtube for ""Into the Woods Cleveland HS"". The high school students are wonderful. It's a pity their performance isn't available here. I'd buy it."
3,Nothing over the original,"My flatmate and I listened to this recording, both being fans of the OBC. And we were constantly looking at each other in disbelief. We both couldn't get over Vanessa Williams lack of expression and the number of times the recording sounded a little off.revival casts are meant to improve on the first, this one matched at times and came lower other times.only buy if you're a fan. the packaging is equally disappointing. For a show so rich in texture, i would assume a more mature sense of design.i definitely would only listen to this one more than twice if i were to stage the piece."
1,Children won't listen to this recording,"Stephen Sondheim is a genius of musical theatre that's for certain. Into the woods is my all time favorite musical. I was really excited to hear they were going to do a revival of it with Vanessa Williams as the witch? Sounds great right?...Not so much. Vanessa isn't as great as you hope, and for some reason Shephen thought it would be a good idea to write new parts for almost every song or throw in every he cut from the first time. TO be perfectly honest this is the worst of the three recordings. Get the Broadway or (my favorite) the London recording. Do not waste your money or time with this one"
1,for collectors only!,"I bought this CD because I'm a fan of Sondheim in general, and especially of Woods. However, after seeing the revival production twice, I knew this was going to be one step down from the original cast recording, but I had high hopes.Alas, even in the studio, this cast cannot come near to competing with its successor. The only cast members who hold their own are Laura Benanti and Kerry O'Malley, and even then, it's difficult sitting through the other performances. If you don't know the show yet, by the Original Cast Recording! The only thing you'd get out of this one would be the few changes that have been made-- if you really want to hear those, make sure you get the other recording as well!"
2,Why Bother?,"The 2002 Revival of Into The Woods, pales in comparison to the original 1987 production. Vanessa Williams was not right for this role, and she lacked the emotion needed for the part of the witch. I kept waiting for Bernadette Peters' wonderful voice to pop out of nowhere and stop Vanessa Williams from singing. I would advise you NOT to buy this CD."
3,Umm......,"I was so excited to have another recording of this gem. I must say that I am disappointed. The original Broadway cast far outshines this revival cast (with a few exceptions). Vanessa Williams has a marvelous voice and shines in the ballads, but she doesn't make a very menacing witch. Jack - no thanks! The Baker and his wife - nice, but not Zien/Gleason. Jack's mother - I'm not sure I have a descriptor for this travesty. Little Red needs to have more attitude. The shining memeber of this cast is Laura Benanti as Cinderella. It is so nice to not hear Kim Crosby overacting and warbling her way through the role.Not a terrible recording (The London Cast) but nothing outshines the original!"
2,Stephen SOndheim is SO overrated!!,Sondheim has written a few beautiful songs but most of it is just tuneless melodies that arn't that good.
3,Not Quite the Same,"This recording of Into the Woods is... okay. Vanessa Williams just doesn't have the power and oomph that Bernadette Peters had in the same role. I think it would have been wiser to wait another 10 years before reviving this show. The original production is still fresh in people's minds. And I'm sorry, but the ultimate Baker's Wife will always be Joanna Gleason. The wife in revival, (I don't even know her name) doesn't play the part with enough emotion. Now, I realize that all I have done is put down the recording, yet I gave it three stars. Well it looses all the stars for having a mediocre cast, but gains back three of them for being one of Stephen Sondhiem's best scores ever.So, if you want the best recording of Into the Woods, you'd be better off with the 1988 cast recording, but if you're a big fan of Sondhiem, then you just might get a kick out of it."
3,Good with one MAJOR EXCEPTION,"I saw the show in NYC in previews and enjoyed it a lot. I have also enjoyed the new cast album but must say that the two important duets of ""Agony"" are truly agony to listen to. Quite the worst broadway singing I have ever heard on a recording. The voices have no blend, are terribly flat and unsteady, also they sound quite hoarse. The singers don't even appear to be singing the correct notes. Shame on you Nonesuch Records for letting it be released like that, but perhaps that was the best they could do at the recording session. Really too bad.Oddly enough it didn't sound like that in the theater, it wasn't a great moment, but it wasn't terrible like it is on the recording.I like Vanessa Williams a lot, and also the Cinderella of Laura Benanti is really lovely.Buy this recording but beware you will skip over those two duets every time you play it!"
5,A great investment!,This well-written book has been immensely helpful in bringing me up to speed on R/3 change management practices. It certainly goes far beyond R/3 on-line help. It is both well-organized and of great depth and breadth. The glossary alone was worth the purchase price.
2,Average book,I have read about 4 books on basis administration and I dint find this one any differant. They all have basically the same content. Not worth the price
4,Old time Gospel,"This CD is a step between his ""The Troublemaker"" CD and ""Gospel Favorites"". While it has more instrumental and vocal support than ""Gospel Favorites"", it is not in the same league as his great ""The Troublemaker"" album. Originally recorded in 1986, this CD is a collection of old Gospel standards. Willie's performances are very good and his sister, Bobbie does a good job on piano. Willie also provides backing vocals for himself on here. All-in-all, a pretty good CD. I would recommend it."
5,Wille Nelson at his best!,This is my favorite Willie Nelson cd! I was looking for a cd with old gospel music and this was the answer. This is a great cd filled with all the classic old gospel favorites and played by the legendary Wille Nelson. Willie finds a way to to play these songs like nobody else could. Listening to this music brings back so many memories for me and I love this album!
5,Good camera strap,I had broken the old strap on my camera and this is a perfect replacement. The item arrived quickly and exactly as described.
3,"OK, lanyard too thick, strap too big","I bought this for my Sony Ericsson k750i cell phone (which has a fairly good camera) for when I'm using the camera extensively as I find it safer to have the camera on a wrist strap while walking around.Two problems I've found: the lanyard is a bit thick, which makes it pretty difficult to loop it through the slot which is provided for this purpose on the camera.Also, the strap is a little too big, which means it can inadvertently slip off my wrist. I fixed this by tying a knot near the end, effectively shortening the loop, but it's an inelegant solution.One other thing: since Amazon asked me to, I rate the ""Picture Quality"" of this product, um, er..."
1,Never Got To Use It,I never used it the camera I bought it for was sent back before I used it. This again is an inexpensive item that cost more due to shipping costs.
2,Too much nonsense,"Don't be expected to be blown away by the logic in this book, or the conclusions that are derived thereof. The logic gaps in much of this book are tremendous. A pantheist may find this book to be enlightening but don't expect to be convinced if you aren't already so inclined.It is not hard to understand from this book why de Chardin was censured by the Catholic Church. It is not quite as simple as the fact that he espoused evloution, as a previous review would imply. The Church does not have a problem with evolution. It does, however, have a problem with one of its priests claiming that inanimate matter possesses consciousness.There is no doubting de Chardin's intellect and genius, as well as his mystical tendencies, and it shines through rather well in this book. However, at times it seems he is either too intelligent or too mystical for his own good. In the end I was struck by the fact that large sections of this book seemed to be nothing more than intelligent sounding gibberish."
1,here's a fun quote,"""Nevertheless, I was irresisibly reminded of Peter Medawar's comment on Father Teilhard de Chardin's THE PHENOMENON OF MAN, in the course of what is possibly the greatest negative book review of all time: 'its author can be excused of dishonesty only the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.'""From Richard Dawkin'sThe God Delusion."
1,Hackneyed reworking of atheist theory,"The main ethos of this text, that human evolution converges with an archetype of the divine, is an old ideal, first purposed by Nietzsche as the ""Ubermensch."" This is not the only troubling dynamic of this book, however, as the entire basis, a reconciliation between evolutionary science, and the biblical creation, is faulty at best, and impossible in reality.Unfortunately for M. Chardin, his working does not break, crack, or even reach this barrier of failure. With its intermingling of atheist ideology, with irreconcilable creationist theory, it is a fractured effort that must err on the side of theosophy, and not philosophy (and most certainly not science)."
1,Wordy Waffle - not a shred of value in it!,"There are plenty of books this bad, pages of tosh cobbled together to sound impressive, but actually saying nothing. To those reviewers who see the work as providing things of value, I would simply ask; in one sentence say one thing that this book offers that is new, different or useful."
4,Plowing through Teilhard,"Teilhard is difficult to read but worth the effort--IF you're interested enough to make the effort (I am) and IF you can attune yourself to the now-arcane style of writing. IF you are so inclined, the rewards are worth it. You get a glimpse into what has evolved from ancient Buddhism, and probably begin showing up in a Western iteration first with Alfred North Whitehead and eventually into General Systems Theory. Fascinating and relevant if you are a student of spirituality--and who isn't if we're honest?"
4,Cover-to-cover in one day,"In a terse, unadorned style reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway, Stesiak provides an insight into what makes a soldier tick. I came away understanding why these men call one another 'brother'."
2,"Unlike ""Sweet Land""","I bought this book after seeing the movie ""Sweet Land"". I didn't expect too much similarity since one is a short story and the other is a full length movie. However, everything that I felt made the movie unique and of substance as film was absent in a literary sense from this collection of stories. I'm not really criticizing the collection of short stories and if you're reading it based on your experience with the author you may be pleased. But if you are purchasing these stories based on a favorable impression from the movie then you may find them dissimilar and be disappointed."
4,Regaining my youth,"I have been very pleased with this kit. However I have not done any serious airplane modelling for 50 years, nor yet finished the model.Difficulty: Not for a beginner, but for an intermediate. The laser-cut parts are impressively accurate. I did have to learn a new (for me) technique in laminating balsa strips.Quality: Very good. Excellent design, clear plans, sufficient materials of good quality. So far it appears to be an excellent reproduction of the old Moth.Completeness. As expected, you will need various glues, modelling tools, dope, and the radio control gear.Flight: Ah! We shall see.Satisfaction. Very high so far.Durability? This is one of the attributes requested for a ""toy"" review. However, we are describing a scale flying model, which will be necessarily light, and therefore fragile.Durable is not a relevant term in my modelling experience.Fun: Yes. Educational: Yes. Modelling requires patience, care and attention to detail."
3,Allan Gurgnus' Fourth Novel of Novellas,"I have read all of Mr. Gurganus' catalog. ""The Practical Heart"" being his last. I liked the book but had problems with the first novella, the book's namesake ""The Practical Heart"" I found it choppy with to many flashforwards and flashbacks somehow the story gets lost in all of them. ""Preservation News"" was wonderful about a dying gay man who saves old houses, as was ""He's One To"" about a gay man who is outed when he is traped in a public restroom hitting on the cheif of Police's son. ""Saint Monster"" stands as the best of the four novellas in depth. It is about the son of man who delivers Bibles to motels and his mother who has a motel mentality making love to the town vet while father and son are away. His search after his father dies to find out more about him and eventually how to come to terms with his mother. I found the writing in ""Saint Monster"" similar to one of John Irving's twisted plots and I mean that in a good way. I like John Irving."
5,Praise from an impractical heart...,"Allan is what they call an ""old soul""---someone whose compassion and wisdom seem beyond what we are capable of seeing and understanding, and make us wish to become finer and nobler induviduals. Unlike so many modern novelists, his work is void of condecension and cynicism. I hope he finds the man who 'is one too..."" If not, here at least is one who understands..."
2,The Confessions of St. Augustine,Written in a way making understanding difficult. This could have been translated in a more interesting and reader friendly manner. Very disappointing.
5,Great and uplifting CD.,This CD is powerful! Your spirits will be uplifted immediately. You can praise God where ever you are.
4,Old school Kirk,If you are searching for old school Kirk Franklin CD then this is it. The only song that was different from what I expected was the silver and gold song. Other than that the cd was what I expected and then some.
4,a complex but fun read,"This is a pretty twisted book,which blends a kaleidescopic array of mathematical concepts with surreal and enigmatic situations and inncidents.There's some really colourful writing here,and it's very impressive the way Rucker brings to life the various chaos and infinity theorems.VERY out-there cybermetaphysipunk!!"
3,Mathematics - Cyber Punk Style,"Blaze` math professor at an obscure university experiences astral projection and embarks on the trip of a lifetime in search of infinity and what lies beyond. Wild associations and images induced by drug abuse and alcohol intoxication constitue the core of this not so fresh cyber punk novel. Recommended on a dull winter day (or night) in the northern hemisphere. Definitively captivating and intriguing with a mind boggling plot. If you are lucky, you might find out what ALEF-NULL stands for..."
1,Bad book. Bad bad book.,"...This was a bad book for me. I perseverved to the end and regretted doing so. Like someone else wrote, I felt I was missing some sort of inside joke. I have read other works by this writer and enjoyed them; this book disappointed, especially after it received so many glowing write-ups here."
5,i thought this was great,"with reference to another review, this was my first rucker book and it made me want to read more. finally, a book about a mathematician and a proper look at the ramifications of mathematics. i think rucker must be one of the greatest authors out there today, the reading was fluid and enjoyable. i'm not much for the little sexual excursions, but it didnt seem too out of place or trashy. overall, one of the better books i've read, and i would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,The King of Cyberpunk is Throned,"I am a 13 year old fan of all mathamatics and anything that has to do with computers, so I picked up this sucker after reading the 'ware series. Never has a book taken me to a higher state of mind. This masterpiece could be considered a book in the bible.I am a huge rucker fan and I read all things he writes on paper. After Rudy took me to the world of Cimön, I feel I must go to San Jose and be taught by the new king of scifi. Step aside Orson Scott Card, goodbye heinlein, so sorry Gibson, see yah later Phil K. Dick, Rucker has taken reign of all that is cyberpunk."
1,Bright Light? This book would be dim if you burned it!,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody. It stunk. I've read several other of Rucker's books and enjoyed them immensely. This title disappointed greatly. If this was my first try at sci-fi or Rucker, it would have been my last. The best thing I can say is that I see it is out of print and not available via Amazon; may it stay that way!"
1,Pain!,This book is really really horrible. It took me a while but I finally finished it hoping it would get better.....it didn't. I was disappointed in the book after having read and enjoyed the 'ware series and Hacker and the Ants. My advice is don't bother.
1,Quantum Literature?,"In the strange worlds of quantum physics and the mathematics of infinity, things happen which defy common sense. Rucker was stuck in a small women's college teaching mathematics during the composition of this book, and his feelings of being out-of-place are mixed with the illogical mathematics he was studying, resulting in a book with a disturbingly chaotic flow.Dreamlike, surreal, psychedelic or just plain haphazard (depending on your frame of mind), this book lurches from storytelling to math to philosophy to self-analysis to physics to gutter humor to Kerouac to.... talking cockroaches, infinite hotels and a marriage on the rocks.Not a pleasant read -- one is never allowed to ""suspend disbelief"" -- and the plot twists in the book just happen, like quantum events, with no logic or internal rhythm or storytelling momentum."
1,Share minority view.,"Well, someone gave me this book for Christmas and I wish they hadn't. I just couldn't get into this book. It doesn't seem to belong to the cyberpunk genre like other readers here indicate. I felt like I was unaware of some inside joke as I plowed through this. It doesn't merit a single star."
5,What Real R&B IS!!!!!,"I am currently listening to this CD for the first time after watching his episode of TVOne's ""Unsung,"" and I must say, being more than halfway through this disc, I think it's safe to say this whole album is a banger. I haven't heard one song that I didn't like. I miss the real R&B that was kept alive by Mr.LeVert. This is a must have."
2,Not so hot,"Although I have sympathy for the loss of Mr. Levert, this cd did noting for me. Maybe I missed what all the hype was about."
3,Last Tribute,"I enjoyed the CD. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be but it is still a great CD and a wonderful tribute to a legend. Gerald, we miss you!"
4,I love the uptempo tracks,"""DJ Don't"" and ""Wanna Get Up With You"" are great fun tracks. I don't care for the rest of the track. I really don't like it when his voice sounds extra nasal. It annoys me."
5,The G Man,This CD is superb! Gerald has always made great music & this CD is no exception. Every track has kept me playing it over & over again! I would definetly recommend it to every customer that enjoy great R & B music & whom may be a huge Gerald Levert fan like I am!
5,Classic Gerald - In My songs - A Must Have,"No one like G. He fell from the right tree. From Dad and Son we have had the very best of old and new school R&B. I loved Levert from jump and from way back. I have more of his earlier music than recent, but planning to correct that. I used to club in the Bay Area in the early 90's and sometimes had to park my car in questionable areas and I used to tell my friend, if my car gets stolen, I won't be as mad as if they take my Levert cassette -- they better leave my music behind. I also used to say -- Im putting my music on and lettin' Levert tuck me in tonight. How could you not love him. He sang from his natural soul. We will always miss you G., but you left us the best of your heart and soul and will live on in us through your music."
5,Gerald Levert,I love all songs and music by this Man! I have tried to get everything of his I can. This is a good CD I like this one alot. I was heart broken when I heard that he was gone.
2,Smells cheap,"Not what I expected. I've read that ""Ungaro III"" was a rose scent for men, but it doesn't smell like rose to me.The description says it contains ""cirtus, lavender, rose, woods, and spicy notes"". I smell citrus and lavender, but no rose at all.Overall, just not a pleasant scent."
5,Ungaro,"Love the product, price and service. My wife loves it, too. Unique scent that lasts all day and night. Highly recommended."
5,Good one...,This perfume is a good one. I read it in someone's blog and bought it. Would recommend anyone to buy this product.
2,A $20 cross between Old Spice and Brut.,"It smelled like I mixed a bottle of Old Spice and a bottle of Brut.. but what can you really expect for the price? On the plus side the scent can easily last 6-8 hours.Anyways, Ungaro III is a dark variety of cologne. Armani Code is far superior dark, but is also much pricier."
3,Nice read,"A good study on White Racialism in the United States and the affects of a ""multi-racial"" society on whites.All too often non-whites flaunt their racial pride, and they have organizations to turn to. But where do whites turn? All too often the only place they can turn to are radical organizations, because the only non-racist organization for whites out there that i know of is the EAIF.org (European/American issues Forum). If anything we need more non-racist websites for whites that don't accuse whites of bigotry the second they enter the site. Not the best book in the world, but worth a glance."
3,Yet another predictable 80s compilation...,"There are 80s compilations such as this everywhere and they all seem to feature the same tracks. This one does have a few redeeming qualities some of the others do not, however. The first track, 'The Reflex' by the defining band of the 80s, Duran Duran, is the best track on the album, but the somewhat unexpected 'Talk Talk' and 'Echo Beach' are also great tracks of the synthpop movement. However, the god-awful 'Centerfold' and even worse 'Walking on Sunshine' hold it back. All in all...it's a barely more than mediocre album with predictable tracks, but all the same good for the nostalgia it will bring."
2,Disappointed,"After Time Splitters 2, I was ready for an awesome new version of the game - or at least a heck of an upgrade. Didn't happen. This version is actually much less fun to play than Time Splitters 2. There is far less of the puzzle-solving element and far more of the run-and-gun FPS element. What I liked about TS2 was the creative way they combined these. What I dislike about TSFP is the way they basically abandon the puzzle piece. Very little thinking involved. Hence, very little challenge left. Plus, worst of all, the game is much SHORTER than its predecessor. It's as if they sort of gave up in the middle and just pushed something out the door. It's that old Woody Allen line about life (paraphrasing): It's full of pain, suffering, and disappointment; and it's all over much too soon.If you haven't bought it, don't bother. Seriously."
5,One of the best books on the subject,...The writer introduces the subject from elementary to difficult subects. Partiuclarly good is the section on the integration of complex variables. The writer first introduce the concept of line integrals so the readers have a concept on that before going furhter.
4,A very good book for complex variables with many examples.,I used this textbook in my junior year of Electrical Engineering. This book carefully explains the important theorems and concepts of Engineering mathematics. It is also filled with worked out example problems that make learning all the more easier. I highly regard this book.
1,TRASH,"The other reviews must either be the work of idiots or the publisher of the book.First of all, this book has NO proofs. It doesn't even have exact definitions and formulations of theorems.It is a bloated mess - the author doesn't even manage to define what a complex number is.The only redeeming quality of this book are the frequent references to other books - the author at least now and then must feel guilty about the garbage he is writing, and so he refers you to his betters."
4,Descriptive Historical Fiction,This book is wonderful for those interested in pre-revolution France. Written from the perspective of a washed up member of the upper class. It follows his journeys through french society as he encouters those of bother upper and lower classes. It is filled with adventure and intrigue. Worthy of the time it takes to read and definitely a favorite of mine
4,VIOLENT AND RELENTLESS,"ELise Sanders is a driven, disturbed woman who survived child abuse and grew into a violent and relentless vigilante. Babs Lakey is not a polished writer, but she grabs you by the throat and there is visceral honesty to her work that is hard to ignore. Probably as much a horror genre book as a thriller or a mystery, ""Spirit Of The Straight Edge"" is strong stuff indeed and not for the faint of heart."
3,Sort of Boring,"The first thing I noticed about all of the songs on this album was that I was getting really bored during the songs...I wanted to skip to the next one.Of course, the playing and singing on the album are top notch as you would expect from these guys, but it's the songwriting that seems lacking. End of Heartache has more of an uplifting feel to it, and more melodic.This album overdoes the harmonized guitar thing...though I'm grateful for Killswitch ""bringing that back"" into the metal scene. It's just really overplayed here. So many bands do it now that it gives me a headache...though I think these guys deserve a lot of the credit for bringing that style back."
5,Absolutely amazing!!!,"Let me preface this by saying you have to be a fan of Killswitch in order to get into this CD. I wouldn't START here, I would get ""The End Of HEartache"" first. Having said that... If you are a fan of KSE You will LOVE this CD. In fact you should ALREADY HAVE IT!"
3,"More Of The Same, But Tolerable","As much as I enjoy Killswitch Engage and their works, I must say that this album is their worst. Don't get me wrong, this band still has the talent and potential that they have always had, it's just that they didn't seem to put it all to good use here. The songs tend to be formulatic and bring nothing new to the table. However, if you were a big fan of this band's earlier works, especially ""The End of Heartache"", this is definitely a listenable album. Just be glad you're listening to this and not the new Trivium or Eighteen Visions records. At least KsE stays loyal to their sound."
4,cd-kse,"Well, I was a bit hasty ordering this product. I believe there's the same cd with bonus tracks. I didn't check before placeing the order but I got the cd I ordered. Everything went smoothly. no complaints."
3,man....,"Well as for this kse album i gotta say i don't know?i mean this is more like a alternative metal cd it has way more clean vocals and i can't even call it brutal it's not as fast loud i mean it's not really bad,well i don't know but what you can expect from this album is well all i can say is it's for sure not even close to their first two albums with jesse those two were brutal and heavy as hell great metalcore with death metal influences and since end of the heartache with howard(ugh)it's not the same but end of the heartache is a great album and it is heavy,not like their first two but worth checking out.Check this out only if you want to cause it's not really worth checking still has some metalcore but i can't even stand howard's vocals in this one he barely even screams(not that he really can)but some songs are great I JUST NEED TO HEAR SOMETHING HEAVIER THAN THIS!GET THEIR FIRST ALBUM IF YOU LIKE IT HEAVY ALONG WITH ALIVE OR JUST BREATHING!"
4,"Great album, great band, just GREAT!","Album starts off with a good buildup, with the song ""As Daylight Dies"", Then just FLIES with ""This is absolution"", which is my favorite tune on the album.These guys are great musicians, and you won't be disappointed by any track on this album. Definitely a must have for any KSE fan, or any metal fan."
4,"Amazing, but more of the same!","No question that these guys are the kings of what they do, and it's hard to criticize them because now there are a million bands copying them. The record is amazing, it's KsE, the riffs are perfect, the mix of intense screaming and souring gorgeous choruses is still there, Howard Jones is sounding more and more comfortable in KsE, and the bass and drumming is perfect. But, it doesn't sound all the different from 'End of Heartache' or 'Alive and Just Breathing.' I'd liked to have seen a few more risks taken, maybe some experimenting. But, these are minor criticisms, they do what they do, and they are the best at it. If you love these guys, you'll love this record. If you didn't like them before, this record won't change your opinon!"
2,Agree with bronxlord 100%,"This album is a huge letdown. Some people call this album maturation of the band. I call it appeasing to the mainstream and regressing musically. Long gone is the intensity of Alive or Just Breathing (which was actually a metal album), which was only sporadically present on The End of Heartache. Even though the melody aspect of the band is beat to death on this album, some of it isn't half bad and that's why I give the album two stars but it's way too formulaic and repetitive and offers no variation. AOJB offered something different with every song and even with Jesse's piercing vocals and the crunching riffs, the guys still knew when and how to incorporate melody which made that album special."
3,does it get better >,"I purchased this album for about ten dollars and some change. Was it worth it ? Hell yes! Would i pay more? Well, i'd have to say no. While this album does sound good , frankly i was a little disappointed that the crew didn't expand on their style a little bit more. After the old singer left the band , i was a little hesitant to pick up the end of heartache. But i was wrong ! their new sound and the new singer seemed to mesh very well together. Too well , in fact. Now they have set a standard for themselves , as well as their fans, that is damn near impossible to overcome. They don't even seem like they tried to overcome it as much as put out an album that just sounds the same. The hooks in the songs, and the agression in the heavier parts don't seem to have that oomph! that i was looking for. Don't get me wrong, this is an okay album and i will be buying their next effort. i just hope it gets more experimental."
5,Amazing!,I absolutely love this album. I bought it about a year ago and I still listen to it quite frequently. I highly recommend buying this CD!
5,"Great Dio Cover ""Holy Diver"" Rules !!!!!!","The best song on here is the cover of Dio""s Holy Diver you should get the cd its worth it for that song. That being said you can never go wrong doing a cover of an awesome 80s metal song. Too bad new bands cant or dont play stuff like this for the most part they go for more ""Trendy"" stuff and thats too bad. Every so called metal band out today owes 80s metal bands because without 80s metal there would be nothing heavy not to mention all the best guitarist of all time came from 80s hard rock and 80s metal, Randy Rhoads,Zakk Wylde,Steve Vai,George Lynch,Eddie Vanhalen,Kerry King and even Dimebag all came from 80s metal bands. Kids now days have a lot to learn about true metal. Bring 80s style metal back and a good way to start is awesome 80s metal Covers!!!!"
1,This album is not for real KSE fans.,"I was looking forward to hearing this album but it sounds as if KSE has went emo on us. The excellent guitar is barely noticable, they went the Norma Jean route and chose disharmonic riffs instead of clear chords. The singing goes from the howling scream to an emo-ish clean singing. This album is terrible and I do not recommend it for REAL metal fans. This is an album clearly for fans of fake metal like Norma Jean and The Red Chord. This is not KSE. This is some band that used to be called KSE."
3,Super High Quality... Just Not A Huge Re-listenability for Me,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of metalcore... (I'm even a fan of Killswitch Engage to a certain extent) However, I'm not incredibly thrilled with this album. I loved their newest (self-titled) release... It played on all of the bands strengths with incredible melody, amazing energy and heart wrenching passion. This album is similar, but something is missing. The ""spark"" if you will. Don't get me wrong, the lyrics are amazing, the songs are played very well... but the hooks aren't here, the singalong choruses feel a little ""pasted on..."" I don't know, I just didn't feel the same connection to this one!"
4,Almost As Good As The End of Heartache,"Killswitch continues on their swath of melodic metalcore destruction with As Daylight Dies, and like all of their previous releases, this is a stand out album through and through. There are no weak tracks here, as every member of the band puts his full breadth into their talent. Howard Jones continues to impress as the replacement for former vocalist Jesse Leach, and has officially become the new voice for the band leaving little doubt about his effectiveness. As Daylight Dies shows the world that KSE is the quintessential metalcore band, leaving none in their sub-genre who can match their ability to interweave melody into metal. As Daylight Dies, quite simply put, should live up to the expectations of any KSE fan."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I kinda loved this band. Even after they changed to an inferior singer on the last album it still rocked me because the riffs were just so there. But going through the motions is the best I can say about a lot of this album, and most of it is a notable step down into blandness. Their last two albums were great but this one isn't even good. I find it difficult to believe Adam the guitarist is actually into anything he's playing on this album. Possibly he handed most of the songwriting duties over to the other guitarist. It's the only thing that would make sense."
4,The Yearling,"The Yearling, by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, is a touching book about a boy and his fawn. I liked this book because it was neat to see the relationship between the boy and Flag (his fawn). It showed how far Jody would go to keep his pet from out of trouble. Also, it seemed that the more problems Flag created, the stronger the bond came among them. Another reason why I liked this book is because it was fun to read about life during that time period. It was interesting to read of all they had to do, especially when it came to walking long distance. If they forgot to tell someone something, they'd have to walk all the way back just to say what they needed to say. Furthermore, when they lived by ""neighbors"", they still lived fairly far away from each other. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a great book."
5,Best book ever,"I'm 11 years old and I just finished reading the Yearling, with tears in my eyes. Sure, it's got some sad parts, and also adventure, action, and love between a yearling and a boy. This would be your favorite book if you read it. So, on a ""different"" scale of 1-5 stars, I would give it 7."
4,Great,I was in 4th grade when I started reading it and it was hard for me to understand. I had to read a few chapters then go back and re-read until I got used to the style of writing. It was a sad book but I really liked it.
4,The Yearling; a loss of innocence,"Marjone Rawlings book about pre World War II Florida,is a captivating story about a boy becoming a man. The yearling is compared to his pet deer as they both make the step to aduthood."
3,Too LONG!!!!!,"The Yearling had too much sybolism; I don't reccomend it for the literal reader, like me. It took FOREVER for the boy to get over the deer. I'm sorry but when some kid can only play with a deer while the parents work it is extremely sad. Altough I liked the mother, she wasn't sympathetic at all and I don't blame her at all."
2,This book was very BORING!!!!,"This book was so boring that it took me a long time to finishit because I disliked it so much. I thought the story's topicwas pretty boring ,too. This book had a REALLY slow beginning,but there were a couple of parts that were exciting, like whenJody and Penny went hunting for animals and Slewfoot and whenJody ran away from his family because they killed Flag. Thesewere the only positive compliments I had for this book. StevenYum, 6th grade, ASIJ."
3,"Hunting, hunting and more hunting","I started out enjoying this book about ""the olden days"" in the country, but after a while I began to be revolted by the constant descriptions of hunting. It's hard to see how most people who aren't hunters would really enjoy this book. Even if hunting was a near constant activity, reading about it, at least for me, started to wear thin about half way through the book. The ratio of hunting versus descriptions of other activities, or of nature itself, is about 3 to 4."
2,Good Book..............,This is a very good book................if you're looking for one about how American life was in the late 1800's. Otherwise it can be very dull and boring. There is very little excitemement. The deer(yearling) does not come into the book until like page 250. I had to read this for school.Let's just say that this book is not the best and not the worst.
5,Beautiful,"Sometimes you read a book and it is just words on a page, sometimes it becomes a story. And sometimes, when you're very lucky the book becomes so real you feel transported right into the pages. That was my experience here.I loved Jody and Penny's relationship, how overwhelming Penny's love is for his son, how much he wants for Jody to learn and grow. And how he watches Jody enjoying life.The Forresters were entertaining and heartbreaking at the same time. There is much to learn from the characters in this book if your heart is open.I treasured every moment I got to spend with Penny, Ora and Jody, seeing the world through their eyes."
3,The Yearling,This book would be moderately interesting if you liked repetiveness with just a little variation. I have to read this book for school and like the rest of the seventh graders think that it is a huge waste of time. The same thing happens every day-they get up go hunting and come home. Also this book uses language that many people find hard to understand. True it is appropriate to the story and I would not mind it if the book was at all interesting. I love writing and have read a good many books on the topic. They all say not to be overly descriptive as the author is here. We all know what a sunset looks like now will you please move on!!!!!!
1,"Bittersweet, but Pointless at Times",I found this book to be very slow going. The first half of the book is pointless. It sports an universal theme but the reader must be very patient to find out what that theme is. I had to read it for school and I am thinking that it is definitely a book for adults. Most kids just don't have the patience.
1,"IF YOUR UNDER 1000 YEARS OLD, THIS BOOK WILL SUCK TO YOU!!!","THIS book is the most worthless, boring, slow-reading book I have ever been forced to read. I highly disapprove of it being required High School time-waste book. DONT BUY THIS EVER SO WORTHLESS BOOK!!!"
5,Under-rated classic-a must read,A wonderful coming of age story with complex characters and universal themes. I loved it all - the end was tough to read (I was sniffling in the doctor's office!) A must read for all who appreciate historical novels and literary classics. Very well-written - it transcends time and place!
5,Allows a reader to experience life in another time.,"Want to experience the Florida under the layers of concrete and Mickey Mouse ears? Read this book. The era is just after the Civil War when Florida had no lights or electric guitars. The story is poignant and real and though not for young children, young adults and teenagers will, for the most part enjoy it. A mature reader will learn about the flora and fauna of the area without realizing it and will certainly enjoy Ms. Rawlings gift. The characters are diverse and rich and I especially enjoyed the Forresters. If you are in a great hurry, or if you want to be artifically stimulated by high speed chases or chariots taveling at warp speed, then don't pick it up. But if you have never been to Florida, and you want to see the sun sparkling on a blue green spring surrounded by giant oaks with moss swaying on an April breeze, then read THE YEARLING and just close your eyes."
3,Slow,"Too many details, and very slow. I not only have to read it but I have to understand it for school. Some parts are OK, but there is too much description of the plants and animals, and of so miniscule relevancy to the storyline."
1,Boring Alert- Use Extreme Caution,"My English teacher made us read the Yearling. Our school didn't have enough teachers who wanted to read the books, so we got stuck with books from 1963. It is the most BORING book ever! Since there were not enough copies for everyone to have, we had to read it outloud. It took us 3 months to finish all 427 Boring pages. If you do not like boring books, I definetly DO NOT recommend this book."
1,Idiotic,"This book portrays the betrayal and killing of a living creature, the deer, as some sad yet noble obligation on the part of the young boy. He kills his friend, the deer, in order to perform a bizarre, voodoo-like healing of his father who has been bitten by a rattlesnake. This not only teaches incomprehensible medical practices to young children, but teaches them to double-cross those who love and trust them as well."
1,BLAH!! BLAH!! BLAH!! BLAH!! BLAH!! BLAH!!,"I hate this book book they don't even talk right!!! it makes no sense!! i don't even like hunting, excuse me, huntin. i have to read this stupid book for school and i absouloutly hate it!! who agrees with me?????"
1,THE SINGLE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"If you ever get the chance to read The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings--DON'T. A better use of your time would be to lick your car clean. This is the absolute WORST book I have ever read. It drags on forever with unnecessary descriptions of the trees and grass; there is no discernable plot, just a lot of nonsense vignettes; and--most importantly--it is boring. I hope that by writing this Mrs. Rawlings is spinning in her grave, because that would be more interesting than this book. I would not hesitate to give this book no stars at all--but Amazon only offers a one-star option. But I don't give a single star.Not.One."
2,Not Enough Plot,"When I started reading this book I had high hopes for it but I couldn't seem to get into it. There was a lot of description and not much plot. If you have a lot of free time on your hands read this book, if not don't bother."
4,A wonderful coming of age story about nature and tragedy.,"This is a wonderful tale that is a great one to read to children. It is about a boy called Jody Baxter who lives in a backwoods Florida cabin with his parents. Jody's overwhelming desire is to own something of his own, so when he discovers an orphaned fawn one day he is delighted. This year old fawn will not only become his best friend, but it will help him learn to become a man. During the course of this heart-warming novel, Jody has witnessed both human tragedy and the violent course of nature. This is a wonderful book that shows the relation of man to nature and the curves that nature can throw at the human race."
3,"Price great and taste fine, presentation not so much.","My sardine benchmark is the Matiz product where you get really plump sardines packed three to a can with no wiggle room and the heads and tales are cut off.Here, I get four sardines with extra room (so the fish are smaller) and the tails still on and some partially dissolved organic goop on top which had me worried until I figured out it must be the lemon.I really didn't like looking at these sardines, but I was hungry and I've got ten cans of these, so I pretended to be a penguin at the zoo and wolfed them down as fast as I could. They actualy taste pretty good.Nine cans to go, and quickly."
5,Sardines were Excellent,"What can i say about sardines? Well these were good ones, lot's of fish and oil with a touch of lemon and easy to open too."
4,Good sardines,A little bony but not too bad.. not that lemony to me. Nice big sardines. Bargain priced and overall very good.
3,OK product. Not in olive oil though.,"Product information says it's in olive oil -- not so; it's soy oil, which is very different indeed (far less attractive: soy oil isn't healthy; olive oil, naturally, is). Other than that, it's very tightly packed with fish, and the fish is very firm (I've never seen such hard sardines). The taste is nothing special, not smokey as sardines usually are. Someone below says it's boneless -- the guy must be blind, 'cause it's very much with bones (as canned sardines should be). Overall, it's an OK product but not quite as good as I expected. I may or may not reorder."
2,written by a reader,"The book was all written by the previous reader, and that difficulted my reading a lot."
3,The five clocks,I ordered this book for a class I am taking. It seems to highlight the areas needed for the course. I am looking forward to finishing this book.
1,TRY ANOTHER PHONE,"TERRIBLE PHONE, REPLACED BATTERY TWICE AND IT STILL HAS TO BE CHARGED DAILY WITH MINIMUM USE. CALLED MOTOROLA FOR HELP. CANT HELP YOU, GO BACK TO THE SELLER. NEW BATTERY DIDNT HELP. SO I HAVE TO KEEP A CHARGER WITH ME ALL THE TIME.CANT RECEIVE OR CALL FROM MY OFFICE ( IN A BUILDING) WHILE OTHER PHONES WORK, LIKE NOKIA OR BLACKJACK."
1,"Poor quality, pooer service","The phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a ""dot"" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid."
3,"Cool design with some ""need to get used to"" features","I definitely like the phone for it's slender design and features. the only thing that gets me is getting used to actually using the phone. trying to make sense of call history, or to quickly access some of your items can be trying for someone who is not as tech savvy with cell phones. i enjoy the phone and it does what it supposed to do very well... make and receive calls!clear audio quality, no dropped calls so far and a HUGE screen to see things. after reading the guide and sitting down with the phone for an hour or two and re-programming it,... it's a lot more user-friendly. it's as good as any other phone for text msgs.good battery life and if looking for accessories, definitely look for a snug holster to avoid this phone from feeling loose in its case. You can also find good accessories at Radioshack."
4,Guiding analysis,"A good introduction to the mechanics, usefulness, and limitations of scansion and rhyme forms. His examples are well-chosen and illuminating.My main beef with Fussell is that I think he puts too much stress on the limitations of convention -- on how much past use of a form shackles future use. But then, I'm a young poet with a couple bones to pick, so apply salt as needed."
4,For those who love Heroes III. Actually 3.5 *,"Armageddons Blade doesn't include that much new things, but the Elemental town is funny, though it is shame that the concept of all 7th level creatures growing at 1 per week (basic) i abandoned - phoenix grows at 2 per week (4 with castle), which is too great an advantage, even though it is somewhat weaker than the other 7th level creatures. The new neutral dragons are terribly (too?) expensive, even though they are awfully strong. I wonder, if they ever will be of that much use. Anyway, if you liked Heroes III, this is an excellent way of trying new scenarios and campaigns. I miss some new spells, artifacts (there are two new relic artifacts, though) and some modified secondary skills (too many of them stinks!), though."
5,The way we remember Ernest,"Waltz Across TexasThis is the voice and the music that we danced to 40 some years ago.I think Ernest Tubb got much better with age. The music lost that twangy sound and his voice even got deeper. His friends are all good singers too, and don't hurt a thing. I grap my littlest grandchild and we just dance all over the kitchen.Howard in Montana."
4,A Learning Story,"This is a little story about Freddie the little freighter.In this delightful tale for the little ones they will learn that just because we are not as big as others, does not mean we are not important.The illustrations are very good bringing the story to life with a great storyline. Good reading for the young one."
3,OK for convenience,"The convenience certainly is true. the product can be folded into a carry case and can fit in to my wife's purse.But it isnt that great looking.the product shipping was delayed. On enquiry, the shipment seemed to be lost. The vendor reshipped it and refund the shipping charges for the inconvenience."
3,"small, but pretty","These are pretty small - I thought they would be bigger. My fault, since the size was described. These would actually be perfect for a pre-teen."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.........NO LO COMPRES,DON'T BUY IT !!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!NO LO COMPRES !!! HAY ALGUNA FORMA DE RECUPERAR MI DINERO ?
5,The Doc's view,"The MS Small Business 2007 is fantastic. I like the appearance and the MANY tools and applications that can be used to create professional presentations, work on spread sheets or just send an E-mail which also has great features.I give it 5 stars and recommend it for small business users, students and individuals."
2,Bait and Switch Software Purchase,TO; Amazonseller15@yahoo.comI emailed you last night concerning my purchase. On closer examination after checking my Amazon purchase recent I noticed that the software you sent was not what I ordered. My order was for the Small Business Full Version 2007 whereas the one you sent was a scaled down version Office Professional. I feel like I'm being scammed here. I expect you to rectify this. I did open the software and install it thinking it be the one I ordered. In spite of this due to the wrong being shipped I expect a full refund or the correct software mailed to me. MR .Monkiewicz
3,Microsoft Office Small Business 2007,"I purchased this product hoping that it would fix some of the code deficiencies of Word 2003. It seems to, but hard to tell yet. I find the new navigation system and toolbars nice looking but clumsy to navigate. The GUI is claimed to be more intuitive and I suppose that it is good for someone who has never used MS Word, but for someone who has used Word for 15+ years it offers few advantages, takes more key strokes and time, and uses more memory while offering few true advantages over its predecessor."
5,MS Office,"This software is required for school work and future employment. Since I'm already familiar with earier versions, this one is easy to use. I like the consistency of the command ribbon, tabs, and options between the parts of the suite."
3,Good Product however lots to learn hate tutuorials,"Had no problems with loading.I looked at some of the tutorial but don't normally, however this is quite different from previous version.I'm learning by error but all in all apears to be a good product.If consumer was smarter than me they would take the time to review how the program works and I'm sure they would be able to do numerous things I'm sure I know nothing aboutMicrosoft Office Small Business 2007 Medialess License Kit for System Builders - 1 pack [LICENSE ONLY]"
2,Not great value but Word and Excel are great programs,What can anybody say about software for which there is no choice but to buy? Can't do without it - had to buy it. Therefore I think the deal could be better.
4,home Office,"i have found there is a leaarning curve when upgrading from a previous addition of Office. The biggst difference is the grouping of functions, and the use of toolbars instead of drop down menus. But once you learn where funtions are located it is very intuative.The program also backwards compatable, in my case i updated from ""Office 97"" with no problem."
3,office 2007 review small business,"The product is generally good, but it has some problem that causes it to crash often. The Microsoft support people are very good about trying to help fix the problem and have continued to assist me in fixing the problem. Might be best to try a different version of the product if you don't want to deal with crashes."
2,Microsoft Office 2007 is for childeren with time on thier hands,Microsoft Office 2007 is really bad. It has lost functionality. Programs that worked simplyMicrosoft Office Small Business 2007 FULL VERSIONnow hide all the basics that we use all the time.Outlook should be renamed LookOut!Programs really are not seemless. Word and Outlook should be under one source.I hate it! My wife went back to the old version and I am thinking of doing the same.What was Bill Gates thinking??
1,Microsoft finds a way to make things more difficult....again.,"I have been using a trial version of Office 2007 and it has been nothing but difficult and frustrating. I am an advanced user of Excel and PPT, however in this version I feel like a beginner - as if I've hardly ever used Office products before. The use of the ribbon instead of the drop down menu completely changes the entire user experience and I will definitely not be buying '07. I recommend going to the MS site and downloading a free trial of '07 prior to purchasing - I really had no idea how different the interface would be and I'm glad I only have a trial version and can easily get rid of it."
4,Great Product!,"I am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru, but based on my experience with this product I am very satisfied. I love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease. I have only used it for a month now and I still have to use some of the applications yet. If you have the money and will love to have a new Office Suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day, go for it."
4,This is An OEM version,"The product works fine so far. The only thing you should know is that this is not the version you're probably used to seeing on the shelf. This is in fact an OEM product which seems to include all the features as far as I can tell. I need to explore it a little more...You won't receive the cds in that pretty white/yellow box as shown, so if you plan to get this product. Know It won't come with manuals or support. It's recommended to more technical users. I would just say that you will end up buying books and watching tutorials with the retail version any ways. There's so much to this software than you can learn from a little manual. I would advise you to think about it and get more info see if this is right for you. I wouldn't pay more than $250 for this sort of version. That's how I see it.More info can be found here; [...]"
5,All Hail Microsoft,"All the haters are just a bunch of weirdo computer geeks who complain about software, but could never write anything better themselves. They should focus on getting a date and leave Microsoft alone. This is a well thought out product and you should be happy that you purchased it. I sure am!"
3,Not happy with MS Office 2007,"I have had this MS Office 2007 for about 5 months. The Excel and Word's new task bar on top of the screen is not very helpful compare to 2003. It is, indeed, confusing to me. The Outlook somehow is slow. I had to disable the Contact Management to make it work at normal speed.I have Windows Vista on my computer."
3,Same Microsoft strory,"If it were not for needing this version of the software for my current client engagements I would NEVER buy this. Overpriced, with plenty of good options out there. And now there is 2010 coming."
3,Have had a few problems,"I have been using Office 2003 for about 5 years, and havn't had any problems, but I have had a few with this software. Once you close Outlook, you can't open it again unless you re-start the computer. I have a brand new DELL laptop with Windows 7 and DELL say's its the software. The software company says it is the computer. Great. I have also had problems sending e-mails in Outlook, they just sit in my outbox. I guess I will have to try re-loading the software to see if these problems clear-up."
2,Dumbed down and harder to use,"The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007)."
3,Not worth it,Stay with Office 2003 unless you are willing to spend a lot of time learning this new interface. The default files are not back compatible with previous versions unless you change the settings. Very difficult to find commands and you have to do a lot of work to setup your menus.I do not recommend it for the home user. Try instead the free Open Source packages.
5,SP Daylight vol. 1,"Absolutely amazing source for any info on the Southern Pacific Daylight train. Incredibly in depth on all topics relating to the Daylight trains. Full of B&W photos and reference drawings. I don't know what's in the other volumes, but this one had more than enough info for me."
1,very disappointed,"This book had no information about what to feed bearded dragons. It was not specific. Just said vegetables. Did not say what kind, how much. It had no information about the proper habitat. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was not very informative. I would appreciate a refund."
3,excellent material but kinda skinny,"The book was very helpful for an entry Bearded Dragon owner and the authors are clearly knowledgeable. The pictures are both informative and amusing, not to mention of high quality. My only fault to this book is the price tag as compared to its thickness. I expected a lot more book."
2,Short overview,This book is by no means complete. It gives a very brief overview of the animal and where it came from. It didn't really include anything about how to properly care for the dragon.
5,Love it!!!,"Very nice works great and easy clean up, stores well and chops leafy vegetables great, it is a bit awkward to use at first but you get used to it and be very careful with the blade it is very sharp"
5,Best Chopper on the Market,"I purchased my first chopper nearly 13 years ago. I had to replace it here recently because I dropped the bowl and it cracked. My whole family loves it, in fact when my son went off to college he missed it so much that I had to send him one. The chopper is great and dices so fast."
3,Quality is questionable,"I bought this for my camper, thinking it was the same as one I already own. This unit is quite small, and the quality of the handle and gearing is questionable. It seems to ""slip gears"" whenever using, and I wonder just how long it will last."
4,My thoughts on the Food Chopper,This is my second one and I like them very much. The only reason for the second purchase I find the handlesvery weak and you should not rely on them for heavy use.Richard
3,Works for some things,"It works well for celery and onions and other firm veggies. I tried it on fresh tomatoes today, though, and it didn't work well at all. I got lots of liquid, but it didn't dice the tomatoes."
4,We love this thing,"This thing is awesome for chopping up veggies, making salsa, all kinds of stuff. We like it much better than our electric one. A word of caution though - do not hold the handle on the side when spinning the handle, it will break."
5,great product,"Great and easy to use. Very handy, especially if camping on on the road. Whipped up fresh salsa in minutes, forget the store bought crap, you'll never go back! Not extremely strong, but for the price it holds up just fine!"
1,Only has two blades,"I don't recommend this model. It only has two blades, compared to the kitchen Plus 2000 which has three blades and is more efficient. I've had a Kitchen Plus 2000 for a few years and love it. I went to buy a second one and got this one, not realizing the blade difference. Oops.. my mistake. I'm returning it and getting the better product."
5,Best Chopper Ever,"I had a smart chopper years ago and my niece ""borrowed"" it and never returned it! I searched until i found another one because in my opinion there is no chopper like it. (I tried others). The price is more than reasonable and it does a fabulous job chopping anything imaginable. I use to give demonstrations to the members of my organization(s) i loved it so. They told me i should make a commercial!! LOVE IT!"
4,Cheap and works great,"Received this about 2 weeks ago. I don't plan on it lasting forever, but works great with onions, vegtables,etc. Worked great for making a Key Lime pie (the Key Lime portion only).Only complaint is the little cap that fits over the pouring spout does not fit well and falls off easily."
3,Food Processor,"We have friends that rave about this product. We saw it in use and we were impressed. The product is really a good product, but the only complaints I have are;1. The top does not securely lock and as you spin the handle the top does loosen up.2. My wife held the handle on the side and was spinning the crank on top when she heard a 'Crack' and the side of the container cracked where the handle attaches. We can still use it but not by holding the handle or it will be no good at all.3. The top of the container where you can add liquids or other items really is a good idea, but there should be a way to keep it closed. It is just placed on top and as you spin the crank it comes off. if there is something liquid inside it splashes out. A securely snaped device would be better.I give this product a 3* rating because of the ease on which it cracked."
3,Short lived item,"I purchased this from a gadget company about 2 years ago. Within a few uses of making salsa, a tooth on the cog for the chopping/stirring mechanism broke off. I limped along with it broken for awhile, but it just became too frustrating to use and I just recently threw it out. Hated to add all of this 'stuff' to the landfill. The concept is excellent, it's ease of use and portability are great. But the parts that take the most stress are not made with materials that will last over many uses. I will be looking for another salsa maker like this, but just won't be investing in this one again."
3,Disappointment,"I have loved this series, but the last 2 volumes haven't been lived up to the promise of the preceding ones. Volume 10, in particular, was disjointed and repetitive. Frankly, I think the series would have been much better if it had been compressed into 8 or 9 volumes. The multitude of side stories and plot twists are making me lose interest. Too many of the characters look alike, which makes the action and dialogue difficult to follow.I'm sure I'll finish reading the entire series, but I don't think I'll look on it as favorably as I once used to."
1,Could of been better,"I had so much hope when I installed this game, after the great reviews, and just didn't like it at all. The main character doesn't quite seem 'planted' on the ground. Walking thru objects and the low resolution just doesn't help, either.*no stars* for a rating."
1,Le Suck,"This product works perfectly if all you need is a broomstick type grip. The spring doesn't push hard enough for the legs to come all the way out. You have to push the button, legs pop half way out, then you have to pull the legs the rest of the way out. After about 1 week of use the leg snapped off and is not fixable."
1,Stay FAR FAR away,"I've been buying books from Amazon for years now, and not once have I actually written a review about one. However, this book is so terrible that I felt compelled to send out a warning to all those considering this book.The whole time I was reading it, the only thing I could think of was all of the naive programmers out there who might just be learning and not realize all of the bad practices this book is advising. Not to mention a complete misunderstanding of how Object Oriented Programming is to be used. According to Mr. Lobao, EVERYTHING derives from a game engine - a sprite, a tile, a font, etc...I can't believe a book like this ever made it to press. I also find it laughable that the foreward is written by a Microsoft MVP whose focus is in ADO.NET, and the technical reviewer specializes in data warehousing and internet solutions. Um, since this is a book about GAME programming, shouldn't someone who actually knows a bit about GAME programming actually review the thing?"
1,Disappointed!,I should have waited until there was reviews on this book before I bought it. Im trying to get the hang of multiplayer game programming in a 3D environment and the introductional text to this book sounded very promising. When I got it the book I got very disappointed when I discoved that it almost only covered 2d programming and only had one chapter on 3d and that was very basic stuff. The topic multiplayer only covered peer2peer technology and almost nothing on client-server which is more interesting when programming multiplayer for more then 4 connected players.For persons interested in 2d game programming i suppose this book could be of good value though.
1,-5 Stars!,"I would Actually give this a -5 if there were an option for this. Obviously no proofreading was done, the layout is horrible, and the author jumps into programming without much explanation of what he is doing.The examples don't work."
5,happy customer,Item arrived on time and in condition advertised (new). Would order from this seller again without hesitation. Thanks for excellent service.
4,The Centurion,This is the story of a Roman Centurion and his political and religous beliefs during the time of Jesus. The story of Christ as seen from the point-of-view of the Roman Centurion is the central theme. The Centurion is responsible for the area of Judea and reports to Pontius Pilate.He is a battle-weary soldier who has no religous beliefs but still believes in justice for all regardless of their position in society.
5,Great Refractometer,"This refractometer is much cheaper than a lot of them, but is of excellent quality. Works as well for checking the Brix of grapes as my old one, which someone stole. Very pleased with it."
1,Just a coffee table book,"This is basically just a coffee table book - plenty of nice pictures but light on substance. If you want detailed (even semi detailed) information on compact design, space saving ideas and the like than look elsewhere."
3,Taster,"I enjoyed the wide variety of projects presented. I'm a visual person, so thought there could have been more photos per home to orientate oneself with the accompanying floor plans.Overall, I return to this book (amongst others of its genre in my collection) because of the celebration of small project design.This is not for those who dislike modern, minimilistic elevations."
3,"All minimalist, nothing else","Monotonous. Even though the houses in this book are from around the world - Europe, east Asia, Australia, South America, and a sprinkling from North America - every single one is in the minimalist style, mostly boxes and a few oddly shaped things, all with little aesthetic appeal. I learned nothing about the architectural traditions of different parts of the world.The text doesn't convey much, the floor plans are hard to read and often do not show every floor so it's hard to get an overall feeling of the design, but the book has beautiful photographs and a large amount of material, 420 pages worth. So, if you like to look at pictures of minimalist houses then get this book, otherwise avoid it."
3,dont add too much water,product comes with water absorbing crystals. If you add too much water they expand to over twice the container size. never did get to see if it would grow other wise.
3,"Plants grow fine, but kind of a ripoff","Within a month or two I had counted about 60 lil catnip plants growing. But, the instructions suck. This was my first time growing anything before. I had to look up on the internet why my catnip plants started to not do so well. I learned that they were growing long and spindly from not getting enough sun. And that I was watering them wrong with too much water at a time. Plus I waited waay too long to replant and separate them.This is kind of a ripoff. What you get is around 70-80 seeds and a tiny cup of dirt. Looking on amazon, I could buy 400 catnip seeds for around $2-3, a bag of potting soil for $3 and a small pot, but larger than the cup, for a buck."
1,never bloomed,"Had great hopes for this --- however, it never bloomed. Disappointing because I wanted to give my ""babies"" something they would enjoy."
1,Not thrilled,"I bought this cat nip package and also bought cat grass kit for my 3 cats cause they love their greens but the cat nip hardly grew at all and this is not the first time ive tried to grow it for my cats, the cat grass on the other hand was awesome and cats enjoyed it definitely will buy more grass but not the cat nip. Not impressed with the product at all :("
3,Catnip Plus,I received the catnip kit. Right away I put the kit together and put it in my greenhouse. The catnip grew as the instructions said. Thank you.
1,Is This A Real Product?,"When I first saw this product, I was so excited as my cat loves catnip and is a real ""greens"" eater. I read the directions and the previous reviews, so I could avoid the usual stumbling blocks. It is now three (3) weeks later, I have perhaps 4-5 little sprouts that cannot be seen unless the container is in front of your face. I am so disappointed. What a waste of the purchase price."
1,You got me this time...,I thought I was getting plants...I can't believe I paid all this money for seeds and a tablespoon of soil and a plastic dish...lesson learned read all the way to the bottom off the description no matter how much jibberish there is in between! Even the picture looks like live plants...
1,Do Not Buy This CD!,"On two occasions I sent for this CD from Amazon and got something other than expected. Oddly, the factory has used the wrong recording for this disc. What you will get is some type of blues compilation CD with people like BB King, Ike & Tina Turner and Leadbelly on it. This is not a recording of John Lee Hooker. Amazon should withdraw this from the market immediately!"
1,what a lemon from AMAZON!!!!,"AMAZON CLEARANCE DEPT. SUCKS!! THIS ITEM WAS USED,RUSTED,BANGED,I GOT SCREW! BUYER BEWARE OF THIS DISCOUNTED DEALS.GP"
3,Blackberry Travel Charger,I think your product is ok and the various pins also come in handy. Thank you and keep it up.
2,old book,"Used Book arrived intact, but smelled like cigarette smoke. Will try to air out before reading with my son, Disappointing..."
5,TGHN,"Hi, TGHN is a great game, we all know its unrealistic, but its still fun, the graphics are extreamlly good, especially the lighting effects, the missions are easy, i have clocked hte game before, by the way, i am ranked number #1 in the world in the game, noone on the Zone could beat me, i could take on the hole server easy, carrier landing is the hardest form of landing and i could do it with my eyes shut, manually of coursem not the bull$hit ILS lol!by the way, my name in the game was Movallin!"
1,I'd give it half a star but i cant,"It's extremely unrealistic and makes enemies 1000 times weaker than they should be, not only that after a while it becomes to hard! ie Columbia mission 8. (land on an enemy airfield come on people think!) Whatever you dont buy this if you want to buy a flight sim buy Falcon 4.0 an excellent sim."
1,Can't even install it!!!!!!!!,"I Had this game for 5 years and I still can't figure out whats wrong. Whenever I Insert the CD in its drive, The drive detects a I/O error. so I can't install the software. Hasbro Should of made this easier."
4,great pup sound call,"this is a goog pup in destress call.or ki-yi call.but i like the lile dog green better to doki-yi calls on, both takes some pratice to do well!rick p."
3,No Prologue,This edition does not include Shaw's original prologue opting instead to only present his alternate version. I found this oversight to be very disappointing as it doesn't allow for a complete understanding of how Shaw wanted the play to be presented.
4,this guy is relentless.,"this movie is really good,i like a movie with clues coming together,to show the big picture.james woods maybe off the force,but he's still in the game.the movie moves at a good pace with a great ending.a real sleeper from the 80's i had never seen before."
5,cop is king,"I want a special edition dvd of this film.Its one of my favorites and it needs to be on dvd.James woods brings your average cop vs killer story to screaming life.think dirty harry if played by james woods and you will know exactly what this film is like.They show it on the bravo channel alot,my vhs is worn out,I want it on dvd!"
1,Never received!,"Ordered this rug on 5/12/07, never recieved a notification of shipment but had a estimated arrival date of 5/24/07. Sent two emails to seller, no response until days after, then nothing again, called them today, they said the order would ship on 6/18/07. No contact was made w/me to find out if this was acceptable, can't wait to see how long it takes to get my money back!"
3,Not IDM,"Even though this is on the Warp label, it is different than what I expected. It is not, by any means, IDM. OK, there are hints of clicks and other sounds to qualify as influenced by that genre, but definitely not a part of it. I would catagorize it as noise, not in the negative sense of the word, but the musical catagory. Hectic, confusing, random, and very beautiful -- if you like that sort of thing. Very creative, but again, not like other Warp releases."
4,Benzomatic Spark Lighter,Should be in everyone's emergency kit. Much safer than matches. Haven't used this one yet but have had one before and hope I won't need it to light our gas range during a power failure!
2,Doesn't Get It Done,I wanted something that could ignite the gas flame on my stove. This doesn't do it. No flints included as noted by a previous review.
3,A little disappointed.,"This lighter works okay, but I really thought I was getting the flints along with it. I was fooled by the photo."
2,I think it's alright,"yes, i got this product in time, fast delivery & i think the sellers are reliable in that matter. however, i bougth the wrong item. My computer doesn't accept 512mb sdram module, it accept two of 256 mb sdram to reach the maximum of 512mb memory Ram. so the problem is this product is not eligible for return, i think, because i ask them for return authorization and they didn't give me one. I guess i just have to save this for future use."
1,buyer beware,"Ok the product states that this memory is compatiable with mac, not! I tried to install on my G4 quicksilver and it simply did not work. I emailed the store and was accused of frying the memory. No way because the memory stick worked in my other pc. The store refused to take the memory back. In addition the memory was sent wrapped in my paper invoice. What's up with that. No static packaging. I will never buy for this store again."
3,didnt work for me,I ordered this and it didn't work... Maybe it wasnt the correct one... but i really can't rate it cuz i didnt really use it. But the company refunded my money quickly and easily so that was pretty awesome
5,ACP-EP Memory 512MB PC133 168-PIN SDRAM DIMM (MAC and PC),i bought this for my Sony Viao desktop that only 128MB ram i needed an upgrade so i got this 512MB and it works i just ordered another 512MB to give it 1GB it should be coming in the next few days
5,Above and Beyond,"I had several other memory sellers tell me which memory I needed, and Calvin N Hobs had the best price. Low and behold wrong RAM chip. They asked for the information about my computer, located the correct memory, and in short order I have the right memory, they accepted the return graciously, and I have a functioning computer.Truly Thank you! You defiantly will have my memory business from now on. DSB"
3,Good or bad?,"I have no idea how good this product is. I go the wrong Ram for my computer. THis is the ram i purchased, but it would not work for me. I got too high MB. The company's customer service was GREAT. I called them and not only did they get me the answer to my problem, the exchange the Ram for the kind I needed. Great company to do buisness with."
5,It works,"I put it in and it works well so far. No more memory problems. The shipping was quick. It worth the money. However, I am not a computer geek so i do not know if it actually is the best memory card out there but it does work."
1,you send me the wrong one,"I ask for memory for ,my lapto aple,but you send me the wrog one,the one you sen it was complet diferen from the one ,i ask for"
4,Have an old computer was happy I was able to find memory for it. Thanks,"This was just what I need for the dinosaur computer I have, thanks for having it available to order."
4,"Good,but the Mario team makes it better","I've played basketball with my friends, a lot. yet I've never played on a team. But with this game it doesnt matter. I would recommend only getting this game if your getting it for Gamecube. Why? Because of Mario Luigi and Peach. They just make the game seem more funny and less serious......just the way i like it! Also with the move stick it can become a natural way of moving in the game. The ability of chosing and customizing the character's looks and stats is just one of the many features that make this game overal A-My Opinion:Graphics- A-Sound- B+Controls- AReplay value- A-Overal Score- A-"
4,Martino in a contemplative mood,"I am a guitarist and have listened to Pat Martino's work for 20 years or so. My favorite Martino discs are Consciousness. El Hombre and most recently, Stone Blue. The Maker, however, is a very unique and quite mellow Martino record. The compositions are more then mere ""heads"" or vehicles for improvisation. Martino is more reserved than usual on this disc and it shows a side to his creative nature that's more contemplative than previously shown. If you like Pat Martino (and if you know anything about guitar I can't see how you wouldn't like him) you will like this record."
2,Messy & Impossible,"I purchased this for myself, soon after our son turned 1.First off, his hand is larger (long fingers like daddy) than the tin at 1 year and wouldn't fit. By the time I decided maybe I'd just get his fingertips, the puddy had dried. Insane. This stuff dries up SO fast it's ridiculous how parents with a 1 year old will have enough time to get their kid to stretch out their hand perfectly for a print. I'm hoping that by next year, when he's 2, we might have better luck. It is neat that it goes up to 5 years old though, so I am holding out for hope of a good print- as of now, no luck."
4,Great gift for new parents!,This is great to have -- my four year old now marvels at the fact that his hand once was so small. It's a great present but may be a better gift for parents who likes to stay on top of things. It turns out to be a waste when parents forget to do it every year.
1,Not happy!,I'll never buy this type of product again. I've used the clay type before where you just roll it out take the hand/foot print of the child and let it dry for 48 hours. Much much better than this!!! Between adding the contents and stirring - not knowing how much to add but was instructed to not add all of it - then waiting for a proper consistency with the stirring and when I finally went over to get my child's hand print it was rock solid! I have to go buy another imprint kit now! What a waste of money!!! Definitely get the clay type - so much easier - so much better!!!
2,Problematic,"It's easy to mix the plaster, but hard to tell when the right time is to have the child put their hand in. It seemed to set either too slowly or too quickly. It's quite hard getting a 1 or 2 year old to press their hand into the plaster properly, but that's not the product's failure. One thing I must stress is that you make sure to let the plaster dry completely before putting the tin lid on. I put the lid on before it was completely cured and ended up with black mold growing on the underside of the lid.All in all, I find the moldable clay kits much easier to work with, less messy, and they give you more chances for a successful print."
4,a few things I would change,"The stacking container is really cute, but it was slightly more difficult than I thought it should have been to get a decent handprint out of it. Also, maybe I didn't read the product description closely enough but the smallest size says ""1 year"" on it, and I was hoping to use it when my daughter was younger (in fact, I did use it when she was 9 months because her hand was barely big enough to fit in the ""1 year"" container at the time). I wish that instead there had been a label for the parent to write the date/age of child when the handprint was taken, instead of being prelabeled with 1 year 2 year and so on."
3,"Nice Idea, but...","I gave this as a gift. I was told that the material dried too quickly and they weren't able to get a print, due to the one year old being not too cooperative."
1,Waste of money,"I am sure that some people were successful with this, however I was massively disappointed! The directions say to tap the tin on a table to level it and then put your child's hand in... in the 30 seconds it took me to tap/level the plaster, it hardened to the point that it wasn't smooth and I couldn't put my daughter's hand in it. And the only option (since it can't be re-moistened) is to send it back to the Child to Cherish company AND pay $5 to have new plaster shipped to you, or buy new plaster. Total ripoff and waste of time/money. Very disappointed."
5,Great gift!,"I have bought these for all 5 of my great-grandchildren. Their parents are thrilled and look forward to every birthdays new hand print. It makes for permanent, special memories"
1,Why would anyone purchase a manual trickle charger?,"It may or may not have worked. However, it requires you to monitor the battery being charged, and remove it before over charging! For a few bucks more (sometimes less), you can get a trickle charger that can be left attached to the battery indefinitely (all winter) without causing damage. Just hook it up and forget it! Don't waste money on a manual trickle charger."
1,Not a Battery Tender!,"I purchased this because I thought it was a trickle charger (battery Tender), instead I find it needs to be monitored. The name is ms-leading, I returned it."
2,Careful---Not really a trickle charger,This is advertised as a trickle charger but it is really a manual charger where you have to be careful and not leave on and overcharge the battery...a trickle charger you can leave on and forget. Also the clips are very small and will not fit an automotive size battery and there is no light to indicate it is on....I have three or four trickle chargers at another home and they are all good...this one is not
4,Good charger.,"Use this to charge my tractor battery in the winter, works fine. Also was the cheapest I saw it anywhere on amazon here."
3,For Motorcycles and Lawn Tractors,I purchased the item for my car only to read on the box it is for motorcycles and lawn tractors. So don't do what I did...read the print before ordering.
2,a [???] in between two greats,"there is nothing much to say: this album has none of that groove that hot buttered soul and ..to be continued has whatsoever. it is overproduced and homogeneous. i recommend not to buy it if you expect to hear the groovy improvisations of hyperbolicsyllabicsesquadellamystic & ike's mood and the great sounds of phoenix. how can man make such an unlistenable album between two masterpieces?p.s. the two stars go for i stand accused, which intro is a bit soothing(and misleading)"
1,Comment on pricing and not content,"I just learned of this album and zipped over to Amazon to buy it. I saw that I would be paying $9.50 for four songs. I don't care if two songs are over ten minutes long this is utterly ridiculous. Sale lost, I don't want this product *that* much."
5,Vanilla tastes great,"The vanilla tastes great and is creamy when mixed. The Carb count is very low. My only complaint is that is doesn't mix (shake) easily and is clumpy, but getting past that it is perfect."
5,The Best Academic Tool I've Seen Yet,"This product is simply amazing. From the 3D Tours, to an incredible Atlas, to the dictionary and foreign language translator, you can't beat it!"
3,Love the content but it locks up constantly!!!!,I have been a Microsoft Encarta users for years now. Always buying the upadtes every year. For some strange reason Encarta locks after I look up 1 or more pieces of information.I love the program but I have to restart it every minute or so. Very annoying!Other friends of mine complain about it being very slow on their system.Maybe I have an isolated problem on my machine. I hve the latest software updates and a very new Sony laptop. I cant figure out what is wrong.I say buy it and try it yourslef on your machine. If it locks up take it back and consider another company. Dont go through years of hoping Microsft will getting around to getting rid of the bugs in it.
2,Waldo in same location every page,I love Waldo and all but in this book he is located in the same position on almost every page. There are so many wonderful spots they could hide him but they end up putting him in either the bottom left or right side of the page almost every time. The kids got thru the book very fast and they were disappointed with him being in the same place all the time. There are definitely not enough pages either.
5,Waldo books,Loved these as a techer years ago! I bought them for my granddaughter and she loved them yoo!
3,Wally,"Wally books are great fun but the mini ones are a bit too mini and make it difficult to see the pictures, so all our children lost interest pretty quickly."
2,did not meet my expectations,It will meet the needs of some but I tried it for a strenuous field activity that requires plug in and unplug allot. It did not work for me. A full time connection it wold prolly do ok.
1,Big Disappointment,"I have used an older edition for some years and just loved it. Thought it would be good to upgrade with my new XP operating system.I paid for this program at least twice with all the tech calls I made trying to get it to stop crashing not just the program but more seriously the system as well. After my 5th call to Oregon, and an hour or more on the phone, still crashs the system. It is now toast as far as I am concerned. Reinstalled my old program and it works fine. Keep your money."
1,Cannot print!,"I found this program easy to use to create my documents, especially to incorporate digital pictures, but have difficulty printing. The file sizes are huge and the program itself takes up a lot of memory. I have tried printing at kinkos and several other printshops, all unsuccessfully. I will go back to microsoft publisher."
1,Buggy and Frustrating,"I feel lucky if I can run the program for 15 minutes without it locking up on my XP machine. I bought it for the feature of being able to do things like a newsletter, and save it as a webpage, which works slick. But, the program hangs a lot, runs slow, and behaves strangely. One example, I added a 2nd page to my newsletter project, but it would not allow me to add anything (not even a text box) to the 2nd page. Not worth the money at all."
1,Out-of-box experience is thumbs down,"Installed OK on XP/Home and have tried every conceivable way to simply open a JPG file on a LAN based server. Twenty minutes later, all I see is the hour-glass cursor -- not even a file dialog box.This product is going back to the store."
1,Very irritating software!,"First used on Win 98 . . . locked up constantly, then tried XP, runs agonizingly slow. The ""Help"" is not so helpful, basically it is a terrible package. Wish I had checked the reviews first."
3,Opera : a well made Argento but not his best,"Opera is worth seeing for horror fans, in my opinion, if only for the amazing scene where the bullet comes through the door and hits her in the eye. That scene alone is worth the rental if you are a gore fanatic.Other than that this movie is overall very well made, like most of Argento's giallos, but its flaws lie in the storyline being too one dimensional, in my opinion. It's a feast for the eyes."
4,Very Very Good movie,"This film is A VERY good one..it has mystery,horror,style good acting. The crows annoyed me to bits but that was part and parcel of what made the film so creapy. The camera work is second to none and i believe is ahead of it's time;how they found the killer is beyond me but even that was a good stroke. The lead actress was a bit over the top with the noise she made and she to me failed to cut it as the opera singer type and she looked stilted while performng the opera scenes but she was nice in her role.Filled with twists and turns it's ending rivals any i've seen for drama .This is highly recommended by me..highly.The score is just awesome."
2,Just not my cup of tea.,I guess im more picky then most of you guys out there when it comes to Argento's work. I like his movie Suspiria and probably not much else.
1,DID NOT WORK IN DVD PLAYERS,i tried to watch this DVD in both my DVD-Rom & DVD player & it didnt work. i exchanged it & that copy was messed up too! the dvd is gold & looks like a burnt copy! BEWARE!
2,pretentious and pompous,"Maybe I am just getting tired of Argento' work but every other his movie I watch seems worse and worse. Yes, as with other Argento movies a cynematography is unusual, but when this doesn't accompany anything else you start to question the meaning of this creativity. The plot is absurd, acting is horrible (the actress playing the main character is the worst), suspense is minimal. Even gore, that I personally don't care much about but which should be there according to the genre, is totally unimpressive. Plus, it's plainly boring."
2,Sub-par Argento,"Thus far the worst Dario Argento film I've seen, Terror at the Opera concerns a female opera singer who falls prey to a mysterious stalker. (It's not as much like The Phantom of the Opera as it sounds.) It contains Argento's trademarked style and atmosphere, but it fails to improve the storyline and it especially doesn't make up for the terribly lame ending scene. END"
3,"Weak from Argento, weak in general","Here is my rating for Opera:acting=1 stareffects=4 starsending=1 staratmosphere=4 starsDirecting and Editing=3 starsstoryline=2 starsreplay value=2 starsAs you can see, it's a big disappointment. While the atmosphere is quite good, the acting, the dialogues and the ending ruins the whole movie. This is the silliest ending for a horror-film I've ever seen.Sorry Argento."
4,seductive Salome has a deadly dance,"I found this book to a very quick and interesting read. Salome is both loved and feared by men. She uses her deadly seductive power to get anything she wants, almost.The price of the book is so cheap how can you resist not buying it."
2,another re-recording of your favourite hits,This CD isn't quite as bad as most you find with re-recorded hits. Even some 10 to 15 years after he was at his most popular Tommy still had a good enough voice to do a reasonable job of re-recording his big hits. But for those music fans amongst you who are after the original hits don't go for this one.
4,Nice Read!,"Ok, I really liked this story. It had mystery, passion, and a love out of this world. Trajan and Maya are crazy together. In the beginning, I was wondering how these two people are going to fall in love with each other! I for one personally liked Trajan's name. But I must say at times during the novel it was hard to follow. But overall it was an enjoyable read!"
3,The Business,"Maya Woodson was trying to find out who killed an elderly woman who lived in the hotel she owned. Never in a million years did she think finding the woman's killer would reveal the truth about her own father's death. Maya worked with her father's partner in getting the company to go public. Along with that she had to work with the handsome Trajan Matthews. Maya despised this man.Trajan came up poor. His mother loved him, but all she had for him was love. Trajan decided he would make something of himself and leave the neighborhood he grew up in and never look back. He was a successful investor relations expert. He thought he had everything he needed until he met Maya.After the inital denial of being attracted to her, he gave into his feelings. I think this book could have been longer. It seems something was kind of missing. I did like George the police officer who grew up with Trajan in the old neighborhood."
4,Short but Good,"This story about Maya and Trajan was pretty good, although it could have been longer. Maya took over her fathers hotel business after he has died. Maya and her partner (her father's best friend) decided to take the hotel investment public. This is when she meets Trajan. I will not say it was love at first sight but there were sparks.Trying to find out who murdered her friend in her hotel suite reveals some hidden issues of not only the murder victim and her family but also Maya's family.There were some unanswered questions with this book. I think that if the book was longer Trajan's past could of been explored deeper."
1,"Brilliant music, recording quality is MINUS 5 STARS","The music on this CD is wonderful and these musicians are in incredibly fine form. Unfortunately, the equalization on the recording is so distorted that it is painful to listen to this CD. For overall audio quality -- listenability -- this is probably the worst CD I have ever purchased (of hundreds) from Amazon.com and it is a bad joke that it cost the import price of $28. Sad. This could have been an incredibly enjoyable CD if the mis-equalized bass did not make your sinuses hurt."
4,Good Yarn,"I don't usually read police detective books, but I decided to read this one because its setting was in a town that I used to live in. The author must have lived there too, because every place, street, etc. was real. The story was fast moving and hard to put down; I was always wanting to find out what was happening next. One complaint was that it was too short. Hope he writes a sequel."
1,I have been unable to return the product,I ran into some serious problems installing the product and setting up the raid array. I have been trying to return the product but am STILL waiting for the return lable.At this point I am very unhappy not only with the product but with dealing with Amazon itself.
3,"Not Very Good, But Not Horrible Either","Definitely one of my least favorite Poirot books. As other reviewers have mentioned, the solution to this mystery is quite apparent about halfway through the novel. I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution. The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here; all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages. Having said all of that, it does make for a quick read that does not require much thinking. If you are looking for a great example of a murder-in-retrospect book by Christie, I would recommend ""Five Little Pigs"" instead."
3,Enjoyable Mystery - No elephants Involved.,"This mystery novel with 'Elephants' in its title uses the word elephant metaphorically to identify humans with long memories. The protagonist, Ariadne Oliver, with help from investigator Hercule Poirot, contacts such 'elephants' to find the answers to a twelve year old double suicide or murder-suicide; that being the mystery.Story has nothing to do with real elephants and no elephant ever appears in it. Enjoyable typical of Christie stories I think."
2,Predictable,"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie, but this mystery was lacking. I figured out whodunnit about halfway through the novel, but thought to myself, ""No...it can't be so-and-so! That would be too obvious."" Well, guess what. It was. It was still a good read because I enjoy Ms. Christie's writing style and interactions between characters. If the mystery itself is not the only important part, then it's a worthwhile book."
1,Even Agatha Christie can run out of convincing plots.,"Inspite of a good character analysis and settings, this book falls much much below the usual standard of A.C. The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"
5,Unexpected :),"I've read almost all of Agatha Christie's books and this one is a masterpiece, in my opinion. The plot is good, the conclusion is wonderful and she has a way of dealing with the people's personalities that just makes you get in their minds and actually share their emotions. It's nice, I loved the book."
5,AWESOME,I loved this book! I love horror and mystery books and I'm so glad I found Agatha Christie. I cant wait to read even more Agatha Christie books.
3,Tediously disappointing,"I found this late Agatha Christie novel disappointing compared to most of her earlier works. The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past. Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved. There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people, hashes things out in her mind, then tells Poirot what she was told, then he hashes things in his own mind, then he tells others, ... Uh! The same ""fact"" or ""theory"" is repeated in many places, to the point of insulting the reader's intelligence. This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose. Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory. Overall I give it 2.5 stars."
3,For the Die-Hard Christie/Poirot Fan***PARTIAL SPOILER***,"It is quite obvious, early on in this book, that the author was advanced in years. The math is off, so badly, and so often, whenever the subject of years comes up: how many years ago did it happen? How old is so-and-so now? etc. Also, the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot, pretty much; Ariadne Oliver, though only supposedly middle-aged here, is more muddled than most eighty-year-olds I know. Even the victims' ages: 60 and 35? Pretty unusual, that. If the wife/victim were only 35, why was she so worried about her advancing age?So, if the reader can get past all the muddle, it is still an entertaining read, IF, as I say, the reader is a die-hard fan. I am, so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: Christie's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get. She really hearkens back to very early Christie, in her inability to understand, much less handle, romantic love in any sort of realistic manner."
1,My least favorite Poirot Novel ***SPOILER ALERT***,"I am a die hard fan of Agatha Christie, especially Poirot. Even to me this novel was boring and dragging. There is very little story. The plot doesn't have the juice enough to sustain a novel. It could have done well as a short story.With the dog biting the mistress, I was able to guess the ending. I have never correctly guessed ever before when it came to Christie novels.At some point, the book felt more like a psychology book, only the contents may not be correct psychologically. I wish I hadn't started this book in the first place. There are a lot of repetitive events in the books which is really tiresome. Anyway, I wish a better experience to anyone who wants to read this book."
1,Skip this one,"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense. There was not enough material for a novel in this story. Poor Poirot! Poor reader. Skip this one."
2,"Okay, I guess","This book was one of the worst Agatha Christie books I've ever read. Usually I love Hercule Poirot mysteries; they are fascinating. But I found this novel unbelievably repetitive and the end wasn't much of a climax. It beats other most other author's work, though!"
3,50/50,"Well,first of all I'd just like to start off by saying that Ms.Christie was not a charlatan writer.Her gift for writing was innate and affluent.( as illuminated in some of her better books).'Elephants Can Remember'is not a very rich novel and will certainly not make you bang your head against the wall.The ending is disappointing and the plot is somewhat infertile.As said by one of the reviewers,the climax is flat.I was not completely thrilled ,however,for Agatha Christie starters,give it a go!"
3,Its Christie so its good,Not her best work but an enjoyable read-I'm not an Ariadne Oliver fan so maybe thats why I didn't love it
3,The Conure: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet,"The book was rather vague. It is helpful, but it doesn't really give enough information on Conures. If you are looking for detailed information, this is probably not the book for you."
3,dubbing,"Well I was very happy when I saw amazon bring this to the unbox page. I bought the first episode. The animation was on que, but that's where the good part of this stops. The Dubbing (audio track) was not synced up correctly. It was a bit embarassing when I went to show a friend of mine about Eureka 7, and the flaps nor action sequences matched the screen. And I do remember when it first aired on Adult Swim, the fact that they matched up. In a way I'd like to be offered by amazon a chance to only re-download the corrected synced copy since I had already purchased my copy from them. Outside of this I'm happy with the product."
2,Scattered,I read a lot and I thought that this book might be a great addition to my collection however this book was so scattered. As much as the information was something I wanted to know I am not sure if I lost something because of unorganized layout. The book just seemed all over the place. Would I buy it again possibly but for less than what I paid. Welllll if I saw this book on the shelf and opened it up I would probably leave it there unless it was $1. That does not go to say that the stuff inside isn't worth more because it was still awesome information.
5,Novel,"awesome read - I read this book as a reference, to another book that i'm reading - again it's an awesome read"
3,A 2-Video Combination,"This DVD is similar to the two Sabrina video tapes, ""Salem's World"" and ""Sabrina in Love"". I have already seen all four of the episodes on the TV show. In the Salem's World half, ""You Said A Mouse-ful"" and ""Tail of Two Kitties"" are so funny that I liked those two episodes more. The Sabrina in Love half, with the episodes ""Key to My Heart"" and ""What becomes of the Broken Hearted?"", however are kind of heart-rendering and somewhat dramatic they had me on the edge of my seat. ""Sabrina's World"" also includes a trivia game based on those episodes. This is a pretty good DVD, but not quite recommended."
4,A less famous Aretha!,"Shirley Brown can sing! I had never heard of her, but thought I would give her a try, since I really like 70's soul music, and I was definitely NOT disappointed. Ms. Brown sounds like a souped-up Aretha Franklin. If anything, her vocal sound is a bit cleaner and more ""bel canto"" than the great Aretha. Granted, the songs on this album can't compare to the Motown classics in the Franklin songbook, but this album is really nice."
4,(SIGNED)The Dark Dragon,"Hi I am a big fan of Resident evil I have Played and beat all there games, I have not played this great game yet but I am anxuse to play it.I have some friends that played this game and said that it is great and worth buying the effects and gameplay is awsome,I am also wait to try there new Online mode That well be cool so any ways Buy this game I know you would like it I know I would I am going to buy this great game soon!!!So Good Lck on the game: PEACE OUT"
1,the worst resident evil game,"This game is the worst resident evil game yet.I bought this game thinking it would be like all the rest but instead found that it was a horrible spin off.It has bad controls and even worse game play,it makes no sense ,so save your time and money and don't bother with this game ,enough said."
4,Nice game,"Nice game but did not work on the PlayStation 3 system pal so I've played on the ps2this game region NTSC :(I received the game quickly ,Thank you"
1,i am very disappointed so far...,"by the terrible new controls of the game. why change up the controls from a hugely successful franchise? stupid. the camera angles are the worst i've seen in a resident evil game; who knows where the enemies are?!?i must state that i am a huge RE fan, but i could not be any less interested in playing online games (especially with the ps2). i think the single-player campaign in this game was glossed over in a rush because capcom was focused on putting out a RE online game. what a mistake.RE4 looks like it will be cool for the Cube, but who knows? hopefully Outbreak doesn't sell well and capcom goes back to the basics which everyone has loved for over a decade now.quit screwing up RE, capcom!!! the graphics should be better with each release, but don't monkey around with the controls. a successful franchise is successful for a reason, and doesn't need to be overhauled each time a new game comes out."
2,Capcom is really upsetting me,"Dear Capcom, you are really getting on my nerves. I am really upset with you about RE Outbreak and RE Dead aim. I think you are just getting lazy. I loved resident evil 2, 3, and code veronica, but the latest RE releases have been greatly disapointing. This game has too many problems (ie: download times, no saving options, frustrating problems, and bad characters). Don't buy it, rent it first and then decide. I am not buying any more games produced by Capcom until they realease Resident Evil 4 for the Playstation2 as well as the Gamecube. For those of you who don't know, Capcom has announced that it will only be realeasing RE 4 for the GameCube and not the PS2 because of a contact they have with Nintendo. It is just plain wrong. I'm not buying a gamecube just for one game."
1,Horrible,"This game is horrible, havent had a chance to play the network games but the scenario games are horrible, don't waste your money buying this game."
1,The worst of the Resident Evil games if not the worst game EVER,"I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and out of the games I have played this is the worst. I have to say that the characters are stupid, obnoxious, and terribly crated. But on the plus side the graphics are fantastic and not very glitchy The only decent character is Koko. This is the worst game in my 100 games that I have."
1,This game sucks,"This is possibly the worst game I've ever played bsides State of Emergency. Don't listen to the good reviews. This game is horrible and totally betrays the RE games. I wouldn't even recommend buying it, it's horrible. I've only gotten it to the second scenario and i'm already thinking of returning it. If you've never played an RE game but want to go and buy the first and second one and the third. This game is totally dissapointing. I do not recommend it save your money for Silent Hill 4."
2,WHY CAPCOM WHY?!?!?!,"Ok I might not be the biggest re fan out there but i do have the need for some fantastic gaming experiences. First off on a good note it is a beautiful game with realistic cut scenes and great effects, But the downsides pull the whole game down. There are no storylines no explainations nor much backgrounds on the character at all. Then they kill re2's adventure into the umbrella corps labs. When you start each senario they give you no reason why your there, or why you are with your AI (Which they hardly do anything at all!). The senario's are boring and dull as you run around trying to find way to excape from whereever you are. I bet most of you people out there will be beating up on my review but just remember this capcom is falling and there taking resident evil with it!"
2,Not for a Resident Evil Series fan,"This game is weird and is nothing like Resident Evil 0,1,2,3. I hated two of the games Capcom made in the series, one of them was Resident Evil Survivor, the other is Dead Aim. This game is better than them but its just weird and time consuming and not scary, just frustrating. I am glad i rented it and didnt buy it. If you like Dead Aim it might be good for you and online gaming is fun but i am looking forward to Resident Evil 4 on gamecube. This game gave me headaches, but it has a different taste, its unique gameplay with great graphics but not for me. Online players might like it."
1,Horrible,"I have been a big fan of the Resident Evil games since the beginning. This is by far the worst RE game to date. The other characters that you interact with are extremely annoying. They constantly repeat the same few words over and over again. They also seem to die rather quickly, even against weak enemies like the zombies. Moving from room to room will also make you angry. You can take a nap in the amount of time from when you open the door to a room and actually step in it. Maybe it's just me, but the controls seem to have become worse too. The kick and tackle commands are next to useless, and most of the camera angles just plain suck. I am very disappointed with this game. Horrible job on this one Capcom. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
2,Capcom is really getting on my nerves,"Dear Capcom, you are really getting on my nerves. I am not buying any more games produced by Capcom until they realease Resident Evil 4 for the Playstation2 as well as the Gamecube. For those of you who don't know, Capcom has announced that it will only be realeasing RE 4 for the GameCube and not the PS2 because of a contact they have with Nintendo. It is just plain wrong. As for this game dear Capcom, I am really upset with you about RE Outbreak and RE Dead aim. I think you are just getting lazy. I loved resident evil 2, 3, and code veronica, but the latest RE releases have been greatly disapointing. This game has to many problems to list. Don't buy it, rent it first and then decide."
2,Not a serious Resident Evil game.,"Not much to say here, it's like analyzing a football game when the score is 50 to 0. The game has terrible controls(worse than before), laughable load times and it's boring. It's not scary at all, I'm serious. It also has no definate characters to really build a story on. It just doesn't have that tense feeling of serious Resident Evil's past. Even if you're a fan and just think anything with Zombies is cool, you will change you're mind. RE has always been about cool. This games characters and their constantly cheesy out of place lines get very annoying. Imagine a person climbing a latter and then in the midde of the act just screaming out "" I don't know what to do!"" even as they keep climbing. If you're like me you expected much more from this one. Just wait till RE4, it better be beyond good."
5,"Re, outbreak","Awsome game loading time is anoying, all you need to do is get the hdd module for the ps2 and the loading time is cut down alot.Im not 2 sure of the price on one, you can buy a ps2 with one in it for like $160, comes with final fantasy 11 online **cough"""" rip off """"cough""... any how resident evil outbreak is cool. Lots of character just incase you dont like one for some reason. Its a long game, bosses are cool, cut sceens are cool... just buy it from amazon, retain cost right now is about $60-70-80 OUCH!"
4,BEST RESEVIL YET,"Man, this game is spooky. Featuring a revolutionary feature where you can play through story mode with 3 other humans online, this is by far the BEST resident evil game yet. as always, umbrella is putting racoon city under a quarantine and you gotta get the heck out! shoot your way through darkness, zombies, monsters, and all kinds of nasty creatures that'll make any gamer's stomach turn. and, for the first time, watch your character turn into a zombie when you die! i highly reccomend this smash hit. great job, capcom!!"
1,WTF!,"This was the worst game I ever played. I coudn't even get pass the first part. There's no storyline and I had time to fix a grilled cheese sandwhich in between rooms. Thats how long the load times were! You run around tryin to save yourself from zombies when the real zombies are right behind you! This mindless group of people running around supposedly trying to help you. All they really do is get in the way and run off without you. Lets not even get started on the repeated ""have you found anything yet?"" This game was not worth $50 bucks. I took it back the next day and got a full refund."
3,Question,"Just a question, everyone. Can you play with 1-4 players offline, using only the game & a (multitap, etc.), and NOT be online in Outbreak 1 & 2?"
3,too short and the online is dead,"Capcom has taken down the servers so all your left with is an average resident evil game with a short single player. If you don't have the ps2 hdd then this game is one long single player with alot of loading screens whcih can take more then ten seconds, thats not counting all the times you'll open doors and backtrack to previous areas, load game speaking of loading game this game has the worst saving system out of all the RE game you can't save your game turn off your console and load game just normally you have to leave the game on and load from the main menu.In the end your getting half a game since the online portion is gone and that's where most of the enjoyment comes from its a shame."
2,Amazing Graphics! terrible game!,The graphics of out break were with out doubt quite possibly the best ps2 has ever seen. But you cant change camera angles you cant move quickly all in all the game sucks! it's like watching a bad movie. i loved the resident evil games! but this one seems like they spent way too much time beefing it up and for got that keeping it simple is always best!Sorry 2 stars.
1,how resident evil out break disapponited me,very bad game i am very disapointed very! i rented this game. in the beginging it was ok then it got bad. there are these gay people following you every where they make these stupied coments about how scared they are and they die like every minute. and they keep making the same stupied comments. VERY BAD GAME!!!!! don't try it! it is stupied! try resident evil 2 alot better game! the reason why i rated this game 1 star because it is bad and please don't buy it because it is a bad bad bad bad bad game!!!! this the truth about this game so don't try it at all ok
2,Worst Resident Evil Yet!,"Ok, 5 scenarios and thats it! Prepare for a game that provides no overall theme or story! And its all over after 5 scenarios! Wouldnt waste my money buying!"
1,A terrible game,"Man, I'm glad I rented instead of buying. This game is unbelievably bad. The reasons are way too many to list. I just wanted to contribute some bad feedback to a game that truly does not deserve to be called Resident Evil. If you thought the movie was great, you're probably mindless enough to like this game. If not, stay away."
5,This Game Is Awesome,"I really enjoy this game, the multiple scenarios, the replay value, and the challenges are what make this game so good. The control scheme has been slightly modified but it's improved, each character has his/her own unique moves and abilities. Every survival horros fan should play this game."
5,Resident Evil outbreak is awsome,Resident Evil outbreak is hard and its really challenging.The story is awsome i like the gore it almost looks real the creather are original with some old monsters as well the graphics are hood but not as good as resident Evil for Game cube. The levels get harder as you go along. The caracters almost look real. The playing online is the best way to play it's the greatest game i ever played.It is confusing at the start but you get used to it.
3,"It's good, but not as good as the other RE games.","This game is really fun once you get the hang of it and get used to all the bugs and glitches in the game. In certain parts its really sweet and really scary, but in others its difficult and annoying to figure it out.Positives:)- great weapons to kill zombies with (nail guns, shotguns, toilet brushes etc.)- you get a bunch of computer partners (so they can get killed while you safely take cover)- Every character has a useful talent to help make the game easier to beatNegatives:(- REALLY bad voice overs (your character will say a phrase but a completely different phrase will appear on the screen)- Your infected percent goes up even when you haven't been bit by a zombie- You can't pause the game. So say you had to like go and take a piss while you were playing, you'd most likely be dead by the time you came back from the bathroomOverall though, it's a pretty sweet game. I definetly recommend buying it, but ONLY if it's not over $20.00"
2,NnyCW for Capcom City,"An online Resident Evil game? Sounds great! However, slow load times, and a lack of keyboard or voice support really bring it down. While this had the chance to be a stellar game, it's basically just something for the more hardcore Resident Evil fans rather than just someone with a passing interest in the series. Granted, the load times can be improved if you have the game installed on your PS2 HDD, but not many people have them seeing as only three games out of all the PS2 games ever released in America use them and the new redesigned PS2 doesn't even have a slot for the HDD to fit in. So, if you're a Resident Evil fan, and have the network adaptor for your PS2, you should check the game out. (and if that's you, you probably already have the game anyway) If not, you could probably pass this one up. NnyCW for CapCity."
2,irritating!,"this game has very good graphics and ok controls, but overall a very tedious game. you can carry only very limited amount of items. the saving system is very weird (nutjobs must have thought of this saving system). you also need to complete the level (or scenario) within the time limit. if you die, you have to start from the very beginning. not fun at all! by the way, this is NOT a scary game, just annoying!"
4,"The ""Godfather"" of all survival/horror games","If you like plot twists, turns, and complete confusion... get ready for the time of your life. Resident Evil Outbreak File 1 offers events spanning from Resident Evil all the way to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis! Prepare for backtracking, battling the undead and various t-virus monsters, and a very time consuming game. All the fun of a zombie movie with the added excitement of making your own decisions.If you do not have an IQ of 10,000,000,000,000 I reccomend using a level walkthrough to help you get through the game. There are lots of secret passages, pattens, codes, and backtracking to keep you busy for a whole weekend.Online is great if you have Broadband or Cable.-> Level walkthroughs can be found on GameFaqs.com and anywhere else on the internet."
2,UPSET,"I bought this game after reading the comments of the other versions of Resident Evil, the first level in the bar and in the buildings it's easy, but when you arrive to the ""Below Zero"" level, it's difficult to find out what to do. The movement of the characters is slow, clumsy, the A.I. it's a joke, bad comments and the loading process from room to room takes a lot of time. Good graphics for a bad game. Why?"
4,Hexagon Sun,"Outside of the music, which by the way is great (except for the last track, Zoetrope, which makes the rating fall a notch down to four stars), the artwork is very nice. It was done by that mysterious ""art group"" called Hexagon Sun, somewhere in the hinterlands of Scotland. Each boxed picture could indeed fit into a film frame sequence, reminiscent from the those children and nature films done by The National Film Board of Canada in the 1970s--which have inspired this band's name. One last note, the vocodered vocals on ""In a Beautiful Place in the Country"" are great!--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001."
5,Wow!!!,"Having sampled this through listen samples only and being encouraged to order this album by positive reviews by others, I went ahead and ordered this CD. Let's just say it's smooth, jazzy, jungley, spacey, so many other juicy happy beats I could think of but won't take up the whole page to list. It's really fun with feel good beats. I love an album that you can put on and let it repeat a few times from start to finish and you don't mind....... it's that good."
4,That's how it should be.,"This listen was very nice, and extremely easy to follow. Personally, I wish for all IDM to be this simple as far as choice is concerned. I don't know about you, but I spend hours on this site listening to IDM trying desperately to find something that isn't too caustic, but still sharp enough to keep my curiosity piqued. Understand? There aren't many songs on this album, but the content more than makes up for it and the price is completely on point, too.I gave this album a 4 because it has everything I look for in IDM."
3,Insubstantial,"Evocative? ...yes. Dream-like and ethereal in places? ...yes, that too. But that's where it ends for the four tracks on this EP. Boards Of Canada have forsaken much of the rhythmic detail and sonic layering used to such great effect on the ""Music Has The Right To Children"" album, delivering a much more sparse landscape that is frustrating for those who value substance and development. These tunes all sound a bit too repetitive and self-obsessed to really stand out from all the ambient techno releases."
5,soundtrack for yesterday's future,"I ""discovered"" a scratched-up and worn copy of BOC's ""Music Has The..."" on my desk at work one day about 18 months ago. I asked around and nobody in my office of 25 claimed it. The odd cover art of circa 70's-styled children with no faces was sinister and yet inviting. So - I dropped the CD in my computer and my musical world has never been the same since...The sheer mystery, beauty, and artistry of MHTRTC has inspired my enjoyment of music to a very profound level. I never would have thought that electronic-based music could be so warm, evocative and moving. This is art.""In a Beautiful Place"" continues on where MHTRTC left-off. It's not a new direction or attempt but an extension. If you liked ""Music.."" you should like this (although some reviewers here think otherwise!).BOC's music is what I imagine the science fiction film makers of the 60's/70's/and 80's tried to create in their contrived attempts to put ""futuristic"" music behind their film and tv projects..."
2,blehhhh,What happened? Don't tell me this is group is another one-disc-wonder!! This is sparse and sonic but that's about it. I didn't see anything special in it. Perhaps the others here are hearing something I am not? How bland! What a let-down from Music Has the Right to Children!
5,Life is too short...and so is this album,"Pound for pound, this may be some of the best music BOC has ever made. Unfortunately, because of it's brevity, it will always stand in the shadows of their LPs, Music has the Right to Children and Geogaddi. Still, a brilliant work and a must have for any fan of electronic music."
5,"sure it's more of the same as before, but just as good","yes, it sounds a lot like ""music..."". no, it doesn't have as much going on or as many interesting breaks or transitions. i happen to like the minimalism of this one. it may sound too monotonous for some, but that may be more a problem of short attention/interest span on the listener's part. and, sure it may sound a bit pretty and not ""weird"" enough compared to what some others, such as Autechre and all those laptop blokes, are belching out. but, what BoC does, they do beautifully. listen to track #2 a few times (and i mean REALLY listen) and you'll see what i mean. unlike some of the more experimental acts in current electronic music, they still put musicality above ""process""."
2,mactop of lapintosh,"this is a funny sounding thing, with all the noisy crackling and unquantized parts. probably it'll remind you of, say, flying lotus, or any of the new breed of laptopper... hehe...,... laptoppers, can I trade mark this?"
3,A cool Dvd,"This was actually a requested gift, but I am told it is a cool and enjoyable movie to watch.Packaging was not good though, the dvd was loose in the cover."
5,The Best Ever Jack Jones CD,"I love the songs of Jack Jones. He is one of the most rarely recognized singers in pop ever. Where is his Grammy?This has got to have the most inspired vocals of Jack Jones. Oh, yes, there are songs that Jack sings on other collections that will blow you away among some other 'nice' vocals. On this collection, however, it is impossible to choose a favorite -- it is that brilliantly produced. The arrangements are gorgeous but they never overpower Jack's vocals.So, if you love the vocals of Jack Jones and you enjoy the songs of Michel Legrand, I guarantee you are going to play this one a lot!I only hope that those of you, who enjoy Jack Jones, are able to get a copy before it disappears from your grasp. Enjoy!!!!"
4,Helped me through difficult times,"I bought this book shortly after I was sexually assaulted by a stranger last year. It has helped me greatly and also my new partner who did not know me at the time of the attack as he was able to read all the sections for 'the significant other'.It provides good, hands on advice on how to take control of your life again. I suffered from terrible depression after the attack and this book provided lots of tips on how to get through this. My only reservations about the book are that it is for an American audience, (I think a British version coudl be written) and the descriptions of other cases I found too upsetting shortly after the attack.On the whole though, an excellent book and I have recommended to all people I have met who have had a similar experience to mine."
5,"For survivors and their family, friends, significant others","This book was one of the first I read after my rape a little over 2 years ago. I read this book in one day and handed it to my boyfriend to read it. It really helped me understand what I was going through and why. My boyfriend, at the time, was able to read it and was bale to further understand my anger, guilt-- all of the feelings that I was dealing with. Although one cannot fully understand those feelings unless you have gone through it yourself; this book does help family members, friends, and lovers understand as much as they can. I really recommend this book especially if you were recently raped. Please, also remember though that just reading a book and not seeking therapy will not help you recover fully. Seeking help from a person with experience in rape and sexual assault will help as well as reading, journaling, and speaking to friends and family."
1,Retarded and lame (desperate living only),"I know it's supposed to be bad, but I didn't know it was supposed to be useless. Nevermind the amateurish everything, that's fine, it just wasn't funny (maybe a line here or there). Not inspired just dumb, keep your cult. John Waters still seems like a great guy though."
4,POLYESTER and DESPERATE LIVING,"POLYESTER is a comedy from director John Waters that takes a look at the dark side of suburban life. Francine Fishpaw is a woman with a dysfunctional family: her husband owns a pornography theater and is having an affair with his secretary, her daughter is pregnant and wants to have an abortion, and her son has a foot stomping fetish. Soon, Francine begins to fall in love with a man who owns an art-house movie drive-in named Todd Tomarrow. This is the first John Waters movie that I ever saw, and I've become a fan of many of his films since.DESPERATE LIVING is a ""monstrous fairy tale"" about a mental patient named Peggy Gravel and her maid Grizelda who escape to a town populated by criminals that are ruled by the demented Queen Carlotta after they've accidentally killed Peggy's husband. There's a lot of sick, twisted, disgusting, and perverted humor throughout the film to entertain the whole family. This is one of John Waters best films next to PINK FLAMINGOS."
4,A cut above for John Waters,I always liked John Waters stuff - this seems to be a cut above...even for Divine.
5,Very groovy,"If you like John Waters, you'll love this movie. It's pretty much mainstream, but has the twisted characters that Waters is famous for. My fave characters are LuLu, Dexter and Bobo. Lulu is so funky and cool. If you like sick, twisted movies, this one's for you."
3,TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY,THIS FILM IS REALLY FUNNY. DIVINE AS USUAL IS GREAT IN IT. ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THEY SAY SOME REALLY FUNNY LINES. EDITH MASSEY AND DIVINE ARE TWO OF THE FUNNIEST CHARACTERS EVER. THERE'S NOTHING BAD I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT! LOVE IT!
3,Just like another said the ending changed my rating,"I was bored flipping through the channels and stumbled upon this movie. Throughout the movie it was a typical B movie, but what the heck I didn't have anything else to do. So the acting wasn't great the story line was strange and his partner was a freak. Didn't make much sense until the end, I am usually pretty good at guessing endings. This gets my wife upset when we watch a movie and 30 minutes into it I know who done it per say. This movie totally surprised me and the ending was to me absolutely amazing if you can make it that far.So if you have time to kill and want to watch a B movie with a great ending this is for you. Some of the people that gave this a bad review, I think they forgot it is a B movie. I mean seriously were not talking ""Heat"" here so just remember it is what it is with what I thought to be a great ending that was totally unexpected."
2,Acceptable but boring B Movie,"I bought this movie mainly because of the cast for this film--Thersa Russell, Steve Bauer, and Michael Pare--top actors of B movies. Boy, was I disappointed. Boring plot that jumps over the place and hard to follow. Not an interesting film at all --avoid this one!!!"
2,A B- movie at best,"Looks like a low budget, direct to dvd movie, this one. The 'stars' are not too well known and the script, well, let's just say it leaves a bit to be desired. At least the voice-over narration by the main character keeps us apprised of what's going on, sort of, but the constant screen shot time signatures are a bit pretentious. At least the whole thing isn't too long, but there's a bit too much gratuitous violence. And some of the acting is amateurish at best."
4,"Another ""got ya"" movie.","I actually liked this movie a lot mostly because after getting to the end, I was SO surprised by it that I went form its just OK to way cool. Once you know the end, watching it again, changes how you ""see"" the actors responses.Pare` is really good in it once you understand his actions which are kind of bland through most of the movie until the final scenes where he comes on strong. Russell is great with her script. Definitely worth a bit of change."
5,Wonderful book,I read this book in the early 70s. I loved it. Well written and a wonderful story line. I have wanted to re read this book and now I can.
5,Great Read,"This Historical fiction novel is an amazing read. Not only does the author incorporate real events, but also fictional events that draw the reader in. His writing style is great and it keeps you interested to the last page! Great book!"
2,Only good for flat surfaces,"This is fine if you're only using it on flat surfaces. It will fall apart under weight if you're on an incline. In our case, we were lucky that the lantern wasn't lit... we only lost the glass around the lantern, rather than starting a fire."
3,Last chapter unnecessary,"I felt the last chapter of this book was unnecessary. It was as though the writer either couldn't decide when to stop or she hadn't used enough words so added an extra chapter (picking up the story two years later). Instead of finishing the story on a high - with everything neatly concluded, it was more of an 'oh there's more...'"
3,True comedy,George Carlin was a true pioneer for stand up comics. This product reminded me why I still enjoy his work.
5,Carlin at Carnegie,Carlin at his best. This dvd is very funny. It was sad to watch Carlin go from a funny stand-up to a grouchy old man.
4,Top of His Form,"Another HBO special.One of my favorite bits is picky eater, partly since I was one as a child, too. George tells us things we never thought about concerning dogs and cats. And he's expanded his list of seven dirty words by quite a lot: the closing credits roll while he's reading a long scroll of all the ones he could think of."
4,What is a female Peacock?,"George Carlin is a funny little (bleep), but not for little (bleep) kids, you know? Because George Carlin isn't for kids. His most famous routine is updated as he adds more words you can't say on TV. Very funny man!"
4,Handy for all headphones,"These are handy for all sorts of headphones, not just for the earbuds that will store in the holes. They are made of softer, more flexible material than the Sumajin Smartwraps and seem a bit more secure. I have several sets of headphones which offer varying degrees of sound isolation, and so I have equipped them all with these handy little reels. Not a big deal, but it does make controlling the extra cord length simple."
4,Works great,"I like the design that the ear buds can be stored in the two holes. The color choices of red, black and grey are just too boring. I thought I ordered the pastel green, blue and orange, but I was shipped the red, black and grey. Other than the color disappointment, the items worked great."
1,A complete waste of time,"Someone gave me this book--why, I'll never know. I liked Queen a lot once. Do the remaining members know a supremely bad poet has written a tedious book about them? Someone should let them know.The writer seems to be one of those guys who obsessively remembers stuff about marginal subjects and likes to spout that info. But then he hit on the perfect career path--a poet! So now he can footnote bad poetry with obscure references and call it a book."
4,Bits and bobs left over from other work.,"When his literary brother Lawerence Durrell (the Alexandra Quartet) compiled a book of stray writings he brought them together under the title ""Spirit of Place"" as they revolved around the mediterranean spirit. When the irrereverent younger brother Gerald decided to trawl his notes for a new book to fund his zoo in Jersey he jokingly suggested to Lawerence that he could call it ""Fillets of Plaice"", being a low caste version of his brothers book. The name stuck and this book contains some wonderful and evocative stories. Best of all I think are the two horror stories at the end. I never realised Gerald had such a dark side."
2,"if I had friends like these I'd hide it, not publish it?","This fellow pretends to be a naturalist, butseems to be a kind of busybodywho rats the bad news out about his friends and family?I had a hard time reading the whole thing:I almost chucked on the first storyabout the ice box on a Greek motor fishing boat,and the family vacation.I suppose that is you are making the most of old biographical stories these must have interested somebody for them getting published.The author just gives me a pain in my fillet."
1,Poor plot and product placement = never again,"I'm using my Compaq V75 to write this negative review as I drink my Coca-Cola... I got so tired of brand names as I forced myself through this! Other reviewers here have accurately mentioned that the fires were poorly explained, the horse issue is never clarified. It's fairly obvious that, since Carrie's body was never recovered, that she'll rise from the dead in the next book. Ho hum. I was so consistently annoyed with the lack of craft in this book that I'll never read another of her books again."
1,"Trite, tired characters who've become UNINTERESTING.","Like some of the other reviewers, I'm really disappointed with this latest from PC. Her early books were worthy of a best-seller list, but certainly not her latest few, this one included. I'm really sick of the Benton angle...why can't we have people who work together without the romantic angle? In the early books, he was happily married...suddenly we find him and Kay with grand passion for each other which takes away from the suspense angle. I liked her early books for the suspense. If I want romance, I'll read romance novels. I'm also sick of the Lucy angle. Kay is really neurotic about Lucy. She's grown and has her own life; PC, give it a break. I think PC needs to develop new characters. Marino is the only one I still like. Fortunately, I checked this one out from the library and didn't waste my money. It's not worth it. Post Mortem was a great book. What happened to you, PC? Fame catch up with you?"
2,Lose Lucy.,"The book was a real page turner, in the sense that I couldn't turn pages fast enough in a scan for a break in the tedium. Where was the story? Exquisite villianess Carrie could have saved this book, and yet I don't think she was given a full paragraph.What once was fascinating narrative has become interminable forensic techno-babble. Marino remains the only halfway interesting character, and now, horrifyingly, his inner child seems poised to emerge. And PC, if you need to get rid of somebody, next time how about the insufferable, ever sullen, tortured Lucy."
1,can we please have something new?,"Pat, Pat, Pat! I know life hasn't been a barrel of laughs lately but does Kay Scarpetta have to suffer as well? Not to mention your readers! We are constantly having Kay and Lucy's insight/ brilliance praised to the skies, don't they have any personal resources? Or doctors?I'm almost too bored by all this emotional self-gratification to ask - How did those fires get so hot? Maybe Scarpetta's personal black cloud obscured my view when I read that bit!As for you-know-who's demise --- better dead than stuck with that self-involved woman.Sorry Pat, cheer up! I'm willing to give you another try. I've enjoyed your books in the past. Could Kay and Lucy please have some fun? Could we also have some new crimes committed by people we haven't already met? If the obvious sequel to Point comes into being, could you please explain the fires- I lie awake for minutes each night.....just wondering."
2,Who's left to kill?,"Cornwell has become the new Anne Rice, as far as I'm concerned. You can't help wanting to read her because she grabbed you in the past, but what she's offering us is such a diluted form of what she used to write that it doesn't make sense to continue the habit. I didn't read Hornet's Nest because others told me it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on -- but I didn't want to believe that another Kay Scarpetta novel would follow suit. Patricia, it's time to rethink your plots and characters!!! Habit only lasts so long before it becomes a form of compulsion. Since I'm not a compulsive person, Cornwell, I fear, has lost me."
1,A weak and repeative plot line - wouldn't recommend it,"I was thoroughly disappointed in Cornwell's latest effort. The plot is a recycled one as are the characters. Cornwell didn't even tie up the loose ends in the technical explanations of the fires' fuel sources. The ending reminded me of a bad soap opera,where without a body to identify one knows that the character will return..... Enough already...I thoroughly enjoyed her first books. However the last three seemed to have been ""phoned in"". ""Point of Origin"" reminded me of a screenplay for a ""Summer Blockbuster"" gone bad complete with one dimensional characters and lots of fire and explosions! Given the high quality of Cornwell's early works, this effort deserves less than one star."
3,Enough with Lucy,Patricia Cornwell is a very capable writer who has provided us with many enjoyable reads but the repetitive angst over niece Lucy gets too much for this reader. This time Dr. Scarpetta is too much in touch with her feelings.
2,It's getting hard to take,"(1) I am not interested in Patricia Cornwell's political views, which seem to erupt from every character's mouth, esp. Scarpetta's. Is it possible she's changed editors? That would explain this phenomenon, as well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are in desperate need of editing. It's fairly typical for a bestselling author to suffer under bad editing b/c people feel they can't say anything to her.(2). Why kill Benton Wesley? He was the only thing that made Scarpetta seem even vaguely human.(3). What is the purpose of the Lucy character? She seems to be getting weirder and weirder. If the point is to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians, even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious security risk, well, I am still not convinced."
2,Scarpetta is a complainer,"I gave up on Cornwell several books ago, but picked this one up at the library for one more shot. My initial annoyance with the heroine was that she is such a belly-acher: ain't it awful what I have to do, dealing with dead bodies and all. I disliked the token love story with Wesley, who had a perfectly nice wife and family, as being introduced for people who are more interested in sex than in mysteries. Her preoccupation with her niece is obsessive. So I find that this book is worse in all the above. If Kay Scarpetta finds her job so disagreeable, why doesn't she just quit and do something else? I'd like to see a positive attitude here. I am not dazzled by all the techno-garbage. Let's have a heroine I can care about. Scarpetta, resign and get a job in a factory and let Lucy live her own life."
1,"It&#65533;s my first Cornwell&#65533;s book, and it&#65533;s my last.","A bitter middle aged self righteous medical examiner Kay, a bitter pathetic crying baby Lucy who can an access database and fly helicopter, a bitter foul mouthed cop with profanity in every single sentence, together were looking for a bitter psychopath Carrie who liked to kill with knife and fire.I wish Carrie killed them all half way into the book.Other reviewers have said enough..."
2,Flimsy research,"I know it had nothing to do with the overall story of the book, but when PC was describing the process of shoeing a horse - and had the farrier sitting on a stool while doing it - I had to put the book down - for days. I have owned horses for years, used several different farriers, in different states and they all use the same basic technique and NONE of them have used a stool - I can't even fathom how they could correctly shoe a horse while seated. It wouldn't have taken but a few minutes to phone a local farrier in her area, maybe even visit a stable while the farrier was working. It seems in all her other books she has taken such pains to give accurate details, so the reader really feels like they are there (or Kay is really there), but she missed the mark this time. I also felt she placed too much emphasis on Lucy's lesbianism in this book. Fine, she's gay, let's just get on with the story already! This was not one of her best efforts."
3,Anger and anguish,"Once again, Patricia Cornwell has come up with a first rate mystery. It will probably be the last one by her that I read, because frankly, I'm weary of the angst of her characters. Kay Scarpetta is a lonely, driven, sad woman who has a lonely, driven, sad niece. Neither of them seems quite real. Is there any joy or love in their lives? Doesn't seem so, and it's tiring.The villain of the piece -- Carrie Grethem -- will undoubtedly turn up again in the next novel. Her demise was not certified, and I can't read one more word about a woman who can manipulate any and all circumstances at her pleasure.As I said, the mystery was a good one, if a bit gory. But nothing good, or fun happens to any of the protagonists. When we leave them this time, it's at the scene of a funeral, and I can't help but believe that their sad lives will just go on in this vein as long as we buy the books. I've bought my last one."
2,Disappointing after waiting for this one.,"I almost gave up on the book about one third of the way through, but because of loyalty to the author, I kept plugging along. Although it does get a bit more like a Cornwell story, the Lucy plot line is basically not interesting."
3,A little disappointed in this one!,"I am a great fan of Kay Scarpetta novels. I have readeveryone. I liked Kay because she was a strong, sure woman. I alsoloved the powerfulness of Benton Wesley. This book took us on a different trip completely and one that was not enjoyable. The relationship between Kay and Benton deteriorated from very romantic in previous novels, to ""comfortable"". They didn't even share bedrooms anymore. Is the way Ms. Cornwall sees long term relationships? As becoming comfortable with each other, and no romance exists any longer. Sex becomes an act that these people do to satisfy a basic hunger, not because they feel genuine emotion. However, I will say the book was interesting and held my attention until the final chapters. What happened to Benton is unforgivable... Too much! And the ending left little doubt as to who we would see in the next book... I was not impressed this time around."
3,"Good, Could Have Been Better","While I like the plot -- and especially the fire aspect -- the lack of face-to-face contact with Carrie made Carrie's appearance in ""Point of Origin"" somewhat pointless. I also didn't like what happened to a main character in the Scarpetta novels. I do like the depth of Kay Scarpetta -- readers know a lot of her quirks and mindset. Her tragic romatic life has simply got to take a turn for the better -- no one can have the run of bad luck she's had!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","I enjoyed Point of Origin, however felt that her previous novels were much better. I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's stories, so will continue to be a fan. However, I feel that she could have done alot more character development and gotton into areas of Kay Scarpetta's life that needed more exploring."
3,"Stiff writing, but entertaining","PC has brought back Scarpetta's nemesis, Carrie Grethen, to bind this tale's plot together. Unfortunately, Carrie's escape is totally unbelievable and PC must have realized this herself because she uses a convenient plot-hole plug by explaining that it was unexplainable. The narration and dialogue are both stiff--a PC characteristic--but it's improving and after two or three more novels she may write like a novelist instead of a case worker. Irritations? Kay is the unhappiest character I've ever met in a novel. There is no warmth to her; she has no interests beyond sticking her hands into a cold body. Even so, I would recommend this title to others--though it will likely be my last PC read. Sorry."
1,Time to retire Kay until you can write her well again....,"I'm almost finished with this book and don't even know if I want to continue reading it. This has been thoroughly disappointing. As an addition to an extremely strong series it's weak at best. As a stand alone book if you've never read any of the other books in the series, it's almost unpublishable. The entire plotline took an excruciating amount of pages to develop and when it finally did it was anti-climactic. Not a page turner by any means.By the way, the introduction of the Teun character is about as see-through as it gets. Okay, Patricia, we all get it. Kay is going to make it all the way to midlife and then discover she's bi-sexual. Before reading this book I would have given the author more credit than to borrow so heavily from her own life instead of relying on creativity and imagination. Sad. I will not be racing out to buy anymore Kay Scarpetta books."
2,"Very, Very disappointed here.","Kay Scarpetta has been a favorite of mine (Lucy also). Until this book! Unfortunately feel that Cornwell is going the way of ""Dianelle Steel"" & others: simply writing to publish. Such a shame! This book spends Way too much time on medical details; little or no plot; have about fifteen/twenty pages to go right now and frankly, do NOT care how she finishes. Writer appears to be so negative and hostile throughout this book, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Seek therapy Dr. Scarpetta!!!,"Is this mystery or soap opera? Or Grand Opera? I have read all the other Kay Scarpetta novels and they are becoming ever more angst-filled. I'm surprised Dr. S has not given up her job, given how miserable it seems to make her. Now another lover lost? Does it never end??!! I, on the other hand, am severing my ties with this depressed and depressing old friend."
1,yech.,"This is my third Patricia Cornwell novel and she's 3 for 3. You can't say I haven't tried. Stupid story, meandering plot and a testament to the mediocre tastes that make a book a best seller."
2,disappointing . . .,"i'm a big fan of cornwell's, but this book didn't do it for me. i didn't buy the fact that carrie is so brilliant that every single thing she does is on purpose so that scarpetta finds out about it. lucy needs a kick in the head."
4,Cornwell is good even when she not in top form,"I ordered Point of Origin, Triumph and the Glory, and Left Behind three weeks ago and finally got time to read them. Point of Origin was the best of the three, probably because I like mysteries better than anything else. Kay Scarpetta is one of the great fictional characters of the last several years, I can really relate to her. The plot is pretty contrived in spots but Cornwell is so skilled at what she does that the overall effect of the book is still laudatory. I just ordered her new one and am primed to read it next."
1,What's happening?,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell since her first book, but lately her plots are weak. She turned Kay into an unlikable character. She does not act like the public offical that she is supposed to be. Her plot lines are also getting similar; Kay loves a character then he dies. The book does provide some good medical information, but the characters are getting too strange. If you want to read some good medical trillers, read the previous books. They have better plots and characters."
4,Engrossing but sadly abrupt,"I loved the gore, but Cornwell has this disturbing habit of bringing in the heinous murderer right in the last 10 of the 300 pages. The fun is in kicking yourself for not having known all along that X was the bad guy, not in finding him at the very end and having him dashed to pieces."
4,Engrossing but sadly abrupt,"I loved the gore, but Cornwell has this disturbing habit ofbringing in the heinous murderer right in the last 10 of the 300pages. The fun is in kicking yourself, and not having known all along that X was the bad guy, not in finding him at the very end."
4,Point of Origin,"Point of Origin was the first Kay Scarpetta novel to make mecry. I don't think I can forgive Patricia Cornwell for 'killing' one of the main characters, but that doesn't mean that I didn't think this was yet another brilliant story. It's amazing how Patricia Cornwell manages to grab my attention from the first few sentences of every book she writes. Everytime she publishes a new Scarpetta novel, it's like meeting up with old friends, Kay, Lucy and Marino. Point of Origin is a sort of cry for more humanity in the world, and this message is wrapped up and spoken out by Kay, who is heartbroken throughout most of the book. The scene in which she discovers the body in the burnt-down house made me cry so much, especially as, as every reader knows, this man meant so much to Kay. I am now reading 'Black Notice' and the letter at the beginning of the book made this feeling come back and I cried again."
3,Not Bad,"I really liked this book, though not as much as others like Postmortem and Unnatural Exposure. I thought she could have went more into the some of the charcters, but on the morbidity level....it was awesome"
4,An improvement compared to recent works,"I found this book to be a great improvement when compared to recent works by PC. It was nice to see Marino show some emotion. Lucy is getting to be a bore, though. The unexpected loss of a vital character was heart-breaking. Very few books have brought me to tears like this did. I was disappointed with the lack of face-to-face confrontation with the ""bad guy"". Carrie's character could have used some more depth and inclusion. We never even got to meet her partner! The ""Point of Origin"" for the fires was never really explained. The focus was centered on the other aspect of the crimes. The ending could have been developed a little better. It left much to be desired. I look forward to reading her latest release, hoping the improvement trend continues."
3,Not Cornwell's best Scarpetta book...,"...but I'm glad that I read it. I enjoy Cornwell's Scarpetta series because it is thrilling and interesting. I am a big forensics fan. However, I felt as though Point of Origin was more like a technical manual than a story. I feel that From Potter's Field was her best book."
3,"What do fires, pyschos, and lesbians have in common?","This was my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I should have read Body Farm first. The characters and plotline are a carryover from Body Farm. The book was a quick read, and for the most part, the action intrigued me. The autopsy details were fascinating. However, the ending was unrealistic and dissappointing. I cannot believe the psycho killer could possibly get into the head of Kay Scarpetta and anticipate her every move. There were also some unanswered questions that left me unsatisfied. I did appreciate most of the locale, however, since I have been to most of the sites."
2,disappointing,"I have read most of Ms. Cornwell's novels and was sadly disappointed in this one. While I usually enjoy the scientific detail in her books, I found this one tedious and hard to follow. I didn't even shed a tear over you-know-who! At any rate, hopefully the next one will be better!"
3,Cornwell Clogs A Bit,"Ms. Cornwell brings us her 9th thriller featuring ME Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In ""Point Of Origin"", there are several plots twisting and turning the reader. Sick psycho Carrie returns from ""Body Farm"" to threaten Kay and retired FBI boyfriend Benton Wesley. Add a special assignment from the government, to now help forensically in the case of a burnt to the ground horse farm...including a body, and Dr. Kay has her hands full.I enjoyed this book. However, at times I felt the scenes were perhaps overwritten, clogging down the penned rich rhythms we are accustomed to. Or, maybe there was just TOO much going on.....rather dizzying, like several kittens bouncing about with frazzled balls of colorful yarn.Ms. Cornwell apparently was getting EVERYTHING in to complete this series. And for Scarpetta fans, there are some sad endings besides the series.Still a classic Cornwell chiller.Thanks for your interests & comments--CDS"
2,Kay should open a Pediatrics practice.,This entry in the series was the least enjoyable in recent memory. So much death and blood it is no wonder everybody seems on the verge of suicide. Kay clearly hates her work but continues to be attracted to death like a moth to a flame. She really needs to do something different. Maybe a good family practice for the next book will set her straight. Ms Cornwell is still among the best of this genre and I will await the next book to see if Kate plunges further into depression but I do long for some of the fresh originality of the earlier efforts.
4,The first 93% of the book was excellent.,"Point of Origin contains the usual Cornwell trademarks - technical detail, action, and suspense. The author also includes past characters , creating a link to other books, thereby giving the reader a feeling that he is part of the story. However, the ending left me dissatisfied. Ms Cornwell seemed in a hurry to get rid of the antagonists. The final confrontation could not actually be called a ""face off,"" since they do not meet face to face. Even with this small discrepancy, though, Point of Origin still kept me reading when I should have been working."
4,Superb medical mystery; a plot twist I could do without.,"As usual, Patricia Cornwell has written a wonderfully exciting medical mystery that kept me glued from beginning to end. I enjoyed this book because of its plot direction and end-of-my-seat suspense. Additionally, the reappearance of a previous character, Carrie, brings an entirely new element to this story - previous readers know this character and want some type of resolution, especially me! Patricia Cornwell resurrects previous characters, namely Benton, Marino and her niece, Lucy. I, for one, love these characters and always want to read more about them. Furthermore, this book truly rounded out these characters for me, as I learned more about them in this particular novel. Finally, the author is not afraid to take chances with her work; while I may not always agree with her plot twists on a personally emotional level, Patricia Cornwell definitely knows what she's doing!"
5,Patricia Cornwell is back in good form!!,"After Unatural Causes I was hesitant to buy Point of Origin,eventhough I find Kay Scarpetta so intriguing. But PoO is super, agreat read, could not put it down."
3,"satisfying, story wise but dreary for emotions","Cornwall is backing herself into a corner with her misery - aren't any of her characters allowed any happiness? She's only got Lucy, Marino or herslf to kill off - lighten up - writer,"
3,"Good, but could have been better","I feel that PC has touched up on certain aspects of her plot (like her habit of always making Kay out into Wonderwoman), and as she said in her Amazon interview, PoO is sinister, a lot darker than the rest of the series. Yet I could not help but feel a tad disappointed at the way she chose to solve the 'main mystery' this time round, and yes, I did think some parts were rather contrived and well am I going to say this - commercialised. Still, if you are a PC fan, like I am, you will buy the book and you should too!"
4,"Great, one of her best in a long time","I really enjoyed Point of Origin. There is no sentimentality, Scarpetta still cannot enjoy a happy love life and i enjoyed this realism. It was great to see Lucy back and i look forward to when Lucy can start to take on her own cases."
4,"Better than Hornets Nest, but not her best","I just finished Point of Origin and have to admit that it was darker than most of her others. I hated Hornets Nest, so I figured Ms Cornwell could only improve with this one. Like another reader, I would have liked to learn more about how the fires started, burned so hot, etc. Her technical stuff was top notch, as always. I think Ms. Cornwell needs to lighten up a bit, though. Look forward to her next Scarpetta novel."
3,Beware the spoilers in reviews that follow.,"First, I must warn you that some of the reviews that follow reveal major plot points. I am still angry at the ""reader from Brooklyn"" who spoiled what would have been a suprise for me. If you don't want the plot spoiled for you, read cautiously!I have read all the Scarpetta novels, and I am afraid I am disappointed in this one. Definately NOT one of her better efforts. It is somewhat revisionist and very dark and grim. It is not something I would recommend if you are already depressed.I'm hoping Patricia gets into a better mood for the next one!"
5,An Incrediable Book!!!!,"This book kept me personally on the edge of my seat. It was refered to me by a friend and I thouroughly enjoyed it. It was an action packed mystery that included ""adventures"" of Dr. Kay Scarpetta and her Antagonist Carrie Gretchen. It really puts you ine setting...(It kept me up at night). Point of Origin was the first Cornwell book i have read and it led me to enjoy others such as From Potter's Feild and Bodycount. I inquire those of you who are Mystery or Patricia Cornwell bluffs to read it.~A new found Patricia Cornwell Bluff in Arizona"
3,"MAIN CHARACTER DIES, SKIP REVIEWS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!","The following reviews give away HUGE plot details. Skip them if you want to enjoy the book. I read the reviews, and was really upset that so much of the plot was given away. This is a good book, darker than usual, and much more depressing. I have been a Scarpetta fan, and I liked it."
2,"Characters seemed tired, old and angry.","I was disappointed in this book. I've loved the Kay Scarpetta series, but this one felt old, angry, and tired. Lucy should be beyond the rebellious years, and her constant struggles with Kay are a bit too much clash for my liking. It feels as if the series is in decline. Although the storyline was intriguing and the plot intense, I am not looking forward to the next (if there is one) Kay Scarpetta novel."
2,A warning: both disturbing and disappointing,"Fair warning to Cornwell fans: I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series for years, but this one was so excessively gory that I won't buy another Cornwell book. If you're new to reading Patricia Cornwell, I would recommend starting at the beginning of the series and skipping this one."
1,very disappointed,"I did not like this book, Dr. Scarpetta's character is very negative of everything and everyone, including her friends and family. I have been a fan for a long time and I was really suprised and disappointed by this book."
2,A Mediocre Effort,"Not the best of her books, but definitely the most emotional of the books. Cornwell has become one of my favorite writers, but this novel fell short. The plot was good, but not well developed. The relationships between her characters seem strained. Dr. Scarpetta seems unusually overprotective and overbearing toward her niece, Lucy, and the exit of Benton was a poor choice especially since their relationship was just starting to take off. Hopefully the next book will pull her out of the rut of her last few bad efforts."
3,Even a mediocore Cornwell book is better than most author's,"This book did hold my interest, although her earlier books were more thrilling. Dr. Kay Scarpetta should have her own network televison show (like Quincy)."
2,Disappointing,"I am a dedicated P. Cornwell fan, but was somewhat disappointed when I read ""Point of Origin"". The CONTINUED story line of Lucy's trials and tribulations regarding her lesbian lover and the characters of Carrie Grethen and Temple Gault have been exhausted. I definitely think Scarpetta, Marino, and Benton Wesley need to move on. They're such great characters, but have gotten bogged down. Still, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Scarpetta novel."
4,Solid follow-up of the trials of kay my favorite forensic MD,"I enjoyed the continuation of the characters developed in the previous novels. The seeming loss of vigor and joy of life is very realistic since the loss is the result of slaying so many demons. Kay's determination and doubts are at odds in a very human way.If the novel reflects a declining joy on the part of the author to resurrect the characters for each new novel, I guess I can respect that and applaud her efforts. I know I have read and enjoyed all of her novels(Hornets Nest the least)."
1,Because I can't give it zero,"Postmortem, which won the Edgar award, was a great, intriguing mystery, with a somewhat disappointing ending. Sadly, each of Cornwell's subsequent books has been progressively worse, with Hornet's Nest nearing rock bottom. Point of Origin is at best a marginal improvement. After her miserable attempt at creating new characters in Hornet's Nest, Cornwell apparently decides to retread all too familiar ground. In her latest installment, she simply falls back on (ad nauseum) relationships and plots (even killers and their crimes) that she has already mangled. Perhaps she thought the additional gore would mask the fetid stench of her decaying storyline. -- Hey, if she can mix her melodramatic metaphors, so can I."
3,Too intense a twist to know if it was that good,"I hounded the library until they got this book on the shelf. Once I got it, I didn't put it down until I finished it. Overall, I think this book was far and above Hornet's Nest, but not as good as her earlier work. Kay has become a familiar character, kind of like an old friend. However, I can't really evaluate this book fairly because of the terrible twist it takes. We know from the dust jacket that Carrie does something terrible to Kay on a personal level. However, when I read what it was, it just stopped me dead in my tracks and everything else after that just seemed to be so unimportant. I would recommend this book to any Cornwell fan. It will be very interesting to see where Ms. Cornwell takes us from here."
3,Just doesn't measure up.,"As a Cornwell fan who has read all of her books (other than the Ruth Bell Graham biography), I have been disappointed with the latest in the series. I must agree with other comments made here that I am tired of Temple and Carrie and would like to see some fresh villains. I was unsatisfied with the ending feeling that she left it too ""open"" for use in future books.I will continue to read her series and hope that she continues to write ""Scarpetta"" books because I feel so familiar with the characters. I do miss the feelings that I was left with after reading ""Body of Evidence"" and ""Postmortem""."
4,This book was better than she has done in awhile.,"Patrica Cornwell is the best mystery writer working today. A bad Scarpetta novel is still more entertaining than 9 out of 10 other novels. I was disapponited in the last three Scarpetta novels but I believe she is getting back on track. Point of Origin moved quickly and I could not put it down. I still prefer the first four novels, they seemed to have more emphasis on the crime and less on Kay's personal life. I would like for her to go back to more original storeylines. Hopefully this is really the end of Gualt and Carrie. Now if the tiresome Lucy would just be sent elsewhere once in awhile, we might be getting somewhere again. Marino is the best thing that ever happened to Kay do you think she will ever notice?"
3,More like a movie than a book,"As a fan of Ms. Cornwell's previous work, this book was a big disappointment. This is a book that seems like it was intended to be a movie -- particularly the final ""confrontation"" (if it can be called that) between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys."" The book has a good basic concept, similar to one Cornwell has used before, but fails in its execution. In particular, difficult points are glossed over rather than explained. This book is, at best, a good summer read. And it probably will make a decent movie."
1,Very Disappointing,"I can not recall the last time when I actually stopped readinga book I had bought because it was so bad. This series has gotten progressively worse over the past few years until it has reached a point where it is practically unreadable. Kay Scarpetta has become totally unlikeable, the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass."
1,the reader from pittsburgh needs help quick,"this was a bog standard novel with a poor story which was not even properly explained in the end and it left loads of plot holes and red herrings just hanging in the air. It was full of poor spelling and even poorer grammar. It was also full of brand name dropping and bad characters. A friend recommended this book but I won't be passing on that dubious priviledge. We never even got to see the baddie in this book, after 400 pages! Though it is obvious this story is ripe for a sequel. Cornwell is also a sicko, killing off benton and those horses, and what about that horse that lived. The five star reviews must be from the official fan club, the one star reviews are from people who have read more widely than their local airport stockist."
2,what about explanations,"I thought that this book lack what every other book did. Cornwell did not fully explain the point of origins of the fires. I also did not like the fact that Kay had finally found someone she truly loved and loved her and was cut from the series. there was no point. Is she going to pine away as a lonely divorcee? Lucy is becoming a more interesting character though. As the series has progressed, Lucy has slowly become a real character, not just the smart niece."
2,Disappointing in contrast to Cornwell's earlier works,"Point of Origin got off to a good start, but at some point Patricia Cornwell seemed to get lost in her own plot. The conclusion has an almost ""deus ex machina"" effect as Cornwell finds her culprit in a character who is mentioned but never actually introduced. To link this culprit to murders introduced in an earlier work without any evident association is stretching the reader's credulity to the breaking point. And to simply ""kill off"" a major recurring character -- unforgiveable! I have long been a fan of Ms Cornwell's books -- have read all of them -- but Point of Origin was indeed a disappointment."
1,A once-fine series descends to hackwork.,"The early Kay Scarpetta novels are quite good, but by this point Cornwell's just going through the motions. This novel lacks for just about everything. I think it was only inertia which kept me going to its completely unsatisfactory ending."
1,Doesn't even pass flying time,"I really, really wanted to enjoy this book -- I bought it to read on a 23-hour flight! The fact that I have picked it up again, two months after getting home, and find a boarding pass marking page 33 (when I gave up on it) tells the story. This book is so over-written and completely lacking in humanity and humor that it could not even while a plane journey away. I thought at the time that I was perhaps not being fair, being jetlagged already, so have picked it up several times since getting back home. But so far I have not got much farther than the boarding pass. This book does not even read as if it was written by Patricia Cornwell. I loved her first few books, and physician friends agree that she never put a foot wrong in her description of autopsies, but boy, this one is really bad. Give it a miss, if you are a new Cornwell reader; read the earlier ones instead."
2,Disappointment!!,"I have enjoyed the previous books with Dr. Scarpetta but thethrill is wearing off. The character is really starting to work on mynerves. Cornwell has created a saintly snob. The good doctor can do no wrong while the people around her have many flaws. The story gets off track with constant attention being given to Lucy and her lesbian lover. I felt like Cornwell was preaching instead of entertaining. The constant references to money were annoying. Expensive house, car, watch, etc. I wanted more suspense and interesting crime solving techniques. This book became a ""poor Lucy"" story with Kay whinning about Benton. To love or not to love! ... Carrie's accomplice was hard to believe. I hope the next book will stick more to the crime. Better luck next time Cornwell!"
2,Not good at all,"I was really excited when I bought this book, I was told that Scarpetta was a brilliant charicter and the books were really good. I bought it, I took it home and I tried so hard to get into the book, even half way through I wasn't engrossed. The charicters lacked emotion and the whole book dragged on and on going into to much detail about nothing at all.Some of the pathology was interesting to read about but on the whole this book was very poor."
1,LEFT HANGING,"It is unfortunate that Benton had to die. I didn't see it coming. Marino and Lucy were their usual selves. What got me was the ending. I felt that there wasn't a clear ending to the book. Ok, Lucy shoots down the other chopper. But the reader isn't given a CLEAR impression that Newton and Carrie were in the chopper. That all seems to be presumed by the writer. How can you end a book like that? It's like there is no closure."
3,"Well, I'm done...","...no, not with the book, but with Patricia Cornwell. Done, done, done. Psychotic deranged serial killers who can keep it together enough to outwit, outfox, outplay and outlive the entire FBI and ATF? What is this Carrie person -- the boogey woman? Kaiser Soze? And Lucy -- no, no more please. Uncle! She is such a high maintenance whiny pill, like Meadow Soprano. Am I the only one who finds the aunt-niece relationship between Lucy the Pill and Kay the Wonder Woman to be a little -- well -- ooky?This book was so lame I can't believe Patricia Cornwall actually wrote it, but I am going to finish it so I'll give it 3 stars."
3,Extremely annoying...........,"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book. Her character development was fine, but her insistence on delving totally into the depths of fire investigation and forensic testing was for me extremely tiresome. I think a little examination of fire investigation and forensic testing is fine, but the degree that she goes into it is sort of like asking someone what time it is and they tell you how to build a watch. Finally, the demise of Carrie and her boyfriend was just too easy."
2,Way Too Much Introspection & Not Enough Substance,"An average, yet thin storyline gets lost in characters, particulary KS and Lucy, spending far too much time feeling sorry for themselves and their inabilities to cope with life as a whole. With emotional instability such as Lucy's, it's not surprising she got the punt from the Fed's. A helicopter shootout as a climax - get real. Cornwell, put some serious effort into the next book and stop conning us."
2,When is Kay going to come out of the closet?,"Seems like the author is setting up a ""coming out"" book. She promotes homosexuality more than the plot of the story. This book was definitely not her best and the ending was a letdown."
2,Please get back to the basics,"I was disappointed in this book, but not as much as the last one. (KS was so arrogant-she completely turned me off!) This is really dark and depressing. I've read every book in the KS series and my favorites remain Postmortem and Body of Evidence. PC seems to have lost that ability to make us do double-takes over seemingly everyday, innocuous people and events. Get back to your old style of writing, PC. I miss those suspenseful, sleepless nights."
3,Not Quite as Exciting as Earlier Works,"While I enjoyed this book, it was not the sit on the edge ofyour chair book. Nothing new, no new villians, not an original story.Some of the story line is very sketchy. I do like the returning characters, Pete Marino, who is very down to earth... While this book is not as good as the rest, I will still look for future Cornwell books, but hope for more excitement, as in her earlier works."
2,The Big Yawner...,"After reading ALL of PC's prior Scarpetta books starting with Postmortem, this is the very first one where I found myself reading ANOTHER book in the process! Pretty much a complete waste of time and effort. It's a good thing PC doesn't make alot of California book signing appearance, because after reading Point of Origin, I wouldn't bother getting it signed...I think I'll start reading more M. Connelly, RN Patterson, James Patterson, Caleb Carr, Ridley Pearson, and P. Margolian etc."
3,To Catch a Murderer,"Did all the law enforcement agencies investigating the fire drop the ball or what? I could not believe the denoument in this one. The connection between murderer and victim been made much earlier. And Kay, I knew enough to not look in the freezer, and you are much smarter than me. I enjoyed the read until I realized who the murderers were - then I was shocked at the lack of basic investigative skills by all these experts. Too unbelieveable to be a Cornwell novel."
3,Another Dr. Kay Scarpetta page turner!,"Having just finished PC's newest release I find myself somewhat disappointed. There are several loose ends (horse farm), a very bitter Dr. Kay and look out, a shocking twist that will leave the reader stunned and dismayed. At the same time, I absolutely love all of PC's novels and will continue to buy them as soon as the new release hits the shelf. A lot more feelings came out of Kay this time around, can we blame her? As always, I didn't want the book to end and slowly read the last few pages, savoring every word. Overall, a good read."
4,Intriguing,"We found 'Point Of Origin' another one of Cornwell's excellentreading of and about Scarpetta's intriguing case load. Again once we got started we couldn't stop. We went from Hornest's Nest to Point of Origin so we know we are missing inbetween as some of the story didn't make sense and we had a feeling we had missed something. (Benton's & Scarpetta's affair and Benton's marriage breakup.) Hopefully this author will continue this story (no bodies found!) and now the 3 main characters will continue on with the struggle of trying to make a difference in their world. We won't give away the ending, but we all felt Kay's pain like we were right there at Hilton Head Island. Great reading 4 Christmas or 4 a gift."
3,Not what I expected,"Eventhough this was a page-turner which I didn't want to end,this was not as good as some of Cornwell's other novels. There is only a very thin story line, which could be told in much less than the 400 or so pages the book has now. It's just more of the same, and it seems like Cornwell's inspiration has run dry."

4,good intro to mystery on tape,"I loved this audiocassette and I listened to the UNABRIDGEDversion. It was slow at first but then, I never wanted it to end. Cornwell has a great way of enticing readers to read her other books by using the reoccuring characters. I love her explicit descriptions. I like how she is not afraid to kill off her main characters. You never know what to expect! I am going right out to buy another Kay Scarpetta novel in the series."
4,"It was good, even for a 'bad' book by her","I don't consider myself a big fan of hers, though given this I sure have read enough of her books. The are well written, well researched, great plots. I don't even mind that all her female characters are all superstars (a lot of women are superstars ). The negative for me was the whining, the doctor and her neice are big whiners. I will read another book by her."
3,Lots of ends untied,"I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the loose ends and unexplained elements. I also found the end of the book to be rushed, and rather contrived.In many ways, this book feels more like an outline. Detail about Carrie's personality disorder should go here, more details about Kay's inner feelings about Benton should go there, an investigation of how Carrie got involved with another maniac belongs in this chapter, a resolution for the colt belongs in that chapter.... In other words, the plot is good, but not fleshed out into a story."
5,Great Reading! What's Next?,"This book stands up to all of Patricia Corwell's writting. I've read every book she has written and am very disappointed that she hasn't written another. The way the characters always relate to the previous book keeps you looking forward to the next. Great reading, can't wait for the another."
3,not as good as it should have been...,"It seems that in the recent books Dr. Scarpetta is more detective than medical examiner. The early books were better. Also, Dr. Scarpetta's personal life is getting boring. Too much type being spent on Lucy, who is a mediocre character at best. Too much time is spent on Lucy's relations with other women. I used to look forward to reading Cornwell's books, now I am starting to wonder if I'll even bother with the next one... Oh, I probably will but I miss the suspense and good writing from the early books."
5,Original plot that really grips your emotions,An incredibly intense novel that was so good I read it in one weekend. It's the first time a Scarpetta novel made me weep. I'm just glad I didn't check the reviews until AFTER I was done.
4,Thrilling but sad.,I couldn't put the book down but can't believe Benton was killed. They were a team! Why? I can't believe PC would do that without having something in store for KS in the future. Please more books on Scarpetta and the sooner the better!
4,"so, so!","Patricia Cornwell is one of the best thriller writers and Kay Scarpetta is very fascinating, anyway, this last book is not as good as the fisrt ones."
2,Her newest and most depressing book,"As a Patricia Cornwell fan, I have anxiously awaited the arrival of each publication. When ""Point of Origin"" was released I could not wait to get my hands on it. After reading it I could not help but wonder what is going on in Conwell's life that would motivate her to write such a depressing, dark, disturbing novel. Kay Scarpetta is at odds with every character in the book. She seems at odds even with herself! The plot is grisly and graphic, not lightened with any humor or levity - a downward ghastly sprial. The book held my interest but left a bad taste in my mouth. I personally don't know why Kay was in fear of Carrie. If my life was that depressing, I would have welcomed the relief."
5,FANTASTIC as usual!!!,"This book was great. The plot keeps going on, and leaves you wondering if your first theory was right or wrong. Point of Origin kept me captivated as the story put me in the moods of each charactor. To be scarred, laughing, and crying in one book is amazing.Way to go Ms. Cornwell!!"
2,The last Scarpetta-novel I'll read.,"Point of Origin was the last drop for me. I am now so sick and tired of the 'heroine' that I can hardly stomach another try. The touchy-feely writing and the hugely dissapointing ending of this book is too much. I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed some of them, but this is it. And I say that WITH FEELING!"
1,"Lazy writing, moderately interesting plot","Ms Cornwall is getting very lazy... her style is now reduced to laying on the mood with a trowel, foreshadowing events so clearly that you wonder why you continue reading. She's clearly getting rid of some personal enmity toward the FBI in this book, which rather spoils the mystery itself. Following the poor quality of ""Unnatural Causes,"" she's going to have to pull her socks up pretty quickly if she hopes to retain her readers."
3,Adverbs/Barbara Bush Dedication,"I can live with a Barbara bush dedication, although it's no big draw for me.The adverb syntax is cumbersome. ""She sweetly said"" could be ""She lilted,"" ""She sang,"" ""She chirped,"" etc.However, the book is worth reading given the successful use of reverse foreshadowing--we obsess with her about Marino's health, then Benton bites it.Still, Cornwell should spend more time constructing her verbs so she doesn't have to bog us down with her adverbs."
3,"oh, oh","Cornwell outdoes herself. Carrie Grethen is back and the horrible tension is gut-wrenching. The psychological terror has been ratched up by tightly focusing on threats to Scarpetta, but that is becoming tiresomely predictable. I AM disappointed how ME Scarpetta has become the terrorized center of the plots, with her intelligent sleuthing receding into the background, and horror stories coming to the fore. I'm afraid how far crazed she'll go in the next book (both Scarpetta and Cornwell--they both need to take a break!). A new co-heroine is introduced, and a hero knocked off (wholly unexpected, that): Is Scarpetta being set up to become still another unhappy lesbian character in these novels? The ending is wonderfully set up: Cornwell had me beginning to mentally wonder off, thinking the story was to be continued later, when the twist hit like a fist in the kidneys. Wonderful effect, if a bit too abrupt."
3,HMMMMMM.......ALMOST A LOSS FOR WORDS,"Well Ms.Cornwell has once again given us the treat of yetanother novel with all our favorite characters, right down to CarrieGretchen. as I gazed at the book in the store and took notice of the new back cover photo (her in flight jacket w/heli in background) how did I know that she or Lucy would be a pilot. It is a well written book which as always, I had trouble putting down but some of the plot line, kind of out there. And the rubber swimmers cap come on, I dont think so. Semi-Kudos to you Ms. Cornwell and yes I will continue to read your novels even this one didnt keep you on the edge of your seat like your past one's. Just glad I waited for paperback version."
1,Why didn't she kill off Lucy?,"Scarpetta needs to unload that weird niece of hers, who refuses to be happy, and get rid of that pathetic Marino, who will never quit smoking no matter how many autopsies he his forced to witness. And Kay - well she needs a new job that does not force her to arm her home like a fortress. Cornwell's cast of characters lack hope and optimism - an unpardonable offense to the reader. Former fans would be better served if Scarpetta were to forsake her scalpels and invest in a good set of carving knives so she good more fully attend to her prowess as a kitchen maven. Perhaps she could play on her noteriety as a Medical Examiner to build a following for a cooking school.By the way - just out of curiosity - how many of you know the name of the medical examiner in your hometown??"
2,"Unsatisfying and in the end, just depressing.","I still think Scarpetta is a great character and that Cornwell is an above average writer but I get so fustrated that these books are so hit or miss. I've really loved most of them even though I feel all her endings are lacking. They come too abrubtly and are unsatisfying. This book however was just not as absorbing or exciting as most of her previous ones. I had to force myself to finish it because I figured out who was doing the bad stuff early on and yes, it was depressing. It left me in a bad mood. If Cornwell writes another one, yes I will read it. I do have hope that there is another great Scarpetta book in her."
3,Well written. Powerful. But be warned...,"Inside these pages is pain. And horrific violence that sadly feels real. I tried to stop reading, but felt compelled to finish. I've enjoyed all the books in the series, but I'm not sure if I'll read another."
3,Plot twist or emotional manipulation of reader?,"Point of Origin is filled with the fast paced, detail oriented writing fans of other Scarpetta books (I among them) have come come to relish. Details that would be gruesome are related in a ""clinical"" manner that renders them emotionally acceptable. In PoO, the horrific death of a character we have come to care about ""personalizes"" the crime to an extent I found disturbing. It smacks of an attempt to emotionally manipulate the reader in an unpleasant way. The book's ending is quite implausible--statistically, a murderer would do well to stay away from Kay. (By my count in 7 books I've read, murderer has been killed in 6, often by Kay. . .)"
3,Where is the suspensful ending?,"Having read every one of Cornwell's books, I keep stumbling over the fact that they end poorly. After all the tense and suspenseful build-up, I was let down again with the finale. It was similar to Temple Gault's death in the NY subway tunnel...anti-climatic and disappointing.However, before the final 50 pages, this book IS suspenseful and fulfilling. Cornwell does a fabulous job of developing the charcters. As a reader, I appreciate her willingness to have vulnerable characters and allowing them to even be killed...in varying fashions.I am hooked and will buy the next Scarpetta adventure. But unlike Robert Harris' fabulous ending to Silence of the Lambs, Kay Scarpetta gets off easy again."
2,Where is the real Patrica Cornwell?,"Patrica Cornwell has come and gone and unfortunately we are left with yet another book that fails to deliver the goods. Lacking in the fundamental teeth nashing, nail biting suspense of a good thriller, Point of Origin might well have been Point of No Return."
3,Nothing special - typical Kay Scarpetta,"After Hornets Nest tanked with readers and reviewers, Cornwell obviously needed to bring back Kay Scarpetta in a blockbuster to justify her $24 million two-book advance. This book doesn't make the grade. It's a typical Scarpetta in every sense. The more of these books Cornwell writes, the worse they become. The early ones were at least entertaining, if often unintentionally amusing for their blatant technical errors. The later ones have become fomulaic. Cornwell fans will like this book, but it's obvious that Ms. Cornwell is fresh out of ideas."
3,Time to lighten up,"Ms Cornwall seems to be in trouble. Each book is getting more depressing and more unbelievable. Is she just churning them out (waiting for a film script perhaps?) or is there no life left in Scarpetta? Point of Origin was more readable then the terrible Hornet's Nest but was no where near as good as the earlier books. Scarpetta needs to find a new case, a new villian and get on with what she does best"
3,Time to retire,"I have always rated Patricia Cornwell highly, but her books are definitely on a downward curve. I think that after the first two or three she ran out of ideas and new villains. In her new book coincidences abound, departed villains return to terrorise and the usual right wing platitudes abound. I think it is time to retire Scarpetta and think of something new. If Paretsky could do it so can Cornwell."
1,"Sorry, but this is my last Cornwell book","The charcaters in a series should bring some consistency from one installment to another. The protagonist in this series, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has degenerated into a paranoid BORING one dimensional irrational person. Her behaviors are simply not believable. A person who thinks and acts this way could not hold a job as a mortician, let alone a state's Chief Medical Examiner. This book was a struggle to work through. Its plot contrivances seemed to be thought up on the fly and slapped into the manuscript. At times, I was wondering if the author simply grabbed an old character (The evil Carrie) and tried to re-work her for the sake of meeting some kind of publishing requirement. I could never really get ""into"" the story...whenever I was slipping into the fictional world created by the author, the sloppiness or preposterousness of that world jarred me back into my own. A true disappointment and the last Cornwell book I'll ever read."
3,Love and hate for Kay,"While I read this book I had a lot of different feelings for Patricia Cornwells Kay Scarpetta. At last I just thought that I am sick of the dying of all of her friends. Mark, Benton...I couldn't believe his dead, I had to read the pages serveral times until I recognized that Patricia Cornwell is without any feelings for the readers who just liked the love between Kay and Benton, even if they had problems. That was one of the only points in Kays life that was happiness. It was not necessary to destroy it. It does not helpany furhter. The dark side of the books are now dominating, there is nothing left for loving. I am just waiting for the dead of Pete. Why has it to be so? the books are intense, thrilling and facinating but with the bad things and moods dominating they just get on my nerves. I will just stop reading these books. Faye Kellerman, Elizabeth George and other female writers are just more pleasant and as fascinating as Cornwell. good bye...."
2,Pissed me off. (Can I say that?),"This is where Cornwell should have stopped the series. She's now stretching it out for every dollar. Give me a break. It's done. Stop reading here if you don't want me to ruin a surprise in the book.......Still here? Killed off a very important character and then brings that character back to life in the next one. Reminds me of the season of the show ""Dallas"" where the writers changed their minds about killing off J.R. and made the whole season a dream. PLEASE. Lets see more of the characters in Southern Cross, etc."
2,Point of Origin needs a destination!,"My first ( and probably last ) Cornwell novel. I mean, come on. First a big fire, affecting Kenneth Sparkes, who is quickly made a minor character. A bunch of horses die, but one survives, why? Never explained. The bad guy appears almost as an afterthought. And the scary ""Carrie"" doesn't even get any facetime with Scarpetta! After all that worrying. And her niece, Lucy, belongs in a superhero comic book; FBI/ATF agent, Computer genius, Helicopter pilot, foxy woman. Yeah, right. I think Cornwell wrote this book as she was taking flying lesson, since the helicopter seems to be the main ( and most believable ) character. Great dialog, weak plot, boring details, messy ending."
1,Point of Departure,"I read this thing trapped in a Days Inn in NC whilst a hurricane went over; frankly I should have tossed it up into the eye. PC's own personal events have so transparently marched into this book: she dumps her FBI squeeze and squeezes up with his wife, so KS's FBI lurver has to get the elbow (or in this case a scalpel and a box of matches). What a dumb plot: a six yr old could have followed leads better than the idiots in this. The only redeeming features were that a few annoying people met their unsavoury ends. Second hand copy, as new, first edition, available here. Free."
4,"A little weaker, but still good","A very enjoyable read in the Kay Scarpetta series, although a bit weaker story than some of the others. Still, well worth your time to read."
4,Another Great Read,"Read this one in less than a day. Another great Cornwell thriller. I would have to agree that the ""Point of Origin"" was never thoroughly explained and the death of Benton was hard to believe. Honestly, I can wait to see where she takes the good Dr. in the next one."
4,Chilling an surprising,"A good Scarpetta, I was scared and hidden under my blanket, I couldn't help reading the novel from the beginnig to the end in one night. The killings and modus operandi are well described. One of my favorites Cornwell for the moment."
1,A potboiler of no distinction,"This was my first Scarpetta novel; it will be my last. Aflimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said, not ""intellectually challenging."" The characters are not credible: the women are overachieving amazons, the men are all cardboard cut-out cliches; even when the heroine's live-in is murdered, there's little genuine sense of loss.... The arsonist's methods take far too long to figure out -- a pointless ""mystery"" (I'm a Fire Marshal). The motivation of the serial killer is clinically wrong, an unabashed lift from ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" where the motivation was also wrong.... (See John Douglas, ANATOMY OF MOTIVE.) The final confrontation, fought with handguns between helicopters, is not credible, either -- in fact, downright Hollywood ""silly"" (I'm a pilot, too). The novel is a waste of time and money."
3,Good plot - psychology too lengthy.,"This is the first Scarpetta novel that I have read. The plot is well constructed and the book has the character of a good horror novel: You could even compare it to ""The Silence of the Lambs"". But the narrator indulges too much in self-reflection and an almost paranoid view of her surroundings. This is not conceivable in a person of her position. When she reflects about herself for pages, she takes the speed from a very good story. Such reflective passages are certainly necessary, but here they seem a bit exaggerated.Nevertheless, I will try another of the Scarpetta novels."
3,Enough with Lucy,Patricia Cornwell is a very capable writer who has provided uswith many enjoyable reads but the repetitive angst over niece Lucy gets too much for this reader. This time Dr. Scarpetta is too much in touch with her feelings.
3,Dumb Ending...,"After getting tired of plodding though Stephen King I decided to try someone else. Why not try a female author? I read Southern Cross four weeks ago and since that time I've read Body of Evidence, Cause of Death, From Potter's Field, Body Farm, Hornet's Nest,Unnatural Exposure, and Point of Origin (lots of time to read at work). Although the books are rather interesting, I've found that the finale is rushed. In Point of Origin, for example, there is this cheesy James Bond style ending.Cornwell's male characters are mostly jerks or underlings.I enjoy reading the tales of Scarpetta. Please don't bump off Pete Marino."
5,Scarpetta!,This was a great book! Kay Scarpetta is so intense and really knows what she's after. I look forward to reading the next Scarpetta adventure.
3,A very different P.Cornwell story ; not her usual genre.,"From the first couple of pages,this is not what P. Cornwell fans expect. She gets you in her story and graphically weeds you through the plot. I liked reading it, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as others. I couldn't put it down because I had to find out what happens next. Her familiar characters arrive and disappear.There's a thread that takes you from her previous novels and keeps you on the lookout for more.Again, this is not what readers expect from Ms.Cornwell."
3,Too new to this author...,"I had never read a murder mystery in my life until ""Point of Origin""...I heard about Ms. Cornwell in our mailroom one morning and did some investigating and questioned some co-workers. Boom!I bought the book, found it a refreshing change from the facts and figures of my usual business fare and now am finishing ""Body Farm"" which is moving along a little quicker for me...although I hate already knowing the future from ""Point... If you like massive details and some pretty good believable realism, anyone not familiar with the author should be..."
2,Sadness & disappointment via Patricia Cornwell,"I am a very devoted Cornwell, or maybe Kay Scarpetta fan -- I'm not sure as her deviation from the KS format two books ago was so awful. There was no need to kill off Benton -- if Ms. Cornwell is so devoted to KS living a miserable and lifeless existence, please stick to writing the church bulletin. You can do all your preaching there. I don't know if I can bring myself to read another of Ms. Cornwell's books, she took my love for her writing and flushed it down the toilet, with a ""good riddance"" in the process."
3,Not what I expected,"I love Patricia Cornwell's books, especially the Kay Scarpetta novels, but I found this book to be depressing. I wish she would go back to the good hunt and chase books of the past and give Kay and Lucy a better outlook on their careers and lives. With their type of work I know it can get depressing but they always lose in their private lives. I hope she writes more of these books but uses the formula of her previous books like the Body Farm. This book is worth reading but I hope she lightens up in the future."
3,Boring,"What a disappointment to a big fan !! ... It was very slow to get started , and obviously the ending wasleft wide open so we will get to have another book full of Carrie thenext time. Boring!!"
3,"Kay, get a Life!","I agree with all of the reviews. After having read all of PC's books and realizing that some are always going to be better than others, I hope that PC does not fall the way of John Grisham and churn out stories so fast she losses her readership. We still need tight stories, neat plots and some new characters every once in a while. I know you can do it Pat!"
3,Interesting but choppy,"Interesting concept, but choppy and hurried. Although muchtime was spent in describing causes of fires, etc.....how this booksfires were actually ""started"" was not explained... the ""killing"" of so many fine animals did not really seem tied in anywhere. Only took 5 hours to read (which is not good!)."
4,Not her best but better then Hornet's Nest,"I really enjoyed the book, but I was a little disapointed that it was a pretty slow in the begining. The twists that she put into it were a little risky to do, but I think that over all it was a good book to read, esp. if you fallow her books. Definatly recomend."
2,I would hate to work for Kay Scarpetta,"Each book seems to make Dr. Scarpetta a more egotistical, self-centered, difficult person---I would hate to work for the coroner. I found this book rather dull----the crimes lacked pizzazz, characters were left dangling, and it did not hold my interest in the least."
4,Cornwell's winning style comes through again!,"I always hate it when the book ends! Scarpetta finds herself in an unusual situation once again, and manages to keep your attention right up to the last pages. Keep up the good work and keep those novels coming!"
2,"Oh, my, Kay, hates her job...again....","And, argues with Benton and regrets it, again...and whatever Lucy says to her wounds her, again....and Marino is still fat, smoking and drinking and she is worried about him dying, again. This is what happens in this new novel. More of the same old same old. This was not a page turner. I only wanted to finish it because I wanted to see what character Cornwell was going to kill off. But, I actually cheated and read the last chapter. That was it for me. The part about Benton being kidnapped was so sketchy and incomplete. Truthfully, the whole book was sketchy and incomplete. I guess you can tell I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. Cornwell has said she is going to give Kay a rest and work on other projects. Good. Give us a rest. Maybe Kay willl come back as a human being."
2,"Same Old, Same Old...","Patricia Cornwall's same depressing formula is getting very boring. Dr Scarpetti will once again not be allowed a shred of happiness. Her only long term relationship is with her equally long suffering niece. If you've read one, you've basically read them all."
3,"entertaining, but little heart","the usual blood-letting and psychological agony for scarpetta. But, in this novel, i never felt her pain, despite the mountains of it cornwell piles on her, lucy and benton. i bleeped through many of the ""I'm suffering all alone in the limited space of my brilliant mind"" paragraphs to get back to the story, which wasn't her best (but possibly her weirdest). cornwell certainly does a tremendous amount of homework, but the emotional plot points didn't hit me where it hurts. i missed that."
2,Enough already.,"This is my last Patricia Cornwell book, or at least the last""Kay Scarpetta, M.E."" book. Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."
4,good intro to mystery on tape,"I loved this audiocassette and I listened to the UNABRIDGED version. It was slow at first but then, I never wanted it to end. Cornwell has a great way of enticing readers to read her other books by using the reoccuring characters. I love her explicit descriptions. I like how she is not afraid to kill off her main characters. You never know what to expect! I am going right out to buy another Kay Scarpetta novel in the series."
2,Cornwell goes downhill after this Book,"I'm not sure what really made me not like the most. Either the ending or Lucy.The ending reminded me of a soap opera. Someone dies, however he will be resurrected... I just can't get past the ridiculous soap operatic ending. If only Lucy could have been killed too (although, then she would have to be resurrected too).I'm sooooo very weary of Lucy (a.k.a Supergirl) the obnoxious genius has gone from computer wiz kid to a FBI agent, helicopter pilot, undercover drug agent, fire expert & the list keeps growing in future novels. Then having to constantly read about Lucy's lifestyle choice & complications. I don't care if Lucy is a lesbian.I'm also disappoint that the escaped colt that received such big buildup was forgotten. I mean, a bunch of horses die in this fire, but one survives, why?????? Who knows it's never explained.Cornwell's books drastically go downhill after ""Point of Origin"" & if you must continue to read the series, go to the Library."
1,How do I get a refund,"One of the worst books I have ever read. Slow, boring, no contact between the main characters until the unlikely ending."
3,Kay is back to work,"Kay Scarpetta has grown older, wiser, and a little bitter.She's still reeling from her experience with killer Carrie Grethen.Meantime, she's called to investigate a suspected arson at a famous man's home. When a body is pulled from the remains of the building, Kay goes to work."
3,"Compelling, sad book.","I could identify with the lead character, who is aging and becoming somewhat disillusioned with her earlier goals and ideals. (Loved the purse full of Immodium, Tums, Motrin and Aspirin.)This was a compelling read, hard to put down.However, in at least two places, I totally lost the author as to where the characters were located. One moment they were in the morgue and the next, playing Amadeus on the CD. I went back and re-read and concluded that the author just plain neglected to tell the reader that the characters had changed locations. Somewhat irritating, but still an exciting, interesting book."
2,Not good at all,"I was really excited when I bought this book, I was told thatScarpetta was a brilliant charicter and the books were really good. I bought it, I took it home and I tried so hard to get into the book, even half way through I wasn't engrossed. The charicters lacked emotion and the whole book dragged on and on going into to much detail about nothing at all.Some of the pathology was interesting to read about but on the whole this book was very poor."
3,Love and hate for Kay,"While I read this book I had a lot of different feelings forPatricia Cornwells Kay Scarpetta. At last I just thought that I am sick of the dying of all of her friends. Mark, Benton...I couldn't believe his dead, I had to read the pages serveral times until I recognized that Patricia Cornwell is without any feelings for the readers who just liked the love between Kay and Benton, even if they had problems. That was one of the only points in Kays life that was happiness. It was not necessary to destroy it. It does not helpany furhter. The dark side of the books are now dominating, there is nothing left for loving. I am just waiting for the dead of Pete. Why has it to be so? the books are intense, thrilling and facinating but with the bad things and moods dominating they just get on my nerves. I will just stop reading these books. Faye Kellerman, Elizabeth George and other female writers are just more pleasant and as fascinating as Cornwell. good bye...."
2,very disappointing,"Having read all of Ms. Cornwell's books, I found this one very disappointing. Some of the plot is really stretching things, I am getting tired of all these psychos reappearing in subsequent novels, and am getting to dislike Kay Scarpetta more with each novel."
4,PC is getting back on track!!,"This book got me right from the start! A favorite author of mine, but she fell into a slump for a while. This book does have some areas that drag; there are some characters that you wish she would have developed more; there is sadness concerning a main character with whom we have been involved through several book,but all in all it is a page turner and has you hanging on til the very end! As is usual with PC, I hated for this book to end and now can hardly wait for the next one to come out!!"
1,A VERY DEPRESSING BOOK,"I thought the author came across as a very depressed and disturbed person. I have read all of her previous books and really enjoyed most of them. This book had nothing new in it, a lot of rehashing of her earlier plots. The ending was very ho-hum. This is the third boyfriend she has killed off in her books, no wonder she is depressed."
2,I've moved onto other authors now,"I have read all of PC's books in the last couple of months. I really loved them until this last book. I have gotten tired of Lucy, tolerable of Kay at times, frustrated with Marino and adored Benton. I found this last story line hard to follow and there is not really any closure at the ending. I probably will not read any further ones. She has a new book out, I hope she has started a new story line. Kay Scarpetta needs to be retired!!"
5,They just keep getting better!,"This is one of PC's best books. I cried when Benton was murdered by the villians. It shows that there is no such thing as a perfect world. I was hoping that KS and Benton would develop a relationship, but it makes the reader feel the sorrow and anguish that KS and Lucy feel when he dies and how Lucy thinks it's her fault. Pete Marino is a very believable character with real feelings, but he chooses to keep them inside just like most men. I love learning about how the dead can talk to people through the use of the latest modern technology. I personally can't wait for her next novel. Patricia Cornwell makes her characters come alive and jump out at you from the pages of text. Her style is of compassion, fear, hatred, love, taste, touch, and smell. Kay is all these feelings wrapped into one woman. Who among us isn't a little of all these emotions?"
2,NOT ONE OF HER BEST!!!!,"This book was okay, but it moved very, very slow. I didn't like the ending at all. I hope she goes back to her original writing skills (Body Farm, From Potter's Field), because the new way stinks!"
3,Not Cornwall's Best,"While I'm a big Kay Scarpetta fan, I was disapointed in this latest book because of the death of one of the major characters and the overall lack of depth. for example, we never learn what the mystery accelerant was that was capable of creating such devastating fires with such a small fuel load. The ending was too neat, and because of all the unanswered questions about ""how"" the crimes were commited (which to me was always the best part) it's just too obvious that Grethen will return in a future Scarpetta adventure (yawn)."
1,Relentlessly morbid,"I have copies of every book in the Kay Scarpetta series. After Point of Origin, I may donate them all to the local library. What a terrible disappointment!Kay has turned into a grasping, greedy, materialistic bitch. I am unable to enjoy a book whose main character is totally without redeeming qualities. Ms. Cornwell is showing signs of succumbing to the trend towards political correctness--lesbianism, worship of celebrities (Pricess Di, Gianni Versace) who are famous for being famous, etc. Is that why Benton was killed? He was a WASP after all. I guess the graphic horror of his death was the last straw for me. Benton and Pete Marino are the only two ""normal"", admirable characters in the series."
3,A slow starter with a very disappointing ending.,"I first started reading this book about a year ago and just couldn't ""get into it."" It is a very slow starter with a more fast paced conclusion. I have read all Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series and was truly disappointed in Wesley's death. Where will she go from here? Worth a read but not in the same league as some of her earlier novels in the series."
5,Fantastic,Iloved this book. I couldn't put it down. it was so interesting and such a thriller. Iloved pages 23-45 that was the best part and was so so so (I can't describe it )...
3,No question about it--Dr. Kay Scarpetta is unlucky in love!,I have been following the Kay Scarpetta/Benton Wesley romance since day #1. Not exactly the ending that I was hoping for!
2,disappointing,"I don't know why I keep reading Patricia Cornwell's books!...Probably because I started reading from the first Kay Scarpetta book, & you can get hooked. The first Scarpetta books were excellent, the kind of books you read in one sitting. But ""Point of Origin"", in my opinion, was nothing like the other books. The ending depressed me- not that the author had to chose a happy ending. But one of the most interesting characters in the series is now dead...Apart from that, I found it boring that Cornwell uses the same villain over & over again. Even after being disappointed with this book though, I think I'll still read the next one! Old habits are hard to break."
3,"Point of Origin, seemed....... point-less (sorta)","I read this book about a year ago, and it didn't seem to measure up to the Scarpetta series who Cornwell has done so well with. Being a federal agent, I greatly appreciate her insight into our jobs. She has definately studied!! I was mostly impressed with Cornwell's knowledge of arson investigations. She did her homework. I was mostly let down with the story line itself. However, I will, without fail continue to read her novels with enthusiasm. Keep up the good work Ms Cornwell!"
3,another good story...but im SLIGHLY preturbed.,why you ask? well she took away one of the good characters im not saying how or who in case you've never read it..so naturally im peeved...im going to keep reading them of course to see what happens but... i wont enjoy it as much.. the character was good to her series..well life goes on i suppose...any other opinions?i would type more but it would give it away. (^^)
3,"Misery, misery, misery!!!","Just how much more misery can one woman take in life??? This was not the most enjoyable Kay Scarpetta book that I have read. The fire was not fully explained and the ending was too rushed. All loose ends were 'neatly' tied up all in one book - the return of Carrie, the torso murder cases and arson. These could all have been three different books. I just hope that this won't result in a ""She burned in a helicopter crash but she's not really dead"" story with Carrie reappearing in a later book."
1,Another disappointing Cromwell book-what gives?,"I found myself profoundly bored with the amount of time spent agonizing over niece Lucy and her lifestyle choice complications, with Scarpetta's exhaustion and depressions and with a recycled villain. Cromwell's first 3 books were excellent- fascinating, tightly crafted and just plain fun to read. It has been a downhill course since then."
1,a disappointment,"Started off interesting but then bogged down for several hundred pages. From page 300 to the end was excellent but a little too little, a little too late. A sad showing from an excellent author. She wrapped up the ending without tying up loose ends or giving any answers as to why or how. Once you figured out who it was, the novel was over."
1,A truly awful book from a once-good author,"I used to enjoy Patricia Cornwell...her writing was technical but interesting. She used to be able to craft a strong suspense plot and keep you guessing for awhile. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read. The story is rushed, the writing is abysmal (get her to a creative writing class-stat!), and the ending is so absurd that you become angry she takes her readers for such idiots. Don't waste your time or money on this one -- there is nothing of value in it whatsoever."
2,A disapontment in the Scarpetta series.,"When I first discovered the Kay Scarpetta series of books byauthor Patricia Cornwell, I read the first five or so in quicksuccession and eagerly awaited the next in the series to be published. However, the last couple in the series have been real disappointment. I'm glad I waited for the paperback to come out and didn't spend the money up front for a hard cover. The story was predictable. We can't expect the long-suffering Kay to actually be settled or content with life can we? There is just so much personal angst in all of her relationships - with Lucy, Pete, and of course Benton. I never got caught up in the mystery and suspense like I did in the first novels. All of the background writing focuses on Kay and her troubles, not character development of other key players. I'll wait for the paperback of the next in the series if I decide to read it at all."
1,On Patricia Cornwell In General,"I don't know what is worse, being so predictable with a mystery that the reader figures it all out halfway through, or being like Patricia Cornwell and randomly pulling a suspect out of thin air at the very end. Cornwell has great strength with her forensic detail, which I find fascinating, but she's weak at building a novel with suspense and closure. I can ponder on the killer all I want, but in the end I know it will be someone random, perhaps not even previously introduced into the book."
4,"Good book, though not her best work","I've read just about everything of Cornwell's and while this was not her best work, it certainly was good."
2,not as exciting and well written as I had hoped,"This is my first PC book and Ihad heard positive review of her writings from friends. I was not impressed. Although it kept my interest, the ending was a little unbelievable, and came out of left field. It was like ""I have to end this now, so I'll make some wild thing happen to bring it to closure"" I am going to try to read another of her books. This one ""Unnatural Exposure"". If it does not get any better it will be my last."
1,"Disappointing story, too much focus on Kay Scarpetta","Another story where the main character becomes the focus of a killer. What has Patrica done to Kay?. She has changed from a professional to whining and insecure person absorbed in her own feelings. Her attitude to her niece Lucy is hard to understand seeing Lucy is a professional in her own right. Kay thinks of her as a child. It would be so refreshing to read a Kay Scarpetta book in the old style where she solved the crime rather than being the target of it.Time for Kay to take the reins back and get out of the personal. You can do better, Patricia"
1,Irritating. . . frustrating. . . barely tolerable,"Indeed the weakest of the Kay Scarpetta novels -- when did Kay become such a whiner? Predictable story line -- I've figured out the plot by chapter two of each of the last four books; where's the plot twist? the red herring? the surprise? the thrill? I threw the book across the room when I read ""she was stealing their beauty"" in aggrevation. Cornwell's writing used to be edgy and gritty. Now it seems she is more concerned with churning out a book a year rather than being a writer with a good story to tell. Her editor also fails to rise to ocassion -- it's ""ensure"" not ""insure."" As usual, the ending is rushed. The best writing is the goodbye to Benton scene. I want the ""Postmortem"" and ""All That Remains"" caliber back. . . PLEASE!"
2,Disappointing,"After having read all of Cornwells books except the biography of Ruth Graham I found this one puzzeling. As I read it I repeatedly asked myself if it was written by Cornwell or someone else. It simply doesn't have the level of sophistication in the writing, (not the technology) that her previous books have. In addition, there were several glaring typos. I agree with other reviews, it's time to do something totally fresh with Scarpetta."
2,Not up to snuff!,"Disappointed - while still a ""good"" Scarpetta novel,this one seems not as well crafted as its' predecessors. Still wortha look, but I had hoped for better. Lets hope she gets back to her first 3 books quality level before the series becomes stale."
4,"Readable, but predictable Scarpetta","Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner for the Commonwealth ofVirginia, is called in to help investigate a deadly fire which may ormay not have been planned by the apparent victim, or a villian from a previous novel. Joining Scarpetta in her investigation is her usual supporting cast: niece Lucy (now with the ABT), Captain Marino, and her paramour Benton Wesley. The plot is relatively straight forward, as the reader knows that sooner or later the spectre of Carrie Grethen will appear to play a role in the arson/murder cases. Readers should note that a helicopter appears in the author's back cover photograph, and will will play a major role in the plot. The series has lost some of its freshness, but the technical aspects continue to keep a reader's interest to the end."
4,Her best so far,"I've read all of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta books, and this one isby far her best. The plot is good, although I was a littledisappointed in the ending -somehow it seemed a little anti-climactic and possibly unresolved. But overall, I would highly recommend this - it was good, entertaining reading and I couldn't put it down."
3,"A faint image of Scarpetta's earlier tales, commercial plot","A long time fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta, I found myself wondering why I'd not waited for the paperback. Kay is at her best in the autopsy suite or at the scene; too little of that here. Her personal life was always a nice subplot, but was front and center in this work. I found myself occasionally disliking the herione, who seems too good to be true. Lots of political side taking against the FBI; too much of the author's personal history taking over. It is so out of character with previous works, that it seems inconsistant and not plausable. It was a quick read, but not nearly as engrossing as earlier work. I hope Dr. Kay comes back more true to form in the next book, with a more intreging plot, with a few more unexpected twists and turns."
3,Time for a new focus,"I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's books. However, her last 2 books have really been disappointing. Lucy needs to take a job overseas and reappear sometime in the distant future, and Marino needs to get a life. The characters are not new and fresh, but the same ones we are seeing in all of her books. I, for one, did not object to the romance (if you can call it that) with Benton, but this was not allowed to develop.I am really tired of hearing how independent she is so therefore she can't share her life with anyone. Bring Kay back, but definitely give her a new attitude."
1,Not her best work.,"After following this author since the debut of Kay Scarpetta, MD, I have come to the conclusion that her most original work is well in her past. Kay has de-evolved into a navelgazing whiner. Kay use to be a clearsighted seeker of truth, now she is a thin skinnned complainer.If you think that the first paragraph simply says the same things 3 different ways -- and you like that style then you will love this book. If, you, after the second sentance, are saying to yourself, ""get on with it!!"" then don't plunk your money down."
2,Weak in comparison to prior Scarpetta novels,"I admit to reading POO in one sitting, I've read all prior Scarpetta novels and POO is by far the weakest and most frustrating. The one plot twist I COULD'NT accept was the horse farm fire. All those horses with no staff to tend them except the multi-millionaire , I wasn't able to see him cleaning out the stalls and tossing hay and then we are supposed to believe he left the country without anyone to care for his beloved horses. Along with Scarpetta's designer, brand name pretenses and her general negativity I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone other than a Cornwell fan (which I am). I will continue to buy her books with anticipation of new characters, improved plot lines and perhaps even a contented Scarpetta, perhaps Prozac is needed."
3,"Good read, but not up to snuff.","I have always been a fan of PC, and enjoyed all her writings, (except Hornets Nest). But with ""Point of Origin"", many tidbits of Patricia herself have become all too obvious. The coorelations between the author's private life and her works are obvious. First, after Cornwell's unfortunate series of domestic problems with her former FBI husband, Scarpetta now is derisive of the FBI, where in previous works, the FBI vitually walked on water. It is curious also how when Scarpetta discovers an interuterine device in a murder victim, the good doctor proclaims that the victim was ""...obviously sexually active with males"". Huh? The sexual tone here is more Cornwell than Scarpetta.Overall, a great read, and I am looking forward to more of Scarpetta, et al. Also, in the finale, the future appears almost preordained."
2,Disappointing character development,"Apparently, I am not alone in the conclusion that some of the details of the fires were not wrapped up very well. But then, I had a hard time sticking with the plot of the story following the ""horrible personal tragedy"" experienced by Kay and the others. I was incredibly disappointed with that twist and would be very interested to know what Cornwell was thinking when she did this. I believe our friends in the Scarpetta series deserve better than they've gotten in this book.To her credit, Cornwell did answer an unsolved question from a previous plot, and further resolved the issue of a villian who was sure to seek revenge somehow."
3,"Frustrating, Ended suddenly.","I found the book to be considerably less enjoyable than herothers. The characters seemed much less real, overly bitter, and theending leaves many aspects of the Point Of Origin of the fires with too little explanation."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I am extremely disappointed in this book. Plot points are not resolved. Villans are recycled. Cornwell kills off one of the her most attractive, appealing characters. She seems to be setting Marino up to die, and Lucy for a breakdown. The conclusion is so open-ended, I'm sure we'll see the same villanous characters again."
5,Canada north,This is another wonderful book written by my favorite author---all of the books he has written are superb---I always look forward to a new one
4,Wonderful Health Tool For All,"This is the most effective home health system I have ever seen: you can set and meet almost any mind/body goal using this system and even kids can use it effectively, with proper instruction. The only pitfall of this book is that you need to take a class to be able to use the book effectively! The chatty writing style obscures the simple procedures that make Touch For Health so easy to use.The quantity of information is astounding...The food testing information alone is worth the price of the book!But I definitely recommend finding a class or writing to the author to get a handle on how to use the book. It's absolutely worth the time and effort: I've saved a lot of money on medical bills by maintaining my health with Touch For Health."
1,Touch for Health,"I do not know much about the book because the seller did not deliver it to me. There was a mess up at the post office and some reason the book was returned to the seller. They did not try to contact me and they charged me a restocking fee. I wanted the book but I will never buy from that seller again. Not real pleased with the whole Amazon stuff, they did not try to help either. BAD DEAL... I do not think that this will happen again. I will just go to Booksamillion and get my books from now on.I think that the book would be a great help for those who Love Horses... if the book ever arrives."
1,Touch For Health,I want to buy the Used Tough For Health and have found no way to do that. I could have gone to the store and bought a new one for the amount of time I have spent trying to buy this used edition. Lists and lists of things to buy....no button that says BUY...I WANT TO BUY....GET SIMPLE PLEASE. Saw the new one and notice a used book....just let me buy it if you have it.Can not review what I can not buy.....
3,Mediocre at best,"Being into pretty much any type of metal (aside from the God-awful rap-rock/nu-metal scene that's going on at the moment) the name Kreator was bound to have popped up a few times. I saw this compilation in passing (I wasn't specifically looking for it) and thought why not, since I'd heard praise of the band and I've taken gambles before and they've payed off. Unfortunately, I feel I've wasted my money.Every song sounds pretty much the same. They have annoying vocals (either growl or sing, don't do some half-assed excuse for either), pretty standard musicians and they're amatuerish song-writing leaves a lot to be desired. If you want death, listen to Morbid Angel or Cryptopsy. If you want thrash, stick with Metallica and Anthrax. If want a mixture of the two then Sepultura or Slayer will do nicely. Quite frankly, this just an average, unexciting romp through the cliches of how non-metallers view metal and I'd recommend that you don't bother with it."
5,I want more!,The performances on this DVD are of such high quality that I wish full sets were available from the festival instead of representative numbers. I wonder how much extra footage might be on someone's cutting room floor...
2,Inconsistant quality,"When I first got this scanner it was great, I loved the size and the color handeling was pretty much spot on. However, only 6 months in, it has developed a light area where it scanns color images lighter down the side than over the rest of the scan bed. This has come to be unacceptable in some highly critical scans. As much as I would like to love this scanner, I would not buy one again or recommend one - unfortuante."
3,It does not come with Silverfast SE/AI 6.0,"I got my order 2 days ago. When I open the box and take a look, the software bundle DOES NOT INCLUDE LaserSoft Silverfast SE.It only come with Microtek ScanWizard. However,it seems, the Microtek ScanWizard is usable. I scan a 4""x5"" negative and it seems to work ok, I think that I need to play with the scanning software some more to see if I can get it right.I will submit my detail review later on..."
1,The Rubbermaid 1181 is a discontinued product,"The Rubbermaid 1181 is a discontinued product and at least Uncle Joe's admits that's not what they are offering (see their comments under ""Featured Merchants""). Presents for you makes no disclaimer but shipped a 1182 which has the drain on the opposite side and as the previous reviewer noted is not a suitable substitution. In either case, false product advertising.Avoid! 0 stars."
3,"Not perfect, but leak is slower","Got this for my wheel barrow. I thought it worked perfectly, but after 2 weeks, tire was low again. I hope the full size bottles for my car tires work better if ever needed."
2,Ultramagnetic's DJ goes gangsta...not sure that's all good,"Looking for D.J. MOE LOVE to give you that old ULTRAMAGNETIC feeling,guess again. Now,writing this review again (somehow got erased). D.J. MOE LOVE doesn't get help from KOOL KEITH,CED-GEE and never again T.R. LOVE. He goes with outsiders,probably from his Brooklyn Fort Greene Projects neighborhood.Released on KUTMASTA KURT's Threshold Recordings,this EP is not bad,production wise. All songs are clean (to be gangsta) but the good thing is D.J. MOE LOVE has instrumentals for 4 out of 5 songs here. So if you ain't down with the gangsta,the music and production works well. ""More Of The Raw"" and ""Talk Of The Town"" are great selections. All the instrumental tracks make this worth listening to (for a while)."
5,Favorite Book!,I picked up this book in middle school at a RIF book swap and I have read it at least every year since! Going on almost 10 years now! I would recommend this book to anyone!
5,Up Country is such a wonderful book!,"^^ I really would... I mean, the thoughts and feeling are so real and thought out to what a real sixteen-year-old boy in that situation of having and alcholic/protisute mother... I can really relate to how he's acting and feeling... I would tell anybody to add this book to their collection!!!! :)"
5,Good book,"I think that this book is the best book I've ever read, and each time I read it I get the same feeling over again."
1,"Great product, bad company to purchase it from!","That is a fantastic product! I have used it many times before. It has the highest natural aspirin content of any white willow Ive come across before. However, this seller took way to long to send it to me, and when it arrived, the product expired in less then 1 week! I could not be more upset about spending money and waiting on an expired product!"
4,Not a Bad Movie,"I know critics and fair share of movie fans didn't like this movie. I don't think it was bad in my opinion. I find if you are a person who loves your art cinema, you will excuse most of the inconsistent plotting and find a lot the subject matter related to the art world and its artists quite relateable. The acting is enjoyable and made the plot work despite its choppiness. All in all, I believe the movie worked thanks to actors involved and the art gallery finale had alot of a life imitating art that saved the flim."
1,Boogie Woogie cd,This product is defective. It gets stuck many times and is in very bad shape.I am very unhappy with this purchase. I would like to have a product that works as was advertised. How can I even consider ordering another cd under these circumstances.I emailed the Co but so far no reply.Thanks Alan
5,Boogie Woogie,AS USUALLY GILLIAN ANDERSON IS AMAZINGLY FUNNY AND QUIRKY IN THIS WONDERFUL COMEDY THAT SHOW THE DARKSIDE OF THE ART WORLD. SINCE THERE IS ALWAYS A GOOD AND BAD SIDE TO EVERYTHINGS. IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT IT CAN BE DONE WITH CLASS AND HUMOR IT'S A GREAT FILM AS ALWAYS. THE CAST WAS AMAZING IN IT AS WELL. I MAY BE A BIT BAISED SINCE I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED EVERYTHING THAT GILLIAN ANDERSON DOES. BUT TRUST ME IT IS A MUST SEE.
1,Attempted Rip-Off Warning - Do Not Confuse This With Boogie Nights,"Boogie Woogie's US release was in one theatre for one week. Its total domestic gross was $2,618. There are no critic reviews available on Metacritic.Its total foreign gross was $44,909. It's logo is an imitation of the logo for the successful and superior Boogie Nights. Don't get ripped off."
1,Time S#itters,"I put this junk right back for sale on Amazon, after I beat it today. Who knows? maybe I'm old now, to me the humor was dried out. The graphics sucked, even with my PS2 component cable. The music was weird and giant foot steps near the end of the game were iritating, as well as some alarms. Everybody whom played this game know those two computers are stupid hard to link up unessesarily. ""I know I can't spell, but I'm leaven it like that"". One thing I liked alot though, was you can customize the controller, but the engineers make you change weapons too much, AND even take your weapons after the missions. I felt like throwin' this game in the toilet."
1,Sooooo OVERRATED,"If the only shooter you've ever played is the oringinal ""Doom"" or ""Duke Nuke 'Em"", or if you're under 12 years old, then you'll probably like this game.If, however, you've ever played Black, SOCOM, Everything Or Nothing, Cold Winter, Splinter Cell, Max Payne, Syphon Filter (including the PS1 Syphon Filter), Red Faction, or any other decent shooter, then you'll be bored out of you mind like I was. This game is cartoonish and has a distinct arcade-game feel to it. Every 20 seconds someone is telling you which way to go. Kills are very unsatisfying and weapons lack that visceral feel that you get in the games listed above.Don't be foold: although some of the designers behind Golden Eye created this game, Future Perfect is not even close to Golden Eye."
2,Broke the CD into bits,"when I first started playing this game I was really happy with it. It had a lot of character to it, and a lot of humor as well. Good gameplay and variety of situations. Quite a bit of imagination went into this game. But I got to tell ya this is the first time I've ever took the CD out and smashed it to pieces. It was a level where you had to decode 3 different computers and after trying to get this sequence 15-20 times, I had enough. I just smashed the freakin Cd, and it felt mighty good to do it. Whoever made the game knew that this particular level was a pain in the but and i think that they took great pride in making the gamer's life so difficult. Why can't they just make a game that isn't pretentious. Just good gaming situations and a lot of fun. This game has really deterred me from buying another game. Maybe I'm just getting to old for this s*&#."
4,good game,"The fast gameplay is well-appreciated. I love fighting the robots, especially. The amount of weapons you have in this game is staggering. I love the fact that the game isn't too easy or too hard. It's a perfect challenge. You have to buy this game if you own a Playstation 2."
4,It's time to Split!.................,"Time Splitter's Future Perfect, the 3rd installmentto the Time Splitters series, is a unique FPS.I Love Time Splitters 2, and I was equally happy with TSFP.However, there were some beef's I had with it.Pro's:Over 100 unlockable characters,Frantic multiplayer mode,and my personal favorite, Arcade mode.Map Maker is very well done, however confusing at times.Con's:WAY too short,the story has a VERY scripted feel to it.TSFP has a very ""Enclosed"" feel to it.I myself, like a more free-roaming environment.I'm also a big fan of Goldeneye 64, and if you have played it,you'll know what I'm talking about.Overall I would suggest buying this game ONLY if you've playedthe other Timesplitters.For first time players, I would suggest renting it."
4,Side-splitting,"Timesplitters Future Perfect is the best game out of the Timesplitters series and is now made by EA games instead of Eidos. After three long years, one of the best first-person shooter games finally returns in its biggest installment yet.Cortez is back and this time he must stop the evil Jacob Crow from destroying the future. Along the way, Cortez gets some help from his future self; his future self travels back through time and helps you defeat some tough enimies. It seems that Timesplitters was never good in the story section but it makes up for it in the arcade section.The arcade section has always been one of the best elements of the Timesplitters games; it basically provides hours of endless gameplay and offers over one-hundred fifty characters to choose from from a monkey to a sock creature and even a dead cow. There aren't any new elements to the arcade mode; it's just like the one from the previous game.Well, that's all there is to this game and I'd recommend it."
4,Time Splitters Future Perfect,This game is awesome the graphics are good and the controls are easy. The characters are unique and so are the levels. Here are the downfalls:some things just dont make sense (harry tipper for example) but seriously though when im running w/ a bag in one hand and a shot gun in the other and somehow the gun pumps itself thats something the company needs to work on. Another thing some of the arcade league is WAY to hard same with the chalanges yes i no they're called CHALLENGES for a reason but i want to unlock people and i cant because its to hard. Also when you get armor it should show you with a bulletproof vest on i think that would be cool.In all i love this game but there are to few arcade levels making it boring after an hour of play. But if you need a shooting game with LOTS of FREAKS this game is for you (i no it was the right game for me).
5,BEST FPS EVER!!!!!!!,"Let me just say I have played both other timesplitters game and they rock. They were made by Free Radical an Eidios. Now its made by Free Radical an EA.All I have to say is kudos to EA for going above and beyond on the new timesplitters game. The controls are phenominal.The weapon designs are better than ever as well as the character designs.I'll start off with the cons.CONS:-Too many characters to start off with.-Too many characters from Timesplitters2PROS:-Blood(not sickening though)-weapon designs-You can see your characters hands(finally!)-Level designs-Chinese level(best level in the trilogy)-controls-Multiplayer-Length of campaign(not too long,not too short)-4 different monkeys(ninja,regular,zombie,cyborg)-Graphics(more realistic)This is a fantastic game for your collection.Not recommended for kids though."
2,A Cliché that will live in infamy,"Two brave men.Best friends from childhood share everything, including the love of one woman. Oh, yea and their is something about the Japanese too. But who really cares about that ? Not the book.If this is the big blockbuster of the summer I think that we can all save eight dollars and just got rent some ""B"" flick from the thirties and forties."
3,enjoyed it guiltily,"Why do I say I enjoyed the book guiltily? Well, cos' I went to watch the movie and I loved it, I guess i must be a hopeless romantic. But I stiil had to agree about the superficial aspects of the storyline. The war scenes were good but somehow reviews had taught me to beware of the love scenes. Ya right, I honestly liked that crap and that's why I feel guilty. But nevertheless read it only if you are a hopeless romantic like me. Really. don't bother wasting your time to read it and slam the book so disgustingly and give it 1 star and drag the whole rating down because there are still some people who swear by the book."
3,Mmm..,"I enjoyed the movie, Pearl Harbor, and expected to find the book just as entertaining. Randall Wallace's imagination is amazing, but way the words were written and formed brought down my overall liking for the book. Pearl Harbor had a wonderful plot and story, but would've been far better if not for the lack of vocabulary and word usage."
2,obviously missed 30 seconds over tokyo,"Would have been a good book if author had merely seen one of my favorite movies ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo""."
5,A Prosecutor's Inside Story of of His Trial to Stop the Klan,"If you want true legal drama at its best, with insights into the inner workings of the Klan and the prosecutor who challenged it, this book will fascinate and captivate. First Amendment issues are eloquently presented by both sides. In this case, the Klan's freedom of speech is contrasted with a community's right to be free from fear. But can any one man perservere against an unwilling legal system and the most notorious terrorist groups in America?"
2,Not Impressed,"It's fine that they wanted to continue the story after the TV series was canceled, but I don't think they should've done it without the original actors. It's bad enough to change minor characters, but they had to change Christy herself. She's obviously the main one so they should've stayed with Kelly Martin. If she was unavailable, they should have just let it go."
1,NOT Christy,"For fans of the original Christy series, this is NOT the ending. The movie is TOTALLY wrong. First of all, the main characters are completely different actors(except for the doctor) and they don't do a good job of their parts. The setting is all wrong too, it's so obviously not the real mission house and school. The story is wrong as well. The series left it open as to who Christy marries(we know that the original ""Christy"", Catherine Marshall's mother, married a preacher). This movie, though, has her marry the doctor. That spoiled everything! Plus, the acting is cheap. The beautiful scenery and music, the quality acting, the genuineness of all the people of Cutter Gap is missing. If you are a fan of the original Christy series, STAY AWAY FROM THIS!"
2,at least she marries the right one...,"This mini-series takes advantage of the fans' interest in the love triangle. Two different endings were shot, so that not even the actors knew who Christy would choose. Unfortunately, this decision to keep the viewer guessing until the final scene makes Christy looks like a flake. By the time this soap opera ended, I didn't care about Christy's fate; I was feeling too sorry for both the men in her life. Catherine Marshall's characters deserve better. Stewart Finlay McLennan is excellent as Neil; I wish he had an experienced actress playing Christy and a script worthy of his talent."
2,She chooses the wrong man!!,"Geez, What is this? Marrying a girl 30 years your junior. Give me a break.Christy obviously needs someone to knock some sense into her head. Why doesn't she choose the preacher/fiance'. The one she chose is soooo old. Makes no sense. I have the other 2 dvd's as well and watched them both before this one in order to keep the theme intact but am very disappointed. I was so looking forward to her and David being to gether but obviously it's not to be.There is absolutely no chemistry between Christy and her father figure. I think I would rather go back to my favorite ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Avonlea"" at least she came to her senses and chose one that she could grow with instead of the May/December (Old man wanting young inexperienced lady) relationship. Oh well....."
3,can't compare to the original tv series,"I too enjoyed the tv series ""Christy"" and was very disappointed with these movies. I know Kellie Martin said she didn't take the role because when she finishes a role, ""she moves on"", but I find that selfish and truly wished all the original cast had finished what they started for us ""Christy"" fans. Although the actors tried their best to follow along with the personality of their character, it still couldn't compare to the original roles. I also felt the new movies were not in keeping with the reality of the setting in the original series. The people looked too clean to be from cutter gap and many of the children sported haircuts you would see today. The cabins changed dramatically from the older series to the new movies. Too much change. The only reason I would get this movie would be to put closure on the series. I felt it took too much work on my part to ""overlook"" the new actors and settings just to get through the movie."
1,Not Very Good...,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews on here, these movies were not very good. It actually hurt to watch them. The actors who relaced Fairlight, David, and Miss Alice are just not very good at all. I REALLY wish I would not have bought them. Stuart Finlay-McLennan is the ONLY reason that I bought these, to see how the love story ended. I should have stuck with the book, which the ending is enough for me now."
2,Sort of Disappointing!,I really liked the TV show and was disappointed when Pax stopped showing it and was happy when I read that they were making new movies and I tried to watch this movie but just couldn't get into it and was really bored but maybe I will try and watch it again sometime and maybe it will grow on me!
4,A great ending,"I do love this DVD. It gives you the ending you always craved, both from the books and the TV series.I do agree that Lauren was not the best Christy, but the replacements for David and Miss Alice were good for their parts.The one scene missing is the acceptance of a certain proposal. I really would have liked to have seen that filmed.Otherwise, it is a great film that you can watch with the whole family."
1,I know Christy and she's no Christy . . . .,"To be blunt, Laura Lee Smith's Christy is petulant and immature. I like Diane Ladd as an actress, but her portrayal of Alice Henderson is bland.Thumbs up to the men -- Stewart Finaly-McLennan and James Waterson. Also, Dale Dickey did a great job with the role of Opal McHone and I thought Emily Perkins and Olivia Kelly were outstanding as Zady Spencer and Ruby Mae (respectively.The script could have provided a much better transitions in several place. Most notably, we see the good-by to one beau. It would have been more emotionally satisfying to see her say ""YES!"" to the other.While some performances were excellent, the movie must stand on the overall performance of the cast, director and screenwriters. With Christy and Alice being so central to the story, it simply doesn't make it.We all knew who she would end up with, anyway, didn't we??? Much better to go back and watch the CBS series or better yet, read the book!"
3,A New Beginning,"It was hard to make the adjustment and transition from the original cast, particularly the Fairlight character was not the same warm understanding person from the original TV show or from the book. This would be more enjoyable to those who aren't familiar with the TV series."
2,Christy-A new Beginning,"As a christian movie, I think they should always be honest & truthful. Christy(who was actually Catherine Marshall's mother, Leonora Whitaker Wood)DID NOT MARRY THE DOCTOR,SHE MARRIED THE PREACHER,JOHN WOOD! I found this out by reading Catherine's book, ""MEETING GOD AT EVERY TURN"". I know they probably bought the rights to the movie, but still shouldn't they have been truthful?"
2,Divers Typos,The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon. The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop. If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere.
5,Great F/X CD at a great price,"This is not the best overall sound f/x CD out there, but you do get an array of sound effects that will fit into any horror film project you are working on. Don't spend a lot money on those other ""Halloween F/X"" CD's (I've tried them all), this one does the job."
5,Really cute!!!!,My daughter got a set of these dolls when she was 3 1/2 and lost them at a friend's. She was so devastated that we had to buy them again for her 4th birthday. The dolls are darling and an easy size to play with. They do have a few small accessories if you're child eats toys.
3,Fairytopia Petal Princesses are Cute,"The Fairytopia dolls in this series are extremely cute. The wings seem like they would get damaged easily so a little girl would need to handle the toy carefully in order for them to look ""pretty""."
5,Accurate and Readable,"This thermometer is accurate and durable. The clip is designed to hang from a wire rack, but also keeps the instrument from rolling over on a glass shelf. It's pretty readable even with bifocals and looks like it will last forever."
4,This book has it all!,"If you are looking for some ideas for exercises you can do easily around the house, than look no further! This book shows you how to do exercises for every body part. I also like reading about what exercises the celebrities she trains enjoy. The reason for only 4 stars and not 5 is because I would have liked it to have an actual program written out using all of the exercises she lists."
5,Tips for the REAL WORLD,"This book is packed full of exercises you can sneak in here and there. The card trick is amazing! Also, a section dedicated to helping a certain body part is super helpful. The wire binding is a necessity for a workout book--you can place it flat on the floor or counter when going through exercises. VERY happy with this purchase--have had it for quite a while."
4,Well laid out book,"I found Kaehler's book to be a great overall fitness book and fairly motivating. She gives good logical advice and doesn't accept reasons for not exersizing. The thing that drives me the ""craziest"" about the book is the name-dropping. I believe she overuses the names of her clients and generally pumps her status up a bit. Other than that it's a good buy. Visually interesting, good clean examples and great techniques. Worth the $. Good luck! T. Heerwig"
4,"Ordinary Items, Extraordinary Results","Kathy Kaehler makes staying in shape practical...not fun...but practical. Use ordinary household items to turn your soft body hard. At times it reads a bit like the Star or Enquirer's guide to fitness, but having said this...it works. Besides, selling yourself on the idea of a consistent excercise routine, is the first step to a beautiful hard body. So Michelle smoked and Schiffer couldn't do three push-ups, we still want to look like them, so we read the book and get results. This book is worth every penny. In fact, I would have given it five stars, but felt this was unethical as I haven't read this book, but I plan to next Wednesday. Good Luck and all the best to you aspiring excercisers...julia young."
4,If You Love MAD This is for You,"You have to be a MAD follower, as I am to download these magazines. Lots of fun, with the usual gang of idiots. Glad I was able to get this on my Kindle. Some of the panels are a little hard to read until I figured out how to enlarge. I will purchase more."
2,disapointment,"stoked to see graphic novels introduced to the Fire - which is an incredible machine. honestly it just doesn't work esp. in B&W. would prefer to return if i could. checked out watchmen to see a comparison for fairness - something less text intensive, modern. just not for the kindle. sorry, my only let down to date."
4,Another Fine Stax Re-release,"The Soul Children's CHRONICLE CD is a re-release of a 1979 Stax LP. As such it has the strengths and weaknesses of most of the Stax LP's of the time. The main (and actually, the only) weakness on CHRONICLE is that, in my opinion, many of the songs are average at best. Stax Records routinely made LPs this way, mixing in great songs, many of them hits, with filler.But this CD also showcases the best of Stax. The great arrangements, outstanding backup musicians featuring some beautiful work by the unbelievable Steve Cropper, and the Soul Children's simply gorgeous vocals make CHRONICLE well worth owning, even if you only listen to some of the songs."
3,Classic Carlin - but overdoses of repetition,"I was excited by the promise of this set - hell who would not at the prospect of 4 -5 hours of Carlin?Carlin has wonderful timing and a wicked and wacky grin that precedes anyone of his reflections on the absurdity of the human condition that he delivers with a complete mastery of American idiom.This is a collection that is hard to ignore for a die-hard fan like me - but suffers from repetition of many of his classic pieces - like ""Words they won""t let you say on TV"" to ""Stuff"" especially since his delivery of his masterworks does not vary greatly from one performance to the other. The editors must have been sleeping.But if you have the cash, splurge."
4,George Carlin Collection,"A very good show that always hit home for some, as it is racy in parts, good adult entertainment."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"REPETITIVE FOOTAGE. VERY DRY. I AM A HUGE FAN OF CARLIN, BUT THIS COLLECTION IS NOT WORTH OWNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY......."
2,Very disappointing for a fan,"Ever since seeing his 90's work I've been a fan, so it was with great hopes that I unpacked this collection. After viewing the first DVD I was thinking that he has really improved since that and hoped for the next discs to be better.Unfortunately, it turns out that they all contain pretty much the same jokes and even the George Carlin favourites is mostly a rehash of the previous three discs. I have a feeling that this will never leave my bookshelf again. My advice? Stay with the more recent material..."
5,Simply the funniest man alive!,"George Carlin is a realist. He finds the facts of life that may offend people but his reasoning all makes sense in a witty way. Weather you are smart or dumb, you will die laughing."
2,Good Premise,"Overall I must say this was a wierd movie. Now I saw the description on the guide and it said it was twisted. So, ok I like twisted. Well the twisted part was ok, but the film making was awful. I think this would make for a real good movie in the right hands."
4,A nice easy read containing practical tips to boost your career,"A good book with some very practical advise on how to succeed as a manager,but also how to deal with issues in everyday life. I think the managerial aspect of this book means it is more for those who already find themselves in lower management and want to move up the corporate ladder.I appreciated the insight into life of the Author and the tips, quotes and ""remember this"" at the end of each chapter are well worth making note of.Time will tell if it will get me a promotion ;-)"
5,Great,"Finally a book that explains how to make your way up the corporate ladder. Finally after 12 years in the ""real world"" after receiving my MBA a clear concise book that explains the do's and don'ts of corporate America. The anecdotes add a touch of humor and help in remembering the lessons. Socrates and Aristotle would be proud. Great Book I would recommend it to all."
1,"Oven, not a toaster","I am sure it works fine as an oven, but it really sucks as a toaster. There are only two heating wires on top and on bottom, which are at the very back and front. Because of the gigantic size of the unit, the elements end up too far from the item being toasted. The end result is that some items (tortillas for example) get baked (and totally dried out), rather than toasted."
2,"Good oven, lousy toaster","This toaster oven makes the worst toast I have ever had. It dehydrates the bread without actually browning it, except for the one burnt edge I get on every piece of toast. I burn my hands every day because I have to flip the bread over to get remotely even ""toasting,"" i.e. so one side isn't totally dry and the other side soggy. I end up with a hard, dry piece of bread. The control knobs are very counterintuitive and hard to read. Works fine as an oven, but if you like toast, as I do, buy something else."
1,What's going on???!!!,"2 toaster ovens were ordered. Both arrived on the same day. One is fine. The other was missing parts. Distributor arranged for FEDEX to pick up toaster oven in question with asurance that a new toaster oven would be shipped. I'm still waiting to receive the 2nd toaster oven(one month after original delivery)! ""What's going on???!!!"""
3,"Heats quick & is roomy, however..","I had to part with my Black & Decker after 7 yrs because it's heating element would not shut off properly. I was glad to get a larger oven in the Hamilton Beach family as I believed it's reputation, specs. & accessories would meet & even exceed my requirements for a toaster oven. I have to say I am very disappointed. The unit gets too hot on the outside, it needs a second rack (for convience), the timer is an antique style that you can't adjust without feeling like you're breaking it, it burns toast on the bottom if you don't move the rack up, and doesn't turn off if the kids open the door in the middle of it's toasting cycle like my old one would(nice safety feature). I will be writting to the comp. in hopes they will improve on what could be a great item."
3,not worth the money,"I use a toaster oven almost daily, and often times several times a day. I normally have to replace mine every 3 yrs or so. This Toaster over did not last 2 yrs and never really did work well from the start. I did like the larger size of the oven and the larger toaster over tray, but I really don't have anything else good to say about this product. I have bought better toaster overs at Walmart for 20 bucks. On the up side...it really does LOOK good...it just doesn't work all that great."
2,Not bad - then caught on fire!,"Had this toaster oven for over a year. Was toasting a bagel today and the circuitry area caught on fire extremely quickly today. Bye bye toaster oven. The fire was visible inside the right hand side of the toaster, and quickly went out after I unplugged it. Trash."
2,"Uneven heating, loud, didn't last",Part of the burning elements do not heat up causing most food to heat unevenly. The fan is quite loud and the product did not last a year.Would no recommend.
3,"good for baking, slow for toasting","This is a great product for baking, but not the best for all your toasting needs. You see, if you like melted cheese on toast in the morning (like I do), then you find yourself in a bit of a quandry with this product - you want to use the included tray so the cheese drips into there and is easier to clean, but that increases the time to toast and decreases the average crunchiness (because the bottom heat source is blocked by the tray). Anyway, I shifted my pattern to toast right in there with no tray, and just deal with the cheese that drips to the crumb catcher on the bottom. That does slide out for easy cleaning, but is slightly more annoying to deal with than the tray.Another note - it's very easy to leave this toaster on (in oven mode)!"
2,Book review,"I didn't particularly enjoy the book because none of the characters were likeable and the whole thing was depressing. It is written well, however."
3,"Great production, not so great album.","I picked this album up the day it was released because I enjoyed the single and have always enjoyed Tom Delonge's melodies. I have to say that I was a little disapointed. To me the album seemed forced. Some of the songs sounded like Delonge was trying to prove that he is passed the juvenile ways of Blink 182. The songs do all sound the same and the melody of the single, ""the Adventure"", made it's way onto many of the other songs as well. With all this said, the album is enjoyable. The production is big and mood setting. Many people will enjoy this album, but don't expect the epic adventure promised from the hype."
3,How could you not like this cd?,"I actually didn't realize that Angels and Airwaves was a spin off of blink until a few years later. Anyways, i listened to this cd a while back, and I thought most of this album was pretty good. My favorite track to listen to was the adventure. And I also really like valkyer missle as well. I thought Tom had a cool concept and great ideas and they really worked well for him. My favorite song Everything's Magic is not on this cd. I will say that any fan of current top 40 radio will love this cd, or any fans of blink will really like this as well. I would def. recommend this cd."
5,"Outstanding music, lyrics, and atmospherics","Musical innovation at its best. Count me as one of the many new AvA fans. AvA has a distinct sound that's all their own--and it's good stuff! Tom's voice is one of a kind and his lyrical ability is one of the best. Unlike Blink, AvA's lyrics are mature, optimistic, and uplifting--this is very refreshing and one of reasons I like their music so much. There is ""real""-ness and grit to the lyrics, but without the contrived angst that permeates so much modern rock. Put simply, the music makes you feel good and I imagine that it's cathartic for Tom to be able to express his true voice unabashedly in ways he's never been able to do before."
3,so-so,"For all the blink fans out there. Since Blink is broken up and you want to hear more music from them them. I dont recomend this one unless you are die-hard fan of Blink. I myself was dissapointed when it came out. The lead single is The Adventure, that song is the best one on their. The music is quite different from the blink albums. Tom has defintely matured on his sound and failed to live up to his word when he said it was going to change the face of rock and roll. I recommend the group Mark and Travis formed, it's called plus 44"
4,Lives up to Tom's hype...almost.,"I'd like to give it 3.75 stars out of 5, but since that is not an option I rounded up to 4. YOU'RE WELCOME AvA.I was pleasantly surprised by this album and I think if you give it a few listens you'll see why. Upon first listen it was ok-good, but it does get better the more you hear it. I don't know why that makes sense, but it does.The first single, The Adventure, was a perfect choice to launch this album. It's addicting without being annoying. Other standouts are Do It For Me Now, A Little's Enough, and The Gift. I'm not a big fan of Distraction however because it gets a little too repetitive.I wasn't expecting to like this album as much as I do. It is definitely worth a listen or two. If you like Boxcar Racer, I think you'll enjoy this one."
1,Bring on the suck,"Musically, I thought these guys were pretty good....and then someone started to sing, straight in the trash. Unoriginal voice = not interested, NEXT!"
4,pretty good,This cd is pretty good. It could have been better if more of the songs sounded like the adventure. The adventure is definetly the best song on the album but Valkyrie Missle is pretty good to. All in All its a pretty good album
2,No it isn't,"Here it is, the great AVA album that Tom DeLonge has been building up as some of the best music to come out in over 20 years. I assure you this is false information.What i hear in this album is the failed Box Car Racer, minus its garage sound charm. Tom has made no efforts to change anything about the face of music, but instead has written 10 lengthy and repetetive standard emo anthems. And they arent even catchy at that.I think the problem with the fact that this album is getting so many positive reviews is that people WANT to think that Tom was right. People desperatly want to believe that they are listening to deep, insightfull, new music. But i assure you, none of this is new, none of this is deep. This is a major dissapointment.Tom DeLonge said that Angels and Airwaves is going to change the face of modern rock and roll... finally i understand the title of Mark Hoppus' newest projects first release... no it isn't."
3,Scooter McGavin from page 1 is a tool,"Scooter, U2's early=good. The new stuff blows. Bono is the biggest tool in the world because he really thinks he WILL, not try, but WILL save the world. I have no clue how you compare Angels and Airwaves with being U2 rip offs. If I could use the other word for tool, i would Mr. McFaggin.On to the cd. The cd is just OK which doesn't surprise me at all. The songs are similar in the way they sound and Tom's voice sounds real raw like it did in the early days of Blink 182 on some of the songs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. All in all, ya sure, its worth the $10 i paid for it. Make sure you check out the other reviews and read what Scooter McGavin has to say about the cd. His review is either on the first page or second.Final review. CD is average with good and bad songs. 3 stars."
2,uh........,"well, lets see. It seems they lured us in with The Adventure promising a more advanced ""Boxcar"". They came close with maybe 3 songs. The rest? It turned out to be one of those CDs you chuck out the window. bumber."
2,A very big let down,This is just way too contrived and glossed over for me. The minute you start saying the name of your band in the song (more than one time none the less) it can never be a good thing. Almost every song sounds like the one before it. I am guessing the band thinks they made an album that sounds much different than anything else...not so much. What they did was make an album that does nothing groundbreaking or exciting. I expected much more from guys like this. I would not recommend buying this CD and I wish I could return it.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This album is almost as bad as Courtney Love's America's Sweetheart. All of the songs sound the exact same, they sample the beats of The Adventure. They even have the same lyrical structure and tune as The Adventure. I consider myself an old school Blink182 fan, Box Car Racer fan, and even more a fan of The Distillers. I anxiously awaited this release from one of 90s punk's guitar greats, and was greatly dissappointed. I am not trying to get a refund on this cd. So far no such luck."
4,Great CD,"Go get this CD. Tom, David, Ryan, and Atom did a great job piecing this together and obviously took their time in doing so. The album has the melodic rock appeal of U2, the uplifting vocal cords of Blink-182, and the overall reverberation of something new and above all of that. Fans of U2 and Blink-182 may be taken aback a bit at first, but in all honestly this is an album that warrants everyones ears. It's peaceful, energetic, and comes with an eye opening message about the effects of war. The music comes as something new and different, yet somehow familiar and great. Its refreshing to hear bands like this take a more mature direction. It opens the door up to innovative paths towards better music."
2,one big problem with this cd is...,"is not how the beats sound. every track has a new and refreshing beat to it, nice twists, makes for a great sound! however, when Tom starts to sing each song, it all starts sounding exactly the same. it's like a whole album of one song. it was very hard for me to distinguish one song from another cause of Tom's voice. they needed someone else to come in at some point. it's nothing like Blink 182 or +44 and I give them props for trying something new. after a few listens u can sorta tell the difference but it doesn't make them good tracks. I like 4 of the 10 songs now which is why it gets 2 starts! however, I don't think this is worth your money. +44 has a much better sound and the songs are more catchy and you can immediately tell the difference between one song and another! so I would advise you to get their album over Angels & Airwaves. though I still do admire Tom's efforts, it just doesn't work."
2,influenced by...Rush? Maybe just a little...,"I heard ""The Adventure"" and really liked it. I can't really say the same for the rest of the CD. A lot of people seem to love it and that's great; I'm just not one of those people. In my opinion, the songs all sound the same, and with the exception of ""The Adventure"" just aren't very good. It sounds like some kind of futuristic, progressive sounding experiment in music and I think it would have been better if it was just more rock. However, I would have settled for it just being more...good."
4,"All that delay, Tom!","Shoot me, but gosh, this album would be great if only someone else was singing. It's like Tom is in the wrong band or something...a band who's in love with late 80s The Edge-mega-delay. His voice just so, so does not fit the music...that iconic voice that unfortunately popularized the weirdly affected American faux semi-British singing accent belongs with the music he used to make. But I do appreciate the angst/feeling in Tom's voice even if I will never like it, as do I appreciate him branching out and making some great songs for those of us who are *not* Blink fans at all. I love the unabashedly retro feel of the whole record--all that late 80s The Edge-mega-delay (I mean, really! It's like the guitar player played each chord once, pumped up the delay, and looped it while he had dinner). The opening track is lovely, and ""The Adventure"" is a song that will be around for ages. They alone are worth buying the album for, although almost all the tracks are quite good."
4,"Boxcar Racer v2.0 - Good for some, bad for others","Tom DeLonge is at it again with a new band and a new album. Even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from Boxcar Racer, Angels and Airwaves managed to have a completely different sound. They dropped the more punk rock tone of Boxcar Racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock. The first released single ""The Adventure"" is quite enjoyable and even though I haven't checked too deeply into it, I think it's the theme song for NBC's Studio 60.Besides, how can you go wrong with an album that's gone double platinum in the UK and gold in Canada?"
3,"Good album, but boring and tedious","I heard and liked The Adventure, but when I listened to the entire album, it just bored me. None of the tracks were distinguishable from another (except possibly distraction.) To make it worse, most of the songs were unnessecarily long, with boring intros and fadeouts. So if I were you, I'd buy the single of Adventure instead of the entire album. Because in We don't need to whisper, if you've heard one you've heard them all."
4,It Hurts....,"....Angels and Airwaves take emo-popcore to new heights. You have to be in the mood. There's already a glut of retro 80's new wave bands saturating the market, why we should we care about another? A&A; is not power punk and it's not exactly mellow enough to chill out to. The lyrics are abstract, the vocals a little overproduced, the drums sound like 80's metal, the guitar riffs and long song intros are directly lifted off of any Cure record that ever existed and the whole ""supergroup"" concept just seems silly and over-indulgent to me.But you know what? I LIKE the record! Who knows why? I think it does need a bit of repeated listens to take hold. I think it's a pretty decent album and I can appreciate the musical concept that DeLonge & Co are trying to establish.I probably sound corny, but ""life's waiting to begin""."
3,Everything is good except DeLonge's singing,"I had experienced the hype on this album just like everyone else, so I got it. I liked Blink, even though I'm a bit older than their target demo. Angels and Airwaves is a very well produced and well played CD. The production values are excellent, lots of use of multi track recording to create a round sound. I have no complaints about the musicianship or the songwriting. The only thing that took me out of the CD was Tom's nasal delivery. The songs are too mellow and melancholy for him to sing in a snotty punk-tinged Blink style. I was hoping he would stretch but I guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Still, an interesting insight into what could be. The guy has talent."
2,Nothing special,"This album never really goes anywhere. Most of the songs never reach a peak. There really arent any choruses that hit you. However, Tom really did try and it shows.The good: The Adventure, Do It For Me Now, It HurtsThe bad: the rest of the album."
2,Based On The First Listen,"I'm trying to be reasonable about this album. Perhaps my opinion is influenced by the fact that I only had like 4 hours of sleep and I'm quite groggy...The thing is, I didn't buy thisexpecting another Blink album. I heard ""The Adventure"" single and liked it so I expected alot of keyboards and stuff. Well there are plenty of ""keyboards"" but these songs aren't too catchy and this cd is kind of depressing. I really think he tried to hard to capture an ""epic"" mood. Alot of the songs sound the same, but then again, alot of Blink songs sound the same. I dunno. I won't say it sucks, but it's definitely lacking... I'm a huge fan of Blink (moreso the earlier stuff) so I won't give up on them. Perhaps this was just a shaky start..."
2,I respect Tom DeLonge...,"... I really do. He has the right to expand his musical horizons. While this cd is certainly listenable and OK for what it is (poppy-prog), it's just not my thing. The theme of the cd is quite optimistic but I find it strangely ""cold"". But hey, you might love it."
3,Blink 180-U2,"So you already know who these guys are.It sounds like Tom DeLonge has really spent a lot of time listening to ""War"" and ""The Joshua Tree"", and blended his instantly-recognizable Blink vocals with an anthemic sound that laughably recalls vintage U2.No seriously. You'll LAUGH when you here some of the guitar licks or drum patterns. They are that obvious.Not only can you name the U2 song, you'll even know which part.This is homage. This is flattery.The songs are merely OK. The single, ""The Adventure"" is a deserved hit, and a few others sound great on your car radio, but......I dunno. Maybe if you know too much Blink and too much U2, this is not the record for you..."
2,cheap is cheap,"These glasses are sold in a manner that suggests they are marked down, but they are clearly only worth the lower price. Once you figure in the shipping cost (almost equal to the item price) they aren't worth it. Also, bear in mind that they may not fit you since you don't have the ability to try on an online purchase (mine don't fit). And, in person, they are less round than they appear in the photo. My advice? Go buy some cheapo sunglasses at a store where you can at least see them on you first."
1,Don't gift this to an asthmatic!,"The description of this product is sub-par. It came with a big box of chocolate covered peanut clusters; I'm allergic to peanuts.I've only tried one of the coffee's and didn't care for it, but it's the first time I've had Kona coffee. The items I could consume, tried and enjoyed were the three biscotti, two truffles."
3,One size doesn't fit all...,If you have a bigger head like me (size 8 fitted) don't buy this because it won't fit. I put mine on out of the box and it was way too snug. I'll probably give it to my bother as a gift this year rather then ship it back.
2,Buyer Beware,"If you are looking for a particular volume of this set.........please ask questions before buying.While it definitely seemed too good to be true that you would get a 20 volume set for the price listedhere, I could find nowhere where it said any different. And in my naviete (can I say ignornance) Ithought it would at least be the first volume (which had been recommended for a particular pattern).What I received was a very ""flat"" package with..........volume 9..........in it. While the book itselfis full of nice, informative things.......it was still a disappointment. This book will be going to mylocal library in the hope that at least someone will get some use out of it.Amazon, I must say, that your item description definitely needs to be revamped to give customers aclearer indication of what they will be receiving..........."
2,Only one book!!,I was miss lead about this purchase... I only receieved one book instead of the whole set... I was very disappointed..... I really like the one book I received.
3,Performers great; recording mechanics stink,"Unfortunately, Gimell doesn't appear to understand the difference between disc 1 and disc 2; the tracks on disc 2 are titled the same as the first 8 tracks on disc 1. This makes ripping to Windows media player problematic, to say the least.The performers are, as usual, excellent. Would that their studio could get their act together.OT, I've got several Gimell albums; I've experienced problems with at least half of them, usually relating to problems between disc 1 and disc 2."
4,Corporate Fluency,"This book shows how a team can tap into its unique brand of vision and ""street smarts"" to create a fresh approach to doing business. Not about becoming a well-oiled machine, ""Breakthrough"" is about doing the personal and collective work (emphasis on work) it takes to support a collaborative spirit that (in the words of poet Wallace Stevens) ""is fluent in even the wintriest bronze."" The authors know this work is not for the faint of heart, but they maintain a tone of encouragement throughout that just might convince a reader to dip a toe into the stream."
4,Great Watch,I really like the size and color of this watch. It has great featureas and is very easy to set. I always buy Timex watches for my running as the price is right and they are very durable watches and last a long time.
4,Like the watch but buy a dark band!,"I have had this watch since June 2008 ( 4 1/2 months). My last Timex had a similar band that disintegrated after a year and a half. I hate these integral watch bands! I need a digital watch with a timer because my toddler needs transition time ( ""Three minutes then we have to go home from the park!""). I bought it in a stylish periwinkle blue because I get tired of the ugly gray and black bands, many digital watches have. The band is comfortable and I don't have to take it off to shower, etc, but it has turned from blue to an ugly greenish gray color. So, even though the watch works fine, I will have to buy a new watch because it looks awful. I don't want all the features as on an Ironman Timex, and my husband has forbidden me from buying a cheap watch of another brand because the instructions never work to set it. PLEASE TIMEX, MAKE THIS SAME WATCH WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE BAND!"
4,Works as desired,Nothing extraordinary to note about the watch. The watch is reasonably priced and does just what I need done. I have seen no deficiencies with this watch.
4,Very nice preset timer watch,"Margie's review: this watch replaces a previous similar model whose setting button froze up. This one is smaller than the previous model, has better contrast in the display, and is very easy to use. I like the preset timer feature that allows quick setting of the timer to 1,3,5,10,15,20,25,30,45 minutes or 1 hour. Not elegant, but a good day-to-day watch. Added: this watch turns out to have a new ""feature"" - for timer settings 30 minutes or longer it beeps half-way through. Might be nice for a walk, but not so nice for a nap...."
4,"that's LIVING dead, baby!","Brian (Brain?) Yuzna directs this great sequel of an unofficial sequel. Even without considering the budget, Yuzna does an amazing job here. It's hard to believe but he manages to ressurrect the series that got killed so utterly by part 2. The effects look great, the story is brilliant and often darkly comic but just as often tragic and the action is nonstop. An original take on the zombie mythos, and a fun way to spend an evening. Invite your friends who've never liked zombie flicks and after they'll even be begging for ""Hell of the Living Dead' (Let them watch Yuzna's 'Society' instead). A great DVD I'm excited to be adding to my collection!"
3,Its a good movie........but,"I must say yes it was a good movie but it is no Return Of The Living Dead Part 1. That movie I dont think will ever be beat.Although Resident Evil came close. I cant wait to see George A. Romero's new zombie movie ""Dead Reckoning"""
4,"Proposterous, Gory, Bizarre Installment","Finally checked this puppy out and it did not disappoint.Anyone who is familiar with Brian Yuzna's bizarre style of filmmaking should be able to appreciate this film. It has the feel that he created in the classic BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR which features a good balance of subte black comedy, outrageous gore scenes, Fangoria centerfold pinup worthy creatures and commentary.This is my favorite of the ROTHLD series, though I have yet to see parts 4 and 5. The comedy aspect is not quite as obvious as it is in part 1, but it is there and overall this one is more original and entertaining than part 2."
5,"Great Movie, but why rated R???",I loved this movie and I thought it was a great edtion to the other movies but why did they release the DVD as R rated when they put it on Tape as unrated? Yes there is a a unrated version out there and that the one I have. I hate to up grade my copy for cut up version.
2,Return of the Living Dead 3,"Return of the Living Dead 3 is a tale of love with a zombie twist. Curt loves Julie so much that when she is killed he goes down to where his father works and brings her back to life. The only way I remember seeing this is they ran it on sci-fi network and I saw bits and pieces of it. Also, the movie poster is when I remember from my childhood when renting vhs was a part of culture. Anyway, I watched the rater R version of this movie and it really sucked. It looked like they held back so much and i'm hoping to see an uncut dvd of this soon. The main character, Curt, is very annoying and just makes me want to turn this film off. He loves Julie so much and keeps her alive even though she is a zombie. Julie looked hot though and with less then half an hour left, she looked smoking hot in a sick, twisted way. The end of this film made me go wow, what a piece of trash!Overall, a few enjoyable parts but unrated version would have been better to watch."
1,Where the hell are Frank and Freddy???,"This movie just plain blows. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Yuck...don't waste your time. Either get the first two Return Of movies, or get the Romero trilogy...don't waste your hard earned dollar on this piece of tripe."
1,Does Amazon evan watch their movies,"what the hell is this!!!Don't see this movie at all.I don't know what these people are on ,but don't believe their lies.the story goes when this kid and his mental girlfriend are in a motercycle accident and the kid's girlfriend dies so he brings her back with 2-4-5 trixon.get this know the zombies eat flesh(you heard me,""flesh""not brains but ""flesh"").if you own this movie take it out to the back yard and eighther shoot it with a BB gun or burn it."
2,What Happened here?,"I have to say that this was a real disappointment. I am a big fan of the first two films, but after viweing this one, it seemed as if the creative team was running short on ideas. THe heroine of the story is infected, and eventually dies...ok, thats acceptable. Then she comes back to save to save her boyfriend...hmmmm...However the worst part of the film is when she returns, she has for some reason decided to adorn herself with bits of glass and metal that she stuck in herself. This film loses momentum minute by minute. A terrible conclusion to a fine series. ONe can only hope that a fourth installment is released to save this series!"
3,"Wanted to like it, and at times do, but it drags","The concept to this thrid installment to the Return of the Living Dead Trilogy has a good concept- son of a military man (the military man working at a lab resurrecting the dead from the last two movies in tests) is in love with a wild type of girl, and when she dies in a bad bike accident, he decides to ressurect her back to life in the lab. Like I said, a smart set up to what could've been a smart zombie movie, but the main problem is in how the girl, who turns into a hungry and ultra piercing freak, and her wusy boyfriend, make what should be a tragic and interesting tale into a lagging semi-comedy with minority characters with details as thin as Jack Skellington and homeless people sprinkled in just to buy time. Stuff to look for, in particular a good beginning and (very) ending, but not worth to watch all the way through unlike part 1."
4,Dan,"The third installment in the ""Return"" trilogy is the best. It is a definate 180 degree turn from the first two comedies. The film is as gory as it can get, and some of the zombies are a little too far out. However, the zombie girl - Army brat love story works pretty well, but the ending lacks strength.It is a good film in the end, I reccomend it."
3,This film has its highs and lows,"The film has a great story line of undying love but the film should have been made on it's own, not as part of a series. The first two films were funny and witty, while this film is too dark. The makeup effects on the girl were really great but the zombies just looked like they were made of play dough."
3,Not a bad film....,"Not a bad film...but a bad sequel.ROTLD 3 is, of course the sequel to the great ROTLD and the okay ROTLD 2.But this sequel is far different from the first two. The first two films were comedy/horror films, and worked very well.ROTLD 3, however, is darker in tone, and has no comic relief. Also, many elements are missing, including the infamous James Karen and Thom Matthews, and the greasy ""tar man.""That's why ""Return 3"" falls short of acheiving the great atmosphere the first two flicks had.The movie is pretty entertaining, if not somewhat disappointing."
3,"""It's not Romero""","Im almost sad to say I didnt like this one, probably because it wasnt directed by George. Yuzna was great with the Re-Animator and such but this movie was, I think the word is ""New."" Im a 70's 80's zombie films kinda guy. I think MAJOR Producers should stop after Resident Evil: 2 comes out. Excluding the Independent films. This movie had some pretty good scenes with that dudes head and spine getting ripped out, and the intro was pretty good with the experiments and the zombie revolting and killing the doctors, but it still wasnt Romero."
4,Cool nr. 3 !,"The third installment in the ""Return of..""series and a cool one. The first one was kind of a spoof of the Romero classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" and there was more stuff to laugh about that to be frightened.This third one is a good horror movie with your occasional scare and some good gorey FX. The story is rather simple but cool none the less.This guys girlfriend dies and he brings her back to life in his father's lab where he is experimenting on zombies. The girl gets rather sadistic and instead of eating flesh, she's starting to torture herself by sticking glass and other stuff into her well shaped body. A must buy for the nr. 1 horror fan !"
3,The army shouldn't play with dead things...but plucky teens should!,"If gore and comedy are your preferred combo, this seemed a passable treat. I caught it on cable, so I'm sure I missed plenty of the former. The first attack in the army base was actually pretty nasty and tense, well-filmed with the contrast between the stark white and the hideous blue/grey of the zombie. But once they're running around and the kid tries to keep his undead girlfriend under control, it was pretty laugh out loud funny."
3,good sequel in many regards good enough to put on blu ray with part 2,"This is a decent sequel to the first two movies but as others have pointed out this is played straight without the comedy elements of the first two. At least this sticks to the mythos of the series, in that the zombies eat brains and cannot be killed off by brain shots. The last two movies in this series that were made in russia were a huge drop in quality but that's another story. Still this one is a good zombie movie with great effects and good acting so that is a plus. This should be put on the same blu ray with part 2 and that would be a great deal. The dvd looks decent too so I would say fans of this zombie series should enjoy this effort."
3,"Disturbing, Flawed Gore Pic","While this film is by no means great (or terrible), it certainly remains one of the most disturbing from the gore wave of the '80s. The leading lady deserves a lot of credit for creating an iconic character. She is attractive, revolting, monstrous and pitiful all at once. Overall, the film is pretty sickening, rising above the level of utter hack schlock, but lacking the nuance to make it work. Bride of Reanimator is ultimately the more disgusting femme outing, but this one came closer to doing something worthwhile."
5,Third In This Series !!! (And Ms. Clarke Is HOT!!!),"This is a fine addition as the third instalment of this series. It concerns two teenage lovers , Curt and Julie who break into the Scientific Laboratory where Curt's father works thinking that cruel experiments are being performed on animals. Curt and Jukie flee the scene after being discovered and Julie is killed in a motorcycle accident. Curt then reanimates her but as anybody who has seen the first two movies knows she is now on the hunt for HUMAN BRAINS!!!! Aaaaargh!!!! Julie's transformation from Gothic Chick to Brain Eating Zombie is wonderful to watch . Melinda Clarke gives a fine performance in this movie and also appears in a state of undress in one scene which alone makes this movie worth watching!!!!"
2,This film needn't be watched,"I saw the film and was very dissapointed. It was completely different than the 2 parts before. All of my friends told me that this film 'd be bad, but I didn't believe it 'till I saw it. I hoped it would be better because the first part was definitely the best horrorfilm ever made."
2,It's NOT the zombies that need brains...,"Never too keen on zombie movies, but I checked out the video cover and it looked pretty good in a tongue-in-ghoulish-cheek way, but what we get is a sort of 'Romeo and Juliet' scenario, in an abysmal zombie flick. The F/X are not too brilliant and the characters can be somewhat empty and un-interesting. However Mindy 'The Killer Tongue' Clarke is very, very sexy (for a zombie!) and it had a nice touch with acclaimed horror director Anthony Hickox (Warlock: the armageddon, Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth) making a cameo as a doctor who becomes a zombie (""..Dr. Hickox has been killed!!""). As zombie films go, it's not too bad, it also seems very 80's for a film made in the 90's and to be honest it's nothing new."
3,Return of the Living Dead 3,"I thought the movie was really good. I have never seen it before. I really enjoy zombie flicks, so I decided to check this one out. Really gory, fake fake fake. I love fake stuff. Good actors and story. Check it out sometime."
2,"1 and 2 were great, 3 is a letdown","If you like these kind of movies like I do then you probably have bad taste (peter jackson is a genius)as it is, but if you like this 3rd installment then you have Michael Bolton bad taste. NOTD3 had nothing that made the first two so good. There were no mass of zombies taking over a town, no zombies spouting off funny one liners and worst of all, how could they not bring back Frank and Freddie after making them the stars of the first two. The other reviews talk about what made 3 so much better than 2 is that the plot was so different from the 1st and I say that is exactly what makes this film so bad. The only way you will like this film more is if you got a necro thing going on."
5,adding more memory always a good idea,This works great in my Dell Inspiron 4150 (all models use the same kind) really makes excel and word launch faster!
5,two hundred or so reasons to buy this box..,"So you probably already own the first box if you're looking at the second box. You're thinking that you already have the majority of the hits , and you do. You're thinking that you want this , but you aren't quite sure. Look , you picked up the first box , you probably LOVED it...pick up the second (and the third). You will hear songs that you never heard before , but that is what makes this box so enjoyable. It's like finding a new radio station circa 1968-1971 , playing songs that could have made the top 10...but didn't. You will not regret putting it in your shopping cart."
5,Seminal box set for soul & R&B fans,"It's amazing how many hidden gems are mixed in amongst the more well-known songs in this fantastic 9 disc box set. From Darrell Banks' ""Just Because Your Love is Gone"" to the Newcomers' ""Open Up Your Heart (and Let Me In), this is simply a treasure-trove of soul / r&b delights. If you like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, the Dramatics, etc, you will love this set....good for dancin', good for romancin'!"
4,Stax 1968-71 review,"I purchased the Complete Stax Soul Singles Vol. 2 to prepare for a 1970-1971 party. It provided me with a fabulous collection of songs from the period I was interested in, and a few standouts for me were ""Wade in the Water"" by Little Sonny, ""Do the Push and Pull"" by Rufus Thomas and ""That's what love will make you do"" by Little Milton. These tracks were upbeat and grooving. I did not care for all of the songs but overall it is a great collection. I also enjoyed the booklet inside- the pictures and the entire backstory of the record making process at Stax during that period provide an amazing time capsule. I believe I now want to purchase Volume 1."
2,Major Disappointment. Why? No B-Sides.,"This elaborate, expensive, boxed set which claims to be the Complete Stax/Volt ""Soul"" Singles has no B-sides.Yes, the tracks that are included are amazing, but as we all know, 45 RPM singles have TWO sides, so how can this set claim to be COMPLETE without BOTH sides? Idiots.I'm amazed that nobody has mentioned this previously in the reviews.Also, only records considered ""soul"" are represented, so the label's foray into gospel, rock, comedy & jazz are excluded.Compared to the impressive Complete Motown Singles Series, this set is an expensive letdown and wasted opportunity."
4,FROM A CHAPLIN FAN,Hi everybody!I like this dvd in first place because you can find most of theKeystone stuff wich are hard to find.I know the quality is not good but if you're interested in Chaplin earliest films i doubtyou can find it with a better quality nowadays.I also like this dvd because you can choose if you want to hear the original soundtrack or the sound of the old reelers.The presentation is cool too.Recomended for those who want to find the Chaplin Keystone reels.
1,"Great films, terrible quality","How many ways can we re-package and sell the same terrible prints and insipid soundtracks?Well, the great rip-off continues. These are early Chaplin films taken from lousy prints and with random awful soundtracks added on. This is cheap for a reason. Unfortunately, all the dvds of the Keystone films use the same crummy sources for the films, so until somebody gets off their duff and restores these fine films, we have to deal with this. But we don't have to like it!!Don't buy these dvds. Don't encourage these guys."
2,Not what I thought,"The two stars given are only because I love Charlie Chaplin. As for this collection, most of the pictures are in bad condition and the heads are cut off of the majority of Charlie's earlier classics. It makes it very frustrating to watch. I would pay a bit more and go for a company that cares, not one that just wants a quick buck!"
2,Should have been done better,"Although it's cheap, having closed-captioned feature together with English subtitle will make a good appeai to younger generation into watching this classic movies. And of course, the picture quality is ""kinda OK"" (Whaddaya expect from movies produced in 1914?). If you're into Charlie Chaplin & just like to have him on affordable & cheap DVD, pls help yourself to buy this. Otherwise, forget it. Regards, Irwan Shah from Malaysia."
3,101 Digital Sound Effects hilarious comical,"lots of funny stuff, you must hear track #30 Man snoring during humorous dream,#53 Alien laughing, and #83 Attack of killar bees"
1,Waste of Time,"This ""Bronze Happy Buddha 7in High"" would be a wonderful addition if it weren't for the fact that it is actually sold for $130 more than the listed price. I was disappointed at the lack of transparency and felt I'd wasted my time."
