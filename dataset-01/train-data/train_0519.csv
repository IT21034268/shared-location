2,Disappointing,"Seduced by the hype and Spiegel's gorgeous face adorning the book's cover, I purchased this book. It wasn't worthless, but its substantive content was very disappointing. I kept thinking, ""Sans her famous name (remember the Spiegel catalog?) and sans the good looks she was born with, could she still have achieved what she has?"" Jill Spiegel is such a dynamo that when I saw a video of her giving a seminar I wondered if she naturally has such a high level of energy or if she achieved it through pharmacologic manipulation. Frankly, most of us aren't so incandescent . . . so, back to my original question. Minus the famous name, minus the natural beauty, and minus the unfathomable energy level, could the rest of us substantially benefit from her techniques as presented in the book? I don't think so."
3,good stuff,"Mediocre writing, and not original stuff, but still good review of other similar books and lots of interesting stories. I would read another book by her."
2,Don't let the picture fool you...,"It looks like a very nice and decent bowl from the picture,however,it is very small!Yes,that's right,it's only a 8-ounce dessert bowl,but compare with the Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose Open Stock 12-ounce Soup/Cereal Bowl,it's much smaller but at a higher price!BEWARE!"
2,Craps makes you THINK you are a winner.,"I bought this game as an aid for learning how to play craps. That was a mistake. You can't keep track of your winnings because it gives you back what you lose. Nor does it handle bets properly. ""Any Craps"" should be a one roll bet but `Casino' leaves it on the table until you win or you crap out. It doesn't handle placing ""odds"" on a line bet properly, either.If you want to learn craps or simulate playing avoid this software. If you want to improve your self esteem by winning all the time it is a great buy."
5,"Music to ""float"" by","Beautiful, soft flowing music. Perfect for yoga, massage, or just simply to chill by. Let yourself go within. Float and drift. The rhythm is soothing. There is no hurry, hustle or bustle in these beautiful symphonic like tracks. Highly recommended."
2,Muses of Agua,I thought I would like this more than I did because of a review I read in a 'spa' magazine.
2,DUST COLLECTOR,"AT FIRST I LIKE IT BUT IT IS A MESS TO CLEAN UP AND WHEN I AM READY TO HAVE A GLASS OF JUICE I THINK ABOUT THE MESS AND GO TO THE STORE AND BUY FRESH JUICE....IT DOESN'T DO ALL FRUIT IE., RHINES OF ORANGES ETC., IT'S OK BUT LIKE I SAID WOULD PREFER SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO ALL FRUITS AND VEGTABLES AND NOT BE SUCH A MESS TO CLEAN UP...."
3,The Grinder,"This grinder is worth the. . . dollar amount but not much more than that. It handled my necessary duties of soft things such as ice cream and peaches, but once you got into the heftier materials, its strugled. That is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4 or 5."
3,A home made video of a families vacation.,Video was dissapointing in the complete lack of any narration or dialogue at all. It is simply a video of one families vacation to the big island with some music dubbed on as a background. Videography is decent. I give them credit for coming up with a way to help pay for their trip. It simply comes across as a home video.
3,"Hawaii, here I come","While the one review states that 'A Trip to Hawaii's Big Island' is nothing more than a family vacation put to video with repeating music, I must say I enjoyed it. I found it to be refreshing knowing that I was viewing a time of relaxation and enjoyment with the Thompson family and their trip to the big island. It is so easy to get sucked into promotional videos and tourist type activities only meant to make money for the tourist businesses. Being from Colorado and being snowed in for the fourth straight week of frigid cold, I found this video making me desire a trip to Hawaii."
4,Aloha,This documentary provided excellent footage of the big island of Hawaii. It really gives the viewer a sense of being on location in Hawaii. The scenery was breathtaking. The music was set perfectly to the movement of the video. A must-see for anyone wishing to visit Hawaii.
4,Good source of kanji,"I think this book is great for learners who are interested in learning to write kanji (because it gives the stroke order to each character), and to learn the usage of individual characters (it has many examples of how to combine kanji characters together). But for learners who are interested in the meaning behind the characters and methods of remembering how to write them, then there are better books out there (e.g. Kanji Pict-O-Graphix by Micheal Rowley). This is more like a dictionary allowing learners to look up characters using the useful index at the back. I think for absolute beginners to kanji characters, this wouldn't be the best book to start off with."
3,"Good dictionary, poor textbook","This books makes a nice kanji dictionary; using the stroke-count lookup or the radical lookup it's often much easier and faster to find a kanji in this smaller book than it is in one of the larger dictionaries.However, as a textbook for learning the kanji it ultimately fails, in my view. You will not learn to read Japanese solely by studying meanings and readings of kanji, and there is little purpose to learning the kanji if you are not going to read Japanese. You need reading practice in addition to this (reading passages also tend to be more interesting than endless drilling of readings and compounds).There are plenty of books which are better at teaching you to read Japanese, including ""Basic Kanji Book"" (volumes 1&2), ""Kanji in Context"", and ""Reading Japanese""."
5,best kanji book,"Easy to find kanji, excellent graphics, good type faces and a comprehensive study of kanji and kana forms.No tricks to remember kanji-which don't work anyway, just an ability to practice and review the kanji that you have alreadylearned. Perhaps it might be better if the kanji order was the same as in Japanese schools, but I am not sure that aforeigners needs are the same as Japanese kids."
3,CLASSIC IBIZA FLAVORED TRANCE ANTHEM....,"HOW MASSIVE IS THIS? PLAYED BY ALL THE BIG WIGS: OAKENFOLD, ARMIN VAN BUUREN, TIESTO, PAUL VAN DYK, SCOTT BOND, JOHN 00 FLEMING...CLASSIC PIANO RIFT AND BLISSED OUT CHORDS SET THE TONE FOR SUNSET GAZING...."
3,A bit simple,"While I do agree with the previous reviewer that this book is fun and a great light read, I found it a bit simplistic. If simple is what you want, then this book deserves the five star rating it received before me.However, I found the simplicity unsatisfying. None of the characters were deeply motivated. By this, I mean that they had motivations that were believable, but just... well, simple. I can't escape that word. It is the only adjective that fits.The other main complaint I have is that it took a bit too much set up to get to the payoff. The main characer (I've forgotten his name...) takes too long to become accepted by the elves, and I was getting ready to drop the book and forget about the whole thing.However, I am glad that I stuck with it. It was fun, it was light. It didn't change the world, and it surely didn't make a lasting impression on me. But it was enjoyable. If that's all you are looking for, then give this book a try."
4,Great Storyline,"I have to say that the storyline and narrative of Dreamfall: the Longest Journey is perhaps the best I've seen in a game so far. The characters are engaging, and although the cut scenes are long they're worth watching. It almost feels more like you're watching an interactive movie than playing a game, but that's not disappointing.The game play itself is a little weak, and very short. You'll spend about a weekend playing through simple puzzles and getting frustrated with the mouse control, sneaking and combat. But luckily the cut scenes are many, and ease you out of your frustration. After you've finished the game, however, there's very little playback value, and you're left feeling like you've missed out on something and just want to continue playing the game.So if you're in for the story and characters, you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for gameplay, Dreamfall isn't for you."
1,Avoid like hell,"The original game (The longest journey) was quite a decent game. It had some damned challenging puzzles, a ridiculous amount of great dialogue, and a good plot.This game, however, is a POS. It tacks on a useless combat system, dumbs down the puzzles, and ends with a 'to be continued' with impending world doom and your characters more or less dead/captured. It has some maddening 'missions' which consist mostly of running around and fetching. The overall sensation is somewhat akin to being repeatedly beaten with a crowbar, but less fun and more potential brain damage.Avoid with prejudice until they come out with the third in the series. Let's face it...2nd games in a trilogy are usually the worst and this one adheres to the rule well."
5,excellant!!!,"the product was in great condition... as advertised, and was shiped out quickly. Would definatly use this source again for future purchases."
2,Not very helpful for intending cruisers,"A lightwieght book, lazy graphics, too many references to their cat and fried food. For anybody seriously thinking about doing this cruise, or the ""loop"", you will find the lack of detailed information frustrating.Some half good photographs (not of the cat) and some reasonable charts showing tide flow etc, would be a sensible addition.All up, it's a bland read about a senior couple, doing a general cruise on a coastal waterway... search for a better publication if you are information hungry."
5,Captures the Essence,"What I like about this book is that it captures the real sights and smells of traveling the Atlantic Intracoastal. I believe that this must be what it's really like to live on a 30-foot boat for a year cruising up and down the East coast of the US. The author's descriptions put you right in the picture, and his sense of humor will make you chuckle. There is also a lot of useful information in this book. Anyone who dreams of doing anything like this some day will get a lot of enjoyment from this book."
4,A Boaters Perspective,"As an avid boater, I really enjoyed all aspects of this book. I have often thought (dreamed is more like it) of taking an extended trip aboard our boat, and reading this book really fueled that fire. I especially enjoyed the newsletter excerpts and all the nitty gritty stuff about the costs and preperation involved in undergoing such a voyage. The entire book was fun and informative reading. It would also be good preparatory reading for anyone who is contemplating an extended trip aboard a personal pleasure boat."
3,Good general review of an over-hyped author,"The Gale Contemporary Author's piece on Shigekuni is brief and factual, but provides only limited analysis of the output of this troubled writer. They did a good job of citing both positive and negative reviews of her latest book ""Invisible Gardens."" Understood best by targeted readers, this book is reviewed with the wise note that general ""readers of the book 'may be a bit baffled by the resolution' that is unexpected and inconclusive."" Damning with faint praise is something one doesn't often see in general biographical entries from Gale, but this one is well-considered."
3,Tweety Waffle,"My kids love having their Tweety Waffles for breakfast but the waffle maker doesn't last long. I'm on my third one. About every year and 1/2 it just quits working. I spoke to the manufacturer and they do not repair them. Also the warranty runs out after 12 months. Save your money, buy Mickey instead. My mother has had the same Mickey Mouse Waffle maker for 10 years without a problem. Unfortunately my kids don't want anything but Tweety (It was originally a gift to them so I just keep replacing it)"
2,doesn't last,"The kids love this, but it only lasted 1 year and three months. I took it apart and tested it with a meter to see what was wrong. The fuse was blown. Unfortunately, the fuse is not user replaceable..."
1,Disappointed,"I've had my tweety waffle iron for about 4 months now and in the middle of making waffles two days ago it just died. What a disappointment, it's not that old and it's only been used maybe 10-15 times. It's cute, but that's about it."
3,Disappointed 2,"I was also disappointed with this waffle maker. I received this item as a gift last Christmas, and it stopped working today - about a year later. It made good waffles, quick and easy. And, the kids loved it. But I expected it to last longer than 12 months."
3,Loved it...but it died after 2 years...,Tweety waffles were our favorite weekend treat for the family and any overnight guests. My son's friends talked on and on about the waffles they would eat for breakfast after a sleep over. We had it about 2 years and it just stopped working.The best waffles on the Tweety Maker were from the Krusteaz Belgian Waffle mix. Light and fluffy! Yum! And clean up was a snap with just a wipe down of the cooking surface. We loved it so much that I'm considering buying another one even though I worry it will die like the first one did.
2,very brittle material,"This bowl was the perfect size for a plant I have. It states it has a drain hole plug but what is doesn't tell you or show you is that the drain hole is up on the bottom curve of the bowl, not on the bottom proper. If you want to water the plant from the bottom (like I do) the entire bowl would have to be submerged. I tried to carefully drill a hole in the bottom of the bowl with the intention of leaving the plug in place and the entire bottom of the bowl cracked and shattered. I ended up throwing the bowl away (and wasting money) because there was no way to fix the bowl. I have ordered the Fiskara bowl of the same shape and size which states it has punch out holes in the bottom. I'll review it after it arrive."
5,Solid performance speed example,I really like that they included a version of the peices with the piano accompaniment (& a heavily muted cello for reference pitches/timing). Overall a solid rendition with enough artistic interpretation to avoid sounding like a music box or pure tone midi rendition. Likewise the interpretation is mild enough to give the listener leeway to build their own interpretation on top of canvas provided.
2,bad fitment,"Didn't fit at all. There was a 1/4"" gap between the bar and the bar ends. Kinda sucks. I ended up with throttlemeisters after that nonsense."
1,Very Unhappy,"I purchased my Electric Pressure cooker a year and a half ago. I was elated at the features and its working. And told everyone about it. It has broken and no longer releases the steam, and the overlow leaks everywhere. I have to use a fork to release the pressure and the food no longer cooks, and when the pressure is released it spurts out all over the pressure cooker. We treated it like a baby, cleaning it every time after using. And we are heartbrokem as we paid over ... and after the warrenty expired it broke. I had a old fashioned cooker for 20 years and other than changing the gaskets it always worked, but I am afraid of them, and was very happy to get a electric one. But now in a delima as we just lost [money] and want a good one, but will have to look elsewhere. I called the repair people and the cost is more than we can pay and could use to buy another.Very sad....Eunice Mellinkoff"
2,No Manual!,"I can't properly rate this item because I can't use it. I ordered it some time ago and never unpacked it. I finally took it out of the box so that I could use it and found there is no manual. If I ever figure out how to use this, perhaps two stars might be too low...or too high!"
1,Gpx PDL805 8.5 inch Portable DVD Player,"I was mailed two brand new units from a vendor, and both units were defective. This unit has problems. The first one wouldn't play DVD's, and the second jammed up and would not reboot. Then, after receiving a refund from the vendor, I didn't get all that I paid. Spend a little extra and save yourself the headache."
1,Not good,"I used it three times and now I have all sort of problems like: it won't load, can't see the picture, it can't read the disk, it stops by itself, and the list goes on...Really bad for me..."
4,Gpx portable dvd player,This is a very nice little unit. Wish the carry bag would hold all the cords but other than that its great.
1,Disappointing DVD player,"I purchased the GPX DVD player in 2009, and it worked fine for about a year. About the time the warranty expired, it failed to read a disk or stopped repeatedly to read the disk - making it completely useless for watching on a TV. I have another DVD player (Panasonic), and it has worked perfectly for 3 years. By checking all disks on the Panasonic, I was able to confirm that it was the GPX player that had failed and not a problem with the disks."
2,False Advertising,Just purchased GPX's PDL 805 to play Region 1 and 2 DVDs. The product description specifies it will play both NTSC and PAL. It DOES NOT. I tried to get technical support from the seller (no luck) AND from the maker - GPX.com. GPX's technical support told me it will play European DVDs only when ... hooked up to a PAL TV! Needless to say I didn't get a portable DVD player to keep it connected to a TV. What a bunch of nonsense. Don't buy it if you want to play PAL DVDs.
1,Don't buy from GPX,"My GPX portable DVD player stayed in its box until the day before a family trip. Once out of the box, the player worked for 2 hours and then the screened died. When I got around to calling, I was first told it must have been me dropping it (I think I would remember that and I would think there would be some kind of mark from an impact hard enough to kill a screen on a PORTABLE device). Then, they said they could help if it was in warranty. I had called a little later than I expected and they said that although I called 84 days from when I received the unit, I was 92 days out from when I ordered it - so sorry, we cannot help you. The funny thing - they couldn't care less that the product failed within 2 hours!!!! I would NOT recommend GPX products."
4,Taut Thiller,O.R.3's premise is not new but the writing is fresh and invigorating. The sub plots and the characters makes this an interesting book. Plus the book was not predictable. The Jane character had me on pins and needles. Jane is a real survivor. Dr. McIntyre came across loud and clear as the villain he really was. All in all it was a good thriller.
1,Unpleasant and time consuming,Takes forever to apply and once you do your skin feels dry and has an unpleasant film. It is not moisturizing at all.
1,Deceptive,"Even my review came requesting that I ""review"" the item I purchased, Cellex-C Advanced-C. However the produce I actually received is the Cellex-C High Potency Serum, NOT Advanced-C. Unfortunately I did not notice until after the packaging had been thrown away so I am stuck with the wrong product."
5,A Writer Worth Discovering,"I am really glad to see Sheila Simonson's books available on the Kindle. I have always enjoyed her work as it grounds the historical period in real-life concerns applicable to contemporary life -- all the while keeping true to the sensibilities of the time frame. Simonson's plots seem to unravel in a logical manner without broadcasting every upcoming event. ""Bar Sinister"" particularly deals with the economic realities of war and its effects on families -- definitely a topic relevant to the present.An author well worth discovering."
5,Flashy in hot water again,"Flashman gets roped/coerced into masquerading as a Danish prince and the action gets furious from there. Written in the first person, Flashman is brutally honest about himself and others, and waxes philosophical more often than he should, but then this is part of his ""autobiography,"" take it or leave it. A good deal of human nature can be learned from him.I think many of us will live vicariously in Flashman's reluctant adventures, especially the erotic episodes. Being a 19th Century Anglophile, I enjoy the History, phrases and terms used then, as accurately described by Fraser. I am most impressed at his research for the background and settings used. For a while, I wasn't sure whether Flashman had been a real person.Strongly suggest that the reader read the Flashman series in order, starting with the first one, Flashman: 1839-1842, to get the most out of the series. If you are really into it, read ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" first."
3,A letdown,"Having thrilled to ""Flashman"", I eagerly desired to read ""Royal Flash"", what I understood to be the second book in the series, being confused because of the lack of a chronological list in the copy I read. I found ""Royal Flash"" to be much inferior to its predecessor, although I couldn' put it down. The plot was altogether too implausible, full of holes into which my willing suspension of disbelief was constantly being dragged. Flashy wasn't given the opportunity to be as interesting as in the first book, as he was swept along through the whole book, an obliging tool, rarely being given the opportunity to exhibit his cowardice, his deceitfulness, all those bad qualities that amuse us. I also wished we had learned what had transpired after Carl Gustav learned that his erstwhile benefactor had stolen his wife's crown jewels, both actual and metaphysical. With the exception of several great passages, this book turned out to be a run of the mill adventure story, and not a very good one at that."
3,A Ripping Great Yarn,"It's characters like Harry Flashman that made the Empire great. A brilliant soldier, a magnificent tactician and decorated hero...what a pity it's all false! At the very least, misinterpreted.It is a credit to George MacDonald Fraser's literary talent that he took an obscure secondary character from a dusty classic and created a first-class series of historical comic-dramas that, as a history teacher, I would recommend to my students.The reason I gave this only three stars, though, is that my interests lie in the realm military history and this book, although superb in it's narrative was lacking a really stirring battle sequence."
3,Another fun read,The second in the Flashman series. Not quite as good as the original but still a worthy read. Fraser's style makes these books very enjoyable.
2,You may as well walk off the stage when Lola Montez does,"The opening chapters are a fascinating little ""what if"" involving Otto von Bismarck meeting the famed Victorian boxer John Gully. It's well worth reading. The opening lines, having nothing to do with the rest of the book, are my favorite in the whole series.But once the Magnificent Montez exits, the book turns into a stale Prisoner of Zenda retread. The devices of making Flashman/Rassendyl the coward and bully we all know he is, or satirically suggesting that Hope copied his novel from Flashman's story, are outrageous enough to be entertaining, but not enough to keep the interest level up for the whole ride.I'm hopelessly addicted to the Flashman series and have read eight of them so far. I'd recommend any of the other seven above this one, especially the original Flashman!, as well as Flashman and the Redskins."
1,Golden Retriever is Still Afraid of Thunderstorms,"This is the second time I've tried this medicine, and the most it did for my 65 pound Golden Retriever was take the edge off, if that. He still runs around hiding and destroying things he is too big to hide under. The reason why I got this in the first place was because he dug a hold in the bathroom through the wallpaper, and destroyed the wooden molding on the door until he was bleeding. I didn't have time to give it to him to early with these summer storms giving no warning at all, but I would think it would kick in sometime in the middle of the storm that lasted an hour. I think I'm going to try buying something in pill form and see if that works. It was just too hard to give this medicine to my dog, and if I put it in a bowl to pour down his throat, I'm not sure how much he is actually getting with the sticky formula sticking to the bottom of the bowl."
2,Didn't help at all,"I got this in preparation for a long distance move I was going to be making with 3 cats. My cats were going to have to spend 12 hrs in a car and I wanted to make it as easy on them as possible. I ordered this a few weeks in advance and tested it out on the cat that I knew was going to have the most issues with the car ride. He also tends to get very hyper at night and drives the other two cats nuts, so I gave this to him in the evenings, hoping it would help calm him down. The dropper made it easy to give to my cat and he didn't seem to object too much to the taste, but it made no difference in my cat's behavior. I tried it multiple times and also tested it on one of my other cats. It never made a difference for either of them and I ended up throwing it away."
2,paperback size is TOO small,"The version I bought is the paperback version. It's way too small a format to see the photos, much less the print. While the photos are well printed and look good (and why wouldn't they at this teeny tiny size?) I can't say I'm appreciating the book; buy the larger version."
3,Personalized observations of the Bhagwan,"While this book is better than many of the other books written by ex-Rajneeshees, it is still a highly personalized account of the author's interactions with the Rajneesh movement. The author clearly has some sympathy for the Rajneeshees, but also sees their mistakes and criticizes their antagonistic attitudes towards the people of Oregon. Still, there are few details about how Rajneeshpuram was established or what happened to some of the major players after Rajneeshpuram collapsed."
4,TELLS IS LIKE IT IS!,"Not that I was there or know anyone that was. But having friends who were part of another cult type group and hearing their stories and reading this I am amazed at the similarites in these guru/cult like organizations.It is like there is a guru acadamy somewhere and they have all had the exact same courses.Be prepared to be dismayed and alarmed at the numbers highly intelligent, learned professionals who are ready to succumb to infantilization, sucking their thumbs and giving their power to the omnipotent Daddy.I recommend this one along with Enlightenment Blues and Mother of God. The only others I have read so far on the fallen guru track."
3,"The last decent Post-Apocolyptic, Cold War Era film worth watching before the cold war melted..","David Carradine has never let a project's budget(or in this case, lack thereof!) stop him fromearning a paycheck. Mr. 'Kill Bill' did verywell in this likeable cheapie from the RogerCorman American Independent studios, 'Straight-to-Video-since-the-drive-Ins-went-the-way-of-the-buffalo' set. Dawn Wildsmith (she was verygood in Armed Response and Future Force as well),Sid Haig (who doubles here as Second Unit Direc-tor!), Robert Quarry and even flat-chested BrinkStevens pull off good performances in a movie w/so little Special Effects that it makes Mad Maxlook like A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STUDIO RELEASE!Carradine is always worth a look and WHAT THEHELL has happened to WILDSMITH since the end ofeighties three-pics-in-a-row w/ Mr. Kung Fu?(Can anybody still get me her number? Wow shelooks great in that outfit in the tent when she'sbeing held hostage!) Worth a watch. But not asgood as Deadly Surveillance!"
5,GOOD FILM,"Typical David Carradine film,only problem the film print is quite soft for a DVD,in fact my VHS tape is a lot sharper.Recommended though for fans of David."
3,Great while it lasted,"I loved the convenience of this pressure cooker and we used it 2 or 3 times a week for about a year, but then it starting fritzing out and eventually quit working. It just wouldn't come to pressure, and the buttons on the front were wearing out. We bought a second generation stove-top pressure cooker by Kuhn Rikon and it's fantastic, but you have to watch it, unlike an electric pressure cooker."
3,Didn't last,"While I loved this pressure cooker while it lasted, the product quit functioning totally after 18 months. It was out of warranty and Farberware will not repair it."
1,"Wanted to love it, ......But it let me down","The farberware FPC800 just ruined a huge stew I was making. I've only used it about 5 times, all without a problem. Tonight it continued cooking after the timer went off. I noticed this when the $15 of stewing beef started to smell burnt. When I opened the cooker, the meat had all blackened on the bottom and the sauce completely gone.I've been cooking with other pressure cookers for years, I was led astray by the ease of not having to watch the pot. I'm sure the thermostat in my cooker is not working."
3,need help,i purchased the farberware pressure cooker so i could get dinner on the table for three teenagers all on different schedules. i have tried to make it work but have been unable to. i have the recipe book but i do not have the video and i can not see where i can order it. i need the book or video for dummies because i must be too dumb for this pressure cooker. i really want to make it work. pleas help
2,a radio show recording,This is just a replay of a George Noory radio show where he interviewed James Mullaney. The first 20 minutes is a rehash of 'who was Edgar Casey?' there is no video only a few still photos beyond that of Noorey & Mullaney. I wouldn't discount it completely but if you already know who Casey was then it will give very little new. Likely you can find this interview in the public domain without the pictures?
2,Abysmal failure,This product was slow and just about useless. Glad I got rid of it. If I knew it was just a pocket organizer I would not have wasted my money/time.
2,Good ideas presented as a first draft.,"If you have ever wanted to read a book (about being gay and middle aged) with good ideas that are presented as a first working draft of a manuscript with no revisons, then this is the book for you."
5,Terrific album,"This is an amazing album. It grabs you from the first track. The combination of the melodies and the way they are delivered is irresistable. It's a real shame it's out of print. And one shouldn't get hung up on the French pronuncation, because this is medieval and/or Renaissance French, where they actually pronounced all those letters that modern French leaves out."
3,crazy!,"These Eye remixes incorporating tracks from Taiga, OOIOOs latest album, takes that original percussive hard edged tracks into more electronic territory with dense waves of electronic noises shooting in and out against the backdrop of danceable 4/4 beats. However, this is really only for die-hard fans of either Boredoms or OOIOO. Newcomers might want to start with Boredoms' 'Super Are' or the monumental 'Vision Creation Newsun'."
5,she gives me chills!,"i randomly found bertine and listened to a few tracks, i was instantly hooked. everything but the girl meets bjork. lovin' it!"
5,Queen of Tejano music,"As Elvis is the King of pop, Selena will always be the Queen of Tejano music. Fans of hers as well as Tejano music fans will enjoy listening to and dancing to the music on this CD."
3,A Nice Little Early Career Over-View,"There really is nothing to say for this compilation album (although I would argue it's nearly an EP)as far as musical quality. Within are contained a few of Selena's early hits, most of the songs from her ""Entre a Mi Mundo"" album. There is nothing special about this disc and it contains no liner notes of any sort. It is really just a quick look at a few of her hit Spanish recordings.The only other thing I want to mention is that this album gets re-released every few years with a different cover but the same track-listing. If you plan on buying this one be sure not to buy the others.http://www.amazon.com/Exitos-Y-Recuerdos-Selena/dp/B000H4JHBC/ref=sr_1_8?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1301190040&sr;=1-8http://www.amazon.com/Exitos-Del-Recuerdo-Selena/dp/B000000VET/ref=sr_1_31?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1301190333&sr;=1-31Personally, I think if you're looking for a good ""Greatest Hits"" type album that there are many better compilations out there, not to mention more extensive."
4,book review,"Fantastic read, anyone out there not happy with being treated the same as everyone else this book is a must read. Very good for any life coaches aor holistic coaches."
3,Very detail,"It details all the different composition of human and animal body and how this vary from one individual to another, for example, in a study with rabbits, the contents of albumina in blood rate from this range to that range concluding that not everybody have the same biochemistry. So what the author does in a creative manner is register all this values of different components like hormones, vitamins, etc. in the body and how it differs from one person to another."

3,Great little light but it arrived broken. Come on MagLight.,"I got this flashlight for my 5 year nephew and he loves it but not until he had to ship it back as it arrived broken. The replacement works great but he had to ship it back and my brother had to pay for shipping to return it. Thanks to Amazon this is easy but he still had to drive to the post office and pay for return shipping.Come on Maglite, improve your quality control.I still recommend this flight light, its bright and comes in camo design, but make sure to look at Nebo flash lights too as they are competitively priced on Amazon."
3,"OK, but I must have been tired...","I was looking for an AA powered LED flashlight and missed that this one was a regular bulb light. It's good, but just not what I was hoping for."
3,interesting b-sides,"if you liked anything from zaireeka, you'll like up above the daily hum. i'm glad it wasn't on the album, but it and the instrumental are cool."
3,Solid but slow!,"I have been wanting a rotisserie for a long time and rejected the POPEIL oven as being uni-functional. I replaced a toaster oven with a BIG GEORGE so that I could also use it as a small oven for casseroles and baking. I TRY to minimize my use of electricity by using smaller ovens whenever possible. It is really well designed and built, and I do like it. HOWEVER, it takes me at least two hours to get a four pound chicken ready for the table instead of about 75-90 minutes. I have now used the rotisserie for lamb, pork and chicken and of course the results ARE juicy and tender. I baked muffins in it and they took half an hour and never seemed to come up. I wanted to rotisserie my Christmas turkey.. gosh I wonder how long that is going to take!"
2,NOT SAFE !,"I purchased this rotisserie and thought it would last a while . I was WRONG ! I owned it for abt 6 months and used it approx 10 times doing Chicken and pork on , and it stayed plugged in but NOT on all the time . It started malfunctioning and smoke coming from the motor area . If we had not been home this would have caught our home on fire . NEVER GO AWAY AND LEAVE THIS ROTISSERIE PLUGGED INTO WALL OUTLET (Don't have to be on for it to malfunction ) . I have contacted the manufacture on this and have not had a reply yet . I saw above where there was some issues with it ."
1,not happy,Big George forman GR80 Rotisseriewas dlivered in a good time frame but it was all greesy and in bad shape. The rotisserie moter did not turn on the unit . so I took my old George that stoped working over many years of use and I swaped out the rotisserie part on them then I had to clean the greese and grime out of the one I that orderd this took me about 2 hours to clean . I was very unhappy about how it looked and worked .
5,Best Ever Rotisserie,"I have owned the Big George Rotisserie since they first hit the market. It has been used at least once per week for all of these years and has been great to cook with. It has been very reliable and produces a great meal. Although, it is starting to wear out and would like to buy another one but I have found that is ""discontinued"". This saddens me and I am forced to research other brands because I like the bigger rotisserie. Why did you discontinue this Big George? Please make more. Thanks."
2,Baby Geroge Rotisserie,"I purchased a baby geroge rotisserie there was no instructions or cooking manual, I have the grill and I use it ofter. I would like to have a cooking manual, please let me know if this does not come with this item, with most electronic items their is some type of manual. There was nothing in the box except the packing and registration card. I have been looking forward to this item because it is small. Thanks"
1,piece of junk,"About 18 months ago I purchased a George Foreman GR80 Rotisserie. I was happy at first to get started roasting a large turkey in it,when I was done it took forever to clean it.I let the roaster sit for several months then used it again,this time the temperature setting malfunctioned,and even started a small fire that caused the glass on front door to shatter. I would never purchase another,or recommend this unit to any person."
2,BIG GEORGE ROTISSERIE,"I READ ALL THE REVIEWS AFTER RECEIVING GEORGE AS A GIFT--------I WAS SO EXCITED TO OPEN THE BOX AND GET GOING, BUT NO INSTRUCTION BOOK AS A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE STATED. CAN ANYONE GIVE SOME ADVICE AS HOW TO RECEIVE ONE-----HAVE CONTACTED COMPANY BY EMAIL AND NO RESPONSE. ANY HELP OR SUGGESTIONS FROM ANY ONE WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS"
3,"A great product, but...","The very first time we used the appliance it caught on fire. The grease tray ignited and was only scant seconds from spreading to the overflow on the counter when we returned from Christmas services. I'm sure it is a great product, just a caveat to other owners. We plan to buy another."
4,Hazardous part,I like the rotisserie very much. However I cut my hand very bad on the metal sheet below the rotesserie that holds the drip pan. this metal sheet is very sharp across the front length of the rotisserie. I did not know this and attempted to wipe underneath the rotisserie and sustained a very bad cut. This needs to be checked out.
5,George lives up to it's name,"I received the GR80 last week. We cooked a pork roast in it on Sunday. It was the most delicious, succulent piece of meat we ever cooked in our home. The key is to read the instruction manual before you get started. The roast was done to perfection in exactly the time indicated in the manual. The only bad thing is that the temperature setting indicator dots are very small. From our first experience, I think we are going to enjoy George for a long time."
3,ribs,"does it cook ribs without additional equipment? I know with the Ronco rotisserie, that is an extra purchase? Anyone know?"
4,This item is wonderful but....,This rotisserie is one of the best things I have in my home. I think my husband loves it more than I do. Lemom pepper chicken cooked in the rotisserie is just about the best thing there is but a word of caution~~when wiping down your counter under the front of the machine be careful not to slice your finger off. There is a sharp metal piece that will cut you. Other than that this rotisserie is the greatest thing you can have in your home. I can't imagine ever being without one now. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,PERFECT,"I bought this one together with Collection One and for both I have the same review. Both are just perfect, everything came in quick and works flawlessly!! COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED"
3,An interesting exercise in memory,"This author intrigues me. I was enthralled by her memoir ""Blue Windows"" about her mother and Christian science - published under another name.This book is fascinating because she is describing journeys she took years ago, while still a young woman. It is more an exercise in travel memory than in travel writing as we usually experience it.I liked it - it was well-paced, and as a novice travel-writer myself it inspired me and gave me ideas while I was on the road."
2,Very bad quality,"Once I opened the bag I noticed some broken stitches, I was very dissapointed, the logo is beautiful and is true to size, but the quality is very very poor"
3,Sort of Interesting,"This book did give some interesting history about how the street names originated. It would have been more interesting if perhaps the book could have contained photos of Albuquerque. It also would have been a better read if they perhaps incorporated the history of local landmarks, nevertheless, it was neat to learn the origin of some of the street names in Albuquerque."
1,"awful, awful!","I was interested to acquire this book because I was curious to know the origin of many of Albuquerque's street names.Unfortunately, I am STILL curious.Here's a few examples of names that aren't in there: San Mateo, Wyoming, San Pedro . . .Has the guy ever been to Albuquerque? How can you send a book off to print without having at least a couple of sentences about the city's major streets, even if just to print unconfirmed theories? I kept flipping around in the book to make sure I had the right city. It does have Lomas, Carlisle, and Juan Tabo, though. But just because it's a major street in Albuquerque doesn't mean that it's in here, which I view as inexcusable.Meanwhile, as if to play with you, the book straight-facedly informs you that ""Rio Grande"" was so named because of its proximity to the river, and ""Academy"" got its name because it ran along the Albuquerque Academy."
5,Works Flawlessly!,To use this you must already have Fritz 13 installed on your computer. The 9 DVDs install painlessly-a long but worthwhile process. Once installed they are seamlessly integrated into your Fritz 13 program. They increase the endgame playing strength of your program enormously. Not only the endgame: the program can sense this endgame knowledge database on the fly and without any effort on your part it uses this information to formulate strategy in the late middle game and even earlier-as far back as it can see. It is like giving your chess program a brain boost. For the serious chess player this is a key enhancement for you Fritz 13 program. It allows the program to do things like announce a mate in 57 moves. This along with the required Fritz 13 give you the strongest chess analysis tool available today.
3,Otherwise good performance marred by Antony,"The idea of Lou Reed backed by just guitar, bass, and cello was a good one. Fernando Saunders and Mike Rathke have been with Lou for a while now and understand his music better than almost anyone has. Newcomer Jane Scarpantoni (formerly with Bob Mould's band and the psych-pop band Tiny Lights) adds great John Cale-like texture on cello. But what Lou sees (or hears) in vocalist Antony is beyond me. Antony trills his Klaus Nomi-esque falsetto throughout and absolutely kills whatever he attempts. ""Candy Says,"" a great, underappreciated VU song, is almost unlistenable. I'd rather hear Lou talk-sing his way through it than this version. Suffice it to say I'll hit the skip button on Antony's songs when I listen to this one again."
1,What's In An Award? Come On!,"Just a note to respond to the reviewer who says that those of us who couldn't stand Hegarty singing on Serenade should be ashamed, or have 'egg on our faces'. The rationale, apparently, is that Hegarty recently won a prize (a 'Mercury'). In my lifetime so far, I've seen more undeserving people be rewarded by their peers than otherwise (did BlindBlake get a prize, did Robert Johnson? I dunno. Do I care? Is THAT why many like these musicians?). Mostly, however, there's something horribly patronizing about being told that the tastes of others -- a panel of experts/judges? I don't even know who! -- are superior to one's own, particularly when the entire issue is about subjectivity. Maybe some know what to like by observing who gets what award; others might like to make up their own mind. After listening to Serenade again the other day, I was reminded of just how awful 'Mercury Man' Hegarty sounded. Lou oh Lou, how could you give him ""Candy Says"" !?!?"
3,Came for Antony; Stayed for Lou,"I'd assumed that Lou's best days were long behind him; besides just how many live albums can one artist release, right? I bought this because I'm a big fan of background vocalist Antony of Antony and the Johnsons, and it was worth the price of the set alone for Antony's lead vocal performance on ""Candy Says."" But here's the real surprise: at 60+ Lou Reed is still fascinating! In other words, Antony is the sweet icing on a pretty grand cake. Imagine my surprise!"
1,Painful to listen to,"I'll be honest and say I only listened to about 4 tracks off this album, and I found it so awful, it was actually painful for me to listen to it. Lou sounded like he was spontaneously handed a microphone to entertain some buddies so he decided to make words up on the spot and ramble a bit. Not only that, but his voice wasn was weak, dull, and just plain bad. I know he's over 60 years old, but if you can't give a good show, there's no reason to get up on that stage!So terribly disappointed.."
1,weak,"huge lou fan. these are some of his best songs ruined by antony. im not sure who this freak is, but he has an incredibly annoying voice, and is clueless to rock. maybe its what i needed to get off lou.eddieturtle73@hotmail.com"
5,RARE LIVE PERFORMANCES,"I just want to highlight that this CD includes the first live performances I've heard of ""Men of Good Fortune"" and ""The Bed."" I was fortunate enough to see Lou Reed's Berlin tour in December 1973. In fact, I attended his unbelievable performance at The Academy of Music that was captured on ""Rock and Roll Animal,"" (if only there were a DVD of that concert -- he was amazing, totally manic), and I was disappointed that he didn't perform more songs from that album, such as the above mentioned titles. (I still await to hear, one day, a live performance of ""Caroline Says II"" or its original version ""Stephanie Says.""Also, this CD includes, to my knowledge, the first live performance of ""Sunday Morning"" in many, many years. I remember seeing Lou during his ""Mistrial"" tour and someone shouted out to hear ""Sunday Morning"" and he was highly dismissive of the request.This CD is definitely worth picking up."
4,Yet another side to the great man,"No drums? What happened to Lou's insistence that drums, bass and 2 guitars was all you need? Doesn't matter. I saw him in Melbourne on the Ecstasy Tour, and some in attendance were disappointed that he focused almost entirely on that album...but that's what you get with Lou Reed. This album is the perfect complement to that tour. Just sit back and listen...it's a good two hours. Songs like How Do You Think It Feels and Set The Twilight Reeling show the depth of Lou Reed's work. Now if only I had a recording of Paranoia in E from that Ecstasy Tour I could die happy..."
5,One of his best,"Lou Reed is certainly hit or miss when it comes to live performances; however, this one definitely falls under the hit category. The recording captures Lou in a good and playful mood which translates into a good time for all. The songs cover a wide range of his career from Velvet Underground up to The Raven. It includes an incredible version of Venus in Furs with scathing cello playing by Jane Scarantoni. (worth the price of this CD alone, IMHO). I would have loved to hear how this ensemble tackled some of his songs from Magic & Loss; namely What's Good, Power and Glory, Sword of Damocles and Magic & Loss."
3,A nice magazine with too many ads,"Guideposts puts out great devotional books and materials, however, the monthly magazine is a disappointment. It is filled with too many fall out cards and advertisements. Some of the articles are useful and timely."
1,Not what it used to be,"If you have loved these Mason Cash bowls in the past, don't think that anything comparable is what you will get with this. They are no longer made in England (not noted in the listing)but in Asia. They are thinner and weigh less. The 12"" bowl shipped to me weighed over a pound less than my original. I can't believe they aren't more fragile. My new one is going back - with regrets. Terry Allen"
5,Classic!,"I have been reading this book to my children for over 10 years. And my children have learned to read by reading this book. Now, my 12 year old loves to read it to her brothers. A book that is a wonderful addition to the family time."
1,"Started out cute, then turned violent","I got this book to read to my two year old and it was cute and enjoyable, I even was thrilled about the alphabet being used in the story, until, I reached the part about using guns to kill the pink spots on the snow. As the story went on to tell the tales of the cat's mischevious exploits of how he left a spot that travelled around the house and was then blown out into the snow, for some reason guns were now needed to ""Kill"" the spots on the snow. Why one would want to introduce guns and the word kill in a children's story I do not understand. I rate this book poor because of this and am disappointed in Dr. Seuss"
3,Not As Good As Cat In The Hat,"Recently bought this for my daughter after she loved Cat In The Hat. However, I don't find the story anywhere as inspired and the rhyming is weaker. It's a pity he left out the fish. The proof is in the pudding: my daughter requests The Cat In The Hat more, followed by Green Eggs and Ham."
2,"disappointing, guns disturbing","This book is disappointing compared to the original. Also of concern, there are guns and talk of ""killing"" the snow spots which is very upsetting and not something I want to read to my two year old. I know it's because of the time in which it was written but it just isn't very good. However my son does seem to love it, and requests it often, even though we are not fans of the book at all."
1,"As a parent of a 4 yr. old boy, I cannot reccomend it.","The hidden messages of permission to shoot up the mess, and thern magic dust will clean it all up; these messages in our volitale crime within our youth society is of great concer4n to me and our family. It was not a good story for my child. I've read alot of books to my child and I've never had this reaction. NO GOOD!!!!!!"
2,"Love Dr. Seuss, but I don't approve of this book","I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss since he was a favorite of mine as a child. When my 3-year-old first took ""The Cat in the Hat Comes Back"" off the shelf, I was happy to read it to her. However, I was not happy when the Cat reveals little Cats A-G, only to have them whip out guns, explaining ""My cats are good shots. My cats have good guns. They will kill all of those spots."" Then after he unveils the other little cats who are armed with bats and rakes, they continue to state that they will ""Kill the spots!"" I don't approve of this kind of language or imagery in a children's book. It's bad enough that there is violence all over the media - on television, in video games, and even children's toys. I keep my child away from these influences, but thought I could trust Dr. Seuss with his whimsical charm. Unfortunately, I can't. I just wanted to give this heads up to parents considering this book."
4,first one was better,i liked the first Cat in the Hat book better than this one. This one wasn't as funny as the first one was either.
3,The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,This book the The Cat in the Hat Comes Back is about a cat that shows up at these littlegirls house and wants to play. The girls know that he causes mishtif and they kinda did notwant nothing to do with him. Before you new it he was in the bath tube eating cake withpink frosting on it. He gets the pink frosting all over the place and keeps getting on thingsand they half to try to get it out.This book teaches kids that they should not trust straingers and that they should stay away from them.The age level for this book is seven and up because it is kinda hard to fowl because thereis allot of rhyming in the book. It is also kinda long.I think that the book was alright it is not the best but it was ok I give it a three out of five.
4,"The Cat Came Back,for he couldn't stay away!","The Cat Comes Back,alright!And he has fun as only he can with the same children.However,he has too much fun-and in an attempt to get rid of the mess, he has his other cats-with their own hats-help. They hinder more than help,however-but the whole mess is cleaned by the smallest cat of all(who'd probbably be right at home in Who-Ville)."
5,Its super funny,The part I liked most was when his shoes were smeared pink in the shoes and he pushed the shoes on the rug like a car race. The cleanup in the snow with other cats he took from his hat.
1,terrible,I don't know how people could give this book 5 stars and write about how this book sends a good message to children. This book is disturbing. The use of guns and the rhymes about killing are inappropriate for any age. That combined with the pink splotchy snow creates the imagery of a war zone. Don't buy this book. Get one of the other ones.
5,A very good book,"I have been at a seder for several years where every participant was given a copy of this book for the night, in addition to whatever varied haggaddot they brought. Every year i thought this was a great idea. I recommend trying this at home! About the book: The pictures are lovely, and it really does act as a good companion to a standard Passover haggadda. This book tries to revitalize the stories and add new facts and perspectives. This is worth buying!"
3,A resource for those new to Passover,I'm not sure if this book is intended to be a Passover Haggadah or not. It is divided into two sections. The first section contains the story of Moses leading the Jewish people out of slavery in Egypt. The second section breaks the Sedar (or Passover dinner) into 14 sections and gives a short description of each one.Though this is probably not an authentic Haggadah it would be helpful to Christian families wanting to learn more about Passover and how to observe the holiday with their children. I think it would make a valuable resource in your personal library.
5,wonderful and warm-your-heart movie,this is a great movie. very enjoyable. i love it and wish more people could enjoy it like me.
4,Excellent look at a typical individual power,We had seen all these before but wanted to see and enjoy them again and share them with family and friends.
5,Such a Great Movie,"Living near the Colorado New Mexico border, I like to watch this to remind me of the magic of living in this area. I have read the book and the movie adds the sparkle of music. I had the VHS for years until that player finally bit the dust, and this is one of my first 'replacement' DVDs."
5,The Milagro Beanfield War,I originally saw this movie when it debuted in the theaters. It is a wonderful story about the poor land owners in New Mexico being swindled out of their land by a rich developer. It was photographed in Northern New Mexico where the skies are blue and the country scenes are beautiful. I was so happy to find this movie available in DVD format.I believe anybody that views this movie will certainly enjoy it and have empathy for the poor guy being taken advantage by the big rich guy.
5,good story telling,"A wonderful story, well told. Captures the beauty of Northern New Mexico, the truth about the people of the land and just a good tale. The native tale mixed with a reality of changing society. Great video to watch and ponder."
4,"Delightful relaxation experience, one of my favoriites.","This has long been one of my favorite movies for a relaxing evening at home.Just enough action, humor and suspense to keep me interested and an exceptional setting. The story is timely and the casting is perfect!Redford hit a home run here."
5,Milagro Still Charms,"I have been searching for this film on dvd for some time. I was happy to find it on Amazon. They shipped it to my parent's home and we all enjoyed this ""slightly mystical"" comedy/drama set in New Mexico. The film has lost none of its charm over the years."
4,Land of Enchantment,"I love watching this old movie because I travel to New Mexico a lot. I bought my floor loom in Chimayo, just down the road from where this was filmed. Mew Mexico gets in your soul and this movie just captures the beauty and history of it's people in a fun way. Generations of hard working people who sometimes barely make ends meet live in these mountains."
4,This song Rocks!,"This song is great, I own it and I can't wait for her full lenght CD to come out. If her new songs are half as good as her first single then, then it will be one of the best selling CDs ever"
1,could not get it to work,This has great potential with loads of information available in an interactive format but there are flaws. I could not get the program to run right. Even when trying the helpful suggestion provided to work out the bugs the interactive video portions would not run. I spent a lot of money on this and wanted to use it for review before I took the NCLEX exam. I am glad that I did not limit my review to only this CD.
5,Excellent Shirt,"I ordered the 100% cotton Rothco shirts in Desert Sand and Foliage. While not quite Beefy-T weight, they are decent weight and fit great.Most importantly, they are LONG! THANK YOU! Finally a t-shirt that fits tall people (I ordered XL).Neck is nice, not snug but not sloppy. Shirt is appropriate width for my shoulders. Will definitely order more.I also ordered the ""heavyweight"" poly/cotton shirt in olive drab. Doesn't seem so heavy too me. Think I'll stick with 100% cotton."
3,This is one of those shirts...,"That will keep its look and not stretch, it is also a Communist symbol so some Europeans my take offense to the Cold War reference. Some girl I dated stole this because she has a star thing, she could keep it...the Commy!"
3,OK T-shirt,"These T-shirts are alright, just not great . They are light weight rather than the mid weight advertised. They are cotton/poly blend and are almost see through they are so light weight. I'll use them but, I won't buy any more of these due to the fact that I feel they won't hold up under working conditions."
2,underwear only,"This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled, a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer. I won't buy again."
2,Very loose fit requires tubes,The tires appear functional but I haven't been able to use them yet. They arrived very squished and compressed. This means they fit VERY loosely on the rims which prevents setting the bead. I now have to purchase tubes in order to use these tires. (There was no chance at using a compressor to set the bead and the starter fluid trick sure didn't work!)
1,Wrong Picture,"There's no way the tire illustrated in this picture is a 20 x 8 x 8. I would never buy this, because I wouldn't know what they would ship to me."
4,really fun!,"If you've been reading the various ""Mars"" science fiction novels that have come out in the past 10 yrs or so, this is a really fun book to read. I enjoyed it much more than the recent entries by Zubrin, Landis, or even Kim Stanley Robinson. However, in addition to the criticisms others have raised here about typos and editing, one other thing Cronin would have benefited from is to have a real Mars geologist give the book a read, before it was published. There are some real errors in the geology. For one thing, no dunes on Mars move as fast as those in Cronin's story, and quartz is practically nonexistant. (dunes hardly move at all under the present climate conditions). Regardless, a really fun book that I only wish was taken to that next level (some editing for typos, and a *Mars* geologist's input)."
3,Good,"This book is good for the story of Henry Adams and Clarence King and John Hay which I became interested in after seeing them frequently mentioned in Theodore Roosevelt biographies, but fans of TR will be troubled by some of the out of place criticisms of him, as in the authors next book ""When Trumpets Call"" she has a decided animosity towards him, like when she criticizes him for for not ""facilitating genius"" when being painted by John Singer Sargent like John Hay did, a man of ""refined tastes"" and about ""whining"" about time taken from his daily fencing matches. I don't know what her problem is but she clearly doesn't understand TR at all."
1,Never worked,"This was my third brew n go. The first two lasted years this one never worked from the day I got it. I called Black and Decker and they told me they were out of stock, I would have to write them a letter, send in the plug, and hope to get one some day. I threw it away and said I would never buy one of their products again."
3,taste terrible,"had it for two years. Good thing is it is still working.While taste is terrible , you might stand it if you are not serious coffee drinker."
3,"Decent, but messy.","The coffee made by this was fine, but the ""no buying filters"" angle basically means it has a filter in it that must be washed out. Hence, it's a pain to clean. I've switched to an old garage sale Mr. Coffee maker with paper filters and am now thoroughly happy. Fine for a single-cup-swilling person who doesn't mind cleaning a filter (it's worse than it sounds- wet coffee grounds stick to everything)."
1,Company failed to give me 2 mugs.,I bought this item because it said it came with 2 mugs but only came with one.
1,A Very Hard Game,"Yoshi Touch and Go is a very BAD game. It is very short. You can probably beat it in less than an hour. The graphics arn't great (about the same as the Gameboy). The main thing I dont like about this game is that there is no freedom. Yoshi moves along and all you do is draw a path of clouds for him to walk on with you stylus.The reason why this game is hard because, Basicly the game is one long level. In this level yoshi walks automaticly along the world on a path of clouds drawn by you. If Yoshi falls off, your dead. If he touches an enemy, your dead. what would really suck is if you were about to finish the game and you died. GAME OVER you would have to start from the begining again..and again...and again.Take my advise...DO NOT BUY ""YOSHI TOUCH AND GO"" EVEN IF IT WAS A PENNY!!! Get Super Mario 64 DS or Goldeneye Rouge Adgent Instead of this load of crap."
1,this game stinks big time,this is one of the whorst games I have ever played it is a stupid arcade game yoshi is so cool but this game made yoshi look sooooooooooooo stupid I am so mad I cant do this anymore have a good day unless you got yoshi touch and go then have a rotten day
2,yoshi rocks not,"Yoshi touch and go sounds like a neat title. But no. I had the brains not to buy one because my approach was ""Whoopdee-doo another 2d side scrolling game"" I mean, come on Nintendo DS has amazing potentiol if you just utilized its power and didn't base games on your budget. Thanks for reading my review."
4,A great Addition to the Yoshi Series,"This game is a lot of fun. It takes advantage of the touch screen very well. I have to admit this game is difficult, but the more you play it the better you get at it. Yoshi Touch and Go has 5 awesome modes which are all a blast. The modes are Score Attack, Marathon Mode (my favorite), Time Attack, VS. (multiplayer), and Challenge. It is so creative how you draw clouds and throw eggs, all using the touch screen. I haven't tried Yoshi's Island DS yet, but since this game is so good I want to try it. I got this game for $19.99, which is an awesome deal for a game this great. Try to find this game used somewhere. It's hard to find it because it was one of the first DS games available. Great for all ages!!!"
3,Decent Game,"Yoshi Touch and Go is a great game for the Nintendo DS, which offers ' simple ' gameplay, that any kid can do. It sounds simple, but it isn't as easy as it seems. You take the roll of Yoshi and Baby mario, and guide them alone with a path of clouds, and shoot enemies and other stuff with Yoshi's eggs. There are 5 gameplay modes to play, all of which different in some way. This is a great game, but it just doesn't have depth. The graphics are great for a Yoshi handheald game and all, the controls are simple enough, it's just that there isn't a story. You play the same level over and over again until you can just keep rebeating your records; which is not the funnest of all things to do. So, this is a great rental, but not worth a buy unless you like repetetiveness.Graphics: 5/5Sound: 4/5Control: 4/5Fun: 3.5/5Even though I give this game straight 3's, it is just about the best game out right now for the DS."
3,Fun but not enough levels,"I looked forward to playing this game, hoping it would have many levels to solve, like in Super Mario Bros. I was disappointed that there were only a few things to solve, if you could call it solving something. It's really just getting high scores to unlock a couple of other levels. The game is fun, though. I just wish there was more to it. The amount of money you have to pay for this game is really not worth the gameplay they give you, in my opinion. I only played for a few hours a few different days, unlocked two levels, and then had to put the game away."
3,This toy is good.,THis game is ok but isnt the best ds game you can get.It is fun but kind of boring.I dont think you should get this game.
3,FUN BUT NOT GOOD.,THIS GAME IS FUN WHEN YOU BUY IT BUT WHEN KEEP PLAYING IT. IT GETS LESS FUN. BUT I LIKE THE PLAYING TWO PLAYERS. SO ONLY IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOU ARE NOT PLANING TO USE IT BUY THIS GAME. BUT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY DO IT. PB WWC
3,Yoshi Touch and Go buy this great game!,"Yoshi Touch and Go is a fun, simple, and awesome!In the first stage, you have to guide baby mario through the sky to reach yoshi on the groundIn the 2nd stage, you guide yoshi who is carrying baby mario as far as you can through jungles, caves, canyons, and other themed areas.Yoshi Touch and Go is more of an old fashined arcadey ""get the highest score"" kind of game, but is fun for people who stink at video games, and people who are more experianced.It is perfect for little kids who get scared of scary opponents and bosses (just like i used to be).I love this game!"
3,"Unofficially ""ooky""","Stephen Cox has also researched and written about ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""The Munsters,"" so you've got to know he's a hard-core fan of classic -- and quirky? -- TV. Besides the basic behind-the-scenes stuff, Cox here offers a short chapter on each of the major stars of the show (with photos and filmography), along with an overview of the merchandise associated with the show, other tidbits like the love poetry of Gomez and Morticia, and a chapter containing a brief synopsis of each episode."
5,One of the best mint teas I've found,"It's too bad Celestial Seasonings has discontinued this product since it's one of the best and most original mint teas I've ever found -- spicy but not too spicy or cinnamony like so many Celestial teas, blended harmoniously with black tea, and decaf so you can drink it before bed. I ordered two cases, but odds are when I finish the last box it'll be the last I'll ever get to taste."
5,A Cat's Meow of a Book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! As the owner--or should I say housemate--of four cats, ranging in age from 3 to 20 years, I can honestly say that Ron and Eva have captured the true spirit of cats in this book. Heart-warming, entertaining and funny! I especially loved the chapter, ""Mouse in the House"". Been there, done that! I laughed right out loud--did that a lot while reading this book.Great insight to why we love these furry creatures and how much they add to our lives.I give this book five meows!!!"
4,Insightful!,"Authors Charles C. Poirier and Stephen E. Reiter envision a trip down your supply chain like an effortless sail on calm seas. Your organization can reach this placid efficiency, they explain, by forming partnerships with suppliers and others in your business network. But the authors don't ask you to take their word; instead they present detailed case studies of companies that have implemented supply-chain optimization strategies and reaped prodigious benefits. The book's only flaw is its style. It is densely written and often weighed down by prose as murky as a rural delivery system and twice as difficult to penetrate. But we [...] recommend that business owners, corporate managers, executives and logisticians of all levels take the time required to patiently excavate the practical and pragmatic information that lies within."
4,"Portland, Oregon Drink Mixer","My doctor prescribed a healthier diet for me after my annual checkup came back with a red flag flying. So, I said goodbye to those sugar cereals and bought my Faberware FDM300 drink mixer as my first step to eating healthier. Now, every morning I make smoothies containing fresh fruits and yougurt and it works like a charm! I am very pleased with this product and would not trade it for anything! It is very easy to clean, fast, and efficent."
1,Broken on in the box,I received my pruner in a huge box that would fit a flat panel TV. With all that packing the scissor part at the end was broken (probably because the connection sleeve to the aluminum pole is plastic. Then I noticed the razor sharp blade is exposed where it could slice a deep cut if brushed against. Now I feel I'm stuck with this thing. I don't know if I have the patience to repackage and return it. It will end up in the landfill. Think twice before you buy.
4,"Funny, Physical Comedy","I am not sure why this movie is getting so many bad reviews.What I Can Tell You: I have seen all the Big Momma Movies and still crack up when I see Martin Lawrence as Momma/Malcolm. Come on, too funny. Lawrence and Jackson are funny together. My favorite scenes were any that Jackson had to act like a chick with hot dorm girls walking around in towels. Classic comedy at its best. A dude in drag, done a hundred times, but still funny. Oh, and I have got to mention Momma does nude modeling. Hahahaha...hysterical.Although I missed Nia Long, as Malcolm's girlfriend I thought as far as a third attempt goes, this was funny.This is obviously not an Oscar worthy movie, but, if what you are looking for is a good time, a few laughs at hidden identity and some physical comedy, this is a good choice."
5,Big mama dvd,Received very timely. I was in a hurry to get this DVD as I had just heard about it. Very pleased with the product.
4,Another BIG Momma Movie,Funny as expected. Good to see Martin Lawrence still in the movie scene. A nice movie to include in your collections if you are a fan of comedy.
5,A gift for my granddaugter.,"This was a gift for my grand daughter. So I have not watched it, But she has. I have not heard any complaints so it must have been OK. I can say it was ver fast shipping and I would order from again."
2,Threes a crowd!,"In search of entertainment, I chose to continue the 1st two ""Big Mama's"" by purchasing the last. BIG Mistake! More of a musical with teenagers, with a light love interest with the younger actor. Sad to see Martin Lawrence have to stoop so low as to act in a seemingly low budget flick like this one.It followed in the fashion of ""American Pie"" making WAY TOO MANY of what started out as a good thing."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It was so boring I fell asleep during the movie. Maybe if I watch it a few times it will grow on me, but for now...I prefer Big Momma's House parts 1 and 2."
4,Big Momma in the house,Not too many great comedians out there like there used to be. Glad to see Martin is still at it.
3,But my 6y/o would rate it a 10!,Our 6y/o son LOVES this movie! He watches daily after school and on the weekends--forget it! But it's a fairly funny movie; I enjoy sitting and watching it with my son; I create teachable moments like a book/movie review.
5,Absolute pleasure,"What an absolutely lovely settings for this popular book! Glen Roven proves it's possible to make 21st century children take interest in serious music, if you only do it the right way...! The combination of Roven's music, Shapira's wonderful execution and Shields' stardust is a winner both for kids and grownups."
5,Excitement on the money,"If you're a fan of Griffin, Higgins, Huston, Ludlum, Robinson or Patterson, add Gerald Staub to your list. It's a well researched work (I'm personally familiar with most of the locations in his book. Staub gently coaxes you into the story and ratchets up the tension. Almost without knowing, you'll find yourself fully involved, sucked into the plot, characters and events. The lawn will not get mowed, the dishes not done until the final page.Staub has done an excellent job opening a window on a Jihad. More pointedly, to a horribly viable scenario given the resources, committment and fervor behind this Jihad."
2,doc in louisiana ... Aroma Grill remade,"First, let me state I didn't buy this grill from Amazon. Second, I almost ordered this product until I saw the name of the manufacturer (Salton) ... another Aroma Grill. Gee, I got mine a year ago. It came in 20 parts, I glued them back together. The seller and Salton would do nothing about it! Well, since then, let me put it this way ... the teflon wore out to bare metal on about half the grill in 3 months. Even when the teflon was intact, things stuck, to the point that half a steak was left on the grill one night. A night's worth of soaking didn't even lift it. Yes, I did everything according to the directions, however this grill has never worked for me. Ok, so now it's George Foreman's grill ... I bought it as Aroma Grill, and I'm definitely not taking another chance. Once the name Salton is applied, I know it is inferior ... just one widower's opinion."
2,Not Available?,"How can I rate a product you show and it isn't available to be purchased. I think it looks like an awesome gill kit perfect for a party or great for a gift. However, since I can't purchase this at your special price, I can't truly put a rating on this item.I would consider this false advertising to lure people into your site and then find out this item can't be purchased!I was excited when I saw this nice gill, looks like A very useable size for a weekend cookout with family & friends.I just had a birthday & a friend sent me some money to purchase ""A George Foreman Grill"". Now, I'm not so sure what I want after seeing this item. Possibly, I can find it somewhere...IF I LOOK LONG ENOUGH!!Thanks for the viewing access. However, I am not interested at this time since your featured item is not available.MM :-)"
4,Great Job,I like the food cooked on this grill. Items cook quickly and are tender when done. Rather large and bulky but worth the storage problem. Cleans easily.
4,"Delicate flavor, supposedly good for bone health","I purchased this product after reading that white tea helps build bone mass. I have osteoporosis, so I thought I would give it a try. I drink tea frequently, mostly Earl Grey and chamomile. I could not find white tea locally, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price..This tea has a delicate, flower like flavor that is unusual enough for some variety in my tea drinking routine. I am pleased with my purchase."
3,Great as an Ice Tea,"I had to update my review because I started making ice tea with these bags and the taste is awesome! with a little lemon. ""Try it, you'll like it"""
5,"Excellent flavor, environmentally-friendly packaging",We ordered this from Amazon because it is so difficult to purchase decaf white tea locally. Excellent flavor. We appreciate that the tea is in bags without the strings. Box flap explains 'bag only' as it is less material for land fills. This is a recommended product.
4,A How to Manual for Developing and Maintaining a Brand,"Effective brand managers have been doing this stuff all along, they've just been doing it as an art not a process. Brand Asset Management details how to build a process to develop a brand, assess its health, and support business strategy.The brand and its management have implications well beyond marketing and sales, so Davis argues that brand management is the responsibility of all in the enterprise -it's about much more than techniques used by the brand manager. The brand should inform and drive decisions in product development, pricing, human resources, and business strategy.Brand Asset Management is so prescriptive that it sometimes reads like a checklist, and some will find it best used as a manual capturing all the steps to developing and maintaining a brand."
1,Pure Spin. Recycled material at best.,"This book is more of the same rehashed, recycled, repurposed content from the authors. Much of this material is available in any basic marketing text. In fact, this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding. If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y&R;, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. The ""editorial reviews"" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as ""cases"" in the book.Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called ""thought leadership"", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking. Save your money. Don't become a victim of Prophet's propoganda. Buy something with substance like Jean Noel Kapferer."
1,Boring and non-specific,"This is another ""lead generation"" piece for the branding agency (Prophet) but unlike some of David Aaker's earlier books which are truly innovative and helpful, this one is a dead fish. Don't waste your time."
5,BOYS WILL BE BOYS ( YEA RIGHT ),THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.THERE IS A BIG DRUG AND SEX PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
2,plot was predictable,I liked this movie but I also didn't like it.the story line was very predictable. I saw a similar movie of true movies.the acting was fairly good. it does go to show how ignorant people are when it comes to Rape.after watching this movie I realise why many rapes go unreported.
3,Classic Made for TV Movie,"If you love slightly cheesy Lifetime-style made-for-TV movies, this is a good one to add to your collection! My favorites have former Saved by the Bell or Beverly Hills 90210 cast members, so this one has both. Brian Austin Green was such a geek on 90210 but he really grew into a hottie - if you're a fan of his you'll love this movie! Tiffani Amber Thiessen plays the lead role, looking like the SBtB College Years version of Kelly. This movie isn't Oscar-worthy art, but it's good entertainment. The DVD contains the movie only - no special features. Parents should probably review content advisories before purchasing since the movie is about rape and depicts sexually active high school students and underage drinking. As far as I remember, BAG is shown with no shirt on and TAT is shown in her underwear in some scenes."
2,"Good, but not quite the book I was looking for.","A large portion of the book is dedicated to the history, design, and evolution of the PC. While it seems well written and is interesting, it is not particularly important to the topic of the book which is PC-based instrumentation and control. A little less than half the book (chapters 8-13) seems to be dedicated to the topic and is not as detailed as the first half the book which is not really on topic."
1,Useless book for practical purposes,Purely theoretical book. It very very little to C and C++ and the example is of a key board input. Being the book about instrumentation and control this is seems totally off.This book is USELESS for practical purposes. If I wanted history and theory of pc instrumentation I would have gone to wikipedia.What a waste of money.
2,Out Dated Book,This book is out of date. There's no mention of the USB serial interface or how to use it for PC-based instrumentation in this book. I should have bought a newer edition.
5,DELL P992 Monitor,"I have been using this monitor at 1024 x 768 resolution and have found picture quality to be sharp and very detailed. I am really impressed with photos taken using my FUJI S602ZOOM using the Finepix Viewer as a slideshow.This CRT monitor is a bargain as they are becoming less popular due to Dell's 19"" FP TFTs. I have been given to understand that text can be 'fuzzy' on the TFTs and can honestly say I have never experienced any 'fuzzyness' with this superb CRT.Image is stable and sharp.....a quality product from DELL.I will wait for a while when TFTs become cheaper and DELL have ironed out the 'fuzzy' problem with text."
2,"Dell, Compaq, and Retail","I use to use this 19"" monitor at 1280x1024 but it started to get way too blurry so I scaled down to 1024x768. The monitor isn't very bright. The monitor at work is amazingly crisp to where I can easily read text at 1280x1024 with the Compaq's 17"" monitor. I'm now rebuilding my home system using all retail components (retail components, not system). I'm saving a lot of money and I can kiss dell drivers and OEM hardware problems goodbye. The dirty secret is that OEM means that it didn't pass quality tests to be retail."
4,A little big but worth it,I bought the gray gradient 37 ones. They are a bit big even for my somewhat large face (these are fashion sunglasses) and a bit curved (gives a minor fish-eye look) but they are great driving or active sunglasses.I bought these because they were the only decent pair with thin handles. I was getting a sunburn that darkened parts of my face so I was looking for thin frames and this was the best one I could find.
3,looks great,these look great but are polycarbonate lenses not glass..made in china..saw a similar one in sunglass hut in glass...a smaller design...way better ...these almost look fake
3,Not RayBan Finest,"I have the Polarized versions and they are made in Italy. These glasses are very light and I forget they are there while this may be a positive for most its a negative for me. I find them annoying as I prefer gray neutral lens. Mine are polarized brown and get little face time. The lens are plastic. I also have the RB 3025 Silver mirror GSM classic aviators in Polarized form and those are by far the best raybans ever followed by the RB 5024 black Classic Wayfarers, then Maui Jim Sunsets. The bubble wrap comes in handy as clasic aviators let in a lot of side glare. When the sunset or sunrise is to my right or left I throw these on if the suns overhead I wear the classics. I drive 150 miles every day so I need polarized lens."
5,It's great experience,"It's fantastic experience for purchasing at AMAZON as Chinese. It's great and I'll put AMAZON as my search way and checking standard as I want to buy something. Thanks AMAZON!¿ÉÒÖÄ? ÚAMAZONòÜÓÈ, Òó¿áÀ'""ÀÑäÍ""Ä."
3,Not All Ray Bans Made in Italy,Not sure why you think real Ray Bans are made only in Italy. I bought a pair at Nordstrom and there were made in China. I suppose Nordstrom could be selling fakes but I doubt it...
1,Not satisfied with the product,"I bought this item for my boyfriend birthday. He was upset with this product because it made from China, as I'm concerned the original rayban made from Italy or US. I feel that I'm been cheated. I'm not recommend it to others."
2,not great,"not accurate, this is a good deck for those that need sugar coated readings. cards are too big and stiff and hard to shuffle."
4,Beautiful Cards,I have found these Oracle cards a beauty to behold as well as inspiring to use - they are a great sustenance if used according to the author's guidelines and in the spirit in which they are meant.
1,I am happy to stand corrected but...,"...I am a great Doreen Virtue fan on the whole, but I simply can't help thinking that she is simply regurgitating all the information and thoughts and insights we have heard before, in this pack. For me it is a case of re-packaging what has already been said a million times. The pictures are sweet enough, and very colourful, but I would stick to some of her other cards like the Archangel cards...I feel Doreen has simply thought"" Hmmm what mystical icon can I put on this new set to re-sell as something new "". I am cynical, but can't help thinking she is laughing all the way up her beautifully tailored sleeve as she checks her bank account."
2,Magical Mermaids and Dolphin Oracle Cards,This set of cards have been used only once.I need to use it more before I can give ita fair review.
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"I own four other decks by Doreen Virtue and really enjoy working with them. For some reason, though, I cannot connect with this deck no matter how I try. The artwork is not terribly inspiring, either. Perhaps the guidance suggested by the cards is too discordant - that's the only thing I've come up with. Anyway, I'll make a few more attempts with this deck, but I would highly recommend Doreen's Goddess deck over this one to anyone trying to decide. I wasn't sure how I felt about the Goddess deck at first but we have since bonded! It's a wonderful option."
3,Not Her Best.,"I love Doreen Virtue's work. I also love Mermaids. However, this deck was a let down. The reason is that it seems as if this deck was thrown together haphazardly, in regards to the artwork. It is inconsistent, and while that in and of itself isn't a big deal, the artwork seems amateurish. With the abundance of beautiful Mermaid artowrk out there, I have a hard time believing Ms. Virtue and the publishers couldn't have found more appealing artwork. The oracle readings itself aren't her best inspirational work to date.I would recommend her Archangel Oracle deck instead- more love and thought was put into that deck, it's simply beautiful, and the readings seem to come from a Higher Knowing."
5,the most gorgeous cards,"I just received my cards this morning. Way earlier than the shipment stated they would come in the mail. They are absolutely breathtaking. I looked and each and every card and I just an enamoured at the lovely display of detail and care put into creating these cards. Doreen Virtue is fantastic and I love her books and oracle cards. I highly suggest if you are into mermaids, dolphins and not looking for a traditional type of tarot deck; then these cards are perfect. They give good readings and you get exactly what you need to hear when you need to hear it! Highly advise these cards to join your oracle collection!!!!!!!!! These are my most favorite cards ever!!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy."
5,Impressive,"I found these cards to be quite impressive for being simple oracle cards rather than detailed tarot cards. They give accurate readings and are easy for the beginner of using precognative cards and are still fun for the experience tarot card reader. The artwork is absolutely stunning and two of the card's artwork was done by a favorite artist of mine, Jonathon Earl Bowser, (see jonathonart.com) All in all this is worth the money it's priced at. Definitely a good buy. Also check out Doreen Virtue's, Healing With The Fairies Oracle Cards. That deck is equally impressive. Also, if anyone would like advice or help on interpreting oracle or tarot cards, please don't hesitate to email me. (surfinsurfergirl@yahoo.com)"
5,Dancer,Very nice these are great as tree ornaments or stand alone decoration. I used them for inexpensive gifts for family and loved ones.
4,buddha-bar star,"The artists on the album are wonderful, as are most of the words and music of most of the selections. It's great that ""My Funny Valentine"" was thrown into the mix of unusual and off-beat pieces. My one complaint is that I'm unable to find albums by the artists I fell in love with -- in particular. Manuel Franjo, Erica Jennings and Medea. Who and where are they?"
3,cafe del mar-like,"very nice little cd, in the same style as cafe del mar series, very relaxing, to enjoy late in the evening, or with a sunset-view.however, cafe del mar addicts might find it a little bit not ""rich"" enough in sound.so, like cafe del mar, but not as good as cafe del mar."
2,What am I missing?,"Oh, man, what am I missing that the other reviewers of this cd find so compelling?Trilling and whistling synthesizers going ""woooo-oooooo"" and ""ahhhhh-aaaaaa"" while the singer chants the same words over and over and over and over and over (get it?)... Like this:do you love me, too?do you love me, too?(woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo)do you love me, too?do you love me, too?(woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo)do you love me, too?do you love me, too?(woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo)do you love me, too?do you love me, too?(woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo, woooo-oooooo)I love youdo you love me, too?etc. for 4:20Did somebody say chill? This cd is making my hair stand on end! Did somebody say dance? I've heard that people make love to this kind of music, but I think I'd be too busy laughing and would lose my focus...Forget it."
1,"Ethan Frome: Great Idea, Poor Execution","When Edith Wharton wrote ""Ethan Frome"" she was living in Europe. In my opinion, she was a little home-sick and wished to set a story, any story, near where she lived, so she created Starkfeild, the town, under several feet of snow, where Ethan, his Wife (Zeena), and his supposed ""true love"" (Mattie) live together. After reading the book, I got the impression that Ethan didn't truely love either Zeena or Mattie, and so the ""daring escape"" from his life that he tries to make doesn't seem realistic. Although Wharton idea for this story was grade ""A"", she made Ethan seem to be lusting after Mattie, as opposed to truely loving her. This book could have been much better and about eighty pages shorter."
2,Not what I ordered.,I was very disappointed because the hoodie does not match the picture. This was supposed to be a pullover hoodie and when shipped it is a Zip front hoodie. I also felt it was not good quality fabric...rather stiff. Overall very disappointed.
2,Not what it seems,"This game is not as satisfying as the NBA Live... I think they need to upgrade this game her a bit more.Only good part about this game is when you're playing ""My Live"" you get to create a player and play but still got to play under commands. If I had another choice, I would buy the NBA Live or ESPN over this one"
3,It's OK,"This game is OK. None of the teams have an overall of 80 or more. The Best Teams are the Knicks, Mavericks,Heat, and Spurs. The Lakers suck. The only person good on the team is Kobe Bryant and Maurice Evans."
5,Revolutionary.,"I shouldn't have to tell you this, but go buy this game system. If you had to decide between a Playstation and an N64 there is no doubt I'd buy an N64. With at least 30-40 revolutionary titles and also being one of the first ""3D"" consoles I'd say if you don't have this system or didn't in the past you simply did not have a childhood. In my opinion the 90s was the best decade of ALL TIME. And it's because of this right here, thank you Japan, thank you Nintendo. You can get this for about $20 used. Seriously?! That's insanely cheap for something this great. BUY IT. NOW."
5,best system ever,"i have got to say that nintendo had outdone themselves when the nintendo 64 first came out into the stores. this system has graphics that really looks like your in the game when your you play it. when i saw the commertials, i went to the stores and bought me the first one. If i could i would give this game 999,999,999,999,999stars. THIS GAME RULZ!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nintendo 64,"Gaming system works fine and was received on time, felt like I overpaid for it though. Said very good condition and it had scratches and cracks all over it when I received it."
5,Favorite Console of All Time,"I think most people can agree with me that this is arguably the best console of all time. The games are awesome, and still today, in 2010, I love this console more than my Xbox 360, or my Wii. The games just never get old, and I love it. Thanks Nintendo, for making this masterpiece."
4,amazing,"this is a very fun console,although the system is outdated the games are still really fun.the really good games are nintendo made like super mario 64 or paper mario."
1,"""Like New""","Where do I start with the overall disappointment. Let's start with the packaging with something this big I expected it to be in a box, once receiving my envelope with rips and tears all over I was very irritated with the lack of care from the seller. Once opening the package I was at least relieved to see that all the contents were inside of it. After getting the contents out and inspecting them I was wondering how I bought something ""like new"" with scratches, dents , and the controller has a very lose analogue stick. Once I power up the system it did work which is surprising with all of disappointment that was brought on before."
3,late and incomplete,"product was a week overdue and a game short. still have not received game. was supposed to be a christmas present, arrived at end of december (ordered 12/5). had to e-mail inquiries of whereabouts of product."
5,"Nintendo 64 : Old, But Still Good.....","The N64 may be old, but it has great graphics. Yes, it doesn't have such good graphics as the GC, PS2, OR XBOX, but if you like to collect (or just like) old consoles, you will find the graphics amazing!PROS:- Great graphics for an old system (1996-2001)!- Great games like Mario, Pokemon Stadium, Zelda, and more!- Cool Controller!- You can still buy the games (USED) for it at video game shops!Cons:- Outdated System- You need a lot of accessories (Memory card, rumble pack if you want the rumbling feature, expansion pack for specific games like Zelda. etc.)- Small selection of games (most are sports)This system is great! If you want one, get one at your local video game store today or buy it at amazon.com used!"
1,n64,The items that they said came with it did not come with it.The product description said console hookups and controllers.They sent just console. When I contacted them they said I was lying about it.
3,Golden eye,"Goldeneye is a great game it held my interest for the continuance of the game, but sadly it is the only game on the n64 I consider ""great"", i just dont buy into the kiddie games, as much of the n64 games are, I suggest you buy a Dreamcast, and hold out on the n64, unless your buying it for a child."
5,LOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,"I HEART THE N64!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's the BEST console of ALL TIME!!!!!! XBOX might have better graphics, but the 64 has better games! Ports for 4 PLAYERS!!!??? Most of the GC games are just remade N64 classics. The ONLY thing i can tell you is....[drumroll]..... BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask,this game is good mostly because it is not a RPG game (Ya you might like RPG games but trust me i had played tons of RPG's games and i not going to change my opinion.)it is a action-puzzle.NOTE:this game somtimes gets sorta crazy.
4,mario cart 64,"This is my favorite game nintendo 64. It combines the flavor of super nintendo with the pizazz of 64. You are a one of mario's cool buds as you race through different courses for a chance to win the gold cup! If you ever see this game in the store, go out and buy it!"
4,Great,"I own both a PSX and a N64. I can honestly say that the N64 beats the PSX hands down, yet I do like the variety and inexpensiveness of PSX games. If companies such as SqaureSoft had stuck with Nintendo, those award winning games FF VII and Parasite Eve could have been a lot better. If you had to choose between the two for a present, the N64 would be the way to go, or you could wait a few months and get the Dolphin. It would be well worth it."
2,truthful review!,"it really hurts to say anything bad about nintendo but this system sucks! theres only a few good games like goldeneye,mario,donkey kong and a VERY FEW others the thing that hurts me the most is where is the ROLEPLAYING GAMES! and no zelda isnt a roleplaying game and another big issue is why are the graphics so blurry I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS SYSTEM A CHANCE BECAUSE IS NINTENDO IS A VERY TALENTED COMPANY I KNOW THAT THEY WILL FIX ALLTHESE PROBLEMS FOR THE DOLPHIN BUT UNTIL THEN STAY CLEAR OF THIS DISSAPOINTING MACHINE!"
5,Awsome!,It's in new condition with 11 games 2 controlers and 2 memory packs it's clean and works really well. it is very well taken care of and will work great for everyone and itt comes with all the cables so you can play it. it's selling for $300.00
1,N64+controller,"Kind of disappointed. The Nintendo itself is fine, but I chose this one because it came with a controller. The controller was a generic piece of junk. The wiring is bad so the game deck keeps saying the controller is not plugged in, and the plastic cap on the joystick keeps falling off. And I have to mention that its shape isn't even close to an N64 controller. Big, uncomfortable and bulky. Thanks for nothing!"
3,OLD,"N64 is old. It uses large, expensive cartirages. Another bad thing about it is that it dosen't tale advantage of is graphical ability. I have seen many psx games look better that many n64 games. Nentendo brags about thier system having such a graphical advantage over ps, but it dosen't show that(well it does in 4 games). One big advantage it has over ps is that it has 4 controler ports. But still ps and dc are better."
4,Good system with great games,"The N64 has some of the absolute greatest games ever made. I love the look of it and the zero load-times of the cartridge games. That being said, it has one of the most flawed first-party controllers ever made. I like the layout, but there seems to be a lot of friction in the analog stick. Every N64 controller have ever owned has a significantly degenerated analog stick."
5,retro gaming at its best,"my kids have been wanting to replace this forever, just got it the other day and they are really enjoying it. came packed really well and with all the pieces."
3,"Games Overpriced, And are not sold at very many places...","<b>This is an OK system, its not great the games are overpriced, and the system itself is.</b> The dreamcast has 128 bit graphics and thos only had 64 and dreamcast is only 50. the games for dreamcast are also only 10 bucks. If you want realy real fun try Sega Genesis ( Its a classic, has the best games, but As you may know the graphics are a little..... whats the word.... (old)... But overall i give this system 3 stars. I got this system 5 years ago, and stoped playing it about 3 years ago.. I play it evryonce in a while for breif times. PS2 and Genesis are awesome compared to this. However this is just my opinion!"
3,"Okay, but could be better.","This console is old, but it's pretty good for when it came out. But now, however, I think I probably reccomend a newer console."
2,Highly overrated,"The Nintendo 64 may have more power than the PlayStation, but there're two things that kill it in the long run: Games and Carts. CDs are much better than cartriges due to cost and ability to hold data. Wonder why Playstation games are 20-30 bucks cheaper than N64 games? CDs. The discs themselves cost only $4, but cartriges are much more expensive. And as for games, N64 may have Bond, Zelda and some other great games, but the PSX has MANY more great games. If you have neither, save up and wait for PlayStation2 or Dreamcast."
3,.,"There were a few nail polish stains and the extension pak/jumper pak lid was missing and the bottom was broken a bit, but the console works fine so it's all good."
2,beat up and bad shape,So I didnt realize this was only for the console and didn't include any cords. but anyways this thing was pretty beat up. I wish the seller would've at least let me know about that first. but we are still yet to fire it up since we don't have the cords or anything. i'm sure it works but still.
2,Nintendo 64 console with controller,I bought this as a gift for someone who used to have one years ago and wanted another. The console was in great shape but the controller was broken. So how is he supposed to to use it? The backward button doesn't work. Amazon should make sure that the sellers are trustworthy before connecting their name to them. VERY disappointing!!
2,"So much hype, so much sad.","Length:: 0:51 MinsI was so excited when I first ordered my favorite old game console. I waited for 2 weeks before it got here, and when it did, I was ecstatic. That is, until I opened it. When I ordered it, I was expecting a nice N64 with all the required attachments, controllers and connector cables . What I got was a beat up old box that looked like it was thrown against a wall, with a stuck reset button. I suggest that the seller update their Product Description with ""Nintendo 64, Console Only"". That would save a lot of people a lot of time and 23 bucks."
1,What Happened?,"I can honestly say I have been severely let down by the false promises of a ""fun"" machine. Nintendo's reputation has always been most admired by myself, until this atrocity. The games are very disapointing in terms of depth and playability and the graphics for a ""superior"" system are apalling. But what really burns me is the choice of games, or the lack thereof. Especially considreing this system has been around for four years.People are constantly amazed at how Nintendo still manages to sell a million copies of games, but it is really quite simple; a starving man will eat anything. And I am still hungry."
1,.............,"OK OK OK OK..... how shall i start. I don't see why i am writing this any way beause everyone will probably be owning a dreamcast(great system) X-box, Ps2(BAD system) by the time they read this. The N64 is a good system but the games are just bad. Ya, Perfect dark is OK and tony hawk is good too but THATS IT! I mean we have our share of games but we are very limited. i got this system like 2 years ago or something and ya it was ok but when ur caught playing Tony Hawk every time u just get bored. If you are a little kid and like baby games then it would be good for them becasue we have some great child games, DK64, Pokemon, i dunno stuff like that. So it all depends on your age. Hmm...... Go get yous selfs somes dreamcasts!"
4,fun but old,"It's been years since N64 came out, I feels like it's old from the design all the way to the quality of games. My son has Wii and Xbox360 as well, but for some reason he wanted this one too. I personally thought that he didn't need it, since there are so many games for the latest consoles.... Game cartridges for N64 are huge by the way.It also took a while to understand how this whole unit works along with rumble packs and other additions to it, that's being sold separately. You have to know what to buy. We learned a lot from [...], and that's where I recommend to go.Overall, my son says it's fun to play, but I will not compare it to the latest models. Just like I said, it plays, but it's old."
4,N64,Our system died and this replaced it. It works great. My family can now play the good old games again.
5,Why you should by n64,This is really good I recomend it to anyone who loves playing a verrietty of games.
2,Below Average,"I've played with the N64, and I think it's a below average game systom. It has a lot of flaws in the games. Like when I was playing Mario 64, I jumped at the top of a stair case and got sucked into a solid wall and somehow ended up at the bottem of the stairs! I think the games cost to much for what they diliver to. Every game I played compared to the Play Station (PS) was extremly short. And they have no RPG's! The sound is all blips and dongs too. They don't have a lot of good games either. Compared to the PS I think this systom is almost trash! I'm not saying I don't like Nintendo it's just that this systom has to small of a libray of games, most of the games cost to much, the sound is bad, the games are to short, lots of flaws in the games, most of the games are boring, and they have no RPG's! If you have money, save it, and either buy a PS, PS2(when it comes out in September), or the new systom that's coming out for Nintendo in a few mounths or a year. Hope this helps!"
3,Mildly satified but dissapionted,the N64 i got was in great condition for how old the system is. the only bad part is the 3 output wires were broken luckily i had a broken N64 lying around so i took the output cords from it and used them for the new one so a a disappointment that the seller didn't realize she was giving me bum cords
5,awesome system,ahhh the n64 i remember my daycare having this while everyone got in 1 huge line to just play it for ten minutes and now i actualy get to play it
5,Nintendo 64 Game System,"I love it. I get to play all my old games. I even have my granddaughter playing Donkey Kong, which she loves and she's only 4 years old. I am so glad I kept my games and got this system.The only problem I had was that the controller that came with it didn't work very well, so I brought anothher one, and we've been playing ever since."
3,Great Response Rate,The first Nintendo 64 was sent to me broken. I sent an email immediately to the seller who responded to me very quickly. He sent me another Nintendo 64 that worked well. He was very kind and gave me tips on how to use the game as well. Some of the games he sent didn't work either put the most important ones did. I would buy from this seller again because he seems very trustworthy.
2,N64 scratched up worn out controller,"When I ordered my N64 it was listed as newly refurbished in excellent condition with 1 Controller and 1 Game. When I finally got home I opened the box to find a faded scratched up N64 with the original out dated jumper pack and a dirty completely worn out Controller with the Analog Stick nearly fallen off. I also got the game without the manual in Excellent condition otherwise, but it was a title nobody has ever heard of. I installed the unit to my TV and it turned on with visable shaking screen, but I was put off by the poor condition of the product and have decided not to use it in my living room. I got what I paid for, but the item was NOT in excellent condition."
5,Nintendo 64 is AWESOME!!!!,Nintendo 64 is a truely fantastic the game Mario Kart is one of my favorite games for it. The 64 is fun video game system and the game are affordable.N64 is really the best system out there for the money.Nintendo 64 Console with Two Controllers
3,64 SYSTEM,THE 64 SYSTEM ONLY WORKED FOR ABOUT A WEEK NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHY IT STOPPD ORKING IT WS IN GOO SHAPE CAME ON TIME WAS HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT WHILE IT WORKED
4,Cool system,"this is a nice system, I like it a lot. especially when Im playing Mario Kart 64. I like to play with other 3 friends."
3,Nintendo 64,Piece o' junk is its nickname! its better than sony's playstation1 but its still a piece of junk. it has a 64 bit graphics processer and a 193.75 MHz cpu. not near as good as dreamcast or ps2. dont waste your money on this Piece o' junk! get dreamcast or ps2. i have a dreamcast and ive played many games on ps2 and I still think dreamcast is much more impressive (dreamcast's graphics are the same as ps2{128bit}and abou the the same speed{dr:200mHz-ps2:294.197mHz})
1,Faulty Equipment,I purchased this Nintendo 64 System as a Christmas gift for my son and there's nothing worse than to receive a faulty system as a gift that doesn't work. And the vendor won't replace it.Louis
1,N64,I would strongly urge everyone not to buy from Eric.joh as he does not send quality products and doesn't go out of his way to see that his customers get the refund that is due to them. I have had nothing but a bad experience from dealing with him and people like him are giving Amazon a bad reputation.
5,The BEST!,"I absolutely LOVE this baking dish! I've used it for cakes, roasted potatoes, roasts...Everything cooks evenly.A great buy."
5,Buy a Rising Star!,"I love the ballads, ""Lonely"" and ""The Beauty of Love,"" but those whose ears I trust say this lady has a great career as a strong vocal honky-tonker of country dance songs and kickers. ""Did He Mention My Name?"" and ""Get Used To It"" show an ability to belt out a strong vocal performance that is unusual at this age. ""Kinda Sorta Maybe"" could be a big hit."
5,a great purchase,"Since I was unable to buy this battery elsewhere, I thought I had to get another phone. I greatly enjoy my phone sans all the bells and whistles, so I am quite please to have gotten a replacment battery."
4,Nokia Battery,Good item! I'm not expecting a really high quality battery since I bought this battery for three dollars. But it seems a lot reliable for my backup.
5,Women Who Loved God,This book is a wonderful inspiration and great devotional. It is a great tool in working with women.
1,Not functional,"I must put this review up because I bought this album based on the existing reviews. First I will agree that the album is unique and finely crafted, it looks great. That said you must know that the only size pictures it holds are portrait (vertical) 4"" x 6"" photos, NOTHING ELSE WILL FIT. Needless to say i had to return it."
5,Very very extraordinary!,"This photoalbum turned out to be much better than I expected. All natural materials, such a wonderful design of the cover! You'll be positively suprised when you get this item. Exceeded all my expectations! Couldn't ask for more!"
5,Grand-daughter Loved It!,"Given as a Middle School grad gift along with the journal was a major hit with my 14-year old grand-daughter. These albums are stunning, practical, and made of earth friendly products. As she is a ""tree hugger"", this was especially important. I also included acid free pens, a few scrap booking items and some $$'s for her upcoming trip to Hawaii. I got 5*****'s for this gift and lots of hugs.I have purchased several of these journals and albums for various gifts, and everyone has been thrilled."
5,beautiful and inexpsensive,"Until now, I never gave much thought to how I stored my photos. Like most people, I bought imitation leather photo albums, put the photos in them and called it a day. That was the type of album I had in mind when I went on Amazon to find a photo album to use as a Christmas present. Thankfully I browsed enough to fin this line of albums. They are eye-catching, textured and very beautiful. The best part is that they are in the same price range as those cheap, forgettable ones I mentioned earlier. Buy this album if you want a better way to organize and present your photos."
5,Great Item,"I love this photo album. While on our trip to Jamaica, we purchased a smaller version, but it wouldn't hold all our photos from our trip. I was glad to find a matching album on Amazon.com."
4,Lovely Handmade Photo Album/Scrapbook,I purchased this album to make a scrap book of a recent trip around the Carribean. It worked out wonderfully. I had many horizontal images so I cut the strings that were for vertical pictures and glued the images strait onto the pages. This book looks amazing and is a very high quality. Definite good buy.
5,A golden-age master of Science Fiction returns,"Murray Leinster was very hot in the world of science fiction -- several decades ago. As the years wore on, he was largely forgotten, except for one story of his, ""First Contact."" ""First Contact"" has appeared in numerous ""Best of"" collections and won a ""Retro-Hugo"" (a Hugo handed out for work in a year when there were no Hugos, 1946). Now you can have ""First Contact"" (I'm not the only one who thinks it's the best first contact story ever.) along with 23 other great (some are classic) tales from S.F.'s golden age. You'll be suprised at how well these hold up. Plus this book is a real treat. It's on acid-free paper, and it's a well-bound, solid hardcover."
5,This product is awesome!,"I use this unit for just about any mixing job. I mix homemade ranch dressing, whip egg whites, make whipped cream, and cream butter and sugar with ease. I also use it to mix thick batters and the motor does not have trouble handing this. I find that the unit is solid and doesn't vibrate and move, even though I supervise it while it's on. I have used the dough hooks to mix thick bread batter (not dough which needs kneading). I have had absolutely no trouble with this unit and I think it's an excellent value for the price. I like the handy booklet that tells me which speed is recommended for each type of mixing job. The stainless steel bowls are wonderful and I use them for jobs that aren't even mixer-related. The large bowl is quite large and excellent for me to mix muffin batter by hand.I highly recommend this mixer!"
2,Poor Hooper Humperdink,"It was alright of a book. I thought it was kind of sad how the narrator did now want to invite Hooper but invited everyone else from A to Z. It was pretty cute how they went through the alphabet when naming the kids who were invited. In the end he ends up having a change in heart and invites Hooper Humperdink. I liked the illistrations, they were very colorful and detailed. If your younger sibling or child is learning the alphabet, then this is the book to read to them."
5,Excellent read-aloud book for birth to 100.,"I rate this book a definite ""10"" because, out of 800 books of my daughter's, this is her absolute favorite. She is now 8 years old, but she has enjoyed this book being read to her since she was approximately six months of age. Now she enjoys reading this book aloud to others, as she did during her ""show and tell"" time in her second grade classroom. This 25 cent garage sale find (with Theo LeSieg being the pseudonym used for the author, which is ""Giesel"" spelled backwards) is my very favorite--the rhyming text is unbelievably appealing and a pleasure to anyone's ears."
4,Great book!,My 3 year old son found this book in the library when we were on vacation. He loves reading books and remembers them so well. We read this book only 2 times and then he was saying lines from it. It is very catchy! I never knew saying Hooper Humperdink could be so much fun! Plus some of the names used in the book are names of his friends and he thinks that is funny!! As soon as we returned from vacation I came on here and ordered this book! I knew it was a must have. He pretty much has the entire book memorized!
4,Hooper Humperdink - Not Him?,Kids love this book. Get with it and put it back in print. It is a favorite for circle-time reading and evening oral reading time. Please reconsider its availability and print it again!
1,Hooper Humperdink...Not him!,"What a shame they've changed the author's name (Dr. Suess did write it, but did so under his pen name Theo. LeSieg, which was his practice when he didn't illustrate the book.) An even bigger pity: that they should have a different illustrator. Charles Martin illustrated the original and did a fine job at that."
5,Great book for a new reader,Again Christmas book for 6 year old granddaughter who is just learning to read and her 4 year old brother. They both love Dr. Seuss and this book!
3,"ok, but be careful with the nonstick surface!",This is perfect for making hamburger buns and muffin tops but watch out for the nonstick surface- it scratches off very easily.
2,Muffin pan,Not the pan that I expected. I take too much dough to fill the cup and it doesn't run over the top to make a top like a muffin has. This is called a puffy muffin crown pan not a muffin top pan. Will probally have to purchase a muffin top pan.
4,Pan,"We got this item in the mail really fast,have to say I have not got to use it yet though,hopefully soon."
5,Warning: Most 2012 Editions Of This Are Currently BURNED DVD-R's,"While there is some question of where they're being sourced from (they MAY be official) just as an fyi, most of the copies of this superb set currently running around are burned discs.Ask your vendor BEFORE ordering! Most of the burned sets have a small sticker that says ""DVDR"" in the bottom front left corner.Other Roans are starting to turn up this way also; the problem I have is that this is not being disclosed; in some cases the retailer doesn't even know they're selling burned discs.Content wise, if you're a fan of pre-codes these are the best prints I'm aware of, which is why I gave it 5 stars."
5,Millie,"Loved this movie. This is definitely a movie of ""forbidden Holywood"". This movie touches on lesbianism, attempted rape and how life in the fast lane affects one woman."
4,"package states "" color film""","Fine performance by Helen , however disappointed as it states it was in color. I was expecting 2-strip technicolor."
2,An alright video,"This video is an ""alright"" compilation of three pre code films, the video quality is nothing to brag about, though understandable due to the age of the films and the wear on the source material. The sound is acceptable once again with relation to the age of the film. If you are a fan of these films this will probably be the best presentation of them available. If your not a particular fan and just looking for good movies to watch from the thirties I would probably recomend against this one."
4,Nice Camera,"Received two webcams as gifts. They were easy to install. I have Windows Vista and they worked just fine. My husband tried to connect it with Skype, and ran into some issues with his XP, I didn't try it with Vista yet because I have Windows Live on my computer."
1,Hercules Blog Webcam,"The Webcam did not work correctly in Windows Vista. I didn't try it in Windows XP.Look for warnings popups: ""Continous use will distroy your computer!"""
4,revise previous review/be careful how you open it,"I previously reviewed this product and gave it a bad review, but upon reflection, it was probably my own fault. You have to be very careful about how you pull these out and put them back. If you are not used to this type of headphone, you need to make sure you pull both sides out equally and evenly at the same time. I tried to just pull out one side, not both at the same time, and that just totally screwed the thing up from the beginning. They need to have on the box/package: WARNING: YOU MUST PULL BOTH CORDS OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND SAME SPEED, AND REPLACE THEM THE SAME WAY. Had they done this, I would probably still be using them as opposed to being tossed."
1,Still haven't received.,"They sent the wrong parfum. Got in touch with them to get information on where to return it. They said they would send me the right Parfum when they receive the return.I sent the return priority mail, insured with SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION. Post Office confirms that they signed for and received the return from me on August 3, 2009. I waited and waited and waited for the Parfum. I then EMailed them asking for the status of this order.I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING AS FAR AS PRODUCT AND NOTHING AS FAR AS COMMUNICATION OR EXPLAINATION ABOUT MY $83.00 ORDER. This has gone on way to long. How can you help me? I have tied being patient and it is not working. This company does not care. HELP.PS: I wouldn't have given 1 STAR, but you have to put at least a star or your review won't be registered."
1,BAD SELLER,The seller would NOT communicate. The item sent was the spray and not the splash. Amazon finally refunded the product. I would not recommend this seller to anyone.
2,He Must Be Rolling in His Grave!,"This work was painfully de-gayed. This film made it look like Keith Haring cared about causes for communities in which he was not a member. He was valiant on those issues too. However, he was a proud gay man. He made art that had homoerotic themes. Andy Warhol was a mentor to him, but not just as an artist, both were openly gay men in the heavily homophobic 1980s. This disc showed some of Haring's safer sex messages, but they just breeze past the art he produced on a large pink triangle. At the end, they say he died in 1990. However, they should have said, ""He died in 1990 due to complications from AIDS."" If Madonna could do AIDS activism in Keith's name during the time this documentary was made, then this documentary could have been bolder. Keith worked hard to liberate gay men. This disc is not a respectful tribute to him. It's offensive in its erasure."
4,Nice Series.,"Once again a series I liked but for some reason I just didn't see it as five stars, I can suggest it as a purchase and really think you will like it."
3,Its okay,"This series doesn't keep things as action packed as I would have hoped, but the animation is top notch. I'm glad I was able to buy in a complete edition because part one is boring literally, there's alot of standard emotion blah blah and I think there is only three fights with the final fight being a sleeper. The second part picks up however, it's more intriguing because it explores Birdy's past and there's is way more action. Birdy the mighty the complete series is a decent buy, I could not imagine buying in parts because I would have shot myself after part 1."
4,A glimpse inside Miss Posh,"I read this book over the summer & I must say, it was quite an entertaining read. Victoria is blatantly honest, she tells you up from the get go that she's never been a big fan of school and how she was isolated as a youth but how she came alive through dance. I think she has a very supporitve family. She gives us glimpses of her so called ""Posh Life"". I love the fact that this book came with pictures. It's really entertaining but at times it's honesty kinda hurts. I really didn't fancy her golddigger boyfriend but was happy when she met her true love, David Beckham, also a tragic time in her life was when her security guard faked the whole paranoia plot to keep work. Though many ups and downs Victoria has had a fairy tale life, not only was she a part of the biggest selling girl group of all times but she's constantly about buisness and maintaining a healthy family life.Kudos to Mrs. Beckham for a job well done.Best,[...]"
2,TMI,"Too much information. I have to skip over many parts because of the extensive boring background information. I really hate to skip over anything in a book but it gets bogged down. On the other hand, Victoria's book "" that extra half inch"" is really really good. Lots of helpful, directional information and short and sweet with good pics, and drawings. I think every woman can pull a few things out of this book."
1,Victoria Beckham is DELUDED!!!,"This book on the surface seems to be just another quickly rushed, put together autobiography for monetary reasons alone...which is Victoria Beckham all over. This book is now a few years old and you'd be surprised that since it's publication the amount of contraditions that have been exposed about this talentless, insecure, attention hungry, mean to the bone so called ""entertainer"" is hilarious. If you want to be sucked into this con game then go ahead but lies, lies, lies will be all you'll be reading. A big fat 0/10 for this one."
3,Sparks Fly,"I recently purchased my grill. each time I use it when plugging in or unplugging I get sparks in my Electrical Outlet..For the price you would think they could have installed an off/on switch and a timer. I was very disappointed. By the way this was all the outlets in my kitchen due to the fact that you have current running as soon as contact is made. I called the manufactuer, the reply was..if uncomfortable return to store. Which I am going to do."
2,Just Average Among the Many Grills Available on the Market,(1)Fails to grill both sides of meat easily; tendancy to burn underside despite frequent turning. I recommend thinning out all your meats by cutting laterally. (2)Cleanup is definitely not as easy as advertised. (3)Biggest Complaint- this grill does not have a moat to keep juices and flavor from seasoning locked in during closed cooking. Requires users to use brush to marinate often.
4,a few problems,"I love the ""George"", but have started to encounter a few problems. I have owned the ""George"" for several months and have had wonderful meals from it. Recently, I have noticed that the surface of the grill is starting to peel in a couple of places. Close to the edge and right in the middle of the grill on the raised bumps. Not sure how this could happen, since I clean it with papertowels or soft sponges. Would love to hear if there is anything we could do about this. And one more thing, I think it would be a great idea for the drip pans to be stainless steel. The plastic is hard to clean because grease and plastic are not a good match. Thank you"
4,want more,have a xxlarge grill I love use every day some time two and three a day except nonstick surface on mine has gone bad but it could have been something I've done.
3,A quick way to cook healty food...with a few problems,"This is a wonderful cooking piece for any kitchen. It cooks food fast! I mean really fast. The food also comes out with very little grease. I have found a few problems though. The non stick coating does wear off after awhile. Also, the grill is can be very difficult to clean after you have cooked on it. Please note that while the fat is dripping away so are those tasty juices--so sometimes the food can be a little dried out.I do recommend this product though for people who don't have a lot of time. You can cook a meal in a matter of only minutes. This is nice because it allows you to avoid the alternative of fast cooking--normally a microwave dinner or something else that isn't to healthy. Great product for people on the go!"
3,Some insights,"The George Foreman grill does a good job at cooking almost anything, however is you are after the ""grilled"" taste don't be fooled by this appliance. With thick cuts of beef or lamb, it is also difficult to uniformly cook them on the inside and outside. If you are after well-done meats, than you have to watch that they don't become dried out and overdone on the outside.Clean up can be messy. However, I have found that by reheating the grill and using wet paper towels, the clean up is much simpler. This method also might solve the problem that some of the other reviewers mentioned about their surface coating coming off. Using this method may be less abrasive.The grill is certainly easier than turning on the oven and I have found that the cooking time is also greatly reduced. None of the reviews mentioned grilled vegetables and I think they also come out very well on the Foreman grill.Overall, not a bad purchase."
3,Great grill - but short useable life.,"The grill does everything it is advertised to do. I think it is a real asset in the kitchen for the family. We use ours often. It also cooks VERY clean. The only problem we experienced is that the non-stick coating on the grill surfaces is not very durable. The coating in fact is rather poor and comes off easily after only two months moderate use. Once the coating is gone, foods will stick and burn. I have used only wet towels and soft sponges on the grill surfaces. I think these contact grills are outstanding and hope this manuf will take another look at the durability of their non-stick coating."
5,Finally got one and it is everything I heard it would be,"Finally got one and it is everything I heard it would be from Tv commercials to friends. This is a great tool in the kitchen and so easy to clean. We have a family of four and this is the perfect size.I had heard so many wonderful things from friends, a retired couple had loved it and other friends were sending their kids off to college with one. I can see now why everyone was loving it. The clean up is SO EASY and this IS a healthier way to eat. The food cooks evenly and easily. Love making hamburgers and chicken in it and seeing all that fat drip away from the food.My husband can cook on it and you add a light healthy salad and you have made a great meal without making a mess.This machine is everything you have heard and well worth the purchase!"
1,Please enter a title for your review,"End Of Fashion is the worst local alt-rock i've heard in a long time. They can't match Jet for rudimentaryness, of The Vines for sheer musical ineptitude, but their riffs, chord progressions, and melodies seem expertly crafted to utterly reject harmonic flow without replacing it with dissonance, creating the kind of musical black hole that only the worst britpop can achieve."
5,Love it!! Great music from a guitar Master!,How delightful to be able to have wonderful going-to-bed music for my little ones that are fantastic pieces of music played by a guitar Master. Ricardo's technique is perfect (!) and so expressive and fun. This is isn't just for the kids!
3,Once the smell goes away...,"I recently purchased this crock pot and the first thing that hit me when I plugged it in was a strong smell, hard to describe, an electrical smell but not a burning, like faulty wiring. I thought maybe it was because it is new. I cooked my meal in it and the smell of the crock pot overshadowed the smell of the food. Everyone asked what the smell was when they got home. Now I am using the crock pot for the 5th time tonight and it seems that the new smell has dissipated. There may still be a trace of this but it could be that I am sensitive to it and am smelling for it. I emailed Farberware and asked them if this was common, as no one else mentioned it in their reviews, and they never responded. Something to consider if buying any more Farberware products. However, I love having a big crock pot. Great for big batches of spaghetti sauce, pot roasts and so on. A great companion to your crock pot is America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes by Donna-Marie Pye."
3,Pleased with this item......except,"Overall I am very pleased with my slow cooker. The one downfall, and the reason I rated it 3 stars is because the outside of the cooker becomes very hot. Especially when on high cooking temperature.I do like the ease of the lift out crock, the glass lid, and the large oval shape.When the time comes to buy another slow cooker, I will defiantely look for a cool touch model."
2,Farberware Slow Cooker FSC600,"I was disappointed in the performance of this cooker. It is too hot and too fast. With my old cooker a four-pound roast, set on low, would take 10-12 hours and it would be very tender. With this cooker, the roast was well-done and tough in the same amount of time at the same low setting. I tried another at 8 hours and it was still well-done. The next time I tried it at six hours. It was a little better, but still not what I wanted. It it just too hot!"
4,New crockpot owner,"We wanted to get a another crockpot but it was sold out and we ended up with this faberware 6qt. We love it. There's plenty of room for a big roast beef, but someone else said the sides get hot and it's true. Even on low heat,it's chrome so it gets hot. But overall a great purchse. Easy to clean too."
1,where is my review?,I wrote a second review entitled do not buy this product regarding the farberware crockpot. It was faulty and quit after I wrote the previous review it shorted out and burnt up. Are you not going to publish my comments about it? You won't publish my comments if I say that I did not like that you made me pay the shipping? If you have reviews people should be permitted to say the good and the bad! I would like a response if that review is going to be rejected.
1,Fire Hazard,"We have owned a Farberware FSC600 6-Quart Oval Slow Cooker for about three years. We have always noted a strange odor like hot wiring when we have used the cooker. Today we used the cooker and noted that it would not get warm. The light was on. I took the bottom off. The wiring was found to be floating between the heating element and the bottom of the cooker. A twist splice had touched the metal bottom and melted the wiring. I was shocked to see that the cooker is UL approved with such sloppy and unprofessional wiring. I am lucky that it did not kill us. BEWARE of this cooker. Of course, made in China!"
3,Adequate Cooking Ability,"I bought this slow cooker about two years ago. After reading the reviews, I'm glad that I'm not the only one that thinks this machine gets too hot! I guess other slow cooker don't get that hot? I'm not sure since this is the only one I've owned.Also, I found that even though I follow the recommended cooking time with all the recipes I've tried, most of the meats finish quick. I've talked to my mom about it, and I honestly think that the low 200-degree setting is higher than 200 degrees. I've never cooked anything on high, but I really think the low setting is messed up.Over all, I've never had disastrous results with this machine. However, since there are other cookers on the market, I won't buy this Farberware one again."
2,Great looking but too hot,This is a great looking crock pot with a very nice lid (stainless steel edge). Unfortunately this crock pot gets extremely hot outside and any touch of the outside will burn you.
1,Disappointing experience with this brand,"When it cooks properly, it's fine. However, the crock cracked after about 5-6 uses. They sent a free replacement crock (after a 4-6 wk wait), but the lid didn't fit the replacement. They sent a new lid (another 4-6 wk wait), but that didn't fit either, now it loses so much steam it doesn't cook well. And, as others have experienced, the metal exterior gets hot enough to actually burn you. Very disappointing. I will not buy another one of these."
1,Exploding lid,"The first time I used this crockpot and four hours after turning it on, (Contents beef roast, carrots, and onions) with me standing approx. four feet from it, I heard a big bang, and glass flew all over the kitchen. The lid had exploded ruining our dinner."
5,Love this SlowCooker,"This slow cooker does everything a slow cooker should do AND it looks great! I have no complaints. I highly recommend it. I've made chili, pork tenderloin, teriyaki steak. I love the size as well. I've entertained with it and it makes entertaining so much easier because I don't have to keep checking on the meat in the oven!"
5,Insightful and timely,"Wow, this book really puts things in perspective. As a landlord, I read this book to provide me with accurate information regarding the safety (or danger) of allowing dogs to live in my properties. I am so very glad I did. The book points the infrequency and lack of severity of most dog bites and offers solutions to help prevent future dog attacks from occurring. I now feel armed and educated to set realistic, responsible dog policy. The statistics are mind blowing and the information is invaluable. Dogs Bite is great resource for landlords, policy makers, schools, media outlets, etc."
4,Good Overview of the Industry,"This short book is a good overview of the cigarette manufacturing industry. While it is not a history of tobacco, (and doesn't pretend to be) it does offer a brief look at how tobacco use came about and how it grew into the massive industry of today.The focus of the book is on cigarettes, which are a large, but not the total component of tobacco companies. With a slant toward the financial aspects of the industry, the author covers most of the big events in cigarette history, including pricing, advertising, lawsuits and much more.While a good book, it is getting dated and that can be seen by many of the numbers used. It may be time for a new edition or to drop the book from the catalog."
4,Turns any lawn Beautiful...!!,I have used this for years it turned my lawn from dust and weeds to a beautiful green grass. Although once put down it does need watering about 2 times a week. Or it will just burn your lawn in the hot sun.. Found out the hard way last year:(Note: there is smaller bags are available.
1,It Burned My Lawn,"Like others have mentioned, this product burned my lawn. I applied this product about ten days ago and started seeing the yellow discoloration about two days after the application. I live in Southern California and applied this in late March, just before the summer heat. I followed the direction to the tee, watered my lawn just before application, but now am experiencing discouragement from the huge yellow spots on my previous green healthy lawn. I just spent half a day thatching and aerating the lawn in hopes this will help my lawn come back to its health green state. I'll follow up in a few weeks but so far, am very discouraged by this products effects."
1,burned more than once,"unfortunately Scotts took my money and burned my lawn. I mean completely burned it.. I followed the directions, watered first, selected no. 3.5 on the drop spreader. I didn't overlap as a matter of fact i separated further than needed. Two days after the lawn was a disaster. Stay away from this product, especially where it says guarantees it won't burn!?!"
1,Kills grass!,"Last summer we had a reasonable amount of grass in our yard--enough to need to mow once a week. We also had dandelions.We spread this stuff around the yard--not difficult--and watered or whatever like we were supposed to. We followed all instructions and our type of grass should've been fine with this weed killer.A week or two later we spread grass seed TWICE. Watered the rest of the season.This season our yard is officially comprised of DIRT. No grass. There isn't anything growing there. While it's nice that Scotts was kind enough to save us the need to mow our lawn, it's not what we signed up for. We were hoping for thick grass with minimal dandelions to have to deal with. We didn't expect to end up with 'less' grass than we started with, and certainly not left with ZERO grass! What the hell Scott's?"
1,Buyer Beware!,"My husband applied this product to our lawn using a Scotts Spreader and exactly per the directions. There's brown spots all over the lawn! Complete waste of money not to mention the extra water I'm using now to salvage the lawn! Lesson learned, never using chemical fertilizers or weed control products again!"
1,Lawn went from bad to worse with this product...BEWARE!,"I purchased this product because I noticed several empty spots on my lawn and wanted more grass. Unfortunately, after applying this grass seed with a spreader, my lawn went from empty spots to empty spots with burned spots where the good grass was. You would think an official product of Major League Baseball (which prides itself on its green grassy fields) would work well, but BEWARE...THIS PRODUCT WILL BURN GRASS...NOT GROW IT!I'm going to try Pennington or Viagara or any other company than Scott's! Thanks for burning up an already precarious lawn!"
4,Very nice shoes,"I haven't worn a pair of boat shoes in years, but I'm glad I got these. Very comfortable. My only complaint is that the support isn't great, but most of that is due to the nature of the style of shoe itself. Other than that, great casual shoe."
5,Great shoes,"Bought these for my husband for xmas, which he already had a pair but needed new ones. He loves them, wears them everywhere, and says they are super comfy!"
4,excellent shoe,"I couldn't believe that the shoe would be a full size too large so I went with a half size smaller, and was wrong. A full size smaller than normal is, if anything, still slightly large. But a fine shoe!"
5,Wonderful shoes,I've had a pair of these for years. I was wearing them occasionally but have been using them as my full time work shoes for the last 18 months. I was just giving them a leather treatment this evening and was examining them closely. They are still is good condition with just a little wear on the soles. I do use a pair of superfeet shoe liners with them because of a back problem.When they do wear out I'll be replacing them with another pair. I am very happy with them.
2,Quality seems to slip with each pair I buy,"This is the third pair I have bought over the course of 5+ years. I order the brown/brown color.First pair was 5 stars, the next 4 stars. This one three stars: The dye color of the leather in the shoe is poorly matched. Also, the foot insert is problematic. It is removable (good), but the end covering the ball of the foot is not stiff and tends to fold up with use. Also, I swear the number of stitches per inch used to make the shoe has gone down with this last attempt, making the shoe look cheaper than earlier versions.The sole remains well crafted and should withstand long hard use. The shoe remains well priced.Oct 6, 2011 update: this pair lasted only 4 months before the stiching along the side gave way (on both shoes). On prior pairs, this took more than 2 years to occur. I must conclude that the shoe maker is substituting lower quality stitching on newer shoes. I would now give 2 stars to these shoes."
5,Excellent Shoes,"This is the fifth pair of Timberland Kia Way shoes that I have owned. Each has been very comfortable and has had a very long life span, particularly given the amount that I wear these shoes. I plan to continue buying and wearing these as long as Timberland keeps making them."
2,Disappointed,"Fit is loose. Outer soul is very thin and flimsy. Looks cheap for this brand. I ended up buying a ""comparable"" shoe from Docker, that was much more comfortable, with far better looks and durability."
2,Quality is garbage,"The video-quality of my copy was absolute garbage, blurry to the point of giving me a headache and incredibly distracting. Buy a book, I suggest ""Speed Secrets"", ultimately it's much more informative than this video."
3,Good for beginer,"Video is well made although old. Concepts are solid, but not much more than basic racing technique. Go take the class."
4,Fast Response,Skip Barber - Going Fasterwas an immediate success demonstrated by it's immediate review by the recipient - in isolation!
4,"Not the Greastest, but mad smooth nonetheless.","This album is tight, but in a subtle way. This album won't knock you off your feet at a first listen, like ""Midnight Marauders"" or ""Liquids Swords."" It's an album that slowly grows on you with every listen. This an album more geared for chilling. Give the Peas a few years and they could easily join the royal family of innovative hip-hop comprised of the Roots, ATCQ, De La, and the Beastie Boys."
5,This IS what Hip Hop really is!,"This IS what Hip Hop really is! Many people confuse Hip Hop with RAP and this is Hip Hop! I was really getting worried for the future of Hip Hop. Back in the day the leaders of Hip Hop where pretty much De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest and others... BEP falls into this category. I have no problem putting these guys on the same level of excellence. Great linguistics and a good sense of humor. Hip Hop has a future and these guys are keeping that alive!"
2,Boring,"This cd is very tiring. I am a generall B.E.P. fan and I know that they have potential and can do much better. The beats on this cd, Behind the Front, are weak and repetitive. Spend your money on Skankonia by Outkast, or Elephunk, the later cd by this group."
3,originality? no. But still a decent CD.,"This Cd is pretty good the first month you listen to it, and I still don't mind it much, but these guys gotta (a) start rapping (really rapping) (b) stop using other people's songs as the base for each of their own songs. They need to come up with their own beats damnit! But, they do sound pretty good sometimes, and some tracks are actually real good. I do recommend you buy it, because it is by no means a bad CD, its just not great."
5,Fabulous,Lyrics are great. Music is bumpin. I love this CD and play it all the time. Buy it. Buy it now.
2,Black Eyed Peas tasting bland,"The Black Eyed Peas fall flat musically on this album. I admire their effort to write their own music and use live instruments, but the music lacks real power. I've seen them live and they have a great stage presence, but that presence doesn't translate to disc. If they work on their compositional chops, then they'll be a serious force in music."
2,Very Average,Black Eyed Peas are Kinda catchy in a 2nd tier Aressted Development Mode.but they just don't have the right material on this Set.I can see them coming back but another Disc Like this will make them a What Happened to them Real fast.cuz so many folks have flowed on and used these beats before.
3,the sent him broke,"i love the black eyed peas but the ship is bad, the corner came broken and the lid too"
4,First and Good Album B.E.P.,1. Fallin' Up - 52. Clap Your Hands - 4.53. Joints & Jam - 54. Way U Make Me Feel - 45. Movement - 56. Karma - 47. Be Free - 2(SAY WHAT?????)8. Say Goodbye - 49. Duet - 4.510. Communication - 411. What It Is - 3.512. Que Dices? - 4.513. A8 - 414. Love Won't Wait - 3.515. Head Bobs - 4.516. Positivity - 4Lyrics - 3.5/5Production - 4/5
4,"Amazing, But Not as Good as Elephunk","Boring? What are you thinking? Right now I'm listening to my album and I can definitely say it is one of the greatest albums I've heard in a long time. It's not like other albums, Just the same songs. Behind The Front has it's own unique style and flow in all the songs. There are only a few I can say are not good, Duet and Love Won't Wait. I love the Gameshow bit at the end of Movement and Fallin' Up, and I love El Neenio :D Rock On BEP! I can't understand while this album never kicked off into sucess. (...)Anyway, Buy this Album, It ROCKS"
4,4 outta 5 aint bad!,"Solid 4 outta 5, If you like Digable Planets, and Souls of Mischief, you gonna be diggin this! But they are no ATCQ or ROOTS! The first 4 or 5 songs come out slammin and your puttin these guys up their with DeLa and GANGSTARR but the rest of the album brings you back down to reality. Still those first couple tracks are well worth the duckets! I'm out."
5,The Perfect Partner for your Low-Carb Diet,"My doctor sais I needed to be healthier while on the Atkins Diet because I was eating too many fatty foods like bacon and eggs. A friend suggested this book to me, and it has opened up a new world of healthy, low-carb possibilities. And the best thing is that they all taste great too -- especially the desserts! I also bought one of the author's other cookbooks called The Lowfat Grill. It's also great for low-carb dieters who want to watch fat intake too."
1,unrealistic,"I ordered this cookbook based on the reviews, and ordered another called ""Fabulous Lo-Carb Cuisine"". I paged through both and immediately put Ultimate Low-Carb Diet Cookbook back in the box to ship back for a refund. There were WAY too many recipes that I wouldn't even consider preparing...not because they didn't sound good...but that they weren't quick and easy. Anything that involves trips to the ""speciality"" grocery store and a ton of ingredients and prep work is a turn off for me.I instead kept the tiny book of awesome recipes that were quick, easy and realistic for my lifestyle. (Not to mention yummy)This one was way too ""out there"" for me and unrealistic for daily use."
3,Great book,"I just made the Pumpkin and Walnut Bread (used pecans though) and it is great. I felt like I was cheating on my diet. I recommend this book highly, especially if you are tired of just sugar-free jello desserts."
4,Low-Carb,"If you're on the path of eating the low-carb way, this cookbook offers endless possibilities of preparing simple, new, healthy and tasty foods that trick you into thinking you're eating all the things you shouldn't!"
2,Incompatible with Bettina Newman's book,"I bought this book when I bought Smart Low-Carb Eating (Bettina Newman's book). I read the Newman book and tried a couple of recipes (which were very good), then re-read it. I then took a look at the Rodnitzky book and almost fell over when I saw the number of calories in some of her recipes. Let's not kid ourselves with this low-carb diet business: calories and portions do count. 700 calories in a serving? Are you kidding? There's no way these two books are going to jibe. If you agree with Bettina Newman that there's a smart way to do the low-carb thing (minding portions, for one thing), you needn't bother buying the Rodnitzky book because you'll do what I'm going to do: send it back."
5,Applying the Wisdom,"I have waited for this book, and I am not disappointed. As we all naturally gravitate toward that which is right...in our soul, body and mind...this book plugs in to that process for each one of us. Mr. Gelb's style is immensely gracious and clear; it is easy to imagine using this book with teenagers, young parents and senior citizens.The orgnization of the book is such that my reading group will take each of the seven principles and go through the self-assessments and practical suggestions. There seems to be just the right amount of information presented to enable new connections and enhance development of compassion, creativity and consciousness. As a professor, I also plan to use Mr. Gelb's work with my students in college--future special educators. We all stand to benefit from the wisdom of exploring the dimensions of developing potential."
5,Spirituality Artistically and Creatively Shared,"I enjoyed this book and have shared it with several friends. Bravo to Michael Gelb and many authors like him who are writing with insight, clarity and depth of spirit that I believe is unparalleled in prior works.We are living in a time of expansion of human spirit and thought that gives great hope in the future of our world. My favorite part of this book was the chapter on the Mona Lisa and its story about the gifted children who immediately understood and described the secret of the balance of life so effortlessly.Thank you Mr. Gelb for your work. I enjoyed your previous book but believe you've outdone yourself. Encore!"
5,DaVinci Decoded- Wisdom to be shared,"Michael Gelb's latest book DaVinci Decoded is this year's Holiday Gift to my family and friends. I find guidance, comfort and inspiration in this book and I want to share my discoveries with everyone. Michael has condensed the wisdom of Leonardo DaVinci (the ultimate Renaissance Man) into seven principles.This format makes a Renaissance frame of mind accessible, easy to grasp and simple enough to put into practice. Mr. Gelb's work makes me believe that with a little effort on our part,a dream of a 21st Century Renaissance is attainable."
2,False Advertisement,"The memory card show in this add is not the one you will recieve. It is not a memory card made by Sony or by Performance. Its made by ""Hip Gear"" with the following label on the back ""PSX 1Mb Memory Card"". The first card I recieved failded after a few weeks and then the seller sent another one to make up for it so I will see how this one works out, but is still made by ""Hip Gear""."
2,Gray was Pink,"I ordered a Gray PSOne memory card to only receive an off brand ""PINK"" one to my surprise. It works, just not what was displayed when ordering online, so beware!"
1,Corrupted Data; also it's not a gray memory card.,"Two problems:1. I did not receive the same color memory card as what was advertised, but I figured that wasn't a big deal, so I disregarded it and started to use it.2. After playing video games for like 3 hours, I save, and the next time I come back to load the game, the data is corrupted! So I figure that might have just been a fluke, and I start over from the beginning of the game (an RPG, so you can imagine how obnoxious that is). I save, come back later that day to play, and when I load, it's CORRUPTED again. It can't be a coincidence.In conclusion, DON'T BUY THIS MEMORY CARD."
2,false advertising,"the product if thus far working just fine. however, the picture is clearly of a GRAY memory card, and mine was not. this does not really bother me but makes me wonder about the reliability of the seller. if this might be a problem for you, perhaps think it over again."
1,It doesn't save,I was sent a PS One Memory Card that won't hold on to memory. It'll instantly forget it the next time you try to play the game you attempted to save. Be aware.
3,Why?,"I'm wondering why my memory card hasn'tgotten here yet?I put it on express delivery, I paid theextra amount and it's been almost two weeks...Why?"
4,the memory card works and is very good.,it got to me in the time they said it would and it works which is why they are getting four stars from me.
1,PS-1 Memory Card,"It's unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand now.Sony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their PS-3.that have had constant complaints from customers.There are a lot of Very Good PS 1 GAMES OUT THERE,AND YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM WITHOUT THE MEMORY CARD.wEITE TO sony AND COMPLAIN."
4,works good,"I agree with Pat, it's a memory card and it works. I didn't recieve the exact memory card that they show, but it was still a sony made ps1 card. I have had experiences with other non-sony made memory cards and it would format but then was not recognized by the playstation. It kept saying to insert the card but it was already there... my advice, buy only sony made ps1 memory cards."
1,HORRIBLE!,My best advise is to never buy a memory card online! I couldn't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time. I suggest not to buy memory cards online.
5,"An interesting, informative autobiography of the war years","I enjoyed this book, centered in the years of World War II, about one woman's contribution and about the Waves, an auxiliary of the U.S. Navy that was formed at that time. Over 100,000 American women served in the Waves. It is a book similar in tone to Jackie Cochran's biography which told about the creation of the Wasps. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about the Waves, or wishing to read a charming story about a young girl growing up during the depression, coming of age during the war and going on to raise a family in the suburbs."
2,Lacks Personality,The music is low scale. Elevator music with bossa nova beat. The songs just don't stick.
3,For the Star Trek Fan,"This shirt was fine for a Halloween costume. It is all synthetic, and feels a bit skimpy, but the wearer was pleased with it. The size ran a bit small, and the price was a bit much for a nylon/poly shirt. It was rather clingy. All in all, it does look 'authentic' and it was fine for a costume.Delivery and service from the vendor was great."
1,No Noe,"The sole reason why I bought this book in the first place is because I am a huge fan of Ignacio Noe, who is credited in the by-line of the book's listing here on Amazon (as of the writing of this review). Imagine my surprise and massive disappointment to see not the slightest trace of Noe in the book when it arrived. Not one pencil mark, not one word of editing, not even a endorsing forward in the front. The man didn't even so much as proof read the thing! Needless to say, I am not happy on those grounds alone.As to how the book stands on its own merits, again, I am more than a wee bit disappointed. The art is only so-so, the action is sparse and kind of choppy, and the overall feel is less than satisfactory on multiple levels. If you're looking for a good book of this kind, I recommend Ship of Fools. If you're looking to blow a few bucks just because you can, go ahead and try this one."
5,Reading for younger children,Love the Usborne science/social studies series! This is targeted for beginner readers up to 3rd grade I would say. Here are books that have some substance to them and not babbied down. My son is so interested in space and this was the perfect book that he could read all by himself.
2,Would not stick even to itself,Rip off. Very expensive. Especially when the stickum on the tape does not stick well at all. Bought to tape end of christmas light extention cords together. H ad great trouble getting it to stick to its self. Took multiple tries and still would come loose. Extremely strange characteristic for all weather tape. Don't waste your money.
5,Salerno,"I ordered this book for my father who is currently 92 and soon to turn 93 and a WWII veteran of the N. African, Sicilian and Italian campaigns. He is so busy and active, driving hither and thither, to and fro. No grass grows under his feet. This book is special to him since by his participation in those campaigns, he is essence, ""wrote"" part of the information in this book. It's unfortunate that on this feedback page there is no format to upload an image of my father who served with the 5th Army."
4,"Very well made, just a little loud","I decided to purchase this fan since I have grown tired of those plastic things that seem to last about a couple of years and then break. This one is extremely well-made. I love the deco look. I'm not sure how easy it is going to be to clean. Guess I'll figure that out when it gets dirty. The only surprise was how loud it is. I remember my grandmother had an oscillating fan like this that also was loud. If you run it on low speed it is fine. On high speed it is louder than I expected. However, if you're looking for something to drown out street noise this is the fan for you. I live on a busy street and when it is set on high, it even drowns out the fire trucks!"
4,paperback book,I was completely satisfied with my order. It came quickly and was in perfect condition. Thanks for suggesting the entire set. I would order again.
2,Decent yarn ruined by obtuse detectives!,"I wanted to like this book. Sonora is a true original, and the other characters seemed well-drawn, with realistic dialog and many humorous touches. However -- and this is a big reservation -- I was flabbergasted that she & her sidekicks couldn't figure out why Joelle was killed until the very end! For Pete's sake, I had it nailed on page 39 as soon as Sonora found the girl's secret stash of kidnapped children materials. Even Joelle's journal entries all but shouted the truth -- how more obvious a clue do you need?! I read a ton of mysteries and, to me, one of the hallmarks of greatness is when I am left guessing 'til the last page. On that count, this book failed miserably, because the only ones left guessing were the detectives."
3,hood?,I might actually buy this WATERPROOF coat IF it had a hood? So many of them don't and I didn't see it in the description...how odd and impractical!
2,GEORGE FORMAN GRILL,"I have used my grill about five times. It makes excellent hamburgers - draining away most of the fat. The negative thing is as I was cleaning it, the ""non-stick"" surface wiped off - I was using a Handi-wipe which should not have caused this."
2,Good grill but....,"My brother bought me this grill as a wedding gift last year, and it was amazing for about half a year. Slowly the non-stick coating began coming off, and now it's completely gone on the bottom rack and I can't cook hamburgers on it anymore because half of my burger sticks to the pan. I've tried non-stick spays and they don't help any. Very sad. It still cooks steaks, chicken and vegetables great, but if, like me, you are a big fan of hamburgers, beware. :("
2,Received as a gift,"Nearly everyone has seen this grill in action at a friends or on television. It is a quick and easy way to cook without a lot of fat and calories. Sounds great.Well, I've given this thing a whole bunch of chances and what I can say is...Scallops, Sirloin Tips, Steak...all get seared on the outside and stay raw inside. There is no temperature control so its hotter than Hades or cold grill. Bugers taste great, but watch them carefully.Now, cleaning up is a royal pain. The non-stick surface cannot get scratched or its all over...so clean the non-immersable surface with a soft cloth or paper towels. There are nooks and crannies all over the appliance. The white outer surface gets greasy and smudged.Other than eating grass clippings or vegetables, nothing is safe or healthy says the experts. So if you need red meat grilled there are plenty of other options. The novelty of this grill wears out too fast.Sorry George."
5,A knock-out product.,"The small version of George's grill is a bit small for my wife and I. It is more suitable to cook single portions of meat, but nevertheless this is an excellent product. The solid drip pans make clean up easy, while it keeps the fat out of your diet.Meat cooks quickly and it retains most of it's juices. You can also cook vegetables, fish, chicken, pork, beef, etc..., and warm up tortillas! The surface is cleverly angled, which helps drain the grease/fat away from the meat. The recipe possibilities are endless and a clever cook and devise new quick dinners - using this grill.Overall the durability, dependability and ease of cleaning make this a must have for people who are on the go! The nonstick surface makes the clean-up go much faster then cleaning up a pan after a piece of meat was grilled on it."
2,Great until I chewed a small bit of teflon,This product worked great for me for about 5 months until I cooked a chicken breast and when eating it chewed on something that felt like dirt. When I went to clean the unit I noticed a small chip on the teflon coating. It was not scratched - it had simply peeled off. I am in the market for another grill but I will not buy another George Foreman grill. It is not worth the money.
2,Works like something designed by a punchy ex-boxer.,"I just got this today and used it to good chicken breast. The cooking was great but... This may have actually been designed by George Foreman, himself. It certainly wasn't designed by an electrical engineer! There is no on/off switch! You ""turn it off"" by unplugging it, but this produces sparks. Unbelievable that this got UL approval. I solved the problem by first plugging it into a timer with an on/off switch. Or, if you have a strip plug with an on/off switch, this would also work. But it's a stupid work-around. Maybe other models have solved this problem. But besides fireworks problem, it also is not that easy to clean."
1,problem,"Recieved as gift. Thermostat broke. No appliance store or dept. store could provide a new thermostat. Wrote to the company, and was told I need a receipt, which I could not provide. I no longer can use my George Forman GR20. It was great while I could use it, but it is useless without a thermostat.Do you have a solution to this problem. I also threw the box away. I would appreciate any help you can obtain for me. I would like to be able to use the grill again, as it has many great features. Thank You, Rose Poveromo"
2,it reeks after you cook with this!!,"I boyfriends roomate has one of these and everytime he cooks it reeks in the room after he uses it. I mean bad!! Salmon, chicken anything makes me just want to run out of the room and I usually like these things."
4,"May not do much fat-reducing, but a great product anyway","I first saw this grill on an online review show, where they looked at various infomercial products. This one received some of the highest ratings. Mainly because it *does* grill the food nicely, gives it a good taste (somewhat like grilled, but not quite as good), is very easy to clean up (just wipe it down while still hot) and is fast and easy to use. However, don't assume that it really does reduce the fat much. Yes, you will see drippings draining off, and some of that is fat. But a lot of it is just water. Doesn't really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods. Other than that though, a very good product."
3,George Foreman XL grill,If you are thinking of this for a family go the next size up. this is a great grill but not big enough for a family. Can only cook 2 hamburgers or chicken breasts at a time or 1 steak.The food cooked on it is great though and takes so little time.
2,good for a month,bought this little grill and life was great for about a month until the non-stick surface started to flake off.
4,George Foreman Grill,"This is a great product if you like to grill your foods without the hassle of charcoal. I love to eat steaks and can grill them on this grill in about seven or eight minutes. They are tender and very good for you. This is a great buy for the money. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a way to eat healthy foods in half the time. The non-stick surface is always easy to clean and can be cleaned in about five minutes with a wet rag. What else do you need, good food and an easy to clean grill. My hat is off to Mr. Foreman for this great product."
3,Is there a cookbook?,I had a grill given to me by a friend without instructions. I am wondering if there is a cookbook or a manual that I can purchase. I have tried the grill a few times and really like it but would like some instruction about how long to cook things for.
3,Hard as a rock inside,"Nice shoes. The padding inside the shoe is minimal and not at all ""squishy"". Bought size 8.5. Wish I had bought size 9."
5,comfortable,"Very comfortable pair of shoes. They run a little bigger than the size says. Very good quality. I'll be wearing these for awhile, I'm sure."
2,too small,Someone said the sizes run big. But these run small! I've been an 11.5 my whole life. And I've warn pumas my whole life. Suddenly 11.5 is too small for me.I don't think my feet have grown so be careful. I was really disappointed.
3,Not like I remember,"I became a fan of the suede Pumas in the early-to-mid 90's, they were absolutely wonderful, but then I couldn't find them anywhere until now. Unfortunately these are not the same shoes I remember. The tongue is a thin piece of fabric (I remember the tongue being filled with cushion and being fat). They also just don't ""feel"" the same (I remember them being loose fitting).I didn't have a pair in the 80's but they seem like an 80's style to me."
2,bad quality. don't know why,Left shoe got a hole after 2 months. First time something like this happen to my Puma's. Other ones were okay.
5,Cool shoes,These shoes are so comfortable. I can wear them all day. So they make good walking shoes. I recommend it.
4,Puma Shoes,"Nice Shoes, Atleasr found the quality i was looking for but was little unhappy about the color i recieved.Wanted the Dark Blue but got the Royal Blue."
4,Great shoes overall,"The only shoes I buy when i want to spend money on shoes are Puma. I got them in red, and they are really red. They look darker in the pictures, but these things are bright. Which is cool because i wanted some bright shoes. The only problem i have with them is that a lot of times the sizes are off. I have around 10 pair of pumas or so, my sizes range from 8.5 to 9.5. I usually wear a 9. I ordered these in 9, I probably should have ordered them in 8.5. I think from now i will not order Pumas over the web, because I never know if they are going to fit right. My suggestion would be to order them a half size smaller, but that may just be me..."
5,An Excellent CD,If you are a fan of Jan Garbarek you will love this CD. In many ways it is a different recording when compared with his others. Johnson's subdued organ is the drone that Garbarek solos over with his traditional cutting and piercing style of play. It is an ambient recording that has a gothic quality to it. Highly recommended!
5,The ONLY dog food which did not upset our Mastiff's delicate little tummy,"We tried virtually every other dog food product with little luck, our doggie just couldn't handle the stuff. Although hard to get from many sources, Precise Sensicare Lam and Rice (along with sliced chicken breast) was about the only thing that our little 150 pound pup could tolerate. The manufacturer is short on local availability (their list of vendors is hopelessly out-of-date) but it's accessible via this source. If all else fails with a delicate bellied dog, Precise may come through for you pet too."
3,Its a slow but devastating story about the early west,"I just watched this film. It was unrelenting, a story of the rough circumstances prostitutes endured in the West a little more than a century ago. Its a woman's story, almost totally without a male point of view. The men are represented as beings who mostly just mumble and play cards. Their voices are heard often muttering on the soundtrack. We can't make out what they're actually saying. Representing the guys as stick figures helps emphasize in what reduced and lonely circumstances the prostitutes inhabit their dance hall and saloon world. There are no women who are not prostitutes in this early western town. Just as the men have little regard for the women, the women think little of the men. I think this may be a fairly truthful accounting of the West before it was civilized. The film has got me thinking about how desperate male-female relationships may have been in America not all that long ago."
5,So much fun!,"We love Killer Bunnies (and Kinderbunnies, too) and each expansion throws us for another loop- we love this game and play it often!"
5,If you have a 5 year old kid like us...,"This is a very good choice since there is something for all of you. Funny and entertaining. Actually same is true for all of the ""Veggie Tales""."
1,DVD did not work,This was the second copy of the Veggie Tales: Holiday Double Feature that I purchased. The first did not play correctly (disk skipped and would not locate menu) so I returned it. This version did not work either. I tried it in 3 DVD players. Would not recommend buying!
2,Sort of disappointing,"I bought this because I was tired of going through cds while I drove. Seeing as my car in iPod incompatible, I bought this adapter after hearing such ""great"" reviews. I was slightly disappointed on the first day of use. I only seemed to have three radio station options: one has way too much static, the other still had a little static, and the third, well, didn't have that much static.I live in LA, so when I'm sitting through traffic, I'll notice that sometimes when I'm rocking out to my music, mid-song there will be static interference and sometimes I'll catch a glimpse of the gospel radio station that I have to tune my radio to just to listen to my iPod (which is really wierd if, say, I happen to be listening to some death metal band).I've only had this for a month, and my experiences are only getting worse. A couple of days ago, I noticed that my iPod was no longer charging when I had it plugged in. I wish I still had my receipt so I could return this damn thing :("
2,Does not work with the iPhone (FM transmitter a NO GO),"Bought this mostly to use as an FM Transmitter for my iPhone after reading that it does work on the Monster cable website if the iPhone is put into Airplane mode. Well, like most Monster cable products we were lied to and another expensive mistake and disappointment. Charges the iPhone fine, but will get NO music transmitted to the car stereo in any mode. Granted I know that there is no FM transmitter made exclusive for the iPhone right now, but Monster says that it would work on their site and obviously it doesn't. Just a warning to potential iPhone users there looking for a FM transmitter. Better off just waiting I guess and currently anticipating Griffen Tech's iPhone FM transmitter...Gave it 2 stars just because it a.) does charge the iPhone w/o problem (my older Keningston unit would reboot the phone and b.) works fine with my iPod mini and iPod photo."
5,A lifesaver!,"I'm actually in Iraq and this thing is a lifesaver! I use it everyday while driving around this place and without this, I would have to listen to endless hours of Armed Forces Network radio which is horrible. A good tune once in a great while...now with this...great tunes all day long. VERY tough as well since its been subjected to hours of extreme heat and more dust than you could imagine. sure it was not made for this specific purpose but it sure does work well. I had another FM Transmitter and it died within a week. This has worked just fine for over 5 months now."
1,What a hassle...,"This product is more of a hassle than fumbling with CD's while driving.Here's why:1. Even with full FM tuning capability, alot of interference and static.2. LED display is very, very dim (you would have to cast a shadow over the display with your hand in order for it to be visable).3. Poor button design on LED display (preset station can accidently be changed by the slightest touch).Only positive feature is that it charges your ipod...big wow!"
2,Constant whine/static,"I have been searching long and hard for the right FM transmitter. Unfortunately, this is not it. While I like the design (a cord rather than a ""dock"" that ends up rotating and losing contact in the DC jack), the sound quality is horrible. It didn't matter whether we allowed it to scan and select its own station, or we went to one that has been tried with other FM transmitters, there was a constant whine or static. Annoying and very distracting from the music quality.So, back it goes and my search continues."
1,Monster iCarPlay,This product was defective right out of the box. I threw it out when it ceased to work on day 2 and bought a Belkin. Don't waste your money.
2,Poor Quality Product,"This product was a disappointment. After about a month or so, it stopped recharging my iPod. There was often static that interfered with the music. Also, the radio stations often cut into the signal, overpowering the music. I had the product approximately two years when it stopped working. No reason why, it just ceased to work. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody."
2,Disappointed,FM transmitter portion seem to be a design issue. I understand that the FCC limits power out of these little things but I had trouble getting a reliable signal on any stations. Granted my radio is quite old (1992) but I would have expected a better result. This one will likely end up not being used much at all. My recommendation is for you to save your money and patience for better possibilities like a radio with a front jack or better a bluetooth connection.
3,"Works great with 3g or Ipods, does not work with 4g","This item would have recieved higher rating but DOES NOT fit my 4G IPhone, but does work well with a 3G phone or Ipod. Good sound and charges as well."
4,Monster iCare Wireless Car Player,"This is a great product. I was skeptical purchasing this, but it came within a couple of days and I immediately hooked it up. Instructions were simple and within minutes I was hearing music from my IPOD. I live in a rural area, and I was concerned about frequencies and interference, but I had none of those issues. In short a great product and also at a great price......half of what other suppliers where charging for the same item."
3,monster,i bought this because monster always makes good products and it says it charges also... i have an ipod touch 3rd gen and it does not charge it. save yourself some money and get the universal monster transmitter. Other than that it is a great product...
2,frustrating,I can't see the lighted display in the daylight although it shows up great at night. It's so annoying (I need to find new stations as I travel) that I haven't used this much and went back to the original iCarPlay (not iCarPlay PLUS) which is easier to see AND use and gives the same quality sound.I tried to set new stations as presets before I left home one day only to find that the thing is ALSO broken (button 'stuck' and can't be used) from the little I did use it.Not happy with this purchase. I liked the original product well-enough for what it's worth.
1,my review on this newer monster icarPlay,"I am an ipod user, I have owned a monster Ipod FM Transmitter for so long, when this model came out, i decided to go ahead and purchase it and so i did just few months ago, I have been nothing but extremely frustrated with it, it keeps on disconnecting, imagine having your Ipod playing and suddenly everything is static, your Ipod is completely disconnected, the cable lights disappear and guess what there is absolutely nothing you can do but to unplug the cable, wait for good few minutes then connect it again and pray that electricity will run through it this time.the previous model was nothing but the best i have seen so far."
1,...,It worked fairly decent for the two months I had it before the wires snapped inside the casing and the audio went kaput. I pretty much just have a charger now.
3,Won't charge Ipod Touch 2G,Transmits FM well but won't charge Touch 2G. Would be perfect if it charged larest generation Ipods and iPhone. I should have done more research before buying the product. Had originally bought Griffin itrip from Amazon but then canceled when it wouldn't ship for 6 weeks.
1,Piece of Junk! I actually rate it 0 stars...,"I bought this from Amazon as a gift to my husband who was out to sea so he did not receive it until he got back a couple of months later. When we tried it out, it only worked on one speaker in his car. So we thought maybe it was a problem with his car but when we tried it out in my car, the exact same thing happened! It's too late to return it so we're stuck with a $50 piece of junk that we can do nothing with. Very unhappy with the purchase!"
3,Not the best,"This is not the best FM transmitter I have used, but it works pretty well most of the time. I had a Kensington FM tranmitter (that was stolen) that worked much better. I live in a metro area, so it is somewhat difficult to find open stations; I have to change stations at least once on my way to work most days. That being said, I used it while driving 500 miles this past weekend and rarely had to change the station."
4,New Conditions,The product arrived in excellent conditions & working perfectly! I'm very happy with that!! Oh and arrived in 3 days!!! God Bless you. Fabiola
4,"Very Good Product, But NOT Perfect","This wireless FM transmitter from Monster does an exceptional job playing your iPod's music over FM radio frequencies. However, it must be noted that you have to use low frequency stations to avoid any interference such as 88.1 or some frequency close to that.I've had this product for about a month and have not experienced any problems after I found a good station to use. As far as the sound is concerned, it is very good but not quite as crisp as a CD player's sound. But make no mistake, it is more than respectable.Personally, I think the tape adaptor is the best way to go, but if your car no longer has one like mine, then this is definitely the next best possible way to use your iPod with your car stereo system.Overall, this is a product I definitely recommend purchasing until something better comes out in the future."
2,Not worth the money,"The reception I received while using this was never very good. I tried many stations to try and get the best reception. I ended up going back to the tape deck method. It did charge the iPod which was great, but then one day it fell apart in my hands. The 2 pieces that enclose the connector seperated , and left the part that goes into the iPod exposed. It wasn't worth the $75 I paid for it."
1,Broke after an hour,"I bought one of these to use on a long car trip. It worked wonderfully for about an hour - good audio quality, no problem finding an open frequency, even amongst Chicago's crowded airwaves. Then it stopped working. The LED on the power plug showed that it was still receiving power, but the LEDs that display the FM frequency went dead, along with the audio.Nice idea, but garbage."
2,"Great product, perhaps a bad seller",I had bought this cord years ago and it worked great! But when I had bought it here for 50% off it did not work... So I've had one cord that lasted me for 6 years and one that never worked at all... The person who sold it to me may have ripped me off.
4,Works as advertised.,Constantly need to change the tuned radio station to avoid static. But I think this complication is a result of the nature of the technology - not a flaw in the device itself.
2,Do not buy if you live in New York City,"This product is nice, it charges your phone besides streaming audio to your car radio. BUT, if you live in New York City do not expect to use it for more than charging your phone. When I am in Queens, it works ok, once I start driving across the bridge into Manhattan forget it, too much static."
1,Doesn't work well,There is never a channel to use that doesn't have some static and the channels change constantly upon moving about it really doesn't allow music from an iPod or iPhone to be heard with quality it's embarrassing because it sound like your stereo is bad
2,Works great...for about a week. =(,"My husband bought this for me as a Birthday gift and I loved it! It was simple to use, not nearly as troublesome as my wireless fm transmitter and didn't have much static....Except it quit working after a week. 30$ for a weeks worth of use is hardly worth it. Don't buy it."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I bought this to replace a Griffin iTrip I'd had for a year. The iTrip was cheesy and not very well made, but I didn't have to fuss with the channels all the time. The sound was usually very good or excellent with the iTrip, but with the Monster it's terrible. Bleed, crackle, fade - it does it all.I am driving the same routes and yes I read the directions and have no problems operating it.The digital display is nice, and I like the lighted buttons. It's easier to use then the iTrip when you are switching channels but that's it. Nothing else about it is better, or even comparable."
1,crapped out after a month,"Completely stopped working, I tried everything to get it to work but it just died. I have tried multiple FM transmitters, and wasted a lot of money trying to play my ipod/iphone through my car's audio. None of them work. Just spend the money to get a new radio with an auxiliary input."
2,Monstor iCarPlay Wireless,"While this Monster unit is OK, it's just that. I bought it on a friend's suggestion. I plugged it in and it will not tune below 88.1. The FM dial on my car goes to 87.5. It is silent at that setting. The Monster unit is not able to lock in or find a silent station in Nashville, TN. I get a lot of interference while playing the ipod. The only true way to get good playback is to use the cassette player connection if your car has a cassette player...most don't these days because of the shift to using CD players only. Another idea is to have control of your antenna. If the antenna is down the unit works just fine. If you have a set antenna in the extended position and cannot lower it then you're out of luck with this unit."
3,Car Stereo Adaptor to play mp3 files,"I need more time to evaluate this device, which was purchased to save me the bigger expense of converting my current car stereo unit that doesn't play mp3 files. I tried it only once so far, and noticed the sound quality is significantly reduced, similar to the difference when playing a CD versus the FM radio. But if I find a stronger FM station in my area keeping the transmission consistent, who knows, it may just suffice for the time being, while I'm also frustrated with CDs too, those that deteriorate, with the addition of some local area fine dust getting into the player. These problems force me to reminisce about vinyl records when they used to skip, though CD players are not so cooperative by comparison. You can't give them the old Fonzie tap to get it back on track again."
1,Horrendous,"Product returned, tried with multiple iPods, cars, and in different parts of the country. Everywhere there is a quite noticeable buzz on an channel used. Do not recommend."
2,wish I knew before,"This product was specifically purchased because it was advertised to charge your Ipod while using, which I have found not to be true for my Ipod a new 5th generation. The transmitter part works fine in rural areas."
5,Monster fm transmitter works great.,"The transmitter sounds decent, it seems to lose some of the highs but i expect they do this to try and cut back on the static. It is not cd quality but sounds a bit better than the radio. If you are looking for high quality sound a transmitter is not for you, but if you need a cheap and easy way to listen to your ipod this monster cable works great. Also you might want to make sure there is room to plug it in before you buy. I drive a 330i and it is a very tight fit."
1,iPhone 3G and Touch owners must buy a different product,"Monster has released a new version (iCarPlay Wireless 250) that charges the newer Apple devices. The product here being dumped at a super-low price will play iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch, but will drain their batteries."
1,not as advertized,"This product is advertized to be compatible as a charging unit for the new generation iPod Nano. Well, it's not. The FM transmitter is OK as best. The receiption is great if your not moving. No matter what radio station I choose. When driving, the reception fades in and out. So, the iCarPlay I received won't charge my Nano, and the reception isn't great. The price was right, but as far as the product goes, I'm quite dissatisfied."
2,Great Product but does not charge new ipods,This is a great value for the price. This is very easy to set up and use. This does not have the best sound as would a cd but works. The only down side to this product is it is listed as transmitter/charger and it does not charge the new ipods!
3,Quality met my expectations,"My car only has a radio, no CD nor tape. Therefore I need it smt like that just to play the favorite music. I got what I actually expected, quality is not the best but at least I enjoy listening to my favorite songs. Most of the time it works without static so I can say I am pretty satisfied with the product."
4,It works well,"I love my Ipod, I don't realize me driving with out my music, with this transmiter I use my Ipod in any car, when I travel I rent a car and I can use my Ipod everywhere I am.You charge your Ipod while traveling, and when you are out of your car, it's charged, now you don't have to carry the Ipod charger with you.The sound is good, is not the best quality, but this is becuase you are transmiting thru FM not in digital way, but its ok. If you want more fidelity you can chose an original conection to your car stereo.A good option to have 3 progamable preset stations"
2,Product ok,"The product itself was ok, but I'm not impressed with the company it came from. I purchased two at the same time. They both came from etronics in plastic bags with instructions to a different model of monster icarplay directions. . . no manufacturers box. One of the two didn't work. In order to exchange they insisted in the directions that it must be returned in the manufacturers box. and that you pay the shipping for the return. Although I got a good price for each, because one was broke and I was unable to return I ended up paying what I could have paid at the store."
1,ANTOnline is a HORRIBLE COMPANY,"I ordered an iCarPlay from ANTOnline from Amazon, and the item I received was damaged (it was broken into 4 separate pieces when it arrived), and ANTOnline refused to refund or replace the item. Read this company's return policy before you buy. Their customer service is horrible. Buy this product elsewhere."
1,Poor sound quality,We have had an itrip before and this product does not perform as well as the itrip. You only have 3 stations to choose to have it broadcast from. Maybe it is because of the limited station selection but the audio is very poor. The music played through this is not enjoyable to listen to.
3,Pretty good,It successfully plays your music over an FM signal in your car...But it does not charge the newer ipods/iphones..Which is disappointing
1,Not even worth one star,"Horrible product. Purchased, but did not use right away. When I hooked it up, was on a trip and unplugged the IPOD - by the third time the plug fell apart. Couldn't be fixed.... Not worth it. Was horrible sound too. I e-mailed the company - I did of course figure since I waited too long to use, not replacable or anything... basically got a reply .... not returnable. No apology for the defective product... I will never purchase from that seller again and definitely will not purchase a Monster product."
5,The best there is!,I have had one for years. I picked one up for my wife. She had another brand that wasnt even close to the quality of this one.
1,Garbgae,"This is my 1st item from Amazon that has disappointed me. It doesn't work.It did not come damaged or anything, it lights up.. but it just doesn't work. I'm assuming some of these work for other people, but I would not recommend anyone this particular product."
2,FM Transmitter,This product is very hard to use and does not allow user to manually control the available open dial numbers. You have to continually press all three buttons to get the +/- up and down.I would have not purchased this item if I new it was this difficult to program. I may still return it as defective.
1,Defective Product after 3 or 4 uses... DO NOT BUY!!!,"Purchased product in January after reading some decent reviews, went to use it over the weekend and its dead. No power going thru the unit at all. Definately is the unit and not the car as I checked the power source with a volt meter and also by using the GPS and phone charger. Defective product or ?? And now there is no returns. There goes $30.00. Go elsewhere and by it."
1,How can two of the same transmitters be so different?,"I had my first iCarPlay for 6 years without a problem until the iPod jack started getting iffy late last year. I figured, this one has been so great, why not get another? I was wrong. My replacement one is horrible. I get distorted sound unless it's a song with an insanely high bitrate. I can't get a clear signal half the time even in rural areas (how can I get a clear signal on 98.1 in Washington, DC and not anywhere in central PA?). And if I dare to change presets, my adapter refuses to work (static on EVERY station) even when I know the signal is clear. I'm already shopping for a replacement.EDITED ON 8/8/12 TO ADD: This POS crapped out completely last week after only working for 30 seconds. I replaced it with a much better Belkin."
1,Already broken and I've hardly had for a few months,It's already broken. I can't use this in my car and I've only had it a few months. Not at all happy with this purchase.
1,delicate plastic junk,"The plastic housing around the connecting pin broke within a week of usage. I'm pretty disappointed, I thought a brand like monster would have had a better product."
2,too weak for cars with roof antenna,"build quality is decent. plastic moderately thin, but cables are nice and supple. full frequency adjustability is a must. however, in our vehicle, which has the antenna mounted above the trunk, it just doesn't have enough transmission power to push clear signal to the antenna. My wife is disappointed, and there wasn't a single way I could position the transmitter, cabling, or ipod for the signal to become clear.I suspect it would work better in a vehicle where the antenna is on the front fender or hood. not good for us. too bad-- it's now just a fancy charging cord."
2,iPod charger and FM transmitter,"This is a great idea, but I'm a little disappointed. It is very difficult to find reception that does not include static. I've gone back to my old tape adapter."
5,Bigfootrocks,"Works great in our area (rural, not a lot of FM stations). Easy to tune, stations come in clear with very little hiss or background static. Would purchase again. Reviews I've read said it wouldn't charge the Classic 120 gb, but it charges mine.Bigfoot"
2,poor quality,"I had this product for about a year and it worked okay (not great audio quality, but it worked) and then it started falling apart. The wires around the charger became exposed and then it stopped working entirely."
4,Good,"The product works fine. I am not sure if the Ipod touch has the same problem as the Iphone, but the Iphone will not allow the device to charge the Iphone while it is plugged in. However, the rest of the functions work fine. This is a great deal for the price. The manufacturers cannot help it if Apple continues to insist on performing at a petty level."
2,MONSTER FM TRANSMITTER FOR IPOD,"I BOUGHT THIS ACCESORY FOR MY CHILD'S IPOD. THIS UNIT STATED IT WILL CHARGE YOUR IPOD WHILE PLUGGED INTO YOUR CAR. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS STATEMENT WAS FALSE. I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ACCESSORY TO CHARGE MY IPOD WHEN AWAY FROM HOME. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT THIS MONSTER UNIT!!"
3,DOES NOT CHARGE 4TH GEN NANO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This will play music from your 4th gen Nano .. quite well actuallyBUT IT DOES NOT WORK AS A CHARGER !!!!!!!!!!!It comes up with a message saying ""charging not supported with this accessory""If charging is not soo important to you then this is a good buy"
1,WARNING - Does not recharge your Nano,"The product description lists support for the Ipod Nano. Yes, it will play the Nano, but it will NOT recharde it, which is the only reason I bought it."
2,Not totally satisfied...,"This product is not any more efficient than other FM transmitters, but the reason I chose it was its direct iPod connection. However I realized that it transmits not in stereo but in single channel mono -- either left or right channel. If you listen to the early recordings of the Beatles, you will see (hear) what I mean. And it is very annoying."
1,Doesnt work as described,"I bought 2 of them and both have bad Audio Quality . As it is from Monster , I expected Great Quality but it didn't stand the quality .Easy to install , but lot of disturbance on the channel. I changed to other frequency and it doesnt work that well. I tried other FM transmitter and it worked on frequency were Monster FM transmitter didnt worked.Really disappointed with the Product."
3,"Works like a radio, only if desparate...",Honestly this works and the sound quality isn't horrible. It is like listening to a static-y radio. The installation is super easy but I would recommend just buying a stereo to be honest. I am going to end up buying a stereo for 3 times what I paid for this item with a usb jack on the front of it. Works well if you are desparate.
1,JUNK,"not even close to what I was expecting from monster.granted it was inexpensive but I have already replaced it with the one by accessory power for like $25.The constant ""hum"" and the way it picks up engine noise makes it very annoying on any channel.instant relief when the accessory power one showed up.It's on/off button is also very handy because my outlet is not controlled by the ignition.keep in mind that none of the fm transmitters are great but just rather exceptable."
3,Good for the price,"this is a good FM transmitter for the price. It allows you to program 3 presets on any FM channel. It's not a super strong signal, but it works just like it's supposed to. Seems to work just fine with my ipod classic."
2,Monster icar Transmitter/Charger,The Monster Transmitter/Charger works well except for the charger feature which does not charge while playing my i-pod
2,DOES NOT CHARGE FOR IPOD 5G OR VIDEO,"Does work if you want to listen to music, but not if want something to also charge. I should have looked at the reviews better and not trusted the company selling the product. They did not put an accurate description for what this product is compatible with. I should have know because now when I look at it the page it shows something different in two different spots. Oh, well I learned my lesson."
3,Does Not Charge Nano,"I bought this item for my sister as a Christmas gift for one main purpose, to charge her ipod nano in her car! It plays audio but she already had a device that played audio. She wanted something that would charge and play the audio from her nano. We were both disappointed it didn't charge when the product's features and/or description clearly states ""iPod compatibility: iPod shuffle, iPod nano, iPod mini, iPod video, iPod photo, iPod U2, iPod 4th generation with click wheel, iPod 3rd generation with dock connector"" I read another review that says the packaging has fine print that reads ""The iCarPlay Wireless Plus will transmit audio only for iPod nano 4th generation, iPod touch 2nd generation and iPod classic 120Gb. It will not power or charge these devices."" I think the product is B.S. and I would return it but when you figure the cost of returning it and the restocking fee, it's hardly worth it."
3,Not the best charger,"I bought the Monster Wireless Transmitter and it worked great for a week or two... now the reception is horrible and if the song is even remotely loud, the sound is badly distorted and a lot of static comes through. I don't know if it broke or if I'm in a place that has radio interference, but I wouldn't recommend the product unless its the only thing available like it was to me."
2,Hmm ...,"Hmm ... It's easy to use and reasonably priced. The transmission quality is as one would expect from any portable FM type of device such as this. (That being from ""bad"" to ""fair"".) However, mine inexplicably stopped operating after about a week's normal use. Nothing I tried could unlock it from it's apparent freeze up. I ended up throwing it away and purchasing a digital direct-to-audio system, hard-wired product for my iPod instead. No more ""through the air"" for me, thank you. :-)"
2,Doesn't charge!,"As an FM transmitter, this works ok. There is some hissing but it doesn't bother me much. I like that the LED display is lit and easy to read in daylight, and it's easy to program your own presets.However, I have a 4th generation 8gig Ipod and when I plug this in my screen says something like ""charging is not supported with this device."" I shrugged it off thinking that Ipod puts this for non-proprietary products in case it blows up so it's not their fault. I figured it'd still charge since this is a charger, right?Wrong.I drove 45 minutes today, ipod plugged into this device, and my battery icon dropped from 1/2 to 1/3.I'm giving this 2 stars because the FM transmitter is ""OK"" but the charger doesn't work at all.I'm sending this one back."
2,Does not charge new iPod Nano,"The product is generally a good idea - however it is not compatible with the new iPod Nano... it works for all the older ones its seems, what this means is: it still will connect your iPod so you can listen to it in your car but it does not charge."
1,Don't buy this unit.....,"I'm returning two of these. They are very difficult to plug and unplug from the iphone. You have to press in two side (very tiny) buttons and if you don't press them at the same time, the plug sticks in the iphone. The sound quality is poor at best, due to bleed from local stations. The 3 presets are not always open, unless you live in Death Valley, Az. Why didn't they make the plug like the iphone cord, which just slides in and out without pressing buttons? The connection plug (two tiny) buttons don't function some times when pressed and causes the plug to stick, and it seems like it's damaging the Iphone!! Also, each time I plug the unit into the iphone, I get an error message that says it's not compatible with the Iphone, but it seemed to charge and have normal functionality? I'm not sure why?? I will never purchase anything from Monster again. I'd rate it lower than 1 star if it was an option."
1,"Terrrible sound quality, non-intuitive tuning....avoid","Major issues with this product:(1) Sound quality is terrible. Can't overcome natural FM static. If you're old enough to remember a ""portable transistor radio"" or ""AM Top 40"" radio....then you'll know what the sound is like. Extremely low fidelity.(2) Tuning is non-intuitive. See those ""+"" and ""-"" markings next to the three pre-set buttons? Well, they don't mean a thing for tuning to a vacant frequency until you press and hold pre-set button number three. Then when the LED starts blinking, you have about a 50/50 chance of it either continuing to the unused frequency you're trying to tune to, or simply stopping someplace along the way.A disappointment all around. Back it's going to the place of purchase...."
3,Does not support iphone 3G,"I bought this because another reviewer posted that this works with iPhone 3G. Beware, it does not, nor does it work with the 3GS.It does not even go into airplane mode - just says that this device does not support charging. The FM does work, but is not useful if you can't charge the unit."
1,Monster FM Transmitter,The item received was not compatiable with the IPOD Nano 4th generation for charging the IPOD. Mis-information with the item description on Amazon. Went thought alot of trouble returing the unit and still have not received a refund; Just alot of grief. Beware when you purchase an FM Transmitter for an IPOD from Amazon.
2,somewhat works,"the main problems i have with this player is that it doesn't charge my ipod. i have the newest version of the nano and everytime i plug it in it says ""charging not compatible with this device."" it's very irritating especially considering the fact that the only reason i bought this was for my 8 hour long drive to college i'll be having this fall. another issue is that it can get really fuzzy. it's not horrible but you can definately hear the static in the background."
3,mobile gateway,"I have had this product for 2 weeks. I works great here in kuwait with my IPOD. Tried it in THE US, Too much static from urban areas. Overall great product for areas without a lot of urban interference."
2,I don't like it,"I've used a few different FM transmitters with my ipod and this one worked just as well as any of the other's I've tried as far as sound quality. The wiring on this product frustrated me endlessly though. Between the ipod and the plug there is around three feet of wire with the fm control/transmitter piece right in the middle. I found that the wires were constantly in my way and slipped in between my seat and the center console smashing the wires and the control buttons. I also found the buttons irritating and impossible to operate while driving. The three buttons work as preset stations and if you hold down one of them for several seconds you can scan through all the stations. I really don't like the buttons. They're close together, and constantly bumping up against things changing the stations."
1,Stinks,"I had the Monster transmitter for maybe two months before it started pausing randomly every time I went over a bump in the road... Super disappointed, especially for $79. Pass on this one."
1,Stop!!,"No Good. Bought this one because I liked that fact that it's a charger as well, big mistake. Used for about a month before it fried the USB port on my iPod. The sound quality is also mediocre at best. Don't do it."
2,Not for me!,I had an iGriffin and had no problems. It was stolen so I purchased the Monster iCarPlay. The transmission is weak and fades out no matter what station you select. The presets were difficult to set. I am going to buy another iGriffin.
3,"Like product, but crashes my iPod","I have no problem finding an FM station that allows me to hear my iPod over the radio. My problem is that when I turn off my car with my iPod still plugged into the iCarPlay my iPod crashes--goes completely dead, and I have to re-boot it. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, or if it's my car or the iCarPlay. If it wasn't for that problem I would give this product five stars. I'm still trying to figure it out, but if you know the solution, please post it. Thanks!"
2,Description was deceiving,I purchased this item thinking I was getting aMonster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod. Although the player works very well it is not a charger. I am very disappointed. The title of the item was very deceiving.
1,Product not as described,This product does not charge the 4th gen Ipod Nano. In the Amazon description it said that it was compatable with the 4th gen but did not say anything about not charging it. I had to return it to the seller for a refund.
1,Does NOT charge 4th Gen 8g iPod Nano,Was not stated clearly in description so now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Why can't sellers just be up front about this stuff?
2,Monster should remove its name from this item!!,"I have always been a Monster fan, so I bought this based on Monster's reputation. What a shame! This transmitter has interferences even in areas where there are very few radio stations. It's just not possible to get an almost clean sound with this device...nowhere!!!"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,This item works as it says but it is much harder than I thought trying to find a unused radio station to listen to in my area. I guess it does work better if you live in a rural area not so close to the city. Have not got much use out of it and when I do get it to work it only last for a few minutes before the static over powers the music. It's not that the product is bad it's the technology that's bad. I have no tape player so I either just burn CD's or thinking about buying a new stereo with IPOD controlls.
5,Excellent product even in the city,"I am very happy with this Purchase. There are a few spots of slight interference, but overall the sound quality that I get is very good. I live in Midtown Atlanta so there are plenty of radio frequencies around to mess up the sound quality, however I have had very few problems."
3,great doing business,"shiped on time, no problems with amazon. monster cable works great for the money.."
1,Poor perfomance,"I thought to get good assistant while driving in face of this device and experience a great disappointment as it does not perform as advertised. First at utmost, the device have bad transmission and music which plays from your loudspeakers is mixed with white noise what makes it almost unbearable to listen. Would strongly advise to refrain from buying it."
3,Works Ok. NOT NEW.,Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod works OK. I have no complaints about the functionality of the item.I'm angry with the seller. I bought a NEW item and receive a used one.
4,Love it,"I love this product. It charges and transmits. You can program preset stations and change them if you need to. I used mine for several months straight without any problems before it ""walked off"". But I will definately be gettin another one."
1,Transmitter,The product was crap... The first one stopped working two days after I received it... After I sent it back I finally received my 2nd one and it's worse then the first one.. I wouldnt recommmend this product to anyone..
2,terrible reception,"Between my husband and myself, I've had four or five FM transmitters for iPod/iPhone. This one has the worst transmission power of any of the units I have tried. I live in the country and there are plenty of clear stations- but none of them sound good with this Monster FM transmitter. They sound static-y and weak."
2,"Monster It's Not, More Like Weak Worm","It's ironic that the Monster name is on this product. I don't know if this is the ""Monster"" from Monster Cables, but that's what this transmitter could use. I'll give it 2 stars because while it worked, it worked well. BUT, the wiring is very cheap and not durable. We had intermittent signal breaks within a year of light use and careful storage. Soon, only the left channel. Perfectly good transmitter is now garbage thanks to skimping on the cable. Not gonna get any repeat purchases from this customer."
1,"worked well, WHEN IT WORKED!","i bought two of these, one for my husband and one for myself. they worked great for a month and a half to maybe two months, then they both eventually quit on us!! the item is now being used solely as an iphone charger instead of a music transmitter. very disappointed."
2,Decent for the country...,"This works fine in very remote areas, but if you're in an urban area with a lot of radio stations, you have a hard time finding an empty channel.Its also difficult to change channels and set the presets."
2,"Bought 2, 2 Broke.","I had one of these for probably a year or so, and it was generally pretty great. Unless you were in a big city with lots of radio traffic (like Chicago, for example), it worked well 95% of the time. I used to drive around a lot, and I loved getting to have a huge mix of my iPod music in the car with me at all times. Sadly, one day, the transmitter just stopped working with a little pop noise, like a fuse blew. I was VERY sad, because I was so enamored with listening to my iPod all the time. So, I bought another one (FYI--at the time, they were around $70 at Best Buy, so it was a big investment). Would you know, it died within 2-3 months in the exact same way.Monster will not be swindling me out of more money any time soon, no matter how badly I want my iPod music again!"
2,iCarPlay Fail,"I bought the Monster iCarPlay wireless FM Transmitter to replace an older model I'd bought about 4 years ago. Testing this equipment on a 10-day road trip was miserable as it was near impossible to find a station that had clear reception to the transmitter. If I'd known this, I'd have never bought this and relied on it to keep my iPod connected for this trip. Using it around town is a bit better but is still hard to find a clear station that will stay stable beyond a 10-mile radius. Also, this came with no instructions. It took a bit of frustration and multiple attempts to change the channel (from the three presets) before I could figure out how to move the channels up and down one-by-one. Buy something else if you're looking at this. As for me, I'll be looking at direct connections to my car stereo and just skip the FM transmitter altogether."
4,"Great clarity and power, will not charge newer iPods","I have one of these for my old iPod click wheel and it is terrific! It would actually over power similar battery powered devices in my friends vehicles when I drove behind them. It also allows you to use any radio station to listen to your music so you can always find one that works.However, I bought one recently for my fiancé who has an iPod nano video (2009) and it will not charge it; there is even a message that shows up on the iPod screen saying ""Charging not supported with this device"". But other than that it still works great, she just has to charge the iPod once per week or so to keep it working.Bottom Line: Buy it if you have an older iPod or you don't care about being able to charge a newer one while you drive. The sound quality and power can't be beat!"
3,Its okay,"I got this specific brand and one to use with my ipod touch in the car because my sister had one and all she did was rave about it. However, mine isn't that great. I get static a lot and I accidentally got the the one that does not support charging so when I use it in the car my ipod is just wasting battery. Be careful you read all the info and details before buying."
3,Doesn't fully work with IPOD Nano,This transmitter worked fine playing the music from an IPOD Nano but did not work as a charger for the Nano which was one of the main reasons for purchasing the product so I had to return it for a refund.
2,does not charge ipod touch.,The gadget works as a fm transmitter but not as a car charger for ipod touch. I returned the item due to that.
2,decent,I don't like this product. You have to turn your radio up really loud to hear the music. If you have a cellphone near by it will make a buzzing noise through the stereo. It isn't very easy to use or find stations.
3,ipod auto player,Works great once you find the stations that work best for you. Was surprised this version did not charge the ipod while playing. My earlier version did charge while playing.
4,it's a good product,It works well. I think it's a good deal. It has 3 different memory slots to program almost any station into. The only thing I wish it could do is automatically find an open station. If you want that I believe you have to buy a more expensive transmitter. For the money it gets the job done.
2,Not Recommended,"Don't buy this item unless you are sure it is compatible with your ipod, and don't buy it unless it is cheap. It plays the music from my ipod nano 5G, but doesn't charge it. It's not very easy to figure out how to use, and when you do figure it out you will be disappointed that the station display is hard to see night or day and switching stations sucks. The red display is too dull, and the 3 button preset stations would be better off replaced with 2 buttons plus/minus to manually search for stations. Also, whose idea was it to have buttons to release the pin connector from the ipod? People who don't know you have to push the buttons to release it won't push them and will just pull on the thing!! I would recommend buying a griffin or a belkin instead."
2,Weak FM Output and Poor Audio,"I have owned this iPod FM transmitter for about 11 months and have used it while driving thousands of miles through many FM radio markets. In urban areas this unit is not useable, because, despite the availability of the three FM presets, you can't find open FM frequencies in urban areas, and if you do, the unit's FM modulator is not strong enough to overcome adjacent channel interference from city FM radio powerhouses, and typical poor car stereo FM tuner performance (selectivity).If you live in the country this unit's FM performance is just fine, unless of course you regularly travel to a nearby urban area.Also, my unit ""overdeviates""--the iPpod audio is distorted on loud passages when hooked up to my Dodge Durango with the factory stereo installed. When the FM transmitter is hooked to my Subaru's top-of-the-line McIntosh stereo, the audio is good.I believe this product is overpriced, and should be sold with a caveat: Not useable in and around major cities."
4,Love It! but newer Apple products will not work,"I absolutely LOVE my monster I have used it for my iPod Classic and my 1st gen iPhone. Works great! Charges and plays like its say but... DOES NOT WORK on new apple products.. I've tried the new nano, iPhone 3G and iPhone 3G S... do not buy this if you have one of the newer products. It will still play through your stereo but it WILL NOT charge. Hope this was helpful!"
2,Just not good enough,"I SO wanted to love this thing. I have an iPod that I am seldom without, and my car isn't iPod compatible. I bought a Monster Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger so I could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion. Unfortunately, the thing just didn't work for me.There are 8 preset stations (low on the dial) and if all of them are in use, you're out of luck. I don't live in a huge city (maybe 60,000 with farmland all around), but only two of these stations were available. Although I was able to tune in to my iPod, it wasn't crystal clear. In fact, it wasn't even plastic clear. The static sometimes overrode the music, which drove me nuts. This is like a fax machine - the original may be spotless, but the fax will be a little fuzzy.If you have a cassette player in your car, there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better. If your car isn't iPod compatible and you don't have a cassette player, you're better off just burning a bunch of CD's."
5,Great product for the price!!,"I have used this product for about a month now and have taken it on several 5+ hour trips. It charges my Ipod Nano (Gen 2) without any problems. Also, I haven't had any problems with getting a clear signal in my Forester (which I had problems getting a clear signal from two other similar products)."
2,Charger?????,"very good sound quality, but does not charge my Ipod. It did a couple of times but does not anymore"
3,I liked this one - but it now has problems too,"I've tried several brands of iPod wireless transmitters. Either they burn out or do not work. This one works. Easy to use, and I like that it also charges my iPod when I use it. Would get another one. Someday, all my vehicles will have aux. jacks so I won't need this technology, but until then, this is fine for me.I am adding this update about five months later - I have continued to use this device, but one day the digital display suddenly dimmed - so is now hard to see in the daylight. Also the buttons to change the preset frequencies stopped working. So now I am stuck with the three I originally set as defaults. That works OK here in the country, since I probably will not want to change these much anyway. But I am disappointed I still have not found an FM transmitter I really like!"
4,It's ok.,Got this as a gift. Not perfect but it does the job. In South Jersey I use 88.7fm. Sometimes I get a little static but overall it works. Sound is not bad at all. I'm happy with it.
1,Poor sound quality,"Yes, the biggest problem is the poor sound quality you get from this unit. Then there's the problem of station selection. It gives you 8 possible choices for stations to use. If you live in a large metropolitan area like I do, it is extremely likely that every one of those stations is going to be picking up a signal. Only one of the stations is usable in my area and I still get occasional signals from radio broadcasts.Do yourself a favor and avoid the FM transmitters. If you can't get a direct aux connection to your car stereo system and you have a cassette deck, get a cassette adapter. The sound quality is much better and they're much cheaper too.If you must get an FM transmitter, don't get this one."
2,Crap Product!,If you want to listen to your music with a bunch of static and white noise this is the product for you! I thought this one would be way better than one that I bought in the 90's but I was wrong. Definatley find another FM Transmister!
1,DO NOT BUY,"This piece of garbage LITERALLY stopped working entirely after 1 month of intermittent use. No chance on a refund or exchange b/c the window has conveniently passed. Gigantic waste of money. Search for something else. Don't just read the negative reviews about it like I did and say to yourself, ""oh, that won't happen to me"". BECAUSE DAMMIT IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. IT HAPPENED TO ME. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Did not work as expected,"This device did not work as expected. Each station that I chose it would not work with. There was so much static and my music from my ipod would not play. I returned it, and will get a better one. Not worth the $40 for it."
1,lots of static,"I was excited to see that I could buy what looked to be a highly rated fm transmitter for a reasonable price but have been very disappointed. No matter where I am and no matter what station I use, there is a LOT of static. It sometimes clears up for a few seconds when I hold the cord where it attaches to the ipod but as soon as I let go, the static returns. Not worth the money even though it is cheap."
4,Good product and customer service,"After a little over a year, my Monster iCarPlay died. I called Monster to find out if there was a reset I could try. Against everything I expected, a human answered the phone, transferred me to a simple voice menu where I then was transferred to another human! I was in shock. The gentleman who helped me diagnosed the problem immediately (blown internal fuse) and offered to send me a new one with his apologies! This is what customer service really is.Besides great customer service, its a great product. A friend told me to dump my cumbersome Road Trip to get a Monster. I have since bought several for friends and family as gifts and everyone loves it.Lyn deMartin"
3,Not for audiophiles,"This product works, but it does not do the iPod justice. Because it relies on FM frequencies, it sounds, well, very FM-ish. If you are looking for an inexpensive way to listen to your iPod while on the road, this product will do that. But, if hiss and slight static sounds are bothersome to you, you won't be satisfied.I still use it because at least it gives me ""something"", but am seriously considering investing in getting my car retrofitted the right way to get the premium sound so I can truly enjoy my tunes."
3,Improvement over others,I was relatively impressed. It locks onto stations a lot better than a battery-powered Belkin and that's what matters the most to me. It does not perform all that well in urban areas. But it is enough to get by if you don't have a cassette player in your car.
3,Not great for urban areas,"When I used the iCarPlay I noticed a background hiss and it had interference problems as I drove around. It is probably a good product if you are out of the city. But, if you are in a city with a number of FM stations, try another brand."
2,Died after a year,"I bought this product after reading several reviews online and also after receiving recommendations from friends. It worked great for the most part (major cities like Seattle gave me some problems) and did fairly well...and then it died after only one year and shortly before I was about to make a 10 hour road trip from Florida to Georgia. When I buy an electronic product I would like to know that it will last me for a few years rather than having to replace it on an annual basis.To those customers who highly rated this product more than a year ago, I would be interested to hear what your current recommendation is for this FM transmitter.Is the life expectancy of these things only a year? If so that seems rather ludicrous to me."
1,Two have stopped working for me,"I have had two of these. Monster was nice enough to replace the first one, but the second one has failed as well. First I noticed the display was off. I thought it might have been the dimmer so I tried to 'un-dim' it but to no avail. Without the display I tried scanning stations to see if only the display had stopped working but FM was also shot.The signal strength was high quality while it worked.Also, this doesn't charge an ipod touch or iphone, but it does broadcast through the FM with these devices. (while it lasts). Don't buy it."
3,Plays but does not charge Nano 8G,"This product works well in playing through my FM car radio, however it is not compatable for charging my iPod nano 8G."
2,Not bad sound when it stays connected,"I have the new 120gb Ipod Classic, and have had mixed results with this product. The main issue is that for some reason it will not stay attached to the ipod -- the connector keeps falling out or coming loose and signal is lost. When I do finally get it to stay in, it's nearly impossible to release it. I've tried 2 of them now, and same problem with both -- anyone else have this issue?On the plus side, when I can keep the Monster cord connected to the ipod, I get a pretty good signal and sound. This will do for now, but there HAS to be something better out there short of getting a new car that is wired for my iPod. The search continues."
3,monster icar review,"Works great with my 20gb ipod, far better than the griffin itrip I had, however it said it was compatable with the ipod nano so I also bought one as a gift for my mother and it was not at all compatable. It appeared as if it would work, but absolutely no sound came out of it but static. the griffin itrip which got a lot of static with my 20gb sounded great with the nano so now I need to return my gift!"
3,Nope...doesn't work for Touch,"I received this as a christmas present and was sad to discover that it is not compatable with the iPOD Touch. It will play music, but warnings will display on the Touch that it can't use the cable to charge. I'm fairly sure that it actually DRAINED power from my Touch while it was playing. It sounded awesome though...."
1,Bad Choice,"This item isn't worth the money, poor quality, poor sound, it's just a poor item all around the board."
3,"Works, but not well.","This product does transmit the iPod music through the car stereo speakers, but no matter what channel I select, there is ALWAYS static! Bummer."
1,less than expected,"Perhaps I just had unrealistic expectations, but I haven't been happy with this product. Nomatter what station I choose, the static is obvious and annoying. I wish I hadn't paid money for this poor product."
1,Worked for one day,Got this to replace my older version of this same cable. The cable worked for one day. What killed it was the gold color part that sticks out of the devie - which you plug into your car outlet. This gold surface area conducts electricity which gives power to the cable. I was very disappointed to find my gold conductant stuff wasn't solid. It was painted on. The paint chipped right off and I could no longer use it. My older version was solid (not pained on). Big Waist of Money.
1,Wish I had saved my money!,I wished I had saved my money...... Purchased and received as expected but got a dud. It DID NOT WORK.
1,Did not work,"I have tried a couple different Monster products and they seem to have failed me. Not saying the product is bad, but where I live it was very difficult to get a signal. Needless to say I returned the item."
2,Problem with overheating,"I've tried this in two cars over several days and it works great for about 30 minutes then stops. In each case, the control unit gets very hot. After about six hours, it works great again for another 30 minutes, then stops. Am I the only one with this problem? I'd like to exchange it rather than switch. When this works, it performs better than the Belkin Tunecast in our area."
5,Works great,Excellent shipping and very easy to set up.If you are going out of state just make sure you adjust the stations accordingly since the presets need to be changed.
4,Good Product!,Works fine! I got mine stolen and bought it again. Only thing I dislike is that I get another car's music into my radio so I have to give and space in between but I guess that happens with all the fm trasmnitters. The service from the vendor was good.
2,craaap,"i have to movie it around in my car to find a position for it to sound decent, n theres still a lot of static n the quality is horrible. waste of money in my opinion."
4,Excellent Ipod Transmitter,"This product works just great. Its easy to setup and works with a very good quality of sound - no noticable hiss and crackle or interference.I use it with my old generation Ipods, the Ipod Classic and the Ipod Touch and it works well with all of them"
3,"Hard and inconvenient to program channels, weak signal.","I got this FM transmitter as my 3rd try to find something that would play my mp3s from my ipod through my radio. Like all the others, signals were weak, there was alot of static sometimes, and it wasn't clear. Sometimes you had to juggle the wires or reposition the wires to get a better signal. That cluttered up my console space. I'd give a fair rating because it was good to charge my ipod and the channels that it did work on, worked well. But all other times, it was so so."
2,died,I bought this overpriced car adapter cuz it would charge my ipod and play at the same time. After 2 months it started to die and now it only plays audio out of my car's right side speakers. When I go over a bridge it comes in on all speakers but until then this thing sucks!
2,"It works, but...","It works, but the sound quality is not great. If you are going to use for listening to books, it is fine. If you are going to use it for music, choose something else."
1,Burned out,"I had this transmitter for about a year and it worked pretty good, though the sound could be better. However, the transmitter burned out and now it no longer works. I won't buy another one, instead I will buy another brand."
4,"Good quality, but difficult to unplug","The sound is good, not too much static. But, it can be hard to unplug my iPod from it."
1,Terrible product,"What creates more static?a). Rubbing a balloon on your head?b). Putting 20 pairs of pantyhose in the dryer with no dryer sheet.c). This product.Answer: C.I have three major problems with this product. The first is a huge amount of static that it couldn't overcome. In fact, the static was louder than the MP3 I was trying to play.Second, the station options are written so small on the device, they are very difficult to read. I have 20/20 vision and had to hold it up to my face to read it (not very safe to do while driving!).Thirdly, if its dark out and you yet again have to try and find another station to play over the static, you have to turn the car's interior lights on to read the tiny letters, as they are not backlit.Overall, this is a poorly designed product that does not work well at all.The best experience I had with this product was returning it!"
1,absolute junk,"I bought two and had to return both of them. They had shorts, didn't work, and then died all together."
1,Didnt even Work,"I bought it, plugged it in and nothing not even a light up terrible waste of money thanks alot haha"
3,FM transmission has too much interference,"Too much FM interference when I drove through places where I do not hear the nice music as I expected, yet it is too much trouble to select/set other frequencies to avoid interference. May be Monster should pick a frequency there is no interference possible?"
5,Great,"I bought this thinking would work with my iPhone 3G.. I was wrong.. I haven't had chance use it yet, as the only iPod I have is on my iPhone.. I'm sure it probably works fine"
2,"That static may drive you nuts, cheap cost = cheaply made","FM transmitter came with no instructions and a sticker on bag that says 'use with channels up to 90.1 FM'. So it will not work on any station higher than 90.1. Also, while it will work with 87.9, it is staticky to the point that it will drive you crazy (husband has older one that plays beautifully in my car on same station). The only station I can use it on is 89.9 and we live in suburban phillie area. It does work (and it does charge ipod while playing, which is nice), but there is a lot of static, especially noticeable when you turn up the volume. I can't use it for travel outside of my immediate area, not while driving safely anyway since I would have to constantly change the station and setting.You get what you pay for, so if an FM transmitter seems too cheap, it probably is."
1,False product listing.,"I suppose the product works just that it's not what I wanted. The producted was listed as a transmitter/charger which is what I wanted and why I ordered it. When I plugged it in my car it didn't work. The little lightening symbol (which means it's charging) came up very shortly then went away very quickly. I tried to disconnect and reconnect to see if that would work but it didn't. O don't think it's a defective product just false/wrong advertisment. The main problem is there wasn't any type of sales receipt or return invoice so I'm stuck with a product I never wanted. The ratings are based on the product that was received, really didn't want to rate it but there was nothing really wrong with the device just wasn't what I ordered. Really wanted to rate the seller."
1,Monster (carPlay wireless plus fm transmitter/charger for iPod,It does not work. It was a gift for my daughters birthday and she is so disappointed with it. I would like to return it and get a refund but do not know how to do it.
1,Not that good,when i bought this i thought the radio settings were like the one i previously purchased and they were not it only allows me to hook up to one radio station. This is very limited and overall not happy with the product
3,"Fine, Just Fine","After reading about several transmitters (and realizing that no one really loves any of them), I went with the Monster iCarPlay Wireless because it seemed fairly straight-forward. And it is. It's nothing fancy, and sure, there's some static sometimes, but it seems to work just fine throughout most of Chicago (though I haven't tried it downtown). There's just some initial finangling - it took me a week to find an empty channel I was happy with.My biggest complaint (other than: Why is it we don't have better technology for this sort of thing?) is that for whatever reason, the charger feature doesn't work for me (I have a 4th gen. Nano). Boo."
2,Better than nothing.,"I got this because I have a piece of crap mac that won't burn cds anymore. So, a quick fix to that problem and a lot cheaper than the $600 it will cost to replace the drive...I'll get an adaptor for my ipod. It's better than nothing, as the title states. I've never had any problems with my ipod in the 3 years I've had it, but when I hook it up to this thing it constantly, randomly pauses itself. I can put the headphones back in when I'm at work and listen to it all day and it doesn't pause itself once. But hook it up to this and every few seconds the music stops. It's pretty annoying to have to keep hitting play, but since I can't burn cds it'll have to do. But it doesn't do it with every song... it just randomly selects songs to pause every 5-15 seconds. Whatever. It was only 20 bucks."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"The biggest problem is the poor sound quality you get from this unit. Once a station is selected and I start driving, the signal continues to get worse and I get a lot of hiss and noise. If I move it around it will get better for a few seconds and then sound quality continues to get worse until I turn it off!There's got to be a better design. I do not have the cassette option or the auxilary port.If you must get an FM transmitter, don't get this one."
2,Hard To Read Display,"Audio Quality is pretty solid, however the display is almost impossible to read in most setting however. Pretty much you just resort to seeking one station at a time to find the station you are looking for."
4,Good value for the cost,Got one to replace a belkin car transmitter/charger that broke only after a few months. So far am pleased with the quality and bought a second for my husband.
2,Poor performance,"The Monster iplay Wireless Plus FM tansmitter performs very poorly and is really unusable for any normal use. I bought this to power my ipod and act as fm transmitter at the same time. It charges OK, but the low volume and static on the tranmitter is unacceptable. I have an older model Monster FM transmitter that works perfectly right alond side this one, so its not the application, car or anything else. Don't buy this one."
4,Quality Transmitter!,"This FM Trasmitter is great because you can program different stations into the buttons, which is really nice driving for 4 hours. Usually I drive out of good range of one station and all I have to do is hit the next preset station and I'm good to go!It is a little confusing to set the presets, but not a big deal at all! It has the instructions attatched to the cord so that when I forget, they are right there."
3,4th gen Nano's,"I have used this product for 1 year on my 2nd gen nano. That nano went bad, I now have a 4th gen Nano and the charging function of this product will not work. The transmitter still functions but when you run out of battery life and it's big dissapointment. I don't blame this on Monster it is an Apple change. The cable worked great."
2,Not bad,This product is ok...not the greatest reception as you're driving and get interference and need to keep changing the channels...thought it would work a little better than the less expensive models.
1,JUNK / GARBAGE - DON'T WASTE MONEY,"This thing DID NOT work with either device and is a waste of money. If possible, find a USA made brand. Foreign stuff is just junk. Very very disappointed. If there was NO stars, I'd give it that."
2,Risky purchase,I purchased two.One worked for about a month and then stopped working.The other didn't work at all. Nothing.
3,I'm not sure what to think,"so my first experience with this product was a beat up one i bought from goodwill for $4.00 and it worked perfect even though it was held together with a rubber band. 2 weeks or so ago i decided to buy a new one off amazon. it just died on me yesterday... so im really not sure what to think, I also bought one of these for my room mate at the begining of december and her's seems to be working fine.hope this was helpful in some way."
4,Reno weatherman mystery,"Mike Alger is a TV weatherman who wrote a mystery set in the Reno area. If you like lots of action, and want to know about behind the scenes in TV news, this is a good read."
3,Thoughtful and full of country soul,"So I picked this book from my grandmothers book shelf. What a coincidence huh? The author is known for her Irish cookbooks. While in the midst of one she was writing, brought on fond memories of her and her grandmother. So she decided to write a novel about it. A Slow read, but still worth it. Recommend to anyone who loves their grandmother.~AliShA~"
5,This Book Has Holy Ghost Power!!,"I bought ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed! Devotional"" in 1999 at a book sale at my company and it sat on my bookcase for nearly a year unread and collecting dust until Thanksgiving 2000. At the time, I was in a spiritual valley, full of self-pity and doubt. I do believe God guided me to take Bishop Jakes' book out and read it. Sisters, I read it TWICE that weekend, and became renewed, refreshed, and redeemed. Chapter 16, ""Dealing with Your Cains and Abels,"" was especially uplifting for me personally because Bishop Jakes showed how I was blocking my blessings by continuing to cling to the past and certain individuals in it.Bishop Jakes' spiritual gift, to tap into those who are hurting and need encouragement, is evident throughout this book. Buy it!"
3,A Good Introduction,"This collection is like a Cliff Notes on audiobooks. There is about a one hour summary of each book, which consists of a biography of the author, a look at the historical context, and a brief synopsys of the story. This is in no way a reading of the book, abridged or otherwise and therefore is not as entertaining as an abridged audiobook, but it is very informative as a study guide.The selection of books is quite good, although my list of the hundred greatest might differ considerably. One fault of the collection is that it reflects current academia in the political correctness of the reviews. The comments that result are often downright humorous, but at other times are rather sad.This is a good collection, especially for a commuting student."
2,"Could have been better-- too ""PC""","This audiobook works as a general summary of the works...it is written in an interesting style, is spoken by good readers, and gives lots of relevant background on the authors' lives.If only the author of the audiobook hadn't thrown in an annoying thread of politically correct bias-- i.e., constantly pointing out the bad influences of Christianity on civilization, generally giving other religions such as Islam a ""pass,"" and misunderstanding Christian theology.This audiobook would have been so much better of the author's biases had been less intrusive and his perspective less time-bound."
4,Great little monitor,"Got this monitor rather quickly. Came as advertised, no issues with shipping. Packaging contained those annoying little 'pods,' though.Works great. Maybe a bit too bright, but otherwise a decent monitor.Would definitely recommend this item."
2,Not very happy about this order.,"Ok I purchase this used, and it was only 29.00, but after shipping price, it would be around 54.00. When it arrived it was very dirty and dusty all over, had to use a vacum cleaner to clean it up. The picture seems distorted some aswell. I decided I will use it as a backup monitor just in case my NEC 19"" goes, and just buy a flat screen later or a newer crt. I have to say this order tops my worse orders list. Don't understand why the seller could of atleast clean this monitor up before shipping it in the mess it was in."
2,dell 17inch monitor,"I was very dissapointed with the style and appearance of this item and would like to return it,but did not because it is to heavy for me to lug around, and I did not save the packaging. This is a very old monitor, the color is dark, it has to be resized each time I sign on. I emailed the seller for tech support and got no response as yet. There was no manual or any written help included in the packaging.I would rather have spent the money on a newer model."
5,Aquamarine and Diamond Ring,"At 58 years old, this is my first birthstone ring ... and I am DELIGHTED! I was actually jumping up and down in my seat when I opened the box. It is lovely and was in a cute bag with a little bear as a plus!! This is just an awesome, dainty, beautifully colored Aquamarine White Gold Ring. SUPER!"
1,One use was enough,"After I used the plastic cubes for the first time, I put them in a bowl filled with hot, soapy water. I washed them each by hand, rinsed and dried them off, and started to put them away in the freezer for the next use. Luckily I noticed that one of the cubes had sprung a leak and was only 1/3 full. That means your drink or soap suds may end up inside the cubes. I only used them once! I'm taking time to write this review because I wish someone had warned me about these ""Tropical Flowers."""
2,Too many unsubstatiated statements,"I was not too fond of this book, not because I'm a Malcolm fan, but there are too many conclusions that Perry makes with weak evidence. Such as Malcolm's father (and Malcolm himself) setting their houses on fire, Malcolm's alleged homosexual activity, Malcolm asking the Klan why they allowed Dr. King to live, etc. etc. One could see why Dr. Betty Shabazz (Malcolm's wife)told Perry to get lost!"
2,Approach With Caution,"You have to question what Perry wanted to achieve from this book. He seems to have missed, or overlooked, all of the important issues that Malcolm X stood for.He takes the word of Malcolm's detractors as the gospel truth and diminishes Malcolm's teachings and beliefs by portraying them as paranoid.Perry seems obsessed with highlighting flaws in Malcolm's personality and uses this device to side step the vital lessons which Malcolm was trying to teach - lesson's which still need to be learnt today.By all means read this book, but do so very objectively."
1,not the best edition,"This reprinted edition does not follow the pagination of the original edition. For classroom or academic purposes, it is generally preferable to use the Prometheus Books edition, the Penguin Classics editon, or the Dover edition, all of which follow the original pagination."
1,Wm James& Varieties of Religous Exp.,I fell ripped off.The is book is not as listed.This is other people talking about what James said and wrote. I wanted the book from Wm James. If the book was honest said what it was I wouldn't have bought it.
3,I should but I just can't!!!,I think I should read this book because the subject matter is so dear to me but - ARGH - I've tried and it's sooooo dry and boring! I just can't. Yet. It's still by my bedside. Maybe one day.I even created book study around it and nobody could bear it ...
3,small bag,food is high quality but bag was much smaller than I anticipated which is really my fault because I didn't look close at the weight on the picture
3,Not as interesting,Preview implies a veritable treasure chest of ideas; unfortunately this is a case of the trailor showing all and only the best parts of a movie...
3,"Very neat, but not practical","I enjoyed looking through this book, but the projects in here are not suitable for a home that is not a dorm. A chair made of plastic pop bottles is ugly AND not functional. Who knows what they were thinking.That said, the book itself is well made/bound/printed."
1,Unappealing projects,"I expected this book to show me how to make projects comparable to those found in the ""ReadyMade"" magazine: Practical, attractive projects that make good use out of cast off items. Instead, this book shows projects made out of junk that look like nothing more than projects made out of junk. A coat rack made out of laundry soap bottles looks like a stack of laundry soap bottles. The cd racks made out of shipping cartons look like shipping cartons. I was very surprised to find not one item in the book that I wanted to make.Tastes being what they are, you may enjoy this book more than me. All I'm saying is that you'd probably want to look at a copy of it before buying, to make sure."
3,Trash wrapped up all pretty,"First, it's about book design. Very snappy. Fab binding! And attitude - cute 'ziney commentary. Photos are lovely. And there are scarey factoids about trash and global warming in teeny tiny type. No, you won't find any projects you actually want to make. Most are labor intensive (drill 2 holes through 175 wooden closepegs) and impractical (2 ladders + boards = bookshelves) and ugly (20 sawed-off laundry detergent bottles make a coat rack). That's not the point. By the time you get to the projects that even the authors admit don't work (lounge chair of empty water bottles, deemed too noisy), you realize this book is a bit of a mockery. But its visual appeal sneakily gets the reader thinking about the trash with which we surround ourselves, and what to do with it."
1,Terribly Disapointing,"I bought the book a few days ago, with hope in my eyes, and I'm re-selling it on craigslist today.I can only define it as a ""book for people who shop exclusively at WestElm and have an urge to ""slum it"" by occasionally making things to keep up their egos and illusion of street cred at parties.""So sorry, ReadyMade. You used to be the coolest thing, but you lost your way."
4,good for beginners,"the book is helpful for the beginners.it is benefical for me first to read the information about the raw materials such as glass, wood and plastic;then begin to see the examples. I will apply the lamp out of a colander and a shelf out of ladders projects. the book is benefical for the new perspectives."
2,How to make stuff you might not need,"This book is fun to flip through. I find some of the projects to be hideously ugly, but some look like they would be fun to make. My problem with many of them is that they would require the purchase of the base materials! If the stuff is lying around the house, it's already being used. I was under the impression that this book would contain projects that I could make from stuff that I already had lying around. I don't read ReadyMade magazine, though, so perhaps I just didn't know what I was getting into.I liked the little informational sections on the history of the base materials (paper, wood, etc) more than many of the actual projects. I'll hang on to this, but I'm not sure how often I'll end up making anything described on the pages (if at all)."
2,Not many projects and kinda silly,"The projects are kinda silly and you probably won't build them for you house unless you have multiple triangle packages from fedex and hundreds of yellow page books. The cover and ruler side are neat, but that's about it though."
1,"Magazine's great, book's a misfire","ReadyMade magazine is full of fun and useful projects, but the ones in this book are tacky and ugly. The book itself is lovely, but who wants to make a coat rack out of detergent bottles or a chandelier out of cutlery?"
3,"get the magazine, skip the book","I LOVE ReadyMade magazine, but was disappointed in the book. I just didn't see too many projects that I would want to spend time on. One example is a chandelier made with plastic forks, spoons, etc. Or another is a coat rack made with old laundry detergent bottles. The ideas just didn't appeal to me much. But the magazine is great!"
1,Beware of imitations,"Oh, what a disappointment to an Elinor Glyn fan! Glyn literally invented many of the romantic conventions we see in books today. Her sense of humor and sharp critical eye enliven what might otherwise be rather standard love stories.But here, most of what is truly extraordinary about Glyn has been edited out. The resut is a standard, cut-to-the-chase love story that could have been written by almost anyone. If you are interested in writing your own romance novel, this might be interesting as a study in how to move the plot along, but personally, I read in order to read good writing.And, incidentally, the work in question was not listed as being a sharply edited version. So be careful -- one can only conclude that the reader is supposed to know magically that the Barbara Cartland reissues have been chopped to pieces."
4,Typical Elinor Glyn - fun mind candy,"A typical suds-er from Elinor Glyn. This is not a bad thing - sometimes one wants to read mind-candy that does not require any thought, and Elinor Glyn always fills the bill. And it is always amusing to read something that was regarded as a very racy, risque novel in its time because we saw worse on ""All in the Family"" in the 1970's Not great novels, but great fun. Some unfortunate racial language and views in some places, but this was the early 1900's."
3,Cute.,"This book is cute my 18 month old likes it. It is the popular kids song but with different characters such as the dog, cat, goldfish, and a guinea pig. I wish it completely rhymed because I noticed it does not, but other than that it's a fun book to read. I did find it weird that the Guinea Pig in the story works out..."
1,mini means half the story,"I had the original book from the library and we had fun reading it. I decided to buy a copy for christmas and saw the ""mini"" version. I thought ""mini"" meant smaller, but it really means half the story. The full version starts with 10 cookies, this ""mini"" version, starts at 5.I was very disappointed and returned the book."
5,Fun for the whole family,"This book is loved by our whole family. The illustrations are clever and delightful, while the repeating rhyme is catchy, yet not annoying. My six year old enjoys reading the book to us and my 18 month old loves looking at the pictures and pressing the ""cookies"" as though they are buttons. Most importantly, the book ends on a high note about sharing."
1,"If you want to do something meaningful, try another book","I don't write many book reviews for Amazon, but this book was so terrible I figured I had to. If you want to build your own .Net language and Compiler then you must have some understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of compilers - scanners, parsers, intermediate representation, etc.This book not only skips the required theory, but avoids any technical depth to the degree of being nothing more than 400-page description of a crappy BASIC interpreter the author wrote.Even if you want some lightweight reading on the subject of compilers or .Net in general, there just isn't enough meat here to justify picking this book up off the shelf."
1,waste of paper and $$$,"I have to agree with the ""waste of time"" review below. This book reads like a C-student's CS notes on compiler technology. Having created compilers for other platforms, I hoped that this book would shed some light on compiling to MSIL. Unfortunately, coverage on this and other key topics is quite sparse.In the book, the author refers to Aho, Sethi and Ullman's classic - ""Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools"" (The ""dragon book""). Especially if you're new to compilers, do yourself a favor - forget this second-rate knockoff and get the real thing.Shame on APress's editors and reviewers for letting this one out the door. Shame on me for per-ordering this mess."
1,Please...don't get taken in,"These books are based on poor scholarship and designed to make money from people with low attention spans and poor reading comprehension, because they deliberately advance striking and apparently non-conforming positions.Poor scholarship: generally these types of books advance a thesis only to show that it's possible, not true, and in that they resemble the work of high school book reports. Furthermore it's really NOT very helpful as it barely dives deeper than beginning level. But for beginners, the quality of the material is low & written in a confusing manner. There are much better books than this one available."
4,Excellent,Mr. Nilges presents the subject matter in a clearly understandable text. This book lays the foundation for a .NET compiler design. He clearly has a strong understanding of the subject matter.
4,A book review,"A good book for someone just reading about Proust for the first time. It's a quick read, I think it took me two sittings yet it still gives insight into ""Remembrance"". Great for the casual fan of Proust looking for help in beginning to tackle some of the meaning of the novel."

1,Goofy,"As the spotlight reviewer said, this is a strange, silly concoction of clips spliced together to form, not art, but garbage.I regret I bought it."
4,Pleased with purchase,"Plain and simple, this percolator makes great tasting coffee, 12 cups at a time. I bought mine over a year ago, and it is still going strong. I love the high capacity, and there is just something special about the taste of percolated coffee. I would give this product 5 stars, however the plastic over the push buttons has detached, and the screws at the base of the urn are rusted pretty thoroughly. These parts are not obviously not engineered for a long service life. Since I paid over $90 for this model, I would have hoped for better. However overall, this workhorse of a coffee maker was well worth the money."
1,Warning...poor quality,"This thing brews great coffee during it's brief lifespan. I bought my first one last August 2000 ...and it lasted until November 2000. It started smelling of burnt plastic and then stopped working. Fortunately I didn't have an electrical fire .... Unfortunately this replacement only lasted until July 2, 2001. This time it stopped in the middle of a brew. The coffee was luke warm and it never started up again. We brew one pot a day. ...."
2,Best coffee only lasts a year,"This percolator makes fantastic, hot coffee. It is easy to use, pours well, (not like those cheesy glass pots on drip machines, and I love being able to program it so it brews when I get up. The first one lasted four months. The customer service is poor, it takes forever (months anyway ) to get back. I had to go out and get another maker while I waited. They sent me a new machine, now a year later It's dead again. I love this machine. The only question is do I buy another while this one's in the shop. Or to find something else."
2,Falls apart at one year,I bought this for my husband and within 3 months the buttonsstarted to crack and peel and at the one year mark the plastic top came off. Great coffee for a year. Not worth the price.
2,"Makes great coffee, but breaks easily","I've had two of these percolators in the last 12 months. Sadly, both have broken. They always break in the same spot - at the base of the clear plastic knob that sits atop the lid. The buttons at the base of the unit also have a tendency to crack after a couple of months. However, when working properly, this percolator make a great cup of coffee.With that said, I would not recommend it."
2,don't recommend,"This percolator is a great idea, however ours has gone ""on the fritz"" twice. It just stopped working. The first time we sent it back for repair. The second time it got put into the cupboard. Each time we had to go back to our old, reliable, percolator."
2,". . .When it is bad, it is horrid","I bought this percolator because it was the only one I could find with automatic shut-off. Within one month of owning it, it stopped heating. Believing in the product (when it is good, it is very, very good) and happy with the coffee-making speed, the temperature (hot!), the ease of use, I sent it in for a replacement. Of course, I had to pay to send the machine back. Then it took 6 weeks for a new one to come!!! By this time I had replaced this machine with a really old-fashioned stovetop version. There is no danger of leaving that one plugged in.The product is great when it works, but the company is WAY less than accomodating. They should provide some sort of compensation for the headaches. They do realize they are dealing in coffee makers, right? Who can be without her coffee maker for 6 weeks?"
4,Nice updated percolator,"We love percolated coffee. My husband kept forgetting to turn the old one off so we bought this one. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't override the auto shut-off feature for when you are home, etc. Sometimes because I work a different schedule the coffee is cold by the time I get some. However, the pot is beautiful, easy to set and easy to clean. We love it. I would definitely buy it again! Recommendation to manufacturer to extend auto-shutoff time to 4 hours rather than 2."
4,"Good, hot coffee","We decided to try out a percolator when our drip maker conked out and found this one. It is easy to use; especially like the base where you do not have to plug/unplug all the time. The drip we had never kept the coffee hot enough - I was always zapping it in the microwave. This Farberware percolator keeps it hot and it tastes fresh, even after more than an hour. The automatic timer and turn off features are a real plus for us as well. The only complaint is that you may find some grounds in your cup but that may be due to the type of coffee and/or grind we get. Bottom line: like it and would get it again."
1,see-through top hardly durable,"It may be attractive and intelligently designed and have a durable stainless-steel body, with a high-polish finish with a strong stay-cool handle but if the see-through top breaks (very easily) it's useless."
1,love turned to hate,"I purchased my first pot in 2001 and loved the pot. The coffee would be ready when I woke up at 3:30 am and would be very hot and fresh. After only 6 months I started having problems with the first pot. The coffee was no longer hot. Than the pot stopped working altogether. So, I purchased another one, thinking I had a lemon. Four pots later I realize they all do the same thing, work fine for 6 to 8 months than stop working at all. I will no longer purchase any farberware product.Thank youJudy Billingsley"
5,Percolators,"I have been searching for a coffee maker for weeks now. I've read many reviews about auto drip vs. percolator coffee. Just when I think I've made up my mind, I read a review that changes my mind. Although the reviews stated that auto drip is far better than percolated coffee, I just loved the look of this pot.The good reviews on Amazon swayed me even further. I bit the bullet, and bought the pot. I really do like it. I can't find any major complaints and the coffee tastes great. The only thing not great about it, is that you need to remove the basket after the coffee is done perking. No big deal, but its a hot job! All in all, the pot is a wonderful addition to our new kitchen and matches our stainless stove, fridge and dishwasher just great!"
1,It quit working in less than a year,"The coffee pot was the 5th faberware pot we have had in the past 5 or 6 years, the others were with the removable cord, when we saw the new one in the store with the programable base we just had to have one, as we love the coffee and it is so much better than the drip makers. anyway it quit working and I have been unable to find a replacement in any store that used to carry faberware.also no information as to where to send the unit for repair.We would settle for an old style with the plug in cord if we could find one!"
3,Product Failure,I received the product as a gift. It worked well for the first few months then the plastic window on the top (cap) broke. It sheared right at the nut in the cap. Then the pot stopped working altogether. I just recently after about a year got a chance to bring it to repair shop. They are telling me the insides are rusted and not worth repairing. Is there anything that can be done?
2,"Great Idea, Needs Some More Work","Bought this coffee maker and shortly returned it. The unit is not at all""user friendly."" The LED is not illuminated and is very hard to see not to mention just setting the time and the actual brew time is VERY difficult. There also is no way of knowing if and when the coffee has been brewed because there is no indicator light and so the only sure way to determine that is by touching the pot which could possibly lead to some nasty consequences. I also question the integrity of the top of the pot because the clear knob is made of plastic rather than glass. I canimagine after numerous brewings this might crack. This unit needs some more work...good idea though."
3,Faberware FCP512S 12-cup percolator,"I like the cordless pot, it's handy for serving but the coffee pours slowly and ""glugs"" making it difficult to serve. It's also difficult to remove the basket once the perking is done if you want to keep the coffee hot without getting bitter. Otherwise, it brews very fast and looks good on the counter."
2,The NEW Farberware vs.OLD Farberware-,"For those that care about the Farberware products of past, I drove by the former Farberware plant in the Bronx last week. It's a pile rubble. History. From what I understand, Farberware products have been made in China (or somewhere outside US) for several years now.Now I don't know if this has anything to do with the quality of Farberware products - but they don't seem to be holding up to the Farberware products my parents swore by.Despite the mixed review of this coffee maker, I purchased it. It lasted about a year. I love the design, especially the electrical base which allows for the transport of the hot pot of coffee without unplugging. I also love perk coffee. Unfortunately, the machine did not hold up.The glass bulb at the top is no longer glass, it's plastic. It broke off. Also, the buttons on the base have begun to crack.Now I'm back on Amazon coffee-maker shopping."
1,Faberware Perculator,This perculator lasts only a few months. It makes good coffee as long as it lasts. My first one lasted about five months. They sent me a new perculator. The new perculator lasted about eight months. I would not reccomend buying this product.
2,Another DEAD One.... This Makes 3,"Like many others here, I have another dead Farberware coffee pot. First one lasted an astounding 2 whole years before no heat - purchased in '02. Thinking as others have, I assumed a lemon and bought another in May of `'04 - this one didn't even finish the year before not heating the coffee.UpDate Feb. '06 - Make this 3-Dead Ones. The unit is no longer making hot coffe and requires a kick in the pants with the microwave. I have emailed Farberware for a return - Again. We will see where it leads...The only reason I am giving 2-stars is that there was no hassle with the warranty. A pre-paid shipping label was provided and a new pot is on the way. I do believe I will research quality drip machines for my next purchase. They have the same (or better) features as this unit. Probably better - as I have always found it kind'a convoluted the key sequence you enter to set the brew time on the Farberware unit."
1,Waste of Money,"Biggest P.O.S. I've ever wasted money on. Plastic top went after two months-quit completely after about 1 yr. For all of you who bought a second one, thinking that the first one was a lemon, just remember: fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!"
2,"Another ""Tired of Buying These Things""!","I'm with ""Tired of Buying These Things"". Our third pot died on us this morning. It was a relatively slow death, but we knew from the other two what was happening. This is an awesome product if you're willing to invest all this money for a year of good coffee. The timer, cordless and perc are all great things. This pot brews excellent coffee at first. But after a year the coffee isn't so hot and then it stops brewing altogether. Can anyone tell me where I can find a percolator that works? Drip coffee isn't the same. It appears they just don't make them like they used to."
1,Yummy coffee for 9 months...,First the plastic top broke off at 6 months. Then it stopped working at 9.I have one word: Junk.
2,Another Dead Farberware Percolator,"I received this as a gift a little over a year ago. It has made absolutely great coffee. Until 2 days ago. Now it is stone dead. I did notice awhile back that the coffee was not staying very warm. Well, now no coffee. Other reviews are saying the same thing. It seems to have a life of about 1 year.I bought a drip coffee maker at Target to replace this one. The drip coffee maker (Mr. Coffee) lasted for ONE POT and now it is dead. Now I am making instant coffee with the microwave.I like having hot coffee when I wake up at 4 am but I hesitate to buy this product again. The concept is great but the execution is marginal at best"
1,BAD CHOICE !!!!,"I read the reviews before purchasing this pot. I thought the ones that were complaining about the poor quality after a few months had just gotten a bad pot. WELL, IT IS TRUE WHAT IS SAID !!! This pot gave us GREAT coffee for about 6 months. Then it will sometimes not perk the coffee and most of the time it is just lukewarm coffee. NOT the HOT coffee it gave the first 6 months. I had even bought 2 of these pots and my friend's pot went out before mine did. There is something SERIOUSLY WRONG with this pot. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
2,Don't buy,Percolator makes a good cup of coffee but only keeps it luke warm and after 8 months plastic top broke off and Farberware does not have a replacement.
3,FAULTY KNOB,"The knob on top of the lid broke after 7 months of infrequent use. The break rendered the pot useless. I phoned them and they're sending a new one, free. So they should. Otherwise, we've had no problems. If it's the only pot in your house, you better move closer to Starbuck's."
2,Great while it lasts,"Loved it while it worked, which was almost exactly one year. My last drip coffee maker lasted eleven years. Great concept, but needs to be more durable."
2,Great while it lasted...,"Worked great for about a year and a half. Completely went dead. There is obviously a manufacture design flaw ... A real shame, only cordless *programmable* on the market."
1,Use the old Farberware Percolators,"Great concept, but did not keep the coffee as hot as possible and quit after 4 months of use."
2,Loved it til it died,"We loved this product for about 18 months. Yes, ours did last longer than a year. I assume it died for the same reason that so many have stated about the wiring. It definitely made hot flavorful coffee. We went out to buy a replacement but decided to go with a very nice auto drip Cuisinart, and are thrilled with it. Past experience has proven the auto drips to be more reliable. This would be a four to five star product if Farberware dealt with the reliability issue."
1,I returned it!!,"It made cold, bad coffee. I returned it to Amazon because I was immensely dissatisfied."
2,After reading the 68 reviews ...,"I am looking for a perc pot so I appreciate the input from prior buyers. Thank you to the 46 people who wrote to say in one way or another that this pot doesn't stand the time test. We still have a perc pot from 1970 which fixes the best coffee in the world, I just can't take the aluminum leach and must buy a stainless steel."
2,don't buy it,I love percolators and wanted one with a timer. This is not it. The timer is hard to set and read.The display is at an odd angle and does not facilitate easy reading. It is difficult to tell whether the pot is done brewing or not. There is no way to adjust the strength of the brew.
5,Father and sons hobby dreams do come true Gary Joe story,It is a very touching story and also sad and happy feeling ...Love story .....
1,This book is a rip off,"For the price, this book is not even worth half the money. It is intended to teach CS1 (the first computer science course) using Java as the language but it will NOT teach you enough Java. AWT, Applet are cursory covered in a chapter each. Multithreading and networking are mentioned in ONE example for each topic in the Applet chapter.If you have absolutely no programming background, then I guess it will be fine for you. But if you really want to be a Java programmer, spend your hard earned money on Deitel's ""Java How to Program"" book, more bangs for the bucks."
3,"Good, but not complete","This book is only good for those who don't know anything about OOP. If you have already known about C++, or other OOP languages, don't buy this book."
1,This book is hideous,"The only reason why I bought this book was because my teacher chose it for his class.I ended up reading and re-reading the chapters and supplementing it with a more practical book like, ""Teach Yourself Java"", Lemay, et al.There are few examples, and the explanations were hideously twisted and academic. If this book were about breathing, it would explain the finer points of vaccuum differentials while we would all be blue and dead on the floor. Java's not easy, but it's really not THIS hard.The fun started in section 1.7 where it began to slaughter classes and methods, and those letters starting turning into cyrillic and jumping around the page while I sipped caffeine to stay awake to keep my professor happy. And the fun didn't let up from there."
1,A pittiful book,"Holmes has to be one of the worst technical authors I've come accross. The book is intented to address those who do not have much programming experience, but his excessive use of unneeded technical jargon only alienates the reader.I've read passages numerous times to understand what Holmes is trying to say, only to understand less each time. This book will confuse you more than it will help you.Don't waste your time on this waste of paper and words. A much better book for the begninning programer that deals with Java is: Java, An Introduction to Computer Science & Programming, by Walter Savitch."
1,This is a terrible book,There are tons of typos in this book. It's not organized in a logical manner. It emphasizes the simple concepts and glosses over the more difficult ones. The openning chapter is by no means written for a person beginning in JAVA or computer programming for that matter. The progam excercises are extremely vague. Avoid this book if possible!
5,Excellent First Cup of Java,"This is my first review of a book on Amazon, as I am too busy to do this sort of thing. But Mr. Holme's book is so excellent, that I was forced to give up my insularity and write about it. This is the best book for any one, who wishes to start learning Java. Why, the book is so good? Because, Mr. Holmes cuts through the jungle of java information overload and presents you with the facts and programming structures, that you can start reading the book and learning Java in no time. The only other Java book I have found comparably good is ""Teach Yourself Java"" by O'Neill. Excellent work Mr. Holmes. Keep it up."
4,Not induction compatible!!,"I have to return this now because the phrase ""18/10 stainless"" only refers to the handle, not the whole pan. I have a full set of Circulon pans that work with our induction cooktop this one looks just like them. But this one apparently is aluminum (never mentioned in the product description) and it does not have the steel bottom needed for induction cooktops. For any other cooking method, this would be great. Circulon pans are great -- far easier to care for than All-Clad."
5,BEST EVER,"I have been looking for the perfect skillet and I finally found it. There are no hot or cold spots, everything browned evenly. The clean-up was extremely easily--just rinse in hot soapy water, dry and its clean."
4,Interesting and Pleasing,"I must admit that I was completely drawn in to The Sworn Sword, the first story by George R. R. Martin. I could not seem to put the book down, I was mesmerized. As I continued to read on and focus on the next few stories, I found myself missing the first, but, that was soon to fade away upon reading Threshold by Elizabeth Haydon. That work was also beautiful and seemingly flawless. This book in general, every story, runs your mind around these authors vivid imaginations and turn your world upside down for the moment! Great read, highly recommended!"
4,Hot and Cold,"This book was recommended to me by a librarian friend. It is about 50-50 good and not-so-good. The stories that are worth reading are Elizabeth Haydon's, Robin Hobb's, Diana Gabaldon's, Neil Gaiman's, George R. R. Martin's, and Robert Silverberg's. The rest really didn't hold my interest, but I guess if you are a reader of those series you might enjoy them."
2,disappointed in ebook,"I recently purchased the electronic format hoping I could free up some shelf space because I already own the hardback.What a disappointment. I expected links in the Table of Contents but there wasn't even a Table of Contents.I'd return this if I could. If it was print, I would.Two stars only because I liked the print book."
2,This book was a sales trick.,"I have been stuck in the mud with too many serial authors. I feel trapped by books with cliff hangers which require you to read the next book to have any closure. I was finally looking for a book of short fantasy stories when I bought this book and what I got was a book whose only intention was to sell you on even more serial authors. Without checking, I'm almost certain that every short story in this book is a glimpse at a larger serial universe, and only a couple of the stories were any good. For anyone not weighed down by the burder of undending sequential stories, this book will serve its purpose to sell you on a few really good authors."
1,Truth Lush by CK,"I was so disappointed to put it nicely. I was looking for the Truth by Calvin Klein Lush....and the regular one showed up. The picture in the add is the Truth Lush but that is not what I got, I have been looking for it for years and CK decided to not produce it again which is a major let down. Amazon needs to change the picture in the add."
4,Finnish epic,"Apparently the cast recording for a Minneapolis staging of the Finnish epic, Kalevala, this album features gorgeous singing (mostly MacKenzie) in both Finnish and English. It's a lovely song cycle that's equal parts Varttina and Anne Hill. The cover describes it as, 'untamed.' To me it's more a passionate explication of an ancient myth-a myth that celebrates the joys of (re)joining the primitive."
3,Dodge Durango 4.7L - No great improvement,"I replaced the standard Champion plugs with these on my Dodge Durango 4.7L engine. Mileage is the same. Performance is the same. I was secretly hoping these plugs would turn the Durango into a Corvette that got 35 miles per gallon, but no luck. I would buy these plugs again but only if there was a substantial rebate. Not having to adjust the gap is a big plus and they are supposed to last a long time. And I get to brag to my buddies I have these cool iridium, high tech plugs."
3,Bosch Platinum IR Fusion = SMOOTH & POWER but...,"Replaced in to my 2005 HONDA Cr-V. Smooth engine firing and acceleration power immediately noticeable. I monitored the fuel consumption, before and after installation. I found out that fuel efficiency went down, understandably, due to ""increase"" in power. See below:Before installation: 19.99 MPG (average)After installation: 18.54 MPG (average)where MPG = miles per gallon of 87% octane gasoline.Overall..happy with the new performance."
4,Boch plugs,"The spark plugs , lowered engine noise & increased power , also improved power from factory plugs that were in my truck ."

3,"Great voices, but ...","It's the worst kind of hype to compare the Redwalls to the top British Invasion bands. The Beatles, Kinks and Rolling Stones are among the best bands of all time. Instead, compare the Redwalls - at least so far - to third-tier Brit-`60's bands such as the Searchers (`Needles and Pins') or Chad & Jeremy (`Yesterday's Gone'): great vocals, lots of studio effects, weak writing.If the Redwalls improved their writing and held steady on the singing, they could push into the second tier of British Invasion bands occupied by the Zombies and the Animals - two very good bands from 40 years ago. But that would be a strange ambition for young kids from Illinois."
3,Worth about half the buzz,"Enjoyable listen ... more mature than their first release but dangerously close to parody. They almost sound like a tribute band (not a good thing to me.)Could have done without the obscenity-laced rant against the FCC and I wasn't very interested in a view of 'war-and-what-is-it-good-for' from North Shore Chicago kids where there are two Beemers in every garage.Final note: try the Olympic Hopefuls from Twin Cites for fun, original pop music."
3,De Nova - Redwalls,"The Redwalls are a cool British-sounding American band who definitely has good taste in music. The music on De Nova is quite good. It's very Beatles/Rolling Stones-esque. The singer sometimes reminds of Bob Dylan. So it's very retro sounding.In terms of the actual sound of the songs, they sound great. This is good music. However, the songs and the lyrics are not that great and memorable as the musical gods they clearly idolize.Overall, I think these guys are very talented musicians, but the cd left me disappointed. It didn't really move me. I didn't hear any really catchy singles. It was just good/average. I don't think this album is going to age nicely over time like the old 60s albums do."
1,hummm ????,"I think they need to be just a LITTLE more original. I mean sure, the Dandy Warhols sounded like Neil Young for awhile early in their career and Oasis was known for 'borrowing' from the Beatles, but jesus, these *!:&ing kids don't have a lick of originality in their music. They basically use the exact same vocal and instrumental arrangements as their predecessors. (if you even consider these people anything other than a cover band) If they come up with something that sounds even REMOTELY like the redwalls (whoever they are) I'll consider calling it an album. Until then we'll stick with calling it a practice session."
3,Cover art,I haven't heard the album yet ( a friend recommended it) so I gave it 3 stars because Amazon required a rating. But is it me or does the cover have a striking resemblance to the cover of the second album by Traffic ? They even use a similar circular graphic device.
1,what??? what??? what??? is this???,"Ummm... The Redwalls debut is such a piece of garbage. Since when was it cool to sing with a ""fake"" british accent? these dorks are from Deerfield,IL!!! I don't understand the media hype about this band, the Beatles did it much better. Don't be fooled into buying this aweful record. The Redwalls suck big time and should never even have gotten a major label contract. This band is only making music to make money for the people who own them."
4,Redwalls CD,"This is a fantastic album. Think of David Bowie, Queen, Spoon, and Oasis getting together and writing songs. I bought it for the track ""Thank You"", but unlike CD's that you regret buying because they only have one or two good songs, this CD is good wire to wire. This is the kind of album that makes you go buy the rest of the band's catalogue. And I will do just that!"
4,The British Invasion Revisited,"That this power pop band was heavily influenced by such British Invasion bands as The Beatles, The Kinks and the Rolling Stones is obvious after listening to this album. And if their songwriting is a little derivative of those influences, so what? [Badfinger made a career out of mining The Beatles sound!]These thirteen tracks from their major label debut are full of jangly guitars and catchy hooks from the R&B; sound of the opening track ""Robinson Crusoe"" to the full tilt ""Rock & Roll"" that closes the album.This Deerfield, IL quartet may be a throwback to the Sixties, but their sound is a refreshing take on the classic two guitars/bass/drums sound. [Note: They recently finished a tour as opening act for the like-minded band Oasis--specifically requested by Noel Gallagher.] RECOMMENDED"
4,Undeniably Great Songs,"The Redwalls rank up there with somewhat derivative bands like Oasis, Lenny Kravitz, Ben Harper and The Black Crowes. While these artists are clearly influenced by (some would say imitate) The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Sly Stone, etc., they still manage to come up with great, classic songs. The same is true of The Redwalls.They were born to play this kind of music and are very good at it.Check them out live.[DW]"
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!!!,"Finally, rock and roll is back! This day in age there are very few new bands that will play straight up rock and roll. You may have read reviews that have dubbed these guys as ""retro-rock"", but that is not so. They are pure. They are the real deal. If you have not already bought this....DO IT NOW!!!! If you are a fan of rootsy rock in it's purest form, you will love this record!Jason FordKansas City, MO."
4,The Redwalls,"The Redwalls are a mix of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and little of Tom Petty. This bad is up and coming. Truly a great band."
4,"Developing group, decent album","This is a great collection of folksy-blues songs. Yes, they sound like The Kinks, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and pretty much every other British Invasion band from the sixties, but so what? In the early days The Beatles sounded like Roy Orbison and Chuck Berry color-by-numbers. The Redwalls are still in the early stages of their career which seems promising. And songs like ""Falling Down"" and ""Glory of War"" need to be heard by everyone, the former being a song against the censorship fascists of the FCC. With lyrics like ""here come the witch hunt, black listin' FCC/ callin' out the f*cking cavalry,"" the Redwalls show that they have a lot to say and in a few years they will probably be more eloquent in delivery, and may even have their own sound. For now, give them a chance, it's a good listen."
4,"Derivative?... Who cares, if it's good fun","Lest we forget... The Beatles were originally a garage band that covered 60s American soul music, kinda derivative,huh?I think these guys are fun and have a lot of energy and I take their imitation as the highest form of flattery to the canonized Beatles. Just sit back and enjoy them with a grin..."
5,The Redwalls Are Coming!,"In fact, the Redwalls have arrived!This will upset some Beatle people but, they are JUST AS GOOD!I never thought it could happen!"
2,Just a picture catalog.,"Although the book has high quality pictures of some gorgeous guns that will leave you with water dripping from your mouth, it is very insufficient to provide any useful information on the maker or the customizer of any of those guns.Keep in your mind that you are buying a picture book and you won't be disappointed."
3,Serious Economic History,"This is an economic History, so if you want an introduction to this period, this book is NOT the place to start. Read Durant's last two volumes (""Rousseau and Revolution"" and ""The Age of Napoleon"", and/or Gordon A. Craig's ""Europe: 1815-1914"" if you're looking for details on who was in power, what battles were fought, what the main works of art were, etc.But if you are curious about why and how the Industrial Revolution created so much hardship and how the French Revolution changed the European attitude toward revolution in general, this is the book to read. Hobsbawm is a well-known Marxist, but it was the events of this age that spawned Marxism, and it behooves us to understand why that was. For this purpose, you couldn't ask for a better guide.Unfortunately, Hobsbawm is a moderately difficult read. Take it a little bit at a time."
3,The dual revolution,"Hobsbawn wrote this book for those who wish to understand how and why the world has come to be what it is and where it is going. This is not a narrative history, and requires thought. The book is complex, but considering the topic and the length of the book, he has to be. But if your are an educated reader...you will like this book; and learn a lot from it about ""isms"" and how we use to live. Though I only gave it 3 stars, it is a must read."
3,SLOW!,The book is so slow!. It is jammed packed with information but I swear he used a thesaurus to pick half of the words. Lot's of good info but a horrible read.
3,Uneven,"Readers don't criticize Marxist historians because of unexamined prejudice, rather it is because of Marxists' generally lopsided treatment of history. Marxists are second to none when covering economic subjects (unless, of course, you happen to disagree with the Marxist theory of capital), and these are important for an understanding of history. But, contrary to what the Marxists would have you believe, they are not the only things. A second objection is that Marxist histories are most often based upon an obsolescent view of human nature."
2,Marxist history at its finest,Hobsbawm takes a look at the age of revolution in Europe during the time frame of 1789-1848 and botches just about everything. He is so focused on Marxism that he misses almost all of the other aspects of these revolutions. You are so distracted by his Marxist overtones that you end up missing what he is talking about in most of the book. It is poorly written and if I had not had to read the book I would have stopped after the first twenty pages. Find anything else.
5,Add it to the other tools.,"I bought this micrometer item as well as the 308 version. As I said for the 308, this device helps in getting to the precision reloading level. A definite plus (as always with RCBS products) and well worth the money."
2,"It should work great, but...","The headspace tool should work great. However, the documentation was not clear to me. I got way different readings on 5 different recently fired casings from the same lot of factory ammo. I ended up using a Hornady Lock 'n Load headspace gauge. The freebore tool was a waste of time. Not only was the documentation not clear, but the tool itself was difficult to use. I couldn't tighten the nylon sleeve tight enough by hand, so I had to use a pair of pliers. I got two different readings. When I gently pushed the bolt carrier on my AR-15 until it was home & the bolt locked, I got one reading. When I pushed the freebore tool into the chamber by hand, I got a different reading - shorter! I finally decided to try letting the bolt carrier slam forward normally. When I pulled back on the charging handle, the cartridge wouldn't eject. I had to use a cleaning rod to eject the tool.Perhaps this will work with a single shot bolt action rifle."
3,It's Okay.,"This is my least favourite treble charger album. First time I listened I didn't like but they soon grew on me so it'll probably be the same with others. But still its the least attractive for a top-40 fan; nc-17 appeals more. Don't judge just by these songs if you don't like.Morale, Even Grable, Case In Fact, and Slight aren't that catchy songs. Cleric's Hip is okay too. They may be good to indie fans but not TC's fans who also like mainstream music. Sick Friend Called and Motor Control are more enjoyable. Disclaimer isn't of much effort like the rest but its relaxing and depressing you can listen to lots once it grows on you. And Half Down is sluggish, the vocals aren't good, mellow but not depressing like Disclaimer."
1,Im looking for a song they sang was friend of mine,i AM LOOKING FOR THE NAME OF THE CD THAT THE TREBLE CHARGERS SANG THE SONG FRIEND OF MINE
4,Good,"I use this book for designing composite aircraft structures and it does help me, although i wish they had more programs for running optimal layups of composite surfaces, but all in all a worth book for student and professional engineers alike."
2,Less than Very Good,"I bought this book to help me with my Master of Engineering study in aerospace engineering.On each and every subject, the book jumps quickly into mathematical methods and derivation without sufficient physical or engineering description.It may be considered as a good reference for the formulae and equations for composites, but never a good book that explains or teaches the engineering or physical aspects of the mechanics of composites.It is a classical problem with engineering professors and authors who are more in the ""calculus world"" than the key engineering concepts."
2,The sleepiest monument,"The book I read was called The Monument by Gary Paulsen. TRhe problemof the story is that the boy in the story named Mick has to build a monument for a city in Kansas,but everyonein the town has to like it. The main characters are Mick, Rachel, and Micks dog Rocky. The rising action is whern mick is getting to the deadline and he has to hurry up. the climax of the story is when problems arise and by the time they clear up the deadline is already there. They make it but they almost dont. The resolution is when all the people see the art and admire it. This connects to me because last year we had to draw pictures and the whole school had to like them. We made it in time and we got to have the joy that mick got in the book."
1,Terrible,This book has little plot and is lacking substance. It is abouta pathetic young girl who's only friend is a dog. And if you think that'slame she meets a man by seeing him with his pants down so from then on in they become friends. Mick the artist with his pants down influences the main character to be an artist and the lameness begins!!!!!!!!!
4,The Monument,Gary Paulsen's The Monument is a very eccentric story of a young African American girl with a leg brace in an orphanage. Rocky (the young girl) feels as if no one will ever adopt her and one day a couple walked in and said that they wanted to adopt her and she fills with a magical feeling inside herself. Rocky lives the life she never thought she would have.In this magnificent book you go on with her through everything that is as new to her as it is to you. By Mackenzie
4,A book to remember,"Although it is a simple story, it is probably my favorite Gary Paulsen book so far. It talks a lot about art, but the real point of the book is a minority, handicapped girl who learns how to see life in a new way and discovers that she has a talent of her own. Along with that is a town that comes together to make one decision that will help it heal and then grow together. This book is short and easy to read, but makes a lasting impression."
2,The Monument By:Gary Paulsen,"This book is about a girl named Rachel Ellen Turner who was adopted by two alcoholic parents. They are loving though. They adopted her despite of her leg being stiff and her skin color being darker than their's. Rachel had no freinds at first, but then she met Python, a dog. They were inseparable.One day the town that she is living in, Bolton, Kansas, desides to have amonument put in the town in honor of the people who died in war from Bolton. The town hires a man named Mick to build the monument. Rachel and Python met Mick and they all became best friends. They would walk around and Mick would draw everything he saw. He ended up teaching Rachel some artistic pointers.I did not really care for this realistic fiction book. I thought it was boring. I think it could have been more interesting. I think elderly people would enjoy this book. I didn't like it because it wasn't action packed. It also didn't have anything to do with athletics. It just wasn't my type of book."
4,Good book to teach?,"I am a junior in college, working for a degree in elementary and middle school education. I read this book for my ""Teaching Young Adult Literature"" class. The Monument is a great book for teachers to utilize in their classroom--especially if they would like to do a unit on books where the protagonist has a disability. Gary Paulsen does an excellent job of developing his charactrs, thus, creating empathy in his readers. I appreciate the advanced ideas he is able to portray to younger readers."
2,The Monument,"The Monument takes place in Bolton, Kansas,where a young girl named Rocky struggles to fit in her new town. She was adopted by Emma and Fred in a great house where her life begins to come together.One afternoon, Rocky was walking around with her new dog, Python, where she meets Mick. Mick is a very artistic kid who was chosen to construct the town monument. Rocky and Mick become great friends, and they learn to respect each other.I thought this book could've been better written. It had a couple pages where it got my attention, but sometimes became dull. I would reccomend this book to ages 10 and up."
1,Info Filled,"First page out, reminded us to get an aquarium not a wire cage to keep the babies from escaping!"
5,More informative rather than training.,"Other than my feeling that the title is a little misleading, I still would recommend this book to anyone thinking of owning pet rats. Don't get me wrong, it does contain information about training your rats but I think it contained more info about keeping them safe and happy, which I suppose would make for an easier to train pet rat. I have had pet rats for a while but I still like to learn from others about them and I did pick up a few things from this book I didn't know before. This book has excellent photos and I read it with (to) my two year old granddaughter so she could understand the importance of taking care of our little friends. The photos kept her entertained and made her want to learn even more about what the rats are doing. I am not disappointed at all in this purchase and still think it is a good read for all current and potential pet rat owners."
5,straightforward & covers the high points!,"I love it... haven't finished it yet but expect to soon. The half+ that I've already covered includes all the fine points of how to prepare for your new pet(s) and how to select them - GOOD advice! Now I'm at the fun part and am looking forward to implement the easy and straightforward ideas on training. In addition - it's a light read, sprinkled w/ humor... makes it even more enjoyable."
1,This miss-titled book gives scant training information,"I have owned pet rats for quite a long time, but never considered training them. When I got my newest rat, I ordered this book on-line with high hopes. After reading the book cover to cover I was bitterly disappointed to see that it had little information on how to train your rat to do anything interesting. This book covers every possible thing one could want to know about caring for pet rats, and for that it is a good book. But to be titled: Training Your Pet Rat, and then almost no info on training, well, I can not recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to train you pet rat."
1,Damaged product,"I ordered Oneida Mooncrest service for 8 flatware as a gift for Christmas. The item arrived after the guaranteed next day deliver and was late for Christmas. The product arrived in an undamaged box. When the product was taken out of the box, over 50% of the utensils were scratched or nicked on the handles. Very disappointing and embarassing."
4,Oneida silverware are the best!,I received the silverware in a quick manner and I love the product. I love Oneida and the price was perfect!
5,"Wow, Great bang for your buck!","I don't have any of the rusting problems that some of the other people have mentioned here. I put them in my dishwasher and they do just fine. They are a nice thick metal so they don't bend easily. Great value, HIGHLY recommended"
1,Oneida Flatware,"My wife and I purchased a new set of Oneida Flatware (Bristol pattern)because we were just tired of the 25 year old set we had. What a mistake. Within months we had rust spots showing up so I returned the spotted pieces. I ended up doing this several times. The entire set after just a couple of years looks worse than our old set (wish we had kept it). I learned from the customer rep at Oneida (very helpful and sympathetic) that the set which I have was made in Viet Nam. Sadly I think Oneida is marketing their products on their old reputation. Save your money. Try another brand or just buy something cheap, it can't be as bad as Oneida."
4,"Nice, but need polishing after washing","Very nice. Unfortunately, they have water spots on them after you take them out of the dishwasher. They get fingerprints very easily as well."
4,Very nice silverware,"They are very nice and clean really easy. Even stuck on nasty food. They are very comfortable to hold (yes its possible to have ""comfortable"" silverware). I only wish you got more small forks and spoon. I hate using big ones =)I would definitely recommend them. Great product and worth the $$"
1,Frustrating and disappointing,I was so excited to bring these home but after the first wash in the dishwasher there was rust! Amazing!!!! And it just grows and grows. At first it was the knives now more and more pieces are rusting. Buyer beware.
1,RUSTING WITHIN JUST ONE MONTH,Bought in September 2011. Rusting by October 2011. Oneida needs to get its act together and bring production back to the U.S. They are ruining their formerly good reputation. I won't be buying (or trusting in) the Oneida name anymore after this. It's totally unacceptable and so hard on the planet to be making junk only to fill landfills.
1,Do not buy this item,"Hi all,I have purchased this item 6 months ago and I have just start using it.I have used it just couple of times (less than 10 times) and its color or finishing start fading!!!"
4,Love the weight/qualit,"I like this item, but have mixed feelings on some of its features. I love the weight/quality and the fact that the design continues on the underside of the flatware. The pieces are longer than my old set and the salad forks are nearly as large as my old dinner forks."
5,Nice Quality Very Happy,These utentsils have a nice weight to them. They are not skinny or cheap. Good Price. Nice Design. Very Satisfied
5,shiny,"These are great. Shiny and heavy, this silverware set is perfect for entertaining and dinner parties. The set even comes with serving spoons and a sugar spoon I believe."
1,Honest warning.,"I am baffled and frustrated by all of the good reviews this flatware has received. Baffled because I received this set in early April and less than two months later the majority of the pieces have rust spots - which only continue to appear. Frustrated because I put stock in the positive comments, which ultimately led me to make the purchase. The flatware does look nice and it is sturdy and solid, but it rusts, which far outweighs any positive aspect. There is a reason the set is so cheap...it is cheap."
1,Inferior Quality,Not sure why this product go so many good reviews. I took one fork out of the box and decided to send the set back. The fork tines were not finished well on the inside edges and the end was blunt and rough.
2,Defective set,"I have a set of Oneida Mooncrest for four, and I ordered this set to have more place settings. My original set was made in Indonesia in May 2010, and it is wonderful. It has a nice heavy hand. It is elegant enough to be used for a fancy dinner, yet plain enough to be used for every day. The set I ordered from Amazon.com was made in China in February 2009. Some pieces have pocks in the metal. Some pieces of the same type - ie. salad forks, dinner spoons - are different sizes, thicknesses, and shapes. I didn't even unpack all the pieces because I was so disappointed. I think it is because of poor quality control in the manufacturing location. (The location and date of manufacture is stamped on the back of the pieces.) The packaging says the pieces were manufactured in China, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and/or USA. I think I will be returning the set I got through Amazon.com."
3,love these!,"These are very nice. My husband and I put these on our wedding registry at amazon.com (by the way using amazon.com as a wedding registry was AWESOME). We have zero complaints. We put them in the dishwasher and they come out very clean. They've kept their color and shine. They don't have any scratches or blemishes. I love the way they look and they feel perfect in your hand.----After one year of use:We are still happy with this product but we have noticed some rust and discoloration that we are not used to with flatware. It might be because it's 18/0 and not 18/10. We are disappointed and are now looking for higher quality flatware. We have never had an issue with 18/10 so we're going back to that. For the price that this set costs, we were shocked that it wasn't 18/10 to begin with. Our original rating was 5 stars, now we'll go with 3... still like the style just unhappy with the way they wore."
2,Left side stopped working - unacceptable at this price,"Like some of the other reviewers, I am very disappointed in this product. After 1.5 years of very mild use, the left side stopped working. For a toaster of this price, I should be able to give it to my children when they leave for college. Ironically, their expensive espresso machine was buggy as well, so I'm really skeptical of the KitchenAid pro-line products now. Will look elsewhere, and recommend you do too."
1,Faulty Toaster,I bought a 4-slice Artisan toaster and half the slots failed just out of warranty and the plastic handles also shattered within six months of purchase. I wouldn't risk my money on buying this toaster. The repairs are really expensive too! Maybe they fixed the bugs in the factory?
4,"It is not a true Wing Chun, but it is useful","THis DVD is fun to watch and it is good ""fighting skill"", BUT, it does not apply the true theory of Wing Chun such as economy of energy and the Wing Chun Ma in fighting. But, in my opinion, as long as you can protect yourself in a dangerous situation, that's what matter, regardless of whether you are using true Wing Chun and not true Wing Chun."
1,This is NOT Wing Chun,"The ""Little Idea"" was pulled apart, picked over, and repackaged into nothing even close to Wing Chun. The principles are shot to hell here. For example, you don't wail away and overpower your opponent with brute force, you feel your way over the bridge and strike efficiently. His movements are wasteful in the extreme, his stance and center of balance constantly leaving him wide open to a real wingchunner's strike. Whatever this guy is demonstrating, it is far closer to MMA than Wing Chun. Save your money."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I didn't find this video helpful in any way. In fact, the video was more funny than useful. I can't decide what was the most comical, between the stream of conscious dialog, the interview with a ""law enforcement"" official, or the scenes of the ""master"" filmed with a camcorder on the front lawn. As I watched this DVD, I could not help feel that I was being punked."
5,"Durable, Very useful table","We purchased this table for our 2 year old son to use for his Matchbox and Hot Wheels Car sets. The assemby is very easy and the table is very strong. My son ends up on top of it quite often and there have been no problems with it toppling over. We have not tried to put his trains on it yet, but it would definitely work for that too. The little storage containers are nice and when you have the table in the highest position, there is room underneath the table for additional storage boxes."
4,It's sturdy and keeps him busy!!!!!!!,My kid plays on this thing none stop. That includes sitting and laying on it in the process. I have even seen him stand on it which I would not recommend. He has had it awhile now and is still using it so as far as I'm concerned it was a good purchase. Great for his trains and cars.
5,"Nice table, a little small for train set","My son received this table for Christmas to put his GeoTracks train set on. Unfortunately, the table is not nearly large enough to put the entire set of tracks on. I was afraid this would happen, but bought it anyway. We may decide to put the train set back on the floor and use the table for other things. It was super easy to put together and I love the storage bins on the ends. Even though it's not well-suited for the purpose we intended, we still love the table and can make use of it in some way."
1,CAME BROKEN,"We ordered this table for my 2 year old son's Chirstmas gift, since he was receiving a Thomas train set. Hight adjustment and side drawers looked perfect. However the top part of the table was already broken in the box. It looks very thin and fragile, so we returned it and bought a different train table. I doubt how long it would last even if we got an unbroken one."
5,mazz music,This cd is great. I recieved it in only a few days and I am really hjappy with both service and product!
5,Locating and Correcting Reading Difficulty,The book was filled with ideas and resources to use to correct and identify reading problems. It is a very good resource book to have on hand.
4,"good, could of been wrapped","thought it would of been in a wrapper because it was new, but other than that it was a good purchase. A"
5,Pedigree can food,Great buy and low shipping cost for something this heavy. Make sure when you order this you look for the 20 cents a pound shipping.
5,Menopause Guidebook is your best resource for accurate information,"The Menopause Guidebook is your best resource for accurate information about staying healthy during midlife. This book is published by the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), North America's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the health and quality of life of women transitioning through and beyond menopause. This new edition is highly accurate and up-to-date. It will answer all of your questions about menopause, from hot flashes and sexuality to osteoporosis and life beyond cancer. As a contributor to this guide book, I may be biased, but it is truly an excellent resource for helping you stay healthy and informed during this important stage of life."
3,sony 600 watt amp,i just purchased this amp and did not realize it does not have a subwoofer channel. I hope i can use it.
4,great thrash still around in 03',"Brutality has been redifined. The energy on this record is incredible, brutal, fast, and at times melodic. Everything you could ask for in a thrash album. What stands out the most to me is the amazingly technical drumming, awsome stuff \m/"
5,Anna Nicole is the best!,"This DVD is the best for anybody that loves reality TV and excepts and understands different kinds of lifestyles. Her partying is a blast to watch and her fights with Howard are the very funny! Buy this DVD, it is worth it!"
5,I Miss Anna Nicole,"I really enjoyed her TV Series alot and I will miss her Truly. I have most of her movies.But Heres The One Problem ""When are they ever going to release the last 2 seasons on DVD I would like to see those Uncensored as well."
5,HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"Yes, this show is hilarious! Each episode has a few good one liners. and you cant but help and laugh at all the people. Kim, (wish i had a job like hers, an assistant who does nothing but follow anna around), and her lawyer howard who is constantly kissing her ass. some of my favorite episodes are the xmas party (how can anyone forget shelley) and where they go to magic mountain. and isn""t that dog psychic amelia kinkade the one who played in all three Night of the Demons movies? Howard is just bad as Bobby about egging each other on. anna ,youre so outrageous! and so is this dvd!"
2,The horror!!!,I can't stand to look too close when Anna's cousin is on the show...you have to see her to believe it! It scares me to think people like this roam the earth...This episode wasn't that funny more annoying because you just want to run screaming after seeing this *thing* on the screen. I won't spoil the episode but cousin Shelly is the biggest hick thing to hit TV....scary!
1,damaged,"i ordered the anna nicole smith show season 1, & it arrived here damaged. the first dics is cracked, unplayable, damaged case too"
2,Howard K Stern so annoying in this episode.,"In this episode Anna Nicole sells off some of her artwork...which by the way reminds me of something a 3 year old would paint. It's pretty sad. . . Howard K Stern acted like a complete retard in this episode but what's new, he kinda ruined it so this isn't one of the funnier episodes."
4,Poor Anna,Poor Anna..heck Id buy a season 2 if it comes out. She hasnt had an easy life and it shows. So what if shes a gold digger..how many of us would do the SAME thing if put in her shoes? Good show
3,A window into a life that is probably quite different from your own.,"This reality show gives us a look at a C-list celebrity whose time in the spotlight has come and gone. As she struggles to hold on to the estate left to her by her deceased husband, Anna lethargically goes through the humdrum activities of daily life... often with extreme difficulty. Howard, Bobby Trendy, pathetic relatives, and others prove that if you've got a little money or a little fame, you'll never die alone if you don't want to. In a way the show is a bit depressing, as the viewer debates who the biggest loser is: Anna or her hangers-on. The bottom line, though, is that it's funny. It's kind of hard to explain.... it's not that there are really any jokes, but whenever I see this show I can't help but laugh. A lot. Buy it used for $9; there are worse ways to squander that much."
4,Cowboy up!,"Cowboy Ethics is like getting two books in one. The first is a kaleidoscopic tour of cowboy life. Owen's description of cowboy ethics is the purported purpose of the book, but renowned Western photographer David R. Stoecklein's pictures grab the reader's attention.The full title is Cowboy Ethics, What Wall Street Can Learn from the Code of the West. In my opinion, the whole of American society, not just the tip of Manhattan Island, should rediscover the Code of the West. Owen points out that this code has never actually been written down, so he took several years to put together his own list. I think he does a good job of summing up the Code of the West.If you're a cowboy, you already know the code, but it never hurts to be reminded. The brilliance of this book is that the remarkable photographs will pull you into the code over and over again. Isn't that how ethics have been passed down from generation to generation for eons--by repetition."
5,The Photography is incredible,"I received this book as a gift and now I have to pass it on. The photography is outstanding and if we could just all live by ""The Code of the West!"""
3,Why is hardcover $600?,"Is my browswer not working correctly? What is an ordinary book like this, albeit a nice one, $600? Once I obtain a copy I promise to revise the review to reflect the book."
2,Got to do more than watch a movie to be a cowboy,"I found the book to be elementary and shed little light on the heart of a cowboy. It appeared that most of the information was gleened from hollywood movies which the author seems to reflect upon throughout the pages. I believe a real cowboy might consider this book a ""dandy."" The photos and layout were great, thus two stars"
5,Ethic's my Father taught me,This is a great book to remind you the ethics your father taught you many years ago. It is a great reminder and a help to refocus what is important and an important way to live ones life. Everyone should read and give to their closest friends and family.
5,Cowboy Ethics,Excellent books with good thoughts. Could be a perfect addition to a coffee table with the beautiful pictures
5,Excellent service,"Quick response to my order, shipped promptly, plus a ""signed"" copy as a bonus. Great job!"
5,A new bread of alternative hip hop.,"These guys created the perfect combination of dub, rock, and hip-hop. I've been searching for a band like this for a long time and finally I found them. Most bands that try to fuse hip hop with other genres just sound like they're trying a little too hard, but El Jefe puts out their own brand of it. I love it!"
2,Good Controller At First...,"When I first started using this controller, I thought it was good. But now that I have a Nintendo 64 and a Dreamcast, (their controllers are both great,) I look back at Playstation's controllers, and the analog is weird and doesn't work well, and the controller is small and plain (nothing special,)and harder to hold than Nintendo's or Dreamcast's"
3,Good Controller,I bought this controller used and it works just fine. It may be important to note that this is an A-Series PSX controller. That wasn't apparent in the main product description.
5,Great for gamers!!,"The controller is much better than the others, for a good gamer! It has two buttons that let you steer like you are driving a car. You can also use the arrow buttons. ( Just so you know, it has all the buttons the regular controller has. ) Every time you hit something while playing a game, the controller vibrates! ( It vibrates for all games except the old games for PlayStation. ) It really gives you the feel of the game!My sister thinks differently. She is 10 and hates this controller because of the vibration. Every time she dies, it vibrates. This sometimes happens alot and can be bother some. (Sometimes it vibrates every minute.) Less skilled gamers should stick with the original controller!"
5,STILL THE BEST,"I'm quite familiar with this controller. I remember when it first came out, i remember ape escape being one of if not the first to REQUIRE analong sticks. I have one of these to this day plugged into my ps3 through the usb - ps2 adapter, and i intend to buy 2 or 3 more. This controller i s sooo much better than a ps3 SIXAXIS controller. This will take a good angry "" twist"" and not even flex while an off brand like yobo or nyko will crumble in my hands as all the buttons fell out and circut bourds crumble to pieces like nothing (this is the case with the ps3 SIXAXIS as well), very weak plastic. the sony psx/ps2 wont twist, the plastic is very sturdy and can take some intense beatings. As upposed to a dualshock 2 controller the analog sticks are SO SOFT, this is the reason i've kept it around and used it primarily for so long. It was there for me for resident evil, it was there for ps2 raimbow six lockdown, and its right here on Call Of Duty 4. and i wouldnt have it any other way"
1,Garbage,"What I got is nothing like what is pictured. All i was looking for, was an original PS1 Dual Shock controller. The simple gray one from when Playstations were first released. What I got was some poorly developed/designed third-party controller. Not the least bit ergonomic in anyway and to top it all off, it is completely useless in that the controller does not even fit in the port. It's too big for it so don't let the price fool you, they get you with $9.99 for shipping. So even for 1, I am sorely disappointed."
4,Great to use in actiongames,"I have had my playstation in almost a year now and I had the Dual shock controller ever since I got my consol.I use it for all my games but I think it is funniest to use in NHL 2000 from EA-sports. It is great that you can feel that you are getting hit in the fights and that the controller is really shaking when you have lost a fight. Furthermore the feeling when you get a tackle on to the boards is quite funny.I have used the controller for other games as well. And even though some the games are not able to use the shock-function the controller is very good anyway.The buttons are easy to reach, the analog control is well functioning and the controller is nice to hold in your hands even when you have played for a long time.All in all a good controller that can be used in all sorts of games - but of course it is best in games which are enabled to use the shockfunction"
1,it ...,this item is to big and to heavy.the rumble is to strong andmesses you up.get the joystick add-on insted.
5,nice old school,i remember for some ps2 games i used the ps1 controller for it. the controller for the ps2 and ps3 did not chande much. these are great i love them.
5,Fast Delivery,Fast delivery and product was exactly as decribed. I am excited to have such a book to help teach our baby both English and Turkish with such a book.
1,Horrible acting,"Not only was the acting horrible, but the process from being a normal teenage girl to a weight obsessed gymnast was not believable at all. Basically, the middle part was fine. The beginning and ending to this movie did not flow. I was not convinced she had an eating disorder."
4,For what it was....,This movie was perfect for young female gymnists to watch. It focuses on the pressures and stress of being in a competitive sport. I think the actress did very well in portraying a young girl with anorexia. This is a must see for everyone. Well done.
5,Excellent,"I ordered this movie after finding out it had Amy Jo Johnson in it. I've loved her acting ever since I saw her in Power Rangers and Susie Q so I figured I'd really like this movie as well. I was definitely right on.The movie was very powerful and shocking. I loved the music picked for it because it just made it even more haunting. Andie's downward spiral is evident, from the weight loss to the sudden mood swings. It was very powerful.This movie is definitely one of my new favorites; I've already watched it twice and I've a feeling I'll be watching it again soon."
3,It Was Okay,"I had bought this movie along with the DVD ""Dying to be thin"" which I found to be much more enjoyable to watch.Perfect Body is about a girl athlete who was forced into the world of eating disorders. I found it disappointing that even though many people were saying how she was ""too thin"". The only thing different about her was the makeup on her face to make her appear gaunt and malnourished.Overall the movie was okay but I could only watch it once."
2,Good Movie; Outrageous Price,"I saw this movie when I was really young - around middle school aged. At the time, I was also involved in gymnastics, but, since I also hit puberty around that age I was a little heavier than most of the other gymnasts. Seeing this movie helped me come to terms with not all girls looking the same and realizing that it doesn't really matter if you're a little chubby in sports, your health is what really matters. All in all, it's a good movie; I'd give it 4 stars. But seriously, $85 new -$65 used?! It's a tv movie that I think I saw on Lifetime or something! Not worth the price - try to find it on YouTube or something else (the crazy price is why I deducted 2 stars)."
1,SNOOZE,"I hate this alarm clock. I would like to know what is wrong with it, the snooze button only works when it wants to. I got one as a wedding present and the snooze only worked when it wanted so i took it back and got a new one and the new one does the same thing. I have tried useing only Alarm 1 or only Alarm 2 and using both, also tried hitting the snooze button in different places and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. This morning my husband used Alarm 2 and got up at 4:30 and i hit the snooze to test it and it worked, (hasn't worked in about 5 days) and my alarm 1 went off at 7am and I hat the snooze and it didn't work so I didn't wake up till 8:00, Hello suppose to be at work already! It is very fustrating, and I can't figure out when it likes to work and when it doesn't. So I would like to chuck it across the room. I will be buying another alarm clock and throwing this one away! My husbands $.25 clock that he got at a rummage sale works better!! If you see this alarm clock run!"
1,WENT CRAZY ON ME!,"I realize that sometimes you just get a bad product and it does not reflect the quality of the product. But I still thought I should let people know that not only did my alarms randomly come on 7 hours early, but my clock once read ""18:88"". Enough said.I took the item back for a ""better"" Emerson, and that too was horrid."
2,Not a good alarm clock,"I bought this product about 3 weeks ago because I liked the display. In the first week I accidently set the clock forward 45 minutes because the clock set button is right next to the alarm set buttons (I had to wedge paper in it so I can't hit it accidently) and then I forgot to set the alarm twice. You have to turn the alarm on seperately from setting the time, my old alarm clock turned on the alarm whenever I set the time. After oversleeping the second time because I forgot to set the alarm on I'm buying another alarm clock!"
3,Be careful,"I bought this alarm because of the price and the fact it is a dual alarm. However, the dual alarm feature does not really work!!! Many times, we have been late, because I will turn off one alarm, thinking the second one will do it's job, and it does not!!!I like the big display and that is the only reason we have kept it for over a year. I'm probably going to invest in a Sony which my husband told me to get in the first place. I'll give this one to my 8 year old who only needs one alarm."
1,This is the WORST alarm clock everrrr!,"I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE I bought this stupid thing. After reading what others had to say I am so glad to see that it wasn't just me... IF YOU TURN OFF THE FIRST ALARM THE SECOND ONE WILL NOT GO OFF LATER!!!! At first I thought maybe I messed it up and turned if off, then I tried to convince myself that I was so sleepy I kept turning it off, then I realized, NO this stupid alarm clock just doesn't work after turning off the first alarm! I know it makes NO sense but it's true. I hate this thing! I am going to get a new one right now! Believe me yes, this thing is cheap but you really do get what you pay for! I would rather have a Rooster than this clock!"
5,its great,"Everything has gone great with this clock. It's perfect and it wasn't that expensive! I've read some other reviews about how they can't get it to work.... well did you read the directions? Sometimes it helps.So far I haven't missed a day of school or been late for anything. I've got my alarm clock to work and my radio. If your on a budget and need a great clock, I recomend this one. I don't believe any of the other reviews because this is a great clock."
4,Not a Feel Good Hit,"Warning, you have to be just a bit morbid to pick up this book. The dust jacket says it all, this author has dug through the autopsy reports of some famous people to find the ""real"" cause of death. Keeping the tabloid effort of the publisher aside, this is a somewhat interesting book if only from a ""looking at an accident"" form of macabre curiosity. As far as the writing goes, the author does a good job of keeping the complex medical terminology down to a minimum and when used is careful to explain them in layman's terms. Overall interesting and well-written if you are in to this type of book."
1,Junky product; Not worth the money you spend on it,"This thing just plain doesn't work. I'd like to see the results of those people who claim it made milk successfully; I bet the stuff that came out doesn't even closely resemble soy milk.1) I soaked the beans as instructed and started the machine. It incessantly beeped at me with its ""something is wrong"" message. I kept fiddling with it and started it over until it finally completed one cycle. That was the first problem.2) There is no heating element! Your soy milk is heated by something exactly like the hot plate that keeps your coffee warm in your coffee maker. It just isn't capable of heating the soy milk to proper temperatures.3) Don't be fooled by the stainless steel appearance in the picture. Don't expect high-quality. It is a flimsy thin steel that I'm sure would dent if you were a little too rough with it.This is a horrible product that was surely ill-conceived from the start."
1,I don't recommend this brand....,"I got the Nutritionist Soymilk maker for a present and was delighted at the idea. However, after three batches the plastic strainer had ripped in numerous places. I don't like the idea of a plastic strainer as it is because plastic gives off estrogen like chemicals when heated. A stainless steel basket would have been more approprete. The manual states the milk will boil for 10 minutes. But the finished product is not hot enough to have boiled for even one minute. I am going to return my appliance and look for a better brand."
2,Nutritionist SY5 Soy Milk Maker,"The Nutritionist SY5 Soy milk maker, works fine, except; I don't like the plastic basket inside the maker. There is a soy milk maker, with stainless still basket & the mash. It makes okara (left over from the milk)very fine like a paste.I use that in every meal that I prepare.Most of all,try couple spoons in the pancake batter--delicious !! You can order on web www.sanlinx@soymilkmaker or call1-888-228-3082. Price $125.00 mention ""code 101"" to get $5.00 off. Shipment $12.00 Good luck."
3,"nutritionist soymilk works, but could be improved","For [PRICE] at a local store, it seemed to be worth a try. After useing for 2 months, I have come to find out that it is not as sturdy as I would like. The basket is attached to the grinder and is difficult to clean, with only the lid coming off. My finger barely squeezes between the blade to clean the inside out. The process takes about 20 minutes and produces pretty good milk, but I feel it needs sweetening before drinking. The machine is very hot and takes quite awhile to cool before being able to make a second batch. One cup of dry beans, soaked for 6 hours, will make one gallon, but only one quart at a time. There is a bit of beany flavor.My next soymilk maker will be the SoyaJoy"
1,Plasticy,"Plastic bean basket is a bad idea. Stainless steel is much more durable. As for the beany taste, that's partly a fault of the unit. The milk needs to be heated to a specific temp to break down the beany taste. Good soy milk still has a light bean flavor, but a little vanilla, or cocoa, and stevia (natural, non-caloric sweetner) will easily cover it up. Fresh soy milk also has no additives you don't put in it as well as enzymes and other helpful compounds not found in commercial brands. Have had a Soya Joy for 4 years without a hitch. Just a better design."
4,"Fill it, shut it, forget it!",An easy way to make inexpensive soymilk with minimal trouble. The instructions were easy to follow. I am lactose intolerant and was purchasing soymilk at the rate of $2.50 per week. Now the same $2.50 (for the beans) can be stretched to a few months! Definite value for money!
1,bad product,"I had this for less than a year. I tried making soy milk maybe 5 times. first two times, it worked!then it has problems. every time I plugged in, and did exactly as required in the instruction book. Actually I don;t even need to look at the instruction. When I lived in Beijing, I had one and made soymilk almost every week.Ok, anyways, I won;t have any problems using this thing properly.but it did not work for the last three times I tried . right after I started it, it would give beeping sounds after a short period of grinding.I will send this to services and see what happens. so far, I think it deserves a one star. hopefully customer services will change my mind."
2,Machine Malfunctioning,"I have this soy milk maker that often malfunctions for no reason. It starts off fine and then the grinding suddenly stops after a few minutes and the machine signals the end by beeping. I contacted Salton and they sent me a new one, but it has the same problem. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?"
3,Bubbling over advise,"For those of you who have written about it boiling over - here is what you need to do. It bubbles over when it is too thin, so use more beans -NOT LESS - and soak them 8-10 hours -NOT LESS. I think you will find a better taste and a nice full batch! Good luck"
1,nutritionist SY5A Soy Milk Maker,"I really feel headche with this nutritionist SY5A Soy Milk Maker. It says very simple to use it, but it is not. Maybe mine doesn't work at all, why it start to beep after just several minutes. I contacted the company, NO ANSWER! I am going to buy another brand soymilk maker which the services are good."
1,drove me crazy,"I have had this unit for 2 years, but used it only 2 times. operating this unit is pain in the neck. I followed the instruction when making the milk, but it alway had the ""beep"" sound in the middle of the process and stop operating, i would not want another unit of this. worst household machine ever..."
4,Confessions of Saint Augustine,"It needs 5 stars, but your accompanying comment to 5 stars is not appropriate. Wonderful it is nevertheless. A good book."
4,good translation,Some of the translations of older catholicwritings are very old english style and notthat easy for modern readers to cope with.This is not the case for this translation.Good read.
5,The Confessions of St. Augustine,This book lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest books on spirituality ever written. Probably the most amazing thing about it is how very modern it is. The confessions of St. Augustine's life could easily be applied to the setting of academia in 21st century Virginia. This is a must for anybody interested in the theology of mercy in the Christian faith.
5,Biography and philosophy,"I was asked to read this book as a freshmen in college and I loved it. It is not an easy read, but once you read over a part once more, Augustine's logic makes perfect sense. If you've read any other Augustine, such as ""Freedom of the will"", this book fits right in there and explains it perfectly. In fact, this book explains most of Augustine's tenants perfectly. If anyone wants to know why Christianity took such a harsh stand against sexual sins...it's Augustine lashing out at his past. He was really tormented. Worship God or worship sex. He chose God and I'm sure he thought about going back. Augustine also developed the full Christian idea of free will, which is manifested in this book as well. Augustine is an incredible figure and a role model for modern Christians. His trials are not much different from ours, seeing as we live in a society so obsessed with sex. Augustine's Confessions is one of my favorite books. A must-read for any theologian and philosopher."
4,A combination of philosophy and of effusive love for God,"Confessions tells the story of one man's uncompromising search for truth. Augustine begins with intellectual concessions to the Christian world view and ends with a passionate and personal devotion to God. Confessions also addresses the question, ""How can a sinner have fellowship with a holy God?""Prepare to think abstractly, as Augustine slips often and with little warning into his specialty -- philosophy. Philosophy buffs will find out why many contemporary philosophers such as German philosopher Martin Heidegger pay their respect to Augustine"
1,Brain Tying as Pseudoscience,"Although Mr. Niednagel wants us to believe that the product he is pitching, Brain Typing, is scientifically based, it is really nothing more than just another weary entry from the productive and fertile field of pseudoscience. He uses anecdotes and testimonials to pitch his product with absolutely zero controlled studies that even hint at its effectiveness. The irony of using athletes to promote his product is the common knowledge of athletic superstition.He has every right to sell a product that relies on the expectations, dreams, and wishes of the buyer. This is what American commerce is all about. But, pleeeese!! Don't try to tell us it has any relationship to real science."
5,A new and exciting field!,This book was able to articulate a whole new world to its readers. As a sports professional I found myself wanting more information on how to braintype someone. Excellent job John!
3,Strip the willow,The story is interesting and well written. But i found the print too small and had to abandon it.
2,Um...What?,"To start off, the anime is 5 episodes long; so it's not nearly enough material for the price their asking. And the content...Is lacking, really. Apparently, a punch to the stomach completely strips you of your shirt. ...Seems legit. Anyways, all this really is is a combination of boobs, butts, and blood. Then at the very last episode, I guess they wanted to throw in some big twist, but it really just kinda...Flopped. Overall, I only gave this 2 stars (which is being kind) because the dub is fairly good, the artwork isn't completely horrible, and it had the opportunity to be great (which it definitely didn't end up being).My final verdict: Save your money. Watch it on Netflix or something instead if you really are interested, though."
1,Alot of bobbling about but............ -Jult Warfell,I was hoping to find action packed storytelling and comedy and all I saw was boredom........... Watch it if you must -Jult Warfell
1,One of the worst series ever.,"Despite the horrible title of this series, I Watched the fist maybe 10 mins on Netflix. Within that 10 min, I saw about 10 upskirt shots and an enmey dressed as a flight attendant get her shirt ripped off for no reason, exposing her breasts. If you've run out of hentai to watch, this is for you. But for the rest of us self respecting Otakus, steer clear."
4,Just get it...,"Quite simply, if you enjoyed Ikki Tousen (like I do), you'll enjoy this. The plot is a bit iffy, and the abrupt ending leaves you screaming 'oh, come on!' But overall, the story does entertain and the fighting and gratuitous fan service are great."
3,Fan Service Much?,"I liked this series. I prefer the clean version though (The type that they'd play in Japan on the T.V. where little boxing gloves cover all the woohoos that pop out. Don't get me wrong I think fan service is fine, but in this case it's all to random and happens so often I mean it's t**s GALOR! I mean they'll be fighting and all the sudden BAM! Clothes fly off! So my review has been pretty negative so far right? Well the reason I give this 3 Stars is because, well a lot of people do NOT like the twist at the very end...I however like it. It's very interesting to me...it reminds me that the people making this anime weren't only thinking about Breasts the whole time :) Anyways, If your not around your mama or girlfriend aren't around it's a decent 5 Episode series."
2,False Adevertising,"As you purchase this item it say complete series which is completely incorrect all you get is 5 episodes, now if someone who is in charge wants to fix this problem you might be lucky not sure yet I haven't heard from any one yet"
2,DESPITE THE PRICE DROP....NOT WORTH IT,"there is a martial arts tournament only for women.....and at the end the winner can have anything she wants, but the losers are never seen again. at least that is the rumor about the Martial Hearts tournament that goes around the city. but when a young lady runs into a tournament match between two fighters, she gets drawn into the fight. when her new friend (one of the fighters) disappears she is given the chance to join. can she fight to the end and save her friend, or is their something more sinister afoot.the series is only 5 episodes long, very rushed character development, and the fight scenes are akin to Ikki Tousen where the fighters end up naked. but the ending is a real mind twist when things get revealed. overall not a great series, but had a couple of good points. i would suggest hulu or renting over buying....."
5,Korg CA-30 Solo Chromatic tuner for string instruments,"The Korg CA-30 Solo Chromatic tuner that I bought and now use each time that I tune my guitars. This is very accurate, as accurate as using a piano to tune your guitar. This electronic device is so very easy to use. A beginner in learning to play the guitar can easily tune their guitar with this device. It is as easy as pushing the ON button, plucking a guitar string and the device will tell you exactly what note you played and even if the note was flat or sharp. VERY accurate!!!! I keep mine in my guitar case in its original box to keep it safe. It is also very durable, as it has been dropped one time to the floor, and it suffered no ill effects, it still registers what notes are. My guitar teacher said that he uses a electronic tuner such as this before he plays on stage each time because the audience is too loud to try to tune it by any other means. So this tuner really has its place in my musical life."
4,"Excellent, but not perfect","I've had two of these tuners. They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. They're durable and have a long battery life. Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440. Strange."
2,not my best choice,"It is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it."
5,Perfect Tuner,"The tuner is great. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I used it from 10th grade until 12th during band, and it never failed me. Despite dropping it a thousand times (my friends would make fun of me over how often I would drop it) it never broke, and was always accurate. I would take it with me on competitions and to football games and practice in the parking lot. It is small, fits in a pocket and on a stand, yet durable and accurate. I would recommend to any band student."
4,Korg CA-30,"This tuner was purchased for my first attempt at tuning a piano. It worked flawlessly through the mid range. To reach the highest octave, I purchased Korg's contact microphone, which extended the range to within the highest three notes, with the mic clipped to the sound board. The lowest octave was accessible using a larger microphone that I had on hand, which took me to within the three lowest notes.For the low cost of this product, I am extremely pleased. Do not go into business tuning pianos with this product, but if you deal with instruments, you need to own one!"
1,"OK, But not durable. Meaninless Warranty","I bought one of these tuners three months ago. I have had good luck with other Korg products including tuners. This tuner started operating intermittently and would quit at the worst times (on stage). It has a three year warranty, but, you must buy Korg tuners from an authorized dealer or you are out of luck. At this point I'm not impressed with the tuner or Korg. My replacement tuner will not be a Korg."
4,"Great tool, with just a couple of caveats","I agree with everything else that's been said here and elsewhere on the internet regarding how functional and easy to use this tool is. There are just 2 things I was surprised to find that hadn't been mentioned elsewhere:1) The speaker volume is not adjustable (at least I haven't found the volume button!), and it's too loud for me.2) It can't pick up the highest and lowest octaves on my piano. It's possible that there are too many overtones, or that an external microphone would help, but I'd be surprised if either of those issues are the source of the problem."
3,"inflatable bed review, barbie","The bed in the picture is not the same one that is sent to you. The barbie on the bed I got is dressed up in a pink gown with purple earrings and blond hair. If you are looking at this item, you don't necessarily get the bed design pictured."
5,One Of Progressive Rock's Unsung Descendants,"Strangeitude is an amazing album, particularly for Prog Rock fans who like a more Rock-Guitar sound. It has the traditional Time-Signature changes found in some Progressive Rock, yet keeps a more mainstream sensibility. Some sounds can be dissonant, but they soon melt into tangible music than can be soothing or energizing to different people. Songs like Sploosh (which I refer to as ""music to wash dishes by"" because of the background sounds) will have you moving to the pulse of the music, and the title track had some of the most innovative use of an oscillator on a keyboard that I've ever heard. Truly an incredible album if you would like something out of the ordinary yet familiar enough not to be scary."
5,WOW...,"Since we have a slew of reviews here already, I'll keep this short...WOW!!!I've been curious about this band for a long time. I finally took a chance on this disc. Having read the other reviews, I was expecting something mildly interesting of the ""psychadelic"" persuasion. But I never expected such a technically proficient quasi-prog jam band!To begin, these guys are tight instrumentalists! Each track is river of shifting themes and groovy jams. Rather than actual ""tunes,"" most pieces are simply a skeletal frame for a collage of interveaving jam passages that ebb and flow, carrying you along.It's hard to really lump these guys under any genre label, because they're too weirdly unique. They come accross sounding a little like techno--but only superficially, because they're much deeper than any tecno I've ever heard (I'm no fan of techno).Basically, these guys are impossible to categorize. And after hearing this one disc, I've become an instant fan. :D"
4,Strangeitude (with DVD),"I love the band Ozric Tentacles but da reason 4 stars is because I think that item is a rip off, if you already have strangeitude like I do then dont get rid of it just too REBUY it for the cd with dvd.I am sure they must have that stuff on youtube anyway.I like listening too all their songs on the cd from white wino tea too weirditude but they cut off last 2 songs so if you do rebought it you wont be able too place live throbbe or weirditude else where other than watching it on dvd.They shouldve at least left the cd da way it is if they wanna add da dvd."
4,Great book,"I absoloutely loved this book. It is perfect for anyone studing dance history in general and is the best book I found for studying Ancient Greek dances. I would have given it 5 stars except that it does have a couple drawbacks. 1. No bibliography; so the sources she used to come to her conclusions in the book are hard to validate. 2. The book is written in a rather formal dry way. At times I found that my mind had wondered off(as usually happen when I read books witten in a fromal dry manner) and I had to re-read many of the pages. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient greece or dance hitory in general."
4,It's nice,"Well, after seeing them on soul train, first of all, you know how you see groups on soul train, and you dont think they will be on there again in life, but i have been seeing them and they are very good looking guys, it's a kind of cd that make you look at your man and say, let's go out, let's go have some fun, it's a feel good about your partner and your relationship album, and if you not with nobody sometimes albums like these helps you find some unsuspected men, and help you fall into the habit of being in love for a long time."
1,Used 10 times,"And bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks."
5,Al Green Does Christmas Right,I have been a fan of Al's for over 35 years. He covers both secular and Christian Christmas songs in only the way he can. I was playing this all the time in my car during the holidays. Any Al Green fan will love this.
1,Charging Error,"First time when I plugged in, the cell phone displayed error message that ""Charging Error, remove immediately"". since then I am not using this."
5,= Serenity in Focus,I play this album often in my car and never get tired of it. It brings you back to where you're focus should be with soothing and searching sounds. David has chosen scripture that ministers and speaks to your heart no matter where you're at. I wish he'd record more of the same.
4,could be more accessible,"This dry but somewhat informative book includes hundreds of mini-commentaries about the High Holy Days, mostly from a VERY traditional perspective. Some interesting insights, though could be more accessible- Hebrew and English are often intermingled so freely that a reader without a strong Hebrew background will miss a lot."
1,I will never recommand this to any one.,"I purchased this one last week and I am sending it back today. The unit is great and features are reasonable for price. Major issue is with MAPS. They are worng and they don't have many cities listed. I live in Long Island, NY and i couldn't get to many places here.I called customer support and got them on line with in 3 min ( not bad at all ) and the person who is on the phone was very nice and polite. He has verified and confirmed the locations where I wanted to go are not available in MAPS supplied with unit. As per him this doesn't have updates MAPS and they may not be available for next 3-4 months.I learned that every model GPS don't have same maps. More expensive models has slightly better maps."
2,RoadMate 300,"Works good . . . when it works. This unit will work fine for weeks at a time, then inexplicably loose the signal. It can be literally days before it works again. I have contacted ""customer service"" at Thales, which is a waste of time. On the 2 occasions I contacted them about this problem, I got the same set of trouble-shooting steps, only what the second person told me was in complete reverse order of what the first person told me.The accuracy of the maps can be abysmal. I input an address in downtown Atlanta recently; the directions tried to put me off at an interstate exit that has not existed for over 12 years."
4,Great product and get a SD card with it.,"I love this product. The only thing is that is can only hold a small map in the internal memory. To get around that just buy a 2gig SD card and download the whole US to it then you will never need to download another map again.The unit is compact, comes with everything you need to get started, has great features, what else can you ask for? You can find resturants, stores, anyplace you want. Also the controls are easy to use, and the maps are easy to read."
1,Please check your products before you send them to us as customers,"I orderd the product refurbished believing that it actually was corrected of of all passed problems etc. To make a long story short, it was not and it had several significant problems, from the control pad being unresponsive, antenna being broken and detached, to it's software not being able to reconize satellites. If it work, it would of been a good product for its asking price, but I dont think you as merchants are suppose to be in the business of selling ""if they worked products"".P.S. I was satisfied in regards to the amazon returning policy which allowed me to return the product with the similar ease of buying the product; and also the ups pre-postage that the seller prepaid for so I did not have to pay for shippment in returnning the product. As for rating, the product in the condition that I received it was not worth a star, my real rating: -1 star."
3,Not as advertised,"The item description stated European Base Map loaded in unit. IT WAS NOT. When I opened box in Europe the instructions stated loaded with N. America base map. Thanks for nothing !! And no 512 MB card included as promised. The unit is great, my son tested it in Texas, he said it works well. Other than that I am looking forward to using it someday when I return from Europe."
1,Magellan Roadmate 300,The Roadmate worked well for about two weeks and then quit working. Goodbye $329.00
3,Dog Sled,The book was excellent-the price was subperb- The postal time was obserb-Dog sled could have gotten it here sooner....
5,Big Shots: The Men Behind the Booze,"What a great read. Educational, humorus and really informative. Sometimes with the PR, you aren't always sure what's what, but Baime gives you all the good stuff. I ended up purchasing 5 copies for gifts for the holidays."
1,Skip this one.,"After reading several reviews about this book I sat down to listen with great anticipation, unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. Instead of coming across as a women who is coming into her own, I found her to be shallow and vacuous. Her stories about her life are embarrassing. There are no revelations here."
3,A Year by the Sea,"My book club read ""A Year by the Sea"" and reviews were mixed. Most thought the author needed to get a life."
4,"males and females, open your hearts and your senses to life","I recently attended a storytelling evening given by the Marion Foundation with author Joan Anderson. I had no intention of purchasing Joan's book, but came away with such enthusiasm that I did indeed purchase her book, A Year by the Sea... When I opened the book a few days later, I devoted the entire day to completing it...I see this book as a wake up call to males and females to open your hearts and senses to life and its wonders. I could identify with Joan as she speaks about taking risks, laughing at oneself, really looking at nature and taking time for oneself! Life can be exciting and fulfilling when we take time to wonder at the world around us. These are the messages I came away with; I see her book not necessarily about her relationship with her husband, but with herself. I want to pass these messages along to my mother who needs to look around her at the wonders of life, to laugh, to take risks and to love herself."
2,"""Poor poor pitiful me.""",Whine whine whine. SNAP OUT OF IT! The *only* interesting characters in this self-absorbed and poorly-written retrospective are the seals and they had the good sense to be fleeting. Two Pity Stars.
2,Yawn,I had high hopes for this book...but found it to be very blah blah blah....Sorry but I found it disappointing.
4,A beautifully written story.,"This book was recommended by my book club, and I'm always a little apprehensive that the book will not live up to expectations. This book is wonderfully written; very beautiful, descriptive and I enjoyed following Joan Anderson on her year-long journey and being able to relate with much of her story."
4,Order Received,"Book arrived on time and in good condition. Have not yet read it. Will do so soon.Believe I will enjoy doing so, based on synopsis that I have read. MAE"
2,Not for me,"Although I appreciate the author's view that she, and all of us really, are ""unfinished"", I felt little connection with her. Of course, I am a different person ... single or rather longtime divorced with no children and have been able to focus on what I, as an individual, wants from life. I believe the book simply skimmed the surface of her life and, for me, had little depth. However, I understand why some women would find it appealing or possibly even inspiring."
5,"Captivating Read, Soulful","Read it in one sitting, couldn't put it down on a snowy New England day this past winter.The atmosphere of the book continues to permeate my consciousness. This true life heart-to-heart story is filled with compassion and encouragement. The author's candor in sharing her spiritual journey about self-renewal and self-esteem rings true.A great read and a great help. Can't help but relate my experience with this book with a Web site I've been going to lately -- spirituality.com. There are some great articles there that echo the book's themes and have been encouraging as I continue to ponder the spiritual journey we'll all working on."
1,banal and trite,"I bought this book after reading a raving review and I was totally disappointed. The style is bland and common, the topic - finding and understanding oneself, which I believe is one of life most important feat - is treated in a shallow manner. In our day and age, I also found it difficult to relate to a fifties' American housewife type of issues. But, it could have all been bearable if the book had been well written. It isn't, and it never managed to stir a bit of passion, beauty or compassion. I was bored from beginning to end, and I only kept reading the book in hope that it might improve. There are many better books out there that deal with introspection, meaning of relationships, being oneself, or surrounding oneself in nature and discovering life."
2,Shallow Self-indulgence,"In A Year by the Sea, Joan Anderson writes a shallow memoir lacking both style and complexity. In page after page of superficial metaphors that try too hard, she reveals little about who she is or how she has grown and changed during her ""year off"". Each day becomes more tedious than its predecessor. She hardly paints herself as an inspiration to the reader nor as a sympathetic character. After a three or four chapters it becomes almost embarrassing to read about an adult babbling on like an unfulfilled teenager. The only aspect of the book that seems to work is her attempt to keep hidden from the reader the reasons behind her resentment and anger toward her one dimensional husband."
2,Very disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment -- filled with cliches and platitudes, and shallow ""insights"". Although I certainly never expected it to be another ""The Outermost House"" (HIGHLY recommended), I was expecting *some* depth, or at least detailed thoughtful observations. None to be found. The author has read ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" but has obviously not digested it. Pass this one by."
2,Lightweight and full of self indulgence.,"This book was shallow and the author was self-absorbed and self-indulgent. One can find fulfillment in life without running away from responsibilities. ""no man is an island"", etc. She makes it sound like raising a family was a horrid chore that excluded her! She only barely mentions her parents. She obviously didn't get along well with anyone, not husband, sons, parents, siblings.The opportunity to care for someone else is a gift. Too bad she misses out. Some people are just meant to be ""alone by the sea"", she is obviously one who does not benefit from relationships with others. I don't think she's a roll model for any woman unless you like to whine."
1,Oh Puh-leeze!,"Maybe this woman should have tried living in a homeless shelter if she wanted to find her strength.I've met many courageous people who continue to serve others even while facing incredible obstacles. Living in a cottage by the sea while being supported by a husband (who, incidentally, was good enough to pay the bills yet not worthy of her companionship) is hardly a challenge, except to the husband.Most guys would have found a new girlfriend in about six weeks."
1,"Self-indulgent, self-pitying twaddle","No doubt Joan Anderson was serious when she wrote this silly book about ""discovering herself"" but really, she is so smug and self-centered that her troubles are laughably trivial. I just hated the way she congratulated herself every few paragraphs for her fake humility or for some trite insight she had. She keeps telling us how ""selfless"" she is, but folks that's the lie of the century. This woman's ego is HUGE. It's all about poor, pitiful, martyred Joan and her 25 cent ""insights."""
5,A must for women in their 50's in long term marriages,"I can't remember when I've been so captivated by a book and an author. Was she somehow peering into my own marriage/life? I've just turned 50, have been married to the same man for 30 years and can be counted as one of her readers who is extremely envious of what she has done. Courageous? Yes! Introspective? Definitely! I would truly like to know this woman and sit down with her over coffee or attend one of her ""Weekends by the Sea"". She's given me much insight and inspiration into taking charge of my own personal journey through the rest of my life."
1,Perhaps a year wasn't long enough,"The Kirkus review gets this book well. Joan Anderson comes off as a self-enthralled and rather preachy individual. Despite her complaints about lack of fulfillment she seems entirely too full of herself. The book wears thin, I expect the author would too.Unlike Doris Grumbach she is not someone I could imagine spending and enjoyable afternoon with."
5,Stay at home mom escapes to the Sea.,"I read this book almost a year ago and still remember the feelings of escape I experianced while reading about Joan. I became her in my own desire to escape to Cape Cod. It would be impossible for me to actually follow her actions at this time in my life having two small children, but at least I could experiance the desire to through the author. At least now I know A Year By the Sea is not implausible! Thank you Joan!"
5,Thought provoking...,"Perhaps because I was going through 'that time' of my life as well, I found this story very inspiring. As women, we are often times judged when we take time out for ourselves. But that is what Joan did, and she found out lots of things about herself, that she wouldn't have realized any other way. Would recommend (to women reaching 'middle' age)."
4,Wonderful Read,"I'm married with two children and for the first time, I went to our beach house alone (in the Outer Banks, NC ). I began the book at home and decided to go away to finish it. As I sat on the deck with a glass of wine and the sun setting I have to say, I felt like I was enjoying a visit with a close friend... sharing stories, feelings and lessons learned. I was a bit sad to have it end. It has inspired me to take more time out for myself. I truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of her books!"
4,Required reading for every 40+ woman.,"Its a book that compels one to review their innermost thoughts and feelings. Its a story you read in one sitting and then realize you want to go back and re-read it.The book only brings you to a certain point in her self discovery and leaves the reader yearning for a sequel. It may appear to be a women's book; however, after having forced my husband to read it he also found it enlightening."
5,I THINK SHE MOVED TO THE SEA TO CALM HER SPIRIT!!,I loved the book......I guess because I understood all of her words.....her thoughts. I was actually there with her. A very compelling book. I liked it and would love to meet her one day. So many things I would like to discuss with her.
1,A Year of Navel-Gazing,"From the first page to the last, Joan Anderson reveals herself to be a self-absorbed woman, rather than the self-sacrificing mother and wife she claims to be. Her attempts to ""find"" herself, such as frolicking with seals, taking a job in a fish shop, and befriending another self-obsessed older woman, are stereotypical ""enlightening"" activities -- in other words, the so-called talented writer can't rise above the pedantic. This memoir is an insult to hard-working women who ""find"" themselves in the midst of busy and demanding lives without the convenience of a seaside refuge. Joan Anderson would have done the literary world a service to stay in her cottage and keep her ""unfinished"" thoughts to herself."
3,A good book if you're experiencing life changes,"I could identify with many of the issues that Joan Anderson was facing; the life changes, my choices and life fulfillment. It is a beautiful book at times, but at other times the author comes off a bit whiny. Still, overall, I give Joan Anderson a thumbs up for having the courage to leave the familiar and to take risks in finding something more and ultimately in the end, finding yourself and your own voice."
4,A Year by the Sea,Very interesting journey and the following books written by Joan Anderson expand on her experiences.
5,I was pretty surprised,"I'm not a Robin fan, so buying this was a bit of a gamble. However, I'm glad I did. To me, Robin always came off as a dork in over his head based on some of the comics and cartoons I've seen him in.In this comic, Robin acts like a proper detective partner. His jokes actually add to his character in comparison to Batman. Alfred goes so far as to hint that Robin is more socially adaptive capable. Batman has to make Bruce as an extreme extrovert to balance his self. Robin is still emotionally and psychologically Dick with a mask on.The narrative by Alfred added a nice view of the father/son relationship between Bruce and Dick. The art gave some neat constrasts by calling back to Adam West style Batman visual themes. For the $10 I paid for this, it's a treasure."
3,Did not fit my 1996 cavalier base coupe.,This product Did not fit my 1996 cavalier base coupe inspite of amazon listing as it will fit. The return shipping was a hassle and the moeny refund wasn't immediate. overall wasn't happy. The product seems well made but wrong part.
5,"1996 Chevrolet Cavalier 2.4L, Manual Transmission","I replaced a bosal unit that was on the car approximately 2.5 years. The converter on that unit plugged (to be fair probably from a lack of tune up and dumping fuel into the exhaust, another story) but the big problem was that it used a braded steel connection between the exhaust manifold flange and the exhaust pipe. The connection first started to leak, then completely broke. very noisy. This unit has larger diameter exhaust pipe, a more secure pipe to manifold flange connection, and the O2 sensor bung is angled for a better fit. The unit tucks into the body structure very nicely so it will not drag over speed bumps. Overall, my Cavy is working 100% better with this unit, longevity will be the next hurdle. Vehicle is a 1996 Chevrolet cavalier convertible, 2.4L DOHC engine, 5 speed manual trans."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"The concept is good. However, after reading all the wonderful reviews, I expected a higher success rate with my eggs. The water measuring accessory is useless because the markings are barely legible, so I have to use measuring spoons. The buzzer has sounded only twice in the dozens of times I've tried to use it. It's hard to adjust the water amount to get an egg done just the way I like it, with semi-soft yolk. And the plastic cups require the usual scrubbing."
2,not so great!,it did not completely make the yolk hard boiled- it was still a little gooey-- and when you paoched- the yolk was hard and not gooey! would not buy this product again. in fact if i cul dfind the friggin box i would even return it!
5,Great egg cooker,"I bought this egg cooker to eat healthier. I find it GREAT. it is just the right size, and makes the eggs perfectly. I poach, and scramble eggs in it all the time. If you want a nice little egg cooker, I really suggest investing in this fine product."
4,does the job,Does soft cooked and poached to our liking. Only complaint is the water-level markings on the plastic cup are hard to read. But we're happy with the purchase.
4,Refreshing and relaxing,"If you want to listen to beautiful Disney music at night time, it's your best choice."
3,Muzak-ie?,"I like much of this for background stuff, but my wife says it sounds like Muzak and she wants to barf. Well, we don't want that, now, do we?"
1,Poor quality,"Upon trying this on, the first thing that became clear was the cheapness of the zipper, which feels like it's going to catch and break at any moment. Secondly, the poor quality of the vinyl used makes noise with every move you make. And third, the lapels wouldn't fold like they are in the picture, even after I tried to weigh it down with books (heat would not be an option for the material).There are better quality costumes out there at similar pricing, try one of those."
5,Delightful,"This tea was a real delight! I'm a big fan of white tea and this is one of the best varieties I have tried. The flavor is very subtle and not overpowering at all. You get a nice peach flavor that isn't too sweet yet not at all bitter, but you can still taste the light flavor of the smooth white tea. Celestial Seasonings Imperial White Peach White Tea is now one of my favorite teas and I can see myself going back to it time and time again. It is really pleasant and I definitely recommend it, especially to those who love white tea."
4,Should be read in school,"While the right wingers will hate it....who cares about them they don't like you anyways. This is a book that gives you stats to back up what she says(not the lies of the likes of mathew fraser)A must read if you like Moore, or Frankin"
1,Too Bad!,"I used this unit on a very moderate basis for about a year and a half and then it stopped working properly. Naturally, the warranty had expired. I called the customer service number to ask about paid repair service and was told that there were no authorized repair stations and in fact, it couldn't be repaired. They did offer to sell me another at a reduced price which wa more than I paid for the unit initially. To sum it up, it worked well while working but didn't stand up and then, regardless of my willingness to pay, it can't be repaired. Seems to me that a unit of this cost should last for a long time and repairs should be possible."
1,Not reliable,"This coffee maker barely lasted 4 months. When it worked it was great, but now it is pretty useless. The thermostat must be out because it heats for about 30 seconds and then shuts off. I can no longer make coffee with it. I would not recommend this item."
2,Poor Construction,"I purchased this urn in February 2001 and since had the lid replaced once, repaired once, and the whole unit exchanged once. This to me is unacceptable for a coffee machine in this price range. When it works, its great and handsome, however three repairs in five months leaves me wondering about how dependable this unit is."
1,"Great Concept, Poor Quality","What a great concept for a towable, really a good idea to be sure! And it would have been a real winner if only Rave put some quality into the product but that was clearly lacking - quality so poor it deserves a Razzie. From the time we put it to water it lasted less than an hour before both rooster tail skegs came off and the starboard sponson bladder tore and deflated making the tube unsafe to use. Since then, I have gone round and round with Rave's customer service to no satisfaction and it has been three weeks now; it sits in my garage, nearly $400 of potential summer fun, worthless. My suggestion, steer clear of the Rave brand as one can only assume this level of quality and service pervades the entirety of their offerings. If you do take the risk it is an undeniably stable platform for smaller riders and in the short time it did last, it was a blast! Caveat Emptor! (let the buyer beware)"
3,Product is okay,"After ordering this product, I started canning with it and where the handles were attached to the canner, it started to leak water down the side and onto my stove. I sent it back to amazon and got a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement did the same thing. I then called Back to Basics directly, and they sent me a new one. They said that they had problems with handles leaking a year or so ago. Therefore, Amazon's product is an old product. Since I received the new one, directly from the Company, I have not had any problems with it! The canner fits 7 jars perfectly."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I purchased this item as part of a Christmas present for my wife as she loves to can. The Pot has already rusted out and large blue paint chips have flaked off the inside of the pot. There's no way on Earth this pot should be used for edible goods. This manufacturer should be banned from selling this useless product. I am beyond incensed.
5,OHHHHHHHHHHH YEah!,"Okay, I've noticed that a lot of kids reviews have been misspelled and misjudged. Mine, however is not. this games kicks butt! The gyro chip and the rumble pak add a great new ""twist"" to gameplay. I have been playing the old warioware games for quite awhile now and I have to say, this makes the old ones look horrible. (No offense DS owners, but this is WAY better than Touched! :))"
5,One of GBA's best!,"Wario Ware has always been wacky and fun,but now it goes beyond that with new tilt control.Any Wario Ware fan will instantly love it,while others new to the series may want to start with the original game before playing this.The game is way better than the DS wario ware and maybe even better than the orignal!Pros:-Controlling with the tilt sensor is easy and fun-A whole bunch of sovoniers to unlock (over 130)-Works great with all three systems:GBA,GBASP,and DS-Put it in your DS with WW Touched to unlock an extra toy for touchedCons:-Disapointing final boss-Those darned telephone numbers!"
5,Wow! My head is spinning,"I loved the microgames in previous Wario titles, but these are a whole lot of fun mainly due to the gyroscope (a sensor that knows when you are turning the GBA). I think this one beats the DS version TOUCHED simply beause it is easier to grasp and use without the stylus. Playing this one in public will get you some odd looks too. Lots of secrets to unlock. Definitely replay all the levels several times - there's a lot to unlock in here. This is a great game for all ages and all skill levels. That's the real draw. The whole family can fight over who's turn it is."
4,Grrr....,(...)Wario man has a very hard boss but if you beat him there is a very funny cut scene.I'm still mad.... Grrrr....Yes I knoe evryone boo me. (...)
3,Oh Man,First let me tell you that i'm a big Nintendo fan making my faviorte game Wario Touch for the Nintedo DS. But the story on this was shorter than the touch and easier. Nintendo though did do somthing wild and crazy again so I rewarded them with that and with some fun mini games. Otherwise I thought it was not one of the best games meaning short story that only took you a few minutes to beat but was very entertaining. So I would recomend this game to any die hard Nintendo fans but not knew comers.
1,Terrible,"Honestly, this game was awful. It has bad graphics and it really isn't very fun at all.Don't buy this game...get one of the Mario or Zelda games instead!"
4,good for Bikram,"I drop one tablet in my water bottle before Bikram class and I really like drinking the flavored water adn think the electrolyte boost is a big help. I got the multipack to test the various flavors, and though I don't love them all equally, it was a good way to see the options before ordering several of just one flavor."
2,Caution: Sorbitol and hydration don't mix for everyone,"While this product contains electrolytes and one would think would be good for hydration, the product also contains SORBITOL, a LAXATIVE. The laxative effect may actually be strong enough to off set the hydration effect and cause DEHYDRATION. This is an ironic product ingredient choice. Do not use this product if sorbitol has a strong laxative effect on you or if you are trying to keep a good electrolyte balance in a person who is ill."
1,No ingredients listed,"I have fructose malabsorption and can not have sorbitol, it kills me with pain if I have even a very small amount of it. This product review is not for the product itself, but for the way they advertise no sugar, when it does have sorbitol. Listing ingredients should be a requirement when sugars have been substituted. I wish I could return it, but they don't take returns either.Thank you!"
5,Taste Good,"These tablets are an athlete's best friends! I carry these tablets as supplements to my supplies of already made GU brew when I go out on extra long bicycle rides. After depleting my bottles, I simply refill my bottles and plop a few of these tablets in. They taste great and are easy on my stomach. Low calories, low sugar. My favorite flavor is the tri berry. For my the ironman that I will be doing in May, these will be in my list of items I will be carrying."
5,Great hydration drink,"I've stopped drinking Gatorade and I now drink Nuun. Nuun does not have sugar. This makes cleaning water bottles much easier, and it does not leave sticky residue on your bike when it spills."
4,a totem of hard sci-fi,"This is a classic of didactic science fiction. The author mapped out the implications of a pancake-shaped planet, especially the implications of the wide variation in gravity between the equator and the poles. The story is an adventure that follows a human (initially) and a group of natives from the equator to near the south pole, describing the challenges they face en route. The book compels by virtue of Clement's vision and originality, but any page without a new creature or climatic development is dull."
5,"Hardest of the hard SF - no sex or language, minimal violenc","Technically a juvenile book, mostly because it eschews sex, rough language, and all but minimal violence, this quest novel describes the interaction of a human with the inhabitants of a high (and variable) gravity planet. As with all of Clement's work, one emphasis is on accurate and careful extrapolation of the hard science (mostly physics).Although I have classified it as a juvenile, it is certainly entertaining for all age groups; vocabulary and descriptions do not necessarily fit into the juvenile category. This book is one of the best possible introductions to science fiction for a younger reader.'Mission of Gravity' is Hal Clements's best work"
5,"Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity is the ""creme de la creme""","I have been an avid science fiction reader since the early 50's. There is no better ""hard"" science fiction book than ""Mission of Gravity"". I have heard it called a ""juvenile"" book because no child could be offended by reading it, but I think only an adult can fully appreciate the science involved. Looking back on 45 years of reading science fiction, I rate ""Mission of Gravity"" as the very best I have ever read."
3,it's ok,"I decided, as I acquired my new kindle, to read all of the Nebula and Hugo award nominees going back to their beginnings. So, this book came to my attention.I was just never engaged in the story. My only reason for turning the pages was to complete a checkmark on my list. I think that is what I most felt that turned me off. Now, the reasons I felt that way were: i felt no sympathy for any of the characters, wasn't engaged with them at all really, and the story was very.... antiseptic. By this I mean that I nveer felt myself caring about the trials tribulations, or successes of the parties involved.I didn't mind reading it. It was creative. But I just can't find much to recommend it."
4,"There is something to be said for escaping reality, ya know.","So, it's over the top, outrageous, ridiculous even. But, it's so dang funny -- And, you'll actually root for the serial killer, who's not all that bad.You absolutely must have a sense of humor to read Dorsey. It's not cartoon-y, more of a futuristic Keystone cops on bad dope, perhaps?Anyway, the Florida historical information is rich and believable and Dorsey includes enough truth in his work to make you think maybe the Sunshine state residents are sniffing the Coppertone a bit too enthusiastically.If you need an escape and can't afford a plane ticket or the time to get away, try this book (or any of the other Dorsey novels) and you'll emerge refreshed and perhaps a bit stunned, but you'll know you've been somewhere."
3,I'm in the minority here!,"I have to admit, this is the first Tim Dorsey book I have read. I was really looking forward to reading it, because I have read all of Carl Hiassen's books about whacky Florida characters and have enjoyed them. I guess I was looking for another Hiassen. So I was disappointed in Dorsey's book. He clearly is no Hiassen, though he's trying hard to be. I found Serge A. Storms' character to be ""unlovable."" There were too many subplots introduced that could have readers scratching their heads and having a difficult time following along. As I got closer to the end of the book, I found it harder to pick up and finish. But I did. I won't be picking up any more of Dorsey's books, unfortunately."
3,pointless,"But humorous. This tale is too complicated to even begin to describe. Serge and his dopehead buddy Lenny never grew up, and take a wild romp through Miami under the guise of a tourism business. Lots of gangsters, shootings, diamonds, trying to find out what happened to grandpa Sergio, etc. The plot jumps back and forth over a 40 year span and becomes way too hard to try to follow.. just enjoy the pointless laughs."
5,Serge Up To His Old Tricks,I zipped through Cadillac Beach in no time and loved it. In the continued saga of Serge A. Storm - Dorsey continues to weave an excellent tale. This book gave some good insights into the character of Serge based on his early life. There were a few really interesting plot twists during Cadillac Beach - I couldn't put the book down.I can't wait for Tim DOrsey's next book and the continued life of Serge A. Storm. This was a really good read (for those who aren't looking for a really serious read) and highly recommend it - although it would be good to read a couple of the earlier Dorsey books prior to reading Cadillac Beach.
3,Cadillac Beach book,Bought as gift for my son. Was a little dissapointed in the condition of the book. It was suppose to have been new but it looked used.
4,Dorsey Delivers Again!!,"There must be something about the air in Florida..at least as to how it affects some of those who chose to write about the life there, i.e. Carl Hiassen and Tim Dorsey. In this book it is Dorsey's turn and he doesn't miss a zany beat with the return of Serge A. Storms, a one man crime wave. All I can say is, if you want to enjoy yourself, pour a cool one and put on your safety belt before taking off on this adventure. It is non-stop zaniness and the writing is first rate."
4,Might even merit 5 stars,"This book was too funny: chuckles aplenty and even lots of laugh-out-loud moments... assuming of course you have a twisted sense of humor. The plot bounces around both time and location, deftly weaving several subplots together in a surreal stitchwork.Think of Hunter Thompson giving a tour of Miami's cultural highs and lows, with you strapped to the passenger seat, and you begin to get an idea of what's in store (especially since our favorite serial-killing anti-hero has decided to open a TRAVEL AGENCY for ""Serge's Florida Experience"".)Fans of Dorsey will certainly love this, and newcomers will either be entranced or repulsed by the author's over-the-top, in-your-face approach. This is great stuff, for the ""right"" kind of people."
5,vacation book,Vacation book! Dorsey is always a great vacation read. No thinking involved but always entertaining and occaisional Bon mots. Dat's all.
1,very sad movie,"I do not see how a cat lover could like this movie. A boys cat becomes human and wants to find his family. While searching for his family they find out that a lot of cats were KILLED by research group doing a study. Then at the end of the movie the cat does find his family on a farm with lots and lots of other homeless cats. Then the boy abandons his cat at the farm with the other homeless cats. sad movie, sad ending. IF you really love cats like I do then DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE."
2,is this the whiskers that its talking about?,"if it is, Whiskers is about a cat that turns into a human by the magic of an Egyptian Cat at a local museum. Its REALLY strange and kind of stupid. I was laughing at some parts. It's a good family movie to watch, if you like the corny type!"
1,Do Not Buy!,Well I purchased this shirt about a week ago for and airsoft operation i was attending. When the package arrived it looked good so I didn't assume anything was wrong at that point... Then I opened it and to my surprise the shirt was terrible. The quality of the material was horrible and the seams had been sown wrong causing the entire shirt to twist and be unwearable. I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would suggest to pay a little more to get something that would actually be functional.
1,its the worst product i ever bought,it did not work for me as I expected I spend all that money for the product an it did noting
1,Not as described,"This product does not actually have hydroquinone in it, despite what the description says. I haven't decided if I will keep it or return it yet so I can't say how well it works."
5,Beautifully Done! Don't get caught without HOPE and MORE HOPE!,"David Teems weaves together scripture after scripture in almost a story form. His voice alone brings great comfort and HOPE - add that with the WORD OF GOD washing you soul - truly PRICELESSI have loaned mine to many people. They play it in their children's room when, after the loss of a loved one, they could not sleep, I have played it myself when dealing with one tragedy after another and everything was spinning out of control and Peace settled in the room and sleep came and HOPE was planted once again in my heart."
5,Recomendable,"Muy buena película, buenas actuaciones y un tema muy conmovedor y actual, Es de esas películas para terner en tu colección, se las recomiendo ampliamente"
3,"Great movie, bad picture quality","What a great movie BUT horrible picture quality on this DVD edition. looks awful at all. artifacts, bad color quality thru the hole movie."
4,If you love H.G. Wells,"If you love H.G. Wells and have the urge to want to own The Invisible Man and read short stories from this great king of science fiction I suggest buying this inexpensive book.The 17 short stories included take up 178 pages, here is a list of them. I know I wanted to know.The Crystal Egg, The Man Who Could Work Miracles, The Plattner Story, The Strange Orchid, The New Accelerator, The Diamond Maker, The Apple, The Purple Pileus, A Dream of Armageddon, Aepyornis Island, In the Abyss, The Star, The Lord of the Dynamos, The Story of Davidson's Eyes, In the Avu Observatory, The Sea Raiders, and Filmer."
4,Great Value for all of you Sci-Fi Lovers,All books written by Wells has proven themselves worth their salt as all time sci-fi classics. This collection of stories is sure to please all of the most avid readers expecting great imagination.
5,delightfully smooth and relaxing tea...,"I have enjoyed Madagascar Vanilla Red Rooibos tea from the first time I found it available while shopping for teas. I am no longer able to find it in stores...or if I do it is very, very, rare. I am so glad to be able to order online and have this wonderful tea delivered to my door. I always order 6 boxes...my family and friends love it also."
2,Tasteless and bland...meh.,"I bought this based on it's many good reviews since I've tried and enjoyed many rooibos teas. To my dismay, other reviewers tastes and mine do _not_ agree. I found this tea to be almost tastless, no real vanilla flavor that I can discern. I even tried using two bags and it didn't help.Adding milk and sugar just made for a mug of sweet-tasting slightly tea-flavored hot water...quite unappealing. Like another reviewer, I also noticed the slight ""good tobacco"" odor when I opened the box, very weird for a tea."
5,Lovely and comforting,"This is one of my favorite teas. It's sweet enough that I don't need to add anything to it, it has that wonderful vanilla aroma and taste, plus it's caffeine-free and full of antioxidants on top of it all. It's light and fresh, completely different from other herbal teas or the white, green and black teas most people usually drink. Love it."
3,"Wonderful tea, clearly not fresh","I've bought this at my local grocer for some time and love it so I was happy to see it here. However, what I got here was stale and required 2 bags instead of 1 for the same cup of hot water. The teabags seem really stale. I would not recommend buying this tea here, especially since it ends up costing alot more (if you have to use twice as much tea). Plus you can't return it."
5,"Oh, my stars in heaven","I have to say that I bought this box of tea while on drastic sale at a discount warehouse. I paid like 70 cents for the box. I figured if I didn't like it, I would just toss it since I paid so little.I was needing something to replace the chai tea that Lipton used to make that I can no longer find in the store.So, I brewed up a up one night, added a bit of sugar and some half and half and about died.This is the BEST tea I've had in a long time. It was just sweet enough to not leave that ""tea"" taste in my mouth, but not so sweet that I was gagging. I love the scent of the hot tea when it's brewing. I love the scent of the tea bag. I love everything about this tea.I knew absolutely nothing about it before I purchased it, so it's nice to know it still has the same amount of antioxidents as green tea and that it's caffiene free. My daughter loves this tea much better than any others she's tried.As soon as possible, I intend to buy some more!"
1,No thank you,"I love tea, drink A LOT of it, and just really cannot stand this Vanilla Red tea. It has a soapy or waxy component to the taste for me. Perhaps it's the flavoring or perhaps it's the red tea, but I cannot tolerate the tea at all."
5,Great Tea,"I love this tea. It's not real strong, but it has a great flavor. I don't like my tea really sweet and this one is mild enough it doesn't require sugar."
5,Warmth on a Rainy Day,I love this tea. It reminds me of a rainy day where you are staying in your warm home. There are 2 teas I drink daily and this is one of them.
4,Good stuff,This is one of our favorite flavors from Celestial Seasonings. Perfect for those cold evenings in front of the fire.
2,Image misleading,"I ordered this tea as a gift hoping to get Gogi berry pomegranate tea as is represented in the product image. I was sorely disappointed to receive only pomegranate tea. While this may seem like a slight difference, the recipient of the gift was highly disappointed."
4,Wonderful little pond!!!,"I really love this little pond (it's 31 gallons) it's perfect for my small backyard. It took longer than the two hours mentioned to install, it took me the entire day. But, it was time well spent! You do need to add your own rocks and landscaping to 'pretty it up' but, that's the fun and creative part! I was a bit disappointed when the 'waterfall' didn't seem to make as much noise as I would have liked, I wanted to enjoy the sound of cascading water...but, not problem. I added a 'pond spitter' which not only gave me the sound I wanted, it also adds much visual interest! Adding the spitter was easy, I simply needed a diverter from the local garden center (about three dollars) and added it to the existing hose! I also added a solar powered spotlight to it, so it's just as enjoyable at night. I really am enjoying it, and would definitely reccommend this to anyone who always wanted a pond but has 'limited' space!"
4,The Complete Canvasworker's Guide: How to Outfit Your Boat Using Natural or Synthetic Cloth,"My son just bought his first sailboat - a wooden ""fixer"" but she floats. I have been asked to help with the sewing projects required for her restoration. Very helpful book - was hoping for more info on seat cushions as they are so different from regular household cushions in shape. Overall very good!"
2,Not really a COMPLETE guide,"This COMPLETE guide only includes projects for sailing yachts. Although a couple of the projects can be applied to larger power boats/cruisers it's a significant omission that isn't mentioned on the book's cover which refers to ""Boats"". It's not just yachties who work to a budget or like to try DIY projects."
2,I was expecting more,"Not very good descriptions and sketches, there is a lot of information missing so to name it complete guide compared to older books. It is the first glimpse into the matter for novices."
4,Boat Cover Chapter,I purchased the book with my first project in mind. I planned to make a boat tarp for my husband's small fishing boat. This chapter of the book was excellent for this. Even if you don't have a sailing vessel much of the information in the book can be used or adapted to cover / bag anything you like in canvas. Very usefull.
1,I can't rate it....,"I never got this text! I ordered four books, this one has yet to be delivered to me. I have sent emails to the seller and have never gotten a response, same thing when I emailed Amazon. I did check this book out of the library to read for a class...it is an excellent Novel-I highly recommend it, just not from this seller."
2,boring w/a Capital B,"Tried to read this little ""ditty"" for a book club next month. Couldn't get past the first 10-20 pages. True to my beliefs: if a book doesn't suck me in in the first 10-20 pages I'm on to higher ground. Kathryn Stewart"
5,Love Medicine,"Love Medicine, along with many other of Erdrich's novels, is amazing. This book, however, is challenging, so if you don't want to have to work things out, it's not for you. There are 8 narrators within this novel and it is not told in a linear fashion. Additionally, this novel is part of a collection that Erdrich has written, so things are left out that the reader finds out when reading her other books. Yes this book ""jumps around"" and repeats things from different perspectives, but Erdrich does so to give the reader a more in-depth look at the situation. Having read this novel two times, I also feel that one gains so much more after reading it again.This book is challenging, enlightening, and wonderful. There are so many nuances tied into Erdrich's words which are fun to discover."
3,It's OK,Maybe it's not what I expected so maybe that's why I'm disappointed. Story was so-so. I have not read Erdrich before so had no idea of her style. The treatment by the nuns was a confirmation of my mother's stories from her youth in South Dakota. So sad. I did not think the Chippewa Tribes were in ND. More Wisconsin and Minnesota. The alcohol problem is very real on most reservations.
4,love medicine,Book had no markings inside but had minor X on outside indicating its used status. Was also pleased that this particular edition had all chapters of its original version.
3,Great imagery and characters but somehow not memorable,"On my belated discovery of Louise Erdrich through her blog, I started with this book on the recommendation of a friend. And while I wasn't disappointed in the vividness department, I felt oddly unsatisfied at the end. Honesty and strong imagery in depicting the dark and self-destructive behavior of one's characters is good... but allowing them on occasion to have some insight into themselves and that behavior would be even better. I'm not giving up - Ms Erdrich is a wonderful writer. But next time I think I'll choose a book she herself has mentioned as a favorite. This Kindle edition, by the way, suffers from more annoying typos than it should."
4,Great Taut Working Class Drama,This is a surprisingly strong film about labor and family relations in small French suburb. This earlier feature by one of France's rising stars of Cinema (see his exceptional TIME OUT) is heart breaking in it's depection of factory life and the mutability of family ties. With excellent real life performances the films near documentary style only adds to it's power.
2,Tendentious Agitprop,"The acting is strong, the plot is initially intriguing, and it's enjoyable for about the first hour. But then it descends into cliches -- upright workers who care about craftsmanship and their fellow man, heartless management without values whose greatest pleasure is eliminating jobs -- and the plot becomes schematic and hard to fathom. There's one black in the factory, and it's of course him that befriends the oh-so-earnest lead character, as if blackness confers moral superiority. You know where we're headed, and it isn't a Tea Party convention.With an RT rating of 97, most viewers will undoubtedly enjoy the film. But there's probably 20% like me who will intensely dislike its jejune politics."
5,Happiness Yiddish Style,"Klezmorem is the name given to itinerant Jewish musicians traveling european backroads playing for all classes, both Jewish and non-jewish. Many were self-trained in their art. The clarinet was one of the most popular instruments of this type of group. Many early players came here to escape anti-semiticviolence and avoid being drafted into the military service of Russia. Tarras was one of the most famous clarinetists of all time. His playing reflected the many moods of the Jewish people. Its impossible to listen to this music without getting up and dancing yourself. The selections reflect the many moods of Jewish life. This is #2 of Tarras cds.Tarras, Bradwein, Musicker are among the many greatKlezmorem availablen cds. Bear in mind that many cdsare taken from rare 78s of the early 20th century.Don't let this deter you from enjoying this wonderful music."
2,Michael Flately is not Irish step dance,"As an Irish step dancer who is always trying to set the record straight about what exactly we do, this movie is really frustrating. Riverdance, and even the first Lord of the Dance, were much better representations of Irish step dance. This ""Gold"" is not. ... Michael Flately *used* to be the best we had to offer.... To any serious Irish dancer, he's a joke. Yes, he's brought Irish step dance to the forefront, but most of what he does personally is a combination of many different styles. At least in Riverdance, he kept to mainly Irish choreography. Movies like this give such a wrong impression to anybody who is not personally involved with Irish dance. ..."
3,no english sub titles,"this film is OK we watched it in Hindi,don't understand much. this dvd doesn't come w/ any sub-titles at all. only learned what the film is about from the back of the case. but still enjoyed it."
1,When will it ship......,"I'd like to actually write a review about the book but, it takes 3 months to ship the book. That's right, I ordered the book on April 17th and no I find out that it won't ship until June 12th. What are they doing, making the paper by hand?!Maybe by the end of the year, I'll write a proper review."
4,"Disturbing, Haunting, but strangely Beautiful","While not beautiful in its message, this comic has gorgeous artwork hauntingly realized by Miran Kim. At times, the art is almost impossible to distinguish from photographs, albeit distorted, double-exposed ones. The story, however, is troubling. There is a lack of coherence in the interweaving narratives, and a person leaves with as many unanswered questions as they had when opening this book. This book is definitely not for the squeamish, as the sexual content focuses entirely on bizarre bondage kink and also a rape. Needless to say, while I enjoyed the lush artistry and daring narrative of this comic, the content itself, as well as the lack of any resolution, left me slightly disturbed"
5,"Ideas for children and adults alike, this book is wonderful!","Rainy Day Activity has plenty of ideas to keep kids and adults busy, no matter what the weather! The recipes for making clay, bubbles and other fun stuff has kept my daughter happily occupied. Her favorite recipe is for fake scars- you have to try it to believe it! There are many, many ideas here that cannot be found anywhere else. A fresh approach to ""Mom, I'm bored!"""
4,Good Book,Leonard Griffith is a very good christian theologian and i strongly recommened this and other books by him for anyone interested in christianity.
4,well written,because of bible saying not to adopt pagan ways. but it did give a lot back on Halloween. well written.
3,Sometimes Danger comes in pretty Packages,The best that can be said about this book is that it is a wake up call to parents. As opposed to another reviewer the bible DOES speak about the evil that some of Halloween represents. This book does seem to paint with a rather broad brush. Their are 'some' issues about the beginnings of Halloween that are purely evil. If you have concerns about the foundations please read it. But read with a open mind.
5,Finally on DVD the Right Way!,"Thank you, Casa Negra, for finally releasing great Mexican horror films with the attention they deserve. Gone are the days of these under-appreciated movies being rendered practically unavailable. I just watched this DVD and was amazed by the sound and video quality (especially considering it's age). It's great to know these movies can be resurrected, and that such effort is put into the details.I'm definitely looking forward to future releases."
3,not my cup of tea.,"personally i felt the book sucked, was long, boring, etc.however, it is very well written, arguments are backed, etc. Kerber wrote a masterpeice if this subject interest you.i only read it for class. so if your looking for some quick info about the book:the main point of it is republican motherhood: the idea that women in the revolution could have a political influence, without being able to vote, by shaping the ideals and morals of their children, boys to vote and lead, and the girls to raise other good boys.i would definately read the entire introduction 2 times as it overviews the whole book. the last 10 pages are worth reading too"
3,An Overlooked John Barry Score,"After years of obscurity, the complete soundtrack to ""Game of Death"" (1978) is finally available. Composer extraordinaire John Barry contributes an occasionally thrilling score for a mostly fraudulent Bruce Lee film. When the real Bruce shows up during the final 20 minutes, the orchestral accompaniment packs a tremendous punch. Though a bit repetitive, Barry delivers hard-hitting action music worthy of his best 007 efforts."
1,Not that great,"The movie was good, but the soundtrack stinks. I gave one star to the only 2 good tracks on the soundtrack. the song ""will this be the song i sing tomorrow"" and ""the faceoff with hakim."" other than that no need to buy this soundtrack."
5,Outstanding family movie,"This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, from small children to grandparents. It is emotionally touching and full of adventure with no objectionable language or scenes."
5,Great adoption story,This was a really sweet movie about the adoption of a very hurt little girl and how helping take care of some rabbits at a nearby farm kind of brought her out of herself and helped her to focus on something besides her own pain. She ends up being adopted by her foster family after they finally win her trust. A great family movie and good acting to boot.
3,Needs more bunnies,"I love bunnies which is why I purchased it, but I was very disappointed. I was hoping to see more of the bunny and bunny type antics, but only a minimal amount of time was spent on the rabbit. If I had known I would not have purchased the DVD."
4,i like it just as it is,"I'm too alone in the world, yet not alone enoughto make each hour holy.I'm too small in this world, yet not small enoughto be simply in your presence, like a thing-just as it is.One can approach this translation as a purist, eyeing the metre like a hawk or as a lover of beauty. how many music ""lovers"" do we know who can extol this tenor or that, this composer or that, but are unable to simply relax into the music, like dropping into a feather bed?! This translation is a feather bed; it may be made of fake materials, but who cares - the words, the images, the meanings are so delicate and close to the heart that it warms up and then one's intellect ceases to care. Let us not be too tight. Or as Rilke says:I want to unfold.let no place in me hold itself closed,for where I am closed, I am false."
2,Traduttore traditore,"I don't read German, but I do read poetry, often in translation. The authors offer the following example of their method: two of Rilke's lines that translate literally asYet as I also lean into myself:My God is dark and like a web.they ""improve"" as follows:But when I lean over the chasm of myselfit seemsmy God is darkand like a web.The literal translation is obviously so far superior to the meddled-with version that I can only assume that they destroyed other poems as well.I gave two stars instead of one only because some of the poems turned out nicely in spite of the authors' efforts."
1,Horrendous Translations,"These translations are not faithful to the text and full of omissions Rilke never condoned. These translators are not translator; they are editors with a strong bias and specific agenda. If you are interested in reading Rilke for what he actually was, I would look into another translation. GREATLY disappointed with this edition. Rilke is one of my favorite poets and I wish I had never bought this book."
1,How to trivialize and impoverish Rilke,"I love Rilke, but this book has little to do with him. It is, rather, an exercise in how to trivialize and flatten a great poet. It does not even merit the title of ""translation,"" since the authors freely modify Rilke's rich imagery, metaphors, and phrases, and replace them with simplified formulas. Occasionally they even omit entire parts from a given poem, under the pretext that these parts are not good enough!! What a violent pretentiousness in relation to one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.For those who want to read Rilke, I strongly advise not to bother with this book."
4,Translations,"To those who criticize this translation, so what?1) What survives translation is the poetry and 2) You say that the German is so much better, where is your proof?You deny those, who don't read German, a way into Rilke's mind. You frighten them off with distinctions they might never understand because in you're arrogance you demand they must."
1,"A failure to seriously TRY to translate, really...",Weak and floppy translations. For people who want poetry--and probably everything in life--to be easy.
5,Amazing!,"Drawing on the hidden places in the psyche, Rilke takes us to the depths where we can renew ourselves again and again."
5,best deoderant ever,This really is the best deoderant ever. Lasts and smells almost like perfume. Have been using it for years can be hard to find so it is a lot easier to order it. Has a sort of spicy smell along with the rose smell like a musk. Nothing else on the market really compares to this.
2,Rather disappointing. Not very rosey!,"I was looking for a very full-flavored rose tea. I drink a lot of Celestial Seasonings, so I was excited when this came out. I was disapponted, however, in the lack of rose fragrance or flavor. It tastes more like spice tea, with only the lightest hint of vanilla and no discernable rose flavor. If I had blind-tested the tea, I would have said I like it. But since I expected roses, it was a disappointment."
5,"Great, funny book with good facts and paintings","My daughter read this book for a class report, and we liked the fact that this book coincidentally was written as though it was a child's report about Van Gogh. She was intrigued to find out that Van Gogh sold only one painting in his lifetime, and was not a rich artist. The humor in the writing and illustrations make this book accessible, fun, and informative, and help kids relate the artist's life. The evolution of Van Gogh's painting style beginning with Potato Eaters and the influences on his art are discussed in understandable terms. It was fun to learn that throughout his life, Vincent's best buddy was his brother Theo, even though they fought as siblings often do. The book contains many photos of Van Gogh's actual paintings. Great book. We both recommend it."
5,From the bottom of my heart....this book is a jewel !,"With this book I got started in buddhism about 3 years ago and I must say that it did touch my heart. It explains in a very understandable and pure way how we can get rid of our negativities, overcome the obstacles on our way and live a meaningful human life. Understanding and practicing the Heart Jewel develops our mind in a subtle but very profound way towards more happiness and freedom."
2,His weakest CD but his voice saves it,"On Love & Consequences, Gerald LeVert makes a few overtures to hip-hop, but he remains, in his heart, a sensitive loverman -- which is both a good and bad thing. LeVert is a powerful, soulful vocalist who can deliver love ballads as well as any of his contemporaries, but he doesn't always exhibit much musical imagination. ""No Sense"" may have cameos from rappers Layzie Bone and Ken Dawg, and ""That's the Way I Feel About You"" is a duet with Mary J. Blige, but they only illustrate that LeVert is from the old school and doesn't really have the desire to bring his music into the present. Which means, of course, that Love & Consequences isn't much different than any other LeVert album from the '90s -- it has a slight modern sheen, but it's a quiet storm album at its heart. It doesn't offer any surprises, but LeVert is a professional -- and that means there are enough solid songs here to make it enjoyable, but not quite enough to make the entire album memorable."
5,Love it!!,I absolutely love this Cd. In my opinion this Cd is the perfect blend of slow & uptempo songs. Mr. Levert had to be one of the most underrated artist out there. His songs and voice made you feel and believe in love. He will truly be missed.
3,It works.,"This is a perfectly useable t-square. I have had no problems with it at all. The only thing that can get a bit annoying is that the clear plastic edges don't go all the way down to the paper, theres a small gap underneath formed by the wood core of the t-square. It's not really an issue, it doesn't really impede performance, just something that needs to be watched when your using it. Other then that, it's a great tool!"
4,Beautiful photography; Well constructed basic overview.,"Contains information on lifestyle, structure, anatomy, senses, and snake locomotion. Most of the book provides a basic overview of several groups of snake (e.g. elapidae, boas, sunbeam snakes, vipers, etc.). Brief descriptions of each family are provided along with some specific details on a few individual species. The wonderful photos are included throughout the book. The ""did you know"" type boxes, found in each section, were of particular interest. This book neither intended as a species guide for snake identification nor for regional identification. However, it is well worth the price. Overall, well written & full of interesting facts + excellent photos."
3,His first film from a disabled film maker.,"Understanding that the film maker has autism, dystonia,and neurological stereotypy""s the equivalent of a grade school education and it took him 2 years to make, and every time he had an event he edited it out of the movie. Also the movie had no script and the story is shallow I do believe this is his best film, but do not expect much his brother Andrew helped him with many things he understood not and supported when possible it is more centered around a younger persons type of film. But it was good to see my son on film for an hour not have a seizure like event thankful for the small things in this life he is proud of this, and that is good enough for me."
4,Belushi?...by Woodward?...,"I read this book soon after it was published, mainly out of curiosity. Having come from the same town in Illinois, Woodward paints a fascinating and tragic portrait of the SNL funnyman. His rise and fall is the stuff of Hollywood legend and this book covers his childhood, professional life, relationships, and death by heroin overdose, despite the efforts of friends and loved ones to intervene. An interesting read."
3,A good read... but not the whole story,"I read 'Wired' at a time when I could relate to the fast lifestyle that John Belushi led and it helped me through it. On the flipside, however, Woodward seems to portray Belushi in a negative light when in fact he was one of the most talented comedians ever with a huge heart, only his obsession with drugs were his downward spiral. If you're interested in the life of Belushi, especially the dark side, definitely read this book. But if you want the whole story you're going to have to read 'Samurai Widow' by Judith Jacklin Belushi so that you may see his good side as well and see why so many people loved this man."
1,Toxic and biased.,"This book only shows the dark side of John Belushi. A good alternative to this book is SAMURAI WINDOW by John's widow, someone who actually KNEW Belushi, not a journalist such as Mr. Woodward. Woodward saw Belushi only as a get drunk do drugs sort of guy, but he had a very soft and tender side to him that only his true friends and family could tell about."
1,I didn't feel this book was well written.,"I thought John Belushi was an extremely talented performer. I read ""Samurai Widow"" and enjoyed it. I also read ""All the President's Men"" by Bob Woodward and thought it was very thought provoking. So I looked forward to ""Wired"". I was very disappointed, both at Mr. Woodward's choppy and chaotic style of writing, and at the very negative image it portrayed without showing any of Belushi's talent. I got about halfway through the book and decided that it wasn't worth finishing."
1,dont waste your money!,there is a reason why Judy and the Belushi family have shunned this author and this book. this is not a true reflection of what John is and as a lifelong fan of John (and James) I will not read this and I suggest you stay away. Read judys books about John those are the true reflection
1,Very disappointing,"Capucci, pour homme, one of my old favorites was a huge disappointment. The scent did not even resemble the original fragrance. I am not sure what is the reason for the difference may be, perhaps the brand name was sold to a discount perfumer."
3,Good book to understand the basics of Devotion,Good book to understand the basics of DevotionGood book to understand the basics of DevotionGood book to understand the basics of Devotion
3,not a recipe book,"This book is not a simple recipe book, but rather a book that goes into the origin of the clays and glaze materials. It is nicely detailed and gives the origin mineral/rock names of the rocks or the locations of origin.This is a nice book to have with details. It makes you want to go and get your own clay and rocks from nearby and grind and make your own natural ingredients.Some other good books: Out of the earth into the fire, The ceramic glaze handbook, High fire glazes."
4,Just what we were looking for....,This is exactly what we were looking for. We had an older model and wanted another for our twins. It disassembles easily for packing into a car. It is very durable and cleans easily. We use it indoors and outdoors. The entertainment table has nice animals but they did not easily interface with the child. You have to pull hard on the animals to make them do anything and it is so low and inconsistent that the child becomes bored with it. We usually remove it and use the table for Cheerios or other toys anyway.
3,Item is great on tiles but not on carpet,"This items works better if you have tiles in your home, majority of my house is carpet so its hard for my son to move around. He usually just stays in one place on carpet, but if he is on tiles he can move around more. The look is very nice. He likes the toys and the sounds that come with the walker. I purchased another one that was cheaper and works better."
3,Parts Missing,We were really excited to receive our product yesterday only to find out that there were parts missing. I called Graco and was advised that it will take them TWO weeks to ship the parts to us and there was NOTHING that they could to do to speed up delivery..
5,Great Walker!,"This walker is great. I bought it for my daughter when she was 8 months old, a little older than most people do, but she loved it. Once she got the hang of it she was scooting across the house super fast. Some of the other reviewers stated that it was hard for their babies to move on the carpet but she never had any problems, even going from carpet to lenoleum. The only thing I did not really care for was the tray of toys, she never really used it, and it did not really work that great. The stops worked great the were really sturdy and once locked in they did not move. Also I bought it because it did not fold down, I never trusted the style that folded so this one was perfect because it locks in at 3 leaves. I would definately recommend it to anyone."
4,"Walker is great, the toys really are lame","It's a good thing my daughter could care less about the toys, because it does not deter her from loving her walker. What it also doesn't deter her from, unfortunately, is getting her little hands on everything within reach! At least now we know what we have to baby-proof. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the ridiculous stuffed toys with unintelligible moans and metallic sounding words. I love this walker!"
5,My baby luv this walker,"This walker is amazing. you can remove the toy parts, and put a snack in it to feed your child if you'd like to. The quality is great,and you can change the music, sounds, and numbers to like 5 different selections. It can count to 5 in English and Spanish make animal sounds, and jungle type music. I simply Love it!!!!!P.SI had to learn how to change the sounds back and forth. To save you guys the trouble just press the arrow button opposite of the power button."
4,THE EAGLE,This movie is very much underated. Sword and Sandal movie lovers should grab a hold of this movie because it has a fantastic plot and reminds you of all those big spectacles of the 50's & 60's. If you ever read the novel called EAGLE OF THE NINTH you will see that the movie followed the book quite closely. Great entertainment.
2,Superficial,"I wanted to like this movie, but the main character Channing Tatum, seemed more like a dopey kid with a big neck than a Roman commander."
3,"Interesting, but I read the book first. Should have waited.","The Eagle was an ok movie but for me it was a let down simply because I read the book first. The first half of the movie followed the story, but after a while the story just shifted completely. I know they have to leave parts out because of time and they want to add more action, but it took the movie down a notch for me. No fault to Amazon since I grabbed the movie up without reading the reviews myself. Overall it is entertaining, but watch the movie before you read the book."
4,Good Movie,While have some will not like this movie because of historical inaccuracies it is a good movie. It has a good plot wuth a well rouded cast.
3,read the book,"Not bad.However, the movie seem to be based on Rosemary Sutliff's book""the lost eagle of the ninth""Everything being equal read the book"
4,One I know my movie group will enjoy,"This is a Roman epic which should appeal especially to those who enjoyed GLADIATOR and the like. The story is that of a Roman soldier and his Breton slave on a quest to find and return a golden eagle which disappeared with an entire legion of Roman soldiers. There's enough action here to satisfy action fans, but there's also a strong theme of bonding between to men who would ordinarily be enemies. The disc includes, as a bonus feature, an alternate ending which is well worth watching."
2,Pass,I didn't read the book... I thought this movie could have been better if they casted more credible actors. I hate watching movies or shows which are supposed to be during a certain time and the details are incorrect. Some reviewers compared this movie to Braveheart... that is unacceptable. The attention to detail and casting for Braveheart is not comparable to this film. I do not dislike any of the actors but I think this story would have made more sense if the actors at least spoke the dialogue of the time period they are attempting to portray. At one point during the movie a native american (sounding) score was played which reminded me of a cherokee chant.Also the angles were adjusted to excessively minimize the costs of production. It was no fun to watch since the camera tended to cut away when someone would get injured in the fighting scenes.
2,"Not faithful to the book, so don't expect much!","I read the book and two days later watched the movie, expecting to see how the movie dealt with the freeing of Esca and Marcus' friendship and treatment of him as an equal(it doesn't, and he's only freed at the end); how they would portray Marcus' friendship with the young girl, Cottia, which in the book almost came across as indecent due to the age discrepancy (she isn't in the movie, aside from possibly being in the crowd in the gladiator scenes); The tame wolf-cub (didn't see him); Marcus' deceit in acting as a Northerner and speaking their language (this is avoided); The burying of the Eagle (The 9th is reformed in the movie, which is silly.)Had I not read the book first, maybe I'd have given this 3 stars, but seeing how the story was changed for the worse in my opinion, I can only give it 2 stars."
3,Interesting Movie,I am a big fan of history movie... But it was all over a flippin gold object... But besides that I liked the movie...
2,savages..?!,"I enjoyed this movie to a point , but I hate the political points of it and most of all how scottish highland warriors and brits are basically primitive indians/savages WTF!!??. It really depends on who's view at the era, cmon!.romans were not jehovahs.they were as much merciless as any other people of the time period. quit this jewish propaganda of political correctness."
1,Channing Tatum?,"Is Hollywood serious? Couldn't they get a lot better actor than him? Someone like Orlando Bloom? HAHAHA.The previews was terrible. He is terrible. He needs to just pose for underwear print ads and leave the acting to people like Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, Jude Law, etc. etc."
4,Good action movie,"I have seen several movies around this setting .. this one fits in well. Have watched it twice now and enjoyed not only the action and story line but the character development. The alternate ending was interesting, too."
4,Interesting and Unusual,"Based somewhat on a true incident -- the strange disappearance of an entire Roman legion ""north of the wall"" in the wilds of ancient Scotland -- this film is entertaing and reeks of authenticity. The acting is very good and the use off actual locations greatly enhances the story-telling. I especially enjoyed hearing the Scottish-Gaelic language spoken in a number of sequences."
1,More like a bad fantasy novel,"I love Roman era films, but this movie was absolutely awful. The acting, especially from the main characters, was stiff and wooden, and I didn't buy most of the performances. Even Donald Sutherland comes off badly. And what the heck is up with the costumes? It's bizarre to me that they would go to the trouble of having the Picts speak actual Gaelic and then dress them up like Mohican Indians. With bones in their hair? Are you serious?! The costume designer should be shot for that alone. They may as well have made them orcs! Pass on this unless you are dying for a Roman action flick and have nothing better to do."
1,"Don't waste your time, read the book instead","I know a book has to be abridged for film, but they made some really bad choices here. Basically they took the book, ripped its guts out, and stuffed it full of cotton candy. And 'UNRATED?' This version clearly says PG-13. Don't waste your time, read the book instead, or watch 'Centurion.' And I was really looking forward to this . . ."
2,I kind of thought it stinked,"The movie was entirely devoid of any emotions - unless you can call missing an Eagle an emotion. People you don't know, and don't care about, are slaughtered regularly throughout the movie, which has a horrible soundtrack of endless sword clicking. The early Scotts are depicted as completely primitive and wearing Mohawk haircuts. I don't know if this is historically accurate or not.If one did not know what movie they were watching, the lack of skill of the production would not allow one to know if they were actually watching Scotts or Iroquois.I believe that Channing himself could have starred in a very good movie of this sort, unfortunately, this was not that movie."
2,OK enough,"I liked the setting of the film and the concept. I felt the script was a little cliche'd. They tried to make it a buddy movie, especially the last lines. I was most struck by the absence of any women. You know the Bechdel test -It includes two women, who have a conversation, about anything but a man. Not only couldn't it pass it, not a single woman has any lines of dialogue. None."
2,Channing Tatum CANT act!!!!,Jamie Bell does a great job. Rest of the cast too. Channing Tatum however was completely unbelievable and tried so hard to look macho and manly. He is still just the little A&F model who best fits in silly chick-flicks. The ending was such a let down and was completely rushed. This movie was not good at all.
4,Is Channing Tatum the New Brad Pitt?,"I'm always a little behind the popular culture curve, so I've never seen Channing Tatum on film before. For a guy who started out as an Abercrombie & Fitch model, he did a fine job in this movie. Some reviews here have called his acting ""wooden"", but Roman soldiers were manly stoics and he represents that sort of masculinity very well. Plus, his natural athleticism brings a lot to the role.Frankly, I'm glad the guy is around. Hollywood needs his type of leading man - there are only so many metrosexual actors one nation can stand.As for the film itself, it had its flat spots, but the screenplay was believable and the action sequences were satisfying. There was one long scene that had me chuckling - when the primitive Scottish Seal People warriors were performing their drunken coming-of-age dance ceremony, I couldn't help musing that it looked like a homoerotic modern British rave party, but with fewer tattoos."
5,Gladiatior+Lord of the Rings= Great Movie,A great epic movie that you shouldn't miss. It starts off epicly and never stops being epic. So go see a fun movie that you will enjoy if you saw Gladiator or Lord of the Rings.
1,Preview hell,"Despicable packaging, I don't even care if the movie is good or not because I'm just pissed about loosing all control over previews. You can't stop, pause, rewind, forward or skip the previews, of movies that I now dispise because of this tactic. Heck I might have even been interested in the movies being previewed but not anymore. I will be on the lookout for every such release and avoid them like the plague.On the spelling mistake I actually did use spell check but forgot it doesn't review words in all caps."
2,Bad,"I'm not articulate enough to really explain what is wrong with this movie besides the acting. First of all, the Romans were the bad guys. Why is this film putting you on the side of the bad guys? And why does the Celtic slave suddenly change his mind and decide to help the Roman? It was a completely spontaneous moment that made no sense. And why IS it noble for a slave to have loyalty to his keeper against his own people. Just stupid.Also, let's be clear. The Picts were not Native Americans. The inappropriate co-opting of Native American imagery to dress up the Picts was annoying. The mohawks and tomahawks were out of line. It was like Dances With Wolves against the Pawnee."
2,Great costumes and scenery,"But, wooden acting and unbelievable character motives. How does this happen, that most of the acting was bad to mediocre. Were they rushed through production, have problems on the set, not getting along, strung out on coke? In the first scene the actor playing the subordinate officer seemed to have just learned his lines or was reading them off camera.The main character acts like a less than intelligent protagonist and I found myself fast forwarding to get past the drawn out ..gee it's not hard to guess where this is going and how could he possibly believe that or think that...next scene.If you can watch the movie without thinking you may enjoy the realistic costumes and sets, the fantastic English country side. Maybe if you turn the sound off it won't seem so terribly hard to buy into. I have seen fantasy movies that were easier to believe in. Awful!"
1,Great movie - Digital Copy does not work,"Bought 3 movies for my train trip to NYC. Two digital copies worked fine but this one does not. When I contacted both Universal Digital Copy and Amazon there was ""nothing they could do""."
3,The Eagle,"Delivery was quick and faster then I thought it would take.The DVD was good, not great, but still entertainming. It's bit bloody in some parts and surprising perks to the story."
1,A clean shaven Roman north of Hadrian's Wall,"A fair attempt at re-creating life in Roman Britain circa 140 A.D.; however, the Roman empire was already by this time firmly in decline and disintegrating, being bankrupted by its zeal for putting garrisons everywhere in the known world. The most unbelievable segment of the movie has a clean-shaven and (obviously) Roman Aquila moving about Pictland north of Hadrian's Wall without being challenged! Anyone who was clean shaven would have been an obvious target to the natives, yet somehow the audience is expected to believe that clean shaven Romans are welcome everywhere! This and a plot focused on a gold-plated eagle figurine allows for only 1 star."
2,This Eagle has A BROKEN WING,"The GOODThe first 15 minutes are filled with exciting fighting scenes.The mountainous and river scenes look spectacular.The BADThe rest of the movie is so far-fetched that I lost my interest. For example, 2 guys tried to infiltrate a tribe to steal back the Eagle. Two guys tried to fend off the whole tribe with 2 swords. And yet, one of the guy had been honorably discharged from the army because of serious injury. At the end, they all survived. Yeah, right!In short, it has its moments but mostly it's bad."
2,Um....,The characters were not well formed. One scene they were fighting the next they were traveling. The characters had no substance. They had allot of close ups of Channing. Not a great movie. It's worth a rental but not to purchase. I'm sorry but this was not a good movie. I really don't recommend this one.
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"This is one of the best movies i have watched in years. My wife agrees. We both loved it. Great acting, great plot, great suspense, original story line, great costumes, great music and screenplay. No nudity, no dirty jokes or profanity. Just a great ROMAN EMPIRE ERA story. I delayed buying it because of the negative reviews. Boy, that was a mistake. Simply put, it was a great experience watching this movie."
3,Is the eagle worth it?,"Opening military action is good. The story about the high value of the Eagle does not impress. I didn't know the Roman army invented the ""Honorable Discharge."""
4,nice conclusion,"Final book in the Sword espionage trilogy, this one invoked more of a murder mystery feel than the other two.An interesting story, even if a few minor plot points weren't dealt with all that thoroughly - more of a ""oh by the way this is what happened"" at the end."
3,Enough Balance?,"Cannato aptly describes the social disintegration of New York City during the 1960s and early 1970s. The forces that changed New York, were also those that forever changed Newark, NJ, Washington, DC, Detroit, MI and many other major cities. What is lacking here is some perspective on how Mayor Lindsay's programs compared to programs in other cities. It seems to me that Cannato looks back at the Lindsay years through a Guiliani lens. That is patently unfair, can you imagine what the riots would have looked like in 1968 if a Diallo incident happened then? Especially since following the Diallo incident, Giuliani was notably quiet on the incident?John Lindsay deserves more credit than he is given here."
4,a big tale about a little known man that accomplished great things.,"Lindsay was first elected to office as the congressional representative of Manhattan's ""Silk Stocking"" district & was deemed unpopular. During a time entrenched corruption of the Democratic political machines & the NYPD, that still controlled large cities in the early postwar years. This dissatisfaction, along with Lindsay's reputation as a reformer, helped win him the mayoral election of 1965 and helped pave the way for Giuliani to ease into the role of conservative mayor.This book (728 pgs) sat on my bookshelf for years staring at me, begging to be read. I didn't realize that between Cannato's excellent writing style and the fact that it is much more about NYC politics and corruption than the mayor himself, I would not put it down for 72 hours. This is the quintessential Gracie Mansion version of Serpico. Lengthy, but well done, cover to cover."
2,A not so good purchase,"The Ibook's software is too old to fully enjoy Internet and my computer and did not live to my expectations. I cannot watch movies, cannot download anything. I only can connect to my email box, and listen to music. Connecting to Skype will only give me the old version of Skype."
1,Car Charger,"Quick delivery, but it worked only one time. Stopped after that. The cost of shipping was more than the charger, so I didn't send it back. I will buy the next one from a local store so I can bring it back without having to pay for it several times over."
1,terrible...not as advertised,"this thing did not fit my phone...it was advertised for it on here, but then when I got it, it was for a completely different phone. there was no point returning it and incurring the shipping costs so I just abandoned it in a box of unvaluables. Then I went to the AT&T store and bought a real one that fit."
2,Good design but poor quality,This OEM charger has a light and a pass through feature which are cool. The price is also very good too so it's supposed to be a no brainer. Sadly the prongs that attach to my w580i broke off and I can no longer use it. I agree with other users that it seems like this product is much easier to break than the adapters which came with the phone. Now I resent this poor design and the Sony engineers should have come up with a better adapter.
5,looking for chukars,"Excellent product, you can plug in your hands free device so you still have use of your phone while charging. Also has a small light on charger which is very helpful for night time use."
4,OEM Power Adapter,This power adapter works well with the Z750a. I found aftermarket adapters that cost more but had problems with them. This adapter is exactly what it says it is OEM! The pass through connector lets you connect other devices to the phone while it is plugged in. COOL! The LED light in end of the cord is great at night. Just slide the switch and you have light to see where the plug is. No more fumbling in the dark. Great unit to keep your phone charged while on the go.
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,"I have been using this charger for at least two years, for my Sony w580i. I was skeptical at first, because it was so inexpensive. It works great and I have even gotten some use out of the little light at the end of the charger."
3,had to replace it after 14 months,I had this charger for about 14 months. The connection to the phone is now loose enough to make it unusable. I think it is more an issue with Sony design than the charger itself.Looked at discount store for aftermarket charger and was 12.00. This one is less than 10 bucks with shipping so I am ordering it.All in all this is an ok charger.
4,Generic device - great feature,"This is just a car charger? Well maybe, but it came with one very nice feature. There is an LED on the plug that is easily used to see the power jack on the side of the phone. Easy to plug in - in the dark. One small negative, there was a clip on the side of the charger that I was never able to figure out its purpose and I broke it the first time I touched it. It doesn't have any effect its use as a charger and I would buy another one just for the LED."
3,Missing Essential Tracks,"There's a reason this cd costs less than $7. The most glaring omissions are ""You Should Be High Love"", ""Lonely is the Night"" & ""Learn How to Live"". Oh well, you get what you pay for. If you want the real ""best of"" compilation, get the REACH FOR THE SKY anthology."
3,Was a good song writer,"He was never a respected artist but, in hindsight, he was a very gifted songwriter. 20 years later, his songs still sound good and not antiquated. I think Billy Squire was an overlooked artist that never got his due. He would be a great act on the oldies circuit"
4,late 80's crusin Rock and Roll..,billy had his moments back in his glory days. i've great memories of some his stuff.it sounds a little dated like most 80s music does but when played every blue moon it's not bad.now adays it's when i play it it's fun to just sit back and remember. ahhhhhh those were the days. caireen where are you.
2,Where are the other songs?,"Billy Squier electrifies on Tell the Truth and touches us on Tale of the Tape. Where is Angry, You Should Be High Love, Rythm, and The Music's Alright. I want to see a complete set. Even the Anthology gives songs from these albums."
3,Not Bad,"I read this a while back, but quit about two thirds through. I was looking for something that got more into the mind set of people who do porn. This does, but to a fairly limited amount of people because it's primarily centered around a single movie so there's not a lot of interviews with many people all around the business. I mean it's interesing to hear what the camera man has to say or the director or th producer and of course the players, but with such a limited sample there's not enough depth. None the less it's not a bad read in general, but I lost interest because it wasn't what I was expecting..."
3,A moderate's view on race relations in the 90's,"A contrast to Cornel West's ""Race Matters,"" Loury takes a bold step into the middle of the intellectual arena. While refusing to spout purely conservative or progressive rhetoric, Loury puts forth compelling arguments for a shift from W.E.B DuBois' liberal ideals to a Booker Washington-like self-help gospel. A very thorough examination of the problems created by political correctness is also included. Overall, well written, but not going to change the world."
1,Still waiting for first issue,Bought it in January and still wiating for the first issue....4 months for a magazine? If I suscribe through them I get that months issue in a week.
5,AWESOME DEAL THROUGH AMAZON!!,"Amazon offered an awesome deal on this, which made getting the CD with the mag much more affordable.This was a gift for my boyfriend, but we definitely both enjoy it."
5,A joy to read,"I have read many Buddhist books, but this one is definately unique. It is hard to put down once you start. The author takes us through forests and hills to point how the Buddhist Dhamma is all around and can be realized if we only put forth the effort. This book really makes me want to further my own understanding of Buddhism on a personal level."
4,Good for Beginners But Low on Detail,"This is a good book for beginners. Identification is based on flower color, which is easy to follow but sometimes ambiguous (e.g., what Tekiela considers pink, I might consider purple). I was able to quickly and easily learn many plant species using this book.Now that I know am pretty knowledgeable of Minnesota flora, I don't use this book as much. He doesn't have all the wildflowers of Minnesota, and additional details I would like to learn about each species are missing.I recommend this book to beginners. It is much easier to use and less intimidating than the average botany book. More advanced botanists will be better off with something more detailed."
4,Wildflowers of Minnesota: Field Guide,This is a great guild for anyone looking to learn about the wildflowers they see growing in their backyard or on hikes in the woods and prairies. I also like the fact the author identifies which flowers are native and which are not. There are great color photo's associated with each flower which I love. I have never had much luck identifying plants with the black and white drawn images.
2,"Oh, come now","The number of four and five star reviews is disproportionate here. There's a reason that most Beck fans don't count this as one of his ""real"" albums. It doesn't even deserve the adjective ""experimental,"" since that would imply that this is some kind of serious effort. It isn't.I gave it two stars because two songs amused me. (Watch the video for ""Satan Gave Me a Taco"" on Youtube.)"
