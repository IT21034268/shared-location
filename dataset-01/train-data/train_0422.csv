3,I have to agree with Kirk McElhearn's review,I was a little disappointed to find that some of the songs that were not written by the dead but clearly made famous by them were not in the book. How can you not have song's like dark hollow in the book. Who is the original writer of that? I have no idea but the dead made that song. I feel it is one of there best and to not include that one and others was for me personally a bit of a let down.
3,Missing Songs,"This is definitely not the complete lyrics. It is missing ""Big River"" and ""Jack-a-Roe"". And those are the only songs I've noticed so far! I hate to speak negatively of something so closely related to the Grateful Dead but this book is not what I thought it would be.If you are looking for a COMPLETE book then look elsewhere.Good luck and positive {{{{vibrations}}}}"
5,Great Reference Book,"Any fan of the Grateful Dead needs this book. Although it may not have every Dead song in it (how can it, it'd be huge), it's comprehensive for 90% of their songs and provides lyrics when the notes aren't available.Again, if you're a Dead fan, get it."
5,Hey now!,"I love this book!Always had questions about some of the phrases and meanings and now have a perspective.Truth is I have my own connotations of the songs, but this book really covers so much more.A plus in any Deadhead's book collection. Highly recommended. Great illustrations as well."
5,Great book,This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Great stories and insights into the lyrics. Great gift for any deadhead.
2,They were on the right way..,Yes here are mostly boring songs but if these wouldn't have been done then there wouldn't have been done anything else later on either. This music is like a young flower plant before its bloom.
5,"Popeye-Patriotic Popeye, Private Eye Popeye,",We received this item on time in great condition. We would have preferred DVD unfortunately this item was only available in VHS. The VHS had well cared for as it was in great condition. Thank you
3,worth the money???,well you get what you pay for. they were well worth the money but beware the hammers will not take as much abuse as you would think a metal hammer would. but overall they were decent.
1,sad,"After two strikes with one of the hammers the head broke (popped, might be a more adequate description, don't think I've ever seen anything like it before) off. The interior of the casting looked more like it was made of very porous pot-metal. Maybe these will work well on play-doh? Did I miss something in the ad. Buyer beware. Great hammers just don't hit anything with them (or allow them to be hit?). Does ""Neiko"" translate to something like, ""NOT"" ? :-)"
3,Bad Case,"china tools ok for the small job i have, but the case was busted everywhere just trash shipped to me."
1,Poor quality and craftmanship,"Now I actually ordered this, didn't like the quality, and had a replacement sent. The second kit was just as bad. Like previous reviews, the case is not durable enough to handle the heaviness of the case, especially during shipment, so both cases were cracked on the interior. The surfaces of all the pieces were either rusted, tarnished, imperfect, pitted, etc so although this kit was cheap, you definitely get what you pay for. Now I understand why a quality hammer and dolly kit is so expensive. A kit not for me."
1,Junk from China,"Very poorly made. Don't waste your money. Heavy, bad balance. Castings are about as bad as it gets. Only wish I could get my money back."
2,John,"It got the job done the first time to use it again and one of the Hammers broke The Metal used for the hammers is not the best Quality, The price was right for what you get!!"
5,Nancy's car,"I happen to be reading this book right now, I am only into it about twenty pages, but it is already exciting! Nancy's car has been wrecked, she's got her mystery, and someone stole some money from and innocent little boy! Nancy's friends are already involved and soon they are going to leave on a trip to scotland! This is making me more excited, I am going to read it right now!"
2,"Yep, Crashes To Ground after 1 month.. mine broke in pieces, LOL!","I've used the locking interdesign products before, and they have all stayed up on smaller units when there was a firm lock (when they make those on a production line, some come out to have loose lockings when you install them... those usually are defective).This big guy worked good for about a month, and then wham! I didn't even have a lot of weight in it, but I suspect that these bigger models of this type of product are not good for putting up. The smaller ones with single suction locks seem to work better without ever falling off (as long as the lock was tight, and it wasn't one of those devective ones that was loose brand new).Take Care.. Stay away from this big guy.. go with the smaller ones, especially the hooks.. those work 8 out of 10."
2,It's great until it crashes.,"I agree with previous posters. I thought this thing was working great, until I was awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of the caddy crashing to the shower floor. It only lasted about a month. I have used it for about a year, just putting it back up when it fell and have never been able to get more than a month out of it. This last fall was it's last, as it busted in two.I have also had the same experience with the power lock hooks. I use them for mine and my son's towel, but they never hold for more than a couple of weeks before the towels and hooks fall to the floor.I'll be looking for something different this time. I don't have time to fiddle with these things every couple of weeks."
1,Waste of money,"I thought I'd give it a chance but I certainly regret it. When I first attached the basket to my shower wall, I thought the suction cups were very strong. Then it fell less than 10 minutes later. I haven't been able to get the thing to stick for more than 10 minutes. Now it just sits on the edge of my bathtub. Don't waste your money. Seriously, don't waste your money."
3,Almost perfect - until it's not,"I loved this basket. So much so that I went back and got a second for my other shower. Then one fell after about a month. And then the second. Worst thing was that the plastic that holds the suction cups snapped so it was thereafter useless. However I'm considering getting another and trying to stick in on with silicone glue. Should I throw good money after bad? Decisions, decisions...."
5,"Top Bond, top DVD","Not only is this easily the the best Bond since Connery's era it also shows how wrong the direction Wilson is taking with Brosnan's bond. We have not only Dalton really going for it here, but also great action sequences (barefoot skiing, tanker chase) and a good hard-edged Flemingesk storyline. Even the DVD is great. Remastered 5.1 sound, anamorphic picture, 2 commentaries - a 'full' special edition. OO7 fans miss at your peril!"
5,An excellent OO7 film,"Though not the best James Bond film, License to Kill is certainly an excellent one. The acting is great with terrific performances from Timothy Dalton, Robert Davi, and Cary Lowell. The action is INCREDIBLE, including a midair brawl over an out-of-control airplane, an exciting underwater chase, an explosive climax in the Mexican desert involving oil trucks, and a gunfight at a drug plant. The plot is okay but the scenery is fantastic as are the song and score. Overall, my #6 OO7 film, beaten by The Spy who Loved Me, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger."
4,A great Bond movie! On second viewing its a lot better!,"A lot of people think this Bond outing is far too violent and a lot different than the others. And this is true. The PG-13 violence is uneccisary and it plays a lot different than a regular Bond movie. But if you don't really like it the first time give it another shot and you may find you like it. The plot centers around Bond's best buddy Felix Leiter who was maimed and his wife killed because Leiter and Bond helped capture a huge columbian drug lord, Franz Sanchez. Bond sets out to get back at Sanchez. His licence to kill is revoked and he sets out to kill Sanchez. Buying this DVD was a risk but i'm gald I did. Lots of fun. Dalton is great as Bond. He should have done more than 2 but he wasn't to popular. This Bond film marks several firsts in the franchise. Including 007's first PG-13 rating for violence and profanity. Q's extra large role is the best part of this one."
2,The Bond Era Has Come To An End,I started watching this movie on TNT one night and just about got sick! I love Bond movies (especially with Sean Connery) but now that they got this new guy Timothy Dalton the Bond movies are taking a downfall. This movie is just a bunch stunts and gun battles. Dalton is no where near as charming as the other Bonds were portrayed. It reminds me of MI2 which just came out. Gruesome and badly made. I'm sick of these new movies and wish they would just stop making them. They're an insult to well-made older movies. I can't believe I'm saying this but the movies made in the '60's and '70's are better!
2,"Not Dark, Just Drab","One of the bottom-rung Bond films. Dalton wasn't necessarily a bad Bond - ""The Living Daylights,"" his first flick, was fairly solid - but here he's let down by a dull, derivative script that lacks spark and flair. The look of the film is also drab - the colors, the scenery, the cinematography: it all has the workmanlike look and feel of a middling 80s television show rather than a well-financed entry in a traditionally polished feature film franchise. Add to that the fact that Daltons 007 era had one of the weaker supporting casts (the actors playing M and Moneypenny barely register here, and the villains and Bond women simply bore), and you don't exactly have a recipe for success. Basically, this film is only for Bond diehards - and even they may wince."
2,Low point in the series,"A lifelong Bond fan, I've watched this movie only once since it first came out. I eagerly went to see it when it opened in 1989, hoping it would be a solid follow-up to The Living Daylights, an engaging yarn featuring a largely-unknown but impressive, intense (and unfairly maligned) actor named Timothy Dalton. But LTC proved a disappointment. It was unexpectedly violent and dark (though that didn't hurt the excellent Casino Royale), had that weird silver/gray palette of the 80s, and included a number of elements that can best be described as cheesy, e.g. the gray morning coats and Ascot ties of the opening scene, several unfunny efforts at humor, Robert Davi's over-the-top villain, Dalton's hairstyle, and ... Wayne Newton?? Compared to its predecessor, LTC was an even bigger disappointment than Quantum of Solace (2008). This was a terrible waste of a decent actor (Dalton), who could have been the Daniel Craig of the franchise 20 years ago."
5,"""Simply Exciting""","1989's ""Licence To Kill"" would mark the final time a Bond film would be made in nearly six years due to legal issues. Unfortunately, it also marked the final time Timothy Dalton would play James Bond. Giving the role his own turn with style, sexiness, and elegance, Timothy never had the chance to grow with the role like other actors, and I have always felt he would still be playing Bond now while in his sixties.The plot of ""Licence To Kill"" deals with Bond chasing after a powerful drug lord who killed some of Bond's closest friends. Much of the beautiful scenery took place in Mexico City and the Florida Keys, and those location shoots would become characters of their own in this film as the producers wisely made the choice, like in other Bond movies, to use extraordinary scenery to enhance the story.""Licence To Kill"", however, became a box office disappointment in the U.S., but became huge overseas ultimately bringing in over $150,000,000."
2,Crumby bond filck,"This is by far the worst James Bond film ever released. The script is so cheesy. Timothy Dalton's performance is rotten at best. James Bond has his licence to kill revoked but that doesn't stop him. There's a shark in this. How many Bond films have sharks? The gambling scene was what makes James Bond, James Bond. It was written by two screenwriters. One writer captured bond well but the other didn't seem to know what he was doing. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're a major Bond fan and you want to complete your collection. Other than completing your collection there's no other reason to have this film."
1,Worst Bond by a Landslide,"I grew up on the Bond series, reading many of the books and short stories written by Ian Fleming. I viewed my first Bond movie when I was six years old and have been an avid fan ever since. Until this movie was released. ""Lisence to Kill"" is by far the worst James Bond movie ever made, acting wise. The plot is ok, but the fact that Bond is so dedicated to queen and country makes this story about a personal vendetta for a man that he barely knows is utterly unbelievable. But that is ok. Its not like ""Moonraker"" or ""You Only Live Twice"" were believable, but the acting was ok. The acting in ""Lisence to Kill"" is the worst I have seen by far in a Bond film. Timothy Dalton's acting really isn't too bad, but it is not his best performance and his surrounding cast is absolutely horrid! I would not recommend that anyone purchace this film unless you want to complete the set, which is what I did."
1,Bond the way it was meant to be,After getting this DVD and watching it again I can only say Dalton should did more Bond movies. The two he did were by far the best of the series. It seems that in every other Bond movie he's saving the world That also makes daltons movies different A great plot with great action. Bond was back shame he didn't stay.
2,the worst Bond film EVER!,After reading the reviews on here i went and rented this movie license to kill with high hopes and expectations. Needless to say that i was let down.This Bond movie is about one of James Bonds best friends get put in the hospital while his wife is killed. So James goes on a revenge rampage defying M and MI-6 to do so.I thought that it sounded cool but it was a drag. It started out GREAT with a lot of action and a solid plot. But as the movie progressed it got REALLY slow. And the end is so fake and hookey that it comes off as comical. This is the worst Bond film of all time! It isnt worth even your time.Now dont get me wrong i LOVE the James Bond series. And no-one can even come close to remotly compare with Shawn Conry! He is the only TRUE Bond! But the other Bond movies are all good. In fact this is the only Bond movie that ive seen that i didnt like. Just dont even bother wasting your time.
1,"If it ain`t broken,don`t fix it...............",This is the worst of all the Bond-films.Even Moonraker is better than this one.Look at it and make your ownb opinion
2,"Nice action scenes and villain, but wrong for a Bond film","Violent and hateful, I was appaled by this Bond movie. Bond has always been in many regards, cold (I still remember Connery coldly shooting that guy in Dr. No) but he has never been this hateful! Violent and unappealing! Wayne Newton was fun, though, offering the only light moments. ""Bless your heart!"""
2,DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST BOND FLICK,"i had the feeling i was seeing a made for USA cable flick instead of a real 007 adventure. the dialogue seems straight out of a tv movie. timothy dalton was way too damn serious as 007. the stunts and special fx are fine especially the opening sequence w/ Bond ""fishing"" for the villain's jet in mid-air. but those blue wedding suits! ugh! talisa soto=worst bond babe ever! carey lowell an ok bond babe. worst theme song by gladys knight. i'll stick with THUNDERBALL, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, OCTOPUSSY & THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH."
3,"Dalton is dull, but still the last good Bond film","Licence To Kill is a more adult story than many fans were used to when it came out. This film, along with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, had parts in it where Bond actually became a real person. He had emotions, and his quest for revenge is because of his love for his friend. The weakest link has to be Dalton though. He had no personality. He played the Ian Fleming Bond well, but even Ian's Bond needs a little humor or charm. Still, it does have one of the most romantic endings of the series. Cary Lowell makes one of my favorite Bond girls. "" If you ask me to "" has to be the best song to appear on the end credits of a Bond film. Watch for the classic action sequence involving Bond pursuing Sanchez in a Semi-Truck. Unfortunately, the series has only gotten worse after this film. Brosnan has even less of a personality than Dalton. The new Bond films are over blown nonsense, and follow cliched formulas."
1,The worst Bond film,"This is a nasty, ugly film lacking the wit, style and memorable action of the best of the series. The villains are graceless and sweaty; the music is rubbish; the locations are limited and unglamourous; the women are far from memorable beauties; and Dalton looks as if he's severely constipated throughout. Avoid."
3,Different pace for Dalton's Bond...,"This surprisingly violent entry in the James Bond saga almost marked the end for 007. It begins with Bond and Felix Leiter taking out Sanchez, a drug dealer, and making it just in time for Felix's wedding. However, Sanchez gets revenge and feeds Felix to a shark and murders his wife. Angry, Bond sets out to avenge his best friend, going against orders from M and losing his license to kill. It's not very cheery and has very few comic moments. The film's biggest problem is that it wants to be taken seriously. Bond movies almost never work when they try to be serious about their situations and this movie proves this point. There are a few moments, like an extended chase scene with semis and off-road vehicles, but much of the movie is too violent to really have that Bond feel. It's a shame Timothy Dalton took a bow after this one. I'm sure his third outing would have been better."
5,As Fleming intended,"Dark, brooding and sharp. This is the chararcter Ian Fleming wrote about, yet when Roger Moore came on the scene, Bond became a cartoon hero with undeniably good hair. Is this better than the Living Daylights? Yes and no.Plus points: Dalton first rate, probably the best action scene (truck chase), witty script and a decent villain. Negative points : poor choice of location(s) and drab girls. I love the bit where Dalton says ""Don't you want to know why?"" Mint!It's great to see Bond become more of a free agent. Enjoy!"
3,GOOD FILM BUT WHERE DID THE BOND PRODUCTION VALUES GO ?,Some good moments in this film but the production really looks cheap. I hate talkin that way about a film shot in my country but it really seems like someone was trying to save money. I would have recommendeded instead not making this mediocre film at all !
4,Dalton does Bond darkly,"Although a lot of people disliked Dalton as a more action oriented darker James Bond I feel that the two films he did in these series still hold up well. Free of unnecessary gadgets and puns that Roger Moore iniated, this film holds up much better than""Octopussy"" or ""Moonraker"" (the worst Bond film ever!!). Had Dalton continued as Bond, I'm sure he would bring just as much grit and touchness as the current Bond who I also like--Daniel Craig."
5,gift for my son,My son was very excited to receive this DVD for Christmas. He loves all of the 007 movies.
4,Licence to Kill!,one of timothy dalton's better efforts and the missing movie from my now complete Bond collection.
5,Underrated,"Timothy Dalton is often forgotten amongst the Bond-men...But he was my favorite and did a great job as the character. Also, the DVD features 2 of the best Bond songs--License to Kill by Gladys Knight and If you asked me to by Patti Labelle. Check it out!"
5,Dalton's swan song and a hard mean Bond film,"Some people really dislike this movie. Personally, I love it. It is a hard-edged and mean James Bond film that exhibit's Dalton's acting chops to the hilt. ""You earned it, you keep it, old buddy,"" Dalton says as he throws the 2 mill in the suitcase into McGill and sends him into the tank with a great white shark. He's out for revenge and nothing and no one can stop him -- even when his action inadvertantly upside other secret operations (the Hong Kong narcotics people, the CIA trying to get the Stinger missiles). When Bond lets Bruce McGill fall into the Great White shark tank after he tries to bribe him, ""You earned it, you keep it, 'Old buddy'."" The failure this film was it came out the same summer as BATMAN, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and LETHAL WEAPON 2."
4,Too serious and in depth for James Bond.,"Tinothy Dalton's second (and last) James Bond adventure is very dull. Timothy Dalton played it a little too seriously for this one, he was also sort of wooden in that he never showed any sign of emotion. This movie had a very in depth plot with James Bond resigning from the British Secrect Service just so he can investingate a friends' ploblem. Then James Bond runs off on a wild goose chase over most of central america to track the perpatrator who was also a drug dealer. There was not much action also. The climax in the Mexican desert was the only good part (I won't say anything else, you'll just have to see the movie:)."
1,Worst Bond Movie Ever,"This has to be the worst Bond movie I've ever seen. On paper, you'd think it be the best; a realistic plot for a change and original ending. However, this is the worst Bond movie ever. First off, it is very poorly executed. Second, it drags out for what seems like forever. Finally, I don't think this movie was put out with any effort. It was kind of like the director rolled out of bed two years from the last Bond movie and said 'Okay, time for another Bond movie'. It just doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
1,All I mean.............,"This film is just not Bond.He is suddenly some Bronson-type who always kills in cold blood.Many f the actors are good,but the villain is just all to everyday and Talisa Soto is a joke when it comes to acting.The producers also were foolish enough to place this film in South America.Horrible!Instead of something ecxotic we get this.File and forget it."
1,License Suspended,"This has to be one of the worst, if not the worst, film in the Bond series. Although Dalton never seemed to fit into the Bond role, the fault in this film is entirely with the script and the director. With this film it seems as if the Bond franchise finally ran out of good stories to write.Although the story of revenge against a fellow agent's murderer is good, the antagonist being a drug lord just drags the movie down. Moore's ""Live and Let Die"" was a similar problem. The villains in those movies just don't seem to be on the level of SPECTER and Blofeld, a Stromberg, Goldfinger, or Drax; they are, after all, just measely drug dealers.I saw this film only once and don't regret not having seen it again. An altogether very forgettable movie that isn't even worth renting."
4,beginning,"I absouloutly love this movie. I have seen every single james bond movie. The beginning scene is especially good. When 3 Agents parachute down into in an excercise. If the agents get hit by a bullet from a paintball gun they are ""dead"". But two agents are murdered. The one that wasn't murdered was james Bond who then has a thrilling ride on a truck. I love this movie."
3,A lesser favorite,"While I like all Bond films quite a lot, this has to be my least favorite, mostly because Bond is one a personal vendetta rather than on assignment as in all the other films. While the quality is otherwise up to the usual Bond standards, somehow this fact taints this movie for me."
4,Livin' La Vida Bond,"This movie is terrific. It has nonstop action, a villain who doesn't want the world, only money, and two hot Bond girls. In Bond 16, Timothy Dalton takes on the role of 007, who I believe was very underrated as the superspy. Many people put this movie down because it is serious, or Bond isn't working for MI6, but I say change can be good, and in GoldenEye, things go back to the way they were. The story is about how Bond is chasing a Latin American drug lord who maimed his best friend and killed this guy's wife. He quits his job and becomes a rogue agent. But this doesn't prevent the use of cool gadgets because Q follows him and supplies him with a new arsenal of equipment. This movie does have minor flaws. One of which is that the story can be a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll understand. If you haven't seen this one yet, put it on your to-do list."
2,Not one of the best.,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't sure what it was that I didn't like about it. Now that I've seen it a few more times, I think I have it. The problem with this flick is that it isn't really a James Bond movie. Gone are the exotic locals, the world domination plot and even the supercool spy himself. Dalton seems more like a cop than a spy in this film. Same for the premise. Bond's friend dies, so he gets personal. What is that? Bond would never get personal. I think the ""Cop Flick"" trend of the 1980's got to the writers."
3,We gave her a nice...honeymoooooooooon!,"Licence To Kill is one of those Bond films that grows on you. It cribs liberally from Fleming, which is a good thing because Fleming could be one sick puppy when he wanted to. The shark scene BTW is taken verbatim from the novel ""Live and Let Die"". Also note the name of that boat and its captain. They're both from the short story, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". Well, audiences in 1989 were not expecting the dramatic return of the literary Bond, which Dalton tried his damndest to capture. But it's not a bad film. The pace is quick and there is more character development than in all the Moore years combined. The girls are hot, there are gadgets and Robert Davi as Sanchez is, well, he's great but I wish he was more than just a drug dealer. I mean, how do we go from guys who want to blow up the earth to honest, hard working cocaine dealers? Watch out for a young Benicio Del Toro as one of Sanchez' henchmen."
5,Licence to Kill is the high point of the James Bond series.,"There is no doubt, the classic James Bond series are the best.Licence to Kill is the hight point of the series. Connery films laid the foundation, Lazenby and Moore films moved it along, and Dalton's clearly showed us how it would have looked like once the "" ever tightening coil has finally sprung"". That is, when he eventually got fed up with his job and went alone to fight a personal war.What is Dalton-Bond style? I say, it is Connery elegance with less flirting, and with much more expressive eyes. He can order you around with a look. Controlled anger. And always that threat of violence if he gets pushed too far. Like a volcano, composed but everybody knows its capacity for destruction.Dalton was a successful James Bond. His portrayal was supposedly the closest to the actual novels.He made his own distinct mark. Why, he even did a number of his stunts. On the Bond tree is carved .... ""Tim was here!""."
3,"Licence to kill? Yes, licence to thrill? Well...","Timothy Dalton's second outing as James Bond feels like an expensive T.V pilot rather than a Bond movie, and the unnecessary excess of violence makes it an uneasy entry into the long-running franchise.The locales, action and gadgets all feel somewhat second-rate compared to the extravagant The Living Daylights (1987), and said action feels laboured and un-involving. That said, it does have good points, there are some good action set-pieces and Dalton is great as Bond, but this one strays too far from the fantastical Bond films fans like and over into a violent world of overkill."
5,Great movie,I bought this for my brother because he is collecting all of the James Bond DVD's. He had never seen this one. He loved it.
5,james bond,i love collecting the james bond movies and watching them during the winter when there is nothing on tv .
3,"This Movie Is Great, But...","This movie has tons of great action, great bad guy, great story, and a great girl. The only problem is Timothy Dalton, he just doesn't do anything for me. He does not semm like James Bond. Also, this movie doesn't feel like a James Bond Movie. It's very dark, James Bond isn't working for the British Secret Service (he goes vigilante to avenge someone's death), and Dalton ... as Bond! All in all, this is a great action movie, but it's not very bondish, if you know what I mean, and that's why I only gave it 3 stars."
1,"Revoke this ""License""","Whew, what a bore. LICENSE TO KILL could have killed the James Bond series! Maybe all the cigarette smoking (a tobacco company paid to have its product prominently displayed) clouded the filmmakers' judgement. Were it not for a funny, unctuous villain wonderfully played by singer Wayne Newton, I would have walked on on LICENSE TO KILL. Don't pay a cent to see LICENSE TO KILL. But if you can catch it on TV, suffer through it just for Wayne Newton's part."
3,Bond goes into the action world,Okay I know that this is Dalton's last entry but it didn't feel like a bond movie it felt like a action movie. I thought this movie was going to be better then the living daylights but I thought wrong the living daylights is better than this film because this movie doesn't feel like 007. We have this flim on DVD and its kind of boring and its too dark because of the part when 007 was fighting at the barrelhead bar now that fight didn't look or feel like a true bond flick. If you want a true 007 flick don't waste your money on this get the living daylights.
1,Licence to Kill,"I thought that this was one of the worst bond films I have seen in a long time. I loved the movies Moonraker and Dr, No and I like every bond but i haven't seen any bonds with Timothy Dalton. So i Thought i would rent this one to see how he would be as bond. He is not bad at all. I even like him better than Perce Brosnan. I just thought the movie was bad. I dont know why i just do. I will just have to see if the living daylights is the same."
1,TIMOTHY DALTON IS NOT JAMES BOND!,This guy just does not work for this part! He makes a movie that could be sort of good into a absolutely terrible film.I am glad he only lasted for 2 movies before the next bond came along.
3,BETTER EARLY BOND,"This is one of the few earlier Bond films that still flow i.e. story, action thats not totally over the top, and the people are interesting. Good print."
5,Good Bond,"I wouldn't say this is the best Bond Movie. But I do like Dalton as James Bond, Dalton should have done more then only 2 bonds already Pierce has 3. Sean did a lot as bond and he was great. Rodger Moore as Bond? I just didn't like him he seemed to old for James Bond I'm glad they gave 007 some youth with Dalton and Pierce. I recomend this to any 007 fans"
4,"A ""companion piece"" to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""","Dalton, in my opinion, was the screen's worst ""Bond."" His obvious theater training makes him appear too inhibited for the role of the world's greatest lothario with a gun. That is not to denigrate his talent; it's just that he seemed ill-suited to fill the role.That said, however, I feel that this film is a fitting ""sequel"" of sorts to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Comparisons are easy to discern: 1) Both have actors whose run as 007 was limited; (2) the story lines reveal a little more personal side of the British super spy; (3) the actor's respective interpretations of the character are somewhat closer in tone to Sir Ian's creation.On its own merits, ""Licence"" falls a little flat, but when paired with the Lazenby film, it is an acceptable entry in the Bond series."
4,BOND WITH SOME GRIT,"Bond movies, for the most part, follow a pretty set pattern that has been proven through the years to promise successful box-office. This one has a little more moxy than most. The women are more involved in the action, the villan is more ruthless, his side-kicks more violent and the stunts are truely amazing. This is not to say there isn't it's share of moments when you just have to let out an ""oh plu-eeze!"" But I found this one more grounded in reality than others. All in all; a pretty good movie."
4,"Great album, but where's Boomerang?","This is, without a doubt, the ultimate compilation of ABBA's wonderful music. All of the hits are here, including Waterloo, The Winner Takes it All, Take a Chance On Me, and Dancing Queen. Which brings me to my one complaint about the album; my all-time favorite ABBA song, Boomerang, is nowhere to be found, even on the updated Forever Gold 2-disc cd! So, if you're an ABBA fan, get this cd and enjoy the great sounds of ABBA's finest. Then grieve at the criminally negligent omission of what is, in my opinion, ABBA's greatest song."
5,70s and 80s Cheese--Nostalgiac and Fun,"Okay, so maybe you're not wont to admit you ever listened to ABBA, let alone bought their albums. And nowadays, playing this album while you're alone at home...maybe the neighbors will have questions. Who cares? You love all this stuff and you know it. It's fun to dance to, albeit mindless, and worth rehashing for the next generation--so they understand the myriad references ABBA is getting in retro movies these days (cf. _Priscilla, Queen of the Desert_, etc.)."
5,Across all generations,"My daughter loves ABBA and begged me to get this album. She is still 11, who initially learned about the band from her grandmother. There aren't too many bands that are so timeless."
4,Better Now than Then,"I recently went to see Mamma Mia on Broadway. The thin and contrived plot is nothing more than an excuse to sing about 30 Abba songs -- as if an excuse were needed. Still, the musical did remind me again that beyond the buoyant pop sounds always instantly identifiable with Abba, the group -- even as relationships were falling apart -- had some insightful things to say lyrically about relationships and the pain of their end even as that end is inevitable. So, all these years after the group imploded, it's clear to me at least that Abba was more than bubble gum. And they are always welcome to make the occasional shuffle visit to my music player."
2,There are hits but not the sense of the original music.,"I find this ""re-engineered"" version of Abba's music very disappointing. It reminds me the the new fad of making other artists former hits ""With a Disco Beat"". Sort of like a disco version of a ""Switched on Beethoven"". Because to the ""consistent beat"", the new (1993) version is extremely boring and in no way reproduces the musical excitement of the real ABBA from the 70s and 80s."
4,Golden,"This is a great album except the tearjerker ""Fernando."" Otherwise it's great for any pop/ABBA fan. I guarentee you'll love it."
3,Sound quality could be better. But great compilation.,Sound quality could be better. Sort of flat. But the songs are all of ABBA's best and a few more. If your sound system has bass you should be okay.
2,AAAAH IT'S OK ONLY ONE SONG I REALY LIKE BUT CLEAR CD !,IF YOU LIKE ALL ABBA'S SONG GO FOR IT.. ! IF NOT WELL THAT'S UP TOO YOU ?TRY GETING JUST THE.. ONE SONG OR SONG'S.. YOU WANT ON.. A DISCO VARIOUS CD AND GET MORE SONGS FOR THE BUCK BEST WAY TO COLLECT AND KEEP SOME DOE !
2,very average,aside from Dancing Queen&Fernando there wasn't much to ABBA.formula Production&Music.catchy but forgettable for the most part.
1,oh come on already!!!!,"first there was abba gold... then gold volume 2... then the box set... then the 20th century master cd... then the ""definitive collection""... not to mention an array of other hits compilations...now abba gold again!... come on, people... how many remastered versions of ""dancing queen"" does the world really need? and can the average listener even HEAR the differences? it's just another example of corporate greed recycling the same hits over and over from a band (yes, a good one) which has been broken up for almost 3 decades???"
2,Thank God It's Over,I for one am glad that the 70's are over and even more estatic that bands like Abba no longer exist.......Why the 2 stars instead of a one? I feel sorry for them--I mean they were sincere---they just stunk.....
1,What is this sacrilege?,"Who do this abba think they are? Why are they copying the greatest group in the world - STEPS? They have no need to think that all Steps fans will rush our and buy this, oh, no. How dare they! This is just another teenie group jumping on the Steps bandwagon and hoping to become successes in someone else's right! What a bloomin' cheek! I bet Lynda la Hughes from Cheetham Hill will think they are the best thing since drippin'! Well, she's wrong. Steps are!"
1,Must...Destroy...ABBA...BLEARGH!,"Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!!"
3,Quality of sound,"The song selections on this CD are great. HOWEVER, the quality of the sound is poor."
4,MURIEL'S WEDDING ME ANIMO A COMPRAR EL CD,CUANDO VI LA PELICULA DE LA BODA DE MURIEL YO SOLAMENTE CONOCIA 2 CANCIONES DE ABBA( CHIQUITITA Y DANCING QUEEN)PERO EN EL SOUNDTRACK DE LA PELICULA ESCUCHE CANCIONES DE ELLOS QUE YO YA HABIA OIDO PERO QUE YO NO SABIA QUE ERAN ELLOS LOS QUE LAS CANTABAN; ENTONCES FUE CUANDO DECIDI COMPRAR EL COMPACT DISC(ABBA GOLD). YA ME APRENDI LAS 19 CANCIONES DE MEMORIA.
4,but it's missing one song,"Of course ABBA's fabulous. I've known that since an oh-so perky Denise C perked into Mrs. Patton's high school algebra class singing Dancing Queen.But the only song this CD lacks is ""I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do,"" the camp pean to the 50s. They put ""I DO 5"" on the SECOND ABBA gold CD. Pity."
5,Clean and happy,I think of when I was younger and my brother used to listen to Abba. It takes me back when I listen to them. Great album.
5,What a great collection,"This album reminds me of my childhood, great memories! If you want a great flashback, this is the album to get! (Isn't it funny, that now that we buy them digitally, we still call them albums, even kids that came along LONG after they stopped making albums, lol.)"
5,Abba Gold,"I really like Abba's happy music and I loved the movie ""Mama Mia"" so for 99 cents I couldn't pass up this album! Thanks Amazon for the Christmas Day specials!"
4,One song is missing! Only one!,"I own this wonderful collection. ABBA are one of my favorite groups.But why did they leave out ""I do, I do, I do""? It would have made aneven twenty songs on the CD."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,PREMIER POP MUSIC AT ITS PEAK. CRITICS ARE SOMETIMES WITHOUT A CLUE. THEY WERE WITH THIS BAND. 19(!) GREAT SONGS ON ONE CD.
5,ABBA Gold,Amazing ABBA collection for anyone who has wanted their greatest hits. I bought the CD for less than a dollar.
3,Questions,"The product was what I ordered, but I think may have some damage. It ""repeats or hangs up"" using the house CD player and the Car DC player"
5,Movies can influence you,"I bought this because of Muriel's wedding and I loved this record ever since. The movie was great and so is ABBA's music: Dancing Queen,Waterloo,Money,Money,Money,Take a chance on me,Mama Mia and many others. Just in case you buy it at least start at those tracks first."
3,Recorded too bright,"The selection of songs is good but the recording is too ""bright"" - sounds ok in the car but in a big room it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can."
3,"If you liked ABBA, you love this album","I didn't know ABBA, but then i heard Dancing Queen, and i rememberd. I was rebuilding my CD Collection and decided, i should check this out, i know the name. Well, it was the Disco Era and i happen to like somethings of that era, though i found myself skipping tracks when i mp3'd it. It got on my nerves after sometime. Yeah ABBA was big, but it seems to me (personal taste) it isn't something you listen to over and over. but to each thier own!"
3,"Sometimes, the original is NOT better","I purchased the CD after seeing the movie ""Mama MIa"". While I enjoyed the CD, I feel that the vocalists have very little energy - they almost sound bored. I feel that the songs were song in the movie with so much more enthusiasm - even if they voices themselves might not have been stellar.I will probably purchase the movie soundtrack for that reason I love the songs and the movie - they are still going thru my head"
5,Pure Pop Brilliance,"I had recently seen Mamma Mia! and thought back to my bubble gum music days and Abba, so bought the CD since I never owned it myself.Putting this on bought back all the memories of listening to the pop when I was growing up in my parent's collection. Was not like some of the ""cool"" music I listened to, but the songs always made me smile.The music is a guilty pleasure, but is also well crafted songs done well for what the group was producing. The fact that a movie and play was made from music that is over 25 years old shows that Abba was more than one-hit wonder that would be forgotten."
4,Abba,"This is my second CD from Abba, the reason I have two is because my girfriend loved it!so, I have to give it to her as a present. It's just something that will take you back to the 70's and you'll enjoy it again and again. Just the greatest hits! Period!"
4,Lots of memories,Good Musiclong time since I listened to Abba. several songs I really don't remember hearing before and I really like them alot.besides a whole album for 99cents is way to much of a bargain for me to pass up.
5,I'm a kid again!!!!!!!!!,"I can smell the grass, and long to bounce the ball again; ABBA makes me want to go outside and PLAY!!!Just wonderful, joyful music. Thanks to whoever for bringing those wonderful memories back."
5,Savvy shopper.,"I love this CD. I know that others commented on the sound quality, but to my ears it was pure heaven. Takes me back to a much simplier time."
3,Gold tunes from a fun group...,Great dancing/workout tunes for me and certainly takes me back to great times from my youth. Dancing Queen is a classic!
4,Songs that never get old,"I've been listening to ABBA ever since I was a teenager. I am 47 now and I still love all of their songs. Brings back so many wonderful memories. It is so great to have all these songs in one single collection. When I saw the price, I jumped at it."
5,So glad to find this as MP3 Downloads!,"WOW - this is one of those albums with all the music you grew up listening to and then forgot as the years went by. Most of the ABBA songs are lighthearted, fun, upbeat and still suitable for dancing around the living room with!"
4,ABBA Gold vs Mamma Mia,After seeing Mamma Mia in Las Vegas I purchased the ABBA Mamma Mia CD. Then I thought I would like to have the original songs and ordered the ABBA-Gold Greatest Hits. I enjoy it a lot; but I prefer the Mamma Mia CD which takes me back to the fun night of actually being in Las Vegas and seeing the musical.
1,Poor Sound Quality,Sound quality of this CD is not up to par. I am not impressed at all with the quality of it's sound. Very annoying. Save your money.
2,Mildly satisfied,"I'm not sure the songs are sung by the original AABA group, but the music sounds good."
3,Warmed over soup,Doesn't excite like it did when new. Overall a good recording of all the hits. I doubt if it will have much repeat play.
5,Abba........They are truly Gold!,"I believe that there is a new genertaion of ABBA fans emerging, I'm on of them, I'm only 18, the reason for this new generation of fans is simply the timeles quality of ABBA's music especially their music on the Gold album. I can still remember the first time I heard ""Dancing Queen"". The song had a tremendous effect on me. I feel that song is their best one. ""The Winner Takes It All"" is a break up song but the thing that make the lyrics so poignant is that this was actually happening to ABBA and they sang about it! ""SOS"", ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"", ""Voulez Vous"", are some of the great dance songs of ABBA. The CD is just awesome. The sound is still fresh after all these years and you can credit Benny and Bjorn for that. I cannot recommed this CD high enough! Go out and get it today!"
5,Best Compilation with ALL ABBA greatest hits,I love it and do my weight lifting exercizes to the music.It is upbeat and keeps me at it for 25 minutes.Who needs to pay for a health club when I can exercize in the privacy of my own home to music I choose.
3,Delightful Documentary,"I've always had a fascination with women's handbags and the stuff that's in them, so when I saw this video, I just had to order it. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It starts off a little slowly, but picks up when the women actually start talking about the things in their bags. It was wonderful to hear the stories behind each item. The documentary captured women from celebrities like Phyllis Diller and Roma Maffia to homeless women to a multigenerational family. Each woman displayed an uninhibited willingness to share her stories, often in a very witty manner. I do wish that the film allowed the viewer to actually see more of the physical purse objects, but in spite of this, it was very entertaining. ""In the Bag"" would be a good film to watch for a Girls' Night Out kind of evening."
5,A wonderful book.,Just found a journal I kept back in 2002 for books that I read! In it I wroteTwo orphan twins grow up in an orphanage and are treated poorly. They get a chance to spend time living and vacationing with an elderly couple. Loving-sweet-happy feel good book. Wonderful book. Recommended for kids grades 3 and up.
4,GOOD BOOK,"Okay, so I read this book right before 6th grade and I liked it and all, but its no ""Walk Two Moons"". Of course, after reading ""Walk Two Moons"" I set really high expectations for Sharon Creech novels not realizing how difficult it would be for anything except JK Rowling, Wendelin Van Draanen, and Meg Cabot to reach, but hey, I'm human - I make these mistakes all the time. Anyway, I really enjoyed this book and reccomend it to any Sharon Creech fan although I must warn you its not written in quite the same way as, ""Chasing Redbird"" ""Walk Two Moons"" ""The Wanderer"" or ""Absolutely Normal Chaos"" with the 1st person story. Its a little different. You'll like it just the same though."
4,I liked this book and recommend it.,"Though I normally prefer science fiction and fantasy books, I enjoyed Ruby Holler. It is somewhat similar to Holes by Louis Sachar in being a funny story with a few twists in which the good guys have previously suffered but eventually win. The book, which has a slight adventure story flavor, although it really isn't one, is about twins Dallas and Florida, orphans who have spent their entire lives in the care of mean, sometimes crazy, adults. When sent to Ruby Holler, a beautiful place in which there are only two houses, they are at first skeptical of the seemingly kind nature of the people with whom they are living, but then realize that these grown-ups are not so bad after all. I'm not sure how to describe this book, but it's definitely good, and I would recommend it to other kids."
5,ruby holler,"Ruby Holler is one of the best books I have ever read. I really liked this book because it tells an exciting story unlike some other books. This book is one where you can't just stop reading it. There are a lot of turns and surprising twists to this book. Overall, Ruby Holler is a very, very great book."
4,"Orphans, the trouble twins","The foster care system in America is just not right?Orphans treated like the twins Florida and Dallasmight end up as criminals?The authorities that they associate with the grown up world arethe twisted abnormal people that they have been farmed out with or controlled by all their lives.To meet these old people about the time they were planning to run away and ride the rails, is what this book is about.A lot of kids with real parents feel like orphans or books like this wouldn't be best sellers?One solution to adoption might be to take the prospective parents and the children and lock them up together for two weeks in a roomwhile they are observed.Bonding will either take place or not: if it doesn't the parents will be rejected. The two weeks is the time most people can get off for a vacation if they have a steady job.This book is av recommended one by grade school teachers as the children love it."
5,Ruby Holler,this book is about two twins dallas and flordia who always break the rules they get sent to a home with tiller and sarie who are very nice i think the author kow how te kids feel like mad sad confused upset
4,Ruby Holler,"This is a very good book. I have to admit the chapter numbers fazed me a bit, but...I stuck it out.The story is about twins Dallas and Florida Carter (I don't know how old they are), and how they have always ended up in bad foster homes, until this one elderly couple comes along that just may be different.This book is very lively and the imagery is wonderful. I would love to live in a place like Ruby Holler. I also think that the word ""putrid"" is quite funny.The thing that annoyed me was Florida and Dallas' attitudes; even after Sairy and Tiller were so nice, they still wanted to get on board a freight train and leave. Why the HECK would you want to do that? After they've shown that they do care?The ending was also blunt and unsatisfying...I just don't like it. Sorry, Sharon Creech.I recommend this book; you will like it. The ending, you'll probably hate, but the book, you'll like.Ellen."
5,GREAT BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My favorite character in Ruby Holler is Florida because she says 'Putrid' all of the time. I really liked this book. It seems like the author put a lot of effort into it.
2,But where's the rest of it?,"This book was on a summer reading list for school, and because I had enjoyed some of Sharon Creech's other books, I gave it a try. I remember waiting a while for things to get moving, but about halfway through I started to become more interested. The plot became more involving, the characters more lifelike. And then it ended. It ended so abruptly, in fact, that I wondered if while they were putting the book together they didn't just run out of ink. This is very disappointing, and even if she did come out with a sequel to resolve some of the many things she left unfinished in this book, I don't believe I'd read it. Ms. Creech, I hate to say it, but you let me down. As far as the two stars go, it's more like 1 1/2. You can consider the extra a pity half-star for the colorful and visually pleasing cover."
3,A Little Mysterious...,"I thought this book was good. The only problem is, it had a complicated story line, and was even a little mysterious. But I would read it if I were you... you might be surprised."
4,"""The Trip to Mackalack River""","This story takes place in the past and in Ruby Holler. It is important because it is where the two kids were more comfortable.This book is mostly about two kids Dallas and Florida always getting adopted by different people and that they are never like where they are at.The first half talks about when they meet all of their parents and the final ones. And the end of the book talks about them going to places and staying with their final parents.In my opinion I did like this book because its like being real in some ways like Dallas and Florida always act themselves. I like it when they say putrid bushes,rivers or anything is putrid to them. I would recommend this book because in the past and how Ruby Holler only has very few houses I mean very few houses."
4,GOOD BOOK!!!,"Ruby Holler is a book about 13 year old twins that are called ""The Troubled Twins."" They live with these mean foster parents, ""The Trepids."" They get slapped and put in the celler. Every couple they go with, they come right back! One day this sweet 60 year couple come and want to take these kids on a trip! But they would have to be seperated. They have never been seperated. They deceided to go. Ruby Holler is this magical little town where the couple lives! The couple tell stories to the twins about there children! This person was watching over the couples house for a while, when he found this paper telling about the twins! Could the kids be his?This is a great book but left me hanging at the end. If you like sad stories, little mystry, and adventrous books then I'd recamend this book."
4,Ruby Holler,"Ruby Holler is an excellent book. I liked it because there is suspense and funny points. It was fun to read about how troublesome the twins, Dallas and Florida, are and how different foster families managed them. I have read other novels by Sharon Creech and I personally think that this is one of her best books ever. I recommend this book to people who like adventure and a bit of mystery."
4,You will love Club Nisei,"I was in Japan in the mid-1950's and fell in love with the ""special sound"" music. Settle back for some of the most pleasant listening you've ever experienced!"
2,Works good but I've gone through 2 heating elements in 2 years!,I live in an apartment and I am an AVID griller so I needed to go electric to keep grilling. This was the first electric grill I ever bought. It cooks great but I have burned up 2 heating elements in just around 2 years now and thinking of trying some other electric grill now instead of spending the $49 for another heating element.
4,meco grill is great,"Works very well holds enough food for at least 4 people. Heats up fast and cooks all foods very fast. We use it when camping and grilling chicken, steaks, burgers, all come out fine. Easy to clean compared to former electric grill I returned. Definately would recommend"
5,Great Grill,"I bought this grill because I live in an apartment and cannot have a propane or charcoal grill on the balcony.The grill was easy to put together and in no time at all, I was enjoying all the barbeques I had been missing. This grill fits the bill perfectly......I LOVE it!!"
1,Should send it back,"It had to be assembled which I did not like. After it was assembled, it was very flimsy and cheap. I should have sent it back. The silver grate that goes on the inside was buckled and did not fit correclty. It fits very loosely. Also the grate where the electric plugs into fits loosley. The whole thing is very cheap and I feel that I wasted $75. Should have bought a George Foreman."
4,DBO Boat,"Grill seems to work fine, very little smoke etc. Being it's electric it takes longer to get hot enough to cook on than a gas grill, but that's OK. My only issue was ASSEMBLY!! Ridiculous! It took forever as a balancing act and almost needed four hands. There are certainly a lot of people I'll bet simply could not do it. I had to get someone stronger than I was to tighten the handle screws. Also the numbers on the assembly picture are very difficult to interpret."
4,Great Little Grill!,"I really like this grill! I live in an apartment complex, and gas/charcoal grills are not allowed. This is a great alternative! Very easy to use. The grates and the reflector pan can be put in the diswasher for easy cleanup. It's not the best looking grill, but it works great for the price! Putting it together was a bit of a challenge, directions aren't the clearest. You'll need a pliers, flat head screwdriver, and phillips screwdriver to assemble. A ratchet may also be useful for the side handle. It creates quite a bit of smoke while cooking - outdoor use only (unlike similar George Forman electric grills). I am one happy customer!"
4,great grill,"I bought this grill for my son in Mn. He was a bit discouraged with putting it together.After using it a few times he says he likes it. Used it for steaks & chops cooking with apple chips to get the smoke flavor, & turned out great.This is a nice grill as it is portable so can be used anywhere and anytime, summer or winter.Quick and easy,not as good as charcoal, but cheaper. I have had one myself for 9 years and I love it."
3,Hard to assemble,"I just finished assemblying the grill and haven't cooked anything yet. As I had read in the reviews, it was a rather difficult assembly job - harder than I expected. One of the wires on the cooking grid is missing a weld and it will sag under a load. I'll call the mfgr and hopefully get a replacement."
3,Middle School Math,"It was okay, but not what I was expecting - we still have the book and will keep it cause we love books."
5,Gorillas in the Mist,"Cellar of Books shipped my hard to find hardcover copy fast and the item was as promised. Made a great gift combined with ""Light Shining Through the Mist: A Photojournal of Dian Fossey""."
4,great,"The book arrived on time and it was as stated, no complaints, the service was great and it was worth the money paid."
4,Great,Great real story!! Make me want to be with her to study and save the gorillas! The pictures are nice but the paper is so thin!
3,"Les Miserables is the short English version, NOT the 6hr French version w/ English subtitles","Les Miserables is the short English version, NOT the 6hr French version w/ English subtitlesI almost bought this.Then I decided to look for the same item online elsewhere to see if I could find a review. I then stumbled across the link to another seller, and they had this gem, ""Please note that Les Miserables is in English, not French."" [...]According to IMDB, the English version is only 180 minutes, rather than the full 360 minute version (4 part mini-series, 90 minutes each). [...]I saw the French version on A&E; (tv station in the USA) with English subtitles, and I do believe their is a VHS version, but no DVD French 360 minute version w/ English subtitles.I'd be happy to be wrong about this version (please comment to let me know), or let me know if you can find the 360 minute French w/ English subtitles on DVD (region 1 or 0 preferred)."
4,The final articulation of thoughts,"I love the autobiographical touches of this collection. My favorite story is ""The Second Time Around"". I had many times thought of the naive generosity that Americans exhibit in contrast to Europeans, but had never been able to put this into words, until i read this story. I did not care much for parts of the book (the ghost tales, for example), but overall it is a worthy collection and an enjoyable read."
2,this is a really weird book,"I haven't finished it either the word that comes to mind to describe it is ""precious"". But I don't really quite know what to think of it. If you want to read something completely ""unlike"" then pick it up for a penny! (Whatever the lady's thoughts about death and aging, she dead now, so you might as well buy the .01 priced volume.) I looked her up on wikipedia and she was very lovely, but I can't help thinking a bit of a blowhard. I imagine that perhaps dear Djuana Barnes could relate to this prose."
1,Mcguire bamboo rake,"For over 30 years we have used Mcguire bamboo rakes to move tons of oaks leaves in our yard. Usually, they would last through one fall and the following spring. This year the new rake broke during the first use. Superficially the rake looks like Mcguire rakes have always looked. However, all the materials are cheaper, the bamboo is too thin to move leaves, the metal holding the rake together is not strong enough to hold the rake together, etc. etc. My husband took pieces off the old rake to rebuild the new one. We are now looking for a real rake since Mcguires are no longer adequate. Preferably, something NOT made in China."
2,"Fast easy treat, Not so great taste","This is so easy to make - add a little water, stir, put in the microwave, and you're good to go. It's very high fat though, and the taste isn't as good as baked items. We tend to put a lot of ice cream or whipped cream on it to help the taste, but that just adds to the fat content. I'd encourage anyone to try a single box from their grocery store before being this large package to make sure you like it."
1,Keypad Problems,I have 3 of these phones. I've had keypad issues on 2 of the 3. I was checking online to see if Motorola issued a recall on these. If not they should. I will be contacting them...
2,"good features, poor quality keypad","I bought this phone October 2003 and now I have to replace it only 14 months later. The Off/Cancel button on the keypad no longer works and I can't hang up the phone unless I put it in the cradle. The warranty only lasts a year.I was very happy with the phone until the Off button stopped working. It did not interfere with my wireless network. The built-in speakerphone was a great feature and I will only buy phones that have speakerphones now.Call me crazy, but I'm replacing it with another Motorola, the 5.8 GHz MD751. Staying with Motorola means I don't have to learn a new interface and I don't have to change my habits. Hopefully they made the keypad more durable."
1,Worthless,"The keypad on this phone stopped working after two years, making it impossible to answer the phone or dial numbers, causing arguments with my spouse for my poor investment choice. In disgust, I have resorted to using a $14 corded phone for home use (it works) and otherwise use my cell. Motorola will not be getting any more of my business - ever!"
1,Avoid it,Very poor battery life.. doesn't last for even an hour from day one. After couple of months it won't ring at certian times..Pros.Good LooksCons.Every thing else
2,Keypad Problems as well,I really loved this phone until the keypad started failing after one year of use. It was very disapointing. Based on the other reviews I will definately be contacting Motorola.
1,Keypad fails,"I have had 3 of these handsets for 20 months, and the keypads have failed on all three units.Secondarily, I have never found a comfortable position that makes good contact with my ear."
4,Best Cordless I've used so far,"We've definitely gotten at least 6 hours talk time out of our phone. This phone way beats out our old cordless, which truly had no battery power, no range whatsoever, and even when it was close to the stand, the sound was fuzzy. The sound on this phone, by contrast, is clear, even when on speaker phone. Switching is a breeze between speaker and private. I'm strongly considering getting either another one of these or the expansion phone for another room. I love how you can set different rings for day/nighttime, so ringing phones don't disturb sleep. My only (minor) complaint is that the clip is a little bit chintzy, mine broke when I tried to clip it on.Also, if you have lost the manual, check out the ""buying info"" section right here on Amazon.com. There is a pdf version of the manual right there. Very convenient."
1,good at first but breaks down,The product was great at first. Sure going by the battery gauge the phone has a short talk time but still lasts more then an hour after saying the battery is empty. So loved it then.But after half a year the keypad is hard to get working (takes many presses for the button to work) and the phone has these weird bugs. Some times when a call comes it it doesn't ring with the phone in the charger so it definatly has power and with it out. Some times in the middle of a phone call the phone acts like the phone was hung up and starts ringing like a new phone call is coming in. Only its the same person I was just talking to and no one hung up from what they could tell.
1,This phone sucks!,"We bought this cordless phone 8 weeks ago at Circuit City. The base failed yesterday. Motorola's only solution is to have you ship it to them (you pay for shipping - and you deal with having to buy another phone in the meantime, or go w/o).Here's a plug for OfficeMax though - I had initially thought my husband had bought the phone there, and when I called them about it, they said just bring it on in and they would replace it immediately. Circuit City, however, sucks royally. I was on hold for 30 minutes (on my cell phone, of course), waiting for the manager, as the adolescent sales rep who initially spoke with me was mentally challenged by the concept of a replacement phone. Finally after a long wait (and being hung up on once), the manager told me that I could bring the phone in for replacement.Final words? I'll never buy a Motorola phone again. I hope I can deter a few of you also."
2,Battery Issue,I have had this phone for 6 weeks and will be returning it today. The additional handset suddenly stopped showing the caller i.d. The only solution from Motorola is to exchange it. The phones also have a very short battery life. I have had the phone clipped to my belt for 3 hours and have spoken on it for only 10 minutes and it is already down to 1 bar out of a possible 3.The range and the clarity of the calls are good although I have had to turn the volume up to high in order to hear most callers.
3,Good Indie Horror,"Good production values and a number of fun scares. For an Indie production, it's better than most."
2,tick-tocktick-tocktick-tocktick-tock are we there yet?,"While I tried to like this film, I'm in agreement with those reviewers who didn't like it. It's tedious to sit and wait for something to happen. The supposed scares were lame, at best. I can't be as harsh on this film, as I have been on others, as it DID try to lend suspense to the proceedings, but it never gave anything that one would expect, by reading the back of the DVD case. There are other low budget horror films that deliver a whole lot more for the money.In defense of this film however, ""The 8th Plague was a notch better than ""Monster"" (no, not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one, the one with tentacles on the DVD box)."
4,Very entertaining,The filming was great; I attended the movie premier in Northern Virginia and was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Some parts of the movie were somewhat predictable - as most horror flicks are - but it was wonderfully gruesome and fabulously frightening.
4,Great Meal Replacement,This stuff is a great meal replacement as well as a protein supplement. I have one every morning before work. It blends well and tastes rich even in water. I add fiber and alittle cinnamon and I'm set. I recommend it.
2,Bad Taste,"I take a lot of protein powder so I'm used to the taste, but the Strawberry Designer Whey protein is among the worst I've ever had. Very chemical taste. Go with Optimum Nutrition."
3,Proteins...,"Great value for money (more product for less $$$), it does whatever it is supposed to do... BUT the taste? Forget it! If this is the ""new improved better"" taste, I am sure I couldn't even swallow the original one.I already had better tasting and better composed products, but I must admit, I had to pay more for them"
1,Grossy Vanilla ever!,"I read some reviews favoring vanilla's flavor, so i tried. Guest what? it was disgusting. One breath-hold and swallow. I've paid for it! Thankfully and finally i ate it all. Have you ever try unflavored?"
4,Good Protein. Mixes Well and Tastes Ok,"I'm a vegetarian and very active in the gym, so I consistently monitor my protein intake. I found this to be a good supplement - it mixes fairly well with water or milk. It's not the best thing I've ever tasted, but it certainly isnt bad (and from what I hear many powders have an awful taste.) The *only* bad thing I have to say about this product is that if I had more than 2 scoops a day, I started to have stomach cramps. It took me awhile to figure this out and I found others with similar problems. I will also add, however, that a lot of people have had NO problems at all. Everyone's body can react differently to different things, so I recommend you try if you are interested in finding a decent supplement, but monitor any GI changes you might experience and change the quantity you consume accordingly."
2,"Used to be good, last two cans have been awful.","I have tried a lot of different protein mixes and the chocolate and vanilla designer whey favors were my preferred choices for years. Last year I got a can of vanilla that tasted really bad. I thought it was a fluke and got a can of chocolate recently. It also tastes bad. They changed their label recently. I do not know if that corresponded to a change I the actual mix, but whatever the case, it has gone downhill."
5,"Flavor, ingredients and price are all just what I am looking for!","I find the strawberry flavor is not real strong, so it works great for me. The ingredients are also just what I am looking for and the price is one of the best."
3,"Great Tasting, High Cholesterol","I like this powder, tastes great. What I don't like is how they don't publish all the nutrition facts. Prbably wouldn't have bought this had I known its cholesterol content!!!"
4,Pretty Tasty,Easy to make. I pack the powder in a shaker cup and add ice cold water when I get the munchies. Tasty and convenient!
1,Stiff cord,"The cord is stiff / nonflexible. I compared it to the cord on my Porter Cable jig saw and it is stiff. I am returning the cord, do NOT want a cord that I have to fight with all the time."
1,Nigel Andrews needs to stop writing biographies.,"Nigel Andrews wrote a bio on Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was awful. He said Kindergarten Cop was an allusion to the Reagan era and the small children represented the divorce of modern society from the 1960s, or something like that. And just think, I always thought Kindergarten Cop was a comedy about a male macho cop who's stuck with some little kiddies for a week as a teacher. I was wrong, I guess. (End of sarcasm.)Andrews has no ""authorization"" in his bios, meaning he hasn't been given exclusive permission by Travolta (or Arnie). In this case he's just pulling stuff out of his butt and most of it is garbage. He tries to become a film critic and fails. He tries to detail Travolta's life, and fails. He tries to come up with insightful facts - and fails, because he has no permission to write anything of substance.A piece of garbage; the Schwarzenegger one is even worse."
4,A GOOD READ,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK DETAILING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF ACTOR JOHN TRAVOLTA. WE GET A NICE LOOK IN DETAIL ABOUT JOHN AND HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE. MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON HIS ROMANCE WITH DIANA HYLAND WHICH ENDED IN TRAGEDY AND HIS COMMITEMENT TO SCIENTOLOGY. ALSO A HIGHLIGHT IS LOOKING AT HIS MOVIE CAREER IN GREAT DETAIL. FROM HIS SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER TO MANY YEARS OF BOMBS, TO HIS CAREER FINALLY GETTING BACK IN THE WEIRD MOVIE PULP FICTION THE BOOK COVERS THIS IN GREAT DEATIL. I FOUDN THIS BOOK TO INTERSTING AND ENTERTAINING. RECOMENDED FOR ALL MOVIE FANS."
2,Couldn't really get into it even though John is my favorite.,The book rambled about uninteresting details although it picked up now and then with some interesting ones.
4,What a great way to start your day....,"Having recently injured my back I was anxious to learn about ways to keep my back healthy. I want to continue to lead an active adult life. I attended one of Mimi's sessions and was surprised that even after one session - my lower back pain was eased! My entire body felt relaxed and more limber! Not only are the stretches and toning exercises clearly demonstrated by Mimi but the music and background images (lovely beach) put you in the right frame of mind. The 2-15 minute sessions seem like no time at all. Give yourself the gift of time. Great job, Mimi!"
5,the best back exercise dvd i've found...,"i am 57 with all the standard back pains that come with the territory. i *love* this dvd!!! beautiful scenery, relaxing music, and by the time i'm done i'm all stretched out and the pains are gone."
3,Back in Shape,It's a good workout for the back. My only cricism is that the DVD could have had more content - only two 15-min. workouts. The user needs to repeat the same half hour to increase the commitment.
1,Way too gentle,"I found this DVD to be completely useless. The moves were very subtle, and I felt nothing other than the pain I bought it for. I have had much better results with Iyengar yoga and Pilates, as well as physical therapy stretches. Given that all of us have different bodies and ailments, it's really hard to know what helps until you try it out."
3,Good but a little boring,"This is a great DVD to strengthen and stretch your back, but I am used to a more fast paced work out. It would probably be beneficial for me to continue with this DVD, but because I felt bored I just couldn't get myself to keep doing it."
1,do not waste your money on this video,another worthless product...again Amazon needs to do some reviewing of some of these videos before allowing them to be sold to unsuspecting customers.
5,This works,"I was diagnosed with a herniated disc. I was sent to physical therapy and pain medications. My back pain was still there. My wife suggested I get Mimi's DVD. I am so glad I did. When I started the exercise program on the DVD, I still had back pain, but the exercises were gentle enough that I could still make it through all 30 minutes. As a result of following the program my back pain is relieved. I no longer have weeks that I have to walk crooked with back spasms. The program relaxs, strengthens, and stretches. I have flexibility I never did before.Mimi is a great instructor. I would recommend this tape to anyone with back problems. For the cost of one co-payment at physical therapy, I can now just put on the DVD and get results I never got at physical therapy. I no longer have to take the pain meds. I hope this doesn't sound like an informercial. I got the DVD and it worked. I feel better."
2,I've Fallen Down and I Can't Get Up,"Not exactly a Time of No Reply. This could have been so much better, and Nikki Sudden concedes as much. Instead, this is only best of what was left lying around; there is little to pacify even the most diehard fan here. The straight acoustic rendition of ""Fallen Down"" is fairly breathtaking, the short interview is fairly illuminating, and the Rise Above outtakes are only fair. After two years, Epic deserves something more comprehensive; they should have waited until his tapes could be properly catalogued. Regardless, the live version of Epic's best song, ""Emily May (You Make Me Feel So Fine"" is as good as it could be, and an indication that there is more to come posthumously from the late, great Epic Soundtracks."
3,Interesting but not by John Bunyan,"This work was written by George Larkin and published in 1711 with the title ""The World to Come; The Glories of Heaven and the Terrors of Hell."" It was later published as ""The Visions of John Bunyan"" and in the 19th century included in some collected works of Bunyan under the title of ""The World to Come; The Glories of Heaven and the Terrors of Hell."" However, it has long been known to have been written by Larkin more than 20 years after Bunyan died."
4,This book was very interesting,I really learned alot from this book and it came on time in great condition. Would recommend it to others
1,Visions of Heaven and Hell,"I ordered the book Visions of Heaven and Hell. However, what I received was a photo copy of the book stapled with a typed card stock cover. More than half the content was missing (since I had to purchase another book elsewhere). Very disappointed and will not order additional books."
3,"Good, but they've done better.","The title track to this album is my all-time favorite Saxon song, but I think ""Wheels of Steel"" is a much better album. Get that first, then move on to this one."
3,Good but not so good,"a good album, but one can already recognize the first symptons of Saxon tunring commercial. Nigel Glockler fits alright into the band, the songs ( albeit with great and first class production ) are not in the same league as the first albuns."
4,Great Classic,"Great classic, which I once had on vinyl, so nice to have it back in my collection, as it's one of his all time ""must-haves"""
1,What's the Point?,"I am starting to feel a little used with these aging musical stars like Tony Bennett and Elton John searching for any reason to release their umpteenth best of CDs. Happy Birthday Elton, thanks for Goodbye Yellow Brick Road version 25. The videos are nothing to get excited about either.PS: I am an EJ fan, but don't need to buy the same songs every year or so."
4,Elton at his best.,"I am a fan of the easy listening type of rock that guys like Elton John, Billie Joel, and Neil Diamond do so well. This album is a great example of the genius that places Elton at the head of his class when it comes to writing and performing."
4,John Bond Makes Getting Started Easy,"The whole time your reading this book you are thinking, ""now is the time to write that story down."" And this book makes it easy. I got it. I started writing. And I bought copies for a few friends.You'll be glad you got this book. And the people who read your stories will be glad you did too..."
5,Gives the one-page motivational thought plus quote that gets you writing,"As a patent attorney--and wannabe published novelist-- I write all day every day.Walking on Alligators gives me the one-page motivational thought plus quote that gets me writing when I am stuck, or simply procrastinating.At first I was hesitant to read a motivational book for authors, as there are so many. Then, I learned that it had even been translated into Japanese and was well received in Japan. I figured it had to be just right or terribly wrong for American writers. Fortunately, Alligators has proven to be just right for all writers, both published and unpublished.Full disclosure: I met Shaughnessy when I lived down the street from her years ago, and she practices what she preaches."
3,"Perhaps Scott's least skillful storytelling, but..","I thought that both ""mark of the warrior"" and ""love pavilion"" were greatly superior to this novel, which contains some suprisingly shoddy writing (rare for Scott). At least the novel has a close examination of the minute detail of 1950's Britain, as well as a plausible plot. But this book could have been written by Auchincloss at his worst. Scott is certainly the greater artist, which makes ""The Bender"" a considerable dissapointment."
4,Good beginners' book,"This is a beginners' book, and for those, I would recommend its use, but only in addition to using it with Gujarati's. Pindyck's book is very simple and well explained. Its advantage over other books is that it is concerned with forecasting, something that other basic books do not do. It is a little bit more advanced than Gujarati's but lays between that one and Maddala's book."
2,muddy reading,"The notation can be hard to follow if you don't have a grasp or natural incline for statistical regression. Steps are hard to come by in some problems because too many steps are skipped for a beginner. It is almost necessary to have at least a basic statistics background before reading this.Even though I had a background and had read ahead, I had to depend on my professor to truly understand the material at all. If your professor has an accent or goes quite fast, and if you don't have classmates you can work with, using this book alone will be more than painful.I would suggest a supplement such as ""Using Econometrics: A Practical Guide (4th Edition should suffice) [Hardcover] by Studenmund"" if you are just beginning to learn about regression."
1,Rather Cursory,Sommerville undoubtedly owns great knowledge over the topic. Unfortunately he has difficulties to write monolithicly. Most of the time he is beating around the bush. The examples he uses to explain the different topics are rather unusual and do not help to better understand what the techniques are all about.More detailed and concrete examples would have been helpful.I expected more from the Guru of Software-Engineering...
3,Not Two Boys -- But Then...What Other Book Is?,"This is not Jamie's best work. ""At Swim Two Boys"" deserves that rank. Still, it is a good short novel. The story (of a very strange boy) held my interest, and the writing is excellent. The ending did come as quite a surprise...and shock! At my age (73), I hope I live long enough to read many more books by this not nearly prolific enough writer."
4,Great Bookshelf!,"For the price, this is a great bookshelf. It's easy to put together. It had some minor damages, some weird discolored areas but they are not noticeable.They were mostly on the back of the bookshelf. It might look like it doesn't hold much weight, but it actually does. I have a 32 inch plasma TV that weighs about 30 lbs on the top shelf. Overall I think this is a great product. It goes great with other espresso furniture I have."
2,I'M TIRED OF THIS COMPILATIONS !,"This band released so much compilations, (like BEE GEES), that you end forgetting their real discography!"
4,amazingly easy to use,"This is a great way to transfer data between a PC and a treo or a camera. Works flawlessly. Would have given it 5 stars but it lost one because of the keyring case which can open unexpectedly causing you to drop and or lose the SD card. Surely they'll come up with something better, but until then don't use the case on your keyring."
1,Beware! Works great ... for a while!,"I bought this SanDisk Ultra II Plus 1GB SD card in December 2006 and it worked great for about 5 months. I used it in my HP camera and digital photo frame, and transferred files onto my computer using both the USB port and a card reader.Then suddenly it quit! I was looking at pictures on the photo frame one minute, next minute it couldn't be read. I tried it in my camera and in three different computers. None will even recognize it.I'm looking for another brand of SD card. I can't trust SanDisk anymore."
4,Great and innovative product but a little flimsy,"This card definitely worth the extra money, but everytime I take it out of my camera to use it as a USB card, I'm afraid of breaking it, since the whole contraption seems a little flimsy. But at that size what can you expect? So I try to use a USB cable whenever I can, and use the card directly only when necessary.Still, no one's complained about that yet, so maybe I'm just a little paranoid."
1,Product Failed During First Use,"Just as other purchasers have warned, this chip failed after taking about 250 pictures while I was on vacation. The chip froze up and the camera won't function with it, nor can I download the pictures. There is a manufacturer's flaw in this product. I have now purchased another brand. Don't use this chip for a camera or you will lose your pictures. I wish that I could get a refund rather than a replacement chip on the warranty."
5,Brilliant,"You don't need an SD card reader anymore. Just pop this card out of your camera, and stick it in an available USB port, and your computer adds it as a drive letter.If you don't have a lot of space around your usb port, it may not fit in, but that is the only downside to this card."
3,"Handy, but fragile (and pricey).","I think these cards are a great idea, especially if you have a mac book air or something with no card slot. They are a bit pricier than a standard form-factor memory card, but that's understandable. The problem I'm having is that the latch on the cover which swings down over the USB contacts is very thin and eventually cracked so that it won't quite lie flat. I can still get it out of the camera if I press on it just right, but it tends to be a pain. If you have a modern laptop with an SD slot built in, you might be better off getting a 'normal' card."
1,Will Not Eject From Canon PowerShot SD1000,"Sandisk's website specifically says this is compatible with the Canon PowerShot SD1000. While it will record and upload pictures, the SanDisk Ultra II SD Plus USB card WILL NOT EJECT from the camera. There are several other reports of this on other web sites. The divot by the right hinge on this card catches in the small A-shaped retaining clip just inside the Powershot's SD card receptable. The only way to get it out is with a very thin knife! Buyer beware! PS: Camera and card both less than 1 week old. Tested camera w/other cards and normal cards (without the hinge) work just fine. Would have tried the card in other cameras but I am taking it back before it gets stuck someplace again!"
5,Extremely convenient & highly recommended,"I reluctantly bought this item about one year ago (it was $10 more than the non-USB device), thinking the USB port was a gimmick. I could not have been more incorrect. You'll never need a card reader again. The USB port is very useful: You're at Grandma's and snap a few photos, pop this out and load the shots on her computer. Take a few photos at the kid's birthday party, and pop this in a PC, and you have an instant slide show. It also allows it to act as a thumb drive as well. the flexibility makes this well worth the incremental $10-$15 dollars.I use this device with a Nikon D50, and in burst photo mode the write speed to the card keeps up with D50, allowing ~2-3 shots per second.Con: a small one: the door that covers the USB ports is thin, and after a year's use, it has developed a small crack. I believe the device will work fine, even if the door break off, so I'm not to concerned about."
5,Great things come in small packages!,What a great idea! Combining the size of a postage stamp with 1GB of memory that can plug into any USB port or any SD camera. I don't have to keep track of all the different types of USB cables anymore - just pull the card out of the camera and plug it into the nearest computer to see the photos. Great when you're on vacation! I highly recommend this as your next thumb-drive purchase.
5,Excellent choice,"I bought this card along with a Nikon D50 and have taken thousands of photos so far. The best thing is of course the USB feature, but also this card is fast and reliable (almost 50% faster) than the stardard card when downloading photos to the computer. And, it comes with lifetime warranty.I wouldn't abuse the USB feature too much because there's risk of damaging it if you are clumsy, but rather buy a cheap SD card reader (MobileMate works just fine)."
3,Memory card struck,"I have purchased this item for Canon Power shot A610 camera.I took few photgraphs and I thought of uploading them onto my PC but unfortunately it got struck in the memory slot itself.I called the SanDisk customer support, but of no use.Any suggestions?????"
5,Works great with my Mac,"I bought this as a quick and simple way of downloading images from my Canon G10 to my Mac desktop, it works perfectly and is easy to use....couldn't ask for more!"
3,Nice to have but slow,"This is the old version. Speed is about 10mb, newer high capacity(2gb, etc) version works at 15mb. Even the Ducati version is slow at 20mb..."
2,A step in the wrong direction,"If you love Alice & Hell & Never Neverland, as I do, then this album may not be for you. It is way too mechanized and doesn't seem to have any heart. Every instrument track seems overly processed and tweaked with effects; this is a shame since Jeff is such a badass guitarist. This album does not sound anything like the early stuff. I highly recommend sampling it before purchasing."
2,5 out of 14 Songs are good!,"I saw an ad in a catalog for this CD and I ordered it because I'm Irish and I love Irish music, well I was really disappointed with this CD and think it had potential and could have been much better. The only songs I like are Galway Bay, To Welcome Paddy Home, Rambling Irishman, Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore, and Shores Of America, the rest of the songs were just way too mellow and I had to keep myself from dozing off! I guess I just prefer the more lively, energetic Irish songs that make you want to get up and dance a jig!"
3,Christ's Return 7 Signs,This information is accurate however brief. I follows the King James version and leaves you plenty to think about too.
2,Less Than Informative,"This short film may be very eye-opening for a totally uninformed person. For me, It was boring and I actually have more information."
1,A great work of fiction!!!!!!!,"Seriously the Bible is one of the best fantasy novels ever and since this is basically a teaser trailer for a sequel, how could you not love it?!?!?! Brilliant!!!"
5,Good book for college,I took immunology in college and this book definitely helped with the complex material. I would recommend this book to anyone who is taking immunology.
3,Rating = 3.5 Stars,"What started off as a lean, mystery-laden thriller disintegrated into a Grade-B horror novel. Nevertheless, read the entire novel on a flight from the West to East coast. Author shows real command of the language and understanding of the genre. Will definitely buy his next novel."
5,Flat Out Awesome!!!,"I finished ""Chasing The Dead"" in one day. It has got to be the best book that I have ever read, and I have read many books! Intense, a nail-biter, with a great ending, this book is a must read!!"
4,"Not You Usual ""Kidnapped"" Book","A phone call suddenly grabs Sue's attention when the caller informs her that he has her daughter and if she doesn't follow his specific instructions she will never see her daughter again. This isn't your typical ""kidnapped book"", it takes a bizarre twist midway through that has you turning the pages very quickly. Quite a few ""ohh"" and ""yuck"" moments, but still a good read."
3,NOT FOR NEWER COMPUTERS,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AND WE TRIED TO INSTALL IT ON OUR MAIN COMPUTER AND IT WOULD NOT LOAD PROPERLY, WE HAVE WINDOWS XP, I HAD TO DIG OUT AN OLD COMPUTER THAT HAD WINDOWS 98, IN ORDER TO USE THIS GAME. IT WORKS FINE BUT NOT FOR NEWER COMPUTERS"
5,"Aasif's Treasure, Today's Special - Trust Me","I've seen the film twice in the movie theatre and told anyone who would listen to me, what a treasure Aasif's film is.This is actually a well written story with wonderful dialogue, interesting characters, and lots of laughs,(even a tear for the heartwarming dad/son scene... paraphrase, everything is possiblehere (NY).No special effects that bring the brainless BITS, and sadly not enough publicity, so this gift did not play long enough in Houston, TX.I pre-ordered the DVD back in March and I look forward to sharing it with my friends, when we have a Big Movie party night. Hooray for the film and for the talented Mr. Aasif Mandvi, he is also a wonderful comic gift."
5,Loved it!,"Great film, Aasif Mandvi!I went to see this movie with my friends and we had such a good time. It's charming, whimsical and all around uplifting. It inspired me to go home and make Indian food. I didn't because that requires a lot of spices so instead I just ordered it. Either way, loved the movie and so glad that it's FINALLY coming out on DVD. Can't wait to see it again."
2,Not worth the wait,"After waiting months for the dvd due to delays in the release I was hugely disappointed. I was expecting a comedy type video with all the reviews i read on here, but i found nothing funny in the film at all."
2,"No sound from actors,street noise","Purchased this in good faith,I've ordered before and liked my purchases.But this movie nothing,it was like a old silent movie,like the mute was on but it was not.Really was looking forward to watching movie,But...."
5,The conclusion,I really loved this cartoon when it aired and it is great to finally be able to see the last episodes that I'd missed.
2,Does not worth your time,"Second book I got on Amazon about interrogation technicians. Second time I feel like the book is written by request of the police department. Making sure we know what to do, when we are being interrogated. Do not waste your money on this. Better get an education in the field and some practice."
1,This book is a waste of time.,Information is not accurate and police officers I know find its publisher highly unethical. Don't use for anything but light reading to amuse.
5,Touching and Life-affirming,"This is a well-written and beautiful story. Thank you for sharing it with us, Amy K."
5,Investigative and Compassionate,"This profound memoir detailing the author's thorough investigation into HLHS will not only strike a cord in the hearts of readers, but more importantly will share valuable information needed for those struggling in their decisions regarding the medical, emotional and spiritual well-being of their children. Kuebelbeck's research helped the couple to make the right decision for their baby, as proved by their medical specialist's finding their baby had one of the most severe cases of HLHS, and would have suffered needlessly. Truly an informative, yet passionate read."
1,No Hope,"In haste I purchased this book, thinking it was about parents who gave their child a chance at life, needless to say, I was mistaken. If you are looking for an excuse to not fight for the life of your child this book is the answer, but if you are looking for hope, comfort and strength then look elsewhere. As a father, who has been blessed, with a child with a CHD, specifically HLHS, I was saddened to see these parents not give their child a chance. Stay away from this book."
5,Gabriel's story of Love,"This is a beautiful book. Yes, it is heartbreaking and deeply emotional. Yet through the emotional pain and sadness there isa feeling of Love so powerful that you can almost feel it draw up to you from the pages.I imagine that most who read this book will be parents who have either suffered the devastating loss of an infant or are about to. This is also a book for their friends and family. If you have someone dear to you who has lost an infant, or will, please read this book. Even if the parents are only aquaintances...a neighbor down the street, a co-worker you only know in passing, someone you see at church...please read this book.Amy has written a beautiful book about Gabriel,it is a book for parents everywhere, and as I said - even though it is about an aching loss, it is also about Love."
5,Helpful book for parents that have lost an infant,I recently lost a daugher to a congenital heart defect and though it was a differnt type of defect I really felt like I could relate to what Kuebelbeck writes. My story was different from her's but so very much likes hers as well. It was comforting to know that someone else has been through what I've been though.
3,Razor,Decent razor. Not the closest shave but does a decent job. Very sleek design. Would prefer if it had a docking station.
5,Very Satisfied,"I've used a blade to shave my whole life. I've recently retired and my life is more relaxed. So, I wanted a good electric razor that I could use to get a decent shave. I've been surprised and very pleased with my Reconditioned Braun 7526 shaver. I'm getting an excellent shave, almost as close as I received with a blade. The price was also attractive to me. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,Braun 7536 reconditioned,The first 7526 I ordered had a problem with the battery. It was not holding the charge at all. Amazon replaced it right away and sent me the second one which is working nicely.
3,"Decent, not amazing","I bought this electric shaver after reading positive reviews on an electric shaver blog. This shaver allegedly gives the best shave at 60 % faster shave time due to the larger holes in the razor screen, and also needs recharged 1 or 2 times/month.My experience is this new model does not exceed my old mid-level Braun. This new Braun misses several hairs on my face daily and makes me go over and over at different angles to get it cut, but then I have slight razor burn. The razor screen protector is awkward to remove each day, and I want to protect the screen so it doesn't get torn. I envisioned an extremely quick, turbo shave due to the screen holes bigger diameter (they aren't bigger than my 10 yr old Braun), and completing the shave in one or two passes over each area, so as to eliminate razor burn. This razor is decent, but the perfect shave has still eluded me."
5,good deal,i originally purchased this same razor at Target for 100.00.A day or two later i was online and just happen to look up this exact same model on Amazon and it was 1/2 the price. It is of course recoditioned but after receiiving it i was please that there appeared to be no difference. It has a full warrenty as well.Thanks Amazon
4,Close Shave,"I have had good luck with refurbished electric razors from Braun, and this one is no exception. It gives an excellent close shave, and the refurbished price is excellent for this product. Highly recommended."
2,OK,"Works OK, but it's loud and the cleaning solution is a pain to deal with. Better to just rinse it off."
1,"The foil, (screen), won't stay on!","Infuriating. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to shave with the Braun 7526. The screen keeps popping off! I've used it for only 7 months, but I am going to have to look for a new one. It won't be a Braun.I later learned the foil stays on if you push on the black plastic wings on the side of the foil and not on the top of the foil. So, now I'd give it 3 stars."
1,False Advertisement,"The product is not as described, DOES NOT come with charger nor cleaner refil.BUYER BEWARE!"
3,"Hey, It's an electric","I suppose the shaver does what it is supposed to do. It's just that I have used a blade since my Norelco died 30 odd years ago and am not used to electric shaving. I was hoping that improvements in design might actually lead to a close, comfortable shave. But alas, all the bells and whistles do is give the same old sort of close, razor burn shave. Braun states in the directions to give it 3 weeks for your beard to adjust to the shaver as if using the thing will cause a physiological change in your facial hair that magically allows the shaver to cut more close and comfortable after 21 days. Don't count on it. The automatic cleaning/charging unit is a nice feature but does not improve the shave. The reconditioned unit works just fine. No problems there. It's just that the shave is more of a ""clean up the face for work"" shave than a ""rub cheek with your girl"" shave."
1,Not as ordered,"I didn't not receive all the self cleaning parts nor did customer service want to help much over the phone. The text has been changed since and so I had to fight them on what it said when I ordered. If it hadn't been for the other reviews I'd not have gotten my point across. Thanks guys! This is now the second problem I've had with Amazon. Are they not trying as hard? At least they gave me a 20% refund for all the hassle.The actual shaver is great, works well, but now I have to find a cleaning base to complete it. Feels much better then my old Braun which lasted many years. It is a great shaver."
2,Not For Heavy Beards,"I have always used an electric shaver. This product is my first Braun and it is large enough to fit my hand. Even using preshave, it takes more than 7 slow storkes to get most of the beard, more than 12 and still a slight stubble remains. It did not come with a charger-cleaner base. I find this is not necessary as releasing the foil & running for 5 seconds clears the cutters. Every third day I remove the foil & cutters, rinsing under hot water & gently brushing, then setting aside till dry. When I want a realy close shave I resort to my 1950 AC-DC Remington three head flat bar shaver."
1,don't buy this ripoff prouct,Beware it doesn't include the base. Amazon sells it without metioning this point. I have seen these exact same reconditioned model sold on ebay etc. and they all point out that fact. I emailed Amazon and they said it was too big of a problem to fix eight weeks ago. They still haven't updated their site to state that this does not include the cleaning base like a braun 7526 should. Truth in advertising is very impotant on the internet.
4,reconditioned but call Braun if....,"I ordered this reconditioned shaver several weeks ago and figured that it would take me a few weeks to get acclimated to using an elecric shaver instead of the Gillette Mach 3 razor that I have been using. The shaver is great except, for me, it did not shave my neck thoroughly. I finally called Braun and they could not have been any more pro-active. They sent me a brand new cutter block/foil at no charge and it arrived in 3 days. I now get a very close shave and am very happy with my purchase. If you find any minor problems with your shaver, I suggest that you call Braun customer service as they seem eager to make sure that you are happy with their products."
4,Braun always a good shave,I purchased a 7526 Factory Recon. It gives a great shave like all of the braun shavers I have had over the past 25 years. One problem is that it came with the on off switch malfunctioning. Perhaps it was checked quite carefully enough or it was damaged in shipping. I am returning to get the same model. I like the shave but can't deal with the shaver going off if I don't hold the face firmly in place while shaving.
1,Can not match Norelco Performance,"I have been using Norelco since past 3 years. I tried to go for Braun 7526 after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was not good.Pros:++ Little bit closer shave then Norelco.++ Good Price. Amazon rocks!!Cons:-- Need to clean every 2-3 days where as Norelco can be cleaned every 2 weeks.-- Unit was not very clean as described.-- Difficult to shave 2 or more days of growth.-- More noisy then Norelco-- Very Low Durability. The foil on my shaver is broken in just 3 months and it is not covered under warranty. So, I need to spend about $30 to replace the foil and cutter as they come together. I will rather discard this unit all together.-- Customer Service at Braun not upto professional standard."
4,Good electric shaver at a good price,"I like the design and feel of the shaver. It has an incredibly long charge time. I have used it for 3 weeks every day and it still has a charge to the point where I haven't been warned that it needs charging. It does a good job shaving.The cleaning of it is very easy. All you have to do is partially open the top of it, turn it upside down and turn it on. It then shakes out the debris on its own.I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anybody."
4,"Quiet, close shave, good value",Used a braun 6520 for several years before I dropped it & broke it.The 7526 is quieter and provides an equivalent shave (very good!). It actually does even better on the neck; it takes fewer passes and gets the problem hairs quickly. I agree with a previous reviewer that the placement of the switch is unfortunate and it is easy to inadvertantly move the position.I find the shave closer than what I can get with a razor blade shaving 'down.' There is also less irritation.
5,Great razor at a great price,"Brought two of these factory reconditioned razors, one for myself and one for my father. We both have found them to be far superior to other electrics we've used in the past (Remington, Norelco, Sunbeam). Delivered in plain box but in as-new condition. It doesn't come with the cleaner base, but how hard is it to pop a screen off and brush it out? Not very. A hundred dollars hard? - I don't think so. Great shave at a great price."
4,Better than I thought,"I bought this razor for my boyfriend. He gets ingrown hairs from shaving with a razor and so we thought he needed an electric shaver. I originally wanted to get him a norelco however they were all very expensive. We didn't want to spend a lot of moneyand I had heard that the Braun was good. The price was excellent and I figured if it didn't work well I could always return it.It works really, really well. It seems brand new. He gets a very close shave (which surprised me), and no more ingrown hairs. And what they say is true: your hair has to ""get used to"" the shaver. Everytime he shaves it gets easier and gives a better shave. I highly recommend this product. Also, the battery life is excellent and it charges quickly."
4,Great Buy,Bought it on sale for 24.99 (reconditioned). Intended only for beard trimming but once I tried the full face shave I'm never coming back to a regular razor.
3,Just a good shaver,"I'm a wettie, but Amazon had this on sale for $ so I snapped it up. So did a friend. For that price it was a steal. As of this writing, Amzon has it for $. Still a deal... And I have to say, 'it's just a shaver'. Shaves fine, but nothing amazing or particularly special. It just shaves your growth away. One thing is that it is not so noisy and that is pleasant. Do an internet search and if you can't get it for less than $, then buy it from Amazon..."
4,High Quality Low Price,"My 4 year old Panasonic shaver needed a new screen and blades. For the same price, I could get this reconditioned Braun shaver. I have never had a Braun, but knew it had a great reputation. 8 months later it is still going strong although the blades are getting close to needing replacement.Pros:- Shaves as close as a shaver costing 3 times as much- Solid, expensive feel- Foil is thick enough not to break when dropped (Had that happen with the Panasonic)- Nice travel case- Relatively inexpensive replacement foil/bladesCons:- Not waterproof- Blades seem to dull a little faster then Panasonic shavers- Does not have Smart battery system as advertised, need to drain the battery periodically manuallyOverall great product at a great price."
3,Not quite as good as expected,"I bought the Braun 7526 to replace my Panasonic shaver. Overall, I don't like it as much.Pros:1) Shaves closely2) Charge lasts a long time3) Has a LED that indicates the charge is almost goneCons:1) Takes a long time to shave (longer than any other electric shaver I have used)2) No charging stand3) Shavings are not collected in the shaver head and fall out (meaning you basically have to shave over the sink)"
5,Braun Cleaner/charger base,"I was able to find the base at: http://smallappliance.com/ Cost $47, does an excellent job. So the total cost of the shaver comes out to around $90. Still not bad.Dave"
5,Best Deal!!!,"Bought this reconditioned shaver after much debate. Read all the previous comments but thought for [the price], can't miss. Been using mostly Norelco brand electric shavers and needed to replace it. I am new to the Braun foil type shavers but so far have been impressed with its ability to get a decent close shave.Holds charge for over 2 months of daily shavings which is very surprising. Even though it is reconditioned, I still think this was an awesome deal knowing the price is now ... more. Wow. Can't expect more but will look for the base cleaner unit for good price later somewhere.Thanks Amazon!!!"
2,It worked fine for a while,I am over 60 and I have been using Braun shavers all my life. This was the finest one for about 2 years. By now it stopped shaving. It became noisy and takes forever to get anything but a close shave. I noticed that the cutting block has a huge play. It has probably reached the level when it does not move through an entire hole in the foil any more. I do not think replacing the block would help since the hole in the plastic part that tranfers the motion to it got enlarged. Looks like it is a design flaw. Other customers who complain about the slowness of the shaving and noise most likely experiencing the same problem in progeress.
1,Considering a Factory Reconditioned Braun Shaver ?,"Impressed with the Braun name, and having read a few reviews warning about factory reconditioned units, I purchased it anyway at a great $39.95 price. Ultimately, the problem was the cheap little plastic ON/OFF switch. Move it up and the shaver turned on. With much effort, I finally got the switch to slide up higher to the ""clipper"" mode. Problem was, it stayed stuck in this mode and would not budge downward. When I finally did get it down, the thin metal element beneath the switch was damaged. What a cheap, crappy switch Braun decided to use! Why, who knows. Amazon promptly refunded my money. Thanks."
3,No clean & charge base or refill,"All I recived was the shaver, charging cord and brush. I am sending back and requesting the clean & charge base with the refill.This is a great shaver...have borrowed my sons...but I would like to get what was ordered."
1,Battery won't hold a charge,"I purchased this good shaver, plugged it in for 6hrs and expected my new shaver to caress my face. However, it never worked! My wiskers are going to have to stay on for an extra day. The factory recommended that the new charger be plugged in for 4 hrs. I did that and 2 more! As we speak, I have the shaver plugged in, the red light is flashing (this indicates that less than 20% of a charge on the battery), and my bushy face is getting bushier. Buyer beware! Also, this product DOES NOT come with the cool Clean & Charge Storage Stand. Bummer."
3,The electric plug in outlet does not work well,"Everything was good to go until I realized that the electrical outlet needs to be attach very firmly, usually it'll only work on a power strip. It just doesn't stick on very well, I have an adapter that I hook up to it that suctions the electrical power recharger thing for it to work."
2,NO electric shaves like a blade... sorry,"I bought this same shaver from Amazon last month (a refurb model). It arrived in great shape, and it works as expected. But after giving myself plenty of time to adjust to my first electric razor, I can tell you confidently that it is NOT blade-close. I doubt any electric is, really. I have to shave twice a day with this thing if I'm going out in the evening. Not so with my old 50-cent disposable twin blade. Even right after shaving I can't get my lower jaw or neck as smooth as a twin blade could. And how's this - it takes LONGER to shave in the morning than it used to!So why am I still using it? Good question. Maybe I'll post mine for sale."
1,"I'm rarely disappointed with my orders, BUT","This shaver barely maked a dent in my beard. To get anywhere near to a close shave, I must go over the area repeatedly. Even, then, my disposable razors far outshine this debacle. After I saw that it was not an every-day shaver for me, I was going to use it when I travel, just to touch up. Even then, it's not a real shaver. I saw other good reviews. Do you have peach fuzz for a beard? Mine is, I think, average. At any rate I am going to try and return this. Whew!"
2,I think I got a lemon...,"I used to own a Syncro 7570 which was top of the line when I bought it. I was extremely happy with it and can honestly say it was the best reazor I ever owned. Sadly I left it behind by mistake on a vacation. So, I took the cheap route and bought a refurbished 7625 to replace it. I assumed it was basically the same razor without the LCD display but was sadly disappionted. It is far louder, much more rough against the skin, vibrates radically and doesn't shave as close. I really miss my 7570!"
2,It didn't work,"The first one I received didn't work. Exchange is fairly convenient, but I have read other reviews with the same problem."
1,False Advertising,The seller needs to do a little research. The 7526 is the shaving system with the automatic cleaner. What is advertised here is the 7505 shaver only.
3,good not great,i have had other razors that deliver a closer shave but all in these is a good product
5,Real Bang For The Buck,"I've owned my Braun which I bought on Amazon for over a year now. I have no complaints whatsoever. Any spot that was difficult to shave is still difficult relative to the rest of my face, but much less difficult than with previous razors. I find it very easy on my face. Cleaning is a breeze if you follow the instructions and partially open the screen and run it for a few seconds. Why anyone would spend money on the cradle and cleaners is beyond me. The battery still lasts me at least two weeks between recharging as indicated by the flashing red light. The beard trimmer works great. It would probably cut grass if you wanted.I would never consider spending the small fortune a new system with the cleaning cradle costs these days. This does everything I could ask of it at a very reasonable price."
4,Good electric shaver,"I really like this shaver. I have a bread, and just use it to clean up my cheeks and neck, so it really saves time over using a razor. My brother has the same model, so i can use his cleaning dock. It really clean the shaver well. I wold probalby recomend getting one with the cleaning dock if you dont have access to one"
5,"GREAT Shaver, Thanks.","I was uneasy about purchasing a reconditioned shaver, but this is brand new. I LOVE MY NEW Braun shaver. I purchased a Norelco 8894XL in November, the Braun is far better than the Norelco. I will be sending the 8894XL back to Norelco for a refund. Thank you Braun and Amazon."
5,Look new for a factory service unit,Received this unit 3 days ago and i've been using it ever since. The unit i got look brand new with a factory service sticker on the handle. This is a great bargain considering the price and the quality of the unit. It works/performs well and does come with a 2 years warranty.
1,braun Razor,"I am very disappointed with this shaver.Try as I might I do not get a close shave.The stubble simply stays there.So I am shaving with a razor blade now 2x a week to keep myself well groomed.My previous shaver was a Norelco which I used for 14 years,until it stopped charging,it always gave me a decent shave. John Le Cheminant."
3,"Shaver-Great, Amazon-Poor","Originally ordered reconditioned shaver only, for $39.99 in early Dec. Shaver works great, better than my old Braun 6525. Then saw entire reconditioned system for $49.99 so I ordered that as well. As with other posters, I received no cleaning components. Amazon sent me a replacement, but still no cleaning components. Then I saw the price for entire system lowered to $39.99. When I informed them of the second error, I too was offered the 20% discount, which would only put my price at the currently offered $39.99, really no discount or attempt to rectify problem. Amazon should have made good on their error and provided all components of the shaving system that were offered in the ad. Ad has been corrected and now only shaver offered."
2,Inspect the blade CAREFULLY!,"The refurbished 7526 I received had 4 blades missing from one side, you have to look very closely. It shaves much better with a new blade but that cost $25, I didn't catch it time for a return. For the total price I could have bought a new one. Learn from my mistake! Check that blade ASAP."
3,Amendment ...,"To the seller:Can you amend your product for Intenraitonal Shipping available .?Justin, London"
1,Possible Contamination by Infected Blood,"Due to the fact that certain blood born infections remain virulent despite heat and chemical attempts at disinfection, hospitals now use ALL disposable instruments. Scissors, staple removers, forceps, as well as syringes, scalpels, and sutures are SINGLE USE. Hepatitis C patients are universally counseled to keep razors inaccessable to children and guests. In my opinion, the resale of used razors should not be permitted, as the reuse of contaminated instruments is not permitted."
1,Upset.,"I ordered this shaver yesterday. Received confirmation today that it shipped already. Thats good. I'm sure that I will enjoyed the shaver, but today you have lowered the price by five dollars. I feel cheated."
1,Product NOT received,Never received the Braun shaver but would like to.Could you check it out?ThanksDon Smith
1,Reconditioned!,"""RECONDITIONED shaver does NOT come with Clean & Charge Base""It's worthless if you don't get that. Just make sure you know what your doing when you order it. I just noticed it so I'm not going to get the RECONDITIONED one."
4,Lovely,"Her prose is elegant and pleasurable, her scholarship particular, and her imagination delicate. After I read this book I wanted to rush out and read more Woolf and Nunez (and did). Please read to the end, it's so simple and resonant."
1,Smells terrible,"The pillow looks great, but it smells so bad, chemical-like, that you don't really want to put it next to your child. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't want to place it next to anybody."
2,Wrong picture for the pillow I got,"I ordered this pillow for my sons room and I got a TOTALLY different pillow. One would assume that the pictured pillow was what I would be getting. Instead I got a pillow with a ""shadow"" of Anakin and Obie Wan duelling. It's an okay pillow but a HUGE dissapointment since my son was expecting the pictured one. I would be careful from purchasing from Target on Amazon."
2,Not a Fan,"I got this book for a grad school stats course. While the material covered thus far is relatively easy to understand, the book certainly doesn't make an effort to present it clearly. Generic rules are stated, followed by samples whose solutions require caveats that were never explained. At times problems are ambiguous or spend too much length setting the scene without getting to the meat of the problem (e.g. reading an entire paragraph of a problem before the statistical relevance becomes clear) Attention is not paid to details. Solutions to odd problems are a great help... why not even numbers? In stats, having the answer is a great help when it comes to figuring out where you went wrong in a problem or in a statistical method."
1,"Teachers, Please Don't Use This Book","This has to be by far, the worst college math book I have encountered. The authors were so intent on providing real life examples and data they forgot to explain anything. Their descriptions are written for those who speak statistics as a second language not the average student or grad student. The text more often confuses me than helps me.Also, It is very irritating that I cannot obtain the answers to the even problems even with the study guide. As adults, if college students want to cheat on homework assignments that's their business and they'll fail the tests on their own. But please, for honest students who need more than average assistance in statistics, the even answers would be appreciated."
2,Terribly written,"I would not recommend this book for anyone who actually needs to understand the concepts of probability and statistics. The notation is bad and most exercises are tedious and add little insight. Instead, I would recommend Milton and Arnold's book (which is a bit outdated, but wonderfully written) for any serious stats student. I gave this book two stars (I think I may be acting a little overgenerous) because it has a nice list of tables of distribution functions in the back and because of the abundance of exercises, some of which are worth working through."
1,O.K...But nothing Great,"I had to use this book for an undergrad course in Prob & Stats at Univ. of Idaho. I'm in Comp.Sci and I can tell you one thing..I don't think this book is targeted for students who aren't doing a degree in Math/Stats or Physics..Things aren't explained clearly and lack clarity. The book tries to use professional level examples and problems but forgets to realize that students from different majors may have a tough time dealing with other fields..Like for me, a CS guy, when the book had a problem on dynamics..I was basically unable to apply my Prob. & Statistics knowledge to that problem..cause i don't even know how to begin dealing with it..I think it'll be good for reference when you've completed the course (using another book I hope)..Cause it really shouldn't be used as a First Semester College text in Stats..The last thing I want to say is that as a CS guy..Probabilty needs more stress than statistics...i don't know about the other engineerings.."
1,Where are the problem statements?,"This text has many examples, but if you look closely, there are no problem statements anywhere in those examples. As the example goes on the solve the problem, the reader finally ""gets"" what the problem was half way through the solution. Many say that in industry, there are no problem statements such as those found in exams, but in the ""real world"" the employee does have an idea of what direction he or she is headed in. The example problems, as well as the tendency to ""hide"" formulas in text, causes many of my classmate and I to curse the day this text was written!"
1,Defective and Shoddy Merchandise,"[...]I ordered these earrings as a Christmas present for my wife. About two months after the order, the stone for one of the earrings broke into two pieces. There is a hole drilled into each amethyst stone through which a support is threaded to hold the earrings. It is along this hole that the stone cracked. It was the second time my wife had worn them.[...]"
3,The Finer Things,"This 4 CD set shows how really good Stevie was in the 60's and 70's and how really bad music overtook him and almost everyone else in the 80's. The first 3 CDs show what the young genius could do. He played with three terrific bands and created some of the best jam band, jazz and drug influenced music of the generation. The fourth CD is a sad reflection of electronic drums, synthesized keyboards and awful mixing that was the 80's. Underneath the noise I think there might be some good songs. 3 out of 4 ain't bad!"
4,13 year old loves this,"My daughter loves this movie. She has a fun time watching it with her friends, who mostly haven't seen it. Not a big hit when it came out but a clean and fun movie."
4,gift,"Purchased as a gift. Received in the time promised. Not given yet, but do not expect any issues. Good buy."
5,great products at great prices! :),"Ordered this movie for my kids ~ they love it! Great transaction, great product @ a great price! Thank you!"
5,Incredible movie!,"I really didn't expect much of this video. I just watched it to make company to my 15 year old daughter, but I was extremely and pleasantly surprised by the whole film, the songs, the acting... well, I fell in love with it. Highly recommended as a family night movie."
5,Lemonade Mouth,"Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter. Excellent movie for her on the days that we are stuck inside (rainy day camping, going to work with one of us, etc). Great movie!"
1,coffee mug cream,Unfortunately this item arrived with a flaw in the glaze and was unusable.I am waiting for a replacement
4,Thought provoking,"As a traditional but liberal Christian, I found this turn- of- the- century work quite thought provoking. I don't agree with everything mentioned, but many things I will have to think about."
3,"Typical ""Secret teachings"" Gnostic Dribble","Although I was impressed with the authors subtle twisting of scriptural passages, it was for the most part modern ""Gnosticism"". However, it was a insight into the anti-established church movement of the early 20th century, it provided some fodder for theological reflection, but was more focused on ""secret teachings"" for the ""selected few"". I would not recommend it for anyone that does not have a strong root in Christian theology. However, new-agers or those unhappy with traditional Christian teachings will love it."
2,not what I thought,This is not a book I would recommend. Not a pleasure reading. This is more for someone who wishes to see other sides of christianity
1,"great program; however, 10 years old and no longer suported by microsoft or windows 7","I personally used this program exclusively despite owning Photo Shop for my six years of College; however, it is no longer supported by MS, or Windows 7 for that matter. I am now using Serifs Photo Plus and Page Plus and paid less than $130.00 dollars for both; which combined, have far more functionality and are fully supported in both my windows 7 and Virtual XP. PhotoDraw was Great program, but far to risky to load and use now. I'm surprised MS has given up on graphics programs, I'm sure PhotoDraw would rate an easy 5 stars if they reintroduced it without any changes to the original, depending of course on price. There are a lot of people including me at 64 that make a hobby of graphic manipulation."
5,Absolutely Perfect,"If you're a PC person and want to do graphics like those Mac people with Photo Shop, this is the program for you. Nine years after I originally bought this product, I still use it on a daily basis. Those Photo Shop people have to do multiple tasks to get things done, when PhotoDraw V2 gets them done in one click. The ease of use of this product made me a believer in its capabilities."
1,missleading,this lunch box was much smaller than what it appeared on site. I think a better product descriptions would help.
3,A nice album,This album has some good and some average songs. i can say that is just an ok album but much better than their first albums where they were playing stupid thrash metal. I recommend this album only to Annihilator fans -> its not something special.
5,The Best Salt in the World,"I love this Salt, I always used it in England. My son used to bring it for me, every Easter and Christmas. Now =I buy it direct from Amazon. Wonderful!!"
4,Tasty,I bought this due to a review I had read regarding the quality of the product and I do have to agree. It is definitely one of my favorite finishing salts.
2,Looks nice but....,"because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread. Some parts of your steak are saltier than others. It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special, to my buds anyway. I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be 'applied' evenly. Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered."
5,A gorgeous Celtic album...!,"Not actually a ""various artists"" release, however: Len Graham, Garry O Briain and vocalist Padraigin Ni Uallachain are all co-collaborators on this fine Celtic outing. A lovely and delightful album, featuring pretty, lavishly melodic versions of over two dozen obscure Irish children's songs. Graham's old-man voice is always a delight, while for her part Ni Uallachain fills these songs out with a classic Celtic sonorousness. The material is pleasantly unfamiliar, playful and engaging, while the arrangements are richly fleshed out and satisfying. Nice disc -- highly recommended, especially as the title might lead some Celtic music fans to pass it by."
2,Nice songs...,"but a little boring after the 12th song, which sounds the same as the previous one. Not a CD we listen to much."
3,OK enough,Got as a gift for a college student. An ok guide to helping improve your reading skill at a moderate cost.
1,dang it,wrong book needed 5th edition and not the teacher im a student so this does ot reallly helpo me out at all
3,"Pretty Good CD, But Not Worth The Price","There aren't very many Native American style flutists out there, and Mark Holland is one of the better ones. But his music certainly doesn't rise above and cross-over like say,Scott August's, New Fire. For Such A Time As This is one of Mark's better CDs. But its been out of print for awhile, so the prices on any CD you find, has gone through the roof. I got mine before the prices were so high. I like the CD well enough, but not enough to recommend it at these prices. Go buy 3 or 4 Scott August CDs instead. His music is more worldly, yet based in Native flutes, so still has an authentic feel. He's a true virtuoso. Mark is really good too, but I haven't yet heard anything that rises above. Maybe skip this one and get one of Mark's more reasonable priced Cds. This ones good, but not that good."
1,Item never received.,I don't know really how to rate this item because I never received it even though the payment was made by me in full. I won't order again.
3,The map errors frustrated me but otherwise good info,"This book is a pretty good alternative to the Lonely Planet (which is probably more polished but overly popular). If you are traveling in a pair, maybe one of you could carry this book. The hotels and restaurants I found to be accurate. Beware of the the inaccurate maps, however. For example, on my first day in Mexico City the completely wrong placement of a major landmark (Monument of the Revolution) threw me for a very long unnecessary walk."
3,"Half weak, half strong....","I found the first half of Anima Animus (the ""frantic"" side) a bit... weak. But it get's going in ""I was me"", and from then on it is Souxie in top form, from the menacing ""Exterminating Angel"" to the moving ""Don't go to sleep..."" By the way, tha artwork and photographs by Pierre et Gilles are worth the price of the CD."
4,"It's not Tinderbox, but it is still great","I am a Siouxsie Sioux fan of long standing; when The Banshees broke up I was sad, but given ""The Rapture"" they HAD to go. I then heard that Siouxsie & Budgie would continue with The Creatures.Wow.Okay, this is not Siouxsie's best album (I'll reserve that for Tinderbox), but this is exciting, interesting, and heavily textured music. Still following along the not-quite-Goth,not-quite- Punk, not-quite-Pop line, this album rolls off the presses strong and just keeps moving.Anything involving Budgie directly is going to have interesting percussion work and this album proves the tale. But above all else it is Siouxsie Sioux's voice that captures. After a quarter century (think about it) of singing, her voice is still strong, haunting, dramatic, and, well, sexy.If you have not tried them yet, give The Creatures a run with this album."
4,deep exploration,"an electrifying, thoroughly entertaining exploration of sound by true innovators. These songs are hypnotic and energizing."
2,The lowest rung on the creatures ladder,"The most uninspired collection of music in the creatures history. Well maybe if i was a goth/wannabe/vampire/industrial (isnt that music tired already?) fan id enjoy it. Now it's really not as bad as it sounds...it's still siouxsie so it better than anything released these days, but i was soo disappointed when i first heard it. I was so excited by erasercuts that this let me down. I was very elated when Hai was released!! There's the creatures I love (feast, boomerang and now Hai) and i cannot wait to see them next month!!! This compares (anima animus) to Superstition in the Banshees collection ...uninspired and commercial sounding, sterile and dull...and just as unlistened to by me as superstition. But hey, everybody (band) can have a downer right? Siouxsie has only been guilty of a few letdowns and even those can be pleasant compared to the majority of pop music today!"
4,Great book!,"I really enojed reading this book. It reveals an interesting historical perspective - the author writes about [sic] ""serious music"" (Classical music) during the years leading to the 1940's in America. It was fun read about his predictions about the future of classical music, and more generally music in America."
5,His best compilation,"There is not much more I can say about this man that has not been said already. It's all true. It's just frustrating that more people have not heard his music. The track ""Down by the river"" alone is worth buying this 2 disk compilation. You will see what I mean. I have listened to many guitarists, and none of the played with the same emotional intensity as Roy did. Stevie Ray Vaughan came every close. The signature of a great guitarist is what he can convey with just one note. Roy left us with that note and we will never be the same. Buy this CD, you won't regret it."
5,A Great Compilation for Guitar Blues/Rock Fans,"This album is a comprehensive compilation from one of Blues Rock's most underappreciated guitar heroes. There are shades of early Charlie Daniels on tracks 2 and three of disc 1. Fans of Jimi Hendrix will appreciate Roy's psychadellic style on some tunes. I have to question the review made by Amazon.com, because, although official reports say that Buchanan hanged himself in his jail cell by his shirt, those closest to him believe that story to be a lie. Considering the fact that the police department that arrested Buchanan will not release the names of the arresting officers, I have my doubts about their story as well."
5,Trip down memory lane,"I grew up with my Dad playing a 78 sized 33rpm of Phil Harris. Was thrilled to find this collection. It has so many classic hits, though it misses his contributions to Disney's library. Sound quality is actually pretty good, considering the age of the masters. Its perhaps not for the PC crowd--he's from a different era when things now considered unacceptable were commonplace. Keep your history in mind and enjoy the experience in the spirit it was intended. Liner notes were very educational for me."
4,old time fun,"My dad especially wanted songs from this singer, as he remembered them from long ago. To my surprise, they're pretty funny even today. Phil Harris gravelly voice and sing-song delivery make this delightful."
4,Phil Harris,"Would buy from this vendor again, did what they said they would do and thats all I ask of them."
2,Mixed emotions,"Phil Harris has a distinctive and entertainingstyle. Unfortunately, this cd is marred byseveral tracks which proselytize (gimme thatold time religion) in the most offputting way."
2,Motor Problems,"Hold on to your warranty. The manufacturer has has a lot of problems with the motor. You will know you have a problem when it starts sounding like it is about to fall apart. And repair shops are having a difficult time getting replacement motors. I've waited for three months for a replacement motor. Fortunately, the motor noise doesn't effect shaving ability, which is adequate."
5,Reconditioned the way to go.,This is my 3rd reconditioned appliance and have to say it is the only way to go. First of all let me say that one of the other reviews that suggests that it has been used is wrong. It is my understanding that the items that are reconditioned are the ones that never worked in the first place so they could not have been used by the consumer. They just had a bad connection etc. When I took this razor out of the box I could not tell it from a brand new machine. A terrific bargain!
1,"Had two of these shavers, each one only lasted 3 months","I received this shaver in June, 2004. It quit working in August, 2004. I sent it back to the factory and received a replacement in September, 2004. This second shaver quit working in December, 2004. I haven't sent it back yet for another replacement because I have no confidence in getting another shaver that will have a reasonable life. I intend to make a claim to get my money back to buy a Norelco.My previous shaver was a triple head Norelco. The Braun shave is maybe as good as the Norelco but the Norelco rotary heads provide a quicker shave with fewer passes. The Norelco battery is much better. It lasted over 3 weeks per charge for well over 7 years then started to dwindle down for then next three years.The Braun battery lasts 2 weeks per charge when new."
5,Great deal,"You just can't beat this deal. I had used a Norelco for about 4 years and I was pretty happy with it, but it would frequently scratch my neck. It was about time to get a new razor, and this Braun for $45 was far and away the best value. I checked it carefully and it looks brand new. The shave itself is terrific; I have not scratched myself once in approximately 4 weeks of use, and the shave is closer that the Norelco. The charge seems to last forever also, as I haven't had to recharge it yet. I definitely recommend this shaver."
4,Great razor but incompatible with Flex Integral Charge Base,"This razor works really well but I bought it to replace my old flex integral which was stolen at a party (yeah i know, who steals a friggin razor?). The problem is that this razor is too large to fit into the clean and charge base for the integral. I assumed that they'd make the same base for both razors but i guess the synchro's base is taller. Annoying but still a great razor."
4,Braun,Had Braun before and liked the quality. Still using product and works as good as new. Would buy another one.
3,Died in one year,"Refurbished model, battery died in one year. My wife bought a new one and it is still going. Very close shave, but not as close as the more pricer Panasonic models in the 8xxx series."
5,A bargain for an excellent shaver,"I have long known that Braun stands for quality, so I was surprised to a Braun shaver at this price. I wasn't disappointed. I have a heavy beard but tender skin; this shaver shaves me close without irritating my skin. I'd buy another from Amazon in a heartbeat."
4,"Not bad for being ""reconditioned""","I've been wanting an electric shaver for awhile, but the good ones are always so expensive. Well, this one came up as one of my Gold Box items and the price was right. When I opened the box, I could not believe this was reconditioned. It looked bran spanking new. It already was charged and ready to go, so I took it to the bathroom and gave it a test run. It gave me the closest shave I've ever had without one single nick. I love this thing."
4,Exactly met expectations,"I more or less second the overall opinion expressed in the other reviews. I tend to shave every 3 days or so, and this shaver does a creditable job of making me presentable again. Not so great with longer, sparser whiskers on the neck, and nowhere near a match for a sharp blade, but way easier to get the job done vs. a blade while watching small kids or camping. Just what I was hoping for."
2,Not ideal for thick shave,"This is my first electric shaver and there is no comparison with a razor. First of all, it takes a long time to shave and it leaves a big mess. If you have a thick shave like I do, you will need your handy gillette shaver eventually, to do the fine cleaning under the chin.I am going back to my gillette shaver."
5,"Great shaver, incredible deal!","An outstanding shaver! Before I got this, I used a Remington Microscreen 1, and after shaving with the Microscreen I'd go over my face with a blade. The Microscreen was a pain to clean, a pain to charge, and the biggest pain came from using it... the Microscreen seemed to grind and pull out stubble, then deposit the stubble back on my face. It also gave a lousy shave, and I'd have to shave with a blade after shaving with the Microscreen.But enough about the Microscreen, I replaced it with the reconditioned 7505 and now I can throw my blades away. The 7505 was indistinguishable from any new shaver, shaves as close as I got with the Microscreen AND a blade, is easy to clean, gives a ""clean"" shave (doesn't redeposit stubble on face), and after 3 weeks of ownership has yet to need to be charged (w/ daily use). And the best part of all.... it cost a trivial amount more than the Microscreen.I'd recommend this to anyone."
3,Norelco Rotary vs. Braun Foil Face-Off,"I purchased the Braun with some trepidation regarding purchasing a factory reconditioned personal care product. In fact, it looks to be in like-new good condition, with what seems to be a new foil head. I am fully confident in using it.I had been using a Norelco rotary and was curious which was better. I shaved one half of my beard with the Norelco for 90 seconds and one half with the Braun. Both seemed to do a very credible job, perhaps with a minor edge to the Braun. However, the Norelco, not being rechargeable and not having a battery, is light weight, and better for travel. Another advantage is that the sound is lower pitched. The Braun produces a loud whining noise that I find irritating, though I think this is typical of foil razors.On a Friday sale, expect to find the Braun about twenty-five percent lower than its current price. It is clearly a good value in that you will pay considerably more for a new one."
4,GREAT BUY!,This is a great buy guys! Although it is reconditioned it is hardly noticeable. I checked many other websites but nowhere did I find such a good deal.If you don't mind reconditioned items.
2,Disappointed,"When I first got the shaver it seemed to have a STRONG motor and still does. However it rattles, it's loud, I have to shave 3 times longer to do the job than previous models of Braun I've owned. I have an old worn out Braun that barely runs and still it shaves me with less passes than the new one. I even have the CLEANER set up for it. The cleaner cartridges are costly and need to be changed more frequently than I expected. Anyway, I AM a Braun fan and always will be but I think this one needs some work!"
1,"What a junk, save your money.","Absolutely junk, will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life. It simply does not shave right and it turns shaving in a torture session. I tried to work with Braun expecting maybe a mal function as it is hard to believe this device can be so bad but they just make you run in circles from one service center to another. So besides a crap product also terribe customer service. Save your money and buy a Norelco."
4,Compelling,"This is an extremely well-written account of a very unusual crime -- the killing of a banker by a farmer he foreclosed upon. It does a fabulous job of showing the monetary links between farming and banking, and of delving into the personalities involved. The story line is maybe a bit thin -- two guys killed by a father-and-son who blame the bankers for their troubles -- and the author really makes the most of it.For anyone who likes true-life, non-fiction stories, this is a good one."
5,A beautifully written book,"In this brief and lovely book, the narrator, Leo, goes on a search for his uncle, missing for fifty years. In the process, he travels back in time to depression era Kentucky, a literary device which is beautifully done and does not seem at all out of place. The author's prose is straightforward and moving in its simplicity, and themes of hardship, loss, remembrance and recovery are woven into the story in a way that stays with you. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
3,Not What I thought it would be,"I really like the first few track Et C'est Parti and Parle-moi. The others are just lack luster tracks. I don't know who produced these but I think they can be a little better with the right ear to it. I was also hoping for a little more arabic/rai music incorporated into the songs, but in general not a bad buy. I would be interested in the what she will come out with on her next album. If you truly want a slamming CD, try Gerald de Palmas Marcher dans le Sable. I almost cried to some of the songs. email me at (...)"
1,Stick to a name brand,"This plug did not work in our DS. I had purchased two for my kids and had to return them both. Worse is I gave them for Easter, and now have to pay restocking fee for them. One is not even opened. Better off buying name brand for certain items."
5,Amazing,"Unbelievable value...excellent fit, comfortable...i just wish it came in black and nude. It would be my ONLY bra."
2,Left a little to be desired,"This book could have done a little better job in giving information. If you were interested only in the best places to retire in order it is good. However, I would have liked more information than what was given."
2,I can't afford to move there,This is a book with an underlying assumption that may not be correct. Stay where you are and make the best of it. I did.
4,"There are better Amos Walker books, but its still good.","I picked this book up at a library sale with no previous knowledge of the Amos Walker novels. I have since read 6 of them. If you are a fine of private detective fiction you will enjoy these books. Amos Walker is the perfect PI, cynical, ethical to a fault, relentless, and gets beat up a lot. He also has a dry sense of humor that is reminiscent of Philip Marlowe without obviously mimicking him.This is not the best Walker mystery but it's still a good read. I have never been to Detroit, but I imagine the board tourism there is not a fan of Amos Walker, his Detroit is a gritty, dangerous and desperate place full of neighborhoods no one should visit, fantastic fiction."
5,Perfect!!,"This fuel filter was a perfect replacement for the factory filter. My only comment is that it looks completely different than the picture in Amazon. I ordered it based on the model number, which turned out to be correct."
3,A TRUE 5 STAR!!!!,"It only rated three stars due to being a reprint of an earlier publication. I was awaiting the futher adventures ( I've read the entire series) of the Rebels and unfortunately found a re-run under a different cover. Still it was exciting to read again and I still wait, although now somewhat impatiently!"
1,Boring,"Bad voice acting, and literally no story this is very hard show to watch dubbed. What was the point of this show just to beat the crap out lead male? If so it succeed, just awful."
4,Great anime so far one ep in,All the DVDs were stacked on top of each other.. Plus the little dvd clip in the middle was broken.. Then again the DVD was plastic wrapped so its the manufacturers fault.
4,REview on product not Anime itself,The DVD's come in a single sized DVD case with all six DVD's on a single spindle. I used a 6 disc case to separate the discs from being scratched pr anything else.
5,Great straps!,I used these straps for my Rola bag on a hitch mount for my cross country road trip. I checked the straps after the first 20 miles or so the first couple of times I began a new leg on our trip and there was almost no loosening at all. Great straps.
1,junk,"broke the first time I tried to use it.. and not even during use... i tightened it, then decided i wanted to open it, and it refused to... tried to open it and the handle broke in my hand... had to cut it to free my bike"
1,tie down,The straps did not stay tight. the buckles allowed the straps to slip instead of grabbing them and keeping them tight. Had to purchase an additional bungee cord.
1,Junk,These tie downs cannot be tightened. The design of the latch allows for a 1/4 inch of play. No what you want in a tie down. I own all kinds of tie downs and these are useless.
4,Great set of tie downs,"Great set of tie downs, and not a bad price. I used these in conjunction with the ""Keeper 5729 16"" Soft Tie Extension Tie-Down, 800 lbs. WLL (2500 lbs. break strength) 4 Pk"" and a wheel chock to transport my motorcycle in the back of a pickup. Worked great, and no complaints."
2,Highland 6' Cambuckle tie down,"These units (pack of 4) have very unreliable locking system for tighening straps to whatever, must be pulled extremely tight anf then tied as they slip very easily, Would not recommend for roof top traveling."
3,Not rated correctly,The text says 900 pound work load. It's only 300. Local hardware stores have them for much less if that strength is what you are looking for.
1,came loose too often,We used this to tie down the cargo bag when moving from NY to Texas and I didn't feel secure with it. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,"A good idea? A bad Idea, No just an idea",Two stars is average for the device type.The Good:Straps are well built and plenty strong.The bad:The hooks are too small to fit over the rails on most roof racks and so the hooks must be used to snag the web after being passed around the rail.The cam buckle sounds like a good idea but it is really not particularly. The latch must be depressed to tighten the strap through the buckle. Because the hook is too small and it must be looped over the strap this is more awkward than the ratchet strapThe ugly:The latch is difficult to depress.Overall in some cases a bit better than the ratchet strap but by and large not as good as the better ones.
2,Not for Airplane use!,"This is not designed for airplane use! I knew this before purchasing, but wondered how much force can air Resistance be created by 30 knots max winds?The answer is, not much, but changes in winds, will cause this to loose its functionality.I used this on my Cessna 207 and 206, and they have lasted no more than 2 months if I am lucky.Yes, they are cheap, but don't expect them to last a long time."
2,Spend a little more and buy better straps,The way the strap feeds through the buckle prevents you from actually tightening them down. Go ahead and spend a little more and get better straps. Not worth the time and headache!
3,Not Easy to Tighten.,"I purchased these to tie down my bicycles onto the Lund Cargo Carrier with bike attachments. The straps themselves are sturdy and durable, however the ""Cambuckle (press, pull tight and release) system controlled with just thumb pressure"" didn't work as well as I would have liked. It is difficult to pull tight. I called upon my old boy scout skills and lashed the tie downs with another strap to tightne them up. I recommend purchase of some ratcheting straps instead."
5,Handy Light duty tie downs.,"These are easy to use and strong. The Cambuckle lets you simply pull in the ens of the strap and it holds. Easy to use. They are not ratchet types. Those put more pressure with less force required but are harder to use. I use these to hold tarps in place, hold bikes on an RV and hold down an awning.PLUSEastLightsimplepretty strong.MinusNone really as long as you remember that these are not for the real heavy stuff."
4,Very collectible awesome set,Not only is the packaging something to behold but the classics on this set are worth whatever the price. 4 CD's of some of the best classic rock cuts from the 1st 25 years of WNEW-FM out of New York. Let's hope they decide to do this again soon!
4,First times not too bad!,"Being a christian otaku, I was completely psyched to see this book in a Family Christian Store catalog. At first, the CG'ed pages made me feel disapointed. Some of the slang seems over the top, but it seems to tone down. Serenity's ideas of God are pretty common. And just this first book is enough to pull you in. Even if it's not perfect, its certainly enough. This book is made for teens. So expect some cursing (although its edited out, but the idea is shown, Serenity see's no reason not to mouth off when she's angry)and there's also an attempt to have sex (though it doesn't get even close). Realism is a very STRONG point. And this series is very promising and IMO long awaited.Time for Christianity to break into comics! :D So check it out."
3,Christian Comic,"Serenity Harper is hard-core. She is a teenager in trouble with the law. One more mistake and she will be in jail, a fact mentioned several times. After moving to a new high school, Serenity's bad attitude cause her many trips to the principal's office. She hangs with a tough crowd. But one group of people aim to make her a better person. Derek, Kimberly, and the Prayer Club try to reach past her tough exterior to help the lonely person inside. Can they succeed?Serenity is a Christian comic book. It reads quick and easily while showing readers that they need to help others. It also shows that people just need someone to believe in them."
1,I couldnt beleive it,"I bought a ton of these books with the intention of giving them to my students. Luckily I'm a reader myself and went through the books before wrapping them as Christmas gifts.I was totally upset when I saw the use of explicit symbols in the book. IF you're looking for a clean, fun, comic....please exclude this one from your order. Some of the other books are cool, but this one, with the explicit is not the prime example."
2,Convoluted Rules/ over complicated,"I liked the idea of shadowrun very much, and once I learned how to play I enjoyed the simple runs that we had; however, the advanced aspects of shadowrun (e.g. magic, decking, rigging and vehicles, etc.) had very complicated and convoluted rules. First off, the magic section makes very little sense with regards to the drain and mana system, and the aspected magician isn't explained at all. Secondly, the Matrix uses overcomplicated rules for even simple tasks. The technical jargon used was quite confusing. Another nuisance was the shotty binding (mine plus two other books are falling apart). I reccomend waiting for the next edition to come out because of these reasons. The game is fun, just not very clear."
2,Messy and Confusing,Poorly written and a poor layout make this extremly difficult for newbies to play shadowrun. If you're new to shadowrun just pick up the shadowrun quickstart book. Hopefully FASA will do a complete revision of shadowrun in the next edition to make it more user-friendly and comprehendable to newbies and veterans alike.Hardly worth the money.
4,The Game isn't the problem,"I think that the rules in 3rd edition are limited so that yo have to buy all the books. This is especially the case with all of the third edition books gradually coming out. The worst part about this book (3rd ed) is the organization, you can't find anything and the index doesn't help"
3,Poor layout,"While the rules are solid and well thought out, the layout of this book is fairly horrible. Important rules are buried within the text, with no mention in the index. Finding a specific rule is very painful and time-consuming."
5,A CD worth playing on repeat for hours on end,"I found the second CD a little more exciting than the first. My favorite track is definitely ""RECKLESS"" Bonnie Bailey. Her voice rocks with this sexy, baby girl gravel!!! The track itself is hard, sultry, and dark!!! ""Bucci Bag"" is Brilliant as well!!! Great, fun, dance song!!! Shiny Disco Ball is another track you just can't sit still listening to!!! Of Course there is Dirty Vegas...NUFF SAID!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this compilation and thought it was overall put together magnificently!!!"
1,wtf,"i thought i ordered ruby woo, a matte red. instead i receive a brownish color. it read retro instead of ruby woo. the package it came it was torn looked like it had been re used. I order the correct color from mac which i should have done in the first place. overall horrible service. i have pictures but am not sure how to post."
3,"Shade great, but..........","Several people on pintrest suggested and bragged this was the ultimate red shade. Yes, I agree its a GREAT shade---but, it is very very dry to put on. I couldn't figure out if my tube of lipstick was old, or if that is the true texture of the product. After reading some reviews, I have come to the conclusion, the product is dry. It feels like it ""drags"" across your lips. I am disappointed in the lipstick--for the $$ paid, its not worth the money (in my opinion)."
3,"Pretty lipstick, great wearing, but not the color I hoped","This lipstick is very nice and long wearing, but was billed as a blue red and it really isn't quite blue enough for me."
2,A challenging read,"I just finished this book, having picked it up due to so many good reviews. It is a difficult book to digest - endless esoteric/multi-lingual comments, an ok plot with a somewhat predictable ending, and a hero who loves to spout off, but does little talking about why he is innocent of all the crimes of which he is accused. Obviously some people have loved it, but the one word that I would use to describe it, besides challenging, is oblique. I love historical novels, but I doubt that I will pick up another one by this author."
3,Loved the book but difficult to recommend,"As other reviewers stated, this book is excellent historical fiction. However, this is not a book for the faint of heart. The style is a complicated mix. The sentence structure varied and old english. The character and political storylines are very detailed. If you want historical fiction with a deeply written agenda you will love this book. If you want a light read, this book is not for you."
4,Recommended from the other side of the planet (NZ),"Without a chance met friend (on the internet) I would probably never have found these books. He suggested them after I sent him the words to the ""The Lady of Shalott"" and he realized what kind of stories I liked. These books are amazing in texture and emotions. What reading a good book is all about. This book gets 4*'s only because it turns so many people away from the series. This is the only book in the series where she uses so many different language the rest of the books are so much easier in comparison. When you get through book 4 you are willing to forgive her everything. When you finish book 6 you immediately what to start all over again. In the casting game for Francis Crawford I would like to enter Paul Bettany."
5,Romantic Chess,"The imagery and imagination of Dorothy Dunnett make her characters believable yet fantasmic. The Game of Kings is a saga full of mystery and love, making it the only historical fiction novel written in the past fifty years I would recommend to both men and women. Mrs. Dunnet's view of the 16th century is beautiful yet real. Her plot is as suspensful as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and as heartbreaking as Margaret Mitchell. Her hero is both Sir Galahad and Rhett Butler. A mixture of medieval symbolism and modern day realism.Every person who enjoys historical fiction, from Leo Tolstoy to Eugenia Price, will love Dorothy Dunnett's The Game of Kings."
5,Peerless.,"The first in Lady Dunnett's famous Lymond chronicles (a 6-book series), Game of Kings layers historical detail, humor, action, psychological insight, occult overtones and just plain silliness (the drunken hog!) onto a tightly-written background of Renaissance Scotland and England. The characters display a fascinating ability to live full, ethically complex lives while remaining true to themselves and their codes of honor. Francis Crawford is a hero to name your child after, and Philippa is nearly as charismatic and fully-realized. I first read this book almost 30 years ago, and I've read it repeatedly since then -- it's worth it."
2,I don't understand the great reviews....,"I wanted to like this book. I really really did. I bought the entire series based on the reviews (if that tells you how much I expected to like the book). I plow through 2 or 3 books weekly. This 1 book took me almost 3 weeks to read. It's a difficult read - in both story line and old English style writing - and by the end of the book I felt like I only got the basic gist of what was going on. In fact, she basically summarizes the book in the last chapter. I'm not someone who can stop reading a book that I've started even when I don't like it, so if I had known that from the beginning, I would have simply read that and put the book away."
2,Not worth the anguish,"Although I have a great appreciation for historical fiction, I am really floored by sentences such as: ""Twelve crowns for a teazle o'Tay sand and chopped henbane and a week's rakings from the doocote!"" (page 37) Excuse me! Writing like this-probably a fine representation of the Scottish dialect of that period-is still painful to trudge through and turned a relaxing read into a headache!"
2,I kept waiting for this book to get good,"I have to agree with the reviewers who have rated this book poorly. It was so boring. I truly kept waiting for the book to get good because I really wanted to like it. I finally put it down with 50 pages left -- at that point I knew it was not getting any better. I was actually relieved to start a new book. The Game of Kings is not worth the time, money, or painstaking effort."
2,still struggling on...and on...,"I am still strugeling through the second or third chapter and I feel dumb! I am an avid lover of historical works, but this is just beyond me. Dunnett's writing is so convoluted and lengthy I can't tell what is going on from page to page. At one point Lymond and his sister-in-law spent two pages on an argument, I had no idea untill the end when the woman feels bad for their fight, what fight? where? This book only suceeds in making the reader feel inferior, I'm constantally left with the impression that major things are going on and being said, but I just don't quite get it... I'm giving up and going back to the real Scottish hero...Jamie in the Outlander Series."
2,Must be a polyglot to enjoy this book,"Although Ms. Dunnett clearly understands the time period in which this story takes place, her ability to use her large knowledge base to make an enjoyable reading experience for the reader is lacking. The writing is so full of arcane French, Latin and Olde English references that she may be the only person who can fully understand it. It was so annoying to have to keep skipping over these long rambling passages and conversations. I have a postgraduate degree and am an avid reader of historical fiction and still found that I simply had to ignore a great deal of the book. The only explanation I have is that Ms. Dunnett was attempting to impress the reader rather than entertain him. I have no intention of reading any of the remainder of this series."
1,"I agree: ""Huh?!""","I'm a historical fiction buff, and I got so excited by all these rave reviews of the Lymond Chronicles, I bought the whole series. I'm less than 100 pages into ""Game of Kings"" and I believe I've never read anything more bo-ring in my life. With all the flowery language and multi-lingual quoting, I still haven't a clue as to WHAT is going on, and not one of the characters, not even the infamous Lymond, has been able to hold my interest. I'm going to stick it out with ""Game""...but I have a feeling I'll be trekking back to the post office with the other five books. Oh well. Can't please everyone. Vive la difference."
2,Too confusing,"I don't like to give bad reviews but... I couldn't follow this book- and I gave up about 30% into it. I read other reviews that said not to give up, it gets better, so I tried...but I just couldn't spend anymore time trying to figure out what the heck they were talking about. I got frustrated and quit. I'm not sure who I could recommend this series to but if you can follow it, I envy you."
5,"""Lymond is back""","I'm officially addicted. Francis Crawford of Lymond is the most intriguing and intelligent protagonist I've ever encountered. Written beautifully (sometimes difficultly, with multiple languages, but don't let this discourage you!), and the plot is absolutely engrossing.I found myself breaking lunch plans, or leaving a friend's house early, just to get back to this book. I have no idea why the goodreads description classifies it as ""romance"" -- nothing in this story would warrant that label (maybe in the later books?). I've already rushed to the library to pick up the second book in the series and I can't wait to get into it."
5,Lymond is fascinating,"I became interested in Dorothy Dunnett's books by accident - I bought a used book at an English book store in Aix-en-Provence. It was the first book in the Niccolo series. And it sent me looking for her Lymond series of books. These books have everything - war, romance, adventure, culture, intrigue, history, religion, puzzles - you really have to pay attention to what you're reading because she doesn't spell everything out for you. Often there are only hints and these only become clear later - or maybe even in a later book in the series. The characters are some of the best drawn I have ever encountered in historical fiction - or any fiction. After reading the Lymond series, I feel I know Lymond and some of his contemporaries as well as anyone in my life. I highly recommend these books - I only wish I knew someone who has read them so that I could discuss them with someone!"
3,NOT Patrick O'Brian,"I ordered this Dorothy Dunnett book, the first in a trilogy, because she has been so favorably compared to Patrick O'Brian, one of my all-time favorite authors. Good story however I find her annoyingly arrogant in her extensive use of French and Latin passages that are not translated for non-French/non-Latin speaking people, such as I. It is disruptive to the flow of the story to stumble upon such passages & it certainly detracts from the full understanding of the event about which Dunnett is writing.I will however read the other two books of the trilogy."
5,A life changing experience,"At the very impressionable age of 18 I read all six Lymond books in one summer holiday. Twenty two years later I still regularly re read them.Like other reviewers, I was (once I had mastered Dorothy Dunnett's complex style) completely mesmerised by this epic achievement. By the end of ""Checkmate"" I was just about passing out with the suspense of it all. Memorable characters and scenes, beautiful language and convoluted plots make this series a challenging and richly rewarding experience. My favourite moments in ""Game of Kings""? The rescue of Will Scott from Berwick castle, the duel between Francis and Richard (and their scarifying verbal duels which follow) and the trial scenes. Thankyou Dorothy. PS - If you like these books, try Dorothy L. Sayers' Peter Wimsey mysteries, particularly the ones featuring Harriet Vane. Lord Peter is Francis Crawford with a monocle!"
1,Rediculous propaganda,"If you are looking for a right wing non-scientific backlash against environmentalism here is a book for you. The ""common Sense"" in the title must have been an editorial mistake for this book has very little of it. Having been involved in the environmental arena for 16 years I have seen my share of eco-nuts, however this books angle is nuttier that the whole lot of them. But then again cancer and garbage are good for the economy."
2,Will the truth please stand up,"This is an old book and much of it sounds like Bill O'Reilly does enviromentalism. Is it right, I don't know. It doesn't match with current thought but it quotes lots of scientific evidence in support of its position.Read it and decide for yourself. For what its worth, I didn't like it's hectoring tone."
1,Anti-environmental anti-science,"The worst inditment of our school systems is that anyone would mistake this nonsence with science. Ray uncritically took material from the most unreliable sources imaginable (Lyndon LaRouche associates,the John Birch Society) and added her own mistakes. A waste of trees."
5,Changed my Life,"I had this book as a required text in college about 10 years ago. At the time I was young and unfortunatly very much convinced that the government had solutions to our problems. This book made me realize how much I had been duped by the socialist propaganda of mainstream media. Don't get me wrong, I did not become an instant ""right winger"". In fact, it made me conclude that I did not know much and needed to start from scratch and throw out all my old assumptions. I decided to subscribe to The New Republic(left), The conservative Chronical(right) and Reason (Libertarian). After a year of reading these publications from cover to cover, I realized that the Libertarian philosphy actually held the answers our society desperatly needs to actually succeed in resolving issues like environmental neglect or abuse. My point is, it was this book that made me realize I had basically been brainwashed my whole life through the network news. SO it really holds a special place in my heart."
2,Nothing Special,"The good folks at Relix Records seem to feel that every possible FBB concert should be released on CD, regardless of the quality of the particular performance (rather like the Grateful Dead). There is nothing about this show which makes it worthy of having been recorded, let alone released as a CD. Neither John Beland nor Gib Guilbeau were around for this one, so we have Sneaky Pete, Skip Battin, Greg Harris, and Jim Goodall slogging their way through a mixture of Burrito and Byrds numbers and a few old country standards, doing justice to none of them. This disc contains nothing more than a lame, half-hearted performance by a second-rate lineup. This one is for completists only."
1,Myth or Myth? you be the judge,This book has no scientific proof of exisitence nor validity. Purely speculation and guess work seemingly based upon one persons viewpoint and assumptions made thereof. I would not take this book seriously nor read in in any other manor than to fall asleep at night!
4,A good intro in Blavatsky's work,"this version of Isis unveiled in abridged form is a good iniciation into the mystical words of blavatsky. Although it is not complete, and for full information one should read the full version of Isis unveiled this book is a good introduction. Also it has the advantage of bringing some words closer to modern world ideas, in a kind of way ""translating"" the book in a modern way."
4,Review,I really liked the reading of this book when I heard it being read on youtube.com. The highlights of the book intreged me. This will supplement my studies about religion and society.The downside is it took to long for it to be shipped. I was almost worried.
2,Poor Edition,"The text itself is outstanding, but the this edition is incomplete. The Table of Contents had no titles listed for each chapter, nor did it list page numbers. There was no preface or introduction or index, which other editions do have.I should have been tipped off by the ethnically incorrect image of Isis on the cover. I was seduced by the price.I am returning this for the hardcover edition. $10 more, but worth it because it contains the access tools to the massive content covered in these volumes."
1,Please read this before you buy this game!,"OK, let me start by saying that I'm a sucker for cover art. If it looks cool, I'm all over it. So, I bought this game under the impression it might be kinda like the PS2 version. Not even close! Let me start at the beginning...1. Music: 1/2 starI don't even know why they bothered with music- it's boring and repetitive.2. Graphics: 1 starThe DS is capable of a LOT better graphic than this game has-take Mario Kart, for example.3. Controls: 2 starsA little touchy, but I suppose they just take some getting used to.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the riders look pretty good, and you can customize them a lot. But other than that, the graphics look like Majesco tried to make them in a week. Seriously. It's really pathetic. I highly advise you save yourself the agony of this game and go but something like Mario Kart or Castlevania (good games!) because ATV Quad Fury is an insult to gamers everywhere."
1,Probably the worst game I have ever played,"I would actually rate this game at a 1/2 star, it is that bad. The graphics are horrible, the DS is capable of much better detail. It would be easier to tell you what is good about the game than to list every problem.Good:NOTHING!Bad:Sound, Graphics, Physics, Camera, Control, Music.....you get the idea.Avoid this game, even for $5.00"
5,Chariots of Fire a true classic.,"Hugh Hudson directed an almost flawless film. Winner of 4 Oscars says it all. I hadn't watched ""Chariots of Fire"" in years, but that opening scene of the young men running in the surf brought back fond memories from the first time I saw it in the theaters. We could all use a little bit of the drive and ambitions of those athletes."
1,What were they thinking!,It is astounding to me that the people at Warner Bros. could have so little respect for this movie as to not have a letterbox option on this DVD.
5,Classic - Inspired,"this film is a wonderful evocation of an era and is brilliant in it s conception, acting and directing. the music is perfect and the opening sequence of the athletes running is superb. this hsould be shown over and over in schools."
3,this should have been a better DVD!,"This movie was one of my favorite films from the eighties--a great cast, a wonderful story (especially since it was based on fact!), and exquisite care in the production values. So, how come Warner Brothers couldn't produce a better DVD of ""Chariots of Fire""? I'm especially disappointed because this is the same studio which brought us the superb DVD of ""L.A. Confidential"" (the best movie of the nineties). This movie (as well as ""Local Hero""--also a Warner Brothers product!) cries out for a widescreen presentation and instead, we get a film that could have been recorded from a premium cable channel. Still, I give it 3 stars, because it is a fine movie--maybe we'll get a re-mastered film in the next century?"
5,A must have for your library,"A classic sports movie that focuses on two UK runners as they prepare for the Paris Olympics, one is a Jew and one a Christian who holds firm in his conviction that Sunday is the Lords day and he will not run on the Lord's day, even to compete in his event in the Olympic games. I have seen this movies hundreds of times and it was time to upgrade from VHS to DVD. I loved all the interviews and the making of. I was especially impressed with the training these actors did to ""become"" runners."
4,If only I had a widescreen-someday...,"The movie just has to get a great review for its cinematography, its wardrobe and setting and even if I'm not a big fan of a synthesizer I realize it was released in 1980. The drive and passion are as much yours as they are the characters when this great piece of art is done with you and the similarities and contrasts are especially thought provoking. My only regret, aside from the synthesizer is the seemingly anamorphic screen but even that is forgotten a little way into the film. I figure however that someday when I have a nice widescreen TV it will be all I could hope for. If you've never seen it, do so with a mind to look beyond a 100 meter dash. What binds a man, what frees a man, and what really makes him fly?"
2,Chariots of Fire,"Very disappointed. Slow, dragged on, never really felt like it got to an exciting climax. Kept waiting for it to ""pick up"". ;("
2,almost as exciting as watching golf on tv,"ok, i have an admission to make: i have always said this is one of the most boring movies ever made, but i never actually saw it til now. not that i didnt pay my way into the theater because i did. but i fell asleep after 20 minutes or so and never actually SAW the movie. now i have. worse movies have won the oscar: ""gandhi"", ""kramer vs kramer"", ""the english patient"", maybe a few more. but i dont think theres ever been a duller movie. that said, i gave it 2 stars instead of one to honor the all-too-brief shots of dennis christopher who was dreamycreamy back then, but is only on screen about 5 minutes. frankly, i found the two ""heroes"" to be a pair of self-centered religious zealots, and prigs to boot. and god, i loathe that vangelis music that played constantly for the decade after the movies release. my gawd, this thing beat ""reds"" for a best picture oscar?!?!? maybe i shall go back and take away the second star ..."
5,My favorite movie of all time!,My favorite movie of all time!Everyone was well chosen.It is a perfect film.
1,"Excellent movie, terrible DVD","This is one of my all time favorite movies, that I finally purchased on DVD and expected so much, but got so little. The DVD quality is terrible, and the special features are screwy. I am especially disappointed that it does not provide an option to play the movie with subtitles. I am disgusted I wasted my money, what a shame that Warners Brothers would fail so miserably on such an outstanding movie classic."
3,"great movie, poor picture quality","The movie is a classic and worth watching. We rented it during the 2012 olympics. The HD is questionable, picture was grainy at best."
3,We Need Widescreen,"What the heck? Best PictureAward, fabulous panoramics,ship scenes, great sport shots - in full screen???? Yuck. I am waiting for the widescreen version of this classic sports movie before I pluck down my cash. Then we see 5 stars. Awesome movie - please give us the full effect."
2,Disappointing Format,"This is a great film, but I cannot recommend it on DVD until it is re-released in letterbox (hence the 2 stars). Full format destroys the look of the film by blurring the races and jerking the viewer back and forth between the characters. Hopefully this will be corrected soon and I can buy it!"
3,A Wonderful Film...But the DVD is Another Story...,"I am a recent initiate to this glorious movie and have enjoyed it many times on video, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had been released on DVD. That pleasure was soon deflated as I read that this film was NOT formatted for widescreen viewing. I was speechless. Such a richly filmed and acted movie like this deserves to be presented in widescreen but for whatever reason such is not the case. I thought one of the main benefits of DVD was the widescreen format, but I guess that only applies to movies that deserve it(?). Tragic..."
1,chariots of fire,I don't understand why a studio would release any film(especially one like this) in standard format. It was sobeautiful in wide screen. I was very disappointed. Iwould rather remember my theater experience and pass onwatching a compromised version.
2,I hope that someone out there hears our opinions,It is truly sad that WB did not deem it worthwhile to put this movie into a widescreeen DVD format. I hope that someone from that company with influence hears how displeased the fans of the movie are and does something about it.
1,Is the widescreen version lost forever?,"This is one of my favorite films. Luckily, I got to see it twice on the big screen during its original release. Where is the widescreen version of this film??? Are the suits at WB afraid to admit they've lost it - an Academy Award winner for ""Best Picture""?"
4,not totally family friendly,"I would give this a five-star rating if it were not for the 2nd cd. Not only does it lack information about Ian Charleson (who died in 1990), but it also contains a comment by Ben Cross that is totally inappropriate for the audience the film is intended for. You will be embarrassed if you are watching it with your family, like I was. I would recommend another version of the movie."
4,Love this movie!,"I've wanted a copy of Chariots of Fire for a long time, so I was thrilled to get this one. The quality was fine, although very dark at times, hence the 4 stars. It was really fun to see interviews with some of the stars and get their take on being involved in this project. I'm really glad I purchased this movie."
4,A good story well acted and memorable music.Well worth viewing,An excellent classic British sporting movie with a great cast supplying top performances and a memorable musical score byVangelis.
4,Oldie but Goodie,A timeless story of good triumphs over the lackadaisical. Always worth the viewing just to restore faith in humankind. Good.
5,Timeless Classic,Chariots of Fire is truly one of the most inspiring and magical films of all time. Scenes in this movie make me tear up every viewing.
1,Digging Dirt in Slow Motion,"A soporific movie that seems to drag on forever. One scene summarizes the movie perfectly: in preparing for a race, one of the stars is shown digging into the dirt in slow motion (starting blocks didn't exist in the 1920's).I'd recommend this movie to those who have trouble sleeping but want to avoid sleeping pills."
1,Makes me sleepy just thinking about it.,"I'm sorry to say that I have fallen dead asleep in the theatre twice in my life. Watching this film caused one of these ""napping"" incidents. This is without a doubt the most boring film ever made. And its waaaay to long to boot! A deadly combination."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"When I saw this in the theater, not willingly mind you, I fell asleep for a good amount of the movie. This is the most boring movie in the history of film!!! I just don't understand what makes this film oscar worthy! Look at some of the other movies that have won -- they weren't boring! but for one year I guess the academy decided to give the award to the most boring movie of the year if not of the century.I tried to watch this again when I was much older, being 13 years old the first time, I didn't take it too seriously. I just used it as a sleeping aid. I still thought it was dreadfully boring even 20 someodd years later. It's a movie about nothing but some english chaps running, and running and running...run away from this one. Don't let the Oscar nod sway you, it was a bad year for Oscar that year."
1,Yuck.,There were no chariots and there was no fire. This is really bad and amateurish stuff. Get a Seagal movie instead.
5,5 Stars for the movie - 3 stars for the quality,"I love this movie. It is truly inspirational and it made a tremendous impression on me the first time I saw it- an impression that has lasted to this day.I had read a review saying that this dvd was ""grainy"" and I was quite surprised to find this to be true. It is certainly not unwatchable, but I do think it should have been possible to produce some sort of remastered version with improved visual quality.Still, I'm happy to own it. I recommend this dvd because of the movie itself, not it's visual quality or lack thereof."
3,Essential in Letterbox,"It is inexcusable that a film such as this was released in full-screen format. The cinematography in the letterbox version of this movie is simply incredible, along with some excellent dialogue shots. The effect of this 4:3 pan and scan release is to distract you from the beauty of the heather and the majesty of the scenes captured in the original release.As for the movie, it is an exceptional tale of two men and how they approach their time in the Olympic games. One sees his running as an extension of his faith, the other as a vehicle for his consuming need to win. It is truly a great movie!"
3,Where's the widescreen version,Chariots of Fire is available in Europe (Region 2) on a widescreen DVD. Why is it still not available in the U.S. (Region 1)?
3,Great movie! Poor DVD,"This truly is a great film and worthy of the Best Picture nod it got in 81', however, please beware that this is a full screen edition. To my knowledge, no letterbox edition has been released! The sparse bonus material (production notes, the trailer and cast profiles) only add insult to injury. Considering it even won an award for best Cinematography (New York Film Critics), the full screen presentation seems inexcusable. Come on Warner Brothers, treat your treasures with some respect!That said, the transfer is acceptible, but the sound could use some work. Hard to understand the dialogue in some places. All in all, it's still a great film and worth watching. It just seems a shame we cant see it as it was meant to be."
4,One of the best of the 80s,"A true classic is something you watch again and again and the enjoyment never diminishes. I loved this when it came to the theatres, truly a ""class"" production that evoked a time when you could use ""athlete"" and ""gentleman"" in the same sentence without snickering. The story takes some minor liberties with the facts, of course, but the actors playing Eric Liddell (the missionary from Scotland) and Harold Abrahams (the likable but hypersensitive Jewish rich kid) capture the historical characters and do them justice. When you sour on the trashy sitcoms and reality shows, cleanse your palate with this engaging film about a different time and place, with characters you can root for, splendid photography, the catchy music by Vangelis, and some of the best actors ever assembled for one film."
1,The BEST film of the 80's/The WORST DVD of the century!,"It is a DISGRACE that Warners would treat a BEST PICTURE winner in this fashion. Why the poor transfer to DVD? Why not put the film onto DVD in its original aspect ratio (widescreen), as it was meant to be seen? Both The Sting (Universal) and Driving Miss Daisy (also Warners) are two other best picture winners which received the same sorry treatment. I will NEVER buy the DVD of this EXCELLENT film until a proper release is given."
2,"DVD terrible, Film Excellent","What a disappointment. This Oscar-winning film about the triumph of the human spirit deserves much better treatment than the lousy DVD that was put out.The picture quality is terrible, with lots of artifacts, and there's no widescreen, no goodies, and the sound is not good -- tragic, especially when the hymn ""Jerusalem"" should soar to the rafters. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of themselves. If I could return my copy I would.5 stars for the excellent film, 0 stars for the lousy execution of the DVD."
5,An inspiring and beautiful example of cinematic storytelling....,"Though I could hum the theme from this film, for many years, I didn't have the opportunity to watch it (on DVD) until now. Based on a true story, we see the triumphant story of Abrahams and Liddell, two young athletes who started their journey on the track, at University, and ended up sprinting their way to the Olympic Games. Abrahams (Ben Cross) is a British-born Jew of Lithuanian extraction, who seeks to prove his loyalty and pride, as a Brit, fierce competitor and track champion. Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Divinity student and is torn between his commitment to evangelism and his God-given gift of speed on the track field.This film is gorgeously filmed, beautifully acted and rich with top flight showmanship. They truly do not make films like this anymore."
3,A Nice Film,"It is very difficult to rate this film. The Cinematography, Set Design, Art Direction, and Costume Design, are all top quality. The overall quality of the film, however, is not as good as these individual factors. First and foremost, this is a very good story, but it was made far to long! 124 minutes may seem reasonable, but when all you're seeing is the same simple story, it gets boring. Had they either made it shorter, or had a more complex story, it would have been much better. Next, one mustn't forget the acting. The two actors (whose name's escape me) that played Abrahams and Liddell were fine. Ian Holm, however, was pathetic. How he managed to extract an Oscar Nomination from his pitiful performance is beyond me. He reacted to things to slowly: it appeared he was trying to be subtle, but failed miserably.All and all, this is a good movie to rent and enjoy, but it's no epic and it will never be a classic."
1,Hard to follow,"I found this film extremely hard to follow. The accents are so ""thick"" it is difficult to understand the dialog. Also, there are several main characters and flashbacks, we all had trouble keeping the characters straight. If you're looking for a good sports movie, skip this one and watch MoneyBall."
5,I give it a 10!,"""I believe god made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast, and when I run I feel his pleasure.""Man I got chills at the end when he said that. Trully one of the very few epic movies of the 80's. Great film."
2,It's called WIDESCREEN!!!,"This is one of the finest films ever made, bar none. Why for the love of all that is decent and holy will they not put out a WIDESCREEN version of this DVD?!?! As it is, I have seen, but not purchased this fullscreen formatted DVD. I will hang on to my VHS widescreen presentation. Come on Warner....give us a WIDESCREEN version we can be proud of; that is the least this awesome movie deserves!"
5,Inspiring movie!!,I've watched Chariots a number of times over the years and the quality of the Blu-ray is excellent. The soundtrack never sounded better and the picture is crystal clear. Being an olympic year I just felt the urge to get the BD version for my library. Satisfied customer!!
2,give me widescreen or give me death!!!,I agree with the above reviewer; I thought DVDs were supposed to offer a choice of TV and letterbox? A boneheaded choice obviously made by someone who doesn't care about the film.
3,Chariots of Fire,"I watched this movie on my Kindle Fire, the quality was great. The movie.... it was ok. I love the history (based on true story) but it was slow and long."
5,I can see why it's a classic!,"This was a very inspiring movie. I think this is impressive because I am American, and this movie has little to do with America. When the movie first started up, and ""Chariots of Fire"" started playing, I got goosebumps. Vangelis did a good job creating that track. I very much enjoyed the theme of faith and how it played out in the film. The characters were easy to relate to, although the time the movie was set in (the 1920's, I believe) took a little getting used to. The head of Cambridge actually said that Olympians were supposed to be amateurs! My how things have changed in 90 years. Having experienced the movie, I would gladly go back and rent it again. At the very least, watch it to see what all these Chariots of Fire references are pointing to!"
3,Interesting,"I found this movie to be quite interesting. It is a beautiful film--its cinematography shows the beauty of the European setting, and the costumes and set designs are exquisite. The story was a bit too cerebral to be any inspiration to me. Sure, it was nice to see Harold and Eric win their races, but it just didn't have the same power as other sports movies like ""Rocky"" or ""The Natural."" Of course, I may have been prejudiced before seeing it, since it won the Best Picture Oscar over two of my very favorite movies, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""On Golden Pond."" I give it three and a half stars (it doesn't quite acheive four star status, but three stars seems too low too)."
1,Unusable - returned to sender.,"DVD was received in timely manner, but the first time that I tried to play it, my screen displayed""Disc cannot be played"". Article was returned to the sender, but as of this date no refund hasbeen received,"
4,manual,Was what I expected. No surprises are a good thing when dealing online. I will do it again if needed.
3,A Good Idea,"I honor the effort and heart the writer of this book put into it. For my personal taste I found it a bit long, depressing & scattered. On the upside I was reminded it is very important to plan carefully for your retirement. The elders in this book are so humble. I feel bad for the ones who are neglected, whose families never visit or take interest in them. **Elders are the gems of our communities.** A little love goes a long way. Please take the time today to take interest in an elder in your life."
4,Quintessential Kessler,"This book was in classic Ronald Kessler form -comprehensive and detailed, and guaranteed to hold the reader's interest. However, also following Kessler form, it did contain parts which were, while true, somewhat sordid. While ignoble and shocking at times, a must read for the mature spy/Cold War buff."
5,This is the best biochemistry book (easy and comprehensive),"I love this book on biochemistry simply because it was the easiest to read, with diagrams and pictures even dumb people like me can read (gg). I also found that it is very comprehensive also. Some of the other titles I've read on the subject (Lippincott, Harper's) did not go into the detail of this one. Another positive note is that this is a clinical book also; giving you case studies in each chapter to test your knowledge. I can't say enough about this book and even referred it to one of my friends. Although not required in Chiropractic College (Lippincott was), it should have been the standard."
2,Alfie great. Rest of production not so much.,"I bought because I love La Boheme and I love Alfie Boe. But Mimi does not once look him in the face during the entire production. She looks away from him the entire time!!! Come on, it's not like Alfie's hard on the eyes or anything. I just could not get over how totally unconnected she was from the role. Totally ruined it for me."
3,NOT for Beginners,"This book, even though is intended for beginners, misses the mark. It is beautifully bound, has great illustrations, and well-made audio tracks (that are actually helpful), but skips to far-too-complicated music-playing almost immediately.Basically, I think this book is intended for someone who has played bass in a band for 10 years, and then wants to switch to lead guitar. Yes, that person is a ""beginner,"" but realistically they already have a solid foundation."
4,Great book for a beginner guitarist,"I purchased this book after taking an ""inside look"" at the material through Amazon and reading the great reviews. I've had the book for a few weeks and I am just taking my time going through the material at my own pace. I am a complete novice to the guitar and found this book very straight-forward and simple to read and use. Audio CDs are helpful, but not always necessary.I will note that I have a piano background, so reading the actual notes probably came faster to me than someone who is unfamiliar with music.The practice melodies and songs are simple, yet engage the student in mastering the fingering and notes. The explanations of all the nuances in reading sheet music are very helpful for future reference. I think the pace of the book is slow enough for a beginner to really learn how to play and not get overly frustrated.Great price and fast shipping were a plus too!"
4,Very good for beginner but a little slow on the up swing,This is a great product for learning the guitar from the beginning. Very thorough and the CD's really help. I believe a DVD would have made it more complete though. Maybe something to show you a few quick chords or easy song to keep you excited about learning more.
4,Great guitar instruction,"This is a great instruction book. I have some experience playing guitar so the beginning instruction was a little basic, but it still has a lot of good material. This book is perfect for the beginner!"
4,Excellent companion for the beginner,My child's guitar teacher recommended this book and it is excellent for the beginner. Very clear and simple to follow.
1,not good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,good at showing the chords .the cds were not helpful at all no explanations just music nothing else no notes or pictures
3,Hal Leonard Guitar Method - Complete Edition,"As far as method books go, this one is not bad. I still recommend individual/group lessons if you hope to advance. But all in all, not a bad book for the beginner."
5,Great Start,"The 3 book/3 CD compilation of the HL Guitar Method is where I began and what I use to teach students how to master the guitar and to become... musicians. The book methodically relys on learning to read actual music (later in the book the tab method is introduced) and slowly, patiently develops the student's fingers, ears, and appreciation of harmony and melody. Theory is introduced ever so subtley and enjoyably.The CD tracks are excellent and make quality self-study feasible. Many of the songs or exercises are presented in slow and up tempo versions.This is a treasure chest for the teacher and student or the student who is teaching himself. There are excellent supplemental books (pop and rock melodies, rhythm books, riff and lick books, etc.)and I recommend them all."
4,Excellent teaching tool for young and teen guitar students,"If you have a guitar student who is in the age range of ten to thirteen, the Hal Leonard Complete Edition is an excellent tool for getting young students to understand the basics of note reading, song composition, and many different rhythm types. This complete edition also provides the student with examples of basic scale types and chords. This book does not provide much information on music theory though. For a great music theory book check out the Berklee Music Theory Book 1."
5,Great for a beginner adult,I am adult beginning guitar player and I purchased this book as a supplement to the book my instructor required. I really like this book. It is a great introduction for those who don't know the names of the strings or how to play notes and chords. I highly recommend the book for a new student wanted to start with the basics to learn guitar.
3,good,"the book is pretty good. I just think that the cd is not very helpful. You play along with it, but I think it could have a demonstration of what you're supposed to play first, then have the song to play along. But overall it is a good method."
5,Best Beginning Guitar Method,After teaching guitar for over 36 years I have found that this method works better over all than any of the methods out there. I have used all the methods out and this one works best for young students who are learning to read music and those who already know how. If you are teaching an adult who knows how to read I would recommend a different method but this one is the choice for youth.
3,Hal Leonard Guitar Method Book,I purchased this book for my grandson to use to help learn how to play the guitar that I also purchased and hopefully it will be helpful for him.
5,A Great Book for Beginning Guitarists,"Santa got this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. She's had a guitar for about two years now, and this book is finally giving her some direction for learning to play it. She looks forward to learning new things, and she expects to finish this book (books 1, 2 and 3) by the time she turns 13. I've tried teaching her on my own without a book, but we both got frustrated and stopped trying after a while. This book keeps her from getting mad at me when she's learning, because she's learning more from the book than me, and it's kind of pointless getting mad at a book. I just cheer her on when she learns a new exercise and I give her some gentle suggestions once in a while. She's doing great, and this book really helps. In a few weeks we should be playing ""Ode to Joy"" together!"
4,"Amazing method, finally I am making progress","I was so furstrating when I start self-learning to play guitar after getting some lessoons from a teacher, but I am really making a progress by using this book as I start playing music notes gradually."
3,Guitar Method Complete Edition,"I thought I was saving money getting this book off the internet. But it turns out this is an earlier version, and it is slightly different than the newer versions, which has made it a bit harder to follow along with the instructor in my guitar class. Anyway, it's an OK product, but it would have been nice to know that there was more than one ""Complete"" version out there. Live and learn."
5,Solid introduction,"Probably at this time, I will not add more to previous numerous reviews. But let me state briefly this: before I decided to go through the ""Guitar Method"", I had been just a casual, rather primitive player striking chords selected from ""chords finder"". I must say, this book made me a true solid beginner, able to read notes on the staff, use a fingerstyle, understand tablature and chords construction (just a few things among many). I continue progressing using other Hal Leonard books by practicing daily. These books motivate!!"
2,Don't Be Fooled by the high reviews,"I could not wait to get this book. I wanted to learn the guitar, or at least get to the point where I could take lessons and have some prior knowledge of the guitar. I should say that I have no musical education and never played an instrument. The book goes into musical symbols and notes. If you never read music you never will following these instructions. By page 12 he has you playing Ode to Joy, please! Your lucky to know which hole the music comes out of.After going to other book stores I can say there are much better sources to teach you the basics of playing the guitar. Also, you and go to the internet and find much better ( free) lessons that will giver you the very basics that will get you on the way.Don't make the same mistake that I did, pass on this book if you are looking for a beginner instructional book. If your a music teacher like some of the reviewers are, then maybe this is for you!"
1,disappointed!,"I bought this book for my daughter's guitar lessons. She has been taking them for two months and she has been doing very well. Unfortunately, pages 15-30 are missing from her book and we just now realized it since she just got to page 15. We are passed the point of being able to return the book, but now I guess I have to buy another one and hope it has all the pages. I am very disappointed!"
5,Great Value,"This is an awesome deal for the beginning guitar player. I could already read music, but if you can't, it has a few pages dedicated to teaching you how to read the notes on a staff. This is a pretty good book to slowly learn the techniques and sounds of the guitar. I have gone through all three books and I can say I am a much more proficient player than I was before, when I was just trying to play guitar tabs online. I definitely recommend these books for anyone who wants to learn the guitar."
4,Great book for the Not So Beginner,"Ths book is very well formatted. Great spiral bond binding. It starts off with basic materials that is essential to a very new beginner but as you progress to later books and even chapters, it gets a little difficult to comprehend without having prior music theory knowledge. But overall this is a very imformative book to have in your library collection. Definitely worth the price on Amazon."
5,great for a beginner,"I've had this book less than a week and am a total beginner when it comes to the guitar.PROStarts with a basic intro to music notation.Proceedes to instructin 3 notes on the first string, then adds three notes on the second string, etc.Emphasizes initial accuracy, speed comes later.Each lessons builds on and incorporates previous lessons.This ""complete"" edition incorporatesthe three previously stand alone editions and CD's for a great cost savings.CONNone that I could see.Be aware that the CD's, so far, are audio only. I'll edit this post later if that changes."
4,Good but Mel Bay is better.,"Good guitar book, but the Mel Bay 1st and 1b books I bought a few weeks later is easier to follow and learn from."
4,Hal Leonard Guitar Methad,Just started but so far good - however could used a little more vedio instructions on proper way to fret and pic/play the strings.
4,Alexander's new book,My 9 yr old has now been practicing with this book and he has been enjoying playing the songs. I like the idea that it contains CDs so that the songs can be heard.
5,Gives teachers a head start!,I've found that the years of experience Will Schmid has have given me a head start with understanding how to teach my new students the basics of guitar playing and understanding.
5,GREAT book,This book is wonderful for a beginner to intermediate who has had no formal training. VERY useful.
5,Great Gift,"I got this book, along with a guitar for her birthday and she was very happy with both! She reports that the book is well-organized and easy to follow in her efforts to learn to play the guitar. This was money well spent."
3,"Good book, but mine was incomplete","Like most reviewers, I found this to be a very effective book for learning guitar. Unfortunately, my book happened to be missing 20 pages from the middle. This amounted to about half of ""book 2"", so I ended up going back and buying that book separately later on. I made my purchase through Amazon."
2,First grade writing and reading,"Let me start off by saying i love voyager, the series and while the homecoming books were okay, i still enjoyed them. These two books were so simply written it almost made me feel dumber while reading them. Yes, I found some pleasure in reading them because I`m hooked on Voyager and wanted to see what everyone was up to but the storyline was stupid. The whole part with Chakotay and his native american powers? The cat coming out into the real world? Where was Christie Golden going with this? It was just ridiculous.So, I guess I can say that if you want to keep up on Voyager and you`re a fan, read the books. You`ll finish them both in about an hour. But don`t be looking for great writing and a profound storyline, like the Deep Space Nine books. And Christie, if you`re reading this review, step it up a little in your writing. More original ideas and write for adults, not third graders. We`re capable of a little more."
4,Good fun summer reading,"NOBODY LIKES WORDY REVIEWS; I will be concise.This will never win an award for being a mastery of literature.However, for those that are Trek/Voyager fans, this series is a fun continuation of the story.Those fans* of Voyager fiction will enjoy this fun, fluff, read.It serves its purpose quite nicely in fan fiction, though was not nearly as great as her Dark Matters series; nor as good as Voyager's second book.Buy it, enjoy it, and give it to a fellow trek friend.*This would imply that you are not prone to acting like you are better than everyone else, are a literary know-it-all or are afflicted with rectal-broomstick syndrome."
3,NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION,"Problem is, NO WHERE can I find how many of the Bungees I get in an order. All talks about item price but not about how many you get when you order. Not going to sell many that way. Probably a good product, the ones I use are similar and are quite satisfactory."
4,Excellent parenting advice...,"Elva Anson has written an outstanding book here. As a family therapist for over 15 years, Anson has distilled many of the ""trade secrets"" that therapists teach their clients. If you're a parent, you can pay someone like me $125+ per hour to teach you these skills...or you can read Anson's book.Ms. Anson focuses on important points like* How we keep kids dependent* Support must precede a challenge (VERY important)* Encouragement is the key to growthand most important of all....that home is the classroom for learning life skills.As a professional counselor, I highly recommend this book."
3,Very thick,"This was a very thick paint. Not gloppy, as if it had started to dry out. It was thick enough that it didn't pour out of the bottle, I had to shake it out and it blopped out into a blob that kept it's shape and didn't spread on the palette."
3,BUYER BEWARE,"The grill is fine, but its hard to set up the grill and put it together when the instructions offer very few pictures. And all of the text is written in GERMAN! Yeah, no joke ""Swinger Gril Bruksanvisning"" whatever that means. I hope yours are in english but know that there is a good chance you will have to google up som instructions."
2,I Got Broiled,"I had one of these grills for 14 years and the bottom finally rusted through causing the need for replacement. Because of the features: adjustable grilling surface, vents and side tables I purchased the same model again.I knew the assembly difficulties but was willing to accept them. When I started assembly I could tell immediately that all the steel parts are a lot thinner than the original one. The lid does not have as tight a fit to the bottom half as the original and overall quality is a lot less. Also, while I understand inflation the original only cost me about $35 while the replacement including shipping was more the twice the cost. Next time around I will definitely look at other brands with the same features."
2,goldenbear,"i buy one of these grills every 4-5 years. i really like the style and convenience of it. however this year meco has cut the quality. it rattles and the nuts and bolts fall off often having to be replaced. if you tighten them too much, they inhibit the operation of the lid...shame on you meco...i'd rather pay a little more for the older quality...good thing i still kept my old grill, which i use more than the new one"
5,Meco Charcoal Grill,Great grill. Adjustable grate level makes for even cooking. Works great as a smoker too!
3,The Vector File,"Not as dull as some would have you believe. A few critics are overzealous in their underrating of what is a perfectly acceptable action/drama. When a geological surveyor is sent secret highly sensitive medical document from a brief acquaitance while at a seminar in Russia, it is accidentally intercepted by his daughter printing a horse picture. Unfortunately for his friends, family, and even a female from the Russian Undercover Police, the Russian mafia will kill anyone that may interfere with their pursuit of this biological weapon. At least here we can believe there is a weapon of mass destruction and not some fairytale to invade a country so we can control it's oil. If you enjoyed this movie, take a look atEchelon Conspiracy. Dos vidanya!CA Luster"
3,Computer mistake involves family in international intrigue,"A Russian computer man mistakenly sends a secret DNA code to a New Zealand geologist. Russian agents track down the geologist, not realizing that his little girl intercepted the secret code while playing on his computer."
2,Trying to be fair,"I'm into action and adventure, the more going on the better. I found this a tad dull, I enjoyed the cast of characters, and even the story plot. But it was slow for my taste. However, it works for a rainy afternoon's entertainment. A bit of violence and language is about as risque as it gets."
1,Holy crep !!!,"I'm watching this right now on cable and it is an unbelievable piece of holy cow! The long review below is right on, so many plot holes! I found myself making MST3K comments throughout the whole thing."
5,yummy!,"I bought something like this at an unnamed national coffee chain (you can guess which Washington-based company I'm referring to) and thought they were delish. So I googled the product and lo and behold! They were on Amazon!I had not had Sahale's product but they were GREAT! Vanilla-y, sweet, a little fruit-y due to the pomegranate and just a tiny bit of salt adds that that great sweet-salt combination! I'm anticipating eating these for a long time, they're tasty!"
1,Overloaded with sesame seeds and too chewy!,"The overload of sesame seeds ruined the taste for me. The nuts were chewy instead of crispy and it was mostly nuts, not many cranberries. Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and ""chewy"" nuts ruined it for me. They may have been stale but the lack of a expiration date made that unclear so I trust Amazon wouldn't send me expired goods although they have before."
2,Sahale Valdosta Blend,"If you like it hot, this is te snack for you. It has great content but it was too peppery for me."
1,Disgusting taste,"I got this product as part of a six-flavor package. It turned out to be the only Sahale product that I have tried that is bad. Worse than bad. Terrible. Disgusting. How did this stuff get past the corpoate taste tests? It is even worse than Emerald brand dry roasted almonds, which are awful because of the garlic and onion added. I love plain salted roasted almonds, and thought Sahale could find a way to make them even better tasting. Not this time."
2,Strange texture and taste,"I bought these several days ago from our local supermarket and was very disappointed. The nuts were chewy and slightly soft..is this normal and yes they were months from expiration. Yuck at the softness, however. Then there was a strange texture of hard, little bumps on this softened nut..another yuck. The taste of the flavors blended wasn't my thing either..all wrong in my opinion. I gave it a two because it was edible but will never repurchase."
1,this is one nasty product,I ordered some of these and some pbj sahale snacks. The PBJ is great! This product though it honestly tastes like vomit or something of similar taste enjoy if you like that taste!
4,Not bad,"I bought 3 different flavors as I'm gluten free and they seemed safe. The PB & J was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good. The Almons w/Cranberries is pretty good too! The Barbecue I didn't like AT ALL, they taste strictly like Chipotle, you cannot taste any Ranch, or Barbecue taste."
1,AWFUL!,"Sorry, but I really thought these were awful. My husband didn't like them either and he's really into natural foods. It wasn't the spice & sweet mixture that we didn't like - it just didn't taste good at all. One bag we got was very stale but the others seemed fine. I ended up selling them on ebay!"
2,A Terrible Thing to Do to an Innocent Cashew,"I tried these after enjoying the Valdosta and Ksar blends (which, I realize, are not glazed) - but to me, the combination of vanilla and cashews renders them both bland. Also, the pomegranate is a little thin on the ground."
4,Have to have them,"I have been buying these from Costco for years, but was told a few weeks ago that they were gone and not coming back in the foreseeable future. I hate it when Costco does that! Thank goodness for Amazon -- at least I can order from them! I don't think the ones I received are as fresh as the ones I used to get from Costco. The cranberries are pretty tough to chew. But they're still a tasty snack and indispensable on a salad of spring greens, blue cheese, apples or grapes, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil."
3,Not so Fresh,"I first purchased these Sahale snacks at Costco, and quickly became addicted to them. When I couldn't find them any longer at Costco, I searched the internet for these tasty snacks. I was delighted to find them available at Amazon.com. When they arrived, I opened a pack, and was surprised at how hard the dried cranberries were. The flavor was still good...the nuts still tasted fresh, but the cranberries took some effort to chew. I hope this was just a bad batch, purhaps others are better."
4,Excellent snacks,"Not boring, interesting taste and combination of healthful food items. I take one to gym for after I work out. They are definitly not bland which is why I like them, some have a bit of kick, love the lemongrass in them."
3,gives me heartburn,"I love nuts and almonds among my favorites. When I saw the description of Sahale almonds I was so excited to try it. All the ingredients looked just delicious so I've got a subscription on it. Unfortunately now, when I got my first batch of them and tried, I have to cancel it. Every time I eat them I have a heartburn. Not sure what exactly causes it because I'm fine with pure almonds, sea salt (at least with the one I have at home), honey, cranberries, no known food allergies. It might be salt/nuts/cranberries combination that causes it, not sure."
5,Great Snack,"The snacks arrived on time, well packaged and still taste as good as always. I used to purchase these from Whole Foods but for some reason they stopped stocking them. I actually was checking the internet to see if the company had stopped producing them when I discovered that Amazon sells them! This is my best flavor of all fo the Sahale Snacks."
3,"nice crunch, but a little sweet","I like the texture of the cashews, and the overall flavor is good, but a little too sweet for my taste. I'd like more of the tartness that usually comes with pomegranate."
4,Nom nom nom.,"I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work. After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon. My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad. If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.I give these a 4 because sometimes the almonds are a little over roasted for my tastes but all the girls at work seem to like this one the most so they must know something I don't."
5,Never tasted anytihng like that before...,"Many of the Sahale snacks are just... ok. But a few of them are like opening a bag of crack. This flavor is one of them. They're rich, sweet, salty, and, best of all, give you a fist-full of pure vanilla at the end. Just ate the whole bag.Btw, the other incredible flavor is the Valdosta Pecans."
4,Great Healthy Snack,"I picked Sahale cashews with pomegranate at a Starbuck's after coming from the gym. They are so tasty, not too sweet but sweet enough. I was delighted to be able to order them on Amazon. They are a bit pricey, but come out cheaper when you buy them in bulk vs. buying single packets in local stores. I will buy them again."
3,Relaxing.,"This is music you can play to relax after a long and stressful day and it will definitely help put your mind and soul at ease. The songs by Chuck Loeb, Kim Waters, The Fantasy Band, Marc Antoine and Angela Bofill are this CD's high points."
3,"Excellent device, poor customer service","I've been very pleased with this device. I have mine setup in a site-to-site VPN configuration between a remote office and a primary local site. Instructions are simple. Configuration is amazingly easy.Mine came directly from Sonicwall with a screw loose inside the case. Should be a simple fix. They send me a replacement overnight to replace their damaged product. It wasn't simple. I went round and round with them just to send me the product I paid for. It was like pulling teeth. Even Cisco isn't this hard to deal with. I finally have my replacement but getting them to fix their manufacturing error wasn't what it should have been.5 stars for the product. 1 star for the support under warranty. 3 stars overall. If you get one in good condition, you won't be disappointed. Excellent built-in security. Consider extending the warranty to have access to upgraded software."
5,Pinback is good for the soul,"A few notes of Pinback were enough for me to fall in love with it. It's mellow, and oh so melodic, harmonious and soothing... and I still listen to it regularly (which is always a good sign). Their new effort ""Blue Screen Life"" is currently playing on my hi-fi, and I love it just as much. Pinback have got an amazing ear for harmony, a great feeling for rythm and a generally pleasing attitude towards music. Safe buy !"
5,My God...It just gets better and better,"I can't get over how this cd continues to expand to even greater depths with each listen. I'm not sure what that means. All I know is as I listen to this disc at this moment, I am blown away at how amazing it is."
3,Bubbly Beginnings,"Ushering in this special little bands quirky approach and unique angle is the most accessible of their albums. Unfortunately many of the upbeat, catchily obsessed songs fall flat to their sharp, more progressively inclined rarities on this one, fleshed out well on further releases. Enjoyable, intelligent pop that would be a taste of their continued dedication to the fetch of the catch, the sob of the bob."
2,Do you like lite jazz?,"Like the can of lite beer that has stayed untouched in the back of my fridge for the past two years, so this cd will remain in the back of my collection for years to come. I am not a big lite jazz fan and feel that this is the genre that this cd comes closest to hitting. I purchased it solely based on my impression of Bossa Brava 3 which really made even this lower lip biting white boy want to get up and dance. If you like lite jazz - try it. If you like latin jazz - try #3."
2,Alot of information in a little amount of pages.,"I read this book for my History of Asia class. As far as I know no one was impressed with it and had many problems with it.First, Foltz starts out speaking of religons that hardly anyone in the class had heard of as if we are supposed to know all about them. He does explain them later, but in the first chapters he refrences them without giving any backround information. Most of us were relativly inteligant and felt as if Fotlz were making fools of us. I also felt as if he were stating assumtions rather than facts. It was alot of information in a small amount of time and therefor had to follow."
3,Transgression at its Best (and Worst),"This video's main feature is the 30-minute long video: The Right Side of My Brain starring 80's punk/performance artist Lydia Lunch. While ambitious in its attempt at ""alternative"" cinema, the video's novice production values (in black and white) and droning narration by Lydia Lunch come off more as an eager art school project than a masterpiece of underground movie-making. For hardcore fans of Lydia Lunch and Richard Kern, though, this new issue of short films will be a welcome addition (if you don't already own the original Film Threat Videdo releases)."
4,Canadian Redneck builds a ridiculous bear fighting suit,"Northern Canada must be a very, very boring place! So this freak decides to build a suit capable of withstanding a grizzly bear attack. The suit looks like RoboCop and the ""Danger Will Robinson"" robot's love child. Classic scenes that you'll watch again and again include him getting knocked out by a log and rammed by a pick up truck, all while wearing the Mark VI Grizzly armor. It is totally bizarre and very amusing, especially when the host fills you with stirring insights like, ""anyone worth half a sh** carries a bowie knife into the bush and knows how to use it."" You'll find yourself asking if this guy's for real, and you'll have to decide that for yourself. This is definitely worth watching, if only once, for the sheer spectacle of this absurd character and his hunt for the elusive grizzly."
5,So Funny That It's Kind Of Scary!!!!!,"It's hard to believe that this is a ""real"" person's life that you're watching. Much is left out and that which isn't is manipulated heavily by the director. Troy Hurtubese is so over the top it's hard at first to come to grips with the fact that he's not an actor. It's more than a little disturbing and can be a blast if you watch it with a bunch of friends who are all drunk!"
1,AWFUL,Grizzley man makes this guy look like the biggest self promoting idiot ever! This movie is terrible
5,Very good book. There may be more modern viewpoints on some of its subjects.,"What I first got out of this, because I was looking for it, was that the most knowledgeable people, share the common misconceptions about Schrodinger's interpretations of quantum mechanics.Reading farther, I find it very interesting in terms of history, personalities and old physics that I had not taken the trouble to learn before. He combines his own memories and saved letters with careful survey of other sources."
2,Complete Encyclopedia of the Freshwater Aquarium,I found this book disappointing. Photographs of some of the more common species that are available at local stores were not shown. If there was a photograph of a species somewhere in the book the description segment did not give a reference page for the photograph. Knowing what rare fish look like is nice but not helpful for most novice collectors. In most pet stores these exotic fish are not available.
4,marginally improved,"while this is an excellent record,this particular japanese rvg is somewhat tinny and the low end is not so dynamic.but there's no telling if a reissue will be done on vinyl....."
5,Good Music,"Great band. Great Arrangements.This album is an excellent addition to any CD collection - jazz fan or not.If you can fit it in you budget, buy it. If your a musician check it out.Even if it isn't your typical cup of tea, this is timeless music."
3,Not Real Blueberries...,"For the price, it works. I'm sure kids would love these muffins, but I was a little disappointed that the ""blueberries"" are made in a factory. Go for the slightly pricier muffin mix with the can of real blueberries."
5,Yummy!,"Love these muffins. I like that they are made with just water, so they make a very easy addition to dinner...or a nice, warm treat for breakfast. You don't have to worry whether you've got milk on hand or not. They mix up quickly with no big lumps, they bake evenly and taste amazing."
4,Very Good,These blueberry flavored muffins are very good and very easy to prepare. A good size package for one or two people.
2,Poor understanding of historical facts,"By the way, Serbs did not really annex Kosovo in 19th century. If so how would the author explain the existence of so many historical buildings that date from before the invasion of Turks during Ottoman Empire and were being built over centuries? Has the author looked carefully into the history of Southern Slavs from 7th century to the time before 1918? Further, there is a major difference between Chetnks and Ustashas in terms of their motives for the atrocities both did. The former were brutal political opponents, killing in the name of King no matter the nationality. The latter were brutal nationalists, killing those of other ethnic origin or religion.And so on, many details are distorted to fit the author's prejudice. It is important to look at all the facts before writing a fact book."
4,Tasty,"Well, after shipping I'm not sure it's terribly honest to call them Whole Cashews... I'm sure they were that way at one time. Still, about 80% whole cashews, ever so slightly over salted for my taste, but good none the less. Worth it for the about $1 per canister I paid."
4,Nuts,Ordered the EN Whole Cashews and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the taste. They are much better than the nuts I get from a local store and come in small 4.5 ounce canisters which are perfect for my 3 year old doughter to snak on and hold in her hand.
3,Wizard of Oz 70th Aniversary with Posters,"This item came without the posters. After calling Amazon about this, I was told that the posters were no longer available. They gave me the option to return the item for a refund."
2,Disc 2,"The movie Wizard of Oz was wonderfuls. I've always wanted it in my collection. This disappointment came when I played Disc 2 ""The Life and Times of Author Frank Baum."" It Was Out Of Focus and therefore I could not watch it. This is the first time I have gotten a dud from Amazon."
4,There's no place like home,"The special edition 2nd DVD is quite interesting and informative about what went into the ""behind the scenes"" Wizard of Oz...and of course, the movie just takes me back to being a kid and looking forward to the annual TV premiere!"
5,timeless treasure,"i almost got my daughter the 5 disc set, but i couldn't imagine what ELSE would be on the 5 disc set that wasn't on this set. My daughter loves this and has been watching it constantly getting ready to audition for Dorthy in the local community playhouse - she's got Judy's voice down to a T in the songs! Everyone in the world i think has seen this movie!"
4,Beautiful blu-ray restoration,"As has been said by many others, the blu-ray restoration is beautiful. Even if you've seen the film before in theatres and on dvd... you will see clarity and details that you've never seen before.I will repeat what has been said by others as well... the copy of ""Dreamer of Oz"" included here is almost ""un-watchable."" It looks like a second generation vhs copy made off of broadcast tv... it's unfortunate because the content is quite good.The new profile on Victor Fleming and the featurette on the munchkins are also quite good."
4,lovely memories,"purchased this because it had so been long since viewing. it is better than i remembered. the color is amazing, the quality of the product is great. i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone of any age."
5,RE-VISITING OZ IS WONDERFUL!,"Has anyone ""not"" seen this film? I hadn't seen this film in many years,but I had seen it at least 25 times. I watched the new 3 disc special edition on my home theater and it was amazing! The picture and sound are beautiful and clear. It must look better than when this film was released in theaters back in 39'. The extras on this set are incredible too. If you are a fan of the movie and want to know if this set is worth it....it is!"
4,Good old standard,This movie must have been quite a shock in 1939 when it switched from the black and white of Kansas to the technicolor fantasy of Oz.
2,dvd scratched,"The blue ray disc was scratched...which we cleaned and it still skipped once. We returned it and we are waiting. It said disc one which was confusing.....The price was good, but it was disconcerting to return it so soon.....just bought a blue ray machine."
5,~*~*~*~*~*GREAT!!~*~*~*~*~*,I was thrilled with the quality of the picture at such a great price! This is an all time favorite and even as an adult I could watch this movie over and over again!! :)
3,Back to the well again...,"Jeesh... How many times are they going to go back to the well? I thought the 2005 was the ultimate edition. So in 2009, it's the 70th year anniversary. Well, don't buy this one, there'll probably be a 75th and of course a 100th (and maybe an 80th, 85th, 90th, 95th as well).I think I have 3 or 4 different sets on DVD now. I'm done with 'em. I don't think I watched the LAST two versions I bought.If you don't own it, I suppose it's a great set. But how will you feel when they release another Ultimate set in 5 years? That's how I feel right now.If you don't own it, I give it 5 stars. If you own the 3 disc set from 2005, I give it 1. Average is 3."
3,"Great Package, But...",Of course the Wizard of Oz is a great film and this is a great package. But be aware that the digital copy that is included has an expiration date of 9/30/10 so that it is no longer viewable. This was a big disappointment to me since I was looking forward to transferring it onto my iPad.
4,Fear Not Korean Subtitles,"I could not find ""The Wizard of Oz"" anywhere in town, and it wasn't available on many other websites, either, not until September. So I was excited to find it on Amazon. The DVD arrived in perfect condition - and very quickly - but when I saw foreign writing all over the case I opened it right away. You see, it was to be a gift for my 4-year old grandson who is (to date, anyway) only proficient in English, and I needed to be sure that the film's dialogue was in English, too. All was well, as the foreign language turned out to be Korean, which was only an option for the closed-captioned feature. After I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled a bit, I mailed it to him and he absolutely loves it. He had never seen it before, and my daughter tells me that the first time he watched it, he was glued to the screen when the witch melted. It is now an ""old"" favorite of his. Thanks for having it!"
2,I was expecting more from Blu Ray,"I have been an avid fan of The Wizard of Oz since I was a child. I bought every format the movie came in that I had equipment to play it on. I purchased every anniversary edition. I find the blu ray disappointing. The ""black and white"" is more reddish brown. The audio is horrible. In the beginning when Dorothy runs down the dirt road to talk to Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, you can hear the chickens clucking better than the voices. I was expecting more from the Blu Ray release and wish I would have saved my money."
2,Not really impressed,"The remastered movie was great but the ""extra"" video stuff was either boring or not of interest to me. There was a whole two-sided CD of the history of MGM - sort of an ad really. The other CD, besides the actual movie, was all about Baum and his life, background, early productions, etc. I would have liked to see info on the stars and the shooting of the movie, maybe outtakes or ""never before seen""s. The written stuff was okay along with the other fluff. The watch was kinda cute."
5,Excellant,"Great shippig arrived in prefect time, this company atleast knows how to send something unlike other company's"
3,"cute, but a very thirties mentality pervades","perhaps i've become jaded over the years. i used to love this one as a kid but now all i see are images of the 1930's. the technicolor munchkinville is vulgar, especially the blue-dyed water. the witch is the most entertaining of the lot and garland is beautiful as always."
2,Restoration Over-Hyped,"Got my copy yesterday and quickly ran through each chapter on the blu-ray disc and then did the same with my copy of the 2005 ""definitive"" restoration. Running on a brand new Sony ps3 connected via HDMI to a Sony KDL-46W5100. Yes, there is a difference, but is it a $50.00 difference? I don't think so. After all, the movie is 70 years old. If you want the tchotchkes spend the $$, otherwise, if you have the 2005 version-you're OK. For everyone who would hype the glory of blu-ray they would do well to remember the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. I think there is a good reason that blu-ray is not as ubiquitous as DVD.Just noticed: Amazon has clumped all reviews ever of this movie here, pay attention to whether it is blu-ray or not!"
1,"Amazon streaming is a joke! I paid to watch this, their streaming server was down but I was still charged. Don't use this!! N","Amazon streaming is a joke! I paid to watch this, their streaming server was down but I was still charged. Don't use this!!"
3,Not wide screen? Am I doing something wrong?,Why is this not wide screen? I didn't even think you could have 4/3 on blue ray. I'm hoping this is user error.
1,Nothing special!,"This Blu-ray is not very impressive! Actually, the televised version looks better. Please, Please, if your going to put out a movie on Blu-ray, at least clean it up."
3,A Classic made better,"This is a nice DVD to have for the whole family. It is not a HD version of ""Oz."" It is just a bluray version of an old format."
1,Dnt waist yo tyme,I bought this movie in it dnt even work I tried to play it in a few DVD Player but still didnt work it said that the movie is Damage I even cleaned the disc that didnt work
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD","I don't know who to blame, Warner Brothers for making a dud DVD, or Amazon for selling me what was obviously a returned DVD. There was a hand-written serial number at the top of the cardboard cover, and the plastic wrap covering it was very shoddy.The DVD itself was dirty, but I cleaned it and played it to see if that was the extent of the damage. It wasn't. The sound goes in and out--with long periods of silence--during the 1979 interviews with surviving cast members Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, and Jack Haley. The rest of the behind-the-scenes extras seems to have been spared. I haven't watched the movie itself yet, so I'm hopeful that at least the movie is intact. If not, I'll return the DVD and wait for the October release of the Oz DVD package.The film is a classic, beloved by million and millions. Not even a dud DVD can tarnish this gem of a movie."
1,This DVD is missing parts of the movie.,I've seen this movie every year since I was three. I finally bought the DVD and was very disappointed to find the whole part after the Wicked Witch melts isn't on this version!! No Ding Dong the Witch is Dead!
1,DVD Wizard of Oz,DVD is American and can only be viewed on computer! Very disappointing! Was hoping to show it to a class and found I couldn't. If it's being sold in the UK it should be viewable on our systems!
4,Wizard of Oz,The graphics are much better than when I watched it on TV as a kid. As much fun today as it was then.
2,This could have been better!,"Not crazy over the Blu-ray version. It is not much better then the DVD Wizard of Oz, plus there is no real menu screen or good pop-up screen to pick chapters of the movie.The menu is nothing but a list and the movie starts right up as you put it in with no menu. This disc is setup very basic no extra nothing really, This Blu-ray should have been $5.00 because they give you nothing extra from the DVD but a very little cleaning of this movie. Sorry, I got it.Don't throw your money away just wait for a better version on Blu-ray. Blu-ray is still new and they will redo the movies a 100 times before the format dies and we move too something new. I think they did Wizard of Oz 4 times in the USA on DVD, So Blu-ray it will be done 8 more times before the format is die. lol"
4,Almost perfect,"I agree with most of the reviews on here about this being a great Blu-Ray release. There is only one thing that annoys me, it's the fact that this is presented in 4:3 instead of 16:9. Every TV being sold today is HD and widescreen. Why would anyone put out a 4:3 Blu-Ray is beyond me since Blu-Ray is an HD format and all recent HDTV's are 16:9. No one still watching a standard definition TV will get any benefit from Blu-Ray! This release would receive 5 stars if the movie were presented in wide screen."
1,A horrible film translation of a classic story,"I find this movie to be an abominable mess. Having grown up reading the Oz books I have been waiting for an acceptable film version of my favorite book series. Wizard of Oz is garbage in my opinion. The worst part is how the film makes you think Dorothy dreamt of her trip to Oz!!! If you have read the books you know this isn't true. Also her shoes are supposed to be silver, not ruby. Read the books and trust me, the movie will seem like trash. Or buy Return to Oz, which is a MUCH better book to film translation than the VERY unforgettable Wizard of Oz. L. Frank Baum would not allow this sloppy translation of a movie to be released if he were alive. It's a good thing he can't see what Hollywood did to his beloved Oz. TERRIBLE!!"
1,Knock-off!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"First off the plastic wrapping on the movie said that it was from Mexico!!!! Next, I load it into my blu-ray player and it has issues reading it for a few minutes then it just starts the movie, no menue, nothing! Then the picture is nothing special and it is not widescreen! The black space is on the sides, not above and below. So upset! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I assumed that since it was fulfilled by amazon it would be reliable."
4,Dreamer of Oz Shame on you Warners,I got the Dreamer of Oz in a 2 disc W.O.Z set & had to see what the fuss bad reviews was all about. Well the picture is clearly out of focus for a 1990 movie the 1910 short had a 100% better picture than this tv movie. They had the chance to find a better print now if they could just focus this one. Everyone who wanted a set just for this should be given a new transfer.
5,THE WIZZARD OF OZ,"Warner Bros. has created a moving picture about that unforgetable land called Oz, and released it once again on video, this time remastered and featuring a behind-the-scenes special as well as the ORGINAL WIZZARD OF OZ movie trailer.I saw this film in the theaters last year. I have not seen the video verson, but I hope it's as great as it was on the big screen!"
2,Very grainy blu-ray picture,"Maybe I got a lemon, but this is easily the grainiest and poorest quality blu-ray picture I have ever seen. At first I thought it might be my player, which was getting pretty dated. So I upgraded to a brand new player, and viewed the movie again. And it looks exactly the same. My old VHS version of the 1939 classic looked a lot better than this blu-ray version. Very disappointing."
2,Bittersweet,"Wow...compared to my VHS copy this was an awesome picture. However, I was highly disappointed that there is no MENU on the first disc. The disc starts with a copyright warning & goes right into the movie. After the movie there are about 40 more copyright warnings in different languages & finally a digital menu appears. At no time could I access the menu using the remote. I am highly disappointed as I thought I was getting a good deal at $33.99 compared to the higher priced Emerald editions on Amazon. It makes me wonder if this particular item is an authentic Warner Brothers release. Of course, it is entirely possible that I got the only defective copy but I thought I would post my comment anyway."
5,LOVE the extras,I already have the fiftyth anniversary edition so it was only right to get the next milestone of a movie I really love .
5,Obviously a classic!,"My 7 year old loves the movie. The accompanying anniverdary disc is not particularly of interest to her, but she may find it more interesting when she's older."
5,The Greatest Children's Film Ever,"This is the greatest children's film ever. But of course it pertains to adults. ""A lot of people without a brain say a lot."" Problem: the scarecrow's statement about the isosceles triangle is wrong. And the wizard's statement that it doesn't matter how much you love, but how much others love you, is just the opposite of reality. People can hate you for any reason at all or no reason at all. But how do you respond to them?Anyway, it's still great. The good ol' days. No swearing, no suggestive language, nothing sexual at all. Now poppies? Well, that one's up for debate. Meanwhile, I still love this film."
5,To the viewer from San Jose,"If you READ the back of the DVD, you would LEARN that the movie was FILMED in full-screen. Widescreen hasn't been used forever, you know. If it was made WS, THAT would be a change from the original release."
4,alltime family special,Good children memories brought to lifeThis movie wii never grow old. Thanks Dorothy and the Wizard.Love this movie forever
5,"""If I only had a brain""","What needs be said of this marvelous masterpiece? ""I'll get you, my pretty! And your little dog too!"" Munchkins, winged monkeys, witches and a wizard whom happens to turn out to be a side show cryer."
5,A classic,"Wizard of oz is a classic of it's own. My mother seen it at the movies when it first came out. She watch it every timeIt came on, so I grew up watching it and love it. . Now I have my grandchildren watching it ,they love it.This movie never get old and at any age you will enjoy it. It's a great DVD and the colors are so vivid"
4,Great box-set with one minor flaw that keeps me from me for giving it 5 stars,"This is a must have purchase for any ""The Wizard of Oz"" fan. But, I can only give it five stars. The only weakness is the quality of the print material for the film ""The Dreamer of Oz"" is terrible. The film was great but the print material reminds me of a badly streamed video single. Still even with the quality of ""The Dreamer of Oz"" this box-set is outstanding in any other way."
1,Serious Crime to the Masterpiece,"I don't own this DVD, but watched the movie on a black-and-white TV screen. And I was already disappointed to watch the movie in the defective 4:3 format. To put their dirty hand and cut short of this wonderful masterpiece, how dare they, when they are given such a media like DVD! I should just wait for the widescreen version which I don't know when to come out.I meant five stars for the movie, and no star for the DVD."
1,Hate it.,There's something about people breaking out into song and dance for every insogniffogant thing that really bugs me.
1,worst movie ever,this film has been known to be a the best clasic movie of all time but in my oppinion its the complete opposit i think it was a horibal film my resons are its completly off the book and also a good part of the acting was bad but i would say garlands acting in this movie was the worst of her career so its hard to understand why people like this in reading some of the othere reviews on this movie i saw one by a peson called LMBbaurfan fan one of my freinds and if you wish to leave comments on my review please do so
1,The Wizard of Oz,"I wish I could review this product, but as of 12/8/08, I still have not received this item. It was suppose to be here before Thanksgiving at the very latest and here it is the 8th of Dec. and it still has not come. I am very disappointed because I was going to use this DVD in my classroom.If and when I ever get this DVD, I will let you know.L. Annis"
1,No Floyd? No Buy,The only reason to ever watch the Wizard of Oz is if you are playing Dark Side of the Moon at the same time. (after the third lion roar start up dark side.)
1,view online/ and new remastered version,The Wizard of oz has always been a favorite movie of mine. I feel that the most remastered version has been remastered so much it has lost some of its charm. For instance the black and white is now sepia.The reason for the 1 star is not regarding the movie but the view online option. I purchased the movie as a gift along with an opportunity to view it online. This did not work. Throughout the viewing it played the soundtrack twice. One time was about 0 seconds before the soundtrack that went with the picture. Also the video tended to skip and repeat 5 seconds of the video2-3 times.If I were to purchase this movie I would purchase an older addition and skip the remastered version.
3,not widescreen,The movie was originally filmed in widescreen so I assumed this blu-ray disc was also in widescreen but it's not. A major disappointment.
1,Totally NOT worth it!!!!,"Don't waste your money on this or any other supposed Blu-Ray version of this movie. It is not widescreen and the quality is no different than the regular DVD version. They did nothing to enhance the image nor the sound. You cannot change the aspect ratio and the extras are only worth it if you are really, really into that sort of thing. Even then I would still hesitate to pay this much for such things. The other goodies in the box were of no use to me. (I would have returned this item but it was given to me as a gift and the giver would have known I returned it.)"
3,Warner Brothers' Poor Blu-Ray Quality,"The video itself is a wonderful transfer, but Warner Brothers' continuing problems with Blu-Ray disks that go flaky with little if any warning makes buying this a questionable proposition. I've had a number of Warner Brothers Blu-Rays just stop working without a scratch, smudge or dimple. I've tried contacting WB about this, but they don't respond. The regular DVDs seem to work well, but the Blu-Rays seem to have some production problems. (And just try to get one replaced after several months, which is how long it takes for these disks to fail.)If anyone knows if WB is ever going to address these problems (Wiz. of Oz, Willie Wonka and others), I'd like to know. I've tried these disks on multiple devices and they've failed to play -- and this after playing flawlessly six or seven times. It's as if suddenly, boom -- they stop being recognized.I've had no problems with the DVDs, though."
5,Christmas gift,I got this as much for my enjoyment as I did for my kids. They were quite happy to get it.
4,Memories,I can recall this movie more than 50 years ago and I'm glad I have it on my collection for my Siblings to view and have. Great Movie A Classic.
5,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS MOVIE!,THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN IT. GREAT BUY! VERY HAPPY!
5,The Wizard of Oz,"What can I say?? It's the Wizard of Oz!! All of the extras that came with it really are neat to have! My daughter really has enjoyed them and we're looking forward to looking at all of the cool things on the 3 discs. (just haven't had time to watch everything yet). I'm not worried though...you can't go wrong with this awesome, time tested movie!"
2,The Wizard Needs To Rework This Video,"Whether it's Amazon's streaming service or the digital copy of the film itself, this beloved film was difficult to watch due to stopped action at what seemed to be every scene or camera angle change. The 'freeze' only lasts an instant, but was very distracting as it happened through out the streamed content. There was also flashing that was horrible during the b&w oncoming tornado crossing the field scene. I watch streaming vids all the time from Netflix and other sources and have never scene anything like this before from any other on-line source. It's too bad there were so many technical flaws in the streaming film content because the Technicolor restoration of the film is quite dazzling otherwise."
5,Enjoyed with 5 yr old,"Enjoyed it watching with my 5 yr old, who was preparing for Mrs Gulch at the school show. She could relate to the story as she knew the story already. Video Quality was good."
4,LOVE THE EXTRAS!,"Who didn't grow up on this one? But, the extras are a steal. Loved it beginning to end. And the commentaries. Especially the home movies! When they were shooting the Jitterbug number that was cut! PERFECTION!"
1,Not happy,No where on the listing did it state this was only in black and white. I was dissapointed that it wasn't in color
3,wizard of oz,"i had never seen the movie before, and it was recommended i see it before attending the ""Wicked"" performance in order to understand the performance better. it did provide me with some insight as to some of the character backgrounds and inside jokes of the performance, as it was true to the movie. as far as the dvd itself, i guess it was as good as could be expected from a colorized edition of the original movie..."
3,good but not great....,"The film is terific , all ages can enjoy this classic. as i have bought the vhs, Ultimate oz Laserdisc set, The dvd set and now this blu-ray version , you could say i like this film.However, i find the bluray edition not as sharp as the dvd edition , in addition getting to extras menu was a real chore.take the sequence when the lion is in oz and gets his crown from the tin man. On the VHS , LD and dvd edition you can see the fishing wire wiggeling the lions tail - but this is not evident on the bluray. have they corrected it ?they should not be tampering with a classic.i saw this bluray through a HD projector, with image comming from the Oppo bluray player.sound also seams very effects heaving rather than focusing on dialog between the actors.Film *****sound ***image ****next up this weekend is gone with the wind - i hope they havent tampered with that as well !"
5,One of the greatest musical stories avaialbe on DVD!,Pop some corn and take this trip down memory lane. Is there anyone who doesn't know all the words by now?!
5,A Childhood Treasure,This version is a Great Redo for a Treasure of a movie that I have watched yearly my whole life. Now passed down to my grand kids in a Blu-ray format.
5,Wizard of Oz video,"This is one great movie. The new digital version is superb, especially on a HDTV. The second DVD that gives the movie's background just makes the movie all that better. One special track showed the mistakes in the movie. Never saw those before and makes the viewing even richer for such a polished movie."
4,wiz of oz,"the dvd came quickly, but every once in a while it would stop in the middle of playing, so i had to go out and purchase a dvd repair kit for around 20 dollars, and once i did the repair to the dvd, it worked fine."
2,Korean Oz,"Although I noted the word ""import"" in the information included on this order, I was not expecting to find Korean subtitles! I attempted to contact Horizon DVD twice before opening the DVD, but did not hear back from them. We finally decided to open and play the DVD and after a bit of trial and error, were able to delete the subtitles. However a few minutes into the DVD it quit playing! We were able to fast forward past this spot, but have decided to return the DVD as it appears to be defective. I love The Wizard of Oz, but this product is substandard."
5,pleased,"we had the movie at one point, but it was lost. my kids love the movie and watch it all the time."
5,Cautionary 5 Stars!,"I give this DVD version a cautionary 5 star rating only because of the actual film itself, which stands on it's own as a wonderful classic for all ages. However for the extra money you'll shell out for the ""Deluxe"" DVD version be warned this is only for the true OZ collector. The boxed set includes some very nice suitable for framing lithographs, a large, paperback bound script and of course the DVD itself. Finally that's where my caution comes into play, the usual added tidbits on the DVD are nice but the Angela Lansbury 50th Anniversary section is obviously transferred from video and though watchable it is still slightly fuzzy. Last but not least is the film itself which is still wonderful and magical."
5,My girlfriend loved it.,I got this as a gift for my girlfriends birthday and she loved everything about it. She watched the movie while she framed the posters and hung them up and read off interesting facts about the movie from the book that came with it. Very worth it.
2,Poor quality,"The cover say Jody Garland not Judy Garland (haha), It feels and looks like a boot leg dvd. Wish we got the original mgm dvd."
3,Dark Side please,"Add Pink Floyds ""Dark Side of the Moon"" as the actual soundtrack and you wouldn't be able to print them fast enough. I know that kids aren't going to understand this and maybe that's just as well but this movie takes on an almost disturbing quality when viewed with DSOTM. It is an outstanding experience."
5,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. You think you've seen it all before. That's true, but it takes on a new meaning each time you watch it as you evolve!"
3,Sepia too much color,"The movie rates five stars, it's perfect. But I did not like the sepia in the Kansas segments when I saw this new version on TV recently. It has too much color and does not give enough contrast to Oz. Maybe it has to do with how the rods and cones in our eyes work. The black & white Kansas was better!"
4,Looks PLEASE,Good movie but hard to dance to!Scarecrow got a suave new cut; good stylist can you recommend?Tin Man got some good Polish. Bright.Lion pedicure maybe. Sharp.A must read.
3,Not in wide screen 1:33 and it is Blu Ray,The movie is the Wizard of OZ. Great movie. My giving it 3 stars is that it is NOT wide screen. I need to see the whole screen. I changed the TV to go wide screen but it just didn't look right. Just letting you know.
5,Blu-ray is best,"Everything looks better on blu-ray, that includes Oz! It's worth paying a little more for the br version. The sound is excellent and the color is beautiful."
2,Not such a good video,This isn't such a great video. The parts of the wicked witch and the violence and the no-color can make children that are 4 or younger scared and make them want color.
2,Willy Wonka is so much better.,"I used to enjoy this movie every year as a kid, and I recently watched it again after a hiatus of several years. It just did not hold up! While I'll grant that the visuals and special effects were great for a film from the '30s, the movie is too long, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the script is silly. The only engaging performances (other than Garland's singing) were from the Wicked Witch of the West and Toto (and I guess the Wizard, to some extent). A good example of the wonders of Hollywood and mass-marketing."
1,I would rather get 12 shots from the doctor than watch this movie again!,"By LetriceI just watched the Wizard of Oz and I am telling you that it is short for the most terrible movie in the world. It's about a girl that wears shiny shoes, and the wicked witch wants her shoes. Then, one day the witch gets the monkeys to get Dorothy's shoes. The monkeys catch the lion, the girl, the scarecrow, and the tin man. Find out what happens when the monkeys catch them.The part when it was the most terrible was when they got massages, and then they do nothing after that. It was so boring! ""Come on!"" said my mother. Then my dad said that this was the worst movie ever for him. I fell asleep, and my mom said that I should go to bed.I would rather get twelve shots from the doctor than watch the Wizard of Oz again. It is a waste of your time and money. Someone who enjoys bright colors might like the movie. You can find it at your movie or sometimes it's on TV."
3,The Secret Garden:,When I recived the product the DVD product did not have any kind of label. I had to look really good in the center and it had the name of the DVD.
3,Disappointed with the new transfer,"As brilliant as this 3 disc edition is,I must confess that the new digital transfer was disappointing to me. The opening sepia sequences were incredibly grainy for some reason. The Technicolor sequences seemed very dark, and the flesh tones very red--white folk aren't that color in real life!! Someone needed to balance and match up these elements consistently from scene to scene. I found myself constantly adjusting the picture on my tv throughout the film. I then got out the previously released Wizard dvd to compare and found to my chagrin the picture quality is MUCH BETTER!!!P.S.-that rivet in the center of the tin man's head can be seen just as clearly in the earlier Wizard dvd."
4,Review through the eyes of a 5 year old,"My grand-daughter received this movie for Christmas. I asked her last evening if she liked the movie, and she did. Her favorite characters were the ""fairy godmother"" and the Cowardly lion. She liked Dorothy, and really wants a pair of her shoes. She was a little scared by the witch and the flying monkeys, and commented she never knew monkeys could fly.The magic of this movie is still there, with yet another generation to enjoy it. And she loves the music too. Would highly recommend this classic. Looking forward to watching it with her."
2,Product not working....,"I recently bought this dvd The Wizard of Oz 2-disc Edition and sent it for my niece in London but she was so disappointed as Disc 1 is not working. My mom tried it a few times for her, they even tried cleaning it and tried it again but its still not working, and Disc 2 is working very well.I would really love to get a new copy of the dvd to send for her. I was a bit unhappy."
5,Yippee!,"This really cool box set arrived damaged and we negotiated for a return that was very easy and smooth, thanks everyone!"
1,HORRIBLE CONDITION!,"I didn't even get a chance to see how the new picture quality and sound was, I was too mad about the actual condition my set was in. The cover had scratches all over it leaving behind silver markings everywhere. The wrap that it came in had holes in it too. Plus the corners were all bent and looked like it had just been thrown in the package with not a care in the world. I'm returning it now because that's just ridiculous. This was suppose to be a Christmas gift, but there's NO WAY I would give it to somebody in that sort of condition."
3,Only worth upgrade if you haven't get it on DVD!,"Just got my hand on The Wizard of Oz BD single disc edition. I didn't buy the ultimate edition (what a load of junk, especially since I already got the 2005 2 disc DVD Special Edition). Image is only marginally sharper (very marginally!) then DVD. Brightness fair better the Gond With The Wind BD (GWTW BD is a disappointment!) Grain is also more obvious due to HD.I should have expected this, as there is only so much WB could do to the 70 years old source material. No matter 4K or 8K remastered, the image is always going to be soft and grain is going to be obvious.It's still worth an upgrade for me as the 2005 DVD have problem with noise on the right front channel, I have to watch with Mono soundtrack. Stick to your DVD if your DVD don't have such problem.And can forget about the Emerald Edition, which is WAY OVER PRICE!"
4,Wizard of Oz,This is such a classic story for all ages. I bought it for my kids to watch but ended up giving it to my parents as a gift! This timeless story never gets old:)
4,Not all there,"If you are looking for a restored visual of the original movie, you will be missing some things. THey have taken out the song, ""The Witch is Dead"". Not sure why it was taken out."
5,Nice,Bought this for my girlfriend a while back and it stands the test of time. Loaded with features and any fan would appreciateowning this.
5,One of my favorites by far,"I can't even begin to describe the feeling I get when I watch this movie. By the time it ends I'm floating on air. This is such a powerful reminder of youth and fantasy. Everyone knows all the songs, we all know the story. If I could give this movie more stars I would. I hope this film is shown to every generation that comes after me, keep the tradition alive everyone."
5,Rick's Review,"""BEST MOVIE EVER MADE""The Dreamer Of OZ video on here is a movie thatEVERYONE who ever loved the Wizard Of OZ shouldwatch---the DREAMER OF OZ is worth the entire priceof the two DVD set."
5,DVD review,"Great quality DVD, great price of this timeless classic.The color quality is perfect and loved going back to my childhood when viewing."
5,Pleasantly Surprise,The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition (Blue-Ray)is a very nice product. I was impressed and pleasantly surprised. The color are sharp and vivid. I especially liked the digital copy for my iPOD; it looks just as beautiful as the blue-ray edition. I found that today's small children also enjoy this movie and made a purchase for a couple of munchkins that I know.
5,very good,buena pelicula la recomiendo al 100 % la vi en mi infancia y me trae muchos recuerdos por esa razon la compre
5,better than you remember,Flawless in HD with excellent sound. Includes fascinating extras. You have never seen OZ like this.
3,It's okay,"I watched this so that I can better understand the play Wicked. I gave it okay because it is more suitable for young kids, lacking the sophisticatedness for adults."
5,We're Off To See The Wizard!,"If You have never owned this movie before now is the time to buy it. The picture is incredible. Blu-ray brings out the the best in movies and The Wizard of Oz the the perfect venue to show it. The collectors edition features several outstanding documentaries. The highlight of which is MGM:WHEN THE LION ROARS, a six hour history of MGM studios. A beautiful collectors watch is also included as well as booklets and photos. If you own A blu-ray player you should get this set right away"
1,Blu Ray is HORRIBLE,This is without a doubt the absolute worst transfer and a terrible travesty. I have laserdisc (75th anniversary...wonderful) and DVD (anniversary) and both are SUPERIOR at every single level to this absolutely disgusting travesty. Not worth a cent.
3,Great product...condition was VERY disappointing,"For a 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition of one of the greatest movies of all time, I was very satisfied with the movie and the accessories. However, I encourage to purchase this item from another seller, as the item arrived with a torn box. Not just a subtle tear, but the box looked like it was falling apart as it was ripped down the corners. VERY disappointing for this edition of the movie, considering it is brand new and ""one of a kind"""
3,Damaged products invade Amazon,"I was really looking forward to getting my box set in, and I must say the S&H; was very fast!!! The only problem is the seems of the set were ripped from top to bottom. I still use Amazon, this was my first problem, so ehh, I can deal with it.ThanksGeorge"
1,Incomplete order,"I would like to give a good review but I cannot since my order was incomplete. The extras 9 photos/postcards, etc) were not included,, only the DVD. I was very unhappy."
5,Dorothy Sings It Beter than Ever,"The whole production is better than the original. It is like seeing it again but for the first time, Audio is great and clarity of image is fantastic. What a treat! I have several other copies and not one even comes close. Do not miss this."
5,Chock full of Blu-ray Goodness,"Everyone over the age of four has seen The Wizard of Oz, but not like this. Brilliantly restored color and crisp images make it a real treat and a bargain at this price. In addition to the film are oodles of documentaries and other goodies. You will be an expert on this film if you watch all the special features. Highly recommended!"
4,The Wizard Of Oz Blue Ray HD Collectors Set,"Not all of the HD Wizard of Oz Blue Ray 70th were created equally. In Canada there was no 8X10 collector cards included in the set only in USA ...... So I had to buy an American copy HD Blue Ray to get the 8x10 collector photos. The price was very good on this Box Set in HD but I bought it on a pre-sale in both countries. I wanted one to open and one to save in mint condition. One problem with that is on every box including US you get a ""BONUS DIGITAL COPY"" message on the packaging but when I opened mine I have ONLY until Sept 29 2010 to download it. I hate that! I just don't know why they didn't just put one already made in each collectors box set is beyond me. Other than that picture and sound are incredible to watch in HD and LOVE all the extras you get regarding the movie!"
5,STILL ENTERTAINING TODAY,AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THIS IS STILL ONE OF MOST ENTERTAINING MOVIES EVER MADE..CHARMING CAST OF CHARACTERS..ONCE AGAIN PROOF POSITIVE THAT HOLLYWOODS GOLDEN ERA IS GONE FOREVER.....
5,Another Walk Down the Yellow Brick Road,Could it get any better than Blu Ray? The colors are more exciting that I remember as a little kid. Now on my own private 42 screen makes this experience a true treasure. The detail of the costumes and the make-up are incredible and well worth this package. The extra's make this edition a cherished item.
5,Still great for the little ones,"My wife and I bought one for a four year old granddaughter when she told us she heard of the movie, but had never seen it. She loved the story, the production and the characters. One of her favorites. The background story about the production made this more than just another old movie."
5,Re-Enjoy!,"This upgraded production is beautiful in it's scale. It was always a childlike wonderment to watch it change from black & white to color. Now that it has been done for Blu-Ray the details and colors are more noticeable and vivid. If you enjoyed this story before, you will certainly enjoy watching it again in this newer format."
5,Magical,Love the restored quality and all the extras. The story is cute and so are the actors. Good old fashioned Hollywood and we adore it!!!
3,"interesting, but...","It is absolutely fantastic in its own way, but I really just don't understand what the fuss is about. Why is this such an institution, or American icon? Why is it so culturally significant? Am I missing something? Or maybe because I grew up watching original Star Wars instead of this, or my fault may be that I read the book(s) before watching the movie? I just can't help but feeling this movie is way too overrated in every which way."
4,A Classic,"I had no idea The Wizard of Oz was 70 years old. It is surely a classic, and to find it as the Gold Box Deal, it was just too good to pass up. I bought two of them, and a ten year old niece was thrilled with the gift. Great price for a great movie. Thanks for the deal."
1,Doesn't work in Australia,"Beware! This DVD is not compatible with Australian system of DVD players. Not sure why it's available for shipment to Australia when it's pretty much useless here :( Really a shame, the kids were looking forward to it."
1,Oz Bluray quality disappointing,"No need to review the film here. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a timeless classic. I just purchased the three disc bluray set. I must admit I am terribly disappointed in the quality. It looks very grainy. Just a little better quality than the DVD. I've seen other old films put to bluray and they look great. But this one looks aweful. I'm very surprised I haven't read any reviews that pointed this out. Very much surprised that people are happy with the bluray. The DVD is horrid, and the bluray isn't much better. What happened MGM?"
5,The best,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? If I had the Wizard of Oz the movie on a device that I carried with me as a kid, I may never had gotten in trouble at meetings and long boring trips."
5,"Wizard of Oz, 70th Anniversary Collector's Edition","Excellent Edition, many extras included! Would reccomend it to any one that is a fan of the Wizard of Oz!"
5,Wizard of Oz...,I got the movie for my mother as a Christmas present and she loved it. I would recommend this provider and I would not hesitate to use them again.
2,disc error showed,When I open the disc to play it for the class. It showed disc error. Upon looking at the disc I noticed several scratches on it. I was highly dissappointed.
4,Great Collectors Item,"This is a beautiful set for any collector. If you wish to have a nice set and still save some money; I would go with the next step down. With this box set you pay extra for a couple copies of actual playbills, tickets, photos and other paper-like things that come in little sleeves. All the extras on the extra DVD's were nice to watch, but I think with the other series (the next step-down) there were similar DVDs that were included in that set as well. I would have done that to save money, but oh well, Like I always say about money ""Here it comes, and there it goes."" Overall, this is a great addition to any movie library. With a great classic like this movie it is worth getting a nice polished one."
5,"The Wizard of Oz - Original, classic full length.","I was very pleased to find this flim on line. I bought it for my grandchildren to watch (of course, I watch it with them) it is a classic that I never tire of watching.I must admit, I was a little surprised when I discovered the need to select English and NO subtitles, however, when I read the outside of the box, it made sense.I would recommend this seller, my purchase arrived quickly and in good condition.Judy Waymire"
2,Nice extras but DRM prevents it from playing on my PC,"I'd like to say the video quality was spectacular but unfortunately this Blu-ray movie won't play on my PC using ArcSoft Total Media Theater 3 Platinum. (I'm feeding it into a HDCP projector) I am just about ready to throw in the towel and buy a regular player. This may be the last Blu-Ray movie I buy. It's no wonder people are pirating movies, they play on everything!"
3,"A Classic For Kids, But Not A Great Movie","A special effects masterpiece and an interesting story, but not a classic in the likes of Citizen Kane and The Godfater series. The acting is mediocre but typical for a musical of this era. This is definitely a movie for children and I do not recommend it for adults unless they are on a nostalgia trip."
5,My red slippers in a digital show,One of my favorite movies. The special edition is great.Picture is good but what else would you expect from a dvd?
3,Oops Korean,"This is a Korean version, which has subtitles thruoughout! The movie was the classic version in English and I got it cheap, but I didn't pay attention. You can ignore the subtitles after a while, but look elsewhere for if you don't want to make the same mistake I did."
3,Expected more,"I used to have this movie on dvd, but gave it to my older sister when she was over once. Well, i bought this mistakenly thinking it also included the dvd version as one of the 2 extra discs, i guess i got confused with all the versions they offer on Blu-ray now. Anyway i don't have the dvd version anymore to directly compare the versions, but to me this Blu-ray version seems very grainy. I know it's old materials they are working with but the colors look drab and dull, and like i said it's extremely grainy looking. Certain scenes look better than others but it seems like the dvd upscaled almost as well, i'd have to buy the dvd version yet again to compare the two.I think the most surprising thing is how dull the colors look. The picture seems dark and the contrast is low overall. I guess perhaps older color films are harder to work with?"
3,Not as Good as Preview,While watching other HD video movies the advertisement for this Blu-ray movie was shown. The preview movie was razor sharp. When Amazon.com had it on sale I purchased it right away. Well the movie looks like a copy of the VHS movie put on the Blu-ray disk. Not sharp at all.
3,Don't be confused by the disk switch!,"This 2010 version of the 2005 restored dvd is advertised here on Amazon as having a different 2nd disk! The 2nd disk is not the one with the Angela Lansbury narrated special ""The Wonderful World of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic"", and the special effects on the twister, etc. It is the 3rd disk (from the 3-Disk Set) with the ""Dreamer of Oz"" TV movie, etc. You wouldn't know this by reading the description of the disks (that's where it's listed wrong). You'd have to enlarge the photo of the back of the packaging to see what's on the 2nd disk. I will keep this version only because it cost just $7.99, but now I will have to dole out some more money to get a version with the other disk. Save your money and get the 3-Disk set!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring.","If you're a fan of hammy acting and schmaltzy stories, this movie is for you. I myself hated the movie upon my first viewing of this piece of garbage when I was five. Since then I've went into convulsions everytime I hear the crappy ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" Please don't buy this movie.Simply emesis inducing."
1,(...),"What? Classic? Classic,(...). THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE. I don't ever want to watch it again. The last time I watched part of it was in 3rd grade. Yuck! It's disgusting. It's right down there with ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"", ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"", ""Licence to Kill"" and the Special Editions of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Yuck, yuck, yuck. If anyone says, ""Hey watch this film,"" schedule an immediate root canal. If anyone pays you to see it, jump into a live shark's mouth. If anyone holds a gun to your head and forces you to see it, pull the trigger."
1,So dumb,"So you think this is good eh? Well,it stinks! There is'nt much point in watching it. This movie should be a movie only babies watch. For some reason,my sister likes this movie!?! Now tell me,what could be more pointless then watching a little girl and other stupiod characters (tin man,scarecrow,etc) going to a castle where the Wizard turns them back to where they belong. Boring!Graphics 0/5The worst graphics in history. Even movies like Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer had cooler graphics. When I'm watching it,I force myself to see once I get to the castle part..... woooosssshhhh I run out of the room so I don't see this totrure.Sound 1/5The sound is okay. But difinitly not the bestOverall 0/5Whatever you do,don't buy this If you do,you are giving me your money and I'm going to buy you the Increbles. You will and I mean WILL be sorry if you by this"
2,"Still Grainy, ??Remastering?????????","I payed extra money for what assumed to be a special version of this classic(Three Disc Edition), it is fairly grainy. If this was remastered, which I doubt, it should be recalled and Warner Bros. should be honorable and freely exchange the new clean Blu Rays for the ones they offered as 70th anniversary. The colors are amazing, but the movie at times appears a bit fuzzy. It is also bothersome to find that some of the special features are on 480p standard definition - the whole set should have been in 1080p high definition, specially in view of the extra cost. I suggest to wait for the 75th anniversary to see if they can remaster this movie correctly. Keep your old DVD for now!"
2,anxious,"I have not even received my package yet. how should I know? I'm overtly excited already. the question is when will I get to watch it? but if i did, i'll surely say something better than this."
2,Defective DVD,"The Wizard of OzThe movie itself was okay but the Outtakes/Deleted Sequences, Behind the Scenes, Oz History and Oz Afterlife parts of the DVD were messed up and we were unable to watch them."
1,not what i ordered,"I thought this DVD was in Korean because of the front and the back cover, then when I put it in the DVD player,it did not work properly it also had english subtitles too. This a lousy DVD, I wish I could get my money back!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wizard of Oz,"the movie I received was from another region! Luckily I have a region free dvd player, other wise I would have been SOL."
2,Nifty,"Good movie for some kids I suppose, although I despised it when I was little. I don't know why. I can't help but giving it a low rating...I just can't stand it. HOWEVER...When played with Pink Floyds ""Dark Side of the Moon"" as the audio, I love it. Never mind kid stuff, it's scary. (To do this, make sure you find good directions)"
3,don't be fooled !,"This WIZARD OF OZ is a remake of a Black & White classic that's a rare find from 1931. The new tranfers and subsequent release by WARNER BROS is nothing but a marketing plan to take yor money. Don't destroy the experience. Keep your old copy & save your money.Besides, you've probably never even read the book, whcih is almost a wholly different experience. Dorothy is only 9 years old and they hack the talking trees down with the Tin Man's Axe. Now, I'd ay to see THAT."
5,Wizard of Oz on DVD: You'll Really Get Your Money's Worth!,"The Wizard of Oz has been one of the greatest movies in the history of the 20th Century, and continues to pursue it's magical effects in the 21st Century. This DVD version of The Wizard of Oz offers a generous helping of information about the movie and its characters -- about 1 and a half hours of pure ear-catching inquiries, or so I've heard. I have yet to watch all of its special features, having only watched half of its many bonus tracks. The movie itself I have seen many times growing up, but I have never seen it so digitally mastered as I have seen it in this DVD. Seventeen dollars for this DVD is absurd, for having very informative special features, including great sound and picture, deserves to be at least sold at a much higher price. Surely, you'll really get MORE than your money's worth!"
5,All time children's must have!!!,"Watched this every year since I was little....now bought for grandchildren as believe it is one of the all time best....and teach's them to ""have a heart, use their brain and have courage all the time""."
5,Great,You know a movie is good when you can watch it decades later and be just as entertained as watching other movies in the theatres.
4,A Timeless Classic and then some!,"I will never get tired of watching this movie, Watching it on DVD made it even more enjoyable, The picture is crisp and everything is exactly as I remember it from my childhood. The Special features help you to understand just how far ahead of their time the movie makers were. The Documentary hosted by Angela Lansbury is very informative and dispells some of the Behind-the-scenes rumors we have heard throughout the years."
5,This Movie will go on forever.Timeless,"How they made a movie in 1939 that still seems fresh today is a Classic.Judy Garland,Ray Bolger,Jack Haley,and Bert Lahr will be dancing down the yellow brick road forever. When I was a kid,I was so scared of the witch.I use to close my eyes everytime she apeared.Also,I was so bored when Bert Lahr sang,""If I was King of the Forest."" Now,its my favorite part of the movie.He's fantastic,and I laugh everytime I see this part of the film. This movie wasn't even a hit when it came out in 1939,now its every Mothers baby siter when there trying to get a break from the everyday chore of taking care of there kids. The Wizard of OZ is part of all of our lives,and all of the lives to come after us."
3,Great but missing footage.,"I bought this version because I love learning what goes on behind the scenes. This disk is full of special features. My only problem is that this copy of the movie is missing some footage. I always thought it was and when my mother-in-law watched it with my son, she mentioned that it was missing some footage. There is some parts where it cuts away from the witch in the beginning really fast as if there was something about to happen but it wasn't shown. Then, after Dorothy melts the witch, all the witch's clan and Dorothy and her friends walk around singing. This was removed. I remember seeing this on my VHS copy as a kid. Not sure what other DVDs would contain this but I'd rather buy that version instead of this one. I want to see the whole movie and not a movie that has parts missing."
5,Memory Lane,This DVD was great....just like turning on the TV and seeing it for the first time years old. My four year old grandson watches it over and over. Everyone should watch this movie and introduce it to those who haven't seen it. There is too litle JOY left in the world and this is a way to bring a little of it back home.
4,Excellent restoration and digital remastering,They have saved a classic movie masterpiece. I love it!
2,Wizard Oz Blu-ray 70th Anniversary Edition,If this movie was remastered to Blu-ray I was very disappointed. The Movie is very grainy. So if you are buying this expecting to get a very clear remastered film for the blu-ray do not buy this movie.
3,The Wizard of Oz,"Great movie, my 6 year old son had never seen the movie, just a play and bugged me till I finally found him the movie. This movie has great color and sound, the only thing I did not like is it did'nt come from the USA. There are subtitles that you have to turn off. Import- all region is right in your face, no matter if you like it or not."
4,Like the old days,"I am a total Oz fan, and enjoy the DVD. The only problem is that there are one or two 'glitches' in the actual movie. Not enough to send it back or not watch, just a little irritating at times."
3,Korean subtitles threw me off,"I looked long and hard for a ""new""(not used) DVD and it was tough. I stumbled onto this, got a fair price and good delivery. But I was sure surprised with the sub titles. But I did figure out how to rid myself of them so all worked out."
4,Not a Texan!!,"This book was interesting and I did like it. After saying that, I just had to write this review to let everyone know that people from Texas do know how to use correct grammar! Being born and raised a Texan, I know that you do not use the word ""Ya'll"" when speaking to ONE, I repeat, ONE person. You just say ""You."" The word ""Ya'll"" is Texan for ""You All."" That is more than one person, people! You can tell that this writer is from New York City and does not know the correct usage of this word because it is in nearly every other sentence that the hero says whether it should be there or not. This got on my nerves so bad that every time I saw the writer do this I had to grit my teeth. And also, if the hero had wanted to ride horses in the first place he would have done it on the horse ranch where he grew up, don't ya'll think?"
1,Car wash brush,Flimsly made. Head snapped off after the first use. Obviously not designed by anyone with any technical knowledge as even a little common sense and no additional cost could have produced a reliable product.
3,"Good ""extended"" cleaner !","I wanted something to better clean my ""park model"" trailer- without having to climb a ladder & scrub every inch-by hand with a scrubbrush- again. This looked like a great idea! It is! Better, cleaner, safer & much faster! A ""bargain"" in every way! Thanks!"
1,The most useless Midi controller I own.,"I really hate this controller. It looked like it was going to be a good fit for somethings I wanted to do in Ableton but it never quite worked.The AutoMap will launch in its own window every time anything that supports Midi is started. On my system if I open GarageBand AutoMap will load, and if I close it sometimes GarageBand will crash. I uninstalled AutoMap for a while but the controller became even more useless. Recently I thought I would use it with DMXIS software for managing my DMX lights, it looks similar to a lot of lighting controllers... but no. DMXIS can use most MIDI interfaces including my Dicer but the Zero SL is unrecognized even with AutoMap reinstalled and updated.Maybe it works better on a PC, maybe it works better with other applications, maybe if I spent a bunch more time trying to configure it I could find a use for it..."
4,Great quality,"These are great high heeled shoes but unfortunately the run a little small. I usually wear a 10.5 and I ordered an 11 in these yet they are still tight. The quality is excellent, just wish they fit a little better."
5,Best Heals!!,"I have to agree with the other reviewer M. Penny. I have worn these shoes to work for the last 4 years, I am a flight attendant so I do LOTS of walking. They are the most comfortable shoe I own (and like most women I own a ton!) I get compliments on them all the time. I just can not find another shoe that compares so i take them to the shoe repair and fix the heal when it wears down."
5,Classic black pumps,"I bought these to wear to work, and they are such a classic look. They are more comfortable than I expected and I wear them all the time. I would highly recommend these if you are looking for this kind of shoe. I wear a size 5 and was lucky to find them! Highly recommend."
2,SAFE AND THEY BUY MY PRODUCT IN A SHORT TIME.,"Yamaha PSR340 61-Note Touch-Sensitive Portable Electronic KeyboardADQUIRI ESTE PEODUCTO POR AMAZON Y SIN DUDA FUE LA MEJOR COMPRA QUE PUDE HACER, EL PRODUCTO LLEGO RAPIDO Y COMO LO DESCRIBIA EL VENDEDOR, MUCHAS GRACIAS POR EL SERVICIO Y COMPREN CON CONFIANZA, BUEN DÍA..."
2,Kensington has better products,I bought this based largely on the mention in TIME magazine. My wife got a Contour by Kensington. Overall the contour seemed to be much more sturdy with more space and a far more comfortable padding system on the back. I sent mine back and got my own Contour and I would recommend you do the same.
2,"Up to but not including 17"" notebooks","My 17"" computer did not fit into the sleeve in the backback--better for smaller than 17"" computers."
1,Nice case but!!,"THis case will not hold a dell e1705 17inch wide screen. If you try you can get it in, but the velcro flap won't cover, and it really distorts the bag. get the targus 17inch instead"
2,Kensington 62232 SaddleBag,"The backpack functionality is very nice, but the laptop part is not, especially if you have a 17"" laptop. This pack was used to carry a 17"" HP laptop and the sleeve tore during just a couple uses. This bag might have lasted if it was used on a 15"" laptop. I will not purchase another like this."
4,comfortable but zippers need work,"I bought this bag because i needed to haul my laptop out of the country with me. I found it to be very comfortable and i loved the million pockets to put every little thing i could think of in. However the zippers don't move smoothly, one is already completely broken and a few more are a struggle to get open and shut. Other than that the bag is well built, nicely cushioned, and well balanced."
1,"No Answers, Poor Print Quality","This workbook has no answers to any of its exercises, even though it has ""Answers to Exercises"" listed in its table of contents.Also, print quality is so poor that it is difficult to tell the 3 from the 6 or 8 much of the time. Some of the time, print quality is so poor that it is even difficult to tell the 2 from the 3."
5,The One and Only,"This is the finest apologetics document available anywhere, written at the height of the so-called ""reformation.""St. Francis De Sales destroys Protestantism in this book. Nothing is sugar coated while the saint boldly and effectively proclaims what well catechized Catholics already know: that the Catholic church is the one true Church established by Christ, where and only where exists the fullness of Christianity.The material in this book was responsible for converting thousands of separated brothers and sisters during the ""reformation"" period, away from the errors of Protestantism and back to the one true (Catholic) faith.The language is dated, but its meaning is timeless. This book is a must have for any Catholic Christian interested in learning more about their faith and how to defend it."
5,So far so good,"I appreciate the price of the battery as well as the speed in which it arrived, and most of all it works. thanks!"
5,GE Cordless Phone Battery,I own an older Uniden cordless phone and I can't find a battery for it in the stores. I was so relieved to find a compatible battery on-line and that they work! The battery was shipped immediately and I got it within a few days. I'm very satisfied with the product and how my order was handled. I highly recommend the product and the company.
1,battery chemistry wrong,"Be careful not to buy a NiCd battery for a charger set for Ni-MH !!! The unit could overheat because the correct charging current is higher on the Ni-MH. The original battery BT-446 said Ni-MH on the label, and this GE is clearly labelled NiCd."
2,Wrong size,"Wrong size for the Uniden phones I was trying to fit - too wide. The Amazon guides said they would work and they were a great price, but..."
5,good so far,Great price and does the job. It was completely dead when it arrived but a full charge did the trick and it's working great.
4,Works well,"I can trust the battery to work well. Every I purchased i make at amazon is always of great quality,Great service,"
4,Seems to work,Had a bit of trouble installing this one as plug is a slight bit larger than last battery which was the exact same battery! But finally got it installed and seems to work fine.
2,"Wrong battery, not enough information.",Item did not give enough information. This battery did not fit in the telephone battery compartment
1,photos can be deceiving,"Though the item number and photo matched the battery which came with my GE 5.8GHz cordless phone (and I verified against the GE website also) but when it arrived, the connection which fits into the phone, (which looks the same in the photo as my old battery,) was actually larger and did not fit. I was afraid to push it thinking it would break the phone and then I'm out a phone. Also I hate to pay $5 for shipping for such an inexpenve item from a local site. So now I'm out that money also. I think this vendor should make this right for the customer."
5,Correction to the quotation from JEI,"I was the reviewer for this book in the Journal of Electronic Imaging.The quotation from my review in JEI as it appears on this site should read:""...a worthwhile addition to the armamentarium of any serious researcher in image science and will be an oft-quoted reference for many years to come."" (Journal of Electronic Imaging, April-June 2005)The corrections pertains to the word, oft-quoted, which has, for some reason, appeared as ""opt-quoted"" on this site in addition to the reference, ""Journal of Electronic Imaging"" instead of ""Journal of Electrical Imaging""This book, of course, is outstanding as I have stated in my review in the JEI."
3,misleading cover,"The title twice a hero really refers to Mac- (Mackenzie), the heroine of the novel- not the hero. I found this a refreshing change.She time travels back in time- not only meets a man, but has to matchmake her number of times great grandparents to each other!Also there is danger- someone wants to kill the man she loves. Unfortunely he thinks it her numerous time great grandfather who is trying to kill him, and he intends to marry her numerous times great grandmother.I gave the book only three stars even though the plot was great because the book draged in places and the writing could have been somewhat better."
5,Worth giving a try!,An excellent read. Character development was good- but left me wanting to know more about some of the ancillary players. It waned a bit about 2/3's through but overall the story line maintained a steady move forward in plot. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a change of location and time.
2,National Geographic Video Lacking in Compelling Footage,"I was once again disappointed with a tsunami documentary which lacked much actual film footage. Instead, the program is padded with close-ups of ordinary beach waves, better suited for a surfing documentary. This is not only disappointing, but scientifically inaccurate, since tsunami rarely appear as conventional waves, but usually as tumultuous floods or walls of water. I continue to be puzzled at the seeming dearth of video documentation of this fascinating natural phenomena. After all, National Geographic sends intrepid photgraphers to the rims of volcanoes, chasing tornadoes, and flying into hurricanes. There are warning systems that can predict potential landfall for tsunami, so why don't scientists wait for them in helicopters with video cameras? But for an organization like National Geographic to depict tsunami as large surfing waves is surprising and misinforming."
1,Wrong Item,"The book I was shipped was the wrong item and not even close to what I ordered, and I was not given information to ship the book back. They did however refund my money as they did not have a copy of the book. I have no use for the book I was sent and really wanted the book I ordered. Now I have to reorder the book and wait for it to arrive."
4,Smells amazing!,"The smell of this is amazing! Sometimes I just have a craving to open the tin and just smell it. However, Lip balm wise it is not the best. Mostly I use it when I just want a pick me up from the super cute tin and the amazing smell, but it always ends up leaving my lips feeling dried out. It is worth my lips being dried out though just because the smell."
4,add-on grill,I purchased 2 of the Meco 9303w grills for backup of my other gas and charcoalgrills. I have enjoyed cooking on the grill and use it much more than expected.It is so easy to cook a smaller amount without lighting up one of the other grills.I put one at the office and we will have deer burgers today for lunch.
4,Meco 9309w Grill,"Use this item @ my Fla Condo - can't use a gas grille. This grille is good for the money - couldn't beat the price anywhere & shipping was prompt. Compared to other electric grilles ( Weber, patio chef etc.) that I shopped for at the box stores there's no difference in what they all can do & Meco quality is as good if not better than most. The Meco takes a while to heat up (approx.10 - 15mins) but does a good job after it has. The drip pan is finicky to get out & not easy to clean as everything really gets baked on. Covering it with heavy gauge tinfoil solves that problem. As well the shiny side of the tin foil helps in the pre-heating process & cooking. The porcelain grille needs to be sprayed with a cooking oil as, again, things really stick to it due to the proximity of the cooking element. It's not as good as a gas grille but what electric grille is. For balcony situations it's ideal & I'd buy it again."
1,this thing is a piece of crap,WARPED ELEMENTS AND AFTER ABOUT 12 USES NO MORE HEAT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUY THE WEBER ELECTRIC GRILL. MANUFACTURER IGNORED COMPLAINTS.
5,Great GRILL,"We have an older Meco electric and just loved it, we wanted to upgrade to a barbi am well satified both with the grill and the shipment method, very timely thanks"
5,Perfect for balconies that don't allow gas or charcoal,"I bought this for my condo because you can't have gas or charcoal grills on balconies there. I'm so glad I did because I've had both of the other kinds of grills before and this thing is way easier to use and the food comes out tasting just as good or better than the other grilling methods. I will likely never buy a different type of grill. This is the 2nd one I have had. The 1st one lasted about 3 years. That isn't bad considering I live on the Gulf of Mexico and the salt air was constantly eating on it. If I lived inland, it would have lasted much longer."
1,HURTS!!,"i decided to use the murine ear wax removal and boy do i regret using it!!i read the positive reviews and decided to try it myself following the instructions carefully.hours later my eardrums were in constant sharp pain!! i read up on some other reviews from other websites and have noticed that many others have had similar symptoms but they all recovered by the following day, which was the same for me.I will prob never use this product again. Maybe i was one of the few that had reactions to murine. im sure it worked for others but unfortunately it did not for me. i am not sure as to why my ears hurt so badly but i can not take the chance and reuse this product."
3,This didn't work for me,"For some reason, it didn't seem to work for me. I did love the cleaner that comes with the kit. For the price, it is a good kit."
1,Terrible!!!!!!,I bought this ear wax removal because I've had a hard time hearing for the past year. I put the drops in at 11:30 pm and woke up at 3 am with the worst pain I've ever experienced in my ear!!!!! I was in tears and was tempted to go to the emergency room. I looked up online if other people have experienced this and they have. So I took a few Tylenol and woke up in the morning with no pain. It was the most terrifying experience I've ever had!!!Do not use these ear drops!!!!!!! I'm telling you it's a very scary experience!!!!!
4,Effective way to remove ear wax,"After not cleaning my ears for 30+ years (I'm ear shy), I couldn't hear out of my right ear. So I decided to use Murine Ear Wax Removal System. First night I used it, nothing but Murine came out of my ear. I was pretty disappointed. The next morning I used it and it made my stuffed ear worse! Then I used it again at night. Why the hell not? I put the drops in my ear and waited 10 minutes like I did other times. But this time, when I went to flush it out, little bits of wax came out initially. And then bigger and bigger pieces. It was pretty gross but I could hear out of my right ear again! This product works, but you have to be patient with it. It takes some time for I guess the drops to penetrate your ear wax enough to remove it.Also, the flushing process made me pretty dizzy even though I used body temperature water. So I would do it with someone else around in case you do pass out."
4,Does the Trick,"I had been an avid user of que-tip brand ear cleaning cotton tools and have never had a problem before until several months ago. For a week I went around with a partial hearing loss in my right ear. After some research I began to think I had wax build up.I went with this product in all honesty because it was one of the cheaper one available, but I have to say it does the trick. The box arrived on a thursday and after daily use by monday my hearing was even better than before! I now use the product usually two to three times a month sense and have not had any more problems.I do recommend using warm water although, I too have proven that cold water can lead to shock and possible vomiting."
4,Excellent,"At first I didn't think this product was going to work. I also wasn't sure how long to leave the drops in my ear before flushing with water with the soft bulb washer. No clear instructions are given on the packaging. I experimented a little and flushed repeatedly with the washer as, even though nothing appeared to be happening, it was very soothing for my ear (warm water works best I think). The washer is a definite plus rather than just ear-drops on their own. I started with the product late on Tuesday and by mid morning Thursday managed to flush the offending wax out of my ear (wouldn't have happened with ear drops alone). Saved me a visit to the doctor and I would definitely use this product again if necessary."
1,A ripoff .Murine should stick to EYECARE.,"WHAT A RIPOFF. I bought two boxes of this product,and used it as directed.It DID NOT REMOVE ANY WAX out of my ears at all."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"After reading the rave customer reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try and used it exactly as directed. Nothing happened. I'm so disappointed. The only thing good about it was the price, that I didn't lose much money because of it. If I thought it would do any good, I'd return the product to the company and ask for my money back. Would not recommend it to anyone. Such a let down."
1,PAINFUL,"I used it on just one ear and put in 3 drops. Went to bed and woke up with excruciating ear pain. Two hours later still pain, 400 MG motrin still pain, I then flushed my ear with hot water. Less pain but NEVER AGAIN! Im headed to the dr in the morning."
4,PPST in the Fast Lane,"If your short on time to prepare for the PPST, or you have a higher skill level than average and do not need as much detailed instruction, this book is for you. The tutorials are short and to the point and provide instruction along the path to successful study. The book is a great resource for math formulas, grammatical rules, and study skills. Practice test are provided in the book and there is a great CD version included that can easily be used to practice for the CBT test. Be aware that the test format on the CD (mulitiple choice) does not follow the exact format of the CBT (multiple choice, fill in the blank, cut and paste, highlighting)."
4,I can get creeped out by Outer Limits again!,"I got this for my husband for Christmas this year and we are having a blast watching all these old episodes again. And even though they are 40 years old, they still manage to give me the heebie jeebies! My only complaint is that these disks are two-sided which I find pretty annoying. No matter which side I put in, inevitably, it's the wrong side for the episode I want."
5,history,The first episode made it all worth while. A lesson that applies now. It really happened here. they fooled me.
3,Second best anthology series (after Twilight Zone),OL went through two producers but it stayed uniformly good throughout! A word of caution! Eps liek Demon With A Glass Hand (starring Bob Culp and filmed in the same set later used for the film Bladerunner) are slightly too intense for young children!
4,The DVD set is wonderful - great for old time sci fi fans.,"I received The Outer Limits DVD Set as a Christmas gift. The DVD set is wonderful - great for old time sci-fi fans. Many now well-known actors appeared in The Outer Limits such as Robert Culp, Leonard Nimoy, Ivan Dixon, Martin Landau, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman, etc. It was funny seeing The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Illya Kuryakin/NCIS's Ducky with a huge head. This set has brought back many childhood memories although the series was short-lived. I had no problem with the DVD's playing and they loaded well (at least the first DVD). The packaging is not good at all. The DVD's are not marked and the box is very chintzy. I don't expect the box to last long even though I take good care of my things. All in all, I am pleased with the set. I would have given it 5 stars if the packaging was better."
5,awesome?,It was just what they wanted for Xmas! Thank you. The item was in perfect condition and play extremely well.
1,"Some Defective Two Sided Discs in "" The Outer Limits Series ""","I purchased these discs a few years back and buyer beware, some of the discs were defective and would not play back. There is something wrong with their two-sided recording process. I tried the defective discs in two different machines and there is nothing wrong with the machines. MGM would not cover the the problem they created.If I could make one recommendation, check all the discs the day that a buyer receives them.I am very disappointed!"
3,"The good, the bad and the awful episodes of the Outer Limits.",I was very excited when I purchased this old classic show. I knew I had seen some good and bad episodes years ago. I figured I would get into the series as it went along. Unfortunately I found that I often fell asleep in many of the espisodes. Some stories are pretty decent while others are simply dreadful relying on stupid monsters or some hokey dimension monster or some energy creature etc. I have the first five seasons of the New Outer Limits and it is by far the better product. It seems the problem with the original series was simply the weak sci-fi writing. The writers simply didn't know where they were going with a lot of the original stories. They didn't seem to know how to flesh out the ideas. So for the classic episodes that are in this collection I will give the show three stars but I can give only three stars because many episodes are simply tedious and dreadful.
1,no in spanish,very be careful!!! You can read in the amazon web that The Outer Limits has lenguage in spanish. That's is not true. Only in english. if you buy it you must return
5,one of the best of all time,"The outer limits, was in both decades that it was shown one of the most intelligent sci fi shows ever created. Of course the 1990's version has digital effects and the sixties version has more primitive effects. Still the 1960's stories are brilliant moral plays and lessons written by the best sci fi writers in the business at the time. The acting is all first class and filled with true artists, even the directors are top notch. Few series are this good overall and in spite of it's age and lack of color , it's the stories that matter , even if one could hope for a digital effect option on these early 1960's stories the effects are still good enough to be effective to the storyline. This show is a anthology show of different stories; a format that isn't around much these days. Which is a shame and is why someone should bring back the outer limits for a third time!."
1,Cheaper to buy individual series,"I'm going to hold off buying these until they're properly remastered. But if you must get them now, buying the individual series is cheaper at amazon's current sale price (3x14.99 each) than this ""package""."
4,Outer Limits Orig Series Complete Set,"Do not attempt to adjust your television-because the quality of the DVDs are just perfect. Watching the Outer Limits in the 21st century as an adult was definitely a completely different experience than what I remembered from having watched it as a child in the 1960s. However, it was thoroughly enjoyable both times-although for different reasons. What was once an exciting glimpse into our possible future is now a funny, nostalgic look back at our naivete and tolerance of really bad acting and writing. Buy it-you won't regret it."
2,some episodes won't play,"I'm not through watching all the episodes yet, but was upset to find that three episodes on the second disc of the first season would not play on my player. Apparently this is not an isolated complaint. The content of the episodes is not in question. The quality of the recording is."
3,Outer Limits is limited,"THE OUTER LIMITS-THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL SERIESThis is, without a doubt, one of the best series ever on television. Some reviews complain that there are no closed captions, but that is a minor problem. My only serious complaint is that while all of the episodes are listed on each plastic container, some episode are NOT, in fact, available. For example, on Disc One, episodes 33-40, the information says that Side B contains four episodes, beginning with the classic, ""Demon With the Glass Hand"". That side has only two episodes instead of the listed four. There are other strange exclusions with no warning. There are no liner notes to explain these exclusions.BUT, as a series, The Outer Limits had some of the best writing and (occasional) acting for its time. For truly creepy and scary atmospherics, this can't be beat. The productions are magnificent, even with the obvious budgetary restrictions faced by the creators. Some are masterpieces of ""film noir"". All in all, a joy to watch."
1,WARNING,I loved this series as a child. As previously stated by other reviewers I also wanted to own this as some of the other reviewers. These discs are absolutely corrupted and after a very short period of time fade away and become unplayable. This is not amazons fault but the manufactur. You will be dissapointed. Buying more of the discs will not help. I recommend amazon stop selling the outer limits until they are done produced by a reputable disc maker.
1,Disappointed,I picked this set up at Best Buys on December 20. The picture was crisp and the sound fine until Episode 3 on Disc number 1. The picture started sticking and the audio disappeared all together. I replaced this set with a new one at a different store. All was good until episode 3 on disc 2 exhibited the same problem. I do have a relatively new DVD player with progressive scan and still had this problem. Having watched this series religiously as a child I was so excited when this box set was released and now so disappointed. In this case 3rd time is not the charm and I now have a store credit.
3,bad copies,"this set contained poor,vhs pirate quality recording on many episodes,you should take into consideration the fact.Good price but poor quality.many were a pain to watch, very distorted and filled with snow like bad tv reception during analog day's of television.but i can't offer any suggestion aside from net flix to see if it is in manufacter or existing copy problem."
5,Sci-Fi At it's Best,"This Series takes me back to the early 60's when you had to get up off the chair & change the channel to your favorite show. I remember this was the last show I could watch before I had to go to bed. I used to say ""Wait dad maybe they'll have a preview of next weeks show"". There are episodes I hadn't seen in years & really enjoyed them. DVD transfer is excellent, as good or better than watching each week on tv. Beginning is a little corny with "" Don't adjust your DVD player"" but when episode starts it's complete just like the original. I thought it was a cheap price for the complete set especially if it's one of your favorite shows. Hat's off for having the complete set available & at a great price. Hoping Twilight Zone & Night Gallery become available at an affordable price one of these days. By the way if your wondering about that REAL FAST closeup of the moon thats one of our early probes taking pictures before crashing. Happy viewing"
4,Delightful,A must have for anyone of scots descent. Lots of beautiful prints and swatches.. and insightful anecdotes that makes any tartan wearing descendant swell with pride. Good family reference.
2,Not what I expected,"This is not the same Knorr chicken noodle soup that I used to buy in the grocery store. Instead, the noodles in this soup are round and shaped like short pieces of spaghetti. The noodles are toasted, which gives them a texture identical to whole wheat noodles. The broth is somewhat tangy and if you like whole wheat noodles you will like this product, but if you don't, do not buy this product. I would have appreciated the inclusion of ""toasted noodles"" on the product description because I would not have purchased this product if I had this information."
3,Nice,"This is very nice, the pendant hanging down is not as long as it looks in the picture but I still like it, the price was right."
4,Wore in my wedding,"Beautiful and GREAT quality. Sparkled in every photo taken.Only downside is the chain was a little cheap so I put it on anothr chain. Earrings were a great addition to wear as well!I love wearing this knowing if by chance I lose it, its not $1000. (but it definately looks like it!)"
3,Better things were to come from Gallagher soon after this...,"Though released in 1972, Taste had already split up long before this album was released. Gallagher's first solo album 'Rory Gallagher' (truly excellent) was released in 1971 and I believe Taste had disbanded in late 70 or early 71. This album perhaps shows one of the reasons why Gallagher broke up the band - Wilson (drums) and McCracken (bass) were just not good enough. They really struggle to make any presence felt behind Gallaghers furious playing.One for serious collectors of Gallaghers music only. You'll only play it once!"
2,This is Not Good! Rory was Right to Sack these Guys....,"This is an embarrassing disc in the fine Rory G. canon. He's out of tune on almost every cut, and the poor playing of the other two guys in the band shows you why Rory dumped them for better players. The lengthy blues numbers have every bad cliche of that era. Fans of Rory are directed to Irish Tour '74 as a superior example of Rory at his best....."
4,Better Than You Think,"Taste were better than even Rory Gallagher's die hard fans credit them. Maybe the rhythm section wasn't always able to stay with Gallagher's blues fancies, but when they had it locked in they were capable of some subtly incendiary music. It earned them the opening spot for Cream's farewell gig at the Royal Albert Hall, London, and by the sound of what they were caught doing here, for the most part they deserved it."
5,Huggies Natural Fit Rules!,"For my son, we were fans of Pampers Cruisers, but this time around, with a girl, Huggies Supreme Natural Fit seems to work better. We did buy the regular Huggies from Costco once but I did not find it as soft or absorbent as the Natural Fit version. Since it's a hassle to lug a big box of diapers home from the grocery store, I decided to get it delivered monthly from Amazon. Wow, what a time and cost savings!"
2,Big Disappointment,"Okay, so I'm like a lot of moms out there and thought that I'd give this product a try. I must say that these diapers are definitely not worth the extra $$ and I'll stick with just plain ol' Pampers from now on.My complaint is not with leaking but with the dye that is used to decorate the outside of the diaper. The dye rubs off onto my baby's skin and the inside of her clothes. Unfortunately, it is hard to remove from her skin without a bit of scrubbing (which of course, I hate to do because her skin is a bit sensitive). Cute pooh bear designs are nice but I could do without them."
5,WINGO,"Well cats this is it. This is the Wes you want. Swinging, hip, and utterly musical. Solo on Cariba take 2 is one of those magic solos that is just transcendent."
5,Great resource for the classroom!,"Unlike Schindler's List, in Divided Lives, a book by Cynthia Crane, the reader is able to put a face with a name and learn about personal experiences before, during, and after the war. No longer are these people just statistics, but they are actual people who had a life that was turned upside down by the Holocaust. Divided Lives is the type of resource that could be used in schools, especially high school, to show the truth about what Holocaust victims went through day after day and the effects it had on the rest of their lives. Divided Lives not only shows students about the uniqueness of this period in history, but children can also connect on an emotional level and learn an appreciation for their own lives and the human race."
5,Captivating Reading,"Very captivating reading - couldn't put the book down! These are poignant and concise testimonies of German-Jewish women who suffered under the Third Reich - they did not experience the concentration camps, but were persecuted in some form because of their Jewish heritage. Cynthia Crane does a masterful job of bringing the experiences of these women home to those of us who have not experienced such persecution. The eye-opening accounts portrayed here make us see that the line that distinguished Jews from Germans was indeed a very difficult one to draw. Crane explores the resultant identity crises of women who had always considered themselves as patriotic Germans but then all of a sudden had to endure the shame of being outcasts in a society they had come to know and love. She offers a relatively heretofore unexplored perspective of Holocaust studies in that she shows us that being German and being Jewish were not necessarily mutually exclusive entities."
5,Perfect In every way,"Great brand new product, fast speedy service if you need to buy this product this is the place to go."
5,Longest Last Operating System,"I still want to use this Operating System, because of OpenGL support for 3D application and games, starting with Windows 2000 or NT, microsoft has modified it's driver which make the OpenGL low grammer, I think microsoft is trying to eliminate some free programming opensource for everyone, I like to use this operating system if someone continue to use it for such game as Quake 3 1.16 freeze rail and AMD software cool program runs fine, I hope someone makes Operating System from this windows 98 base to add features without making programmers reprogram their software to support the OS, let me know if u can make windows 98 look modern and cool with new win98 os win98@LeMinhMan.com"
5,Nice replacement!1,This item arrived quickly. It arrived in excellent condition. It worked exactly like it was supposed to. The item met a special need very well. Thank you Amazon for having it.
3,Did not work for my system,Not really sure how it works we got windows 2008 server and this did not work with it. I sent it back and got a refund. The company was great about it.
4,MacBook 98,Not bad. Windows 98 will work on most modern Intel computers. It can run both the old and new applications for the most part. Go to CNET.com if you have driver issues.
4,Windows 98se,I installed Win 98se within Win 7 OS using VM Ware emulation software in order to run a legacy DOS application. It works very well!
2,Windows 2000 or XP is much better!,Windows 98 is much better than Windows 95.2000 or XP is really the way to go if you have the hardware for it.
5,Windows 98 SE,I ordered this product on a Monday and received that week on Friday. Shipping was on time and the shipper even sent an email to let me know he received my request for the item.Very Good!
5,Great shopping,Seller was very fast and efficient. I would deal with him again.He was exceptionally helpful with my questions regarding the product that I purchased from him. A GREAT GUY!
1,Two thumbs down!,"Do not buy Windows98 unless you absolutely have to, and are prepared for a let-down. Although setup started automatically and the installation seemed to progress flawlessly, my pc only gets the blue screen of death on post-install startup. I can't even start in safe mode. My pc is totally disabled, as previous Win95 was over-written. This should not happen in such an ""advanced"" software. I do not recommend this product; in fact, I strongly recommend against it."
3,Unstable OS Needs More,I rate this three stars because it is faulty it throws up blue windows and we got a new computer because are old one was screwed up so then it had windows 98 SE. on it and this computer is well able to support windows 98 700 MGH. 130 MGS. of ram and a 40 GB. 7200 RPM Hard drive and i have still run in to a few small problems i would not use or install this on any small computer under 300.mgh it is a suprise that windows ME does a much better job at small and large computers if you are trying to decide between Windows Me Or Windows 98 i would go with WINDOWS ME trust me i have run windows 98 for Four years!
1,Still waiting,My original order was placed on 4/28/09 for Windows 98 SE. I received Windows XP which will not run on the computer I am working on. A to z cables contacted me and said they would send out Windows 98 SE and I would send back the copy of Windows XP. As of 5/29/09 I have not received Windows 98 SE. Good luck in dealing with these people.
1,Complaint,I have not received the product. I have sent a couple of e-mail inquires to the seller but I have not received a response. I am very concerned because in addition to paying for the product I also provided the seller with my debit card number.Fidel Guerrero
3,"Bad Steam, Bad Customer Service","After 8 years with a really great steamer that finally gave out, I purchased the above steamer. Big mistake. It worked o.k. for the first two months, and then would not hold the time punched in and would not reset. Have contacted their customer service 2 times with no responce at all. Will chuck this one and try another company, but will check out customer service on any one I purchase. I will never purchase a Rival product again."
1,Crap Crap Crap,"As others have said...this thing worked for a few times. Then it started to shut off after a few minutes. The instructions said this meant it was low on water, but it clearly indicated it had plenty of water. It is now trash and I will find a different brand."
5,Great Steamer,It is so easy to use and the 8-Quart size is big enough for me to steam 2 fishes at the same time. Love the product. Will recommend it to anyone who is interested to get a steamer.
1,quit working--just like others have said,"Just like others have posted, ours worked great for a couple of months but now it shuts off after 1-3 minutes. Junk. Junk. Junk. Very disappointing. Probably won't ever buy a Rival product again because of this experience."
1,It broke after a few months of use....,"Save the box it came in, UPC code, proof of purchase, etc... This product worked for a while and then started to time-out before the set cook time. it doesn't stay on for more than a minute. Broken!"
2,Breaks Down Quickly,"Love using this type of cooking for many foods - from fish to veggies, warming up leftovers like pasta dishes excellent, defrosting berries, etc. Especially love the fact you don't have to watch it - it rings a bell to tell you when done - BUT it breaks down too quickly. Have purchased 3 of them over the last 3 years - seems like the heat sensing core doesn't stand up to constant daily use, or long steaming sessions, and never works right again if one forgets to put the water in - very unforgiving even tho it does shut itself off and supposedly able to handle this emergency"
4,Good info once you get past all the unnecessary 'chatter',"Webster offers good suggestions on preparing, and does a decent job explaining the how and the whys of Y2K. Especially thought provoking are the different scenerios and the odds of any given one happening. Spends way too much time pontificating and discussing the politics of the subject. If this were to be left out, the book would be halved, with concise information"
3,Just a joke,"I only want to buy this book for a joke, so that twenty years later, when nothing has happened because of the Y2K bug, I will be able to show people that book and say how gullible people were back in '99. I think it's funny to read a book like that that tells you to fill your house with canned food for a disaster that doesn't exist."
3,"Fun, interesting take on environmental changes","Though I agree that this book was a bit slow in spots, in general it was inovative and worth the read. There were some original ideas and plenty of nice prose."
3,Long but good,This is a pretty good book. The science is very thorough. The prose itself is a little long and involved. The ending is a lot bland.
1,"Poop I mean poor, no I mean both",Tarp is so thin it came ripped I patched it up and hope it can last one winter covering my chip truck
3,It was better than the old one,"This battery pack was better than the old one which was only holding a charge for about an hour. But this one only held a charge for about 5 hours and when I first purchased the phone with new batteries, it would hold a charge a whole day or more."
1,Glorified garbage,"Did some past reviewer say this record was historic? For what? The worst album in history, perhaps?These guys stink now and they stunk on this record. What's scary, however, is that this is probably Bon Jovi's best piece of work. At least this album had some semblance of subtelty. Future BJ projects paved the way for Posion and the like.SUPPORT GOOD MUSIC, DON'T HYPE THIS OVERRATED BAND.LATER!"
3,Your Typical 80's hair band album,"Another cd I bought as recomendation from Amazon. Not a hard strecth since I'm a pretty big Bon Jovi fan. This was the only album I hadn't purchased of their's from the 80's. It's very fitting of the era of hair bands and sounds pretty much like most other 80's hair band albums.I'm not ripping the album, but it could be better. However, if you enjoy Bon Jovi you will like this album. If you don't like Bon Jovi you probably won't like this album. It's that cut and dry. I believe they don't even play any of these songs on tour, and if they do it'd be a miracle. There aren't too many songs on here that don't sound like other songs from other artist of the hair band era.In and Out of Love is probably the only song that's ok, and you can get that one of their other CDs. So unless you love Bon Jovi this probably isn't the CD for you."
5,awesome,"been in love with this album for quite some time now, and trying to catch up with modern technology and replacing my cassettes with cds LOL, even though the band considers this one of their worst albums, i absolutely love it!"
3,A different band!,"This is not the band, you think you'll get, when you already got ""these days"" or ""destination...."" this is the classical 80's pop rock, not deep, bout loud. This was my first self-bought album, that's the main reason why i like it. Plus, it contains the best bon jovi song of all times, TOKYO ROAD. Fans, forget the charts orientated new stuff, get the REAL rock here!"
3,Good Classic 80's Metal,"This is the ultimate 80's hair metal band, and if you like this era, this CD is a must have...loud guitars, pounding drums, and of course, lot's of hair..."
2,Not Their Best Work,"I'm a huge fan of Bon Jovi and own seven of their albums which I listen to almost continuously. I find each one amazing and refreshing in it's own way, except 7800 degrees Fahrenheit. Although ""In and Out of Love"" was a decent song, most of the album falls flat with inconsistancy of the music and lyrics sadly devoid of the talent displayed on Bon Jovi's other recordings. So unless you're determined to collect all of their albums, I'd say you could skip on this one and go straight to the good stuff, meaning just about anything else!"
5,I love this album!,"First off, let me just say I'm a psychotic, for lack of a better word, Bon Jovi fan. I have been for many years now.I've wanted this album for such a long time and was so happy to finally get it. In my opinion, its one of their better albums. I find it hard to believe that the band thinks its one of their worst. What made me want the album the most was the song Only Lonely. Others I absolutely love are The Price of Love, The Hardest Part is the Night, Always Run to You, and Secret Dreams. Personally, I think all those should have been released as singles because they are just that good. Although, their next album Slippery When Wet was more mature, 7800 was just as good.But their subsequent albums were awesome. I throughly enjoyed this album, I've listened to it nonstop since I got it. The song quality is amazing.I LOVE THIS ALBUM,I hope you do too."
4,A deeper look at Chakotay,"This book continues Captain Chakotay's command of Voyager, albeit with a slightly new crew and a lot less of Janeway than I would have liked. It also explores his family in a way that the series did not. All in all a good read!"
4,"It's still ST:Voyager, but with that lemony twist.","Though I was estatic when I opened the book for the first time, I soon realized it wasn't quite the same without more Janeway. Though (now) Admiral Janeway plays a part in the book, I just don't feel like she is suited to the role she now finds herself in. After all, two things that really set Voyager apart was that fact that it was Janeway in command, and they were lost in the Delta quadrant. While the book is good, the new characters leave a little to be desired. Not a whole lot of depth to them, but we hope to see the new Voyager crew develop over time! The plot is 100% original, and is good. The second book (enemy of my enemy) really ends on a note that is exciting, though a little confusing, and a copule loose ends to tie up. I would buy the next new voyager book that ties into this series, but I don't think I'd be inclinded to rush out and pay full price."
5,Post VoyagerNovel,Though I haven't gotten to read it yet I am very happy that this series of novels taks place AFTER Voyager's return to the Delta Quadrant. I always thought a movie should be made but a series in books is just fine.
3,Keep hoping it will get better,"""Old Wounds"" is the first book in the Spirit Walk series and the third book in Voyager ""Re-lunch series."" Chakotay is now the new captain of Voyager, who has been given the task of taking some colonist back to their home planet. But things are not like they seem on both Voyager and the planet. Now Chakotay and his sister will both have to face some the Alpha quadrent's darkest memories if they are going to survive.I keep hoping with each book that the Voyager relunch will improve, but it didn't. I still find that the storyline invovling Libby Webster to be just unblievible. I would also that Ms. Golden would back Voyager characters the reader miss. Die-hard will more than likly enjoy but other might was to skip this book."
3,Surprise Find,"I found this book on the returns trolley at my local library and decided to borrow it for a quick read.It delivered a quick read I had chewed through it in a couple of days.Having not had the opportunity to read the previous homecoming books was no impediment to my understanding and enjoyment of this story.I liked revisiting old Voyager characters and meeting new ones, but my beef with the book is that it didn't come to a very satisfactory conclusion.I was about 12 pages out from the end when I realized that there were too few pages for the book to reach the climax that it took way too long building up to.I don't like cliff hanger endings and this book ended on one which, whilst it made me keen to return to my library in search of book two also pissed this aspiring novelist right off as having broken one of the cardinal rules of writing ie ""finish what you started!""A good one to slip in your suitcase for a weekend away, otherwise."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"Not only does this product NOT WORK, but when I called the number to cancel the order after the 14 days, I was told that it was 14 days fromt he day I placed the order, not received it. I only had it for a week!!! They charged my credit card for $88 and refused to let me speak to a supervisor, told me they ""were in a meeting"" - are you kidding me? DO NOT BY ANY PRODUCTS BY NATURE CLEANSE!!!!"
1,TIPS OVER,"IMPORTANT UPDATE - This stroller tips over on the slightest uneven ground. We were walking in the park one morning, and started down a paved path with a slight hill and the stroller did a nose dive with her strapped in. With the 70 lbs weight of the stroller on her she suffered a minor head contusion and a day spent in the ER for observations. Thank goodness she was not more severely injured. Buyer Beware!I bought this stroller to be different from the Bugaboo crowd in NYC. I loved the look of it &#150; stylish, sturdy, durable, different... But this thing is a giant. It weights a ton and is not easy to travel with. We have an Outback and it barely folds down enough to fit in the back.If you live in an apartment or house with stairs (we have 3 steps up to our front door) it is too big and heavy to carry with one person, so be warned. My baby is 7 months now and I am heading out to buy a Maclaren Stroller."
3,A great source of info,"As the other reviewers have said, this book does not explain everything about database design. Databases can be so extremly complex, could any book tell you all you'd need to know? This is a great place to start and Mere Mortals will teach you a mountain of details. If you are completely clueless, start with the Absolute Beginner's Guide. If you know a thing or two, this book will be a valuable addition to your collection.Overall, this is a very high quality volume. If you are into relationships, pick one up. Recommended."
5,Two thumbs up for Database Design for Mere Mortals!,"I found this book to be an absolute must-read for the beginning database designer. The author shared the fundamentals of database design in this logical, 1-2-3 step handbook. I've had a lot of experience in how not to implement a database. This is exactly what I needed! I like the way Mr. Hernandez lays the foundation and builds upon it throughout, sharing the how's and the why's. It may be too basic for someone who's had experience designing, but it's a great buy for the beginner!"
3,Good information hidden in too many pages,"There is plenty to be learned here. The emphasis is on a good database design methodology, which is good. However, the author extends numerous sections of this book beyond what was necessary. I've read different books on database design and in my opinion, this is not a great one. Still, the specific examples in the design process may prove useful for beginners."
3,Great For Starters!!!,"I read this book several months ago and found it to be a great introduction for someone who had moderate to no RDBMS experience. I felt it seemed to belabor certain issues and added a lot of non-technical ""fluff"" at times. {Perhaps it did reflect all too well some (quasi) 'real-world' corporate scenarios.) Now, with a bit more DB experience, I am ready for a more ""how-to"" technical guide. But I will probably still be referring to this book from time to time."
3,Good for Non-Technical People,"The author's approach to database design is of great use to someone who has a very weak technical background but a little too simplistic for my taste. There are a disproportionately large number of pages dedicated to hypothetical interviewing of users and management. In all fairness though, I did learn something so it was not a complete waste of money. My suggestion for technically adept individuals is to borrow this book for a quick intro and then proceed to buy a more rigorous book on the subject."
3,"too sparse, but good for a beginner","this was my first plunge into readings on database design. and even w/out any real training or anything i thought too much of what was covered in laborious detail was just common sense... but sometimes those things do need to be covered just so you have something more concrete to go by. there were about 3 good chapters in the book that i thought helped me a reasonable amount. but if you are already a programmer or have worked w/ databases i would recommend looking for another more advanced book, that's what i'm doing now."
1,For novices only,"Alot of fluff in this book. The first 100 pages could be condensed into about 25. Alot of time is spent explaining how to do user and management interviews. The interview stuff goes on and on, and on! I reccommend finding something else!"
1,This book was written for small children,"Simply put this book assumes its reader is a complete and total idiot. 80% of the book is just filler...overexplaining almost every tiny detail to the point of absurdity. So much wasted paper is spent on interview techniques and field names which is all common sense. If you have any common sense, spend your money elsewhere."
3,So-so. Hasn't anyone done a better job?,"This book is redundant and verbose to the point ofabsurdity. I teach Access and would neverrecommend this to my students.I could give you the ""beef"" in this book in about4 hours flat, and that includes learningto push the buttons!Also lots of sloppy editing. On p.103 we havea 12-year-old college graduate.????"
4,Excellent book - esp if you're new to Db's,"Being new to database design, I was looking for a book that would help me figure out the approach and methods to designing a database. This book is easy to read, good examples, and builds your understanding quite nicely. I recommend this (especially) to anyone who's learning database design. Although I suspect this would be valuable to more experienced database folks as well. I agree with others that more SQL examples would've been helpful."
4,"For Mortals, It Is Practically Valuable","A very nice book, which makes the daunting task of designing databases easy for ""mortals"". I like the facts that 1) the book is well written and easy to follow, 2) examples are plenty and to-the-point, 3) checklists or numbered procedures are handy for dealing with real problems.But for ""immortals"" (or smarties, or professionals) who earn a living on designing databases, this book may be too simple. First, the book is not concise and may be distilled into half less without losing any essential concept. Second, serious stuff like normal forms may be added. Third, maybe an expanded chapter on special situations like analysis- or performance-centered design. But this will change the title of the book, which is not what the author intends to do, I guess."
3,"It was decent, but...","While a lot of the design concepts are well-handled, if you're a programmer or developer who needs to quickly understand database design, this book can be maddening! It gets very frustrating to read through irrelevant or rambling content. The author JUST NEEDS TO GET TO THE POINT!!! When you need to get something running in a very short period of time, you need concise content."
2,there are better books out there,"This book is adequate but not great as an introduction to designing databases. I agree with other reviewers that it's quite repetitive and goes to extremes on details like field specifications. I suppose if you know nothing about DB design this book is OK - but you'll need other books and lots of practice designing your own databases if you truly want to become proficient. A much better general intro book to databases and simple design is 'Inside Relational Databases' by Whitehorn & Marklyn. Novices should look at 'Absolute Beginner's Guide to Databases' by John V. Petersen first.Once you've mastered those 2 books then get the best available book on DB design/modeling: 'Case*Method: Entity Relationship Modelling' by Richard Barker. It's excellent.Two other options for university level/advanced modeling: 'Database Modeling & Design' by Toby J. Teorey and 'Data Modeling Essentials: Analysis, Design, and Innovation' by Graeme C. Simsion"
4,This is required reading for novice developers.,"The title conveys well the usefulness of this book.After wading through a dozen books on the theoretical aspects of relational database design, I was looking for a good introductory text on the actual practice of building tables. I found this book an excellent primer.I have made this book required reading at our company for novice database developers. It's a quick read and removes the fear of atttempting database development. It's an a - z approach, so coupled with one of the common ACCESS references, the book provides all that is needed for single-handed developement of a simple relational database project."
1,Database Design for Mere First Graders,"This book does a good job of explaining how a relational database works but has its downfalls. One of the most important topics, Entity Relationship Diagrams, is almost entirely left out. ERD's are not technical nor hard to understand for the mere mortal. I purchased the book with the intention of brushing up on rusty DB skills. When I completed the book (after skimming) it seemed I didn't learn anything new. When completed with this book you will not be equipped with the basic skills to build a sound database. You will understand the principles of a sound database but you will not be equipped with the tools to build one. I want my money back."
5,"A logical, plain-English approach to database design","This book methodically outlines the process of designing an efficient, scalable database. The fundamental premise of this book is that HOW YOU STRUCTURE YOUR DATA affects the performance of your database more than any ""techie"" aspects i.e. software, hardware, etc. As a result, this book does not confront the reader with computer terminology or techno-jargon. Rather, it uses plain English to fine-tune the strategy and mindset of a database designer."
2,"Too lightweight, try other more substantial books","Like many people, I bought this book based on many readers' rave reviews. Unfortunately, it does not live up to its hype. While it has some useful information, they are few and far between. Too often, the author repeat the same point over and over and over...without shedding any new light.If you want a database design book that has information you can use (like normalization, supertypes and subtypes, etc.), you won't find it in this book. Instead, I recommend two other books: ""Data Modeling Essentials"" by Graeme C. Simsion and ""Database Modeling & Design : The Fundamental Principles"" by Toby J. Teorey"
2,Wasn't Terribly Helpful,"Too much background and emphasis on interviews and talking to everyone in the company before explaing how to put together a logical database. The first half of the book elaborates on the importance of preparation and that we'll get to designing and joining tables and establishing relationships later. When it finally comes, it's not very thorough. Too much on preparing and not enough on designing and building databases."
2,This is not technical book,"I am dissapointed with this book. The first half of this book is explaining how to make an interview with your client, and then use the interview data to design the database tables. It explains too much everyone-knows-it stuff, like a table's name must reflect it's contents, etc.The useful part of this book maybe is only one or two chapters. The explanation about table relationship is not so bad, eventhough it is a bit overexplained."
3,"Decent primer. For everyone else, move on.","This book favors a common-sense approach to database design, a methodology I read this book to avoid. The book is much better suited as a primer and reference of database terms. I was looking for a more rigorous and structured design methodology than his form-ridden ""feel-it-out"" approach he pushes. For those with more than three weeks worth of working around databases, I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,An Excellent Handbook Written By An Excellent Writer,"Michael J. Hernandez takes known, accepted database analysis and design methodology and turns it into step-by step techniques to design and develop a good relational database. Mr. Hernandez writes in a manner that any developer, regardless of his/her background or experience, can read and understand. The techniques are written for desktop environment, but can be applied to larger database systems as well. The book is easy to read without being simplistic, and is application non-specific. I heartily recommend it."
5,This Book Can Make You Money,"Well done. Michael Hernandez takes you through data base design setp-by-step in the most logical manner possible.If you have just a basic understanding of relational database design, by using the processes in this book, you can consult and design databases."
4,For beginners only!,"I don't know why other people thought this book was so revolutionary. It is a fine introduction to fields, tables and relations including basic diagramming but it is written in a tiresome way for someone who already knows the basics - It devotes a lot of ink to fake dialogs between the database developer and users. ""You: ..oh so you really only provide the actual information for two data items on this form...who provides the other information? User: Well, that would be Billy down the hall.."" etc"
1,Bad . . . just bad.,"This book is not good. Where it could just give you concepts and syntax and an explanation of database structure, it goes on long-winded life lessons about how to interview people and other non-technical stuff. Maybe I am just partial to technical references over process books, but there is almost nothing of technical value in here. Written by a Microsoft guy, it continues the Microsoft tradition of hiding the computer from you instead of just teaching you how the computer works. It's like trying to teach someone tennis but not letting them know they have a racket in their hand. It describes how to swing in laborious detail, when it would simply be better to show you what you've got in your hand."
3,"Decent, but tiresome execution","There is a lot of interesting info in this book, and MJH's approach to RDBMS is very user-friendly. For the beginner, this is an excellent guide. For anyone who wants to move beyond basics, it comes up short after a while, and gets bogged down with unnecessary details of the ""how-to"" of conducting a design interview.While I appreciate the importance of thorough preparation of a new database, MJH not only wants us to dot our i's and cross our t's he takes it to an extreme that is just not realistic (or, IMHO, necessary) for your average system. Cranking our spec sheets for every single column in every single table with check boxes for character types etc. is overkill."
4,One of the best database design books out there!,"This is one of the best database books I own. The author does a good job of explaining the basics and he guides you through the entire design process. Some chapters may be wordy for some people, but the author is trying to target everyone from novice to advanced user so this isn't surprising.I have been a database user for years and already understood many database concepts, but this book fills in the gaps of what I didn't know. I recommend this book for anyone who needs to design or support database applications. It's a great book!"
5,Ignore the Soreheads -- A Great Book,"No, this is not the book for you if you have extensive experience in software design and have already absorbed the basic concepts of database design by osmosis.This is a book for ""mere mortals,"" just like it says. I'm a reasonably smart, reasonably well-educated person who had some computer experience, but didn't even really know what a relational database was. Through circumstances too odd to mention, I was given primary responsibility for designing a commercial web application.I read this book cover to cover, and designed the database that became the core of the product. The product actually works, and seems to be selling. Later in the development cycle, I worked with a brilliant MIT-trained software engineer, and he found my basic db design just ducky.I definitely owe Mr. Hernandez a beer. Figured writing this review was a reasonable substitute."
4,Very good database design book for beginners,"When I first read this book, I was a rank amateur, and this book helped me immensely. It definitely prevented me from making some major mistakes. It describes, in a very methodical manner, the characteristerics of a good database design, and then gives examples. Excellent reading for the beginner!!!"
2,Ok but as one of several in your library,"GOod book for a intro course on Db.But insufficent for both intro and experienced..However, my only real grip, is that the cd incuded is documentation...but no actual value.In my last course using this book (Btw I am a 20 yr vet on databases, but relearning new ways of db using rails/etc..But the bummer is the diagramming and etc the author uses have yet to be found.Im using the same stencils and etc that Ive used for years .. and having to creat the same stuff the book has.Yes he has it, but in pdf form... which is virutally useless, because most will have to spend a unusual amt of time recreating what the book should have already had.No biggie, I use VISIO and other modeling tools heavily, but will either have to create a legend to say this is crows foot stuff or create the actully stuff direclty.Its ok enough book to keep, but would not have been my main choice to teach from."
2,Too Basic.,"If you have ever attended a course of Relational Database Design in school, you would want to look somewhere else, its too basic. I myself was looking at refereshing my RDBMS concepts but found the book lacking in depth. This book probably is good for people who just looked up the word ""Database"" in the dictionary."
4,A Very Good Introduction!,I am new to this area of data modeling and database design. After reading this book I feel it gave me a good foundation for success. Can anyone out there email me their opinion on the five best software packages for data modeling and database design and give me their opinions on their favorite? Thanks!Michael Bertonimichael_bertoni@yahoo.com
1,not a professional book,This is not for someone who really wants to lear database design. You don't know what you will get and how good is your design if you follow these ambigious guidelines.Ask any database designer if you can do it without knowing normalization or normal forms.
3,Not quite there,"The book does a fair job at explaining basic concepts about database design by keeping the english simple. However, it fails to lay a proper foundation for a number of key topics. It is poorly organizated and can not by itself take a novice to a clear understanding of database design.It appears the book is targeted at designing small MS Access databases. The author fails to develop the concepts of multiple relationships between tables. He also provides a narrow definition of first normal form that violates first normal form and neglects any discussion of Domain Key Normal Form (DKNF).While the author deserves kuddos for presenting recursion, he fails to do so smoothly or in a single location in the book. Ultimately, a reader may wonder why use recursion because the book clearly doesn't tell them."
4,favorite socks,Good quality and very durable. Fits well. Easiest way to shop as long as they fit you what you want in your size without going to the mall. Priceless
2,Poor Socks,"The socks are soft, but fit loosely on my foot, not snug. They are thin and after a few hours no longer provide absorption. Instead, they seem to get looser and often get creased under my feet.I ordered 24 pairs. About 3 socks came damaged when I opened the packages. I also don't like that the paper that holds them together leaves glue behind."
4,Husband loves them,I got these for my husband for his birthday and he liked them so much he asked for more. The are soft and durable and have more cushion on the bottom then other socks do. He is on his feet all day and says that these do make a difference.
1,"EASY WIPE ,NOT SO EASY","THIS EASY WIPE IS A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND IT CAN NOT BE REFUNDED!IT DOESN'T HOLD TOILET PAPER AT ALL,AND HARD TO MANEUVER,DO NOT BUY!!"
1,"Doesn't work, gathering dust","My suggestion would be to save up and install a bidet. Unless you want to put on some latex gloves every time you need to go #2. The TP does not release from the product, you have to pull it off. It does not clean your bottom unless you go threw a time consuming process of wrapping, wiping, and pulling off the TP (yuck)again and again. The button does not release the used tissue. Poorly designed products like these only serve to frustrate and humiliate. Not even close to being worth the money. If it were $10 I still would not buy it. If you use it (of course) it can not be returned. The only possible way I could see this product useful would be for a female unable to bend or reach who needs to cleanse after #1."
3,Ok,Thought the book would be bigger but i guess you cant really see that when you buy it. Have to read it to find out if its any good
5,It gets even better.,"An excellent second book in the ""Serenity"" series!Be aware that there are serious issues in this book that deal with addiction. This isn't just a fluffy comic, but one that deals with real issues and problems that need to be addressed with tweens/teens.Yes, the coloring is beautiful, yes there are some great jokes, but at the same time it does follow a storyline about drug and alcohol abuse. It's a serious topic that when written in this manner can be used as a discussion tool.Additionally, it stresses the concept of personal responsibility- --but with a few laughs along the way.Great book, it just keeps getting better!"
1,"Great idea, fatally flawed by unacceptably poor reception","I thought I had found the radio time-shifting product I have wanted for years. The design is great, the software is easy to use, the interface to iTunes is excellent, but without decent reception it all for naught. I have a number of inexpensive radios (clock radios, ""walkman"" types, table radios, etc.) in my home. All of them, except the RadioShark get good reception from a number of local stations.Unfortunately, my RadioShark is plagued by horrid interference that seems to be coming via the apparently unshielded USB cable. There is no facility for an external antenna. Supposedly, you can orient the RadioShark to get acceptable reception. I have not been sucessful. Once or twice I thought I had been successful in getting decent reception. However, when I subsequently listened to the recording, it was intermittenly unlistenable. Very disappointing.."
2,Poor AM reception makes this mostly useless except for NPR,"I bought this hoping to record talk radio shows from AM radio. Big disappointment, as has been stated by others. If you want to record music, get something like Stream Ripper for Mac OS X and grab songs from streaming radio stations. That way, the song name and author, etc., is saved with the song. Radio Shark is not a good tool for that. And due to poor AM, it obviously doesn't help much for AM talk show junkies like me. I will use it just to record NPR (national public radio on FM radio), as its FM is passable. Its interface is very nice.Documentation is pretty poor. There is a jack on the Radio Shark but the docs don't say what it is for. I hoped it was for an external antenna, but attaching an AM antenna to it did not good. The docs also said nothing about suggestions for improving AM receptino. I would just stay away from this for now, unless recording NPR is worth $65 to you. :-)"
2,A promise that doesn't quite deliver.,"The Good:* Solid construction and tasteful design.* A very fast, responsive tuner.The Bad:* Terrible reception. I could only get six FM stations to come in clearly, and only ONE AM station came in at all, and only then with significant static. The device has a jack for an additional external antenna, but one isn't included and it's not at all clear who (if anybody) sells such an add-on.* Hit-and-miss software interface design. The controls aren't as intuitive/user-friendly as they should be.This product works. Sort of. If you only care about being able to pick up STRONG local FM stations, maybe the $50+ is worth it. If you enjoy AM, you may not be happy at all with this device."
2,Reception was terrrible,"I like the product, like the software, but the reception was terrible.If you could ""really"" connect an external antenna, this would be a great item.But you can't so it isn't."
3,RaidoShark Radio actually works.....sort of.,"I bought this to record AM radio talk shows while I was at work and transfer them to my mp3 player. Well....AM does not record that well on this device, although my location is probably one of the reasons. I do record FM and can convert the recordings to mp3 format for payback. The sound quality is really great so for FM, the quality is superior. I wish there was someway to attach an antenna to the RadioShark to improve the reception. I rated this a 3, but if you are only interested in FM, I would rate it a 5. If you only want AM...a 1."
4,Just what I expected,"I was pleased that I did not experience any of the issues regarding reception. I live in a remote area and get very little in the way of radio as it. The shark picks up everything that my stereo does without any issue.Minor complaints are that the mute option is not button/toggle on the GUI, but instead a menu item. There's also is no ""power"" button. I kind of expected one to allow me to listen to my iTunes, yet schedule recordings with the shark. I guess mute would have the same result. I also had a problem with scheduling recording at 12:00 pm in 12hr mode. I changed my prefs to 24hr and that fixed it. I noticed there's an update available - maybe this is fixed in the update."
4,Perfect for recording Howard Stern,"I really enjoy listening to Howard Stern. Radio Shark allows me to record his show and fast-forward past the 20+ minutes of commercials he has every hour or so.It's very easy to install and use.After you purchase/install Radio Shark, make sure to upgrade the software on Griffin's (the manufacturer) web site."
1,Poor radio reception ruins otherwise good product,"As other users have mentioned, I also found that the radio reception from my RadioShark is very poor. In fact, it is completely unusable anywhere in my house, even on stations for which I can get a good signal from any cheap FM radio. Even using the USB extension and placing it by a window does not make it good enough. I also tried attaching my rooftop FM antenna to the headphone jack as suggested on the Griffin web site, but it made no difference. That antenna provides excellent signal on any other radio. I guess I have a nice USB-powered night light.Too bad, since I have several other Griffin products, and have always been satisfied in the past. Next time, I will read the reviews first."
1,Poor Reception,POOR RECEPTIONI've never owned a radio with reception this poor.I'm using Radio Shark on Mac Mini with version 2 beta software. I live in a major market with dozens of radio stations. Only one comes in clearly. I've tried plugging many cords into antenna jack. I've tried USB extension cables to change the location of shark.It does record on a schedule. ACC Recordings land in iTunes and transfer to iPod without human intervention. Unfortunately the software can't record MP3 format. There are several utilities available to transcode the recordings to MP3.My next step is to crack the case and solder on a real antenna jack. Hopefully a real antenna in my attic will help.
1,"Looks cool, works NOT",This is such a great idea but it does not deliver. It all comes down to reception which is terrible even in ideal locations with strong signal strength.
2,I was dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with the product. It's usability is really poor, required lots of work just to get it to play radio. The inclosed manual leaflet was not very helpful, I had to search the answers from the net. And still I haven't been able to get any recordings done, pressing the REC button just doesn't seem to make anything happen. I don't succeed to record live radio, not to talk about scheduling the recordings beforehands, which was the reason why I bought it in the first place.Additionally, if you think you can use it for recording net radios or pod casts, forget it. The recordings can be done only from from AM/FM radio programs (well, I haven't been able to do even that yet)."
1,"Bad reception, bad software, bad packaging","AM reception was very poor. The antenna is very directional and you'll have to reposition it between stations. For certain orientations the signal disappears completely. For one station, the only workable position was upside-down (the base is not movable, so you end up trying to wedge the tip into place somehow).The Mac software appears to be CPU-needy. If you're doing something else at the same time you'll get stutters in your audio.The clamshell packaging is of course annoying and easy to hurt yourself on trying to open.-----update-----Additionally, after scheduling an ""hourly"" recording, it only recorded the first hour. Even though the interface indicated it was still recording, no new files got generated."
1,Disappointed,"Got this thing for my mobile clinic and it cannot even get the local 50,000 watt AM station (static). It cannot receive FM transmitter from XM radio 7 feet away without major static.Okay- so I brought it in the house- two different rooms where I have radios and OS X macs- the 50000 watt station was barely audible. Who would want to record?I too would like to know what the jack in back is for because it needs an antenna. Another waste of money.Oh- the software seems okay but it is moot when you can't get a decent signal."
3,Mac G5 users - wait a little bit,"I'm very pleased with the way RadioShark works - when it works. Sounds great and the software works fine.But... There's a glitch with G5-based Mac computers which means that the software freaks out if the computer sleeps (even the monitor). After it sleeps, RadioShark only makes a chattering noise that sounds like a skipping CD. Restarting the app doesn't help, and unplugging RadioShark just crashes the computer. You have to restart your Mac to get RadioShark working again. Griffin says the workaround is not to let your Mac or its monitor sleep at all - not a valid fix in my opinion.Apparently Griffin is working on a software fix. If you have any kind of G5 Mac, I'd wait until they get it figured out before you plunk down for this. Keep checking their website [...] to see when they post the G5 fix."
2,Poor AM performance,"If you want to record AM stations, avoid this. I had unsatisfactory AM reception, even after attaching a simple AM loop antenna to the mini plug connector via a 300 ohm to miniplug adapter."
1,Very poor Windows XP support,"The shark fin looks great on my window sill. The radio reception is just OK. The Windows XP version of the RadioShark app is horrible. The manual is full of really cool features. Read a bit more and you find these only work on the MAC. On the MAC recordings can be automatically saved to iTunes. Not on a PC. On the MAC there is a little clock that tells you where you are in the time shifted recording. On the PC there is an impossible to use slider. Want to back up five minutes? LOL. On the MAC there is ""scrubbing"" so you can here and you move through the recording. Not on the PC. The MAC has a fancy new 2.0 version of the RadioShark app. The PC has a very buggy version 1.1.7. Enough said."
2,Not ready for prime time :-(,"I wanted to like this product, and I certainly like the concept a lot, as an avid radio listener. It works pretty well with very strong stations, but the reception is pretty awful on anything else. Their website says to try connecting an antenna to the headphone jack, but I tried connecting to all 3 terminals of the jack (L, R, GND) and none of them made any diference. I have radios that exhibit excellent reception in my area (Philips, Sony), so in 2005 it's hard to understand why Griffin can't get this right.The software seems to crash in Win XP occasionally (on my system, at least), but when it doesn't crash, it's easy to use.Griffin makes some nice product, but unfortunately this ain't one. I would wait for ""Radio Shark II"", should that arive, before buying. I'm going to sell mine."
4,"Great, but some caveats for PC users","I love my RadioShark, but note that it's a little ""clunkier"" for Windows users than it is for Mac users. The main thing you don't get, but I wish I did, is integrated support for ITunes. Currently, I have to go to ITunes, import RadioShark files, which requires ITunes conversion into a different format.And the Windows version of the RadioShark software is functional, but has a pretty awful, non-intuitive interface that doesn't follow the norms one expects of Windows applications. But on the other hand, there are none of the ""sleep"" issues Mac users describe with scheduled recordings.Highly recommended still, but not quite as seamless and user-friendly a product for Windows users as for Mac people."
2,Software Disappointing on the Mac,I have had no problems with reception in the Oakland CA area but I am very disappointed in the software that is provided (even the new v2.0.1). First - It is not as elegant as other best of category Mac software like Unison; Acquisition; or Delicious Monster. 2nd - the whole method of seting up shortcuts is poorly implemented. 3rd - it does not work with the User Switching mode in OSX meaning anytime you actively switch users on the computer the applicaton records dead air.
3,Would be excellent if not for light background popping noise,"Would be excellent if not for light background popping noise. This noise appears to be a software problem as no popping is detected when its FM/AM hardware is used with similar audio recieve software. Sent this back, but would have easily kept it had there been no light popping in the audio's background."
4,"Works great, but software could use some upgrades","I think this thing is really cool, and I love it. However, the software interface could be better. Instead of buttons for the radio stations, there's a pop-up menu list. Buttons to mimick a read radio would be much better. The recording and othe ""Tivo""-like features could also use a better UI. Regardless, I really like it."
4,improving,"v.2 of the software running with OS X tiger runs much better, without the freezes and failure to sleep etc. that plagued earlier versions. I plugged an old pair of headphones into the antenna jack and now get better reception & more stations than on my stereo, which has a 6' t-shaped wire antenna.I got this free for pledging on my local NPR station, and I'm not sure I would have paid the full price..."
1,Behaves Like a Prototype,"I've had huge problems getting this thing to actually record a useable file. It apparently saves 5 files as it records, then combines them into the final AAC file. Unfortunately, mine usually leaves the 5 files (3 .mov files and 2 .m4a files) unfinished and uncombined, but NONE of these files can be played by anything -- they all return errors.Of course, this is just one of several issues with this device. The software is crude and limited, the manual nearly useless (""troubleshooting"" amounts to little more than the equivalent of ""did you turn it on?"") and there is no supplemental troubleshooting material on the Griffin website. The tuner sensitivity is poor -- I get better reception from a crappy boombox and a $5 flashlight/radio! In fact, I often get crosstalk from other stations.Frankly, this thing stinks. I consider myself burned and probably won't ever buy Griffin products again."
1,Awful Reception,"In comparison with radios located at the identical spot in my house, this radio gets truly awful AM reception. The manufacturer sells an extra antenna, but the reviews are not good. My Radioshark was non-returnable. So I threw it away as useless. Avoid this product, of course, and if this one is so bad, probably any others by this company. (Note: I bought it for recording sports on AM; I did not have a reason to try the FM. But generally FM antennas need to be bigger than AM, and the AM doesn't work, so...)"
1,Very week reception,"Unfortunately Radio Shark has problems picking up only but the strongest signals. They do not provide hookup for external antenna either that could improve some station reception slightly. Even in the open, it picks up very few stations. The interface needs some work as well."
1,Absolutely Worthless Piece of Junk,Sound quality from AM that is so tinny it hurts your ears and a buggy interface that causes crashes and features that don't do what they are supposed to.And don't let the idea that a simple software/driver update will fix the problems;The latest software version available from the manufacturer's website is actually WORSE and has had some features REMOVED.STEER CLEAR!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB GETTING IT TO ME!GRIFFIN PRODUCTS AND THE COMPANY LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED. I CALLED AND LEFT AN E-MAIL AND THEY GOT BACK TO ME BY E-MAIL THREE DAYS LATER. I CALLED THEM BACK ABOUT THEIR DEVICE AND THEY SAID IT WAS A DRIVER PROBLEM AND TO DOWN LOAD THE NEW DRIVER AN IT WOULD FIX IT.IT DID NOT. I CALLED BACK AND THEY SAID WELL IT MUST BE BROKEN WE WILL SEND YOU ANOTHER ONE AFTER YOU SEND US BACK THE DEFECTIVE ONE. THEY STATED IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 3-4 WEEKS. THEIR TURN AROUND TIME AND SERVICE STINK!!!
3,"Problematic, though eventually decent.",Does not work that well with the drivers that comes with it. Lots of background hum and other audio distortions. It works mildly better with the updated drivers on griffin's website. Works pretty well if you download the drivers for the RadioShark 2. Pretty expensive original price though.
2,Great concept.......poor software and reception,I bought this to record lectures that were broadcast over an in-house fm signal. I've done this before with a portable mp3 recorder and had fine results but thought I could set this up to do it automatically and have the files saved on my computer. I was disappointed that the recordings I made with the radioshark had static in them so the reception must be very weak. Also the software left alot to be desired. I ended up returning this product and went back to setting up my mp3 fm/recorder manually to do the job.
3,Good but not great,"Easy to set up and use but the reception is weak by design. The antenna (Shark Fin) is not the ideal shape for an antenna. I knew that but bought it on clearance and gave it a shot. It works and I'll keep it, but I was hoping for more.The product has been dropped from Griffin, according to their website, but the latest software is still available and will be needed if you encounter problems with the EQ settings, such as getting access to them.Nice idea but it stops there. I get about a third of the stations I could get over a standard AC or battery powered radio. The plus side is that you can time shift or record anything you want from the few remaining stations that it does pick up.There is a RS2 available now that included Internet radio at no charge. Unless they have improved the reception it may be no better than the original shark. Perhaps it is the allure of the Internet radio that will bring in more buyers."
1,Makes a pretty paper weight,"I really wanted to like this product. It was a great concept. TIVO for radio... that's all I want. Unfortunately the engineers at Griffin probably all came from design school and know nothing about radio circuitry. I live in a high-rise in the city and usually get great reception. This unit has no isolation from the computer and just picks up CPU noise. I tried two different computers. The PC software is extremely buggy, freezes often, and actually crashed my computer once. The manual is written in such a relaxed style that it reminded me of an annoying store clerk who tries to use humor to compensate for their lack of knowledge. I am returning mine and will be trying out POGO radio instead."
1,Disappointing Radio Reception,"As with other people's reviews, this is a great idea. Unfortunately I can't use a great idea if it can't pick up the radio station I listen to. All other radios in the house can, and Griffin's advice of plugging in headphones to act as an improved antenna only helped slightly. Also had a few minor software problems. All in all, disappointing and will be returned to Amazon."
2,radioSHARK,"The radioSHARK looks great, but its program was designed by middle schoolers. There are so many little things to piss you off when you use it - not just that it crashes, but that it really looks like they never finished it, and were just looking to throw something together in a few hours to test out the reception (which is OK, but certainly not great).The Mac version of the software is at least tolerable, but even it will only record files in AIFF and AAC. The Windows version has WAV, MP3 and WMA, so it's not as though they didn't want to pay Fraunhofer to include MP3 support - it's apparent that they just didn't feel like doing it."
1,Radio Shark is TERRIBLE,"I bought this product a bit ago, and was surprised on how poorly it performed. I hooked it up to my computer, and it only got 1 radio station!!! The radio shark itself is one of the worst receptors I have ever had any experiance with. I have a crappy little alarm clock close to my computer(with no antenna), and it picks up like 15 or 16 stations. So unless you live very close to your most favorite radio station's tower outpost, I would not recommend this product for anyone. You will be very displeased that you wasted all that money...I guarantee it!"
4,Quite decent but with some negatives,"The main negative is that the radio reception, both AM and FM, is problematical. One can utilize an FM antenna - there is a space for one - but nothing can be done for AM. You can orient the device in various directions but while that improves the reception it remains less than stellar. The software is good, generally speaking, and if the reception was equal to it, it would be a very fine device. Out of the box it is only fairly good."
2,Good idea poorly executed,"Like most of the other reviewers, I give this tuner very poor marks for reception. Even the strongest FM stations are a bit noisy and otherwise strong AM stations are all but unlistenable. The software interface is nice, as is the hardware. But it's basically worthless for its core function: radio reception. The EQ function flat does not work. As soon as you enable it, the audio gets garbled, even when using the ""flat"" preset. I only purchased this because of the easy return policy, which, unfortunatly, I'll be using."
5,I am SO THRILLED!,"I was a little leery about this product after reading all of the negative comments about reception.Installation was a snap. Plugged it in, and it worked PERFECTLY! OK...ok... so the AM is a little ""buzzy"". But as a talk radio fan, this slight aural annoyance is minor.The timed recording function works perfectly!I used to miss my favorite radio program because it ran too early in the morning. I could download podcasts of the program for over $50 per year. But with the RadioShark I record the live broadcast free. In less that one year, the RadioShark will have paid for itself!I like this product so much that I'm giving one to my dad for Christmas."
4,RadioShark,"This product is well built and very easy to set up. It works great with strong radio stations, but does not pick up weak AM signals well with out an external antenna."
2,Use streaming. This is too little and too late,"AM function is worthless - cause it picks up computer (required) noise. Use caution with the replacement model.Clever, but a breakthrough in 2001, not 2007."
4,PROVIDES EXCELLENT SUN PROTECTION FOR EYES AND LOOKS NEAT TOO,"I am not a football aficionado so how correct the placement of the decals might be is much less important to me than how it fits and how well it keeps the sun out of my eyes. This hat does both jobs fairly well and it looks good too. I have a pretty big head [size 8-8.5] so hat fit is extra important. The small percentage of spandex in this hat really improves the fit. It also has something invisible that supports the front of the hat by stiffening it, which I think really helps it keep its shape through wear and washings.The price [$12.99] is a real bargain for a decent fitted hat, while the bright color and cool appearance only augment the hat's value. These hats seem to hold up pretty well over time too. I'm not sure whether the material is Scotchguarded, but the material doesn't stain and the color doesn't fade -- definite pluses in my book!"
1,cheap and almost useless,"I tried to save money, and made a bad decision buying this off-brand cartridge. It started out with a bang - loaded the same, looked the same, and then after 7 or 8 photos, the ink ran out and there went my money. Never again will I order this product!"
1,Do not buy,"The printer does not read the cartridges and once I went to take it out, it wouldn't budge. I ended up destroying the machine just to get the cartridge out, and I now have to throw out my $200 machine."
1,Buyer Beware,I tried it. It destroyed my printer. Even the factory couldn't salvage it. Don't buy it.
1,The Original is much better,"This song starts out well enough, but as usual nobody leaves well enough alone. About two-thirds of the way in, it breaks into guitar work reminiscent of Boston (YUCK), then gets into a bit of rap (DOUBLE YUCK), and finally concludes with a horrible grunge-style guitar jam that would make the dead man proud (TRIPLE YUCK)! It's as if they are trying to include three styles of music into one song. It fails miserably. Fortunately, the original 1984 version is included on the cd so the ""young'ens"" could see the differece between an original master-piece and this master piece of cr*p."
1,Where's The Original?,Does anyone know if the original has been remastered and is available on CD? The new one is worthless.
1,Most Horrible Song Ever!,"I heard this on the radio and was VERY disappointed. The first band aid ""Do They Know it's Christmas"" is a great song, the artists can actually sing and it sounds like a Christmas song. This new one does not sound like it was made by professional artists, the way it sounds was grueling, like nails on a chalkboard for 4 minutes. Sometimes remakes are not a good idea, keep to the classic version."
2,"Spare us Bob, spare us...","Now if you ask me, and many aging pop stars with a philanthropic bent do now and again, Midge Urea and Bob Gandalf should have just re-released the 1984 version and saved us all the earaches. It was a nice thought, but it sounds like they didn't arrange much studio time to pull this one off. It lacks 100% of the emotion of the first version and the added rapping segment is completely disrupting to the whole thing. The piano intro is nice and it's too bad the entire things wasn't just the piano being played and Paul Hewson belting out his trademark line from 1984.[...]"
5,Quality tune,"The old version was a classic, this one isn't quite as good but its still worth a listen. As for people moaning about the lack of Sir Paul. I heard an interview with Bob Geldof where he said that the only factor he looks at when including people is their ability to sell records. Due to the fact that the vast majority of those who buy singles are teenagers he went with young artists that appeal to that demographic. The Dizzee Rascal rap and the Darkness vocals/guitar are both quality additions. Those beyond their teens would by the record anyway either because they want to support charity or because they want to hear the original version.Buy this record regardless, it has something for everyone."
2,2 sizes smaller than size specified,"This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order. I ordered a size 9, but wasn't able to wear them. I gave them to my little brother who's a size 7, they fit him perfectly."
4,Uncensored- The way movies should be made.,"I just watched The Dictator and I did see Bruno. Cohen is hilarious. His movies are made the way movies should be made, real. How many movies have I seen where I have seen the same movie with different characters the is the same from start to finish with the typical everyone is happy ending? Boring!!! At least my interest is kept with these movies. If you are a boring and probably jesus fearing person Cohen's movies will scare you. But I find them awesome. I am a male and I am not afraid to see a penis in a movie, I look at mine quite a few times a day. Wake up America and stop being afraid!!!"
1,One of the worse movies I have ever seen,Saw this movie at the theaters. Some older people and people with children left the theater within the first five minutes of opening. It was disgusting and disturbing at the same time.The only reason I watched the entire movie was because I paid for the ticket and felt that I had to get at least some of my money's worth. You cannot pay me to watch this movie again.
2,will buy used,hey just wanted to add my 2 cents i rented this movie because i loved borat bruno however does have its funny moments it goes a little too far with the sexual humor i dont mind the sex bits but this movie has too many total overkill and it took away from the movie any who the scenes involving little oj are the most funny
1,"The movie was funny, but Amazon VOD wasn't loud enough to hear","This is the first movie I have rented from Amazon's Video on Demand and I was very disappointed because the volume of the movie wasn't loud enough to hear easily, despite the VOD and computer's volume being maxed. I don't plan on renting from them again, I will just go to red box... at least I know I will be able to hear the movie and it's cheaper!"
1,80 minutes of my life...LOST,"This movie was absolutely awful. As a HUGE fan of Borat, I was expecting a lot out of this movie, but this went way too far. What a complete waste of 80 minutes."
1,wouldent buy it,"personally i bought this movie before i saw it and i want my money back i loved borat that was a halarious movie but this i would strongly recomend renting, dont waste 20$ on it"
1,"Loved Borat, but this is the Worst Movie Ever!!!!",You will lose over an hour of your life on this crap. It's not worth it.
2,It's like a gay porno.,"I went to see this in theaters and I wished i didn't. The first 15 minutes of this movie I wanted to walk out of the theaters because it was distrubing as far as the main character (Bruno) having a very homosexual lifestyle, but I was with my brother at the time so I just endured it and stayed. Small parts of the movie were funny and pretty bad as far as being prejudice. Other than that it was pretty awful. I wouldn't watch it again. Comedy movies are just not funny anymore!"
1,"Can I give a ""minus star"" rating, please?","This is by far one of the WORST movies I ever tried to watch. I rented it - what a huge waste of $5. I couldn't even finish watching this piece of garbage, it was so incredibly stupid and just plain disgusting. I thought ""Borat"" was a riot - this was just AWFUL. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of garbage."
1,Waste of Time,"This movie is the biggest piece of crap and waste of my time. I only bought the stupid thing because my husband likes it. Sacha really needs to find something else to do. I can't believe that he has been able to fool so many people in the world with two different characters. And somebody paid him good money to do this. And he will definately go to some fiery inferno when he dies.You know now that I think about it, why am I even wasting my time writing a review for this? It was crap, put it that way and I would rather have somebody poke me in the eye with hot pokers than watch that or anything of the like again."
1,The most stupid movie I ever saw....,"I am no prude by any means so my review is not based on the sexual nature of the film. HOWEVER, if you even have the slightest ""homophobia"", this film isn't for you. AND PLEASE -NO KIDS! Very BORING movie and can't believe I sat through the entire thing. Guess I was waiting for it to get better? I love to laugh, and my husband as well, but just didn't get what was so funny???? In speaking with my friends and family, nobody I know was able to sit through it - just shut it off so I know we are not the only ones. Definitely not worth the time or money. What a waste of talent!!!"
5,Just as funny as Borat,"After watching the movie on Bluray, I came to the conclusion that this movie is just as funny as Borat, whereas, after I saw it in the theater, I thought it was good, but not as great as Borat. This is thanks in large part to the hilarious and thoughtful special features, it's a shame many of the deleted scenes were cut out. Of course, you must have an open mind and not be easily offended to enjoy this type of comedy, which requires a bit of intelligence in order to appreciate, unlike most other forms of humor these days."
2,znot all that funny,Sasha Baron Cohen is not as funny as he seems to think he is. I am not a prude but too much of the film is devoted to gross-out gags. I am offended by the time I wasted in watching this film.
1,Completely unfunny,"I had high hopes for a serious laugh-a-thon when I ordered this film...boy was I disappointed.I thoroughly enjoyed both the UK and HBO TV series of Ali-G as well as the Borat movie. Bruno on the otherhand, was tasteless and completely unfunny.I'd recommend that the reader of this review spend their money on Mr. Cohen's much funnier earlier works."
1,Bruno DVD,"Terrible terrible experience with Amazon. I bought this on Black Friday. Got a great deal, but they sent me a bad copy of the dvd. For starters, when I got the dvd it was rolling around loose inside of its case. When I tried to watch the dvd it skips allllllllllllll the way through the movie. I have seen the movie before at the theatre when it came out, so the movie is hilarious as far as that goes, just had a bad experience with Amazon on this one."
1,Hard to believe this movie saw the light of day,"If you enjoy racisim, stupidity, lots of male nudity, and no plot what so ever than this is the movie for you. Seriously I couldn't be more clear that this movie isn't worth even thinking about maybe watching. Please join the boycott against these types of movies, actors, and general decline in american entertainment"
1,OMG This movie was horrible!,"Ok, this moveie is chock full of sexual inuendos and absolutly disgusting scenes showing hairy nuts! I would not wish this movie to be watched by my worst enemy."
1,Clearly shows where America is going.,"If you were wondering what direction America is going, then take a look at this movie. This is the reason liberals should move to Canada."
1,ZERO STARS,"This is the very sort of ""entertainment"" our ailing world can do without, the DNA of what ails the present human condition."
1,trash movie,"i just watched this trashy flick,as i enjoyed watching him on ""borat"" .but,this is the most stupid and racist movie i ever watched.i will never patronize any of his flick anymore.i really regret buying it,even though i'm gay!"
4,Cohen's genius should be mandatory for all high school seniors,"Cohen shows the twisted disgusting reality that the homosexual activists hide from the public trying to convince normal people that the perversion of homosexuality is just an ""alternative choice."" Anyone who watches this must realize that the idea of allowing perverts to ""marry"" and live and engage in their perversion openly in our military is not only ridiculous, disgusting, and dangerous to civilized society, but is truly very sick. Cohen is a genius; and the movie is funnier than hell in a sick way."
1,The worst piece of Crap you could imagine!,"Don't waste your time and definitely don't waste any real money on this. It is not funny, no matter how you try. It would not be funny if you watched it again, pure rubbish plain and simple. Shocking not, just cheap! If you want a shocking movie that at least IS funny you should get ""Pink Flamingos"" by John Waters. You do need an open mind for that one."
1,1 star rating is 1 star too many,"I absolutely hated this movie! and I'm not one to be easily offended but there was just one too many toilet humor for it to be considered funny. I watched it hoping to get the same results as Borat, Bruno was nothing compared to that."
4,Bruno,I enjoyed the DVD very much. I thought it was very funnyI am of austrian desent. So I liked the hummer.But my wife did not like it at all. She could not stand it.
2,"Pretty awful movie, but had some HILARIOUS parts","As a whole, this was an absolutely terrible movie. However, with that said, a few parts of the movie were funnier than anything I've seen in a LONG time. One part in particular had me laughing so hard, I had to put it on pause and laugh it out for 5 minutes.About half of the movies/jokes didn't go over very well, and ended up being filler in the movie, even though that wasn't the intention. Unfortunately, with a film like this, part of the humor is the people's reaction to Bruno's antics.The shock value in this movie is through the roof. I've read other reviewers say it and I'll say it as well: Bruno isn't for the easily offended, or for kids. There's a tremendous amount of male nudity, and even some female nudity.There were a few bright spots, like I said before. Some extremely funny moments, but as a whole, the movie didn't deliver the goods. But if you want a few HARD laughs and not much of a movie itself, watch this film!"
4,"""A bear ate all of my clothes...""","The Bottom Line:Bruno isn't quite as funny as Borat but Cohen certainly gives it a try, mixing scripted sequences with 'Candid Camera"" style footage to showcase stage mothers at their worst, Paula Abdul as a ""humanitarian,"" and homophobia across the nation; I understand why people didn't like the film, but I found it fearless and very funny.3/4"
1,Boring,"Although this movie has gleaned some astonishingly favorable reviews here on Amazon, my opinion differs signficantly from the majority. In short, this is a boring and empty movie that tries to be funny through deploying bad taste to the extreme but ends up looking like something a 10-year-old might have thrown together. Whereas Borat was genuinely funny in many places, Bruno is just dull and flat and empty. Not worth the price of a rental - in fact, not really worth the time taken to read the title sequence."
1,This is ridiculous.,"Absolutely ridiculous. This movie is filled with a bevy of ""OMG!!!!"" moments, which could be putting it mildly. ATTENTION! ATTENTION! THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN. Therefore, please DO NOT allow your minor children to get their hands on this movie. Further, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH THEM ON FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT. Please don't. You will ALL be sorry."
1,Bruno,This movie is absolutely terrible. Unless you enjoy male frontal nudity this is not the movie for you.
1,"Can I make that a negative ""1"" star","What did I miss? Were others watching a different movie and I received the wrong DVD in the box? I was determined to watch the whole movie, as I was sure that something would change; the only thing that changed was my impression of the film went to worst. How did they trick so many stars to appear in this film that appears to be written and produced by some 13-year old boy."
3,Ok,"I thought it was going to be a lot more funny then that, but it was ok. I live in a small town so I don't get to go to the movies."
4,"Some rehashing of Borat, but just as hilarious and wacky","Borat and Bruno have much in common: they are foreign idiots who cannot comprehend the U.S., yet travel all over it in an attempt to get to know the people better and to become famous. Sacha Baron Cohen outdoes himself again as Bruno, the hapless, flamboyant Austrian who fails at fashion, then at acting, then in several other ways before cutting a hit single for charity with such stars as Bono, Elton John, Slash, and more. On the way to that, he learns a lot about American homophobia, gay conversion ministries, test audiences for TV pilots, the perils of interviewing celebrities, and more. The funniest bit involves O.J., an African baby that Bruno adopts, in a sense, after trading an iPod for him.This is not for those who are easily offended or those for whom satire is over their heads. Otherwise, rent it and laugh like crazy."
4,Borat was better,"I've always been a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen. I have all of his work (that I can find) on DVD, excluding the Ali G movie..which I thought was weak. Watching his old episodes of Ali G, Bruno is hilarious; in small doses Bruno alienating dude-man-bro frat kids and wearing a suit made of dongs is really funny. Watching a feature film of it isn't as spectacular. Like the title says, Borat was way better. If you're debating buying this, skip it, rent it, and buy his HBO series on DVD.Da Ali G Show - Da Compleet Seereez"
2,It's ok.,"It's kinda funny. Not nearly as much as Borat, just rate it as ok. Definitely not worth more than a $5 pay per view home watch."
2,Bruno,"I expected the movie to be funny and stupid because of the creator, but it proved to be a little too extreme for me. It was funny and unbelievable at the same time. I couldn't believe that people agreed to participate (knowingly or unknowingly). I didn't like this film that much."
3,"Politcally incorrect, perverse, and absurd.",This movie would make John Waters and Divine proud. Bruno is an extremely obnoxious and narcissistic gay man. He goes around annoying and offending people in a way that is similar to Borat. If you liked Borat and you are not homophobic then you should find Bruno hilarious.
2,So over the top that the top becomes a speckle far away,"Brüno is one of Sasha Baron Cohen's great characters and without doubt the most ""fabulous"".The film cannot escape being compared to Borat since both are based around an outlandish character and peoples reactions to it and the films are built up in a very similar manner, Brüno and his sidekick travel about and have a series of adventures.In parts the movie is very funny but too many times it goes way over the top. Certainly this is in the build up of Brüno's character but it stops being funny and becomes painful. Seeing how its best parts and cleverly paced humour can be so good it is hard to see such potential wasted.At the end it doesn't come close to Borat and the 18 classification is deserved.Possibly a watcher (not for the faint of heart nor if you object to homophobic humour) but not a keeper."
3,It's the Best of Films;It's the Worst of Films,"After ten minutes into ""Bruno"" I was almost ready to go for the remote. I was almost convinced I knew why people were leaving this film in droves when it was in theatres. What kept me from shutting it off was the memories of the brilliant ""Borat"" in my memory banks. Soldiering on the film got better, in part, with brilliant bits that challenge institutional homophobia in America. The worst parts were those designed for shock value without any artistic significance. So it's a definite mixed review from me. Sacha Baron Cohen says he's retired Borat. Rethink it Sacha and return to what you do best."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"It's Bruno! The latest character from Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen is of course known for Borat and being outrageous. He goes so far in this film, that he was actually arrested 3 times while filming it, Bruno however doesn't live up to Borat. Borat was one of those movies. that you can watch over and over again. and it was still funny, Bruno isn't like that. The first time around, it's pretty funny, even thou the constant gay jokes and references to anal and oral sex gets old, fast. When it came out on DVD and I watched it again, I wasn't as impressed by it. The third time, even less so. Bruno is raunchy and good for some laughs and shock value the first time you see it, but after that it loses everything. This is the kind of movie you should rent, but definitely not buy."
3,enough already,"Baron Cohen doing his grossout schtick over and over. See Borat once and you have it. Yes you can't help laughing sometimes, but this movie got on my nerves.. I think Baron Cohen is a genius and would like to see him conquer new and different fields from here on out."
3,Not what I thought,I bought this movie on the strength of Borat. I thought it would be like it but wasn't. It made me laugh a bit but I could do without this movie.
1,Piece of Junk,"While I have enjoyed some of his other material, this particular movie is a piece of junk. Could not continue after a little while."
4,"An extreme, gay Jackass.","That sums it up. It`s good, don`t get me wrong; I really enjoyed it, but it may be too much for some people. I have a really high tolerance for the extreme, and this came close to pushing my envelope. Worth watching, and made me want to try Borat. Hillarious, shocking, entertaining, eye-opening."
1,Just another assault...,"Just another assault, by the certain interests and groups in relentless, thousand years old quest, to kill moral, aesthetic, and ethical values of majority...Be stupid enough, and pay for it!"
1,Not that Great,"I had high hopes that this movie was going to be a riot. However, I was let down. This movie was not that great. It just didn't do it for me. I found it rather dull. I only laughed at a few parts. Not one to buy for sure. I don't even think it is worth a rental."
1,The WORST,What a total waste of money. Borat at least had humor. This movie is in such bad taste I have a hard time believing someone would even make it. I'm ashamed to say I wasted my money. I wish I had known before I bought it that it was disgusting with a total lack of entertainment value. Shame on me.
1,Glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I saw Borat once, and that was enough. Bruno is the same way. I don't ever have to see it again. I think this movie was more shock-value-driven than anything."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,"Save your money and your time. I get what he was trying to do, but I think all he managed to accomplish was to lower the bar for comedy."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"What an awful movie. Not funny, not witty, not clever, just bad taste. I liked Borat and was looking forward to Bruno. To say that I was disappointed is putting it mildly. It had potential - I liked the idea, but the movie was dreadful."
1,deserves zero stars or even a negative number,"Although Borat had its funny moments, Sacha Baron Cohen has create a new movie that is totally gross and disgusting, portrays gays in the absolute worst possible light, just bad, bad, bad. In his eyes all human beings are leg-humping dogs or worse - makes you want to embrace celibacy. The worst porno is more tasteful than this. Don't waste your time and/or money."
1,"sick, sick","You know if someone were to warn me tell me to, ""expect the worst"" I still would have been shocked with the stuff i seen in this movie. Ya there were parts in this movie that left me temp. blind and running to the restroom. ""Do Not"" waste your money"
2,"much, much worse than borat","I thought Borat was great, which gave us a look into some of the less talked about aspects of American culture: religious fanatics, the shallowness of some celebrities, etc. Bruno tries to tackle much of the same aspects but this time around ends up being merely annoying. The big difference is that Borat's character actually had at least SOME endearing aspects about him-he at least attempted to do good for his country. Bruno is basically self absorbed and is willing to do just about anything to get famous.My opinion: uninspired, forced, and not worth the time."
5,show trial thriller,"This thriller by Eric Ambler, a master of the form, is an exciting story with the Moscow style show trials as a backdrop. Foster, the narrator, finds himself in disconcerting circumstances outside those of his previous experience, not unlike those encountered by the legion of Hitchcock protagonists. The more Foster tries to grasp the elusive truth in a totalitarian regime, the closer he draws to danger and possible death. This book is a great ""spy genre"" companion to ""Darkness at Noon""."
3,SOUTHWESTERN STYLE BEAR WITH HEARTLINE,THE RING IN THE PICTURE IS THE RING THAT I ORDERED BUT IT IS NOT THE RING I RECEIVED. THE ONE IN THE PICTURE HAS A TURQUOISE BEAR ON IT WITH A SILVER HEARTLINE THROUGH IT. THE ONE I RECEIVED HAS AN INSET BEAR WTIH BLACK BACKGROUND AND A BEAR PAW ON IT.
3,not quite the best of bounty killer,"This album is must have for new bounty fans. However longtime bounty fans already have all of these tracks if they have bought his albums in the past. I would rate the album as only being decent. Some of the tracks on the album I don't feel should have been on a best of album for bounty killer. for example "" gal"" and ""you'll never Know"". Also what happened to Living Dangerously, that song definately should have been on this album. I know"" Mi caa Beleive Mi eyes"" is farely new, but most would already consider that as one of his all time best songs. Also missing ""Fed up "", ""suspense"", ""seek god"". Not a bad album, but could have been better."
1,Don't bother with this videotape.,"As mentioned in another review, this tape is not what I expected. It is the same 3 videos over and over, obviously recorded over some other video presentation. It looks like this tape was part of a mass production involving used videotapes! My intent was to write to the production company involved to complain, but I didn't see an address on the video cover. If you don't already have these Ricky Martin videos, you may want to have it, but it certainly is not worth the price asked, considering that Ricky's videos will probably all be available soon from a credible production company."
1,Caution-This Video Doesn't Give You Much for the Money,"There are only three videos on this tape, LLVL, SAIEH, and SYBB. The first two are on also the RM video collection which has several other videos including La Bomba, Maria, and the live 1999 Grammy performance of TCOL. SYBB is a great video, but not at this price! If you love Ricky Martin, buy the official RM video collection and you'll get a lot more for the purchase price. If you've got money to burn, go ahead and get this one too."
5,AWW NUTS!!,"No, these are very very good really. Perfect size, fresh and salty. Not too many peanuts at all, just about right on that. Really big pieces of walnuts, pecans and cashews, good flavor.These would be perfect to pass out at Christmas in a ""goody bag"" or something."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased this vacuum based on the great reviews; however, I wish I hadn't. Terrible on carpets even with the special carpet attachment and will only pick up the smallest items on hardwood floors. If you have a leaf or a penny, forget it. I have to sweep my hardwood floors BEFORE I vacuum because even the smallest little piece of paper or other household fluff gets left behind. The bag is the tiniest, very expensive, and only fills 1/3 of the way before the machine tells you it's full. ONLY good thing is the retractable cord. As soon as I get this thing paid off, I'm buying another brand as soon as possible"
5,great purchase,"I purchased this vac after reading reviews of how quiet it is, and was not disappointed. Our house is small (1000sq. ft.) , and though others say the cord is short, I can do the whole thing without unplugging. We have hardwood floors and only 2 small area rugs so the standard attachments are fine. I really like the carpet/wood floor switch on the top of the floor nozzle- easy & convenient. The hose is more flexible than the cheap plastic you find on most other vacs, and so is the cord. The wheels turn easily, so I'm not bumping into furniture or walls with the canister. The bags may be small, but the pet hair doesn't get stuck in the filters and clog everything up like on the bagless models I've had. It's pricy, but already outlasted its predecessor. Well worth the money."
5,miele carina canister vacuum,"Although spendy, this vacuum rocks!!!! I have a 3 year old boy, a great dane and my old man has a wood shop in the basement. This vac picks up dried up mac & cheese, dog hair and saw dust. I have MS and it's easy to maneuver and store. The cord could be longer, but that hasn't been too much trouble. I highly recommend this vac, I hope to have it for years."
2,Cute but not powerful enough,"I have had this vacuum for about 3 years now. I wanted to love it so much (especially considering the price!) but my final verdict is: Disappointing. Pros: Elegant design, lightweight, easily maneuverable, works great on hard wood floors, quiet operation so as not to scare the pets.Cons: TINY dust bags CONSTANTLY need replacement and are EXPENSIVE. Doesn't have enough power to really clean carpet (even with $129 addition of Turbo Brush), doesn't do a good job on pet hair on couch.So in the end I have to say it is not the vacuum of my dreams, and I will not be purchasing another of this type. Maybe next time I'll try one of those Dyson contraptions, if I can afford it."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased the Miele Carina vacuum to replace a Kenmore canister vacuum that is falling apart.The Kenmore, even in its dilapidated state is a better vacuum for the same price as the Miele. The controls for the Miele are on the canister itself which requires the user to bend down every time he or she wishes to change the setting. The floor/carpet switch on the head is hard to switch and again requires the user to bend down.It is OK for use on a floor, we have saltillo tile and it works OK. But on low pile carpeting it was incredibly hard work pushing the vacuum around.I'm sticking with my old Kenmore."
5,A Consumer Note...,Amazon's listed dealer would not ship to Vermont where I live. A little research shows that there are a multitude of estabished dealers who carry Miele as official dealers. Almost all offer free shipping to all 48 contiguous states. The price is pretty much fixed at $379.00. Most provide 2nd day free shipping.
1,"Little history, dull geography","Geography can be enthralling, especially when it is shown as a vital factor in shaping the history of a place and its inhabitants.Professor East offers precious little enthusiasm to either history or geography in this dry, pedantic and limited tract. Instead, he writes defensively as though he expects readers to be historians looking to shoot holes in the theory that ""place"" helps to shape ""events."" By the time he has defended the idea, I was bored (with his use of ""palimpsest"" among other things) rather than sold.Hurrying to Chapter 2 to get beyond his podium, I found him mired in the details of England's mapping...an unlikely springboard into the wonders of the ""geography behind history.""Sorry, but by the time this book approaches a spark of excitement, it felt more like an electric charge to restart my cardium.Read this at your own risk, if you need an item for a bibliography, or as a sleep aid."
3,slow slow slow,"Ok - so seriously? People thought this their favourite? I've actually only read 6 of her books right now. While this wasn't my least favoured it's certainly not the best. Looking back I can see the storyline and events, but while I was reading it I felt as if I was wading through molasses or something. I was so relieved when I finally finished the book. I wanted to know the outcome so I just had to plod on.Overall I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who is trying to get into Heyer and can't decide which one to read first, but it isn't too bad for someone who has already been introduced to her."
5,A convenient read,"With all the buzz around this particular book of Ms Heyer's, I was quite nervous to read it. True, this book is different than the usual type of fantasy regency books readers are accustomed to read by Heyer, it's very sedate, featuring two characters -Adam and Jenny-- possessing sense and good judgment. Both the hero and heroine have sacrificed a great deal to provide comfort and convenience for the other despite their contracted marriage. Yes, you will not be swept off your feet reading this book, but you can not help smiling turning each page; a very warm and realistic story."" Lord, if we were all to marry our first loves what a plague of ill-sorted marriages there would be!"" Lord Oversley- A Civil Contract(need I say more ? A pleasant read)"
3,humdrum Heyer,"A quieter (more cynical?) Heyer - not the frothy fun of most of her other books. Reads as though she is older and more wearily aware of the realities of (rather than poking the borax at) social strictures. Still a fun read, recommended light relief from serious literature - should you ever find yourself so burdened!"
4,Writing From Another Time,"This is the first book by Georgette Heyer I've read. She pretty much founded the Regency genre; both the short ones and the historicals owe a lot to her. The other reviewers have helpfully discussed the book's merits. I would simply add that, while I enjoyed this classic marriage-of-convenience story, I found the writing far more distant than what one might be accustomed to from today's authors. I always knew I was reading. I never felt like I was there inside the story with the characters. She uses a lot of historically accurate terms and cant, which is interesting but does take you out of the story somewhat. The meaning is obvious from the context, but you have to think about it all the same. I plan to read a number of her other books, and I look forward to learning from her, but I'll be curious to see if I can feel more connected to the characters and the story as I go along."
4,Misplaced Emphasis,"Regardless of the title, Ginsberg features minorly in this- other poets got more translations in.And most of this book is a lengthy study of Renga, not haiku or the difficulties of translation (go read ""After babel"" or ""Le Ton De Beau Marot"" for real books on that subject.)And one review got it entirely wrong- Zen has no role in the author's review, he specifically inveighing and excorciating the blind assumption of Zen influence in haikus."
4,I passed!,"Good for memory tricks, but not so much for explanation of material, bottom line, good to pass test, but to truly learn the material, another book would be needed."
3,Extra Class,"I'd suggest the ARRL over this book. Essentially, it covers the question pool, which can be done online. The ARRL book actually covers the material."
1,Save your money . . .,"I bought this ""overpriced"" three ring binder. What was I thinking? Some of the ""important"" material is outdated. You'd think Mr. Harmon would have updated it as many laws have changed since he wrote it. Order the ""Investment Advisor Registration Package"" from the SEC for free. That's where much of the material comes from. The rest is just content that has to do with starting a business. By the way this ""binder"" has nothing to do with starting a mutual fund company but an investment advisory company."
3,For Older Children or Adults,This game was better suited for my pre-teen but my younger child could not play it. It was to difficult and actually they both lost interest. They complained that it was to difficult to control the monkey in the ball. I tried to play this game and had some difficulty but I am really not a gamer.
3,Could've been alot better...,"I'd have to say that this movie would be okay as a rental, so don't be quick to drop $15-20 to buy it brand new. The film certainly has its funny moments, which I won't give away, but overall the movie just seemed kind of stale and goofy. What ""The Jurk"" said below me is true, that this is just some dinky little studio product of a movie that was made by people who were too scared to offend anybody and could've been alot better in the hands of an independent film maker. So, if you're bored on a Friday night, go ahead and pick this up, but not to own."
5,Hillarious!,"If you are looking for a good laugh, this movie is great! Bernie Mac does an amazing job as always (may he rest in peace.) Love this movie!"
4,say what you will,"this movie has at least three layers i can count that involve love in dating, love in marriage, and love during the exciting time of proposals and weddings. tie that in with consideration for race, culture, personal and public opinions with and without a sense of humor and this movie cannot be beat. attack it from the light hearted, romantic, hollywood comedy angle and you lose again, it has heart, it makes one think, and it is enjoyable over and over again. i miss bernie mac."
2,very uncanilly similar to meet the parents...,"the only differences between this and meet the parents are:1. the womans family are black and did not know her new boyfriend was white.2. meet the parents wasn't this awful.they are the only differences. this film tries very hard to be funny, and only suceeds a handful of times. very mediocre and quite dull. if you must watch it, wait until it comes out on dvd or video."
2,Just because Ashton was in it,"I was really looking forward to watching this because Ashton is adorable and Bernie is a riot, but I was really disapointed. I had to give it 2 stars though because I still love both of these actors.The start of the film seemed to try too hard at ""funny"", and poured out a lot of sarcasim, and then it eased off and there were parts that were unexpectedly silly. But about part way through it seemed to change over from comedy to mushy love story and will the boy get the girl? (which of course you know he will, he's Ashton)I guess at Amazon's prices its worth the buy, if you REALLY like these guys/actors."
3,This movie is OK,"I'm sitting here watching it right now at work. I'm actually glad that I did not pay $6.50 to see it. There are some funny jokes, but I can predict the ending. I agree with whomever said this is more like Meet the Parents....Ashton is not even CLOSE to being as funny as Ben Stiller though.Rent it at BB....Oh, and they could have picked a different daughter. I wasn't feeling Zoe."
2,"Copy of ""Meet the Parents""","Some funny moments, but generally a bore. I felt this movie was a copy of Meet the Parents - just substituting actors and adding a racial element for humour and dramatic effect."
2,Bad Remake,"This is a poor remake of the far superior ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"" from the mid-sixties. The first and most important problem is that the topic and main subject of dialogue is an anachronism. Interrational relationships used to be an issue and the original film was a smart approach to tough subject matter. It opened the issue up for discussion among the masses. Because it is a dead issue this remake attempts to inject a dose of humor. The result is campy mess. There is little in this DVD to be entertained by, let alone challenged. Bernie Mac is funny and offers a couple of lines that produce a chuckle. He should be in more true comedy films. Ashton Kutcher is unwatchable, i.e. the new Adam Sandler. Zoe Saldana is gorgeous and does a nice job but this DVD is a waste of time. Rent the original instead."
1,Funny! Not.,This movie should be good...yeah right! Think of it as Meet the Parents with racist jokes.
1,Guess What's Coming: BAD MOVIE,"GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER this is not. This film is not much of anything. However, it is thought provoking. And it has provoked me to sum it up in a single word: sacrilegious. This is a monument to bad taste to the efforts of director Stanley Kramer and actors Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier and all the other filmmakers who gave us the original GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER. 1967's GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER was a timely classic. 2005's GUESS WHO is untimely to say the least and is a grotesque monument to the entrepreneurial efforts to make some quick dollars off the original film, which has become a Hollywood trend these days. What ever happened to ingenuity and originality in filmmaking? Look elsewhere."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I saw this movie and Taxi on the same day and this is by far the worst of the two. As lame and boring as Jimmy Fallon was in Taxi, Ashton Kutcher is worse. This was billed as a comedy and I did not find anything even remotely funny in it. Bernie Mac tries to be tough (a la Robert DiNero in Meet the Parents) but fails miserably to be convincing.The only bright spot in the movie is the actress who plays Bernic Mac's wife who gets mad at Mac for not taking seriously their planned remarriage and goes to bond with her sister and girlfriends. The rest of this putrid attempt at comedy really leaves a bad taste in your mouth and makes you wish you had gotten Sidney Potier's movie instead."
3,I guess it is worth watching.,"A white guy is engaged to a black woman. When he meets her father they don't get along, but don't worry, they eventually like each other. It wasn't bad, but Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher had no chemistry, they lacked that connection that makes a great comedy team."
4,Guess Who,Really enjoyed this movie and the price online was cheaper than buying it from a store and I didn't have to leave my home.
1,Disappointing,"With such a strong cast, I was expecting more - a lot more! The only thing this movie delivered was an overly predictable script and a very stale plot."
4,"Pretty funny, if you can get past the embarassment","I thought that the movie was pretty funny, but there were so many places during the movie where I cringed with embarassment for Ashton's character. He had to jump through some major hoops and not a soul on her side of the family was truly helping. Being in an interracial marriage myself, I understood some of the uncomfortable scenes. There was quite a bit of stereotypical mumbo jumbo that seems to always be put in movies on this topic, but all in all a pretty good little comedy. As a side note, I thought they made such a cute couple. Thumbs up in my opinion."
1,Awful.,"I think I laughed once in the entire movie - when Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"" came on the radio as Bernie Mac switched stations while riding with Ashton Kutcher. Then, of course, they had to ruin the joke by having ""Ebony and Ivory"" come on the radio moments later, turning a mildly humorous moment into a lame and obvious one. The actors do their best, but the script is terrible and the direction uninspired. I actually found it more compelling to watch my cat clean himself than follow the ""plot"" of this dud. But I smelled ""dog"" after the first 5 minutes, so I can't say I was too disappointed. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher sure make some lousy movies. Put this one at the top of this list. Not even the 5 minute gag reel included on the DVD was funny. Now that ought to tell you something."
3,Good Movie,"I really wasn't sure what to expect when we rented this movie. It was better than I thought it would be. There were moments or romance, love, bitterness, and I thought that it was a good movie. There were a lot of things that I guestioned because they never really went into a lot of detail about anything {his work, their relationship, etc} I know that he was in love with her, but It was hard to find the reasons why. You never got to see their relationship, only the pressure of going to meet the future In-laws for the first time.I would rent it but can't support the purchase."
3,More of Mike Epps,"I enjoyed watching this film. However, not as well as the first--Guess Who's coming to dinner? If they would have included more of Mike Epps in the film....much more laughs!!!"
3,Not as bad as I had expected.,"I think the fact that I had low expectations for this movie is why I enjoyed the movie at all. There are some funny parts in there.I thought the biggest problem with the movie was that the race bits were a bit overdone to the point where it seemed like the movie was no longer a comedy but a commentary on society and...oh what's that? Football with pillows? OK. And so on. Also, things were predictable like the scene with the black jokes; they got ""out of hand"" right when I knew they would.I guess if you see this movie expecting a lighthearted comedy with elements of a deep social commentary all pulled off perfectly, you'll probably be disappointed. If you see it with low expectations like I had, you might be surprised. Though I guess I kinda ruined the surprise right there, so forget I said anything."
4,"You like comedy, Guess who is very funny!","Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are so good together! It is not a deep thinking movie. It's a comedy, we are not going to solve big racial problems because of the movie, it's just a cute love story that has some race issues in it. I think it's good to see it from a black family that has to accept a white guy instead of the normal ""How does a white family deal with their son/daughter bringing home a black person"" because it goes both ways, black families are not always over joyed in having someone white brought into the family. Over all it's a love story, is it a perfect love story? No. Is it a chick flick? Probally. Are you going to cry? Maybe breifly once or twice.Are you going to laugh? Heck yes, it's funny! Are you going to enjoy it? If you are a girl I say YES!"
1,Dreadful - Destined for the Trash Bin,"Couldn't get past twenty minutes. This is a humorless, predictable poor excuse of a movie. For a comedy, this doesn't have much of a comedic set up either. Plus - Ashton Kuchner hasn't appeared in a movie I liked yet. And did anyone notice a total lack of chemistry between the actors? This will have you rushing to watch Meet the Parents again. (PS I did not buy this film - it was given to me by someone who worked on it.)"
3,Not Bad,"Although I did not think Ashton and Zoe had great chemistry in this film I thought it was worth watching. I found it to be very funny and touching at times. There were things about the movie that seemed odd, but how many movies are perfect. I am not a big Ashton Kutcher fan becuase he drives me crazy with his big mouth, but I thought he did an okay job with this movie.I would recommened anyone to see this movie with an open mind. Just know up front it's not great and it's not horrible but you should be entertained."
4,U can watch it a few times,I bought it to watch it when I am travelling. I carry my PSP only when I am flying. This is an ok movie to watch a couple of times.
2,Guess What......Guess Who isnt that great of a movie,"Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love, Dude Where's My Car?) plays Simon who is dating Percy's, Bernie Mac (Mr. 3000, Ocean's 11 and 12), daughter but there's one problem with Simon that Percy sees, that's he's white and his daughter is black. Let's say it rings on on Meet The Parents just a little too much even though this is about an interracial couple. They said they had to spend millions of dollars editing out Kutcher's red Kaballah braclet in evern scene he was in which I laughed my ass off because that's so ridiculous.... Kutcher isnt funny in this movie...he's funny in That 70's Show but he isnt funny here. Bernie Mac anchors the film as the Dad. Also starring Mike Epps (Next Friday, The Honeymooners). Hey, dont mind me I'm just jotting down my opinions, like it or not."
3,One Time Only,"Bernie and Ashton try to bring their A game to this film but fails to really capture anything special by the end. ""Guess Who"" is a funny film about a black girl bringing home her white boyfriend to see her parents who, especially the dad, is shocked to discover that their daughter's boyfriend is white. It is a good setup for some hilarious moments, which it does have some, but only for a one time viewing. I have never seen the original film that this movie is based on, so I can't compare this to the original ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" Yeah, this movie has some really funny parts but I tried to watch it again and it wasn't as good the second time around. So it is worth renting, but definitely probably not worth buying unless you either love the original and want the remake or you are a big Ashton/Bernie fan. Other than that, this is only rental worthy."
1,Disappointing,Not a very sturdy tool. Mine broke after very little use.The shaft is flimsy and the hoe is secured very poorly. It broke with very light use and the handle split so far the hoe fell out. The end of the hoe that had been in the handle was bent.I would not recommend this tool to anyone.
2,Not worth it,"You can do better, disappointed with price to quality ratio. Flimsy I would send back but shipping cost make it not worthwhile. Also the box they shipped in was huge."
4,Nice hoe,I bought this for my husband because he wanted a hoe with a fiberglass handle. It's very nice but the handle length is too short for him (he's only 5'-9) and it is now mine.
3,"Harum Scarum, High Value","Harum Scarum was knocked down by many as the worst Elvis film. However, the soundtrack is fantastic with a great desert beat great songs such as :Go East Young Man and Shake That Tambourine.The price is kinda high but it is worth it with good packaging and fantastic photos. Another downside is the ""NEW"" Bonus Tracks which are really alternate takes and they sound just like the released versions. If I were you I would strongly recommended buying this nice album."
3,ahead of his time,"Leigh Bowery was ahead of his time. All these new ""shock"" artists cannot live up to Leigh. The movie let me know more about him and his art."
3,Basic Greek History,"Ancient Greek society is a pretty elaborate topic and this book only touches on the basic principles of this place in history. Really only for the casual reader, the book only briefly touches on the ""important"" aspects of Greece such as science, religion, art, military, architecture, etc. In describing these things the author does not go into any sort of deatil, only giving you a taste of it. Eventhough it is not written for a serious historian it does do a good job of giving you an idea of the society that was Greece."
1,Author has a very NEGATIVE ATTITUDE.,"We all would love to heal ourselves so I too was interested in this book...the title caught my attention. If you have arthritis, or nail fungus, or dry skin, or insomnia maybe this book would be helpful to you, BUT if you have chest pain, chronic cough, or chronic rash, or blood in your stool...PLEASE don't rely on this book. Instead, seek advice from a trained, licensed PHYSICIAN. Aside from the obvious, it was so depressing...just what the ill person DOES NOT NEED. I love reading, and honestly I've never given a negative review on any book."
4,How you can save yourself and others by reading this book,"As I have a rare form of cancer (mesothelioma) with no real known cure this book was one I was told about that may help.It has, and it should be read by all those with so-called incurable diseases, as it explains how much power we have in our own minds and body's when we take control of our own illness.And when you feel in control it changes your perception of what is uncontronable.I believe all the current medicos should read this and start realizing the incredible power the body has to heal itself and stop relying on all the drugs that are really the big killers of the day.Not only that in his book Robyn Cousin's says that over 90% of all visits to the doctor could eliminated if people knew about this.Knowledge is power and reading this book will give you power.Ron Sullivan"
3,Limited readership,This book is very detailed in its medical orientation. There were also way too many details in general. I found repetition of facts and theories. The first and last chapters were the best. This book has a very limited readership appeal.
2,shattered expectations,"What I expected was some hints on how one can utilize humor and laughter when in dire medical circumstances. What I got was basically a technical dissertation on the value of Vitamin C in the author's specific case. A very short book with little content. Instead, buy a book by Bernie Siegel, such as Love, Medicine, and Miracles, which is worth reading over and over again."
3,"Good book, but no need to re-read","I enjoyed this book as a doctor in training. I did sell it though after I read it, because it's one of those books you'll never need/want to re-read again. Would be a good kindle book."
5,Excellent read,I am a physician and this book was a great read. It is one man's personal perspective into his own disease and his pontification on the health care system. Highly recommend. It is a non-scientific book and easy to read.
3,The Stolen Bike,"The kid in this book has always had her big sisters hand-me-downs.She's sick of not having her own stuff.One day she sneaks her sisters bike out of the house to take a ride.But the bike is stolen and she doesn't know how to tell her sister!!!!!!What is she going to do?!I think Sweet Valley Twins,Jessica and the Money Mix-up is a similiar book,also by Francine Pascal."
1,Fitness at Home 7: Gymnastics & Abs Exercise,Very disapponited with the purchase. The person on the cover does not feature in the DVD at all. The DVD is very dark and difficult to see. The excercises are not at all what was expected. A real loss and certainly not worth your money.
5,dPhilc's Review,"An interesting and comical text, composed of a selection of British ghost stories with sexual innuendo. These short stories are sure to leave the reader in a fit of laughter."
2,For hamsters,They have not touched them at all. I have different chew sticks and they eat them.. So did not work for me
3,Bunny can take 'em or leave 'em,"Our 4 month old bunny will chew these, but not unless you put them right in front of him and encourage him to do so. He chews other things, he just doesn't seem to have much interest in these for whatever reason. I don't think it's necessarily a bad product, just depends on the pet's personal preferences I think."
5,Awesome!! what a Beautiful voice!!,"This is the first that I have actually heard Sanchez's voice, and what an experience!! I look forward to the cd"
1,Yawn,"The first song is great. The second song is less great because it is like the first song. The third song... Need I say more. And I like Tammy Wynette, especially when she and George Jones are being repetitious, but, by herself, maybe office music for a Southern divorce lawyer's waiting room."
5,HI IM MARIE ANTOINETTE KIMMONS.IT WAS CRUEL WHAT THEY DID.,"MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS A FAIR AND GREAT QUEEN SHE JUST SAID ONE LINE AND WAS PUNISHED HER HUSBAND WAS THE ONE DOING WRONG NOT HER SHE DIDNT DESERVE WHAT SHE GOT AND I THINK ALL THE TOWN SHOULD FEEL GUILTY FOR WHAT THEY DID. SIGNED, MARIE ANTOINETTE KIMMONS"
3,A Work of Its Time,"A careful and conciously political work that is not so much an autobiography as we know it today, but rather a political anthem of its time. Thirty years on, the canon of African-American feminist literature could use a true biography of this iconic activist."
1,For communists unrepentant,"Not a particularly interesting or politically compelling book, except maybe to devout communists (are there any?) A radical departure from the left and just causes. Even Alexander Solzhenitsyn railed against her since she said she felt that USSR dissidents deserved imprisonment"
1,don't waste your time,One of the most socially divisive works I have ever read. In it Angela clearly continues establishment efforts to try to guilt trip America into giving her and other minorities a free pass to commit their own form of oppression in this day and age. Not worth the sitting required to read it.
