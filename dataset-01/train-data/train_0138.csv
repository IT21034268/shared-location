5,"A Must Have,,,,","I just had to have this on my Ipod with Xmas coming up,,,great song,,,some of GM's (Wham) best,,,,, I think this Xmas song will be around for quite a while."
3,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"All while watching The Girl, the feature film debut of Swedish director Fredrik Edfeldt, I kept thinking to myself, Why are Swedish films so damn bleak? I was never able to come up with a logical answer, but that didn't stop me from appreciating this thoughtful rumination about childhood.Read the rest of my review here:[...]"
4,Supposed to be a comedy,"I guess what some people and especially different cultures, think is funny is not necessarily funny to me. I felt sorry for the men so desperate to go to America. He was taken advantage of and even beaten to find at the end his true desire and happiness. I bought the movie to be able to listen to original FARSI language. This part was OK."
1,How does something this bad get made?,"I got tricked into renting this movie because of the reference to Left Behind on the box cover. While the movie has some similar elements to that series such as ongoing catastrophic events, there is absolutely no attempt by the moviemakers to tie them to the actual story (such as it is). These events are instead incidental to the story of a mom trying to find her daughter. One she's reunited, and after she runs into some shadow group who's purpose is never really explaind, the story ends. Stay far, far away from this movie and rent/buy instead Left Behind with Kirk Cameron or the Apocalypse series."
2,It was ok but not the one I wanted,It was kind of boring really ls ls ls ls ls ls slsl sls sls ls sl ssls ls s
2,What was that?,"This is not at all what I expected. I can't believe this is from a John Hagee book. I just didn't make much sense to me. Maybe I just didn't get it. I am willing to try another one of his movies for good measure. All is not lost, yet."
3,Felt a bit taken as I was adamently looking for Jerusalem Countdown. I already have two copies of Countdown: Jerusalem.,This is an OK movie but am really looking forward to the Jerusalem Countdown. Since the titles are close I was adament about looking for the correct one but somehow got the wrong one delivered again.... hmmm. So another stocking stuffer.
5,The best of the best,These balldrivers are made in the USA and are of excellent quality. I have these and also the L-shaped. These are the best you can buy.
5,"Well made, solid, wish it came with a case / holder","A friend has a similar set from Bondhus but his has a nifty case where the set fits. Well made, very solid, practical, use them a ton - just a pain to carry them around individually and wish they'd charge me more, but include a case for them to neatly fit into!"
5,Crucial to theory of anxiety,"Often overlooked, this concise exploration of origins and manifestations of anxiety is often brilliant and provocative. Freud explores the basic properties of fear, anxiety, and touches on the sexual component of these human states of mind/body. Freud hypothesizes that the origin of anxiety is founded in the repressed memory of the human's separation from the mother's originary nutrition during the act of birth. All manifestations of anxiety are (in essence) a resurgence of this primal fear. This is crucial to the role of biology and nourishment to psychoanalysis, often glossed over in its modern variants."
3,One out of three aint bad,"if not for the first short ""The Hand"" this movie would have gotten one star. The Hand was this films only redeeming quality. The second short being partial to Robert Downey Jr I tried to make some understanding but I couldn't. And the third I just gave up after watching a second time. The other redeeming factor of this film was the music especially the track at the beginning."
2,Boring and quite uneven,"The three stories are quite uneven, being the Wan Kar Wai's segment the most interesting: well acted, well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line. However, the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep. The Steven Soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens. The Antonioni piece is the most disappointing one, not only for being the worst but for being Anyonioni's. It's absolutely pointless and confusing; in many instances, it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student. It's a pity it's Antonioni's since his reputation deserves more than this. Only for the Wan Kar Wai piece, I give this movie 2 stars."
4,Another Steeleye gem,"Although falling just short of the standards set by their previous album ""Below the Salt,"" Steeleye's fifth album is another gem of a record,The theme is the same - centuries old British folk songs adapted for a modern audience. Standouts this time out include ""One Mist Moisty Morning,"" ""The Bold Poachers,"" ""The Wee Man"" the haunting ""Rogues in a Nation"" and the odd, but sublime ""Cam Ye O'er Frae France."" The only flat out clunker here is the brief ""Robbery with Violins,"" a short instrumental which probably worked better in theory than in practice. On the whole, not Steeleye's best, but one very much worthy of their normally lofty standards."
3,Traditional electric folk,There are 4 songs on the album that are so good in this venue I wondered why they never got to be a more well known group in the USA. Some stuff should have been left out of this album or replaced with better songs.
3,Not one of their best,"While I loved One Misty Moisty Morning, Cam Ye Oer from France, the others are less than great, except for Maddy's magnificent voice. I too suggest Below the Salt, as well as Please to See the King, which is just beautiful."
3,Not Steeleye's Best Album,"My main motive for penning this is to steer the potential reader/listener/buyer toward Steeleye Span's true masterpiece which is 'Below The Salt', the album they released before this. Although 'Parcel Of Rogues' contains some great moments, (as always, Maddy Prior's voice is a revelation and 'Rogues In A Nation' is a great song with wonderful group harmonies), this album is also hampered with some truly dire moments like the execrable 'Alison Gross' and 'The Wee Wee Man.' I fail to understand why this release is uniformly hailed as the best Steeleye Span record. 'Below The Salt' has so much more to recommend it. There is nothing quite like its authentic atmosphere of cavernous medieval acid folk rock. The human race can be divided into two groups; those who have heard 'Saucy Sailor' and those who have not. So save your pennies for 'Below The Salt', people, and get on with it."
5,Lots of information,"DREAMWEAVER MX EXTENSIONSAUTHOR: Laura GutmanPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Let's create a floating panel. Oh, don't know how? Then check out Chapter 7 in Part II. Let's work with the DOM and the API. Hmmm, don't know what that is either? Check out Chapter 4 for DOM and Chapter 1 for API. Part III, Appendixes will give you a working view of JavaScript. Custom Objects and Behaviors can also be found in ""Dreamweaver MX Extensions"".There is no CD included with this book but there is plenty of good explanations and even a bit of graphics to show what is being discussed. Also included throughout the book are actual HTML sections for a reader to use.For anyone who wants to make Dreamweaver really work, they should pick up this book. [This] provides over 500 pages of information. Great price for all the information contained in ""Dreamweaver MX Extensions""."
2,Covering many topics. a little verbose and rough.,"I have to say it's really ""basic"". I didn't mean that it's worthless.But it's not worth the price. It suits the one who is interested in horsemanship but doesn't have any experience in riding . The major drawback is the pictures or graph are not enough for the reader to make a precise and vivid image of what the author trys to present. And this is quiet helpful for novice riders.isn't it?"
5,Simply amazing.,"I almost can't gather the adjectives to describe the album. The vocals are beautiful, the piano powerful, the lyrics deep and insightful. There is no song on this album i dislike, and several that compete for my favorite.If you like cheery music, this won't be the album for you, but it's not depressing or morbid. Just somber and introspective, beautifully written and beautifully sung. Simply beautiful.I'm tremendously impatient for Ellery to come out with a new album, i'll buy it without listening to a single phrase or song. I'm not sure how they could do a song i wouldn't love, wouldn't grab my various friends and force them to listen to it regardless of what other pressing obligations they have."
4,"Overall, a pretty good format","This is the first ""online"" type of training I have tried from MS. I enjoyed the lecture-style format as opposed to the book-training kits. I agree that it needs to be complemented with Books On-line and Inside SQl Server. But, I definitely came away with some practical experience which I am now using on the job. Knocks on the course, for improvement:The unit on web publishing, with the wrong quiz questions. They should gear the exercises to a higher level. If someone is using this material, MS should make the assumption that we don't need to be told ""to close Microsoft Outlook (or any other application) , click the close button"". All of these types of statements could have been left out, and more content added to the course.Despite this, it is still a good way to learn the material and I look forward to continuing to the next one."
3,tyrone power messes up another one,"does it seem that ive been watching a lot of tyrone power movies? believe me, its purely coincidence as i get caught up on all these academy award winners. this adaptation of somerset maughams novel was a BIG movie when it came out, and sad to say (as usual) power was not up to the task. while clifton webb, anne baxter, and (even) gene tierney give strong performances, power is just not up to the task (and yes, folks, i DID see the bill murray movie, and yes, bill WAS better). the movies take on far eastern philosophy is shallow, and never having read the book (and its not in my top 500 to read) i dont know if the fault lies with maugham or 20th century fox or both. still, theres alot of fun opulence and hamminess to enjoy, so id recommend it to the curious."
3,Not my favorite version,"Although the Bill Murray version is difficult to take serious due to his history of comedy, I have a much easier time seeing the inner anguish and turmoil in him than in this version. I expect to see the personal journey in the actor's face, and here, the expression never seems to change.This version is also a little dated. The setting is still the same, after World War I, but the movie-making is a little behind the times for me. I prefer to see as much realism as possible. For instance, our ""hero"" treks to India to study with one of the masters. In this version, the guru is played by a ""tanned"" Englishman rather than a true Indian. Given the time this was filmed, this is fairly standard.Given that this is from the Maugham book, I really can't say that there are any memorable performances in this film. Most lines I attribute to the book rather than the film.I would not recommend seeing this version if you had the choice between the different versions."
2,The Razor's Edge,"I had expected The Razor's Edge to be a much better film than it was. After reading the summary of the film on its box I thought it sounded interesting and rented it from my local video store. I was extremly disappointed with the film. I thought the basic plot of the film was good, but the movie seemed exaggerated and unbelivable to me. Another problem I had with the film was that I didn't like any of the characters. I hated Gene Tierney's character. She was a snob and ruined various people's lives out of greed and vanity. Clifton Webb is an annoying presence in all of his films. Suprisingly Tyrone Power did a good job in this film. His acting wasn't as stiff as it is in some of his other films. I still didn't like his charactor, however. I thought Anne Baxter did a very good job in this film. I felt so sorry for her. She was the only person in the entire film that I liked. Although I managed to get through the entire film I would never watch it again..."
3,Did people really live like this?,"This adaptation of Somerset Maugham's classic novelThe Razor's Edgeis a period piece that displays the craft of the major studios at its height. The film stays reasonably close to the novel, but the characters are far less nuanced. Gene Tierney's Isabel is a flighty socialite who sells herself for ""a square cut diamond and sable coat,"" as Maugham in the role of narrator says. Uncle Elliot doesn't come off as the superficial, generous and ultimately heartbreaking character he is in the novel. And due to the mores of the time, the seedier side of Larry's (Tyrone Power) adventures is eliminated. Nevertheless, the movie is lavishly filmed, and you'll enjoy the country club dances, gorgeous decor, and spiffy dress. To get to the essence of why this book is Maugham's most well-known, however, read it."
5,Before PTSD,"I am ""hooked"" on Bill Murray's ""The Razor's Edge"" and have recommended it to both PTSD sufferers and to family members for a different type of insight than ""The Deer Hunter"" and other PTSD movies. In this version the book is followed much more closely and a slightly different slant is given to the character ""Larry"" but the amazing thing is the way that the PTSD that Larry suffers shows through. I have recently purchased both versions for a friend of mine in the medical field who will be stationed in Afgan soon - hoping they watch both (along with some of Paul Fussell's books) prior to being in country and having to deal with the very problems projected by ""Larry"" in both versions of this outstanding novel adaptation."
1,You do not want this stuff,"The best smelling glade plug-in is tropical mist. Tracking down the aerosol was nearly impossible and took many years. Once you buy this tr+sh, you'll know why.One. it smells nothing like the plug-in, though branded identically.Two. It has an overpowering chemical undertone, and barely any scent at all.The mixture was clearly discontinued by Glade after they realized they couldn't get it right and that this can of stink held no appeal for anyone."
2,glade tropical mist,I was hoping it was the same as Glade Fabric & air odor eliminator. it doesn't smell the same way..
3,The book is a little dirty,"The book is a little dirty. But since the price is low and it is ok to read, it is still good to buy it..."
1,Don't buy this book to learn Java ...,"... if you want compare your solutions to the exercises with the author's. You will have to shell out another $20 directly to the author for solutions to the exercises -- if he ever gets around to completing the writing of those solutions. At the time I am writing this review, almost 15 months have passed since the book was published -- but still no solutions to the exercises. The author's last newsletter, circulated four weeks ago, said their publication was ""imminent"". I wonder what ""imminent"" means to him?"
1,There are much better books out there.,"Don't buy this book. There are better ones out there for learning Java or using as a reference. This book fails at both, for two reasons:1) Half the book is code examples. Normally, these would be provided online, and you could download them at your leisure. Instead, pages and pages are solid code blocks, interrupting the flow of reading. This makes it hard to learn Java, and hard to use as a reference later on.2) The code provided is poorly written. Not only does it occupy too much space in the text itself, but the code is so poorly formatted as to be unreadable. If any dev working with me formatted their code this way, I would force them to rewrite it.If you're looking to learn Java, you're much better off buying Head First Java. If you're looking for a Java reference, O'Reilly's Learning Java is much better.Overall, I deeply regret purchasing this book."
2,Thinking in Java,"Ok, I have read about 200 textbooks or better in my day, 20 - 30 or so in the programming area, and I have to say this was the worst text book I have ever looked at. It was poorly written and poorly organized."
3,Inclusive but not fun,"Although the book includes the main Java features and libraries (which is positive), I found it a bit boring and way too long. I think that for that amount of pages the reader should get much more insight. I would recommend instead ""Effective Java""."
5,A challenging and ultimately rewarding read,"I don't like computer books that treat you like a kid: you need to go through chapters and chapters before the author starts challenging you. Not this one. TIJ reads like a conversation, moves fast and is always surprising you with interesting programming snippets. Its actually a lot of fun to read and tough to put down!Undoubtedly one of the best books I've read in programming.Read it if you want a non-dumbed down approach to Java."
4,helpful but not a lot of new information,I found that this book provided me with more useful information than the manual that came with the camera. It defines the different modes in more detail and gives more examples about when you would use a feature.
1,Lifespan of a fruit fly.,"I can't complain about the performance of this system WHILE IT WORKED, but in just over a years time I'm staring at a screen flawlessly playing my movie, sans sound. Its as though they built a timer in set to expire shortly after the warranty. I'm sure using it for target practice will do much to soothe my regrets, but only after I have shelled out hard earned dollars for a replacement."
2,Does not last,"Our Philips DVD Home Theatre System HTS3450 just lost all its sound. It is really too bad as the DVD player still works, just no sound. We had it for about 2 years. I hate the thought of having to fill a landfill with all this plastic just because a company can't make a lasting product. I will be looking for a better made system to replace this one. Save your money and the environment and find a better made product."

1,Don't waste your money,I have a koi pond and I had some plants that I wanted to put in it. I came across the Tetra pond aquaplanters and they looked like they would do a great job for the plants. I did just as the directions said and 2 or 3 days later they were collapsed. The dirt was all in the bottom of my pond and the plants were floating. I wouldn't waste my money on them.
5,Made for Each Other dvd,"The purchase experience was flawless, as usual. The movie is a great classic, so couldn't be better. Carole Lombard was so fabulous ... This is an ultimate tear jerker, so get the Kleenex ready."
1,Nonsense,I love Carol Lombard and I adore James Stewart but this was the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. I am sorry I spent money to purchase it even though it was less than $4.
1,KINDLE version is unreadable,"In general I have been pleased w/ Kindle books, this book edition is unfortunately terrible. It is more that just punctuation errors, there are parts of sentences missing. I am very disappointed that such a fine book is unreadable in the kindle edition."
3,a decent work about great ideas by a great writer,C.S. Lewis is a great writer and one of the great accessible Christian minds but I think he got lost in his own theory in this one. This book has some great ideas and is very clarifying in the many senses of Christian love but Lewis gets very verbose and muddy in his heavy essay writing in the Four Loves. I think Lewis does better when he suggests or leads the reader to answers rather than writing and supporting his philosophy and theology in a straightforward manner. The Four Loves is still a worthwhile read but for a great Christain C.S. Lewis read try the Screwtape Letters first.
1,Kindle Version not edited after OCR,"I'm trying to read what should be an excellent book on my Kindle Reader on my iPhone 4. The punctuation is missing on half the sentences. For a paragraph or two, this might be readable, but I can't do this for a whole book! I'm sending it back if possible."
4,"CS Lewis, The Four Loves","A very deep and thoughtful work, from which there is much to be learnt. It is not the type of work that can be read in haste or in one sitting. The discussion on the four loves are much too intense to be glossed over. It is well suited not only for the deeply religious but also for anyone desirous of a greater understanding of the many and important attributes of this one simple word Love."
5,Amazing for all ages,This book truly grips the truth of love and helps people put relationship love and God's love into perspective. I am a teenager who was taken away by Lewis' great work. Any age male or female will be absorbed and grow in wisdom. The book has helped me make decisions that will benefit my future for the better and I am extremely happy to have the chance to read such a great work from an author as talanted as CS Lewis.
5,my daughter needed this for a class.....it was fine,She reaaly enjoyed this book and wrote a great essay about it for her class. Great to add to class reading list.
5,Couldn't put it down!!,"I just can't get enough of C.S. Lewis, I have read each of his books and never been disappointed. Everyone should read."
4,The Four Loves,"Worth reading, but it takes a lot of work to read. Some parts are very datedand don't translate well to modern life."
5,This lamp is absolutely gorgeous!,"Very nice, quality lamp that is just gorgeous when lit up - this is the 3rd Tiffany style lamp I've bought on Amazon and I'm just thrilled with it. This one is unique in that the not only the shade but the body of the lamp lights up as well. Great lamp, price and fast shipping!!! Would absolutely recommend!"
1,extreamly cheap junk,"This is the worst tip up light ever built. It fell apart the first time I turned it on. I am completely disgusted with it and the quality of the product. Friction is the only thing holding the switch together, no screws or even glue! 0 stars!"
5,Excellent,Absolutely one of their best albums. Picked it up on a whim 2 months ago and have not stopped listening to it.
5,Classic CV,Owned this back in the day. Lost it!There's 70 billlion people on Earth. Where are they hiding? Where are they hiding?
1,It Definitely Is NOT Air Tight,"This was a disappointing purchase. It claims to be airtight and it is not. The small door snaps shut but that is it. The container lid does not seal and there are gaps between the lid and the container. This is the first Amazon purchased product that I have been disappointed in -- it is not as advertised.The overall size and functionality was exactly what I was looking for but it is pretty useless if it is not air tight. If you don't care whether your dog food stays fresh or it is not secure from critters then it is a good purchase.Bergan 50-Pound Large Smart Storage, Colors Vary"
3,Very Disappointed,"After reading the previous reviews on here I was expecting to really like this storage bin. When it arrived; I found it to be very flimsy, off center, and it doesn't seal well at all. I would not order this again and will possibly be looking elsewhere for something to replace this product to hold my dog food."
1,Container doesn't close,This container looks good but I did not receive the product in good condition. It seems that due to the packaging the container bent and it doesn't close. Very disappointed as I was looking to store the dog food that I ordered alongwith this container in it and now I am stuck with a huge bag of dog food that will probably go bad.
5,Pet food bin,This is a great container for my cats food. It seals perfectly and is slim so it fits nicely between things and doesn't take up a lot of space. It's also a very good price for a container this size.
3,50 Pound Storage--Not air tight,This product is not airtight. I use it to store cat food indoors so that factor is not as important for my use. The lid can easily be separated from the container while in the closed position. There is a seal where the lid and the container touch but you can lift the lid to stick your fingers in between the lid and the container the seal doesn't do much good.The small opening on the top is great for easier access to scoop cat food out. This is the main reason I decided to not return the product. Ease of use outweighed importance of product being airtight.
2,came broken,"when the storage container arrived the smaller lid was broken and it only grips on one side. I still use it though, but it's tough getting the food out of the bottom when it runs low due to the crevices on the sides"
2,lid would not close,"the container looks very nice but the big lid just would not click and close, i had to return it."
1,almost perfect dog food container,"I really liked this container that I used for dog food, the size and shape of the box is perfect and thought the little door was very handy to reach for the food, that is until one of the two small plastic thingy that hold the small blue door together broke. Now I'm really disappointed as the box don't really close anymore. I suppose the small door is not made for open and close a couple time the day (hungry dog). Too bad as I even liked its color!"
2,Waste of money GBA is still better,I love GBA it has way more fun games and you can also hook it up to your gamecube so kids if you wan't a game system just for you when your lonely and need some excitement. SO we can keep the GBA in popularity.
2,This was the most confusing and boring thing i have ever got,"When i bought this I was expecting to be hooked on to this for hours and hours. Well guess what.I WASN'T. Dont get me wrong, the text messaging and cell phone features is cool but everything else just sucks. The graphics are terrible and the controls are all screwed up. Well I could live without good graphics but the games were just as bad. I don't see why there isn't a game slot so you dont have to take of the hatch..and the battery..and all this other crap I don't feel like explaining. My best advice is to save money and buy a gameboy advance and a cell phone seperately. It's cheaper, better, and SMARTER. The GBA has so many good games and you can buy and mp3 attachment for it. Even though this is a kid's review please take my advice. DO NOT waste your money on this product.Harvest Moon:THE BEST GAME EVER :-D"
4,Looks great,I bought this to make my daughters first birthday cake and although I haven't used it I'm hoping for great things. It looks and feels just like a Wilton pan so I'm going to assume no one replaced the stuck on Wilton paperwork. I find it funny that it had to go from the US to Canada and then back to the US before it got to me though. I'll update my review after my daughters birthday.Update:The cake came out great! I'm not sure how to post a picture with my review otherwise I would because the cake was cute.
3,Mediocre,"So I ordered a LEGENDARY Technics SL-1210 M5G.I paid over $500 for it, and then when I went to a local record store, they had an SL-1200 MK5 for sale for $299. Are the extra features of the 1210 worth the money? Not to me, because I am using it for digital DJing. To a person who still beat-matches, the extra features might be worth it, but I wish I could have just found another 1200 and saved the extra money. In my opinion, even if you are using it for DJing, just get a set of 1200s. Less bells and whistles, less stuff to break, and they can be found for considerably less money."
5,An excellent table,"This turntable performs exceptionally well. I was able to get it up and running with absolutely no experience with vinyl turntables at all. It does come with a headshell, in case you were wondering, because I accidentally ordered another one too. If you're just getting started, there is a very helpful review I found on youtube that can teach you well how to set up the tonearm. It comes with a plastic dust-cover that doesn't attach. It also comes with a slipmat, and a cut wax sheet that helps with scratching. I highly recommend this turntable. Also, consider buying it from [...] it may be cheaper there."
4,History from a personal perspective,"While I enjoy ""Timetables of History"" - all chunked up year by year according to the world's calendar, ""Tolstoy's Bicycle"" makes history personal. If you are 25 look up and see what other people did at age 25. Or maybe you are 65 and want to think of things you might look forward to in the next ten years. I purchased a copy of this book when it was new, and there still is nothing to compare with it. The current purchased copy is for a friend!"
3,Not bad...,"This album further supports my theory that OLD is simply better in E.P. form. While I consider it to be a step up from Visitor, it's still not as good as the first OLD E.P.s.Although The Volunteers is less intimate than Visitor, I believe the songwriting to be a shade more consistent, making for an overall better listen. While few of the tracks live up to the best of OLD, there are some great tunes essential for any fan of Jonah's work.I still miss Far."
3,The Volunteers,"The Volunteers, Jonah's second full length effort as a solo artist, whilst ultimately inconsistent is still undeniably a Jonah CD. The same heartfelt spirit is there and the warm vocals and production that typify Onelinedrawing releases to date. Highlights include 'A Ghost', the heartbreaking 'Stay' and the single of sorts, 'We Had A Deal'. Whilst many would say it isn't up to par with previous releases, Geoff Rickly puts it best when he says on the back of the album ""there (is) still that thread that ties it all together: love"". Definitely worth multiple listens."
4,onelinedrawing with production!!,"great songs...but with great production which is a onelinedrawing first(old onelinedrawing fans don't worry. VOLUNTEERS still has the unique onelinedrawing sound). this cd never was the ONLY cd i listened to a for a week. this album is just as good as the first one and it was written and recorded in less than half the time that it took for the first album. onelinedrawing continues to raise the bar each time he releases something and this is no exceptionbest album of the year easily....the only negative thing i can say is the album, minus the 2 instrumentals, is too short(for me) but it is well worth the money."
2,Dishappointing,"This is a dishappointing release from someone who can put out far, far better than this. The songs rely on the same old onelinedrawing formula but lack the honest, sincere charm that brought previous onelinedrawing releases to life. The only song that comes close to the classic onelinedrawing songs of old is ""Livin' Small"", all the other songs (with the exception of, perhaps, ""We Had A Deal"") seem silly and cheap (I'd say ""Oh Boys"" is a fine example of this).. and where previous songs have excelled with silliness and a simple approach (""Smile"", anyone?)... these songs do not.Download this, but buy everything else Jonah has put out."
1,horrible product,"THIS PRODUCT WAS HORRIBLE! THE HENNA PASTE DRIED BUT NO COLOR OR STAINING WAS LEFT ON THE SKIN. THE PRODUCT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2007 AND EXPIRED IN JAN.2010! I EMAILED COMPANY,HOPEFULLY THEY WILL MAKE IT RIGHT! DON'T RECOMMEND!"
5,animal farm,"What can i say about George Orewell? Classic and readable, thought provoking especially in this day and age. Both books are ageless ."
5,GREAT read...WAY ahead of his time,"These two George Orwell stories are captivating, but you really have to pay attention with every turn of the page so you won't miss any important details. In ""Animal Farm"", it was quite interesting to use animals as the characters because even children could understand its strong message, even if not fully comprehending its value at a young age. In ""1984"" Orwell was WAY ahead of his time with his description of corruption within the government and the unbeknownst oppression of its people. If you really think about how our current government operates, is it really that far-fetched? Scary to think about, but it will make you think, which is a powerful thing."
4,Relates to todays politics,I've only read to chapter 8 so far but I intend to finish it soon. Too much power corrupts with out checks and balances.
4,Classics That Still Ring True,Both of these are great books. The representation of media manipulation written decades ago is especially unnerving in today's world.
3,It's a book.,"We bought this book as a gift for a library. We read the separate books when we were young and they were very educational, showing how people operate when in society itself."
5,Put on your tin foil hat and get ready for two classic novels,"Well, what can I say? You're getting two classic novels for the price of one, and in hardcover. Animal Farm, the classic political allegory of the rise of communism in Russia, and 1984, the infamous story of a future police state with thought-crimes and the omnipresent big brother."
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"Elegant, compelling, apocryphal literature. Sparing no expense for the arrogance of indifference, indignation and political prescience. Orwell captures the subliminal enslavement of the individual in a collective totalitarian society. 1984's thematic elements, and memorable vernacular provide the reader with an original literary exploration. Five out of Five, mail arrived accordingly, Unscathed and pristine condition."
4,Review,George Orwell did a good job writing this book about talkin animals. I liked the way he replaced people for humans. I realized that is also a fake name back in the 1980s you could not be agenst the war or else you would get found and be killed. This book relates during world war 2. The book is written towards the war.The thing I did not like George Orwell did us make the book seem like the animals were so smart to live in a house and use and do things like humans as if they had hands.
4,Two Books in One,The book arrived promptly and in great condition. Animal Farm is well suited for preteen and up as it is a cute book about animals but also an interesting book that explores the strengths of power and corruption. A good price for two novels.
4,looking back,"Publish on Amazon Kindle with Kindle Direct PublishingI have not finished Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"". The reason being that when I got into the book I realized that I needed to review some history in order to appreciate the authors perspective. I knew that it was a satire of communism and socialism. However , which animal in the story represented which person I did not know for sure. I wont go into detail but to say that it must be a great book. I have heard about it all my life. I am anxious to get back to it. Theresa Jacobs"
3,1984,A classic just being read. So many modern books and movies can be traced back to this same plot. Glad I finally read it.
3,Too many typos!,"This is a fantastic piece of literature, but it is befuddled with typos. Amazon, please proof your ebooks before selling them. I'm quite disappointed that every other use of the word ""book"" is spelled ""hook"" and that ""the"" is constantly spelled ""die."""
5,Some books are more equal than others,"Two classics of 20th and 21st century political thought. Animal Farm discusses the dangers of communism and totalitarian governments. 1984 is as relevant today as when it was first published over 50 years ago. I was born in 1984, and even though Big Brother and the Thought Police were not around then, we still might face big government intrusians in the future. As for this edition, two classics handsomely bound in hardcover for under $15, come on people, buy it already!!!"
5,Excellent and frightening fiction!,"Countless analyses have been done in a far more complete fashion than anything I could write here. They are both frightening novels about what happens when your nation goes down the road to Communism. ""Animal Farm"" tells us of the Russian Revolution in the form of a fable with different animals taking the places of historical figures such as Lenin or Stalin. ""1984"" shows us what a world of the near future might possibly look like if the entire world became Communist. Read them if you have an interest in classic fiction that teaches you a harsh lesson about the evils of Communism. If you're a hard-core Left-wing agitator however, you'll think the books are a crock and will hate them."
5,Great book,This classic is a must read. Probably not required reading in most schools today....but it should be. A true classic
5,Among The Best,"1984 is such a classic for anyone to read. You can enjoy it as a simple story, or you can spend the rest of your life trying to interpret (or create your own) metaphors and symbolic references. It's something EVERYONE needs to read."
3,Over Hyped,"Controversial aspects brought me interest in these books, being banned from schools and such. I think that modern times have shown that these stories, once powerful and insightful, have become more run of the mill. You can hear more outrageous ideas coming out of shows like Bill Mahr, and The Daily Show. Though they are still interesting, they are no longer something special."
3,A strange story,"This book was recommended to my 14 year old as reading material from his English teacher. It has some very strange ideas, all related to the era of Stalin and his brutality as he became more warped by his power. The characters are all animals who can talk, think, and accomplish tasks, just as humans do.....most kids may not get the Stalin connection, but the story does cover what coersion, power, and intimidation can be like, even for animals trying to run their own lives and feed themselves."
4,"Great book, but not enough commentary","When I saw that Chris Hitchens wrote the intros to this I was optimistic that he would shed a great amount of light on the subjects. Unfortunately, the intros are too short to get into much depth."
1,Milton The Moron,"The show is mediocre at best. The animation is wooden & tilted. The Milton character is very flat. All he does is eat,be nice and mess up. The others are no better. The stories go nowhere & the jokes are chessy and telegraph a mile away. Ths show attempts dark humor but forgot the humor part thus coming off disturbing. I give this series a 1 out of 10."
4,Milton The Monster Show,This was not quite what I expected as I thought it would be the Milton the Monster Episodes but it is actually Milton and his crew presenting a Cartoon show with shows like Fearless Fly which are good but just not what I expected. The packaging and quality are excellent so if this is what you are looking for then it's great.
5,The perfect toy for cockatiels,"If you have a cockatiel who loves to chew your home apart, this is the perfect toy for you! Each 1"" ball is the perfect size for playing hide and go seek, pulling out of small spaces (my bird loves to pull it out of a 4"" Jack O Latern cup intended for candy), and for throwing around. It's the perfect size for a small to medium sized bird. The vine is very entertaining. My tiels love to chew the plaster off the walls and hate bird toys--but will play with these balls for HOURS. That's never happened with these birds before!Use this ball in interactive games, especially when your cockatiel chews something you don't want chewed, and you will find your bird more interested in the ball than destroying your home!I'm very pleasantly suprised how much my birds love this toy! I am sure yours will too--especially if you have cockatiels! Buy lots of these--they are the perfect toy!"
1,Duets?,"First the popular singer sings, then Pavarotti sings. That's a duet? It didn't work for us. We watched three or four songs and gave it up. Maybe we'll try again, some day."
4,Loving my Pavarotti,"Ever since I received Pavarotti the Duets I continuosly watch it whenever there is nothing else to watch. I love the way Pavarotti's tenor blends in so well with the stars style of singing. My favorites are Annie Lennox (The Eurythmics), Bryan Adams, James Brown, and Ms. Sarajevo with Bono and the master himself Pavarotti.This is a great DVD to play when you have a gathering at home.Those wrapped up in coversation will soon tune in (you just cant help not to) and they will make this DVD the topic of conversation and will want a copy.No regrets here."
5,Enjoyable and unique,"Having lived in Italy for a couple years when younger, I found this DVD so creative as having a surprisingly different slant in music. I like the unexpected in music, and Pavarotti so satisfied my expectations in combining with other popular vocal artists to produce a great music experience. A masterpiece. I don't regret buying this DVD, and Amazon is the best way to purchase it.The Duets [Luciano Pavarotti]"
4,Cute! But...,"This barrette is very cute and it came in lovely packaging. However, I feel that the price is a bit high considering its overall quality."
3,Rip off,When was it that amazon is charging for things that are actually realeased for free by the original cereators on youtube. Assassin's creed: Lineage was originally released by Ubisoft on youtube as a promotion for Assasin's creed II at 1080 p in a series of chapters. Before the game was released 2 years ago.I can't believe this!!!Unless Ubisoft has pulled down the video and offered through amazon this looks like a rip-off.
5,Wonderful 25th Anniversay Recording of Classical Guitarist,"In celebration of Parkening's 25 years of recording, this effort offers forth this digitally mastered recording of his personal favorites. Interesting that his teacher Segovia, acknowledges him as one of the best contemporary guitarists. His delicate, soft and passionate renderings make for great listening and enjoyment, now in a collection. There is wide selection of pieces, with a major concentration of Bach's works, which this reviewer finds delightful and well done, even more so due to the spiritual connection that Parkening and us Christians have in Bach's works! The collection of duos with Brandon is very nice.The clarity and clearness of the recording is amazing."
5,definitely worth buying,"I am not a guitar player, or even a guitar fan. (I suppose too many of them have been electrified and turned into raucous noise-makers.) I was very pleased when this set arrived and I was able to listen to it. Mr. Parkening plays very beautifully -- he makes it sound almost effortless. The variety of music is good, and the insert is full of good info as well. I think this set is definitely worth buying!"
5,The Perfect Introduction to Classical Guitar,"As the other reviews have indicated, this CD offers a great selection of classical guitar pieces from both the spanish and german traditions. Parkening performs them with stunning technique without ever sacrificing warmth. I'd like to add that this CD also has great sound quality when compared to the CD's of other older masters such as Bream or Segovia which sometimes have considerable hiss. So to hear one of the best living classical guitarists with the clarity of more modern recording technology, this is the CD to buy."
4,"A clear,concise outline/""How To"" obtain&retain body wisdom","Phil, the author, outlines exactly what it takes to do, what he calls, ""healing the split"" between body, mind and spirit. I have followed these suggestions, and they really work, if you do them. For those of you who are looking for ways to improve and/or heal your connection with with yourself and others, this is truly a winning way to go. Don't take my word for it. Find out for yourself."
5,"One of my favorite shows, for teens & up","Who would think that a Husband & Wife at the age of 49 would stay up all night long to watchDegrassi: The Next Generation, thats how much we love the show. I will admit, I sure miss Lauren Collins, and find she is missing in a lot of episodes, she plays the perfect little miss priss, which brings that edge and laughter to the show. I started watching the show with my then pre-teenager, now over 18, and stayed a fan. The show is clean, with life experiences teens can learn by and adults can reflect back in school days, going through the same exact issues. Sad to loose JT from the show, his story line could of been written a little longer with maybe him & Liberty smooching again. The new cast is a tad short on excitment, but should draw the attention of the juniors. We must admit, we have a favorite actor on the show, Marco, out heart goes with you sweetie, your the best."
4,Good quality,"good quality but very large file size. Remember, don't delete your Amazon videos that you've paid for, because they'll try to make you pay for them again after you delete them out of the cloud player. Download them to your PC or whatever you're using so they don't screw you."
4,Bach at its best,"The best part of this CD is the Bach recordings. I could listen to the Fugue from Violin Sonata No. 1 over and over without let up--it's astounding. The Chaconne is one of the best recordings of that most exalted work by Bach. The main reason I didn't give this CD a 5-star rating are the non-Bach selections, which although played brilliantly, are not among my favorite compositions. The exceptions are the charming Renaissance pieces for lute and the impressively transcribed and skillfully performed ""Empress of the Pagodas."" To be sure, there are some beautiful and dazzling passages within many of the other pieces, which makes this CD definitely worth it. However, the best Parkening release is ""The Great Recordings,"" which is a double-CD set with a greater variety of music and includes the Fugue and a few other recordings from this CD."
2,Just not what I expected.,This was not what I was looking for. I listed to a little online and thought it was what I wanted but I'm disappointed.
1,A Study in Musical Jargon,"When I saw this book in the store I jumped all over it. ""This should be great"" I thought. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Over half of the pages that my eyes passed over conveyed no meaning to me, semiotic or otherwise. I know one or two big words, but I don't know lots of Eckard's. I wanted to read a music professor's insight into the source of the magic. Instead, I don't even know what I read. Musical meaning and interpretation were elusive. I realize that this book was not written for fans like me. Unless you, too, dwell in Eckard's musical universe, you will probably find this book unfulfilling,"
2,Not what I Expected,Too technical about the music and not enough on the background of the lyrics. Also repeats information in earlier books on Neil Young.
4,"A little dated, but still a wealth of information","I knew that this title was a little older, but I had heard good things about the programs and I was not disappointed."
3,This book was good and bad in different ways,"The good thing about this book was it was scientificaly correct. But the training routines they gave sucked. They didnt follow their own advice. Had they followed their own advice on their training routines, the book would have been flawless. But using the information they give you, you can apply it to make your own training routines. Like i said, its all based on science, to maximize results. Its a good book for football players to read and utilize the info, but dont follow their training programs, use them as a sample to make your own."
2,Needs to Strengthen Itself,"This book was not very well written. I thought that the regimen was way too easy and that the programs moved along at a terribly slow pace. Also, the coaches from Nebraska didn't seem to know what they were talking about. I don't think they are very good coaches."
3,There is more to Jackie than this,"""Chasing the Dragon"" by Jackie Pullinger was the first dawning of the validity of the gift of tongues in my emergent understanding of the Holy Spirit. It was a jolt for me to come slap up against stories that were told without pretense or undue drama. It's a powerful narrative from an icon of mission history. I had seen a DVD on Jackie's ""Walled City"" ministry which I was unable to find but wanted to share with several young women who are, themselves, venturing into service in Asia - so, I purchased this DVD. While this movie may have fulfilled the vision of its producers, I found it disappointing and lack-luster. There is so much more to tell and to show. The interview format simply can't color in the richness of Jackie's contribution to missiology or her raw courage as she faced off the triad gang with tranforming love. If you can find it - go for the other DVD! It seems it may have been called, ""The City of Love"" or something similar."
3,UB40: present arms in dub,"hardcore dub fans may have a hard time taking ub40 seriously, with their heavily commercial sound of the past decade or so. however, when they first started making records, they did their share of more roots-oriented reggae, including some fairly high-quality dub experiments. this recording dates from that era (1981). only 8 cuts makes for a short recording by today's standards, but the low price offsets that. the packaging is minimal, but it's a decent recording. ub40 fans who don't know about the earlier era of recordings may like this, but if they're not schooled in dub, may miss the vocals and commercialism initially. i bet it grows on you, though!"
2,UB40 bombs in Dublin,"Not the best of UB40 quality--overly synthesized and muddy sound from the live performance ruins some of their best political songs. After seeing them live twice, I was definitely disappointed."
5,Relaxing and seductive.,"The music on Toni's 3rd release is just smooth! She has a voice that I think is the female counterpart to Johnny Gill's...it could melt butter in a refrigerator. The first time I listened to this CD I was a little disappointed because it seemed slow, but after a few times in the player, it has grown on me to the point that it's in rotation every day. I have to say that my favorite song is ""I'm Still Breathing"" - the melody is beautiful and no one's voice but smoky Toni's could do it justice. If you listen to this CD and think it's not for you, just give it a chance and I think you'll find that it becomes a favorite."
5,I'm glad Toni is back,"The first single ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" makes me want to dance. I could listen to it over and over. It has a contagious beat to it. The title cut The Heat is also a future dance track hit. Diane Warren has written another great song. ""Spanish Guitar"" is a sexy romantic ballad that reminds me of ""Unbreak my Heart."" The song ""Speaking in Tougues"" is about the power of non verbal communication between lovers. It is a smooth jam that I find very enjoyable. The song ""Just Be a Man About it"" is a lesson for the guys about how to break up with someone. This song has honest direct lyrics any person can relate to. This is a good CD that I highly recommend to R and B fans."
3,This is not her best work,"I'm a little disappointed with this album. I love Toni Braxton's voice, but I don't like her new hip-hop sound. I know that many artists feel that they should change with the times, and I agree, but there's nothing wrong with being original. Toni had originality, but no more.There are some good songs though. I love ""Spanish Guitar,"" the Latin sound is exquisite. I also love ""Fairy Tale"" and ""I'm Still Breathing,"" great tracks. Her alto range sounds as beautiful as always; she has the ability to touch people's hearts with her bluesy voice. There are some nice uptempo tracks on this CD, but the ballads are better.Even though this is not her best effort, it is still worth listening. Toni is worth listening."
4,The Heat Is On,"After the end of a stormy time in Toni Braxton's career, she still showcased that she still had staying power. Her 2000 album, The Heat, tells the story of a woman who faced loss from her man, bankruptcy, and trimuphs over the difficult road to happiness.The songs on The Heat are a bit more edge than Secrets and the Toni Braxton album. Although not as strong as Secrets, the songs have a more modern R&B vibe, with hip hop grooves, and dance mixes. However, there are some simple love songs on the album, like Spanish Guitar and I'm Still Breathing, written by Diane Warren. Also, hip hop songs, He Wasn't Man Enough, written by Rodney Jerkins, and The Art Of Love, pack a dominant punch to cheating men everywhere.The Heat by Toni Braxton, remains a true album of female power. Nonetheless, the music still is strong enough for a man, but has the seductive soul of a woman."
3,too many ballads,"I was expecting more uptempo songs, especially if you call it HEAT. I immediately liked two songs on the album when I first listened to it (He Wasn't Man Enough for Me and Spanish Guitar). The Heat is growing on me. I think she needs to pronounce her words more clearly on the album. Personally, I think the Fairy Tale written by BabyFace is mediocre, definitely not his best work. But I guess that should not be surprising since Toni Braxton sued him. Overall I think that the album is fine. I was just expecting more."
4,Good CD,"This is a really good Toni Braxton album. ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" is one of the best songs she's recorded. Rodney Jerkins produced it (back when he was still hot and made some good music) and it was an instant hit. The rest of the album seemed to fall between the cracks, but THE HEAT is a good CD from Toni. There's lots of good ballads here like ""I'm Still Breathing"", ""Fairytale"" and ""Speaking In Tongues"". There's some nice uptempo stuff like ""Gimme Some"", ""Maybe"", etc. My favorites include ""I'm Still Breathing"", ""Never Just For A Ring"", ""Fairytale"", ""Spanish Guitar"" and ""He Wasn't Man Enough"". A pretty solid effort from Toni Braxton."
4,Heatin up the Radio,"Toni Braxton makes a comeback on this impressive cd. As a young fan and one who never really paid any attention to Toni until now, I was impressed by this disc. Toni starts off with the Darkchild hit HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH FOR ME. The 2nd single JUST BE A MAN ABOUT IT is also a hit and is very strongly R&B. THE HEAT (the 3rd song) is a catch fast song that should've been a single. The ballad SPANISH GUITAR is one of the weakest songs on the CD. Some other strong songs are NEVER JUST FOR A RING, MAYBE and a few others. Toni is still showing them that she can hang with the youngins."
5,Wonderful wonderful,"I am really enjoying this cd since I bought it. It has a great variety of songs, some slow, some with mellow beat and some with a dance beat for really having a party. My favorites are ""The Heat"" and I'm Still Breathing"". Toni still has that nice mellow way of breathing life into a song that I haven't really heard another female artist do yet. She can really sing. Welcome back Toni-I love your new cd girl and I hope you have many more in store for us!"
4,The Heat is On,"Braxton delivers a spicy mix of soul-pop just right for hot summer days. She has grown as a writer, so much so, she does not even need two bland ballads provided by Diane Warren. The title cut, Fairy Tale, and Maybe are awesome stand outs. The heat is on."
4,Glad to see you back,"When I bought this cd, I was immediately impressed with the first single He Wasen't Man Enough that trac is infectus. After listening to the cd some more, I discovered I'm Still Breathing and Never Just For A Ring. Only she could pull off singing ""Why,When,Where,How,Who"" and then end the song with an adlib ""make you go koko"" once you here that you will be hooked! I certantly am."
3,Hot like Fire? Look ahead to check it...,"HWME - ****TH- ***SG - *** (bleh)JBAMAI - ***** (Yah, Toni. Sang it, Honey. Sang it.)GS - ***ISB - **** (Pleasant. So Pleasant.)FT - *** (I don't recall this one. Sorries.)TAOL - **** (Nice instrumental track.)SIT - *** (See FT.)M- **** (Decent, I suppose. :))YBW - *** (See SIT, LOL.)NJFAR - ****Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B-Vocals: BLength: A+Overall: C3.5833333333333335 = 3.63.6 stars."
3,A good solid effort,This is a good cd. The standouts are Man Enough and Spanish Guitar. this cd does not really live up to what potential she has.
1,Can a white people listen to this CD?,"I'm not a racist,but except ""He wasn't man enough"" and ""Spanish Guitar"", I can not listen to any of the other songs.They are really all the same between them. Just listen how the songs start. I find useful this CD only in the nights when I put it in the CD player in order to sleep. And it's a pity because the song ""He wasn't man enough"" is one of my favourites."
4,"I love the new album ""The Heat""","Ok so I've been reading the bad reviews on this album and I just cant agree. I think the album is better in some ways than ""Secrets"" because it has more of a hard edge with the first single ""He wasnt man enough."" But it also has the ballads, the best one I think is ""Spanish Guitar"" and it also has mid tempos such as ""The heat."" I can admit it seems as though the songs werent as well produced as last record. But its a change that isnt half bad and should get some recognition for it. Keep in mind her legal struggle etc and that might be why the album turned out the way it did. Well I love it newayz and you all should check it out!"
2,Heat? You gots to be kiddin'.,"If you love, really, really love Braxton this CD is a prized purchase. I've always been a so-so fan of her music. Here lately she's been coming off as the African American Celine Dion...or is that Deborah Cox? Anyway, I expect stars who carry hype with them to knock me off my feet whenever they release something new. Not so, this, 'The Heat'. If this is heat, then it is most fortunate that most of us do not live in Antartica."
2,Nice,good steady soul. smooth and well sung. but nothing spectacular. her singles are quite nice but I didn't think that they were that great. In the end it seems like Toni gets a bit worse with each album which is disappointing
3,The Heat isn't on,"Toni Braxton has an amazing voice, but this CD does not showcase it. It seemed to me that the backup singers sang more than Toni did. However, almost all of the songs are good to listen to. He Wasn't Man Enough for Me and The Heat are great tracks that you'll be humming to and thinking about when you're not listening to the CD. More of Toni's voice would have made this The Heat better."
4,"Not hot, but definately good!","This is album is certainly not hot- with only 3-4 fast songs. However, the fast paced songs are good, and so are the ballads which take over the album successfuly.Songs like ""He wasn't a man enough for me"" and ""Gimme Some"" with the late Lisa Lopez are bouncy and catchy. Songs like ""Spanish Guitar"" and ""I'm still breathing"" are beautiful ballads, and songs like ""Fairy tale"" will melt your heart , and ""Maybe"" is simply sweet with it's kisses sounds at the first part.Her voice is of coure great, which just makes this album a bigger pleasure.Weak songs however have to be ""the heat"" and ""the art of love"" ."
3,The lukewarm.....,"I just finished reading some of the other reviews, to see if it was just me that was a little down on The Heat. Most love the album, but there are a few that seem to share my opinion, that this is by far not the best work that Toni has done. No one can sing the way she does, but the material she chose for this album with the exception of two or three songs, is very bland and middle of the road. In my opinion, if you are expecting anything close to her debut, or my personal favorite- Secrets, I think you will be disappointed. I remember the first time I listened to Secrets, I LOVED the whole cd instantly! I still listen to it all the time. But I have listened to The Heat many times, hoping it would grow on me or something, and it just hasn't. The only songs I really like are He Wasn't Man Enough, Maybe, and Never Just For A Ring."
3,Toni and her backup singers,"The sharp and melodramatic tunes that she presented in her previous 2 albums are absent in The Heat. It seems like her background vocalists outshine her in the album, especially in the single ""He Wasn't Man Anough"". The chorus, the most catchy part of the song, is sung almost completely by the background vocalists. Vocal appreciators would surely know what I mean. But then, this is one of the better release by a single R&B female artist."
4,This is her best work!,"I really liked Secrets, but this album is amazing! If you don't like it slow and hot, you won't like this album. I don't agree with others who said that this album is ""hip-hop"". It is slow and extremely sensual. It is an awesome romatic evening cd with a touch of nasty (believe me, I put it to the test!). Toni has finally resurfaced with the class that I knew she had all along. This is the kind of music she was born to sing! Her voice is sexual and full of feelings. I didn't really care for ""Fairy Tale"" and the next song after it, as they are more on the ""Unbreak My Heart"" pattern, but ""The Art of Love"", even tho the only thing you hear from Toni is a few whispers, is SO incredible and will make you feel sensual from the inside out! This is a GREAT album, I highly recommend it for that ""get down and dance for your man"" evening that you've been planning for years! It worked for me!"
2,Disappointing Comeback,"I was an avid Braxton fan and couldn't wait for her to come back and sing again. I found this CD rather disappointing, and repetitive. There's potential club music here, and some interesting chances that she's taken, but not the Toni Braxton who sang ""Unbreak My Heart."" The same beat (or so it seems) goes from song to song. Some lyrics are garbled, not like her crystal clarity of before. Maybe it's just me, but I was not too thrilled with this new CD."
2,This is soul?,"Sounding like a somewhat less overwrought Whitney or Celine, Toni Braxton delivers a mildly-interesting 48 minutes of silky pop-funk. The almost-relentless mid-tempo groove,however, soon turns to plodding, and the weak lyrics quickly grate. Only Braxton's vocal performance and the seductive production work move it up a star. Never settle for mediocrity."
2,too much Formula,When Toni Braxton First came out it Looked Like She was Gonna Be a Force.Problem on the First Album is The same with this one&The 2nd disc.Too Much Formula.A Couple Good Uptempo Songs&The Rest is Sappy.Her Music doesn't go with her Image.it Shouldn't take 4 years for this.Dark Child Rodney Jerkins does Her Justice on He Wasn't Man Enough.
1,"No Heat, No Fire","Toni Braxton has her own special brand of schlock R&B, not that it's good, mind you, but it does sound a little different from the undifferentiated legions of wanna be divas out there. It's sort of like slowed down fast music, with crackley vocals. The Spanish guitar in `Spanish Guitar' was good, although the song is marred by the presence of, well, Toni Braxton."
2,TONI'S HEAT IS TOO COLD.,"Toni Braxtons latest effort ""The Heat"" is her weakest album to date.The only standout song is the first single ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" which I think is still a weak song to say the least, from earlier efforts.The rest of the songs are just a mish mash of R & B ""I have heard this before"" ballads, and mid-tempo songs that have no standout potential.Always Braxton is in fine vocal form, but whatever she does she can't turn this piece of coal into a diamond.Unfortunately I think because she lent a writing hand to 75% of this CD, and in my own opinion I don't think Braxton is a songwriter.She should do like Janet Jackson does and have Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam do their job, and if the artist has some input then fine.Braxton is a singer, and what a beautiful voice she has, but she is not a songwriter which drops this album to just a average run of the mill piece of dribble.A disappointment."
2,Toni Toni Toni What happened .......,"I loved Secrets, and her debut album had Breathe Again, and Seven Whole Days, and I know times change, but except for "" He Wasn't man Enough"", which i don't really like ( but it is Toni Braxton .. have you seen the video... AnEway)the other songs are below sub-par, she seems to try and appease everyone... with pop, R&B, and even a pathetic attempt at some raps..Puhhleez ! and that Spanish Guitar Song...... worst lyrics ever ! I am sorry this was a bad Buy !"
5,The Heat is hot like fire....,"I've been wanting Toni's new album for the longest time and finally got a chance to get it last week..I must say that it was one of the best decisions that I have made in a long time..Truthfully, I wasn't that impressed with the first listening but by the second listen i was hooked...Although I skip over Just Be A Man About It and He Wasnt Man Enough For Me (both good songs but they play them too much on the radio), the rest of the album is tight..My favs are the title track, Maybe, Speaking in Tongues, Fairy Tale, and Spanish Guitar..I dont really care for Gimme Some and I cant stand The Art of Love cuz it is a waste of disc space but the other songs make up for it...Im tellin u, u gotta cop this album...Its TIGHT"
2,The Heat is not what it warmed up to be,"The heat is by far not one of Toni Braxton's best album's. I loved Secrets, it is in my CD player 24/7. The Heat just does not compare. It does not have the same heart-felt lyrics as Secrets does. Although, I do love the song ""Spanish Guitar."" It is such a sexy song. I hope that her next album is not such a disapointment."
4,Toni's Back!,"It took a long tome for Toni Braxton to get back into the music secne again. But now that's she's back, she gonna take the world by storm. I recomend buying this c.d, but only if you like Toni's voice, it's very different and low, but if you like that, then go ahead. If you also don't like slow songs then I suggest going after a different c.d. But other than that i's very cool. PEACE:)"
2,"A good album, but not like the previous ones","I love Toni Braxton and I was really looking forward for this album, but to me is not like the previous ones. Some of the songs are good, but I expected more."
3,Something is Lacking,"I adore the voice of Toni Braxton, but the songs that she has selected for The Heat left me a bit chilled. Of course there are a few gems on this CD that will no doubt make it to the top ten and probably carry the CD to platinum status. As far as a good follow up for Secrets, this work is definately lacking."
4,Nice,"This album is great. If you are in to relaxing or slow music, this is good.There are a few song that are fast,like Gimme Some ft. Left eye.This song is like a fast song surrounded by slow ones, but if you haven't had this album added to your cart, you need to pick it up"
3,not all that hot,"i only bought this cd because of her first single, 'wasn't man enough,' thinking that the rest of the cd would follow suit. following along the latest trend, she teamed up with rodney jerkins to create a certified, not too-fast paced hit.but then there's the rest of the cd. don't get me wrong, the songs are good. but the variety isn't there. after getting hyped up by the first track ('wasn't man enough'), the rest of the cd will ease you into a sleep.toni's voice is very sexy and sultry, but the constant barrage of ballads and love songs will lull you into a state of half-awakedness. sure this cd has it's uses--it's a great mood setter. but other than that, get ready for bed when the heat comes on."
3,Disappointing,"After being away for such a long time Toni could have came back with something with a little more to it. That's not to say the album is bad, it's just not great, especially in comparison to her amazing previous album Secrets. The stand out songs are Spanish Guitar, she's really trying to do Un-break My Heart all over again - but it works nonetheless, I'm Still Breathing, He Wasn't Man Enough, Speaking In Tongues & Never Just For A Ring. Make sure you borrow this one before you buy it...it gets very shaky in some areas."
2,Not a good CD!,It sounds like Toni is trying to be something she isn't - too hip hop - not very original - seems to be taking the same course as Whitney Houston - predictable - boring and trying to be hip - bring the old Toni back (without the whinning love songs!)
2,hmmm,"i think this album only goes to show that the days of babyface producin are over , the songs on this album are verry weak u only have to compare the ballads to the ballads on her first album to agree ... he wasnt man enough by jerkins bein the sole excellent exception .. and plz soemone must stop diane warren from writin soem of the worst lyrics ever."
5,GO TONI ITS UR BIRTHDAY.,I REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO THIS CD.(THE HEAT). TONI REALLY CAN SANG AND SHE KNOW JUST WAHT TO SAY. DO UIR THING THATS ALL I CAN SAY.
3,it grows on you,I hated this album when I first played it and I still consider it be a lesser effort but it's grown on me. He Wasn't Man Enough for Me is cute and catchy but why is Toni mumbling? If she had opened her mouth and SANG it would've been great. Spanish Guitar is lovely and I liked Just Be a Man About It but the rest is nothing more than background party music. I play in the car when I'm on long trips. C'mon Toni you can do so much better than that!
5,AN AVID FAN! - Thanks Toni!,"Iam an avid fan of Toni Braxton. I could not wait for her next, newest, cd to come out! I listen to my cd player for up to 5 to 6 hours a day. I liked her album Secrets, but I just love her new cd-The Heat! I haven't stopped listening to it since the day I got it! I was so sad when she left the spotlight, but I'm glad she's back! This cd has a few fast songs, but the slower ballads like #7- Fairytale are the best! My favorites are #1- He Wasn't Man Enough for Me, and #10- Maybe. THIS IS A MUST-HAVE ALBUM! BUY IT!-QUICK YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED! THANKS TONI!"
3,COULD BE BETTER,"I LUV TONI BRAXTON, AND ALL THAT. THIS CD IS OKAY, BUT I WAS EXPECTING BETTER SONGS. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD, IS ""YOU'VE BEEN WRONG"", AND ""I'M STILL BREATHING"". GET THIS CD IF YOUR A BIG TONI BRAXTON FAN, FROM THE START. BUT IF YOUR A NEWCOMER TO TONI'S MUSIC, GET HER OTHER TWO CDS. THEY ARE BETTER."
1,Toni Braxton's WORST work!,"I have been waiting for Toni to come back with a new album, because her last album ''Secrets'' was the best album of 1996. But when I bought this cd today I was so upset because this album had only 3 slow songs, and all the rest of the songs were fast and had no meaning. The slow songs on this album make Toni's voice sound flat and bad, and the fast ones..well, there is to much beat you can't even hear Toni sing. I miss the old Toni Braxton...what happend to her, it seems like Toni wanted to get popular with teenagers on this album bringing in Dr.Dre and Lisa from Tlc..to rap! Please toni RAP music is not your thing, you have always been popular with adult's..but now you have let them down...Toni I wish you luck..but this album was your worst..take some voice training and focus on your ballads...Ballads are what made you!"
1,BAD,"SHE ISN'T A GOOD VOCALIST, THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY, BUY INTO SOMEONE GOOD. I'D RATHER BUY COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC."
2,THE HEAT was luke warm,"Toni Braxton's first single from this release was great. ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" was hot. A dancable beat and creative theme. Not often do you hear the ex-girlfriend warning you about the dog you're currently dating. ""Spanish Guitar"" is pure seduction. ""Be a Man about It."" Could have used more rhythm but what this song really needs is to get rid of the guy who's talking through out the entire song. With the exception of ""Still Breathing"" the rest of the CD wasn't worth a second listen and in parts made the first listen difficult. Her upbeats songs were so watered down that they were hard to distinguish fram the ballads. And she lacks the vocal impact of her first album. Even her heart felt ballads sound more whinny than passionate. My advise, pass on THE HEAT and just wait for the songs to come on the radio."
3,Not Hot Enough For Me,"After hearing the slammin Darkchild produced ""Man Enough for Me"" I JUST KNEW that ""The Heat"" was going to be the best yet from Toni. Unfortunately, that's not the truth. First of all, Toni needs to sing her own background vocals. She is upstaged more than once by her background singers. Second of all the CD is full of recycled hits. ""Spanish Guitar"" sounds like a cross between ""un-Break My Heart"" and a broke-ass ""Killing me Softly""; ""I'm Still Breathing sounds like she tried to make ""I Will Survive"" a ballad, and maybe I'm wrong but I thought Anita Baker sang a much better ""Fairy Tale"". Don't get me wrong; it's not a bad CD. I actually like ""Fairy Tale"", ""The Heat"" will be a summer hit, ""Maybe"" is good, ""The Art of Love"" will have you and your significant other ""Speaking in Tongues"", and ""Never Just for a Ring"" is one of the most sincere songs I've heard in a while. It's just that this CD seems kind of anti-climactic after a 4 year wait."
3,Stuck in the past,"I got the new Toni Braxton CD, and while it's not bad. It's not all that wonderful either. Personally to me it seems everyone is changing their style so that they can get on Rodney Jerkins bandwagon, which Toni did. And second I'm so tired of Diane Warren's sappy love song's. Toni should of let R Kelly hit her up with some more slow jams, he complimented her pretty good on her last CD, she forgot what he did for Maxwell and his hit ""Fortunate"". Try to preview the CD first before you buy it if you are not a big Toni fan."
1,THE BANCRUPCY FAME,I think this album is the bomb. Nobody can sing like Toni Braxton. I think her coming back out of bankrucy and starting with a new cd is more than i can stand. IF any one has some thing to say about my sister i would have to beat them down. NO this this is not Toni's sister ths is her #1 fan
3,Disappointed,"I am a HUGE Toni Braxton fan. I have loved her singing since ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" but this CD has left me unsatisfied and disappointed. I think sometimes the music overpowers her vocals which I don't like because I shouldn't have to strain to hear what she's saying and her ballads were uninspired and boring. I loved her previous two CD's but this one is a letdown. I also looked forward to hearing most of the songs NOT produced by Babyface because his material can become predictable but after hearing the producers she went with, I'd prefer Babyface writing and producing more than than he did. An okay CD but not her best work."
2,Disappointed!,There is no surprise for this new album! The slow ballads are not as good as before! I think she is better to sing something slower! Where have those songs like Un-break my heart gone!
5,Bringing on The Heat,"OK, I've been waiting years for this lady to come out with a new release. I am glad to say that I have not been disappointed. Toni has done it again! I believe this is her best work yet. This CD is HOT and I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,"""The Heat"" is hot!","For everyone that has been waiting for Toni to come back, it has been worth the wait. This CD is fabulous. Of course, ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" is one of the best tracks on the album but there are a lot of great songs (Gimmee Some, ""Left Eye"" raps on that song, The Heat and The Art of Love) She sounds great, if you love Toni---buy this CD, you won't be sorry."
4,She's still breathing,"She may have a couple of bad slips on the album but it's worth it. The definite highlights of the album are I'm still breathing, Fairytale, Spanish guitar, Never just for a ring, Maybe, The Heat, He wasn't man enough and Just be a man about it. The definite lows were The Art of love, Gimme Some, Speaking in Tongues and definitely You've been wrong. On the whole the album was enjoyable although she could have done better by sticking to more of Diane Warren and Babyface's stuff. A bit hurried maybe?"
5,Great to see such a great talent return!,"It is great to see Toni Braxton back after 4 years with her best album yet. Her stunning lyrics and remarkable voice are a great addition to any music fans collection. Song I would recommend are, of course, ""He Wasn't Man Enough"", ""The Heat"" is another great tune, and the song with DR. Dre is off the hook. You should buy this incredible comeback album right now!"
5,Wonderful Illustration of the IWW,"No better way to tell the stories, than in graphic form. The art gives an added oomph to the stories that already have a life of their own."
1,Not ready for Prime Time,"As a historian of the IWW, I bought this title hoping for something new and insightful. While the presentation is new, it really suggests what Henry Adams referred to as the devolution of America. The real IWW did some interesting things with the graphic arts -- none of which are cited or displayed by the author. While portrayed as a serious history, this is truly a comic book posing as history. I would not buy it again/"
1,What were you thinking SEP??,"I have to admit Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my all time favorite author. With that being said, I will NOT recommend this book to anyone. It is almost as if another author wrote the book. It's not a romance. It left you feeling crappy and almost upset. Don't waste your time with this book. Read Ain't She Sweet or Dream A Little Dream, those books won't disappoint you."
4,"Coming of age, but not romance","First off, I'll say this is a good book. It's an interesting story and shows over the course of the novel how one woman matures, grows and finds her own identity through her relationships with three men in silicon valley during the personal computer boom. I don't consider it a romance in my book because the majority of the book focuses on the main character's love, chemistry, and sex scenes with the man she marries and then divorces. That being said, I would have enjoyed it much more if there was more development between her relationships with the other two men, especially the man she finds happily ever after with. It's very predictable in a way SEP's wants it to be, but still manages to be satisfying but not in a swept up sort of way. This is more like Honeymoon than any of her other books which focus on a one to one romance."
4,Hot Shot by Susan Elisabeth Phillips,Excellent romance..great twists and turns! I love when I am surprised with unexpected events. It brought back the Seventies and gave me insight into our technical world's beginnings. I could not put it down! The characters are endearing as well. I give it two thumbs up.
2,Sad,"This book is simply sad. So many bad things happen. Many bad decisions, bad people. Bad events. I want a book that makes me happy, not one that makes me depressed! And I really don't want to learn EVERYTHING there is to know about early computers when I'm reading a romance novel!"
2,It is not what I expect out of SEP,"Honestly speaking, I was disappointed when I read this book. Especially since I really enjoyed SEP's other books like First Lady and Kiss An Angel. Her writing style is definately different with Hot Shot. It is more factual and there wasn't enough humour in it to hold my attention for long. It took me three days to finish the book when I usually can finish SEP's books in one day. That's how boring it was!"
2,Not a must read,"If you love SE Phillips' later works, this is not the book for you. Yes, the information on the birth of the PC was interesting, but the characters were not engrossing. I just didn't like any of them. Too bad."
2,Don't bother,"I hate to contradict the previous reviewers, but I did not find this book half as good as they said it is. And I had to give it up half way through it as a good gesture to myself! I think you've got to be terminally bored to stick to it till the end. The characters are so flimsy, the plot line so unimaginative, it is not worth the while."
3,"Long on Detail, Short on Romance","Hot Shot contains classic SEP scenes, full of snappy dialogue and sizzling tension, but it's short on romance. The heroine and hero appear to be romantically involved almost as an afterthought, as most of the book centers around the birth of the computer. While interesting, the novel reads more like Judith Krantz than SEP through most of it, and the endless inclusion of technical jargon grows tiring by the end of the novel."
2,Not the SEP I'm used to reading,"Hot Shot is an interesting book. However, if you are looking for a funny romantic novel, this isn't it. I would not even categorize Hot Shot as a romance novel. It's a book about a woman's journey to self awareness and self appreciation. The romance is secondary to the story.It's obvious that SEP put a lot of effort into researching the back story, and I really wanted to like this book. However, I thought there were too many characters and side-stories, disrupting the pace of the book. I've read over 10 of SEP's novels and this is the first one I did not really enjoy.With that said, this book is still better than some of the formulaic romance novels out there. I wavered back and forth between giving this book 2 or 3 stars. I gave it 2 stars because I didn't find the story compellinge enough, and it took me awhile to get through the book."
3,"A lot of computer jargon, a lot less romance..","I found this book confusing. Although, SEP tried to speak in layman's terms, I still was completely confused. Maybe I'm an idiot but, I think she went into too much detail on the pioneering age of home computers. However, I did enjoy Susannah's character. You could almost feel what she most have been going through when she jumped on the back of Sam's Harley and didn't look back. Going to an exciting new world yet being scared out of your mind. How terrifying!! She held together w/ dignity and an uncanny spirit that she never let go of. She sure did show them in the end!"
2,Tough Read....Boring!,"After reading most of her books in one night, I forced myself to finish this one, hoping it would pick up. It didn't. I am not a romance book reader by nature, but found her other books hard to resist. I have read all of her books in less than two weeks. I am glad I ended with this one, or else I don't think I would have read the others. Do yourself a favor and pass this one in her collection by...."
3,"Enjoyed it, but not as good as ""It Had to Be You""","Overall, I enjoyed the book. It seemed to drag on at times, but I was satisfied at the ending.I read ""It Had to Be You"" just before I read ""Hot Shot"", and it was much better."
5,Exciting! Fast paced!,"This is definitely my favorite novel by Susan E. Phillips. I finished this book the day after I purchased it, and have read it over and over again. Hopefully she'll come out with a sequel!"
2,Never Ceases to Disappoint,"This product shoots a concentrated stream of steam at a small space. For cleaning tiny crevices or cracks, it works great. However, for anything larger than the tiniest areas, it loses its effectiveness. There are times when I pull it out, fill it with the water and wait for it to pressurize when I have lost patience and used an old toothbrush to clean instead! It comes with attachments to clean glass and even a grill and these are both jokes."
1,The Worst Book Ever Made!,This is a worthless book! Do not get sucked in to buying it! I use it to level a desk in my office. Poorly written! The author is clearly not educated to present (last 20 years) insurance situations. It does provide some insight though.... on what books NOT TO BUY! Gimme my money back!
4,good...,Its a great e.p. Very reminiscant of the Pretenders. This album definetely fits into the post punk category...good stuff.
4,A special soprano.,"Ruth Ann Swenson is a special soprano, easy on the ears, and pleasant to listen to. I do not understand why many reviewers criticize her singing!"
4,a good set,Wham had some good songs together.Careless Whisper was my cut.everything she wants is also a great cut especially the long version.they made happy go lucky music but yet there was something to it as well.i dig this set.George Michael went on to achieve even more.
2,Ridiculous compilation!,"How can a group that only had three albums and not even a dozen hits leave Careless Whisper and A Different Corner off any compilation. I understand that they were released as George Michael singles in their original form but isn't Wham! basically a George Michael showcase anyway. Has anyone purchased any Andrew Ridgely records lately. He was a nice harmony singer & collaborator on a few credits. (including oddly enough ""Careless Whisper."") The other best of, ""Final"" doesn't provide anything that you can't get on Wham! studio albums, but at least it has Wham's best. This one gives you two useless remixes to entice completests, but it's really just a waste of time & money."
3,"Good, but won't hold many cables","Pros:Looks good, easily cuttable for customization. I'll be taking advantage of the paintable option later, but I like that.Cons:Realistically, with good quality cables (which tend to be slightly bigger), this will only hold three cables (and maybe a thin power cord if you can finesse it.) Example: I have no extra room in one with a composite cable, a coax cable and an HDMI cable. Also, once the cover is snapped on securely, I'm not sure it will be very easy/possible to remove it, given the design of the clips."
2,Over Priced,"This wire cover looks good but, way over priced. I returned mine and just put the wires in the wall, cost < $5.00."
2,Jackie Mason in Israel,"I am a true Jackie Mason fan. I have made it a point to see just about every Jackie Mason performance live.I bought the video ""Jackie Mason in Israel"" as one of my husband's birthday gifts. I was excited myself since I hadn't seen it yet.As we watched the first fifteen minutes, we told ourselves that it would get better. Fifteen minutes after that, it still didn't get any better. Of course, since we are fans of Jackie Mason, we can't write that he was terrible, because he never is terrible, or bad, or awful. He just wasn't as funny as he normally is. His jokes were those that made you smile, not those that made you laugh out loud.Nevertheless, I'm still a fan, and I will keep this tape just as I've kept the others."
3,Okay for some mattresses,"We have a pillow top thick mattress that is 12-inches deep. The fitted corners on this product do not fit a thick mattress, so the corners continually ride up. I have ordered straps to hold it in place, hopefully that will help and it will not tear. It is not excessively noisy when you turn over. I am unsure if it would be to hot in the summer, we have a mattress pad on top of it and it seems comfortable for this time of year.Update on 11-26: I purchased a set of BedBand's from Amazon and they work great at keeping the corners from riding up. I feel the manufacture of this mattress cover should make another model for thicker mattresses, a lot of people now days have a pillow top mattress."
1,Not really what I wanted,"I bought this for my toddler to use on his pillow in case there were night time accidents. The material made a lot of noise which he didn't like. Also, it made him get really hot/sweaty. It does not zip closed, it overlaps but this does not work very well. The pillowcase ends up to be only MOSTLY waterproof. I bought a zip close terrycloth cover to replace it and I'm very happy with that."
4,Shower curtain for your pillow,"It is what it is, as long as you expect something which looks, smells, and feels like a soft white shower curtain pillow case with a envelope style close. If you need (close--envelope closes are not water tight) to absolute water protection, this is probably what you need. If you don't need something quite so...dramatic...you should look elsewhere."
2,Hm,"Maybe I'm just of a different generation, but as a bi man, I felt like the author spent a lot of time furthering tired stereotypes about bi people. He was also very strangely conservative ... opposed to gay marriage, seemed to really despise women (or at least have old-fashioned thoughts on them). It's a brave memoir for the time, maybe, but I'm not sure if it's really great for broadening straight people's views on bisexuality."
5,Excellent,"Amiel has again, changed her musical direction, and with These Ties, she is experimenting with folk/indie music. I believe it works. the standout is Expectations, followed by Be Your Girl and stars, but at the moment, I enjoy all of the tracks."
2,Don't waste your money,A few pictures and a few quotes. Thats all there is in this book. Theres nothing in there that we don't already know about Posh spice.
1,superficial,"way superficial, unbelievable, and noticeably fake and nothing but made-up stories to build her image."
3,a cool book really nicely done for an unoffical book,this book is great it could have been a little better in facts.But the pictures are 95% good this book is really for a major Victoria fan. I think the offial books are beeter than these but they are really nice conitering it's unoffcial.
5,A Must-Get For Posh Lovers!,"You'll look cool if you carry this book! Great pictures, quotes, everything and then some! Though Sporty Spice's may have been written better, this is the best of the series. Posh is the greatest! What makes the spice girls so great, is their unique style that spreads feminism. Who has more style than Posh?"
3,This book is so-so!,This book is really only pictures and quotes-I'm sorry! I would reccomend this book to someone who's very BORING!
5,WONDERFUL,"This is a wonderful, minature book. It is filled with tons of interesting facts, great pix and tons more. I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the spice girls!(The posh in my pocket is by far the best in the series)"
4,It gave me as many facts as I would ever need!!!,I really like Posh Spice and that's why I bought this book. Boy was it a great purchase!!! I loved it and I now know as much as I need to know about Victoria Adams.
1,She lied.,I didn't like this book because it was ugly and she lied about her height. It was very boring and Posh was nasty.
5,a record about the second half of your soul,"maybe this is a record for occations when you have been deserted. and maybe it happens a lot. then this record will suit you well. but don't get me wrong, it's not a depressing record. it's about distance and loss, the sadness is in you!"
1,blades make great tool worthless,The multimaster is a great tool concept and very well constructed. The blades are absolutely worthless. A few cuts and they are dull. One cut of any type or size metal and the blade is shot. Unacceptable for over $10 a piece. Go with another brand similar tool with that is available with accessories at any of the home centers at a much lower cost.
1,Do not last long for the $$$!,These blades are good for one use. Considering the price - I find this unreasonable. This should be a six pack for the price.
1,"Terrible, Overprised Blades","The Fein Multimaster is a great product, solid, sturdy, and well engineered. The blades and accessories are absolutely terrible. First off, the blades are extremely thin, if you touch a finish nail with the e-cut blade, consider $25 out the window as the blade is ruined. If you even look at a nail, or use is on hard woods, or cut too fast with one of their wood blades, it will destroy it. For the price of these blades, they should be considerably more durable than they are. I give these blades 1 star as they are overpriced by a wide margin, poorly constructed, proprietary, and limited. Go with a cheap one like Rockwell or Dremell, the parts and blades are cheaper and available everywhere, and it does the same thing as the overpriced Fein."
3,Good but needs replacing to fast and price to high,"Good but needs replacing to fast and price to high. Overall The Power Fien works the best and worth the price - Five Star, they would sell more units if the replace blades were more reasonable."
3,pricey blades,A great tool but the price of the blades is too high. I only hope that the Fein company reads all of the comments about price. Since there are other manufacturers of this type of tool I think that they are going to lose a share of the market. I checked Home Depot and found that they stocked a similar tool made by Bosh
5,Fein Blades,Fein is the best tool ever!! The blades are some what expensive but in the end totally worth it.
2,Blades,I have had little success with these blades and found they are no better than the cheep ones on e-bay. Save your money!
5,multimaster e cut blades,great product but too expensivestill for my money nothing like the multimaster for all your home improvement projects- no other hand held tool I know of can make such precise cutsuniversal blades hold up much better than the wood blades which dull much too quicklysave your cuts for wood though because (even a common nail) metal makes the dull almost immediatelyeven so its the most useful power tool out there and I probably use it just as much as a power drill
3,Nice but tooooo expensive!,"The Fein Multimaster is a great litle tool but it and the replacement blades are way too expensive!! The blades work well for little projects, but they don't last for the long haul."
4,Fein replacement blades,"Great product, way too expensive. Would use tool more if the replacement blade wern't so expensive."
4,Fein Bi Metal blades,The Bi-metal blades are expensive but a better value. Buying in bulk saves $$$.This tool is amazing when you need it. My key to success is not use it unless nothing else will work as well. As blades are pricey but effective
4,Does the job.... But expensive,"I really like - And get a lot of use out of my Fein Multi-tool.But... the blades are expensive.This blade is clearly marked ""Wood"" and ""Metal""...But if you read the tool intruction book/flyer -You'll find out it's only for certain kinds of metal.Nails - Even small nails - Aren't included.I found our the hard way... $50-$60 later.Still... It's a great tool - And this bade is a ""must have"" -Plus a spare."
4,Best price but still too much,This was the best price I could find for these blades but they are still way more than they are worth. Wish someone else would come out with a replacement to create some competition for these folks. I should probably buy stock in their company and get wealthy like them!
4,Best Priced Rip-Off,"The cost of replacement blades for oscillating tools is akin to the ink cartridge scam of ink-jet printers. You have no choice but to pay premium prices or your expensive tool is useless. That being said, these are the best priced blades I could find, so at least I feel I got the best deal while still being scammed."
2,E-CUT on Toilet Flange Bolts,I use my Fein tool a lot but when I used it to trim toilet flange bolts I was disappointed that a brand new blade was shot after one use. That is a pretty expensive cost for a basic operation. Next time I will use my Milwaukee bi-metal demolition saw and blades. They seem to last a long time.
4,What's it Worth!,"The TV ad makes it look simple and the Fein Multi-purpose tool does as promised. This tool is a unique addition to the tool box. The one thing not stated is the cost of the replacement blades and the length of use time. I attached a new blade and tried to cut off a nail that was in concreate in a room I was remolding. Bad choice, in less than a minute all the teeth on the blade were missing and the nail did not have a scratch on it. I checked to make sure the blade was for metal and not wood .... it was the correct blade, stating cutting metal items on the blade. The blade was totally useless, so I figured, I would just buy some replacements. The cost of individual blades is ridiculous as are most of the Fein attachments. This is a great tool, but replacement blades should be much less expensive or be able to last through several jobs."
2,Multimaster Blades,I've had my Multimasterm for six months. I love the tool concept and I have been using it quite a lot for a Kitchen and Bath remodel. My only complaint is that the blades dull very easily and are very expensive to replace. I just purchased another set of e-cut blades and one is already dull after cutting through a couple of nails.
2,Fein Multimaster E-cut 1 3/8 inch sawblade,"I tried my brand new Fein Multimaster just out of the box with the Precision E-cut 1 3/8 inch blade to trim some 5/16 inch bolts. After about a minute of buzzing the bolt and little cutting progress, I discontinued with the Fein as it was clearly dulling my brand new blade. I instead pulled out my trusty Dremel with a cutting disk and quickly completed the cuts. Later, I used the Multimaster with the same E-cut blade to cut some 10p nails and it did okay. Also, I used the Multimaster with a different blade to cut some drywall openings and it did an excellent job. So, bottom line, I am generally happy with the Multimaster tool but not too impressed with the E-cut blade - it clearly isn't up to the task of cutting bolts."
1,Bad for cutting metal,"It says it can cut metals. But after one cutting one thin piece of metal, you are done with this blade."
1,poor quality,"2 out of three of the blades had faulty welds , blade broke off at spot welds seconds after use"
1,Kitchen remodel,"The utility versus cost is not there for these blades. While rated for metal, they are destroyed in one use it they encounter a nail or screw."
2,Universal E-Cut Blades,"These blades are just about worthless at cutting nails. Yes I understand to let the blade do all the work and that the blade is not made as a metal cutting device.after cutting 4 sinkers I had a flat spot in the teeth and had to toss the blade.The blades worked great at cutting everything else, just keep them away from any type of steel"
3,Good all-purpose blade,"These blades work well for both wood and drywall. The main advantage of the E blade is it's ability to work it side to side during a cut. This is a disadvantage when the edge of the blade comes near a surface which you don't want to damage. For those applications, the straight edge blade works better. For the price and durability, I've given it 3 stars. In the past, I re-sharpened the blades using a dremel type tool with a thin abrasive disk. I've now switched to 3rd party bimetal blades which are more forgiving when hitting an occasional nail."
3,Not a good value,Blades are overpriced. But due to the unique interface with the multimaster you have to buy. The multimaster is a good product but the accessories are overpriced. Durability of the blades does not match price.
3,Do not last,The blades cut well at first but begin to dull quickly....they are overpriced for the service you will get.
3,E blade Wear Performance,"I currently use the E blade on many unusual tasks during a Victorian restoration. I'm thankful for the use but at the price of the replacement blades it should be told that these do not wear well. Oak studs, large spike nails or the old antique square nail will wear down the blade fast. Multi tool usage although handy is expensive when replacing blades so often."
3,ALMOST NOT WORTH THE COST,Fein 6-35-02-151-02-0 1-1/8-Inch Universal E-Cut Blade. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT EVERY TIME I BUY THESE BLADES BECAUSE THEY DON'T LAST LONG AT ALL. IN THE TIGHT SPOTS THEY ARE WORTH THE COST BUT MOST OF THE TIME I USE THE SAWZALL.
2,Didn't work either,"I love Andy Griffith, but this one didn't work either. This won't stop me from buying on Amazon though. I just make sure that I am sure of what I am buying now. If we could have seen the picture, it would have been great. I highly recommend anything Andy Griffith to everyone"
5,A story that's hard to put down,"Old legends have their roots in reality. ""Isis: A Tale of the Supernatural"" tells the story of one Iris Catherine Villiers, and how she gained the ability to speak to the dead, an ability that rocks her world and changes the course of her life. Bone chilling and entrancing reading, Douglas Clegg makes quite the adventure that blends fantasy and horror well, making for a story that's hard to put down. ""Isis"" is not a story to be ignored for original fiction fans."
2,Isis,"I was at attention when I first heard about this book. I've read two books about Harrow and its mysteries and loved them. But this one, I was pretty dissapointed. It was too short (I expected it to be longer), the illustrations do give you an idea of the atmosphere, but I was content with making my own fantasy when I read the other two books and the descriptive lines.It is very heartbreaking and compelling and mysterious. I did not know what was going to happen in the end. Those are the pros. But I really expected more. But I do think Douglas Clegg is a phenomenal writer and I have to get the rest of the Harrow series books to keep the mystery going."
4,A touching insight to the life of a young girl with leprosy.,"Mette Newth's words are rich and powerful. He readily indulges the senses. His rich words will make you smile and then cry and then both at the same time! The aura about this book is dark and secretive, but there is also something so light and wieghtless about it. The characters are well developed. Some caring, some devious, some in pain. When this book is read, the pain and suffering in the story is so real, it feels as though you are inside the story along with the characters. There is nothing so satisfying as feeling as though you are able to touch the characters in the story. Just reach out and feel their pain and their sorrows and know what they're thinking. Newth makes you step inside the story and walk among the characters. If you can't comprehend what the life of a leper is like, after you read this book, you might feel like you've been through it all!"
3,"Callas soars, EMI stumbles","As an introduction to Callas, ""La Divina"" provides a fine selection of arias and a generous running time; unfortunately, EMI skimped on some essentials. So we get no texts at all, only a shoddy booklet with an essay that provides only the slimmest details on Callas's life and career."
4,I feel like in heaven!,Outrageous CD! This is the first time i really like opera themes. My favourite song is Siempre Libera from LA TRAVIATA. This is a must buy.
2,Monocorde,"[...]Her voice, tone etc. is exactly the same everywhere, in all records. It's impossible to tell if the underlying extract of the opera (i.e. the story) was supposed to be joyful, sad, pathetic, light, dramatic, with anger etc. Her style is uniform: heavy and dramatic. She does not get into the personality of her characters or at least cannot convey them. Her tone is always a bit too low and almost manly sometimes, the airs stay stuck in her throat, her voice is stuffed.Probably a question of taste, I guess I prefer clean, limpid and cristal clear voices."
3,Not Callas&#65533; best Collection,"Surely Maria Callas is one of the most important sopranos of the past century but this edition does not make one feel the magic of her artistry since it contains Puccini arias in which Callas was, sorry to say this, dreadful! Even her famous Tosca is just a constant theatrical overload of vocal inadequacy not to mention her Mimi in La Boheme. Callas did not posses the vocal warmth so necessary for Puccini Operas. If you want to experience Puccini listen to Renata Tebaldi, the ultimate Puccini singer.However, Callas is S U B L I M E when it comes to Rosina, Norma and wonderful when it comes to Violetta, Gioconda, Carmen. Fortunately this cd contains some of these great moments of her! For me, her best role, in which she is trully unrivalled is Lady Mackbeth, a role she was born to sing (but also not heard on this cd)So why be satisfied with this collection when you can find much better ones with Maria Callas at her finest"
3,Good!,"It is good. I, however, think that this is not better than expected. I purchased this album because of album cover design which deserves applause!"
2,dream world,"The book was dissapointing because the author cant seem to accept the fact that prejudice is natural so he tries to convince us that since there was a time when there was no prejudice, we can get rid of it. The evidence he presents for this view is weak since the illustrations he used only shows caricatures of blacks.Another thing is,he falls into the same old racist definition of the egytians as white when it seems even to a moron that they appear more mulatto than anything else.the only good thing about the book is what i learned about n.african blacks in antiquity.Racism has always been here and will always be here.The aauthor has not convinced me that the ancient greeks or romans had no color prejudice,in fact he has convinced me of just the opposite."

1,cheaply made,"This brand is cheaply made and not at all like the Blitz version I had originally bought. I ordered more to store all my dog supplies and was very disappointed. These are useless unless your only going to store something lightweight like a few towels or something. I ordered a ""Blitz"" brand from Ace Hardware and I so hope it is of the same quality as the ones I ordered in the past. If so, then I will buy more of them...otherwise forget the stacking convenience. It will not store dog food stacked - the bottom bows out and the spots where it is suppose to line up when stacking is a joke. Not worth the money!"
2,Dog Food Storage Disaster,"My 2 weimaraners and 2 labradors discovered they could easily remove the door from the feeder. They all had a feast. They are prone to bloat, and eating mass amounts of food can kill them. I had a lock on the door of the food bin, however the hinges come off very easily for them. This food bin could have been fatal to any or all of the dogs. It looked like a good product, however, if your dog is curious, and a good eater, it could be fatal."
5,Worked great for me,"I used the bins in my horse barn and have been very pleased with their performance. I found that they worked better for me if I put them with the door facing up and I didn't stack them. They can be difficult to fill especially with 50 pounds of feed but with the doors up, they are much easier.. I have owned them for a year and they have held up."
1,Not what I thought...,"The picture clearly shows a two-tier product. What arrived was just one box. However, it is of flimsy construction and I seriously doubt it could withstand stacking. Also, there is no way this thing could hold 100 pounds. I got mine for my dogs, but Ive been slinging feed bags my whole life. You'd be hard pressed to fit one bag of cattle/horse feed."
5,"At Last - a Comprehensive, Beautiful Book about Western ARt","This is a comprehensive, intelligent, beautifully produced work, covering the greatest paintings of Western Art in a way which appeals to the educated art lover as well as the novice. I thoroughly recommend it. One caveat: It's heavy!Carrying it can be a chore. But give it a good home and it will be a perpetual source of pleasure and instruction."
3,Not Commited,"I am not an expert on this piece, but I have fallen in love with it. My father took me to hear it performed when I was a kid and twenty-five years later I bought the Anne-Sophie Mutter recording and have been listening to it almost daily for a month now. I think it's terrific. The Sonnenberg recording is nowhere near as good. I don't know which musician is better, but I can clearly hear who put the most into creating an experience for me, the listener."
4,A One-Hit Wonder...But What A Hit!!!,"If I had to choose between The Essentials and 1993's Let It Rock, I'd have to go with Elektra's 20-track anthology. But with only their debut album still in print, The Essentials is the only way to get the Georgia Satellites killer remake of Joe South's ""Games People Play."" While the Satellites were a one-hit wonder--the terrific ""Keep Your Hands to Yourself""--their Chuck Berry-inspired brand of rock and roll filtered through the Stones and the Faces (check out their version of ""Every Picture Tells a Story"") were one of the bright (if fleeting) moments of the Eighties. If you loved ""Keep Your Hands to Yourself,"" you'll love everything else on this album. RECOMMENDED"
4,It did not prevent Pearl Harbor,"The film is an adventure film in Japan, after the conquest of China by Japan and before Japan launches its attack against the US. Some, in the Japanese military, caressed the idea of conquering the world and for them that implied conquering China first and then the US. This plan did exist of course but its revelation around 1940, a scoop by an America newspaperman of the Tokyo Chronicle caused a severe crisis in Japanese political circles because the surprise effect that was supposed to be essential for the attack on the US was destroyed. The plot is slightly thickened by the use of a Chinese woman as a spy by the Japanese secret police. This Chinese woman had her own objective : blocking Japan in order for China to reconquer its freedom. The film is well done though some details are a little bit sloppy, particularly concerning this Chinese woman who is spied upon by Japanese secret services without her seeming to know. Kind of naive.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Hollywood vs The Kodakan,"This video is a must have item for any long time devotee of the Martial Art of Judo. Not only does it feature Jimmy Cagney in a Dojo during Class, but it also features a ""Judo"" fight in the climactic good vs evil battle at the end.Sure, the fights scenes are a little hokey by today's standards, the Japanese villians are just Americans with bad makeup, and of course the movie is in Black & White, but this movie is now a permanent part of my Hollywood Judo movie collection. Well actually it's my only Hollywood Judo movie."
4,Genuine Cagney,"If you're a Cagney fan (especially a female one) I think you'll love this film. Cagney lays down some classic lines and is invloved in a number of romantic moments which will make the ladies swoon (well, I did anyway). Despite the fact that this is one of his later films, Cagney still bring to the film a certain sexiness and assertiveness that I have come to love him for. Not to mention that he gets to throw a few punches! If you are truly a diehard Cagney fan, this is a must see."
3,"Historically Interesting, Carelessly Presented","These comments apply to the edition released by Artisan in July of 2003. Aurally and visually, this version is relatively clear, particularly when one considers its age. However, there are problems with its presentation.The film is described on its container and on the disc itself as being in black and white. In fact it is colorized, and rather unnaturally so.Special features are promised by the insert, accessible through the MENU button. In fact, there are none.Incidentally, there was a version of this on VHS with a time of 98 minutes; this runs 94.One might hope that Steve Beeks of Artisan will act to insure more care in future offerings."
3,Good Movie,"This is a good movie with James Cagney portraying a correspondent based in Japan during the period before the second World War. He is supported by a very capable cast. As pointed out in other reviews, most of the actors in the Japanese roles were Caucasians heavily made up to look like Orientals including buck teeth. Probably due to the period when the movie was made. Unfortunately, this is a movie that is in the public domain which results in a copy which is less than good. It is watchable, though. I gave it four stars because of the movie itself which I recommend. I lowered it to three stars because of the quality of the DVD."
1,Why Should/Would a CD-R Cost This Much!,"I love Ron Dante and this music, but I'm having a tough time justifying the price (it's even gone up since I first saw this listed on Amazon!) for a recordable CD-R! I've read in numerous trade publications how the data/information stored on recordable CDs has no where near the life of the data pressed/imprinted on a ""silver"" Compact Disc. Why on earth does this cost this much when I can buy a CD-R for less than a dime! This seems excessive even accounting for the artist to make money on his recorded work! As a (former ;-) musician myself I do understand what is fair compensation, but this seems excessive for a temporary recording that may or may not come with artwork and a jewel case!"
3,Lukewarm,"As a fan of Jock Sturges previous works, I found this new collection to be a little disappointing. The mix of innocent eroticism and sterile nudity is disturbing and encouraging at the same time. As in most of his photos, the subjects have been posed by the photographer, but it has never been so obvious as in this new batch. The poses are identical to those in previous collections. While still powerful, these images are not as fresh and the subjects seem to be less spontaneous. They have lost the joy of life and look like they want to be elsewhere."
3,"Perhaps not his best, but top notch quality reproductions","I do not consider this book his best, but the quality of the reproductions are tremendous, matched only by owning an actual print. I actually own 9 B&W prints, 16x20, and the sharpness and use of light is incredible. This book has tremendous quality reproductions, and since they average about 9x12, it is the closest some will ever come to owning a print. There is one print from 1983, so perhaps the title is not completely accurate. This book also has the first color prints I have ever seen, and is a pleasant surprise, since I thought he only did B&W."
3,maybe lost his touch,"I recall that I anticipated this book for a long time and it took a while for me to get it. I am, however a little disappointed--perhaps a little disapointed with life and how a woman fades with age at times. The heart beating leap of some of Jock's other pictures and how the person fades got me a little bummed. Perhaps it is the novelty that has worn off even with this new volume. I was looking forward to seeing how fanny has aged throughout the years and she has lost the vitality that was shown in some of the previous works of jock sturges. Also there was only one picture of Marine and how she has grown (since the Last Day of Summer), and now she looks man-like (and only one picture of her shown in this whole volume).I did give this book 3 stars and feel that it is important to have--being a fan of jock sturges. Perhaps I am ambivalent as it seems that I am writing this."
5,So Much Fun!!!,"We got this for my daughter's first birthday. She absolutely LOVES it! She especially loves the little girl and holds her all day. I do the motions with the music for her and she tries to do them too. She can push all the buttons fine, but does need a little help putting the people in. I think other reviewers have been a little hard on the toy in this area. The purpose is so they learn what shape fits where. I think that was a great idea and with a little patience you can avoid frustration. Overall, a very fun toy!"
2,Very disappointed,"My daughter is 12 months old and the first time she played with the bus she got very frustrated. The problem is...the little people in the bus are difficult to get in and out because the carry handle is in the way. Other than this, the toy had a lot of promise."
3,"fun, but frusturating","My daughters who are 18 months old like this toy for all the fun stuff that it does, plays music..and parts move around etc..but the drawback is the passengers are so hard to get in and they have to be put in the right spot..which is great for an older child, however, my girls always try to match the color instead of the shape and they get so frusturated with it. I wouldn't buy this toy again soley for that reason...It's cute, but not worth the money in my opinion."
2,My son loves to push this toy but its frustrating!,"Very frustrating because it is hard to get the little people under the rail to set into the shapes they are suppossed to sit in. Therefore it frustrates my son, heck it frustrates me!"
1,Wrong item sent,"I ordered this disc because I particularly wanted the Havanaise number. I was sent a disc that had 2 Paganini violin concertos on it and no Havanaise and was not by violinist Sarah Chang. When I questioned this, they could not find my Amazon order number; said I had given them a wrong order number (which I had not). In the end, they gave me a complete refund, and did not ask for their mistake back. So that part ended well, but I still do not have the piece of music I wanted...so I will need to pursue another merchant."
3,Sarah Chang Plays Like a Conservatory Student,"Yes, yes, I know she has great technique. But technique only serves to emphasize musicianship in a player, a quality that she is shockingly without in the Paganini concerto. This is a wonderful piece, it's like the Italian version to Arthur Sullivan's scores for the G&S operette, it's rollicking good fun. It's a humorous, passionate piece that can't be taken completely seriously. But Sarah Chang misses that point. She doesn't understand what this piece is about the way that Pearlman does. But she plays it like Mozart! It's all wrong! Absolutely wrong! I just listen to this thing and think about how stunning wrong it is! The bowing is much too light and serious; she needs to get into the string and bring out the passion, but more importantly, the great *wit* of the composition! Sarah Chang has no idea how cute and fun this concerto is!"
4,"Good earphones, good comfort","I like these headphones, but am not as overwhelmed as I was expecting to be based on the reviews I read. These phones deliver clear music, and the comfort is better than most others I've used (the Sony over the head inside ear phones I had before that came with a Walkman were the best). I guess I was hoping for sound quality to be as good as an over the ear phone but it's not.If you're looking for comfort, something to use on the go, these are great. If you're looking to reproduce a cinema experience then you should go for a quality headphone that covers your ear."
4,Fsu helmet,I ordered the helmet as a Christmas gift for a friend and was very pleased with the item it was of good quality and appeared as it was listed on the website. The delivery was timely and accurate. I would not hesitate to once again order from amazon.
4,huge Michiagan fan,"We bought this helmet for our 29 yr.old son who is a huge michigan fan. He absulutely loved it. The price was much lower thru this site rather than other sites. The only complaint was that it was a little smaller then we thought. He can bearly get it on, and he only weighs 150 lbs. Now we need to get him a glass case to show it off!"
2,Some Missing Bits...,"I think the first compilation (Decade Of...) was better overall, despite the unnecessary extra language versions (three for Dumoutier!). Where is ""Live on T.V."", ""To What We Shall Believe"" and, a minor but personal fave, ""I'm Back""? The ""Decade"" comp. wasn't that satisfactory either (containing both ""Just For Laughs"" and the equally leaden French version ""Juste Pour Rire"") but at least it had ""Live..."", one of the most evocative Box songs ever. Check out your local used cd place for the twofer""The Box/All The Time, All The Time, All The Time"" cd; if not (it's pretty rare), Box tapes are not uncommon. In my opinion,""All The Time..."" is a classic (All Music Guide gives it 4.5/5) and worth the extra expense."
2,Nostalgia was better than this album...,"The songs sounded better in my memory than the actual tracks on this album. I don't have the ""original"" recordings, so I'm not in a position to comment on those, but this compilation sounds like they hooked up a mic in front of a home hi-fi system to record it. The production values and sound levels are poor. Oh, and the first (or zeroeth) track wouldn't play on either my car player and wasn't detected at all by WMP. You would think that the producers would have taken advantage of the opportunity to polish things up a bit before releasing this dog..."
5,Amazing band!,"The voice of Jean-Marc Pisapia is amazing. I wish this band was still around and Jean-Marc was still belting out tunes. I have all their albums, all of which are worth owning. Every track is fantastic. You won't be disapoointed by this album if you like rock with a bit of 80s synth."
1,Knorr Garlic mini cubes first ingredient is salt and then MSG,"Monosodium glutamate (MSG) can trigger headaches and other symptoms in some people.Aw...then we get some garlic powder among other fillers after salt and MSG. There are much better, both convenient and healthy spices and herbs combinations (real food) to choose. Check out Frontier's line - inexpensive, many are organic and ingredients include the spice or herb itself or some tasty combination. There's a new line (to me) I have not tried, but prices are low and product is organic - Red Monkey."
1,Awful,Unbelievably bad typos...So bad that the reader cannot even decode and maybe go on to reading...Such a disappointment it was....
3,Eyeopener!,"It really is interesting to learn how eye doctors trick the publis, this book shows how you can beat them!"
4,Good reading.,"I wish my parent read this book, before I had my first convetional eye exam. It would saved me alot of money and name calling. Parents, read this book and try to avoid glasses for your kids, it just going to make 0their eyesight worse."
5,Excellent Eye-opener!,I think this is a great book. I know of many people who have actualy tried the methods described in the book with amazing results. All it requires is a little patience and perseverance. A couple of simple exercises everyday and you are on your way to better eyesight without glases. Eyes like other organs in the body can be healed by proper care and exercising the muscles. Try it !!
4,Life with out glasses,Excellent book with some useful exercises and clear explanations but didn't come with the promised eye chart. The lack of eye chart made much of the content difficult to test so I'm still wearing glasses.
2,Missing the eye exercise Chart!!!,"I heard about this book from Dr. Mercola, so I was excited to learn, but the eye exercise chart that claims to be at the back of the book ...it is not! I gave 2 stars because it is informative."
3,Expected more,"I was fascinated when I heard about this method. It seemed such a beautiful thing to naturally get back perfect eye sight. This will only work for people that are just starting to realize that their sight is becoming worse - if you've already worn contacts or glasses for a while this will be tough. It requires you to throw out your glasses/contacts and do exercises on a daily basis. I brought this up when I went to my eye doctor and he mentioned that he's considered quite laughable in today's circles. His method is also a lot about fragmentation as opposed to seeing more clearly. It is complicated after all. I did expect much more from this book, but I assume there is a reason that this method isn't famous today. Today's society won't work with this."
4,My experiences of the method,"This method works but it needs a lot of commitment. If you are able to throw away your lenses and keep to a program which requires an hour out of every day then go for it. However, if you need to wear your specs every day just to function - for driving, computer work etc - then you needn't waste your cash. This won't work for you. I once had a period in my life during which I didn't need to have my glasses on and I was able to practise every day. I gained such an improvement in my prescription that - when I returned to the eye-doctor - I was for the first time qualified to drive without glasses, and, though my eyesight is still not perfect, I have never worn spectacles since.Expect immediate effects, which might seem quite dramatic. After that progress is slower. The four stars I gave this book is because it is the original. There are, however, better expositions of the method on the market."
4,Lacks clear prescription,"This is a very interesting book, it explains a lot of things related to the eyesight, but lacks clear prescriptions for the reader how to apply his method on practice. There are no easily heard or seen descriptions of the exercises that the individual should perform to improve the function of eye.Nevertheless the book is incomplete perplexing a little bit, it has enough liveliness, humor, and variety.If you are about to improve your eyesight, I would have recommended to read this book first to understand the framework, and then proceed to another books which are based on the Bates method but have sound explanations of what actually the patient have to do, e.g. ""The natural way to better eyesight"" by J.I. Rodale, ""Conscious Seeing"" by R. Kaplan, ""How to improve your eyes"" by M. D., Corbett, ""Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses"" by S. M. Beresford, and so forth."
3,Decent Book...,"I bought this book thinking it would help me get rid of my glasses. Well, I don't want to make it sound like I'm really slamming this book, it really was a great book. Dr. Bates really was a revolutionary opthamolagist, however this book didn't go about explaining how to go about doing some of these ""exercises"", or not as much as I'd have liked it to. This book, however did explain the eyes and why the eyes go bad, and it all makes sense if you keep an open mind about it. If you really feel like curing your eye problems, you may want to look elsewhere, though this book is a good starting point. All in all, this book was a good weekend reader, and it did make some good points, but if you bought another book on the Bates Method, you might be more pleased."
1,Don't buy this book- it doesn't help,"This book doesn't help you at all if you want to improve your vision. It is quite an interesting read, but it doesn't really tell you what to do to improve your vision, apart from gaze at the sun and stare at the enclosed eyechart. I would recommend a book called something like ""Improve your vision without glasses or contact lenses"" as it is much better."
1,Beyonce? Could she be any more airbrushed?,"I love this magazine and I would never buy this one with Beyonce on the cover. She does not deserve this cover and it certainly is not her REAL body on it. It is so airbushed it isn't even funny. I bet she paid them to be on the cover. She is probably getting so tired of all of the attention Jennifer Hudson has been getting for Dreamgirls. J. Hudson just graced the covers of Vogue and it was HUGE news. Not even a week later, Beyonce tries to show her up. Such a joke. The excerpts I have seen of her swimsuits are also horrendous. Skip this issue!"
4,smokin issue,"the girls and beyonce were hot,hot,hot.but only 4stars no 3-d beyonce pictures that would be 5-stars.maybe next time."
4,The real deal finally,"After not being able to purchase SI locally here in OZ, it was great to be able to recieve a copy of latest SI - rather than rely on the occaisional pic from the 'net.... As expected this issue was excellent - world locations and brilliant models - and the 3D pics were novel.... and the linking with music via the SI website was excellent !if u love SI - do also find yourself a copy of the DVD's as u get to see the girls 'in real life' behind the scenes.... it brings so much more to reading the Magazine...Well done SI !"
4,Fun Read for those who want to know what the Wild West was really like,"I must open by saying that part of my interest in this book is that I am a descendant of the author. I still have family in New Mexico and therefore it is easy for me to connect with the author.Having said that, this book is just a fun read if you are interested in the culture of the American west in the late 19th century. The author is not really a writer, and it shows in the way he writes, but if you imagine an old man sitting on a porch spinning tales about arresting the man who shot Billy the Kid or how he and his family were trapped inside their cabin for several days by Indians, it becomes a relaxing and fascinating read that offers real insight that is lacking in movies and documentaries.This is unfiltered, unproduced history and it is worth the read. And no... I do NOT get residuals on this book!"
5,rich looking,"very rarely buy sight unseen but when i saw this in my house with my 46"" Samsung LCD. everyone agreed that it was rich looking. very pleased with Tech Craft and Amazon."
4,TRK50B,"+ Easy to assemble+ Space for receiver + Blu-ray player on bottom and center channel on top+ Well-builtThe mount on the stand is tilted upwards a few degrees so the TV is not perpendicular to the ground. Consequently, the screen has a very slight pentagon shape from the perspective of my sofa. It's not really a big deal. I ordered the stand a year ago and haven't been annoyed enough to fix it. Now that I'm moving I will give the manufacturer a call."
2,Avoid AAA Home Furniture Discounts!,"AAA Home Furniture Discounts lacks integrity should be avoided at all costs. I have dealt with hundreds of Sellers in the Amazon Marketplace and AAA Home Furniture Discounts is by far the worst. They misrepresented the product and refused to replace damaged parts, then taunted me and said they would win against any claim I might file. They were completely unprofessional and never even sent an order acknowledgment or shipping notice. DO NOT REINFORCE THIS BEHAVIOR!"
1,The worst customer service,"While the quality of the item seems above the norm, customer service from this company is dreadful. My new equipment sat around in boxes waiting for a replacement for a damaged shelf that was delayed, then delayed again, by mix-ups on the company's part. Their refusal to budge an inch from their standard process, even though it meant further delay for a very unhappy consumer who had gotten tired of run-arounds and excuses, is a far cry from the real customer service I've experienced elsewhere. I will never buy another TechCraft item."
4,Good product,"Good, solid product. As advertised. Actually haven't mounted my tv on the bracket yet, but my Samsung LN52A650 fits nicely on the top glass shelf.Assembly is a bit tricky with one person, but do-able."
4,"Good book, but this is a collection of stories, not just one novel","I greatly enjoyed the story ""I Am Legend"", but was quite dismayed to find that it ends halfway through the book and the remainder is short stories. There's no indication on the listing that this is a book of short stories."
3,"oh, these ""classics""","a good book. no, nothing more. perhaps even a bit worse. a plague makes everyone either dead or vampires. except one. who tries to survive. who tries to kill vampires. he locks himself up safe and sound in his house. this is actually the great thing in the book. the descriptions of the way the guy stands there watching the vampires trying to lure him out or attack the house. very W.H.Hodgson- like. but except for that. i mean, why bother killing the vampires if you're the only one left? and how important are we supposed to feel his survival is, when he's the only human left. he lives, he dies. mankind's done for either way. survival isn't even important for him, since he feels lonely, scared, etc. let him die, i say. who cares when it doesn't make a difference? this is actually more a story about loneliness than a horror novel to me."
4,Better than the Movie!,I choose this book due to watching the movie. This book goes much deeper into how the disease took off and how the main character goes about its discovery. The is a great psychological view on the main character and how he maintains his sanity through the end of days and absence of human contact.
2,Disappointed after reading the reviews,"I expected more out of this book after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It does introduce some interesting ideas regarding human-vampire relationships, but ultimately it wasn't enough for me. Also, the main character was hard for me to relate with and Matheson's writing style wasn't my favorite.Amazon consensus says I'm an outlier. It's not that expensive, so if you decide to buy it I hope you like it.Lastly, be aware that only half the book is ""I Am Legend"". The rest is a series of short stories (also by Matheson)."
4,Omega Man this is not.,This is the first Matheson book I`ve read. Nothing like the films I`ve seen based on it. Good read. Short but sweet.
4,Original piece,"Descriptively paints the picture for an apocalyptic world. I don't want to give away anything from the book, so I highly recommend to anyone interested in an end of days crisis or survival in general. The story is far more about the protagonist, Robert Neville`s ability to survive on an emotional and mental level than that of a physical (food, supplies, etc.) one. I related to the story because when I think about surviving in this type of situation many of the same ideas play into my head like that of the writer."
5,Great read,A page turner in every regard! very interesting to see a man survive the unknown. A must read for any horror fan
4,I Am Legend Review,"First of all, I am so glad that the book was completely different from the movie. Hollywood caters their visual stories to what they think will sell, and that is understandable. It is a story that is short but compelling in that it has a unique take on the ""post-appocolyptic, zombie"" theme, and does an awesome job at convincing the reader just how alone this type of existince could be."
5,"Think of the movie ""Blade"" starring Wesley Snipes.","One of the best screenplays and potential movie classic, it still hasn't been made yet!!! What's the delay? budget.that's how i came to reading this book. it's WICKED awesome. the visuals and the action just keeps on pumping, i never really thought that books could really be so action packed as an action flick but here it is. Just the title alone is action packed. ""I AM LEGEND!!!!"".if you play computer games this is like Duke Nukem crossed with Doom and Nocturne.and if you saw Blade and you liked it, take that and multiply by 100 and you'll have I AM LEGEND!"
3,Really old book,"Enjoyable but this is the very old original story without any modern day references. In addition, the primary story is only half of the book, the rest is made up of short stories. I was disappointed because the hype suggested a rewrite."
3,Not the Movie,"The Movie was great and the book was very good, but they are not the same. Rather misleading to use Will Smith on the cover. The protagonist in the book shares little in common with the one in the movie and the story line is vaguely the same subject. If you are looking for the written equivilant of the movie you will be disappointed. But it is a good story on it's own.Most of the short stories after the main feature are rather week and at times confusing. At times they felt like ""filler"" to make the book big enough."
2,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"I hate to go against the grain here but I found this book to be mediocre at best.It started out decent and I especially like the attitude of the main character, but the ending was a huge disappointment. I believe it could have had a much better ending in keeping with the general tone of the rest of the book.The last half of the book had me confused until I figured out that it had nothing to do with the first part. As I haven't read any other books by this author, I thought maybe my copy was a misprint.If I had it to do again, I wouldn't wast my money. My advice is to save the money on the book and if you just have to know the story, go see the movie."
3,Good book - yes. Scary - Not at all,"If you're looking for a book that will make you jump at odd noises you hear while reading it or make your mind wander to the shadows at night (is something there?)...this book will not do that (try reading Hell House by Masterson instead).However, it is an interesting read. The story kind of reminds me of the story premise of the comic book 'Blade', except that the main character is not half-vampire, but a vampire killer nonetheless.It's a short read and the ending is worth the hour or so read."
3,Very Weird,"Quite slow, with pretty much just one man left, all the book talks about is him. There is only so much to TELL."
2,Are these people crazy?!,"I'm not kidding, I truly think these people are crazy. I've just seen review after review describing how scary and suspenseful this book is. What a joke! It reads like a documentary that doesn't really go anywhere. I thought the book was very interesting. And if you want to someday write a horror book, maybe this book can give you some ideas. But it's not suspenseful and, now don't all start screaming at once, it's kinda boring. Sorry. But you start it, you read it, and it's over. No real ups or downs. And the ending: I guess it was supposed to be a big deal, but all I could think was, ""Who cares?"""
1,Not very good!,"This book really showed very little imagination. Having seen the movie I really expected more. ""Hats off"" to whoeverhad the vision to adapt this to the screen. There were very few surprises and too many contradictions. Having been a long time fan of the genre I know that you can't over think, but even the basic suppositions of this book had gapingholes in it. I personally need someone to root, for or at least identify with and from the beginning I didn't carewhether the main character lived or died. It was a complete waste of time but having invested in the book I completed the transaction but should not have thrown good time after bad money!"
3,Definately not worth full price...,"I purchased this book on sale...Thank God! I have plans to see ""I Am Legend"" once released on DVD. I decided to read the book before the movie (I enjoy seeing the differences between the book and movie). Half way through the book , the outcome for the main character became evident, and it was a logical conclusion. The book continued on, and so did I. I hoped that there would be some logical explanation for what followed. I tried to force my own explanation into the book to make sense of it all. It just never happened. I gave this book three stars because the beginning of the book is quite good. The second half, however, is horrible."
2,$14 for a short story,"$14 for a short story. Too much. I didn't realize until i purchased the book that the book contains several short stories, one of which is I am legend. Cashing in on the impending film?"
3,Really a collection of stories,"Wanted to read this and see how it compared to the movies. Really this is the I am Legend tale and then a collection of the author's other works as well, which I have yet to read.Overall, it was a little too much 60's theory that man is controlled by his urges not his mind for my taste but it was nice to see the payoff at the end to understand what the author really wanted the title to be."
3,A Taut Latter-day Vampire Thriller,"Richard Matheson has crafted a clever (relatively) modern-day tale of the undead. I have not yet seen the recent DVD movie which was based on the book, but I suspect there are many dissimilarities.Caveat for those picking up the paperback version -- be aware that much of the book consists of unrelated short stones by Matheson. This is not made clear to readers or buyers of the book up front, which can be confusing when you transition from ""I Am Legend"" to ""Buried Talents."""
4,Dark and Awesome,"A classic horror novel. I borrowed this book and I am very happy I read it. It is a dark, edgy and gripping story of a man left 'alone' in a world inhabited by zombies who want to kill him. Great depth of charter and a fast paced story makes this book hard to put down."
4,Very pleased over here.,Like many I saw the hollywood movie first before I even knew about the novel. As a an avid reader I know that the novel is often much better than the movie version. That was certainly the case with I Am Legend! I think that the movie would have been ten times better if they had not have strayed from the original premise of the novel. My only complaint was that the novel was so short.
4,Will Smith is no Robert Neville!!!,"Unfortunately, I did not know there was even a short story called I Am Legend before I saw the movie. I thought the movie was so-so, but now that I have read Matheson's awesome story, I hate the movie for not staying true to the book and missing the mark. Shame on you, Hollywood. This story is intense, gripping, and unique. The main character, Robert Neville, is a likable character who I became invested in quickly. My only semi-complaint is that the scientific talk went over my head, but I didn't feel like it made me appreciate the story less. I love Matheson's take on the vampires and the imagine of ""Neville, come out!"" was absolutely haunting. It had good twists and I loved the ending. It seems like in today's society every vampire story(or scary movie)is pretty much all the same. Originality is hard to come by these days. It's interesting that a story written in the 50's is more fresh and solid that anything I've read (or seen) in quite awhile. Bravo Matheson!"
5,Great story!,"Cheap book and a quick read. The story is quite different from the movie, and I think I like the book better. I'm a science nerd, and I love how they talk about a potential scientific mechanism for the transformation of the human race (trying hard not to give away any spoilers). There are some more short stories at the end I haven't checked out yet, but I""m sure they will be great."
5,"Haven't seen the movie, but I know the book is better.","I decided to read the book after an online acquaintance told me about it. It's a really excellent read, with biology added in for effect. The reader follows the Robert Neville's psychological torment from being the last human alive. The book cannot be put down until the final scene. And even then the final scene must be read twice. The effect is that good. And it's nice to read a story about vampires that's not a pretty, rainbow and butterflies love story ;)"
5,Awesome but annoyingly deceiving.,"I am Legend is really really good. But nowhere on the outside of the book, or the inside even, does it state ""Collection of short stories."" I liked the ending, but it would've been a lot more satisfiying if I knew the end was coming. Instead I was getting to the end of I am Legend wondering ""Wow, how is he going to get out ot this situation... theres a little less then half a book left!"" I skimmed ahead and looked for his name. Never seeing it I went online and found out what this book really was.I am Legend is a really good short novel... but in future reprintings they need to be more clear that this is a collection of short stories."
5,Amazing!,"This book/short story, what ever you want to call it... is absolutely amazing! An instant classic. If you dont buy it, you are seriously missing out. It's a little short -- but VERY sweet! If there are any bad reviews of this book it's one of the two reasons... They didn't understand it. Or they didn't read it!!!!But trust me, it's not complicated. It's just a great story with an amazing ending. What ever you do, DO NOT READ the last page until you actually get to it... Trust me... it's a mind job. This is the only book i've ever read where the last line has so much impact on the entire story.... When you read this you will see what I mean!!!"
5,Great Story,"I didn't know this story existed until after the movie a friend of mine told me he had read it and wanted to see how they adapted parts to the movie. And after reading it, I can attest that it was close to the story. I can tell what was going through the character's head while he's alone, which is one thing that I like more about books than movies. All in all, the movie was very close to the original story. The book also come with a number of other stories, too."
4,Look forward to the movie!,"Wow, I didn't realize how long ago this book was written! I cannot wait to see the movie! I have to say, I am a vampire book hater. I just don't get into them. I wanted to read this before the movie (because the movie caught my eye!) I picked this up and THEN realized it was about vampires...I was skeptical to even try reading it. However, the book was actually pretty interesting! It is mainly a man's struggle with vampires, when he fears he's the only man left! How crazy difficult would that be? We find out, his daily lifes struggles in ""vampire dealings"" and what is going through his mind as he tackles these unfavorable problems. I actually enjoyed this short story and look forward to see where the movie takes this. I can't say that I read ALL the other short stories in the book, but I AM LEGEND was worth it!"
5,Great Read!,I can't believe it took me this long to pick up this book and read it considering I'm such a fan of the genre. It was very well done. I enjoyed every story in the book!
4,Not a Horror Masterpiece,"The story flows well. Not very scary. The vampires are certainly not Anne Rice's, beautiful and intelligent immortals. These vampires are diminished and painfully stupid. However it is worth the buy and holds interest. The last human on an earth overrun with vampires, it sucks you in . A great weekend read."
3,ehh its okay,It was an okay book although I found it a bit boring at times and the ending could have been better.
3,3 and a half,"I enjoyed this book. I love the Will Smith movie, but this book is very different. More like the Vincent Price movie, ""The Last Man on Earth"", but this book has a better ending. I did not read any of the short stories at the end."
3,sick ending,"This book was short and interesting, but the ending left me hanging. It reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock."
3,"Be warned, this is a novella, at best.","The original book is only 122 pages. Don't be fooled into thinking you are purchasing a full length novel here, it has been puffed up to fill 300+ pages using the same text."
4,A Page Turner,"For a book written in the mid-fifties, it reads like it could have happened yesterday. The book seems like a great study in 3rd person limited and hits on every kind of emotional high and low a man who is alone would probably experience. The fights scenes between him and the vampires were absolutely awesome and it felt like I was right there along with Robert Neville (the protagonist) kneeing a vampire in the face, hitting them with his car as he scurried back to the house, or shooting them in the face. Matheson has a great use of realism and while the book has some really cliche events (that I won't go into here), they still all work. In the end, you're sort of floored from the powerful combination of good writing and imagination. If you want a book that pretty much haunts you even after you have read it, then check this book out. It's worth it. And oldie but goodie that delivers."
4,Good stories,"As expected, ""I Am Legend"" was not like the movie. It was a little confusing (living vampires? dead vampires?), but was still thought-provoking. The other short stories in the volume were a little dated, but still good stories."
4,Full of Extra's,Awesome read that kept me curious throughout. I was surprised that the book also contains a collection of around 10 novella/short stories by the author after the main book. A Dark story that will stick with you.
3,"Good, interesting, but not enough...","Sure, I will admit that I Am Legend was one of the better vampire stories I've read, but something was missing. I suppose I could say I'm among the readers who thought it was too short. When I picked up this book, I guess I was in a hurry or I overlooked something, but I didnt realize that I Am Legend is really just a short story among others in this book. And though the other stories are great, I only picked up this book for I Am Legend. Good story, interesting premise, but still it was over too fast. Maybe I'm speaking too soon, but the movie looks to be one of the few movies to surpass thier book counterparts.But we'll see."
5,Epic Horror,"It inspired NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It changed the way we see vampires (no longer counts in castles), and practically invented zombies (no longer voodoo victims). It even made a young Stephen King pick up a pencil and begin scrawling out horror stories.I AM LEGEND is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and important horror tales ever woven. Like Stoker, Poe, Bierce, Shelley, Lovecraft and Stevenson, Matheson's work is mandatory reading for any true fan of dark literature. No movie could ever (despite two attempts so far) capture the brillant terror of this book, and no other books by Matheson, although all of them are excellent (Hell House, 7 Steps to Midnight, ect.), are as good as this one. It is more then worth the money, for it is a book you will read more then twice!If you enjoy King, Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, William Peter Blatty or Ramsey Campbell, you will shriek for Matheson,... and vice versa."
5,Whoa,"i found this old weird looking 1950's paperback of my dad's and read it, it was getting on in the day, and reading this book as the sunset neared, i grew very edgy. i was alone in my sister's apartment reading about this unbelievable world and setting. i just can't believe how mattheson can write cliffhangers, my favorite part was him describing the protanganist's favorite hobby was looking for his undead neighbor to kill him. also amazing when the protaganist was experimenting with killing the undead and he realizes his watch had stopped.... jesus just the best. my commentary doesn't do it justice, but he painted a mood so hopeless and dreary..... i will leave it at that."
2,"Starts out well, but fades, and drops away.","I purchased this book/short story in anticipation of the upcoming Movie. Generally i like to read the book first, because most of the time, they are different, and the book is usually far better.This remains to be seen in this case. I cannot recommend this book, it starts out good, and it feels like it will build to a natural climax, but it does not, it kinda just fades away, and ends.I really hope the movie isn't the same. I paid $14 for this, and i'm disappointed. 170 pages is the short story, then the rest of the 300 and something pages is alternate stories. Don't be fooled at the size of the book itself! Off to ebay!"
3,different than the movie,This book was good and I really enjoyed it. The movie was so different but it was good just the same.
5,Unbelievable,"This book is not at all like the movie that was released with Will Smith. It instantly pulls you in, alternating between the struggles Neville must face psychologically as well as physically it goes deeper into the Horror genre than just running scarred. He has to accept who he must become in order to live in this bleak new future. New plot elements are introduced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat, hopeing and praying that Robert Neville will find the peace he needs to somehow be happy again. In the end, I was completely surprised by what happened.This book is a whole new adventure from the movie and is far better in my opinion. It is not very long and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely a fan of psychological fiction, horror, zombies, vampires, post-apocalyptic future, etc.."
3,"Classic, but overrated","Good story, but the style was quite dry. Certainly creative but lacked a spark to make it completely entertaining. The investment in the story you make as the reader is never paid off by Matheson. It's like reading the newspaper; sometimes riveting, usually mildly interesting, but rarely entertaining. One other HUGE point I'd like to make that seems neglected by all other descriptions and reviews of this book. Only two-thirds of this book's length are taken up by ""I Am Legend"", the rest is a bunch of short stories, which aren't very good either in my humble opinion. I wish someone had told _me_ that before I bought it."
4,"Needed to read to compare to the movie ""The Omega Man""",The movie was much better. I have completed the comparison. So that can be marked off the list! Two words.
5,old books are the best ones!,"I really loved the movie with Will Smith, but this book (as all books usually do) blew it away! i loved the twists and each step Robert took especially psychologically."
4,Excellent SHORT Story,"Having seen the Heston and Smith movies based on this story, I wanted to back to the beginning and read the genesis. The original story stands on its own, and is virtually completely different from either movie. The only complaint I have is that the book should have been advertised as a compendium of short stories with ""I Am Legend"" as the lead."
4,Now I Know Why it's a Classic,"I decided to read this book because it's a classic in the genre, it basically gave form to the modern zombie. Although the word vampire is used in this book, and aspects of vampire lore (garlic, crosses, etc..), the behavior of the ""afflicted"" is really what later characterizes the zombie.The author's writing is superb, he creates great vivid imagery and you really get inside the mind of the main character, Robert Neville. Since I felt I knew the character so well I found it hard to put down the book. How can he survive alone in a world where everyone else seems to be infected and wanting eat his flesh and drink his blood? How long can he stay boarded up in his house while the ""vampires"" try to break in night after night?When you have finished the book you will understand the meaning of the title, and the real meaning of the book. For fans of horror, zombies, etc... it's a definite must. If not just for its historical value in the genre."
5,Outstanding science fiction/horror novel...,"The other reviews have done a good job of describing this excellent book, but have failed to note an important item of interest regards to this; it was the basis for the outstanding Vincent Price film ""Last Man on Earth"" which follows the book very well. It was also the basis for the Charleton Heston film ""The Omega Man"", which follows the book a little more loosely but is also quite good. If you have seen the Price film, you will recognize it as you read the book. This is an outstanding novel which will make you feel the extreme loneliness experienced by the character Neville as he exists day to day alone searching for the hiding places of the plague created undead to destroy them and then at night holing up in his fortified house as they come out to pound on his doors yelling ""...come out, Neville...""!! Chilling....!!"
3,Original Worse than the Movie!,"99% of the time I will always say ""the book was better"". In this case, I couldn't say it. Even though I saw the movie first then read the book it didn't make a difference. The story is disjointed, and doesn't fill you in on the past. The ending is horrible. No one would be satisfied with the way it ended. That being said it's a pretty good zombie book for the time that it was written."
3,Lots of extras,"Decent story, different by today's standard. The book size is deceiving though as the main story stops end about half way through."
2,NOT so great.,"I purchased this book since the movie was good. I figure the book would be even better. I was so wrong. Of course, if you like vampires, then you will like this book. The ending was uneventful and confusing."
2,A deceiving title,"I know that not all movies are gonna resemble the book. Sometimes the movie is far from the book. This book is far far far from the movie. I dont know how they made a movie from this book but it's 100% different. And there are all these different stories that have nothing to do with what I am Legend was supposed to be about. There is nothing that states there are different stories mixed in which I may also add make no sense. I wish I could return this, it was a big disappointment."
1,has little in common with the film,"I wasn't a big fan of the movie, which I saw first, but this book was even less noteworthy. Some broad themes were used by the film but it ended there. Mostly a vampire book so if you are into that, perhaps it is worth a look. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Not science fiction by any stretch of the imagination. I found the writing tedious, the pacing glacial and ending a disappointment. Thank goodness I got this as a Kindle book for 99 cents. Even that may have been too much."
3,Haven't finished !,"I loved the movie, so I had to buy the book ! I haven't finished it, which is why I only gave three stars, but so far so good ! It isn't like the movie of course , but it gives a good descriptive story about how Robert Neville lived and survived all the tragedy that hit him."
3,Not movie-tie as cover leads to believe,"I purchase and collect movie-tie in books for the sole purpose of reading the book prior to the movie. I have been waiting for this book to come out since I saw the trailer. The cover leads one to believe that this book is a movie-tie in book. It isn't unless Will Smith in the movie has blond hair and blue eyes. However, aggravated I was with this misleading information, the book was good. Not sure why the other short stories are added into this book. If publisher are going to put the movie cover on a book - the inside should reflect the movie not just a reprint. If I wanted to read the original I would have saved my 7.99 and went to the library months ago. If you are looking to read the book that reflects the movie its not this so save your money and get it at the library."
2,yuck!,this book did not intrest me at all!Yeah it was scary but not the good kindof scare if you know what I mean.I do not recommend this book.
1,movie way better then book,not too many times I can say a movie was better than the book - this is one of those times.
4,"Worthwhile, with a truly powerful ending","I AM LEGEND is a powerful tale of one man's life in an alienated world. While seemingly an 'end of the world' novel, Matheson manages not to fall into clisché, and his story is allways powerful and centered. The book is somewhat dated, and at times maybe unclear, but those are minor points. the ending, when Matheson's tale switches, is powerful, unexpected, and touching."
4,I Am Legend,"This was a very interesting story, although not at all what I thought it would be. I expected more of an almost 'Resident Evil' style adventure. What it turned out to be was a brooding, introspective vampire story that took very little from the Bram Stoker world (and I mean that in a good way - I think 'Dracula' is an awful book).I would recommend this to anyone. There are good story ideas here, it was well paced, it had a few legitimately frightening / tense moments, and it help my interest the whole way."
4,Don't forget the other stories.,"I am legend is great, propably the second best vampire novel since Dracula. I just want to mention the other (short/er) stories in this anthology. Alot of reviewers only talk about ""I am Legend"". I can understand that; since it is the title story and the longest story of this anthology. But, in my opinion, the story ""Dance of the Dead"" is far greater. It alone is worth the price of this anthology. It has the dystopian atmosphere of ""A clockwork orange"" and the nightmarish visual themes of the great J.G.Ballard. Only a master writer can get that mix within 17 pages (and before Anthony Burgess and J.G.Ballard)."
5,Awesome,I have watched this movie many times. My kids (teenagers) love it too. Could be intense for some. Most will love.
3,Go see the movie instead.,"I gave ""I Am Legend"" 3 stars because it's uniquely different from run of the mill vampire stuff. However, I was disappointed. It's a short story, barely long enough to promote the lead character, and much of the text seemed, to me anyway, unrelated to the storyline - filler if you will. Having suffered through that the story becomes interesting, and then, yes and then - it's over, as in finished, done with, fini. And I truly felt let down. Yes, I read the book but didn't like it. Forget the book - go see the movie; it's really good."
3,Just left me with more questions...,"For anyone that hasn't seen the film or read the book........the book is nothing like the film.......and the film is nothing like the book.. Normally, when a film is based on a book I love the book so much more. But not this time. I have to say that I'm liking the film more this time.The book is good, don't get me wrong. I was scared in parts. However, it's nothing like the film. If you're looking for similar, but better, read 'Salems Lot' by Stephen King.The only thing the book and the film have in common is that they both involve a man who is probably one of the last few survivors after a virus strikes the population.With both though, I'm left with lots of questions that aren't addressed and it's frustrating to be 'almost' at the point of knowing it all, but not quite having enough information. I read the book thinking that the unanswered questions from the film would be answered, but all it's done is given me more questions."
2,This was average at best,"It's sad that they had to put Will Smith on the cover in order to generate interest. I'm pretty sure that the movie remake will be much different than this book. There will probably be more action and plot holes will be filled and expanded. And Smith doesn't seem like he could portray the same tortured soul from the book.Anyway, on with the book review - after all the hype I expected something better. This story has influenced a lot of authors and filmmakers so I wanted to like it. And Matheson is the guy who wrote Stir of Echoes which is one of my favorite movies. But I didn't enjoy reading this.The plot seemed to be lacking something and there were not really any characters I could relate to except maybe the dog. In fact, I might have enjoyed this better if it were from the dog's point of view rather than a misogynist drunk who somehow miraculously teaches himself bacteriology and solves the riddle of the plague all by himself."
2,If everyone is a vampire... then what do they eat?,"I think fiction has to follow rules it creates. Take example the last sentence at the end of the paragraph at the back of the book.""How long can one man survive in a world of vampires?""Twist this around...""How long can vampires survive in a world of one man?"""
3,Misleading,"Though the first half of this book was very good, I was definitely disappointed that only the first half of the book was actually 'I Am Legend'. There wasn't anything indicating that the book was written this way. It took me a while to realize that the last half had nothing to do with the first half because I haven't seen the movie yet. I just kept thinking ""what is going on?"" I also was quite disappointed in the short stories at the end too and don't think they should have been there."
2,Not very unique in my experience,"Kind of a combination of Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula. I was so not ready for the ending I kept turning the page, like what happened. It just ends, that's it? I didn't like it at all, although I will say at times I found it disturbing. Short story material, not a novel."
4,Book is great,"THe book is great, but what they don't tell you is that this book is one of short stories and a novella. The novella is ""I am Legend"" which is about 177 pages. The rest of the book is short stories; some good, most only adequate. ""I am Legend"" is worth the price of admission."
5,"Enthralling, short read.","This is one of the best short books I've read. This version has several short stories by the author in the back, which are well-written."
3,Very good story.....lousy ending.,"Good writing style, but lousy ending, particularly when the book ends halfway and you are left with short tales that I, at first, thought were a continuation of the novel. While there are always vampires outside the hero's house, you only get one good vampire/hero encounter...The woman leader of the new society is bizarre to say the least and the only person the reader gets to meet from the new society. The story has much potential (I find myself building on the story), but the author lacked the ability to spin out a good ending."
5,Wow,"this was so different from the movie that you can still respect the 2 as seperate but equal. i really enjoyed all teh short stoires and had a good time readign this book, it was hard to put down"
3,"Great story, but only half the book?","I thought this was a great story, well laid out with a good pace. There weren't too many lulls or too much action. I can't compare to the movie because I haven't seen it. The only disappointing thing about this book is that the I Am Legend story only takes up the first half, so just when you think things are getting exciting, the story ends! The rest of the book is filled with short stories by the author that have nothing to do with I Am Legend."
2,OK at best.,"This book was a real letdown. I did enjoy the story but when I came to page 159 I was shocked to see that it ended. I think a lot more of the story could have been told. I looked over the entire paperback to see where it stated that it was a book of short stories. Nowhere does it state that. Even the narrative on the back cover only talks about the ""I am Legend"" story. I've been robbed!!!"
5,THE vampire novel of the 20th century,"The title says it all. The last days of the last man on Earth. Richard Matheson paints a pretty grim World, and of the conflicts of Robert Neville as he struggles to cope with the loss of his wife and child and of the rest of the known world. Matheson expertly puts us in Neville's position and the sadness and futily at times in overwelming. A superb testament to the writing of one of the best writers of the 20th century. Buy it...buy it today."
4,A good book!,I bought this book just based on reader's reviews and found it to be a good read. It has more than just I am Legend within it and found it to be a lot more than I had bargained for!
4,An important vampire story,I AM LEGEND is one of the most important vampires stories written. A lot of what hollywood has done with both vampire and zombies come from this novella. Chuck Heston has done at least two movies based on it. The writing is crisp. The story movies at a pace not usually found in horror writing and the whole things wraps up neatly. If you like this kind of stuff then you need to read this.You need to read this before the movie comes out. Too good of a novella to not be read before the movie makes a mockery of the story.
4,Awesome read,"Nice story with surprising twists, turns, and ending. Having only seen the Will Smith movie, this completely different storyline was refreshing to me."
2,I Am Legend,"I was under the impression that this was a novel. The book doesn't let on that it was a compilation of short stories. So, when I reached the end of the Short Story half way through the book ""I AM LEGEND"" I felt disillusioned, if not tricked.The story was interesting but not very moving. There were inconsistencies as well. The main character visits the mausoleum where the body of his baby girl is being held, later in the story he mentions that the body was taken from his arms and burned with a multitude of others. (What really happened?)In any case, I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. I hope the movie is better."
4,NOT a complete novel,"First off I am Legend is great.. all 160+ pages of it.. That being said the book is not just the Vampire story ""I am Legend"" You get the I AM LEGEND short story then 10 other short stories of varying quality after that. Nowhere on the cover of the book is this explained to you. That is kind of a let down. The book should cost MUCH less than it's face value OR better explain exactly what you are getting."
3,Almost Legendary,"Not quite all it could be...just settling down to enjoy a good novel that would hopefully last a week or so, and finished it in one night. Felt it had a lot more to offer, even though it did have a relatively satisfying ending. Brief, shocking and to the point, the story is luridly entwined around one man's stance against loneliness, and how he responds to unexpected development. Excellent scientific and biological descriptions of vampire anatomy, good characterisation and solid emotional descriptions, but once again, the tale winds down prematurely. Saddened that the second half of the book is filled with four-page long short stories that, although well written, would better serve as furthered chapters of the headline title.Still waiting for more....."
5,I am the legend,This is a great book that ties in with the movie it's based on.I think you should read it and enjoy.I hope you read this book.
2,I Feel A Tad Ripped Off,"I've seen the 1970's movie version called ""The Omega Man"" based on this story but I'd never read the original which is why I purchased this book. The story is okay... not bad. My rating is due to the fact that I assumed I was paying for a novel and instead bought a book of short stories; the first of which is ""I Am Legend"". There is nowhere on the cover... front, back or spine, that warns this is a collection of short stories. I rarely buy short stories. As a rule, I prefer novels and would not have bought this one had I known. Tacky way to sell books... tacky and blatantly dishonest.Richard Matheson is decent author and screenwriter but this book is merely a means to use the upcoming movie to sell a handful of mediocre short stories. Appalling way to treat his fans and consumers in general."
4,Movie is different!!,"I had seen the movie and liked it so much that I could not wait to read the book! Unfortunatly, the book was a slight disappoinment. It is very different from the movie so do not expect the same ""cancer drug"" issue or the same ending."
3,"I Am Legend would have sufficed, thank you","I Am Legend is great book that can really make one think for a long time. It has a great ending that has yet to be captured in any of the films made of the book, The Last Man on Earth(1964), The Omega Man(1972), and I am Legend(2007). I am Legend was surprisingly short, coming in at 160 pages. The rest of the book is filled with some of Richard Matheson's short stories which I could have done without. I would have easily given the book another star or two had the short stories not been included because they were just plain bad. A lot of them started off well just to disappoint at the end and the rest were just bad from start to finish."
2,nothing like the movie..,"Usually the book is so much better than the movie, not in this case. First of all I Am Legend is a short story. The only things the movies and the book have in common are: a dog is briefly in the book and the main character's name is the same. I was very disappointed."
2,It had good intentions...,"This book is vastly different than the movie, and there's a reason. The movie producers didn't want their movie to suck. About half way through the book, the story ended, then the author started writing short stories that had nothing to do with the book.So you have this fantastic vampire story that has tested time, then suddenly BAM brick wall. After the brick wall, you have a dozen short stories about voodoo, a man who magically wins carnival games, and coming of age stories where a kid is shocked because she experiences a rave for the first time. Oh no!"
1,"reviewing the book, not the story","Rather than repeat the good reviews on the story of ""I am Legend"" I am offering a review of the book itself. I am disappointed in the marketing ploy of this book, relying on the movie to sell the book. Nowhere on the cover, the back of the book or the inside flap does it state this is a compilation of short stories. It instead relies on the reader's interest in the movie with Will Smith to sell the book. In fact, the story itself used to sell the book is only 159 pages of the 312 page book. There are in fact 11 stories in this book. Not all of them great reads. I probably would have bought it anyway but I resent the obvious deception that this entire book was a novel of the one story, ""I am Legend"" and was hoping for much more. The story itself was good and well written. I will wait until the DVD is released to see the movie. I won't buy books again from TOR without researching further to find the truth about their packaging and what is actually inside."
1,I Am Legend,"Excellent descriptive writing. Unfortunately, there is more description than plot. ""I Am Legend"" turns out to be more a novella than novel and the paperback contains several unrelated short stories that immediately follow. Regrettably, there are no notes that indicate this arrangement and one finds oneself wading through the short stories (also heavy on description, lean on plot) before realizing that ""I Am Legend"" ended many pages back."
1,I am legend,"This book sucks, you read it and get to the middle of the book to be left with no sort of ending. The author then just goes off and writes a whole bunch of stupid short stories which you think are going to bring you back to the main character, but doesn't and your left feeling like you just wasted all your time reading this stupid book."
1,Maybe I don't like horror books,"This is one of only a few horror books that I have read, but I didn't think this book was good at all. Maybe it was inventive at the time it was written, but now it doesn't strike me as very clever at all. It is extremely boring for one thing. It isn't exciting, it isn't scary, it's really depressing and boring. The end is good, but even that can't make it get above a 1 star for me. I was happy the book was over (I hate to stop reading a book in the middle)."
1,NOT CLOSE TO WHAT I EXPECTED!!!!!!!!,"When you watch the movie, you must get your hands on the book. Not this one!!!!It was too confusing so on page 97, I quit. If you don't like being confused, don't read this."
1,I am Legend: The Book,"I am not displeased with the company who sent me the book or Amazon, or anything like that.This book however is terrible. This was the first book my book club has read and we all agreed to never read it again!Also the first time any of us has ever been able to say that the MOVIE was actually better than the book!!! lol"
1,I am Legend book,"This book is nowhere even close to as good as the movie. I have never read a book which was made into a movie in which the movie was better than the book, until now."
5,Suprising. A lot of Mathison in a little book!,"Great all around. Suspenseful. Grips you right up to the end, and you'll be surprised.What didn't come across to me before buying the book is that ""I Am Legend"" is only the first 80% of the novel. The remainder is a series of unrelated short stories. I was confused and tried to link those stories to the main material at first; then I realized that they were separate works.The short stories are worth the purchase price alone, they're interesting, thought provoking glimpses into other worlds. Their subject matter ranges from humor, to war; from surreal, to outright horror. Each one is self-contained and leaves your imagination free to turn the story around in your head afterwards.Very satisfying read."
5,Horror stories and novellas by Richard Matheson,"Brrr. Horror stories are not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the strangeness of Will Smith in the movie production ofI Am Legend. Often books read after the movie give the reader a deeper understanding of the plot. So I tackled this one.In this case, it's almost a different story. I won't say anymore about this, except that the finale is quite different.This volume is a collection of the ""I Am Legend"" novella, and a number of short stories. Some of these stories are quite suspenseful, in particular ""Mad House,"" ""From Shadowed Places,"" and ""Person To Person.""Matheson has a written a number of books. Are they all horror books?Brrr."
5,A gem - a must read for any sci fi /horror fan,"Wonderfully fast paced and extremely well written don't begin to do this gem of a book justice. Written in 1954!!! I'm in awe - it is that good.I'm not gonna go on about the plot or characters, other reviews do that.I rented it from the Library, because I liked the deeply flawed movie. The movie in only very minor ways matches the book. The book IS better. WAY. BETTER. I loved it. You will too - go read it."
3,Very 1950s,"This started as an interesting lone-survivor/end of the world story. I was disappointed at the lack of any ""End of the World"" feeling or story. The author missed an opportunity.I quickly grew bored with Neville's sniveling and drinking.There were lots of things in the story that were unclear. The twist at the end was a surprise. In fact, so surprising that I'm not sure what happened.I was annoyed to find that it was a novella (about 160 pages) with a collection of short stories. The novella, I am Legend, was why I bought the book. I read the first six short stories. They read like not quite complete Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episodes. I may read the rest of the stories eventually, but I was not interested enough to finish them now.I am Legend was a good enough story, but the telling of it had holes. The writing was uninspired.As mediocre as this book was, it was worlds better than ""The Road."""
4,Great Read,"I did not realize that this book was written so long ago. There have been two movies created from it 'The Omega Man' staring Charlton Heston, released in 1971 and 'I am Legend' staring Will Smith released in 2007. There is talk that Warner Bros. are going to make 'I am Legend 2' soon.I really enjoyed this original story, even though neither of the movies followed the story line. I would recommend to my friends!"
4,Classic,"To my understanding, this book is what most modern vampire and zombie movies are based. A great ready for any fan of the genre,but yet also a great read for anyone who likes a well written book."
3,I preferred the movie,"I purchased this book because of the movie, thinking it would be similar. I guess in a way it is, last person alive, vampires trying to get to him. What I didn't realize was this book was written back in the 50s and it really doesn't have anything to do with the movie with Will Smith. Now this is a short book, it's pretty good, I like the idea, but I prefer books more closer to my era. It's very easy reading, a page turner. If you are looking for a good quick read this is the book for you. If you are looking for the movie in writing, avoid this book. I did like the movie much better than this book."
3,Moderate but interesting,"The book does show what the reader is looking for but rather short in a way. Though the auothr did not intend for a motion picture to book thing, I think the book was rather more detail but still a bit short. Then also The other stories not dealing with the title only what the author wrote , should be more clear"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A man, perhaps the last human alive, has to fight off otherworldly-plague created vampires by day, and try and hide and survive during the night.Alone in his quest, and dealing in gore and violence in large amounts, every day, does not do wonders for his mental health, needless to say."
2,This Book Has No Point,"This book is about a scientist who is in a heavy depression all by himself. He drinks all day and sleeps all night almost everyday for two years. He spends his days starring at naked zombie women. That is pretty much the book until the ending that is beyond stupidity, It makes the book useless. He contributed nothing in the story and somehow he is a legend. I for one have never seen a legend do nothing and then fail at everything else."
1,Blah.,"This story neither gathered my attention, and I like to read about vampires, nor did the middle or ending do anything for my sensiblities for a horror story. Awful. just awful. Sorry, Matheson."
1,Wish I'd never started it.,Life is too short to read a book like this. I hope this movie is better because I like Will Smith!
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I Am LegendThe book's namesake provides a mediocre story at best. The short stories that accompany it are ridiculous, lackluster, and unintelligible. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,I Am Uninteresting,"This book reminds me this one day I got sick and almost died. I eventually got better, but a few years later I read this book. At that moment I wish I would have died just so I could have been spared reading this goobly-dee-gook.And the vampires are the dumbest vampires in any book. How do you have a vampire book where no one dies? The protaganist kills some vampire, yeah? so what, I mean at least he could have had a flashback where his family is eaten or torn to shreds rigth before his eyes...oh man, that would have been sweet. Instead his girl gets sick, blah blah blah, nobody cares. And would it have killed Matheson to put in some monkeys somewhere?"
1,I AM LEGEND,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid....I also read the book first and thought it was one of the best reads of my life....I recently bought a new copy of the book and still liked it very much....however I also recently purchased the movie version and it was TOTALLY laughable.....one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....so bad I suppose it could be a CULT CLASSIC in the same vein as ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES or REEFER MADNESS.....don't waste the money if you expect anything otherwise!
2,Legend in their own mind,I didn't care for this book. Slow and a bit boring. Very short. Did not live up to my expectations.
3,Alright,"The only reason I read this book was because of the movie. I liked the movie, not so much the book. It was interesting, but when I finished it I felt a little cheated. Also there's some other wierd short stories at the end of the book that I glanced through and found to be boring. Save your money and watch the movie."
3,What happened?,"The first 100 pages were great, then it went down hill from there. Not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more. Maybe when it was written the ending would have been sufficient, but 50 years later it's kind of a let down. What was with the short stories? Is Matheson an Edgar Allen Poe fan or what his deal? It's hard to beleive that in just 170 pages a book went from a great read in the beginning to very dissapointing end. If it wasn't for the first half of the story being so good, I'd only give this 1 star, and as far as the short stories I guess they were pretty original for the time period, but they should have been in a seperate book."
2,don't believe the hype,"My expectation were high after reading the comments by other authors, but after finishing the book i was extremely dissappointed. The book seems to aimed at young children and is too short to develop an interesting story line. I didn't care much for the short stories either."
3,Beware of book - other stories included!,"Buyer beware! I thought when I was purchasing this book that the ENTIRE book was the story ""I am Legend."" It's not. The story is only the first 170 pages of the book. The remaining 147 pages are of short stories by the author. I feel deceived. No where on the front or back cover does it tell you that. Books are expensive and I don't feel I got what I paid for. The story ""I am Legend"" was great, but the short stories have something to be desired. Just be aware of this before you purchase."
2,30-Year Audiobook Listener,"The ""I Am Legend"" disaster-wipes-out-most-of-mankind story is mildly interesting, but the narration is hard to listen to. The remaining stories are dated and the narration so poor, I gave up halfway through the book. Look for another presentation of ""I Am Legend""."
2,This is a novella with a collection of bad short stories tacked on!,"I gave this 2 stars because the novella, I am Legend, is interesting. Had it been published on its own, or if there was at least some warning that completely unrelated short stories were going to immediately follow it, unannounced, as just chapters, I would have given this 4 stars. I am Legend is drastically different from the movie. Just consider it a different story with the same name. The short stories that follow the novella are nowhere near as interesting or good in quality. I wish I had read some of the reviews here beforehand so I wouldn't have wasted my time reading them, bored, and highly confused as to how they related to the first half of the book."
5,one of the best,"I am Legend is the best of two of my favorite genres; post-apocalyptic fiction and vampire stories. Reading this for the first time many years after it was published, it is amazing to see how much it has influenced movies and books that came later. It's a very quick read that makes you wish it were longer."
3,I Am Legend...a pretty good Vampire book.,"Just ""pretty good""...that's the best I can say. At 170 pages, you hardly get into it and it's over. I enjoyed this book but can't see how so many reviewers are able to call it the best Vampire novel ever. Calling it a novel is a stretch in the first place. It's a short story. And the characters don't compare to Anne Rice's in complexity. To me, when you take away the mystery of the Vampire by labeling it as a bacterial infection, you take away the enjoyment of the whole genre. It's a worthwhile read but far from the best."
2,Depressive,The writer had trouble giving his main character depth and an orderly sequence of events would have given the reader a developing interest.
5,not a bad book,The seller provided a great service. THe book shipped arrived on time and in great shape. I would purchase from this seller again.
2,"Main story bad, backups worse.","I never heard of Richard Matheson's work before seeing the Will Smith movie version of I Am Legend. I'm not proud of that knowing that he pretty well thought of but after reading, or at least trying to read this I'm not exactly sure why. The main story here while almost nothing like the movie also wasn't that good. The story could have been fleshed out and the ""science"" didn't make much sense. The ending was good but overall not very good in my opinion. Sadly the rest of the book contained short stories that I struggled to get through then finally relented and gave up. Cliché followed cliché which is odd for stories printed so long ago. Overall this is something that is better about than read."
3,It's ok... but pissed me off,"The story is actually very good and entertaining and well written. I give all the kudos to it. It was a very unique and in depth story that ended way to soon.The big problem is that halfway through, the story just ends. Your done by an abrupt ending and are left thinking ""wtf? was that the end?""Of course that isn't the end there is still half a book to read... Only problem is that half the book has nothing to do with I Am Legend. It is a series of crappy short stories.So in conclusion to my ramblings it is a good story that is way to short and the ending is abrupt and very poorly done. So many strings were left open. It suffered the fate of so many movies and books... bad ending. I don't know if there is a sequel to this, but if there is that could help clear up the confusion."
2,That's it?,"I ordered this book after seeing a preview for the Will Smith adaption out this year (hence the cover). Great story, though much shorter than I thought. The reason for this poor review is because of the packaging. I had no idea I am Legend was one of almost a dozen other short stories in this book. The book itself if 312 pages long. I am Legend ends around page 162. No where on the cover, spine of back cover of the book does it say ""I am Legend and other assorted short stories."" I thought I paid for a novel, not a short story."
4,Great vampire story,"The story I Am Legend is a very well-written vampire story with a nice twist. It's not the usual vampire hunter type book, but ends up making you look at things from two different points of view. It's amazing that the author can keep the reader interested and captivated in the story of one single man. As an avid reader of Anne Rice, Stephen King, and Dean Koontz, I was apprehensive at first about this novel, but ended up being very satisfied. The other stories in the book are hit or miss, some better than others. He does have an interesting writing style and interesting ideas. Some of his short stories were a little on the windy side, but all in all he's a rare mind. Definitely worth picking up and reading the whole thing though, especially I Am Legend."
4,Great SHORT Novella,"This was a great novella! I absolutly loved it, everyone should go buy ""Detained Differences"" by J. Robert Rowe, that should also be a movie made from novel as well!"
5,Pretty Color,"Keep looking for a photo of the color, it's out there somewhere. This is a mauvy light pink, that's neutral and inconspicuous, nice everyday color."
4,The Silent One Steps It Up,"Page McConnell steps out of the shadows of his old Phish band-mates and presents VIDA BLUE, featuring the all-star rhythm section of Oteil Burbridge and Russell Batiste. Released virtually under the radar with little publicity or hype, Vida Blue is a collection of seven original tracks ranging from techno-funk excursions to mellow piano soul.McConnell's wide array of keyboards and synths glide over the percolating bass and drum interplay of Burbridge and Batiste to create the truly unique sound which is Vida Blue. Kudos to Page and the band for taking a risk and releasing music that is true to themselves without selling out or caving in to radio-friendliness."
5,Great Stuff,"As a long time Phish fan, I tend to purchase just about every side project Phish members put out. Vida Blue is far from another side project, it probably ranks right up there with Oysterhead in terms of musicianship. Personally, I enjoy the Vida blue material more than the last Phish release.Otiel Burbidge is a phenomenal base player, I highly recommend picking up his solo work and ARU stuff. I was not familiar with Russell Bastiste's playing, but after listening to this album I decided to pick up some of his work. Overall, Vida Blue's first release a must have for anyone who likes jambands."
2,Cheesy and Boring,"If you like disco beats and goofy lyrics sung by an even goofier singer, then you'll love this cd. Otherwise, you should check out 'The illustrated band', which is the same band, plus some, but Page is obviously not driving the bus, and that's a very good thing. The grooves on 'Vida Blue' are weak and don't even begin to demonstrate the monstrous talent of Otiel Burbridge and Russell Batiste, and even Page for that matter.Overall it's not terrible, but it is very dissapointing. A waste of talent indeed, and a waste of money for me."
4,Nice Costume,This was a great costume for my son's 5th birthday party. I would definitely buy the robe to go with it though. It is the typical costume quality but my son loved it.
4,Good,"A little too expensive for the quality, but overall it is good because my son loved it. Hasn't stopped wearing for a month, so the smiles and fun are worth it."
1,Flimsy rubbish,"Looks great on the picture but when you open the pack the costume seams are not sown, the fabric is so thin as not to be there and the belt...........!! Look elsewhere for a Jedi costume."
4,"Fun, cheap costume","If your little Jedi will be wearing this on a daily basis, I would look elsewhere. For a $16 Halloween costume, this is perfectly adequate. Size medium fit my 52-53"" child well with growing room. I would say size is generous EXCEPT for the boot covers. They are ridiculously small! The foot flap only came about halfway over his foot."
5,Good quality for the right price,"The coloring on the costume varies slightly from what is pictured, but not in anyway that makes the costume unlikeable. My daughter was thrilled when it arrived, and is so excited to be a jedi knight for Halloween. The price was significantly lower at amazon than any of the other online costume retailers, and we are very happy with the quality, the fit, and the value. (My daughter is 4, almost 5, and the costume fits very nicely.)"
4,Good as you would expect!,We received this costume for our six year old son and its wonderful. Its the same quality you will get at a Halloween store in town. Overpriced and not amazing quality. But our son loves it. He is thrilled to be Luke this year and it will probably last him a year of role playing as all his costumes in his closet...Costume seems true to size also. My son wears a 5-6T and the small fit perfectly. if my son was any bigger than a 6T i would probably have needed a Medium
3,Good value,"Quick delivery, ordered this costume Tuesday, arrived Thursday. It is a perfect fit for my 5 year old and looks durable enough to last us through Halloween and beyond. She couldn't wait to put it on and play. The Lightsaber did not come with the costume but we already had one so that's fine. Love the fact the pants are separate and therefore easy for bathroom visits. Good value, not bad quality compared to most costumes and a nice fit."
3,"Very cute, very flimsy","This costume looks really, really cute when worn. I do have a couple complaints, though. First, the neck hole is adjustable by tying in the back, and it looks really cheap. Second, the elastic strap to secure the ""boots"" to your regular shoe broke immediately when we were putting on. Not a huge deal, but disappointing. Overall, I was satisfied with the costume."
4,Luke Skywalker costume,My son had lots of fun wearing this costume. He's been wanting for quite a while...
2,Very Cheaply Made,"I bought this for my 6 year-old to wear for Halloween. I really wasn't expecting great quality since these costumes are usually pretty cheap, but this is beyond cheap. The boots aren't sewn on correctly. One boot faces front and one faces backward, which mean when he wears it, he has to twist one of the pant legs so the boot is facing the right direction. My son doesn't seem to care though, so I won't be returning it even though I should. Also the velcro that holds the back together is only sewn with a few stitches so I don't expect it to last more than a few wears."
2,Costume review,"Ordered the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn Deluxe Child Costume for son for Christmas. Based on the measurements provided, I purchased a size medium. It runs very large and my son was swimming in it. It is the usual costume quality, nothing fancy. Also, purchased Darth Vader costume for my daughter and again, it ran very large and I have tall children."
4,Sizes are WAY TOO BIG,"This is an excellent costume, but the sizes are misleading. I would strongly recommend that you buy it one size smaller than you think you need. My nephew was very happy with it, but I was disappointed that it was entirely too big for him."
1,Poor quality and extremely disppointed,"I bought this custom for my son. Before I placed the order, I read the review on this custom. I thought in general it's not bad. However, after I got the custom, I'm extremely disappointed with quality. The edges of the custom are not sewed,which are different form the picture shown on the website and the picture is misleading. The worst part is the neck cut is too small. My son likes the custom. I haven't decide what to do. If I want to keep it, I have to do some work on it."
2,Not as pictured,"I'm very disappointed in this costume! The picture shows a costume with hemmed edges, and a nice belt made on faux leather. Not so. All edges were raw cut edges and the belt was painted and ugly, and won't hold up. The size we bought for my son was 8-10. He wears and 8 and has size 4 feet. The boot covers came no where close to fitting over his shoes. This one is going back."
1,Poor workmanship and design not similar to the picture,"I ordered this costume for my boy's starwar birthday party but was quite disappointed with the followings:-1. The workmanship of this costume is poor.2. No seam sewing.3. Not true to size, runs big4. doesn't looks like picture indicate.5. Not cotton, will be hot for summer."
5,Great battle scenes and great characters and great history,"What a very enjoyable story. The battle scenes are gripping, the villains are immensely hate-able, the heroes and heroines are hugely heroic AND human, and there is an air of authenticity to the setting and details that is just plain satisfying. I love that the story deals with some aspects of the American Revolution that are downplayed elsewhere. I love that the protagonist is a former slave.The compelling everyday detail in city scenes and camp scenes makes you feel that you can smell the setting. Cameron's command of the historical big picture is enticing. I hope there will be a sequel. I can hardly wait to find out what happens next."
1,"Horrible, I'll donate this one to my maid",I can't believe I got this as a gift. I'm certainly not going to keep it. The diva has an ugly voice. And the acting is about the same as a silent film actress...overdone. The worst recital I've ever heard.
5,FANTASTICALLY INFORMATIVE!!!!,"Author Seth Pouliot does an incredible job of explaining every aspect of life on the UMass, Amherst campus. Countless college subjects were covered, especially to the interest of incoming freshman. All of his descriptions were honest and clear! I encourage all to buy this book!!!"
5,THE best snow removal device out there!,"I needed a tool better than a standard snow shovel to clear my large parking area and long driveway. I didn't want a snow blower because they sit 6+ months of the year (even in lower Michigan).Well, this is IT! I can clear my driveway and parking area in under 20 minutes. Make it a total of a half hour and my sidewalks are done, too!In addition, because I never have to LIFT any snow, my back doesn't hurt when I'm through.I'd rate the scoop with more than 5 stars if I could. It's simple, reasonable in cost, and works even BETTER than the company's website claims is does!!"
3,"Restrained, for sharpe","The story of a publisher, Frensic, who convinces an unimaginative would-be author, Peter Piper, to pretend authorship of a wildly successful, pornographic novel. It's a funny book, though not riotously so: more witty and arch, or getting its humor by deflating stereotypes. Its plot is devious and twisted, but though there's sex and a riot and some explosions, it seems restrained compared to other Sharpe books. I must say I don't care much for the abrupt, highly unsatisfying ending. Start reading Sharpe with Wilt or Blott."
1,cover is the best part of this video.,"Not the Bobby Driscoll version, a big yawn. Should be marketed as a PBS documentary and B movie from the 50s."
5,for all your dogs,I have been using Animal Natural products for years. I've settled on this one because it gives my older dogs zip and my younger ones endurance.I now have one in chemotherapy and her vets say she is in great condition considering her medical issues.
5,It speak's for its self?,What more can i say? If your starting and your looking to invest your money in a sound product..1200's....If your seasoned and still spinning vinyl..than you should already know. The 1200 has stood the test of time and is going nowhere! Look for other reviews on longevity or quality and theyll point you in this direction and i have yet to regret it!
4,Problems with the size,"I love this shoes, and I typically have size 8 feet, 8.5 is a bit large for me. I had to return this shoes in order to obtain a size larger, since 8M was too small somehow. I recommend you get a half size larger than you would normally buy."
2,Talk Flow T-Strap Pump,This is a good pump. I thought the heel was too high for me. I returned the pump.
4,Good service,I recieved the shoes in a timely manner and when I needed to exchange for a different size I didn't have any problems. I did end up returning the shoes. They were shaped rather odd and I couldn't wear them.
2,software didn't work,"Although the book cleared up a few very basic concepts, the software didn't work and I had to find a suitable form on-line, which I could have done without the book. I sent an e-mail to tech support but received no answer (and therefore no resolution). Although I eventually on my own got to where I needed to go, it was not so much through this book. NOT a good value and I do NOT recommend it. Why didn't Quicken WillMaker simply provide a link to sample Grant Deeds."
1,Strangely small insize,"Usually take a size 11, so ordered those, but they were strangely small.Don't understand all the raves here about this shoe!"
4,Very Nice,"Represents over a decade of teaching Vector Analysis at Stanford with origins in Fluid Mechanics. There's intellectual wiggle-room in the writing, no doubt about it. Liked it!"
5,This book made me love reading,"Many years ago my 7th grade teacher made me read this book. It opened my eyes to the joy of reading. Among the thousands of books I have read since then, this book will always be the ""best book I ever read"". Thank you Mrs.Levine."
5,This is a great book,This is a great book. This is a wonderfull book. This is a marvelous book. This book is really a novel. This novel is great. This novel is wonderfull. This novel should be read be all true American patriots. This is a lovely novel. It is full of romance. It is full of compassion. This book encourages stong family ties. This book encorages a strong work ethic.
4,How Green was My valley,I think that the beginning of the book was the worst part. He started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn't going to tell anyone. He didn't even say goodbye to a lady friend. so he tells us that he's leaving and then he goes back into the past. Back when he was a little kid. He tells about different experiances. how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years. he tells about all the troubles that his family went through. The end was the best part. i usually hate the endings but this one was good.this bool is meant for older people who like English books. or is it Ireland. i think it was set in Ireland
3,how green was my valley...a slightly sentimental flashback,"""How Green Was My Valley"" was an interesting, slightly sentimental flashback of a man's comming of age. I found it not to be overly exciting and I would not claim it to be a book that I simply could not put down. This book's setting is in Wales in a small minning town, in a valley, as the title implies. However, also as the title implies, the valley in the present time was not as beautiful and green as it was in the narrator, Huw's, boyhood. As the valley turns black because of the slag (waste from coal minning), Huw seems to loose more of his innoscence. Huw must cope with many tragities, including the death of his brother and father, his brothers and girlfriend moving away forever, and problems dealing with the formation of a coal minning union. Despite these tragities, in the end, when Huw has finally decided to leave the valley, he misses many of the happy memories of his childhood (the memories of his brothers, father, friends, etc...)."
5,very emotional,"This book was a part of the curriculum in my sophomore AP English class. I went into this book expecting another ""classic"". In other words, a boring book that has some symbolic meaning that students are supposed to interpret. This is by far the best school book that I have ever read and quite possibly the best book I have read period. It is a moving novel about life in which the characters grow close to your heart and you become part of the Morgan family in an English mining village. The ending is not perfect, and perhaps there isn't as much closure as one would like, but then again, life isn't perfect either. This is what makes ""How Green Was My Valley"" warm the heart and haunt the soul. I will never forget this story as long as I live, and I will carry these life lessons with me forever. I reccommend this book to everyone, and my advice is to read it with a box of tissues."
5,Beautiful and compelling,"This is a truly magnificent book, which tugs at the heart strings and takes us back to a time when the world was very different.It is a lovely tale of a family which shines through good times and bad, through joy and adversity, and which ultimately provides us with a rich tale cleverly interwoven with some of the strongest characters in literature. In addition we have the magnificent Welsh country side, the horrors of the mines and the love of a family who cannot manage without each other.It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you won't want o put it down until you have finished it."
3,Draggy,"""How Green was My Valley"" was a little over-sentimental and weepy, but served as an interesting insight into Welsh culture, society, and history. It deals with how modernisation threatens and annihilates traditional practices and occupation, which is relevant to all periods in history as we ask what we have to give up to progress. A tad depressing and overwrought, but sensitive account of a man's coming-of-age and the idea that Wales is a ""nation of song"" does make me wanna visit sometime."
4,How Green Was My Valley,"The book was delivered very quickly and it was in the shape described,like the residue of stickers on the front and back but it is serving itspurpose and I am enjoying the book. Thank you."
1,"A Hoax, A Joke, But Not Funny","This is a shameless hoax. The Cryptozoology Society of London is said to have been established on April 1st, 1848 (get it?), but, of course, the truth is the word cryptozoology wasn't coined by Ivan Sanderson until the 1930s, and reinvented by Bernard Heuvelmans in the 1950s. The book is all fiction with tidbits of factual data. It confuses creations, myths, and fantansies with the real science of Cryptozoology.Levy's fake book acts like it is nonfiction, and is NOT recommended for purchase."
1,An Unnatural Book...,"A grave disservice is being done to the earnest and hard-working Cryptozoologists worldwide everytime a newcomer to the subject cracks this book open. Not only is the book inaccurate in the valid facts it contains, it mixes the plausible with the fantastical, lumping wyverns, griffons, and manticores together with giant squid and the Sasquatch. Purportedly published under the auspices of the Cryptozoological Society of London (which doesn't exist), it is nothing more than a children's book portrayed as a scientific volume. Real Cryptozoological societies should be offended at this unabashed abuse of their hard work. Shame on the publishers. Relegate this one to stabilizing the broken leg on your kitchen table."
5,a natural history of the unnatural world,I think this is an excillent reference book for people who are interested in the field of Cryptozoology.
4,One of my favorite books on folklore,"I think a lot of people are getting steamed about this book. It is not a book on cryptozoology, but rather folklore, set up the same way as The Flight of Dragons, another very good book. It contains a ton of excellant info, on both well known and lesser known creatures, and has some excellant information. However, I could not give it a 5, since it has no real disclaimer that it is not a real crypto book. However, I think most people who have read more than a few articles on cryptos will realize right away that the book is not to be taken as serious research. My favorite sections were probably the fake journal entries, as they gave the most info, while I thought many of the personal logs got kinda of boring. So, to sum it up, If you like fantasy, mythology, ect., you will probably like this book, but if you want a serious indepth discussion on cryptos, look elsewhere, because it only skims over them."
3,A Natural History of the Unnatural World,"If you are a dyed-in-the-wool cryptozoologist then it is best to leave this book on the shelf. This is more of a New Age encyclopedia of fanciful creatures and reports that sound like they belong in a fairy tale. The illustrations are quite impressive but the info is not scientifically sound. You are better off with Costello's ""The Magic Zoo"" or Ley's ""Exotic Zoology"". If you are into Mythology then this book is definitely for you."
3,a story book,This is a fun book for kids or adults - well illustrated and layed out. this is also pure fantasy in the style of a realistic journal by a faux society. if you are looking for any real cryptozoological information look elsewhere. but for kids it's cool.
2,not pleased,I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas when she was a little over a year old. She is now 19 months. She got on it a few times but it was too hard for her to push around and got bored unless I pushed her on it.The music box never stays on it for very long because it falls off too easily. The wheels have no traction and when she is old enough to get the concept of a scooter I think she will be too big for it. I bought a trike from Costco for $15 and she has more fun with that.
3,Wheels will turn....,"I have read all of the reviews saying that the toy does not work. When we first put it together, we thought the same thing, but all you have to do is push the wheels on all the way (it takes a good deal of strength!). Once you do, it rolls just fine."
2,without a box it couldn't be returned,"My 20 month old daughter recieved this scooter for Easter from her grandparents. They were being helpful by putting it together at home before giving it to her. When she sat down she became very frustrated by the fact she wasn't going anywhere. She had the right idea, but the wheels don't move easily. The scooter part was evan worse. She pushed her heart out to barley move. It was a great idea, but not made very well. Since we didn't have the box we are stuck with toy. Her 4 year old sister didn't have any better luck. Don't buy this toy, it's a waste of money."
1,No Good - Waste of money!,"It's boring, it doesn't roll well, doesn't turn at all, no bells and whistles to keep kids interested. What a dissapointing purchase!"
2,Very poorly designed,"I got this for my 2 year old thinking he would love it. It could grow with him and turn into a scooter, he got it at his 2nd birthday party. We put it together and the wheels hardly turn, theres nothing in between the wheels and the body therefore when the child sits on the seat it presses the body even more against the wheels causing it to not turn the wheels. He never rides it and its going to waste."
1,not that great,"I thought this would be a great toy, a trike for now, a scooter for later. However, as soon as my 22 mth old who weighs 30 lbs sat on it, it applied pressure to the wheels and they would not turn well. He had more of a workout trying to move the trike than fun playing with it. Needless to say, after two times playing with it, he no longer plays with it."
1,Waste of Money!!,"The wheels didn't work good at all, worst ride on that I ever bought, waste of money...."
4,Great Toy!,I bought the Ride 2 Roll scooter for my sone for his 1st birthday. It's great because he can climb on it himself and the buttons are very easy for him to push. I have no problems with the wheels turning or the music box falling off. The smile my sone gets on his face when he climbs on ll by himself is well worth it.
1,Terrible!,I can not believe that a company would put a toy out that doesn't even work. It amazes me that they didn't test it out to see if the wheels at least rolled. THis product is a piece of junk and we are returning ours as soon as we take it apart.
2,WAY TOO HARD TO ROLL,"MY HUSBAND AND I GOT THIS TOY FOR OUR DAUGHTER THIS PAST X-MAS, SHE WAS 19 MONTHS OLD AT THE TIME AND MASTERS EVERY OTHER TOY SHE GETS. THIS ONE IS SIMPLY TOO HARD FOR HER TO PUSH. THE WHEELS ARE SO STIFF, SHE ONLY MANAGES AN INCH OR TWO AND LOSES INTEREST. SHE IS NOW FIXING TO BE TWO YEARS OLD AND STILL CAN'T SEEM TO GET AROUND ON IT. THE ONE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS TOY IS THE LITTLE MUSIC TOY THAT COMES WITH IT. SHE DANCES TO HER HEARTS CONTENT. WE PRETTY MUCH PAID ALL THAT MONEY FOR HER TO PLAY WITH THE RADIO. I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS 1ST!"
1,very discouraging,"Our daughter received this for her 1st birthday last year. And even though she is taller than average and masters everything, this ride-on was just plain discouraging. The wheels do not turn well at all-whether on carpet or tile floor or used as the transitional scooter option. She hardly ever got on it except to push the musical buttons. It was such a waste that we ended up buying her a sturdy trike for xmas two months later and have since gotten rid of the ride-on."
2,"Son loves it, but wheels are horrible...","My son just received this scooter for his second birthday and he loves the sounds and playing on it. Unfortunately the wheels are a very slick plastic and do not work at all indoors. They slide across carpet and the hard wood floor without turning. I would imagine it would work fine in the driveway, but I do not know how long these cheap wheels will last on concrete. We've had it a day, and are seriously thinking about taking it back to Toys R Us."
2,I agree - Wheels Suck,"My daughter received the scooter for her second birthday and luckily we have a gift receipt. It will be going back. The toy is very well made. However, it just doesn't roll, which for a ride on toy/scooter is a pretty big design flaw. We made sure it was properly assembled and tried it on several different surfaces (hard wood floors, carpet, tile, outside on the sidewalk) but had no luck. It took my husband 10 times as long to get it appart as it did to put it together but he was so disappointed by the toy, he was determined to get the thing back in the box so I could return it."
2,Jive Bunny is not the mix,I bought this ablum with the thought that it was going to be as good that their first album. Boy was I way way way way wrong. The only reason I don't give this 1 star is because you can stand listening to it at least twice but that about it. Don't waste your money on this one folks.
3,In The Mix,THe CD compliation is alright but not what I expected as far as the mixes are concerned. The product was shipped carefully & was delivered in the time frame I requested.In the Mix
3,Appropriate textbook for middle school or low-level high school only,"This is a good, well-written textbook with a lot of great illustrations and diagrams. However, the book is written on a very basic level, and only provides a very superficial coverage to current environmental science topics. I would not recommend this textbook for upper-level high school students. For teachers, this textbook also includes a resource CD with Powerpoints, tests, quizzes, and other worksheets."
2,"I tried, but gave up after 100 pages","I was determined to read this cover to cover for no other reason than to say I did it. I threw in the towel after 100 pages. Conceptually, it's intriguing. As for an aesthetically pleasing reading experience, I defy anyone to get through it word for word."
2,Love the concept! Hate reading it.,"Yes, I love the concept of it, but actually reading it is another story. Some of it is interesting, but it gets rather tiresome after a while. It's the type of book you put down and can't pick up again."
1,Unreadable,"This book and Bob Dylan's Tarantula are one in the same, unreadable. Let's face it, you have to be a complete Andy Warhol obsessed freak to make it through this book. If you have finished the book I'd be curious to know what you've gained.If you took the name Andy Warhol off this book it would never even see the light of day. I'm sure Andy was aware of this and that's the reason why he did it. He was caught up in that type of celebrity status and probably got a kick out of putting one on us. In that sense I tip my hat to him."
5,Love this album!,Christopher Parkening's playing was technically perfect and full of emotion on this album.
5,Loved It!,"What a totally fun way to learn about rock art just waiting for us to see in the Southwest. As a ""beginner"" I loved the good background the book provides about how these cultures came to be. Also found the maps to be invaluable as were the recipes for cooking on the road! The whole thing is told with such great fun and humor. Had me chuckling throughout. Made it a joy to read. MUCH different from most books like this that give very dry descriptions and data. Loved the continuing self-effacing references to ""old guys"". The author seems like someone who doesn't take himself too seriously and loves to enjoy himself all the while he continues to learn. Wonderful!"
1,Dries out fairly quicky.,"I was looking for something more liquid and instead I got a gel. The product dries pretty quick when used with condoms, I can not say it will without them because I have not tried. It wasnt horrible but who wants to stop and ""lube up"" more then once if its not necessary."
2,Goo Stick Dry,"Oh man, this stuff just doesn't work for personal lubrication. I get like 2 minutes into my personal lubrication and this turns into a sticky nasty mess. I mean, my guy gets to hurtin', my fingers and palm stick to him and he's just not happy like that. Well maybe you like that, and this would be good glue for you, but for my big buddy - he doesn't like stuff stickin' to him.Aww its just thick gooey mess. I mean it might work OK for, well, two person lubrication. But even then, if it's sahara desert already - dang you could get your big guy stuck up in there. It might never come out, well unless you come. But self lubrication, nope. Oh unless you're really quick - then it works great. Me I like a long stroll in the park, check out the scenery, take my time."
1,Available online.,"No doy estrellas al libro - soy su autor. Los primeros 8 capítulos están disponibles gratis en mi página bigfoot.com/~daniel.eisenberg . Con tiempo, pondré los otros capítulos. También en la página está un artículo-reseña del libro, por Antonio Cruz Casado."
2,My brother-in-law was in this!,"My brother-in-law was in this movie. He doesn't talk, but he's one of the ball room dancers. Near the end of the movie he spins a girl and she falls to the floor... don't know if that was on purpose, but they kept it in... probably for comic relief becuase this was such a boring movie. I only watched it becuase he was in it. Brenden Frasier is adorable in it, but he always is!!"
5,BEST HEAD EVER!,I LIKE THIS HEAD! I ALMOST BOUGHT ANOTHER REMO EBONY PINSTRIPE. I'M GLAD I GOT THIS ONE. IT'S GOT A GOOD SOUND!
4,triffle set,I was very pleased with this trifle set. I made a trifle for Christmas and it looked lovely
5,Best of the Bunch,"This is volume three in Luka Bop's World Psychedelic Classics Series which easily bests the Shuggie Otis comp from a few years ago and equals the Os Mutantes one from 2000 ( I think).The music and CD packaging is first class all the way. The CD is even enhanced to include a video/ film from Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou Dahomey.Though this may be a psych comp the music is very much a funk-jazz or soul jazz thing.The artists within borrowed from contemporary North American funk and Cuban rhythms popular in the late 60's and 70's and came up a sound that is best described as a rush to the head and body. If you have any love for African music or any kind of music please get this CD. Luka Bop has out done itself this time. Now can they release another Bollywood compilation.On a side note the Moussa Doumbia track is edited. What happened to the guitar solo, free jazz sax and the intense screaming that round out the song? I have an mp3 from the original record and it is life changing."
3,Just Fair.,"This EMI reissue features a very young violinist Sarah Chang in a 1992 performance. Joined by the LSO under Sir Colin Davis,this recording is a reliable though uninspiring choice for listeners. At this point in her early career, Chang was more thancapable of easily tackling the technical demands of the concerto. This is not the real problem here. Her musical interpretationis far less seasoned and mature than her more recent readings. In this recording, the outer movements in particular are safe but absolutely unoriginal. The Finale, perhaps following a tempo giusto, lacks the dazzling pyrotechnics of others like Kennedy,Josefowicz or Vengerov who make this concerto such a crowd more enjoyable. In summary, just a fair performance, perfectlydispensable once you have in your collection a Heifetz, a Stern and a Milstein."
3,Immature,"I listened to this CD on radio. It was Violin Concerto of Tchaikovsky. Sarah Chang seems to have enough techniques but I didn't like her performance. This is dynamic for sure but very immature and not sensitive at all. Cheesy. On the other hand, Orchestra was quite good."
5,Dictionary of Eye Terminology,The book arrived right on time and it was in great shape. Coulnt have been more pleased. I would certainly buy books here again.
4,Yoga Zone CD's,"I heard from my Yoga instructor that these CD's were great and they are. In the four set series, I've used the relaxation CD and unfortunately, it did stall for about a minute. That is why I didn't give it five stars. If the supplier would like to send me just that one (I think there were four in the set) that would be great."
4,Is a real orientation,"I think is a good book, it has real orientation since the autor take their own experience."
2,A western fan.,"Maybe its just bad luck on my part, but I ordered this dvd twice and approximately at the 46 minute mark, both dvd had the picture break up for approximately 2 minutes.I'm talking about the one produced by Roan."
3,Sturdy Western,"This is a sturdy western featuring beautiful color photography, and an interesting character study. Burt Lancaster plays a stolid, depedable foster son who reluctantly has to face down his reckless foster brother played by Robert Walker. Walker and Lancaster play off each other well, their naturally opposing acting styles heightning the conflict between these two. Unfortunately, Robert Walker, who made quite an impression in his short film career -- especially in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" -- would be dead shortly after this film was released. A sad footnote to an overlooked but interesting film."
4,Good for pack pre-school,"Beautiful color and the lids are great. My child loves the idea of plate of his own and the independence. The two plates with sections are very good for packing pre-school lunch: 1 part protein, 1 part veggies and 1 part starch. My child's pre-school teachers really love it."
5,Black Rebellion five Slave Revolts,This was a very good book. Some people just don't know the horrors of slavery and what slave would do to become free.
5,Great book to have on hand,This is a great read. I have learned so much that I never knew and recommend all to read this book.
5,Higginson - Magnificent Activist,"I am yet again amazed at the sheer audacity of this man, Thomas Wentworth Higginson; a history of slave rebellions!Not only was this man instrumental in getting Emily Dickinson's poems published, many of his, not Shaw's, observations are included in the film, 'Glory.'To be introduced to the scope of this man, see, 'Magnificent Activist,' by Meyer.If we can manifest only 10% of his intellectual and physical courage, we will be blessed."
4,"Keaton talks, Durante sings","Niche market DVD purveyor RCF's dubs are ""best available source,"" with quality that varies from only fair to very good.In SPEAK EASILY, MGM's comedy star transition from Buster Keaton to Jimmy Durante begins, yet here Keaton holds his own as a lonely college professor, who, believing he's inherited $750K, invests in a crummy stageshow and takes it to Broadway.The last 20 mnutes equal the finale ofA NIGHT AT THE OPERA(1935) for zaniness, with Buster showing considerable acrobatic skills as his Professor keeps going onstage during premiere night and messing things up, much to the delight of the audience. Jimmy sings a few lines from his signature piece, ""Can Broadway Do Without Me?""It's a must-see for Keaton fans.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.9) Speak Easily (1932) - Buster Keaton/Jimmy Durante/Ruth Selwyn/Thelma Todd/Hedda Hopper/Sidney Toler/Henry Armetta/Edward Brophy (uncredited: Dave O'Brien)"
2,"True, yet partial","Daryl Paulson's book is the first foray into the integration of interal theory with business theory. For those business professionals without a background in Ken Wilber's work (or without an interest in reading some rather lengthy and complex material), this book is a fine starting point for basic integral ideas (not so much for practice).Paulson presents Wilber's integral theory in an easy to understand way. Onto that Paulson builds a hierarchy of organizational levels using Wilber's AQAL matrix. Popular business theory and practice is then categorized within the four quadrants and across the organizational levels. The result is a typology of common practice within an integral framework. That's as far as it goes.For business practitioners possessing knowledge and experience with Wilber's integral model, this book has little to offer."
5,So good!,"Fantastic band! singer James Grant, vocals are excellent. However each of the bands album's after 'strange kind of love' ,seemed to get slower, more moody and dark, more country in style and more obscure. One of James Grant's solo album's, 'sawdust in my veins 'put out after they split, was a disapointment, although it contained a few highlight tracks . He has some other solo projects which you can get through some scottish music sites and itunes. I havn't heard these .For me, the Steely Dan sound & style of Gary Katz's production on 'strange kind of love', is great it just rocks out more with these really cool jams & jazzy back beats...just an ace album and definite desert island disc. On this album/greatest hits, the track, 'who in their right mind' only on this album, is the standout & perhaps worth getting this compilation for the track, although you can download this track alone on itunes ."
5,McHale's Navy - Season One,"We bought this for my Dad for Christmas this year. It is his favorite gift of all. When I was little, I always watched McHale's Navy with him. My Mom didn't dare put supper on the table until the show was over! I would recommend this to anyone who has great memories of shows from long ago."
3,Nostalgia Entertains Baby-Boomers,"I purchased McHale's Navy for a Father - Son Cub Scout sleep over on an historic Navy Ship (that had an entertainment space with DVD player). Most kids lasted three or four shows before getting bored. The fathers stayed longer. Was a hit with a few kids, but not those jaded by hyper-special effects. The fathers enjoyed it as a happy bit of nostalgia (I mean, who can't get a kick out watching the grinning Ernest Borgnine water skiing behind a PT Boat?)."
5,EXCELLENT VIDEO QUALITY,"I just finished watching the complete McHale's Navy season 1 DVD and am now submitting my review. The video quality is excellent and the format of the dvd, i.e. access to individual episodes, is easy. I'm not going to comment on the show itself because that is subjective as if you enjoyed Mchale's Navy before you'll like this dvd and vice-versa. The dvd was shipped on a timely basis and in superb condition. I would most definitely recommend this dvd/product."
1,McHale's Navy Season One,"The shows are good, however to have to endure a solid five minute advertisment is beyond our endurance. If we wanted to order ""That Girl"", ""I Spy"", etc we would NOT order from this company. Each and every time we want to watch a thirty minute McHale's Navy we have to grit our teeth for five minutes. Cannot speed up, or get around it."
5,Worth waiting for.,"This is such a fun collection. Brings me back to simpler days, when TV shows were decent and funny, without the gratuitous sarcasm and sniping found in most programs today. Watching these episodes helps to put one in a good mood. I'd forgotten how funny Captain Binghamton is, and it's fun to watch Tim Conway in his days before the Carol Burnett Show. The DVDs themselves are of excellent quality. We are thoroughly enjoying this box set and I hope the rest of the seasons come out soon."
2,Not as goog as it could have been,"I just got Season One of McHale's Navy on DVD. The DVD has not been remastered - I should have known that! The transfer is grainy, the sound is a little tinny, and the producers of the DVD make you sit thru all the ads they want you to see for their other products before the McHale's Navy episodes start - you can't fast-forward and skip the advertisements.But the jokes are still funny and the show reminds me of the good old days...I have F-Troop Season One and Hogan's Heroes Season 2, and that's the way it's supposed to be done! From now on I will not buy classic TV that hasn't been remastered."
1,McHales Navy,Very Disappointed that it is not close captioned so I am unable to watch it and enjoy this series.
5,Classic Comedy uncut on DVD,"McHale's Navy was a classic piece of Television. Done in 1962-1963, this first season showed the comedy like Operation Peticoat did for the movies.Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine is Quinton McHale. Tim Conway (Pre-Carol Burnett or Disney movies) was the bumbling Charles Parker. Joe Flynn showcased what he did later for Disney films and embodied Captain Binghamton. The supporting cast included Gavin McLeod (long before the Love Boat), Magician Carl Ballingtine and Bob Hastings (Gordon on Batman the Animated Seroes)When this classic comedy works, the laughes are freeflowing..and it works many many times over. Over 36 episodes, done in glorous Black & White, the DVD collection is total enjoyableM*A*S*H was a great show which was a combo of comedy and drama. This show took the drama out of the war and just made you laugh..and its what comedy is meant toBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,Taking you back to the good old days,"Anyone who spent most of their childhood in the 1970's will truly apprciate Crooklyn. I related to everything in this film. From buying candy at the corner store, watching the Partridge Family and going to visit relative down South. Spike Lee truly makes you think an appreciate your youth."
4,Crooklyn DVD,This movie is one of my favorites and I'm glad I was able to find it here to add to my collection. I recommend purchases from this buyer!
3,Pretty Good but not among his Strongest,Delroy Lindo&Zelda Harris Steal The Movie.Alfre Woodard is Good in this Film About Middle-Class African-American Family Life in the 70's.The Music feels So Good to the Soul&the Vibe is their.but after a while much was the un-doing of Girl 6 is the same with this film the Music goes from going with the film to being One Long Video to Great 70's music.
5,THE BEST OF ALL TIMES,"This movie is the most wonderful thing I've ever seen! It takes me to a time and place that my parents and brother often spoke about. It moves me to tears and laughter. It's my personal favorite- and if pop culture got a hold of it, I'm sure they'd feel the same."
3,I dont remember the movie being this boring,I loved this movie hen I was younger. Thats why I purchased it. The movie got very boring at times.
1,A realistic review,"This movie has no point. It is a series of random events that sometime relate to one another. The acting was descent, but the lack of plot nd story made the movie annoying to watch. You will find yourself waiting for the movie to end and then wishing for it to do so."
1,APN,This movie is wack.Spike was probably really sniffing glue when he directed this movie.Spike next time do not sniff.(u must smoke boodah). PEACE
5,BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY YOU TH,GREAT NOSTALGIA MOVIE BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY YOUTH WHEN EVERYONE SEEMED SAFE AND LIFE WAS NOTHING BUT GETTING OUT ON THE STREET WITH YOUR FRIENDS. 99 PERCENT OF GAMES WE PLAYED WERE COSTLESS AN OLD CLOTHESLINE FOR JUMP ROPE - A STOOP AND A BALL -- YOUR FEET FOR RUNNING BY DINNER TIME YOU WERE EXHAUSTED EVERYONE WATCHED OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
1,wrong disc in case,i went to watch this movie and its in full screen but the case says widescreen. i would like the rickt disc
5,GREAT FAMILY MOVIE WITH A MEANING TO IT.,"I love this movie, and i watched it once when i was a little girl and loved it ever since. When i got older, i found it in the store and still been my favorite movie. It has a 70s theme to it, the clothes, music is great. Another good movie from Spike Lee. Now my daughter loves it and she is 6 yrs old. Im so excited because its a good family movie with a good outlook on how my heritage use to be and my daugter can enjoy it. Please buy if you want a good family movie. Its also emotional too which brung the movie all together. Great movie is all i can say."
5,GREAT MOVIE,IT'S A FUNNY& GREAT MOVIE. IT SHOWED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING I NEW YORK VERSUS VISITING VIRGINIA. I CAN'T EXPLAIN THE REST.
4,Great performances,"This is one of the most overlooked films of recent memory. No one mentions what a great performance Zelda Harris delivers. If Tatum O'Neal can get an Oscar for Paper Moon, then this child certainly deserved at least a nomination. Alfre can do no wrong in my book. A very tender and heartfelt movie - for the whole family, regardless of your ethnic background."
5,A Family Favorite,"This movie is a cult favorite in my family. I've never lived in NYC, but really enjoy the way this movie makes me feel. It reminds me of the 70's and growing up in a ""family"". Nobody's perfect, and lord knows we fight, but at the end of the day we all love one another. I believe this to be the best Spike Lee movie and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie on a Saturday afternoon. You will probably cry, though."
4,Exactly what it says it is,"I'll start with a preface: I have been playing piano for four years, I started when I was 18, and aside from six one-unit community college classes, I've never had any formal training. That said, this book is (in my opinion) a little tougher than the first ""First Lessons in Bach"" book and at the end is still easier than most of the second ""First Lessons"" Bach book. It fits squarely in the middle, which would be a good run up towards Schumann's Album Für Die Jugend or a book of Bach's inventions.Also it would be useful for an accomplished pianist to run through these as one would Hanon or Czerny, only these are actual songs, which helps to break up the monotony of finger exercises. Not to say Hanon or Czerny aren't important; diversity is simply a good thing to have.I'm a total amateur, and I was looking for something less intense than Bach, less repititious than Hanon, and less insane than Czerny. Burgmüllers Twenty-Five Easy and Progressive Studes fits the bill nicely."
3,Music is great but the print is not,"I shouldn't have skimped on a few dollars. I should have ordered the slightly more expensive version of this. The print is not very crisp. In fact, I would say a couple of pages the print is rather faded. Hard on the eyes! So I don't recommend getting this version."
5,Pope John Paul II - The Movie,"This movie was extremely inspirational. I so enjoyed it! It covers a full span of the Holy Father's life from boyhood to adulthood. The story line shows the Pope's humaness, his intellect, and his great love of God. It also revealed the struggles and strength of the Polish people during World War II. I have recommended it to friends who have equally enjoyed it."
4,The Best of OMD,"The Best of OMD is an amazing compilation from 1988 and includes such hits as Enola Gay, If you leave , Joan of Arc and many many more. This is definitely a nostalgia trip for me as I remember listening to them growing up in the 80's. The booklet is quite spartan but contains many nice photographs of the band and all the covers for the singles. 4/5."
5,Amusing music XD,"I bought this cd because I heard the song If You Leave on the radio. And guess what? The cds surprised me because its so good. I love 80's music, especially new wave 80's songs, so this cd was definatly worth it. The music is amusing at times, and you can definatly tell that its from the 80's. The instruments are very beautiful, and its more outdone with the instruments and doesn't just focus on the song mostly, like a lot of music does now. Either way, I really liked the cd. -^_________^- I hope my random rambling review is helpful to some people. If not, sorry, I'm not good at this. -_-'"
3,"Not great, not bad","This album is way overhyped. but it has some tyte beats and songs, but will not compare to Get Rich or Die Trying.peace niggaz"
1,50 is everything that is wrong with our society,I truly wish that 50 Cent's crack-head Mama had an abortion!
2,damn 50.,"Its not worth buying. this is exactly why people bootleg cds. dont get me wrong, there are some songs that i would defenitly bump in the jeep, but like i said there are some...and there are about 20+ songs on this cd. I like a cd i can listen to all the way thru instead of skipping thru trax. If your looking for a good cd go grab The Games new sh*t... nicely done. Thats a cd I ""actually"" bought. im going to be honest with you. just download the new 50"
1,WHY DOES HE SELL SO DAMN MUCH,I personally dont find 50 cent to be a good rapper there are many more BETTER than him i dotn see 50 stayin in the game 10 albums deep THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE not even worth a penny let alone 50 dasmn cents
2,MORE LIKE 40 CENT,We're all lemmings I guess. Another case in point about how powerful the media is and how you can be so average and sell so hugely. I'm out............
1,Pathetic...,"This is very bad. He loves 2 diss people on this album. He disses Fat Joe, Jadakiss (just because they went and did ""New York"" with Ja Rule, and Nas! He is WAY better than 50 and he knows it. If 2pac and Biggie were alive today, he would diss them 2. Soon, he will diss Eminem. This is a terrible album. Not recommended."
2,Not good,first off 50 cent is the most overrated artist in the buisness. His lyrics suck and his voice sounds really dumb (because he got shot in the mouth a few years back and has a hole in his mouth.)Instead of listing all the crappy tracks i'll tell u the only decent ones.Gunz come outi don't need emHate it or love it remix (probably my favorite song now but this is games song and he just redid it with the rest of g unit)overall crappy cd don't buy it
1,Crazy!,"Basically all what 50 does is diss nas,jadakiss, fat joe, and especially ja rule. the beats are ok but the lyrics suck. I waited 4 ever for this album to come out when I first bought I was excited but now I dont even want to look at it!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
1,Someone Tell me,"After 2 years, and 60 songs, how... JUST HOW?!?!?!?! can this album be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad? can these really be the best songs he can pick out of 60?!?!?! Someone get Jimmy Ivine on the phone, somethings gotta change...."
2,LYRICALLY INCOMPETENT,"Okay Just listened to 50 cent album the ""massacre."" The album had a few nice beats Candyshop of course with the help of Olivia, Disco Inferno and Gatman And Robin (without lyrics) are songs with nice tracks they are the best of all the songs on the album. But this is a weak LYRICALLY INCOMPETENT album. Nothing special and the piggy bank song is the worst Diss song ever made and to diss Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Shine, Nas and other rap elite's He should have thought about something else to say and a better beat. And to say that The Game album was his so he 50 cent say should have kept it for himself cause The Game album is 1000 times better."
1,Pitiful,I am very disappointed with this album. There are a few good songs but they are far and few in between. this album is nowhere as good as the first album. The Game's album is a hell of lot better than 50's effort. 50 step your game back up for the next album or lose more fans!
1,rap is without a doubt the worst way to waist your life,"50 cent, you scumbag, you don't even deserve a review."
1,Disturbing To The Ear,"Why do we need a fake thug steroid image in the industry to sell records. This man has no talent whatsoever. His first cd was alright but The Massacre was one of the worst albums of all time next to Eddie Murphy's album. Hear we have a man that look like he just injected himself with Arnold Swarzneggar steroids talking about ""Candy Shop"" and ""Disco Inferno"" what's next for this Uncle Tom? Are we going to see him dancing for the President in a pink bikini suit? For the right price he'll be there."
1,ALL THAT HYPE,22 SONGS ABOUT FIVE SONGS I CAN BUMPWEEEEEK UNIT!!!!!!!!WHAT THE HELL IS THE GATMAN SONG
1,SUCKS!,All rap sucks especially 50 cents. Go listen to real music this is a joke. If I could give negative stars I would.
3,It's Business,"It's not a bad album compared to some of the trash that is out there now. What people have to realize is that 50 is a business man so he is gonna make music that sells and also create enough buzz where even if the music isnt that great people will buy the album. In regards to his beef with almost everybody in the rap game, who really cares. Like I said, that is all part of his marketting campaign. But no one can deny that 50's music is catchy and rocks in a car so for that its worth a listen. Its a shame that we have to rationalize rap music like this nowadays.-Mooch"
1,50 is solid but this CD is complete garbage,I have no problem with 50 cent. I enjoy most of his work from his beginnings on the 8 mile soundtrack to get rich. But this is crap. How about some NEW lyrics instead of g-unit and gats? The beats are junk compared to his last cd and it lacks any continuity at all. Do yourself a favor and check out Jadakiss or Obie Trice. They blow this clown away lyrically.
1,50 cent. I'll give him a dollar to shut up,"this could very possiby be one of the worst albums ever. sad but true. i mean every damn song on here is about the same damn thing murder,sex,money. yeah, not very creative i would say. Why won't he just quit or go and get shot. He is a big reason why hip hop is going down the drain.I don't know if people like Kanye and Nas will be enough to save rap if no talent ass clowns like 50 keep coming in the game."
3,Not as good as get rich and die trying,"Ok people, its obvious that this cd is not as good as get rich and die trying and to be honest with you is just a average cd.Piggy Bank, Get in my car are good songs but the others lack lyrics and good beats all in all take it as a lost and work on new material."
2,Huge let down! Not what i expected,"I have now had this ablum for 3 days I give it 2 1/2 stars (yes I may have iilegally got it but who cares) and its not what i expected at all. There are 22 tracks on this CD i liked 5: 1. ""this is 50"" 2. ""Im suppose to die tonight"" 3. ""Just a little bit"" 4. ""Candy Shop"" 5. ""Disco Inferno"" some tracks are starting to grow on me but not worth mentioning. Overall this album is not worth the price i would not buy it!!! He needs to get off ja rule and work on is own stuff. i am a huge g unit fan but this was the worse cd g unit has put out hands down. You may need to go get The Documentary since i few of 50 songs got but on The Games album. But before you review it I would suggest you listen to it a few times, because it is no a cd you may like the first time you hear it!"
3,"Better then ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'""","As a Hip Hop head, I really don't favor all of that pop bullsh*t that cats like 50 Cent put out. ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" was horrible. Everything from the production, lyrics, concepts, and guest appearances was just horrible. As an open minded individual, I gave 50 another chance and downloaded ""The Massacre"", his sophomore LP, as soon as it was leaked on the net. The first listen was not that good. Then I burned it on CD and played it in my CD player on the way to school, and I started feeling more tracks. ""Piggy Bank"" seems to be the CD's strongest cut. Of course Nas, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Shyne, and the rest of the world is going to eat him alive, but he came nice with ""Piggy Bank"".The Strongest tracks on the albums seem to be:""Piggy Bank""""In My Hood""""Baltimore Love Thing""""God Gave Me Style""""Position Of Power""""So Amazing""Although it's a nice album, it's not more then average. 50 Cent suprised me with this one. 3.5 stars.~1~"
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible terrible, terrible.","The above is an understatement.What the hell is wrong with 50? 'Disco Inferno'? 'Candy Shop'? 'Gatman and Robin'? This whole album is total crap, do NOT waste any resources on this garbage. If you enjoy this music then you have probably been drugged beyond repair from his vitamin water and crappy clothing."
1,50 is a joke.,"Rap today is so bad. The golden year of the early to mid 90's are all gone. Now it's ""I drilled a ho and smoked some dope and shot some guys and went to the candy shop."" God help rap. I wish I could just play some classic Eric B. and Rakim, Gang Starr, Brand Nubian, TCQ, etc., then you would hear what real rap and hip-hop was. My sister keeps bragging about how great this CD is and I just have to pop in ""Don't Sweat the Technique or Midnight Marauders"" to show her what rap is. Rap sucks today. 50 Cent is the today's rap king(why?) and he is leading it into the ground. Heis absolutely killing it. That's just too bad. Mainstream rap is pure garbage."
1,DI Hova WTF,what are you talking about. Nas and Jadakiss will murder this clown. Nas probally has more money then 50 Cents because 50 probally flushed it down the tank. I am sorry for doing this DI but this review by you was kind of nuts. How about like me you review the other CD off the album and not the biacies.
1,Garbage,"This Cd iz horrible. 50 is a horrible rapper, he is a fake gangster who never touched a gun and uses his corny gimmic of gettin shot to try to make him sound like pac. Rap iz getting worse and worse. If u r a true hip-hop fan go buy and support the underground or the decent mainstream rappers. 50 cent cant even flow, his lyrics are corny and very uncreative, just look at him compared to other rappers. 50cent:I pop you punk N****s, like I pop my collar"" Big L: Hopped in the lincoln, left em stinkin, wit his brains in the street and you can see what he was just thinkin. /50Cent:I take you to the candy shop, u can lick the lollypop. Immortal Technique: Soobviously I'm not gonna be here to play games, Walk the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames, Battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James. See My Point."
5,Great but Not Quite as Good As His Last,"There is no doubt that this album isn't as good as Get Rich or Die Tryin' but this is the best album so far this year. Here is my rating.In My Hood - 5/5 Great Opening TrackThis is 50 - 4.5/5I'm Suppose to Die tonight - 4.5/5 Another Great Em ProductionPiggy Bank - 4/5 Good Diss SongGatman and Robbin - 5/5 Another Great 50, Em connectionCandy Shop - 5/5 You've heard ItOutta Control - 4/5 Great BeatGet in My Car - 5/5Ski Mask Way - 5/5A Baltimore Love Thing 3/5Ryder Music - 4/5Disco Inferno - 5/5Just a Lil Bit - 3.5/5Gunz Come Out - 3/5My Toy Soldier - 5/5 Tied for the Best Track on the AlbumPosition of Power 4/5Build You Up - 4.5/5 Jamie Foxx Is Good On The TrackGod Gave Me Style - 5/5So Amazing - 4/5I Don't Need Em 3/5Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix) 5/5 Tied For Best Track On The Album To My Suprise Buck and Yayo Kill on This Track 50 Basically Spits the Same thing as in the actual song"
1,Garbage! Don't Buy!! This Happens When People Get $!!!,"I loved ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"" and I thought 50 was gonna better himself as a rapper, but as we see, money has gotten the best of him. We see this all the time in the music business. So for anybody who doesn't have a clue on how to buy good music, don't expect somebody's second album to be better than their first. And one more thing for those who bought this album, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET AND LISTEN TO ALBUMS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!"
2,Game Over,"It is too bad 50 had to let the Game go, the Game and him worked so well together and it made for a better album in The Documentary than 50 could do alone with The Massacre. I knew 50 was in trouble when his first two singles were remakes of Loyd Banks On Fire and Lil Kim's Magic Stick and the rest of the album doesnt even live up to those tracks. Piggy Bank and Gunz come out are ""B"" rated tracks and the rest are all down hill from there. Some of 50's best tracks on his last album came from the help of Eminem (patiently waiting) and Nate Dog (21 questions). Add this to the success of How We Do and Hate it or Love it where he was the Games sidekick and it becomes obvious that 50 does his best work along side other talents. Its too bad only a handful of tracks are set up this way on the Massacure. Plus... Nas? I believe someone's boss once rapped ""It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outkast,Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me""....not smart to upset the ones that the boss respects"
2,I cant give 50 a 1 but his cockyness is unheard of.,"From a commercial ""pop"" rap album this is good. But that is it. The lyrics are a far cry from his first album and even the hooks are horrible. Candy Shop has to be one of the worst singles of the year. 50's said if he sold one album less than he did on his first album it was a failure. Well this looks to be a failure. The b.s. beef with Nas is incredibly stupid on 50s part. Nas is a legend. Nas makes rap, hip hop music; not commercial pop records. 50 can sell his millions to the youth of the nation who have no idea what rap is and only listen to it to look cool. If you wanna hear real hip hop pick up anything Nas or either of Talib Kweli's records. Even better Snoop Doggs Death Row greatest hits. 50 doenst deserve my $15."
2,ha,"i liked get rich or die trying- it had some great beats and i could listen all the way through it without skipping a track and the guest vocals from eminem are good and g unit are ok,although this album is a lot worse and i think it is a bit half as*ed and there are no really memorable tracks on here, i still think there are a few alright tracks on here, and you can't base how you feel about a whole album on only hearing a few tracks. p.s haha trevor your review didn't get showed you forgot to blank out c**p."
5,50 Cent's Back & Strong and Better Than Ever,"50's new album may cause some controversey but it's definetly a keeper. The album was right on target, I bought it the first day of release. I think the tracks/singles taken off the album, already may boost the sales of the album and then, again it may not. Either way 50's still going to be on top and it looks like it's going to be that way for a long, long time. No matter how old he gets he has my money, for he's a talented thug with potential and power."
2,Ok CD...not worth buying. nowhere near get rich or die tryin,the massacre is ok...nothin more nothin less. when i put it in i find myself constantly switching tracks and repeating the same 4 or 5 songs. with get rich you can pop it in and not skip one song....every track was a hit. i was really disappointed with the massacre. he didnt show anything with this record that showed he deserves to be a multi platinum selling repper. i expected much more with all the hype that was built up. get rich is def. in my top 3 fav cd'sget back in the studio 50
2,This wasn't worth 50 cents,"Im a true and true g-unit fan. been to the concerts, buy the cds, not just the ones you can buy in kmart. im talking about underground stuff, g-unit radio. i woke up on march 3rd at 8:30 am so i could be one of the first in the store to purchase the massacre. i had looked at the cover and was dissappointed a week before on amazon.com and could only hope that the tracks on the cd wouldn't disappoint me like the cover. i popped it in my car cd player as soon as i got in. i had a frown on my face until track 5 which is piggy bank. and unlike GRODT i had no expression on my face for the rest of the cd. this is a cd that i will burn with the 4 or 5 tracks that i really like and the rest can be thrown in the garbage. im a sad g-unit fan, i can only sit and wait for the new g-unit cd and hope that its not trash like this one!"
2,Weak lyrical skills + decent production = $.50,"Firstly, I wouldn't burn a bootlegged copy of this album on a stolen CDR. Yes, that's how bad it is! Some say his rapping style sounds like he's out of breath or that it's due to the bullets he took. Whatever it is, it does not work. 50 raps without ANY emotion.In every other ""song"", sounds of guns being cocked and bullets being fired attempt to present 50 as being hard. Yet, the only thing that's hard is being able to sit through all the tracks of this garbage.While listening to him, I await him to stumble over his words. Listen closely and you can hear his speech slow as he pronounces words with three or more syllables. Seriously, he sounds like he's learning to read for the first time-slowly pronouncing every word. Save your money on this one folks."
3,Didn't live up to hype.,"I was expecting worse from this album, but it was better than I expected. With that said, it's still an average record. Nothing special, but it's also not the worst thing as most people are saying."
1,LOL,"lol. I'm laughing so hard... I do so dearly hate this album... Oh and by the way, incase you where to stupid to notice, he has no musical talent and is obsessed with killing people. Yo 50! I got a little rap for you my friend!yo, yo, im 50 centmy face is ugly and it's full of crapPeople try to shoot me,I wonder why?maybe it's because I'm dumb and I don;t know why...son... I try so hard, but my rhyms just blowI have no flow! so buy my album,son....and you'll waste 10 dollars whoopie what fun!LOL! funny stuff.... I wouldn't pay 50 cents for it!"
2,50 Cent sucks,"When i got this cd i listined 2 it like about liek a month then i stoped cuz it got boring then i relized tht he talks about sex and himself most of the time. the only rapper tht i like is eminem cuz he doesnt talk about himself all the damn time. And since eminem is on this tht the only reason tht it gets a 1 star review. If u want 2 listin 2 music, listin 2 Rock N' Roll"
2,Big step down,"Massacre feels like a commercial rehash of the excellent Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Not any memorable songs on this album and the lyrics are brain-dead. The beats are rotten for the most part. There are a few stand-out songs, but looking at the album compared to 50's previous album and even other G-Unit albums this is a huge step backward.Reccomended songs: I'm Supposed to Die Tonight, Gunz come Out, My Toy Soldiers (feat Tony Yayo), Hate it or Love It Remix"
2,HE'S THE REASON FOR HIP HOP'S DEATH!!!,"im not goin lie....anyone can get caught up in some hype.and i was a victim of 50 cent's hype with his first album.if you want to listen to some nice dre beats, nice catchy hooks, and like to hear about someone rapping about how much times they got shot then go cop get rich or die tryin....and now this sophmore album ""the massacre""..i knew he was goin sell just cuz of his name not cuz of the talent or lyrics and he had to be stupid to come at jadakiss or anybody in dblock..this cat cant even hang with fat joe and latest news is hes thinking bout comin at the right now incarcerated cassidy.well all i gotta say is good luck!!!OH YEAH, THE ALBUM IS GARBAGE!!!LOL"
1,Dont...,"Dont buy this. I burnt it from a friend and, I only like 1 song out of the whole cd and thats ""Hate it or Love it"". I really like that song but other than that the cd is garbage. Use your money to buy a good cd."
1,I agree with DukeOfEarl.,"50 Cent is a disgrace to rap, and to music in general.SIDE NOTE:Metal_gangsta, YOU are the complete idiot. You say G-Unit is awesome, Public Enemy sucks, and call Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park metal. You better be kidding! PE are possibly the best rap group of all time! G-Unit sucks! And for calling LP and LB metal, go buy a copy of Cephalic Carnage's ""Anomalies"" and think those two bands are metal! And hwile you're at it, buy a copy of Public Enemy's ""Fear of a Black Planet"".With the side note being said, DukeOfEarl is right. 50 Cent has got to be the most overrated rapper of all time! I could listen to this, but I'd rather do something less painful, like papercutting my eye. For good rap, listen to Public Enemy, N.W.A., KRS-One, Nas, The Roots, Jurassic 5, Beastie Boys, etc. Just let this ""CD"" rot on the shelves."
1,Piece of Sh*t,This cd is the worst i have ever heard there r only a couple songs that r decent do not buy this garbage you will be waisting your hard earned money on this i did. If u want 50 get his Get rich or die trying album way better than this. Thats all I gotta say about this!
1,No-brainer.,"This isn't music, this is a product. It tries to sell itself with cheap commercial tactics/lyrics, and it isn't worth a minute of your time. 50 cent is an insult to the word ""musician"", ""artist"" or anything or the sort. I don't even got to have good taste to hate this."
1,Fifty be juicin',"come on people...look at the album cover, its a hood-rich version of the HULK...50 obviously gave in to the demands of the mainstream and is lovin it, as hes pleasin plenty of 40 year old real-estater's (alongwith their wives), and clueless 13 year old's who claim 50 is a lyrical genious....be real people.-rbsambo"
1,DANE,50 CENT CD IS THE WORST HE DIDN'T CHANGED HIS STYLE AT ALL IN HIS MUSIC.THE BEATS ON THE ALBUM AREN'T BAD BUT HE SHOULD STOP SINGING AND RAP ABOUT SOMETHING HE REALLY FEELS INSTEAD OF TALKING DOWN ABOUT OTHER ARTIST.THE SONG HE HAS OUT NOW WITH MOBB DEEP ISN'T BAD BUT HE NEEDS STOP THINKING HIS THE SH*T AND STEP HIS GAME UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,One of the year's worst album,"50 Cent is another weak emcee of mainstream rap. The beats shine yet his lyrics lack any thought. No need to go in the details of the tracks because there is nothing special about any one. 50 Cent had his good days in the past, but now he just releases garbage. Pickup Common, Canibus, Jedi Mind Tricks, some intelligent rappers -- don't waste your money on this brainless rapper's album."
1,100% Pure Garbage,"This CD is by far the worst piece of s**t that I have ever had the misfortune to let grace my presence. This has to be the worst thing to happen to rap since Vanilla Ice. This guy has no ""flow"", no sense of rhyme or rhythm, and on top of it, I don't think he comprehends English very well. I truly believe that I could take a s**t, record it and burn it to a CD, and have it mean than this load of garbage that he tries to pass of as an album. It is quite obvious that he is only in the industry for the money, and when an artist is motivated by nothing more that greed and self satisfaction, then there is no good that can possibly be attributed to their work, if you can call it work."
5,Gettin Rich,"i think that the Massacre is better than Get Rich. the beats were better. also most songs are better then the Get Rich. however, i do see so bad parts in this album. some of the lyrics are weak. i was like what the heck is a gangsta sayin somethin like that for. but like i said, for the most part, this is better then Get Rich. Baltimore Love Thing is prolly my favorite. i lile all the songs but like 1 or 2, but i don't hate them. 50 Cent is tight, but the only thing that i wanted to see was more of Eminem's hands in The Massacre."
4,THE MASSACRE,This is not better than the Get rich or die tryin' album but it is still good. If you are a 50 cent fan you should pick it up. I recommend it.
1,stop mumbling 50,"This album is sooo terrible, it sounds like a remix of his first cd, with some shots at nas, jadakiss, and fatjoe, among others, this cd blows, ive heard about you gettting shot a hundred times fifty, i dont care if you got a bunch of money and cars, so do another hundred million rappers, go back into the studio and get some lyrical content, or go get shot again and die, the only good thing i could see on this record were his beats, some of the beats were pretty good, but oh wait 50 doesnt make those, so 50 you pretty much suck."
3,Alright,"I thought the cd was alright, like other people said it seems like he talkin more about killin ya with his 50 different weapons, but dat shiet was funny"
1,I Wanna Die Tonight After listenin to This~~,"This CD aint even worth buying, it aint even worth burning this has to be the worse CD i ever heard in my life, he has lost all his rap he should of retired after the first CD cause this one is junk he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss on Piggy Bank what a dumb @$$ like they didnt even have any beef with this @$$ clown Jada is so gonna tear him apart im waiting, and then this thing happens with him and Game like this boy fiddy needs some serious help the steroids are wearing his brain down like fat joe says in XXL. Wait til All or Nothing by Fat Joe Drops yo'all be busting to that cd its well worth a buy but Fiddy's Massacre sure is a massacre to listen to."
3,Where's the Massacre?,"I Ain't the type to hate but i don't like this dude I don't respect this dude Ja Rule's over this Rappin Body Builder but the CD ain't bad though Word of Damn advice to the whole camp keep Olivia of yall CD's who put her in the G-unit? OVERALL the production Hot, Lyrics are not hooder than GRODT but straight The only thing keeping it from a 5 is where yo squad at?"
2,Well....,"This CD was way over hyped by 50 himself. There's a couple of gems on this cd, but for the most part, it's a whole lot of filler. The good songs are just that: good. The rest I think was a dissapointment.Best songs:Ski Mask WayJust a Little BitThat's it"
5,STOP HATING,"Don't listen to these people hating on 50 cent. He was underground for years and now that he sees some success, everybody and their mother wants to hate on his artistry. He is a great artist that writes catchy choruses. Although he has definitely dumbed down his lyrics for his radio hits, one must remember that he used to ghost write for many artists in the past and has an arsenal of underground hits under his belt. Aside from his radio hits, there are a bunch of great tracks on this album; for instance, Baltimore Love Song and God Gave Me Style. Both of those songs are worthy of some praise atleast, even from the harshest critics. So please people, let the man live. Don't just give him 1 star just because you hate his success.."
1,just...awful,"well,all i can say is that this is NOT his best work. I'd rather listen to chingy or fat joe. If you're looking for some good 50 cent, then i highly reccomend you get ""Guess Who's Back?"". Heck, even ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"" tryin was better then this garbage."
5,Forget The HATERS,"this cd is wat its about, all the people that dont think so are just messed. The Best songs on the cd are:1. Im Suppose 2 Die 2night2. My Toy Soldier ft. Tony Yayo3. Ski Mask Way4. Gatman and Robin ft. Eminem5. Get In My CarI like all the songs so for all the haters go pick up some Ja Rule hes just like you"
2,Not so hot,50 Cent only has a three good songs on here. I was very disappointed when I purchased this album. 50 Cent needs to stop trying to make his own beats. He needs to let Eminem & Dr. Dre produce all of his beats until he gets the hang of it. I hope the next aftermath cd is better than this.
3,disapointed,"I am left disapointed after listening to this cd, after Candy shop and Disco Inferno the rest of the songs on this album sound like remixes to the songs I mentioned before. Maybe I am old fashioned but I would like to have some lyrical content and fifty lyricaly is no where in the same league as Nas JayZ Jada or even Luda. The Album will proberly sell like bananas but personaly i wouldnt be surprised if 50 Cent albums after this will see lower sales, I meen unless he starts a beef with Eminem the only other rapper in his pop appeal catagory, who would blow him away lyricaly, then he has out lived all his hype."
3,Here's the reality:,"This CD isn't even out yet you morons. All these supposed haters need to get a life, because they obviously illegally downloaded the album (would you do that to get music from an artist you hate...?), if they listened to it at all. People frivolously giving this 1 star have been 50 Cent haters since the beginning, it's highly unlikely they've even listened to the album. And the people rapidly giving it 5 stars have been 50 Cent-obsessed since the beginning. Due to the fact that THIS CD HASN'T EVEN BEEN RELEASED YET, not a single review here will give you a good idea of what the album is like-I've checked, songs aren't even mentioned-it's all 'I love 50!' or '50 sucks!' They may, however, give you a good idea of the reviewer's personality. If you want to read a review of the actual CD (or review it yourself), I'd recommend WAITING TILL THE CD ACTUALLY COMES OUT YOU F*&^ING RETARDS."
1,garbage,dont even waste your time with this garbage. the dude has no talent and he is makin money off you retards who buy this...this isnt rap. this is just talentless garbage. the only talent that 50 cent has is being a comercial sell out who knows how to sucker stupid people into buying his music.if you truely love rap. i suggest hieroglyphics.
1,The Massacre should be a gunshot.,"This is a terrible, absolutely terrible piece of tarnished junk, that would make even rapper cuban link look embarrassed, I Thought every single song (except baltimore love thing) is a piece of trash, the beats are horrible, the lyrics is horrible, the cover is truly dreadful and the GGGGGGG G-UNIT! Catch phrase which I Still think is defintely the worst catch phrase creation of all time.This has got to be the lead contender for the worst album of 2005, and if this is a good album, then I Will cry.Next up for the 5-0 G-Unit disaster tony mayo.The Massacre is a tarnished mess.Big, Big, Big thumbs Down, Down, DownMusic Rating 0.1 No Stars."
1,GARBAGE:WORST 50 CENT ALBUM I EVER HEARD!!!,"THIS ENTIRE CD WAS STRAIGHT UP TRASH (THE VIDEOS,COVER/ART WORK,PRODUCTION ETC)& THESE WERE THE ONLY SONGS I LIKED A LITTLE ""In My Hood"",""This Is 50"",""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"" !!!"
2,"4 listenable tracks and 18 sad, sad duds.",Candy Shop - 4/5Just A Lil Bit - 3/5Disco Inferno - 4.5/5Hate It Or Love It (Remix) - 4.5/5All Others: 2/5Cover Art: DInside Art: CSongwriting: D-Vocals: D-Vocal Emotion: FProduction: C+Length: F-52/22 = 2.363636363636362.36 - .3 for clean version (yuck!)2.06 stars.Overall: D-
2,Not the greatest CD in the world,"I'm going to keep this short and simple. The truth is, the material on this CD isn't the best from 50 Cent. There are a few good songs that you can listen to over and over, most of the beats on the CD are pretty good, and basically that is it. If you are a ""gangster"" or a person who likes to play loud rap music in their car, this is for you. If you don't fall into this category, I'm sorry, but you'll end up being quite disappointed."
1,Disgrace garbage trash,"I can see why some one would try to shoot 50... Honestly idk why any one likes 50 cent & why would anybody in their right mind buy this garbage ? Hip hop ain been the same since the 90's still there's some mc's who still try to save it but sadly if we keep getting lil john, gay unit, dipset and all that commercial trash that killed the real hip hop in the first place ? it will die.Anyways, 50 cent's""the massacre"" is simply weak, wack, boring, dumb,annnoying voice by 50 and one more thing ?G unit been on mtv trl before so i heard...This is girly rap & pop mainstream garbage at its worst. Just my opinion peace out! 50 stop trying to be like pac cause you'll never get close to his talent and stop taking off your shirt you bi tch a ss nu gga!Soft, fruit cake 50 cent and the rest of the c ock sucka z in g unit."
1,Sorry D Cuffee i got to explain more,"i know biggie and pac rap about money and cars...but they didnt kill it.. the rappers nowadays all they do is rap obout their riches... and pac and biggie were originals....the SKI MASK WAY song was originaly from biggie who says it in a few songs such as Flava In Ya Ear Remix....i am not a hater i speaking the truth..yes 50 cent is average for rap nowadays but im sick of this rap... the rap game needs something original...50 cent is using beef to sells more records...pac and biggie did that... he wants to die of gun wounds...pac and biggie did that...everyone is listening to pac and biggie and eazy e and NWA and BONE THUGS still after over 10 years...this shows how the rap game is changed... yes we need some underground cats to come up and put some original flow into this rap game...and u cant call me a hater because the majority of the people reveiw this cd gave it 1 star also.aftermath ""hero"""
3,50 gets a C+,"This can't touch ""Get Rich or Die Try'n"". All his disses and self-created drama start to sound stupid. What's he so angry about??? Dissing Nas is crossing the line. How do you expect anyone who is a true fan of rap music to respect that?Album not bad -- just a case of over-hyping and under-delivering. I will lose all the filler and put good tracks on my Ipod. Songs where he is on other people's tracks have been better recently (The Game, Eminnem and Snoop Dog).I would recomend The Game's new album (Documentary) or Em's (Encore) over this one if you were to buy only one Dr. Dre protogee album.Of course if you haven't heard 50's first album I would reccomend that."
3,50's Massacre is OK with me,"After reading the other reviews I was convinced ""The Massacare"" was garbage. Someone told me it wasn't that bad & gave me their CD to listen to. I have to admit I was suprised. Its no where near his first abulm, but it's not as bad as these reviews make it sound. If you're a 50 fan then you won't be disapointed. Out of the 22 tracks on the CD 12 are definatley songs that are hot ( lyrics + beats = hot track. The other 9 (excluding the intro)are just ok, I've been listening to my favorite 12 tracks over & over. So, I would recommend that you listen to if for yourself & make your own decision. Because if I didn't hear it for myself I would've let the bad reviews cause me to miss out."
1,And there goes hip hop,"To sum it all up real quick: this album is filled with pathetic ryhming and his inability to rap is so easily filled by singing. 50 Cent is a shame to hip hop and I wonder if the likes of Pac, Biggie and Eazy were still with us would 50 Cent be where he is now?"
2,disapointed,"I was disapointed ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" was better ""Guess Whos Back?"" (2002) was better it just sounds all the same with a few good songs.a baltimore love thing is good and gat man and robbin is good the rest of it blends together it dose not sound like anything on games ems or any other g unit album or the 2050 before the massacre mixtape."
4,The Massacre,"I have to admit that when i first listened to this album i was incredibly disappointed. However, it soon began to grow on me. I particularly liked ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"", ""In My Hood"" and ""Just a Lil Bit"". I believe that 50 put in much more effort into his album, and should relax when making his next one. He will sell at record levels no matter how good or bad it is. The beats are incredible, expecially in songs such as Candy Shop and Just a Lil Bit, where he combines old Arabic melodies and incoporates them into a fine rap album.Honestly, this album is great, and the reason why so many people are disappointed is because 50 Cent created so much hype before his release. They expected something along the lines of ""masterpiece"", such as 2Pac's All Eyez On Me. There is still a long way to go before they get something which reaches that level."
3,Its an average album from an average mc,"50ent isn't all he claims to be we all know he has a sick production team on the best lables(aftermath,shady,gunit)and tons of ""street credit"" put he is just an average lyricist. I have to say some of the songs are really good. like ""In my hood"" wich is agreat start to the album.others""dico inferno"",baltimore love thang"" (were 50 rymes as if he is herion),""ski mask way"" ""go gave me style"" and the awsome remix of ""leave it or love it""' which is featuring gunit (young buck has the best verse in that song)and a few other great songs but there is also alot of disapointments.Like ""Candy shop"" and a few others its certantly no ""Get rich or die tryin"" but its worth the money.P.s piggy bank isn't that bad of a diss dong just stop hatin people"
3,not nearly as good as Get Rich or Die Tryin,"this is an ok cd, but if anyone says its better than get rich, they're just saying what they wish was true. I wish it was better than get rich also, but its really not. There are some very good songs like the singles they released, Outta Control, and Gatman and Robbin. But there are also some songs that are, in my opinion, just not good, such as Baltimore Love Thing and Ryder Music. I think the fact that Dre only produced a few tracks on this cd affected the fact that its not that good. If all the songs were as good or almost as good as Disco Inferno, Candy Shop, Piggybank, and Outta Control, it would be one of the greatest rap cds ever made. But sadly, they aren't, so overall, out of the 21 tracks, only about 10 or 11 are worth listening to."
2,throw in tha towel ...ya finishd,"the only reason i even gave this album 2 stars is because the joint 'baltimore love thing'but all the other trakson this album is garbage and if i hear 'candy shop'one mo ginimma have somebody shoot me 9x to put me out my misery.50 cent got as much lyrical genius as lil jon and eastside boyzand that dont say much...how much brains does it take to makea hook out of cliggity clank,piggy bank...anybody that keeps thiscommercial bs in rotation is the exact desease thats crippling hip hop today,and they need to be thrown in the fireright along with this booboo excuse for an album.money dont make you a great mc,mike skillz,hunger,hard work,anddetermination does.50 cent once had it but now he's like a washed up heavyweight champ thats been knocked thru tha ropes.somebody please throw in tha towel b4 this man gets hurt....and oh yea trust,he dont want it wit joe crack and kiss they bove ya level playa. peace and luv"
3,This Would be Great if it Wasn't 50,"Get Rich or Die Tryin' was excellent. I loved every song. It was a great album. My least favorite song was In Da Club, and the singles released for The Massacre have that same commercial and poppy edge. I had a feeling The Massacre was going to disappoint me, but I bought it anyway. I love 50 and G-Unit, so I listened to the CD, and it was alright. But it doesn't come close to GRODT. So if you compare The Massacre to GRODT, its completely awful. So if this was anyone else, this CD would be good. Not great, but good. But this happens to be 50, and this album happens to suck.The Best 3:8. Outta Control9. Get In My Car22. Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix)"
3,3 Stars Half Hot/Half Not,"50 50 50, you r getting commercial dog, i hate to say it homie, you were on top with your first album and your mixtape but this sounds like get rich or die trying part 2. He repeats himself so much. It is worth buying though i do listen to it but its rare but its still copping material. the best songs on there is ""im suppose to die tonight"", Ryder Music"", and ""Outta Control"",but from there is gets garabage. He makes some garabge tracks on this ablbum,GARABAGE.Like ""gatman & robin"" (What!), so stupid, also piggybank is ok execpt for the hook. you know what ,whoever wants this bad go get it but you are going to be skipping a lot of tracks."
1,You People Must Be Mad!!!,"I am a die hard real hip hop fan and this CD is GARBAGE. It does not deserve the one star I gave him. Don't buy his album. If you really want it, BURN IT. The cd is about him being angry at everyone. Would we even know who 50cent is if he didn't have beef with every one in the Rap game. And how dare he attack NAS. 50cent can't even pronounciate his words let alone compose them lyricaly like NAS. The album has some good beats but thats it. The lyrical content is weak. Please don't support this album. And to make matters worst 50cent said in an interview that he does not even spend time with his son because he is so busy. He said that he just gives him money and thats the extent of his fatherly duties. So not only does he suck as an artist, he sucks as a black man and a human. F**k 50. Put down the mic and go take care of your kids!! GO GET THE GAME!!! WAY BETTER CD"
1,Xtremely Overrated,"I heard this album about 2 weeks ago and I was very dissapointed. All of the beats xcept for Just A Lil Bit are WACK. 50's lyrics are horrible, he raps about the same stuff over and over. The song Piggy Bank had so much hype, but when I heard it I immediately turned it off because the beat is awful. I recomend everyone to not buy this cd, because you will be just wasting your money."
2,Tired,"I already wasted my time buying it so I'm not going to turn around and waste another 10 minutes of my time telling you exactly why it wasn't worth buying, even though the hardcore fans will love it.I'm not a fan of 50 cent. I'm a fan of rap music. I don't like what he's using it for and producing from it. I don't like the way he copies Nas's original genius (Telling a hood story from the perspective of the gun) and then turns it into second rate copy cat bullcrap (telling a hood story from the perspective of a ""drug""). Way to go Vanilla Ice. You're right, that sounds nothing like ""Under pressure"" you're totally original.I've already wasted five more minutes than I intended to. This was the most highly anticipated release of the year and it's getting three stars. 'Nuff said. If the giggling 14 year old girls ain't giving it five's straight down the line, something's always wrong."
1,CRAP-TACULAR,"50 Cent thinks that he is god's gift to rap--which is far from the truth.. Some of the beats are decent, but the rap itself is bunk. It's all the same stuf from all 50's other songs being said over and over again.He has no right dissing Jadakiss who is twice the MC that 50 Cent. Bottom line...IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE SAME OLD CRAP THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD MANY TIMES OVER then buy this piece of crap album."
1,well.........plz don waste ur money,"what can i say bout the massacre? its horrible....all he does is rap about money , hoes and guns..........sorry..did i say rap? i mean sings. the beats r good and xcept for gatman and robin, nothing was worth listening. 50 cent iss going down. i seriously hope GAME ends his careerG-G-G-G-G-G UNOTplz don waste ur money"
2,A Massacre?,"Ok so 50 cent titles his second album the massacre. I can understand taking shots at Fat Joe and Ja Rule but to go as far as to diss one of the greatest artists ever. Nas has layed down some of the best verses in history. Also he has made some of the most influencial rap songs ever with songs like ""One Mic"" and ""I Can."" Lets face it 50 is not in his league and never will be..put some content in your songs for once. He said The Massacre would out sell Get Rich or Die Tryin..its not going to because he doesnt put out much quality material. In Da Club made his career and once everyone eventually forgets about that song 50 will eventually fade off. 2 stars because some of the collabos are decent."
1,HUH?,"STOP PLAYIN!!! PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS GOOD MUSIC?? THERE IS A WACKNESS EPIDEMIC GOING ON AS I TYPE THIS REVIEW.. PLEASE.. STOP THE BS, THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE.. WHAT YOU SAY ON THIS WILL BE HEARD BY THE KIDS.. 50 AND GUNIT AND THE REST OF THE CRUNK CREW SHOULD BE A SHAMED OF THEM SELVES.. THIS IS NOT, AND I REPEAT, NOT MUSIC........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THUG CRAP SO YOU YOUNG BLACKS CAN IMMITATE THIS NONE SENSE.. PLEASE BE SMARTER THAN THAT!!! ONE LOVENO STARS!!!!!!!"
1,horrible,"This album takes the word horrible to a brand new level. It is a prime example of what is happening to rap. The only thing 50 raps about other than himself are his material possesions and hoes. This is the worst album I have ever listened to.My friend burned this for me right after it came out. I listened to it once, took it outside, and shot it with my pistol.If you want a good rap/hiphop album, get out and cop something by MF Doom, Wordsworth, Kanye West or De La Soul.Overall I would give this album a 0/10. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! THE MORE YOU BUY THE MORE GARBAGE HE WILL PUT OUT!!!"
1,Terrible,"This album is terrible. 50 Cent feels that he can put out anything and it will sell. There are no songs I can vibe to except ""Hate It or Love It Remix."" ""Piggybank"" is the worst diss song I have ever heard. Please do not buy this album, the only reason I gave it one star is because that was the lowest I could go."
2,Coporate 50 Strikes Again!,"If you feel like wasting your money to allow this bonehead to further rule all media outlets around the country then this cd re-release is for you. To think that someone would actually spend money on this is beyond me, I don't understand why fans don't see threw all the coporate motivies of these artists who release previous material to make more money for something you've already heard! So go ahead spend that cash on this crap and when 50 releases another re-re-release of this cd I hope you finally understand what they are doing and come to your senses."
1,Got RIch and Died Crying,"he should have called this got rich and died crying. 50 Cent's Career is done. hes F****** with the wrong people. Hopefully Jay will tell 50 the story on how he got torn to shreds in the past. once rappers start exposing 50 and ripping him apart and finally realizing how much of a retard he is, they will turn away from him and stop buying his records and 50 will be put out of business. just watch. 50's career is done for."
1,why give more than 50 million to this man?,"...this man has made 50 million dollars (a lot of 50cent pieces) by promoting misogyny, murder, drugs, violence and a genuine anger for all things pure and good...and yet we pour money into him, his clothes, his style, why? do you want your children to grow in a world where the #1 seller is supporting everything evil with no remorse? what does this do to our future? so the ""beats are great,"" and what of it? they'll be forgotten and overplayed in a matter of time and we're left with an emptiness that we think can be filled by more and more shallow rap like 50's...there used to be a meaning and essence in rap/hiphop...for some quality go to men like Kweli and Mos Def...not this joke."
1,Finally an honest rapper!,His name equates his value which translates into his abilities.Less than 1 dollar.
1,Rap Destroyer,"the man responsible for destroying the art of hip hop and the one who benedict arnold us with his dumb love songs...bottom line, dont buy gunit merchandise or albums"
2,Reality,"Yo know why 50 got shot so many times , couse that b*itc never learned the gangsta way of life. Real G are ridin' low below the surface. I can bellive two O.G.s like GAME and Snoop are blezin' with such a slut. The thing is that i liked ""get rich or die tryn'"" but the new bullsh*t is just outstanding. The same lyrics , the same beats over and f*cking over again. Only talk about sluts and money. I bet if 2pac was still alive he would shoot that phony hoe himself.Word to the real ridaz"
3,Yeah Itz Tyte,ok i'm not dissin 50 Cent for this cd but we should already know why he is re-realising his cd with the dvd . He is only doing this because The Massacre did not sale as much as he thought it would . The DVD is great i love the videos but he did all this work just because he said the The Massacre would be better than Get Rich or Die Tryin and its not... I still like The Game better anywayz... GGG-Unot
3,once you have heard one you have heard them all,"Ok look, this is some good background music. The songs are the same. Every song includes the following.......1. Flute thing playing2 Some random drums3. Him talking/singing the lyrics4 Lyric are ALWAYS are about sex, just because its about sex, does not make it good."
3,W-T-F,"HOLY CRAP i was just browsin thru the reviews...and all i saw were 1-star ratings all titled with ""WORST ALBUM EVER"" or ""RAP SUCKS"". How is this album even 2.5 stars with the ratings its being given. ***HOW BOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DISLIKE RAP DO NOT RATE OR COMMENT ON THIS ALBUM. WHY U EVEN LOOKIN AT HIS CD IF U HATE IT SO MUCH. DON""T JUDGE RAP BY 50 CENT."
2,GARGABE!!!!!!!,"I listened to this whole album and there are maybe 3 songs on there that are any good. The worst song is by far Gatman and Robin ( with Eminem ). The best song is piggybank. The production is good ( that's why I gave it a gracious 2 stars ) but the lyrics are terrible. I thought it was just me until I let a couple of my friends listen to it also and they all agreed with me. I was looking forward to this CD for a very long time. When I finally heard it I was very dissapointed. 50 is trying to sing on just about every hook on his songs ( isn't that one of the reasons why he dissed Ja Rule ) and he does not sound that great. If you are going to buy this and think it is anything like Get Rich or Die Trying, you will be dissapointed greatly.......Save your money!!!!!"
1,ok come guys u guys are sad,"i cant believe people are given this cd a 5 star rating....Biggie and Tupac get 5 star ratings...but 50 cent his lyrics have got to be terrible like come u guys are given this guy 5 stars which means u guys are comparing him to higher leagues such as Biggie and Tuapc...like r u guys all retarded..u guys are the stupidest people out here...millions dollars say u guys don't even know who biggie is...u guys are losers cant even listen to decent music. these guys like 50 and Ja and chingy and fabulas are all killing to rap game..rap now a days arnt even worth listening to..everybody i know listen to the clasics...EVERY ONE WANTS THE RAP LIKE IT USE TO BE...NO RAP ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY U GOT OR IF U HAVE A MILLION CARS RAP NEEDS TO COME FROM THE HEART...this is by aftermath ""hero"" from the peg"
2,Sucks SO bad that I don't know what to do with myself!,Candy Shop - 4/5Just A Lil Bit - 3/5Disco Inferno - 4.5/5Hate It Or Love It (Remix) - 4.5/5All Others: 2/5Cover Art: DInside Art: CSongwriting: D-Vocals: F+Vocal Emotion: FProduction: C+Length: F-52/22 = 2.363636363636362.36 stars.Overall: D-
1,too expensive,its well known by really clever people that hipop is no music just a toolong lasting trouble but this ugly guy inside&outside check the mug......is the worse
3,dvd is very good,"I originally bought this CD, didn't like it, reviewed it, and gave it 2 stars. I recently recieved this special edition for my birthday. At first I was extremely disappointed, as I already had the album and didn't think the DVD could save this release. But it does.50's videos have alway been of a high quality. So to get 21 new ones on one DVD is a very good thing. All the videos are of the high quality you expect from him, and compliment the songs well. It was a good decision to re-release thise as a CD/DVD combo. If you haven't bought 'The Massacre' yet, make sure you get it with the DVD. It doesn't make it an instant classic, but it helps it scrape in for 3 stars."
2,Look at at each side of the scale and ask yourself....,"Really, in all honesty most of this cd just blows. There are a couple of people who think this cd is BETTER than Get Rich!! C'mon, are you serious??? There is no possible way you can even compare them. Judging by the singles that came from this cd, I thought it was going to be awesome. NOPE, 50 just used up the only decent songs on the album to produce singles, minus a few other songs on the cd that are aight. So look at it like this, there are WAY MORE people that say that this cd sucks than people that like it. Save your money, listen to the OG's like Dre and EM. They made 50 anyway."
2,I will give this guy credit for this.............,"Musically, this album was a huge disappointment. The constant dissing of other rappers to sell records is straight wack. But I will give 50 credit for being a excellent salesman. Every chance this guy gets to sell 50 Cent, he does it. He gets down and dirty."
2,just under average,"i gave this album less than 3 stars because it has more bad songs than good ones.i think there are many tracks 50 shuldve left out.some of the songs aren't bad and have a real grimy feeling to it like get in my car,im supposed to die tonight,in my hood.there are about 12 songs in this album 50 shuldve left out or replaced with something else."
2,Let Down....,"I agree with Scott D. Gribble ""scottgrib"" 50 Cents album the massacure was so-so (or 2 out of 5 stars) BUT u also half to give props 2 50 Cent beacuse al though his album mabe BAD it still sold Millions of copyies! I bought his album and thought it would BE GREAT but in his songs has has stuff that has to do with ""pimpin"", drugs, guns and sex!! I thought his cd was good for the 1st day or so then it got kinda old mostly ALL of his songs have somthing to do with sex, drugs and guns and it gets boring over all....... I still love 50 cent but he could have done better on this album"
3,massacre review Johnson Jean,"Get rich or die tryin' was a solid album. This album is average and as a fan of 50 he could have done better. He has a few good tracks like I'm suppose to die tonight , piggy bank, outta control,get in my car, and position of power. 50 knows he didn't gives his best in this album and should take his time on his next album and show why he sold 11 million on his first LP."
1,"Why isn't there a ""0"" rating option?","I can't believe rap is so mainstream. It is the fakest music out there, and 50 Cent is among the worst artists ever, ranking with singers like Davey Jones and the jerk who writes the music for Barney the Dinosaur. I reccomend you don't buy this album and save your ears for real music like the Beatles, NOFX, Green Day (before 2005), Tenacious D, and anything else that doesn't suck like 50 Cent does."
2,The Massacre - 50 Cent,"First of all i ain't got nuthin against 50. i love ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin"" and also him on The Game's Cd (Hate it Or Love it, How We Do). But this album simply sucks! I m not oneof the people who r sayin that 50 cent is not hip hop or is a pop artist! he is not! he is a rapper because music is entertaintment! Rap is music so it is also entertaintment. and that's what 50 Cent is doing. He is a entertainer!!Now going towards the album, there is not much to say except it is not what i expected! after listening to ""Candy Shop"" and ""Lil' Bit"" i was expecting the same thing as GRODT but obviously it is not!What I don't understand is why 50 wants beef wit NAS!!!! I mean if he really wanted a promo stunt, beef wit Jada and Fat Joe is enough! There is NO WAY he gonna be able to beat Nas!I gave this album 2 stars becuz of the beats and ""I'm Suppose to Die Tonite""!Download the album if u really want to listen it or u can just download few songs cuz rest of the album is wack!"
3,The Hype Killed It,"To each its own with this latest cd. Get Rich or Die Trying was an instant classic, you could listen to the whole cd through without skipping a song. The Massacre on the other hand has a handful of songs that I didn't care for so I skipped the track. The cd is cool, but the hype killed it, and 50 put too much pressure on himself to create another masterpiece. The bad thing is this fell just a little short of a masterpiece. 50's still the hottest rapper out though.CHECK OUT T.I. cd URBAN LEGENDS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,No,"This album is less signifigant than a hair on my left nut. Am I the only one that notices that 50 doesn't even try? It seems like all his verses are all one word. And I'm no fan of anyone he disses, they suck too. Except Nas, Nas is 50 times the rapper 50 could ever be. But do you fools realize that there is good music that Isn't played on the radio. Geezus. Gangsta rap sucks, these fools aint gangstas. Get with the underground."
1,The Newcomer Rapper That Couldn't: 50 Cent's Downfall,"This pretentious collection of ""made for radio"" rap is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The once thought provoking and lyrically adventerous rhymes of 50 Cent have yet to be found on this album. Offered from the newcomer with fading potential are dirty lymerics of self indulging tripe, sexual deviance, and poor humor. The musical growth rate of 50 Cent cannot even be charted. He is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
1,ABC rapper lucky enough to get decent beats.,"50 Cent is absolute garbage and this album will probably be the most hyped up piece of fetid trash to come out of hip hop this year.He is at best a mediocre rapper lucky enough to be connected to Dre and eminem. Disco Inferno is tepid garbage. He is calculating enough to know that the brain dead white teenagers in America will buy anything that supposedly sports a ""hot"" beat but any true fan of hip hop will recognize that he is utterly devoid of any inspiration. He has nothing positive to say, just the same old tired cliches we have heard a billion times before.The fact that he has the audacity to diss Nas, who could rap circles around him is stunning. He never abandons the single syllable rhyming structure while Nas is one of the most athletic rhymers on the planet.Of course Rolling Stone and other lame ass publications will promote this but that doesn't mean it is any good. Save your money."
3,pretty weak,"as i hope most people will realize, this is the super-commercialized MADE FOR RADIO CD. Get rich was more of a personal journey with some serious emotion and heat behind it, thats what made it such a strong cd in a time mainstream rap is a disgrace to hip hop and black culture in general. This cd is nothin but another yo i got ho's, blunts, money, and im a gangsta cd. this brings absolutly nothing to rap. the rhymes themeselves arent even that good, the songs are almost completely fueled by the beats, which are not as good as on get rich either. in short, this cd is a joke, dont waste your money. its lucky i was generous enough to give it three stars (for like 2 and 1/2).FOR THE BEST HIP HOP AND RAP AROUND CHECK OUT: Immortal Technique, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Sage Francis...o ya and Royce Da 5'9"
2,hmmm...Pretty Darn bad,"I aint going to hate on 50 cause he makes his money or whateva and he is relatively entertaining with all his beef and thug themes etc....BUt musically, lyrically, and just in general...He is horrible...His old stuff is not that bad and thier is 2-3 listenable songs on this CD...But as a whole this is his worst by far...He is drowning deeper into pop.. He has been on a steady decline ever since fame hit him. Keep doing your thing 50 but i wont be buying it...I will get the bootleg"
1,Disgusted,"I am not really into Hip Hop but I can tell that you 50 is trash and he only cares about money. I cant even fathom why people compare him to Tu pac who was brilliant at what he did and was a true poet with his words. He is to rap what Madonna and Michael are to pop and what Elvis/The Beatles/Aerosmith and so on, are to rock. 50 will never become legendary like these TRUE ARTISTS. People who like this probably think Hil. Duff is an artist as well. lol"
1,G-Unot!!!,"Is he serious? Was this album some sort of joke? It wasn't worth what I paid. And I bootlegged the stupid cd for me and 10 of my friends, we were all mad. He should be paying me to cop this garbage. All 50 fans who say this album is great, 50's got tight flow, lies. Face it, the fool can't rap. Period. He's garbage, even Dre and Em can't help him."
3,eh......,"This album is not at all what it hyped up to be....i only counted maybe 4 good songs on this cd: Just a lil bit, a baltimore love thing, ski mask way, and im so hood and the rest are either aight or just bad like piggy bank wtf is he thinkin tryin to call out everybody in the industry.......ne way dont waste 18 dollars on this ur better off just burning it...2.5 stars"
4,Hot as You Think,"Seems like in the past couple weeks, people have really started to hate on 50, and thats going to happen when he is opening in mouth, in the news and on air. But whatever your opion, go Cop this new 50, and you honestly tell me that it's not just as hot as Get Rich or Die Tryin'.I've also herd alot of people tryin to dis, cause the album isn't full of Dr. Dre. Well take a listen and you'll see that 50 is 50, not dre's 50, not Em's 50. I feel that he could lace anything and make it hot, North, South East or West, 50 will make it Hot.So if you have any Doubts, DON'T. Go get it, put it in the player, and i bet it doesn't leave for Days. Don't Forget to check out Piggy Bank, I Supposed to Die Tonight, Gatman and Robbin, and also Get in my Car produced by Hi-Tek."
5,50 CENT IS MY MASSACRE,WHY I LIKED THE SONG CANDY SHOP. I LIKE THE SONG CAUSE HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BOARED WITH OUT A THING TO DO IF SO THIS SONG WILL HAVE YOU UP AND DANCING YOUR BUTT OFF AND WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THAT IS THE SONG HAS A GOOD DANCING BEAT SO YOU CAN GET GIGGY WITH IT AND THE WORDS GO GOOD WITH THE BEAT AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME A PERSON THAT LOVES HOW HIS VOICE SOUNDS IF I WAS YOU I WOULD GO CHECK IT OUT YOU MIGHT JUST BE THE ONE HE TAKES TO THE CANDY SHOP.BY:LACIA MCLAUGHLINHOLLA AT YOUR GIRL.
1,if only we could give negative stars...,"this album is HORRIBLE! i hate 50 cent cuz hes not lyrical at all, hes just a pop star who claims to hav street cred that he doesnt have, just watch Stop Snitchin Stop Lyin, and you'll change ur mind. if only i could cuss on here.....ps i hate 50 and gunit"
1,50 IS A MASSCRE,curtis 'candy shop' jackson has put out another commercial piece of sh*t n added another mill 2 his pocket. any 50 d*ck rider cant even say this is half as good as i'll get rich and stop tryin. n e 1 that likes this *ss probably had 50 himself take them 2 tha candy shop and lick his lollipop. only a f*agg*t *ss dude or a pre-adolescent white girl would wanna buy his records or be his personal b*tch. a candy shop ho would have 2 be pregnant to have 2 brain cells in her body 2 listen to him. For all his groupies get his d*ck out your mouth n listen 2 sum real sh*t.
1,this cd is a MASSACRE,"Let me see if I got this straight, this bubbling idiot got shot has two cds and thinks that he should be bigger than Samuel Jackson in his sorry movie! what? Your music is okay but the rap is so weak we need a translator to know what the hell you are saying. You are so hardcore but yet you live in one of the best cities in Connecticut. You throw at Jarule, Fat Joe, Nas and Jadakiss but you can't hold a candle to them. You know your first problem, hooking up with the west coast. Soon the bubbling rap will get old, then what? back to the streets.This cd sucks, like everything else produced by the idiots Eminem (just out of rehab), Dr. Dre (has been)and by someone who actually calls himself 50cents.Your next cd should be called: ""What Fries with That?"" (your next job)"
1,Wow....,"What a bad CD, and I don't mean bad as GOOD! This CD was pushed back a few times, and there's a bootleg CD of unreleased tracks floating around that sound better than this mess! All of the delays & name changes aren't justified after listening to the lame monotone rapping & song recycling that's in full effect here! 50 Cent is over rated, and his 15 minutes are almost up! This CD will sell like hotcakes for a few days, and THEN a TON of USED COPIES WILL appear for the taking! Unlike so many poor souls, I was able to unload my copy and get my money back! I wish everyone good luck in doing the same! In closing, this CD is a Shot Up Buck Toothed HOT MESS! 50, it's ova!"
2,A dissapointing follow up,"this CD had alot of pottential and was over hyped. the first thing i realized when listening to this cd was, 50 cent can't carry a cd by himself, a song or two sure. it's fairly common knowledge that 50 is probly the worst lyrically in g-unit. this cd show's it more then any, even tony yayo kills him on his own track. compared to the game's documentary, lloyd banks's hunger for more and young bucks straight out of cashville this CD is by far inferior. this album also seems a little to pop rap for 50, yeah his last album had some club hits. but i don't remember some chick singing the hook. he should have stuck with the west coast tried and true formula to success. nate dogg on the hook, and feature 16 bars from other rappers on almost every song.all in all the cd is ok, but i wouldn't got past that, just ok"
1,"""Banish"" this loser from the music business","The title of this guys name aptly describes this losers worth,less than one dollar. Pathetic songs like DISCO INFERNO and CANDY SHOP are the most juvenile and retarded songs I have ever listened to.A PITY I CANT GIVE THIS JUNK LESS THAN ONE STAR.DONT BUY THIS AWFUL ALBUM.CONSERVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE WALL FROM PINK FLOYD INSTEAD."
1,I told u the documentary would b better than this junk,"honestly i'm not a fan of 50 or g-unit. i own a shirt that says g-unot on it. but the massacre is even more garbage from 50. The Game's ""The Documentary"" was the #1 album in the country and if your planning on buying this album u should check out The Game he is the next 2pac for sure."
1,borrowed it gave it bak with in a week,ive tried many times to see what the appeal of this album is and what is so good about the rap genre people like eminem at least have some talent and write some of the nice tunes over the top 50 cent is just dumb rap some guy with an obvious lisp trying to talk over some slushy bakbeats and dire grotesque keyboards or whatever they are in the bakground i may not be a fan of rap but this is crap even for the genre if your a fan of rap music thou check out eminem its much better than this crap
1,what is this crap?,this has got to be the most overplayed and most annoying piece of trash i've ever heard. i wouldn't recommend this $h!t to anyone. i feel sorry for who ever wasted there money on this crap. just like jadakiss said it's gonna end up as a weed plate. DON'T BUY IT!!
1,seriously 50 slap yourself,remember the interview on the new breed dvd where fifty was talkin bout bublegum rap isnt gonna work anymore and that its over well what i dont understand is why he is tryna revive it somebody pimp slap himwe aint gonna love him like Pacdo yourself a favour instead of buying this album donate the money to a monkey it will do you more satisfactionor buy the banks album thats alrighti want my money back
1,50 Cent's Album: Unbiased Review,"First of all, perhaps 50 Cent could come up with some new and original material besides guns, women, and chrome wheels! 50 has some nice beats but has shown no signs of lyrical growth or maturity on this album. He talks about the same played-out subjects over and over. Another thing is that it's not wise to diss Nas on your album; Jay Z already tried that and failed after Nas tore him to shreds. I don't think that 50 wants any part of Nas, in terms of a lyrical battle. After all, Nas is a rap legend with four classic albums (Illmatic, It was Written, Stillmatic and God's Son) whereas 50 is just another below-average rapper who has to boast and brag about getting shot. Anyways, there are a few decent songs on ""The Massacre"" but these few songs are not worth the $15. My advice: download the good songs but don't get the album!"
1,I;m officially done with rap,"This cd was bad.There are reasons why mtv did not rate this cd in the top 10 of all time.Can barely rap and even though Dr Dre produce most of the album, it would not have helped. He sold out, just opena cd case and see a coupon.Buy old school rap and kill off today awful rappers.PS buy illmatic Ready to die and all eyez on me and the chonic albums instead."
4,SICKKK but not as good as get rich or die tryin,i'm not a kidd this album is da bomb if in some hardcore rap and even dough its not ass good as get rich or die tryin its off de hook. so dont be hattin on 50 if you guys dont noe hardcore rap
4,Break it down,"hey guys: break it down for what it is. I listen to eminem because of his lyrics. I listen to 50 for the same reason. This CD has been bashed and praised. Listen to the entire CD, break down the tracks for the lyrical art that it is. I picked it up at Target for 9.98. Money well spent."
1,Can't get worse!,"This just might be the worst album of the year! Does this guy have any creativity, I doubt it?! Please do yourself a favour and do not buy this album, it's just a waste of your money. Spend it on real music! 50 cent sucks! Actually one star is way to much for this album..."
2,This CD sucks compared to Get Rich or Die Tryin,"This CD was supposed to be awesome but it isnt close. The only good songs are candy shop, disco inferno, and gatman and robbin. 50 Cent has turned into Ja Rule. DO NOT BUY THIS CD OR EVEN DOWNLOAD IT! IT IS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY!"
1,not good,this wasn't cd wasn't as good as ja rule's R.U.L.E. i was pretty disappointed that he was dissing ja again. and it was the worst of 2005.
1,Not good at all,You shouldn't pay 50 CENTS for this garbage. I think that the steroids 50 injected have finally gotten to him!Avoid this album at all costs!
1,Horrible.,This CD is horrible. 50 Cent really has gotten into the brains of children and alienated them into a sick world. Don't buy this CD...dont support communisim.
1,50 Cent is DEAD!!!,"Gah!!! This overplayed idiot is back!! Don't get me wrong.. I actually like Get Rich or Die Tryin', but I think its time 50 stopped. Candy Shop is overplayed garbage, I cannot see why everyone likes it. All he sings about is getting shot, 2pac, and how many girls he can screw in a night. This is crap at its worst."
1,Worst Album Ever,I know by now everyone is tired of buck teeth 50 cent.He is playing his self out. I was excited the day this album came out because i LIKED his first one. This album here is garbage. I dont see how in the heck candyshop went to number 1 on the billboard charts. Olivia's bad vocals messed up the song. She can't sing worth of crap. Just A lil bit is pacing up the charts. I dont see how. These songs are lame. In my hood and ski mask way are the only decent tracks. I dont even see how his albums sell so much. 50 U IS THE WORST MC EVER
1,Yo Yo My Homies,"Yo Yo. 50 cent sux, rap sux, this album, whateva it is called, SUX. Want some real music? Go listen to some solidstate. Yo Yo. 50 cent has no talent, what so ever. Peace Out"
4,A Substantial Improvement,"The Massacre, in comparison with Get Rich or Die Trying, shows growth by 50 as an artist. In my opinion, his lyrics far better on this disc. He also has a good mix of club records like 'Candy Shop' and 'Just A Lil Bit', and more serious tracks like 'A Baltimore Love Thing'. The only downfall of The Massacre, in my opinion, is the production. With high profile producers such as Scott Storch, Eminem, Dr. Dre, and SHA MONEY XL, I was expecting every song to have a sic beat behind it, which is not the case. All in all, The Massacre is a great Sophmore effort, and worth picking up."
2,It's lacking things... WEAK CD,"Most of these songs are already played out and the ones you haven't heard are more of a slow beat to it. Maybe a couple of the songs are pretty good but everything else is to mellow. His first CD is the (...), you can't top that what so ever. I should of bought Krayzie Bone CD: Gemini: Good Vs Evil. I got couple of his songs and i think im going to get it. PEACE"
2,hmmm,I have a review for the regular massacre cdOutta Control (regular) was the best song on The Massacre. Now they have a crappy remix
3,Same old 50,"Several of the songs on this album are much better than his first album, but not all of them, some of them out right suck, still better than JA."
1,Sorry but it sucks . . .,Ok first of all let me say i've never liked 50 cent! Not even close but he pushed the buttons when he dissed my boy Fat Joe (Boricua 4 lyfe). He disses people that don't have much rep' anyway. Also he's doing the same thing he dissed Ja Rule for doing! He's singing his own hooks and is making 'Pop-Bubble-Gum-Rap' just like Ja did. This album is way over rated and only has a couple of good beats. I cant stand 50 and I can't wait til' his time is over. So please spend your money on something better . . .
3,For All You Commercial Gangsters,This album is the perfect soundtrack for wannabe's and ironically enough the wankstas. One of the worst follow up albums by someone with such a promising career. Save the money and buy 50 Cent Guess Who's Back.
4,87%,"50 CENTS THE MASSACRE.... MY FAVE TRAX R*JUST A LIL' BIT**CANDY SHOP**THIS IS HOW WE DU**DISCO INFERNO**HATE IT OR LOVE IT**SO AMAZING*ALL IN ALL I PREFERED ""GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN'"" BUT...DIS IS NU N ITZ STILL 1 OV THA HEAVIEST!!!"
2,"50 FELL OFF, HE LOST HIS HUNGER","50 cent has fell off, i am personally very disapointed at this album, i dont think 50 could b bothered he lost his hunger, simple ! songs like build me up, jus a lil bit , candy shop, so amazin the list goes on are ja rle copies. 50 was my favourite rapper even bak in 2001 before get rich. power of the dollar is the best album i have ever heardliterally . many of u fake cats probly havent heard it only tru 50 fans (or ex fans) have this, the lyrics , flow, storytelling abiluties are amaizng. but he is far too cocky and far too arogant he is a d**K i hate em right now!! rap is nothin any more. the chronic, all eyez on me reasonable doubt illmatic ready to die , power of the dollar classsic old aalbums settled"
1,"Overrated, talentless","50 Cent is talentless. On the album he simply talks over the most simple backing music which is just repeated over and over. This is not what true music is all about. He is just as manufactured as Britney Spears only kids think he is ""cool"". It's a case of all marketing and no talent."
1,good muscles,"50 was already ripped, is this 'photoshop',or did he bulk up to olympian standards? The music is horrible. If you like the muscles, go the to the Mr. Olympia contests, and see the real thing."
1,I GUESS THEY WOULD GIVE A RECORD DEAL TO ANYONE THESE DAYS. TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have never heard such garbage. Nuff said.
1,narwhal,BOO FIFTY SUCKS YEAH THATS RIGHT CAUSE HE IS A COTTON HEADED NINNY MUGGINS AND HE IS STUPID REAL RAP IS DIZZEE RASCAL AND RUN DMC AND THE SHINS BUT THEY ARE NOT RAP BUT THE BEST BAND EVER AND THIS GUY IS STUPID DID ANYONE READ HIS SPIN INTERVIEW HE IS REALLY REALLY STUPID BECAUSE HE IS A STUPID PERSON WHO IS STUPID!!!!!!!!!!
1,overrated,"50 aint no real g, he dont respect the game, neither one even, though they kinda 1 in the same. he overrated. i tried to give this shhh no stars but i couldnt."
1,YOU YOUNG KIDS DONT KNOW ANYTHING,man anyone who thinks this album is worth a damn is stupid..get bumpy johnson and im not talkin bout the hustle life..bumpy johnson..i mean bumpy johnson froom chicago..the goon squad..that cd puts any cd from last year to this year to shame..
1,Wackkkkk,dont diss anyone unless you have sumthing hard and good to diss them about. dont act like a 19 year old high school kid picking fights on whoever just to grab attention. how old are you? your 28 years old and picking fights like a high school kid??? grow the F**k up!!!
5,What Are You Talking About????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, let me get some things straight. 50 Cent is not a sell-out. And i know he be talking about that he`ll kill somebody. That`s revenge on some rappers that hate him, ja-rule, fat joe, and jadakiss. Like on that song I Don`t Need Em, He`s saying that his friends don`t be around he`s down , shot, and he`s bleeding.So like a whole bunch haters hatin on him and this cd, they don`t understand this album. And Olivia is not Ashanti ja`rule don`t even have a singing group like G-unit and Olivia is the lady of G-Unit.Some people think that she`s playing the role of Ashanti, that`s not true.So this is for all y`all other haters, f*ck all of y`all and go to hell where y`all belong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This Album Sucks,"Listen people, don't buy this album. This album is garbage. This album is less than nothing. The maximum amount of starts I would give it would be -5. But the lowest is a 1 of course. Fifty is garbage and this album should have never been released. The dumbest thing he could do is kick the Game out of G-Unit. Please people, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Save your money and go buy Untold Story or The Documentary from the Game. Once again, THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE, YOU SUCK FIFTY!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,50 cent is over,After hearing the first couple of songs on the Massacre I had to turn it off it was so bad. 50 cent is over. The hype the he had with his first cd is done and hopefully all the trash that he talks to other rappers should be done to. He has no better rhymes the my baby brother.
1,trash,terrible production terrible content. dont wasste your money. get rich or die trying had memorable tracks. after playing the cd through the only track i like and can remember is hate it or love it. i bought it at target for $9 so i dont feel as bad. i watched the special on mtv with him and sway and was really looking forward to the album. especially after hearing him talk about the production and how slamming the beats were. but i wonder why he made this album. he said in the interview that if your making albums for yourself than you should keep thaat #$@% to yourself and play it in your headphones at home. after hearing the album i cant phathom that this album could've possibly been made for the 11 million americans that buy his albums.
1,Garbage...,"Just like every other commercial rap album 50 cent's ""Massacre (coll) (dig) (spkg) "" falls flat with weak tracks and boring lirycs from 50 cent and the only thing plus about 50? Is the conterversy that surrounds him but nothing else...Come on, he dissed nas, jada,fat joe and those guys been doing hip-hop thats from the street...So if you support 50? That means you dont support real hip-hop! Peace !"
2,Not So Hot...,"If you take 50's debut CD and all thats he's been saying about how great this new jaunt is, you'd obvioulsy expect it to be hot. I was way beyond dissapointed when I heard this CD. Its pretty much just average, the songs are alike, and it all just kinda runs together. The lyrical content is just not there. I dont know what happened with this, but I really wouldnt bother with it. It kinda makes sense all the beef with Game just started going down before he dropped this. It's gonna sell records. Cause after people hear this, his sales aren't gonna be so good. Thats my opinion, but I think he coulda done much better. If you wanna hear this CD, get a bootleg or download it, dont waste your money."
2,Im not a hater...just tellin the truth,yes people r mad at 50 for booting game and so am i...this album isnt that good though.. serously these songs show how big of an ego he has...hes dissin like 8 rapper. sayin hes the best...i dont even like Ja rule or Jada or Fat joe...its just the fact that even they are laughin at him..4 thinkin hes the KING OF RAP..which he is not...50 cent is just gettin luaghed at....he says that he the most best at writing lyrics.he said he even tops tuapc and biggie...GET THE DOCUMENTRY...the game is a rapper who pays respect to other rappers.
1,OH MY GOD!! THIS CAN'T BE....,"This one of the worst hip hop albums I have ever heard. The Game's album was 1000x better than this garbage. Don't buy this album, go buy some 2pac if you want some real rap. GRODT was 1,000,000x better than this sorry sophomore release."
1,rap......still?,"I really congratulate the rappers....the same product selling for millions for years...they are genious, really...i have one rap album, it seems i have a thousand."
1,"The Game's ""The Documentary"" Kills 50 Cent's ""The Massacre"",","The Massacre is a huge disappointment. Get Rich or Die Tryin is way better. The Massacre is no way to follow up a classic. 50 should have never kicked anybody out the group that put out a better CD than him this years. The Documentary is still by far the best Rap Ablum this year. The only good songs on 50's album are ""Piggy Bank (Good just because of the hype and beef), Hate It Or Love It Remix (Just Because Game And Buck were on the record). And outta control.I suggest everyone who wants to buy the album, to buy the collector's edition version of the album, because the video game trailer is way better than the actual album."
1,50 Cent - The Massacre,"Sorry, but 50 Cent has OFFICIALLY sold out. He used to be decent when his Get Rich Or Die Trying album came out. But this? Wow, he criticized Ja Rule for making love type songs with girls. Then what does he do on this album? He does the SAME THING! Sell out, sell out sell out. Man. This album is straight garbage. Some of the tracks on this album has decent beats. But the lyrics, man 50 whats wrong with you. Especially using Ghostface Killahs ""Metal Lungies"" beat, the F you think you doing?Dont support wack music, save your money and find some real hip-hop elsewhere!"
2,50 S@#T - The MESS-acre,Hmmm Let's see a man selling millions of albums because of this? am I missing something here? Why do people really like 50 Cent Oh yeah that's right because he dissed Ja Rule back in 2003 then he went on tv pouring his little heart and soul out tellin peoplehow he was shot 9 times and then he went on making a whole album about. If that's what take a hot rapper nowadays then shiiiit we in trouble.
1,I'm not one for rap but come on!,"I like rap, don't get me wrong, but all artists/actors/celebrities are much more likeable if they don't carry a lot of hype. That's all I read about anymore is who 50 is feuding with and seeing on TV so called inside looks on his life before he became a rapper. I personally don't care who 50 is feuding with...seems to me he's a bit too oversensitive. Anyway, this CD seems exactly like his last one. I like ""In the Club"" and ""P.I.M.P."" but that about does it for me. He should have just released that CD and left well enough alone."
1,You Gotta Be Joking.,"Yeah, first of all, nice cover. In the original shot Fitty was looking a trifle weak, so they had to draw on all the muscles...lol. Same thing applies to the tracks. God, this album SUCKS. Don't get me wrong, I hated his first also, I think 50 Cent may actually be legally retarded, and his getting shot multiple times doesn't make his crap any more compelling to me personally. If you have absolutely no idea what real music is, or if you're just the typical toy who buys/downloads anything with cheap generic rinky-dink beats and wanna-be ""gangsta"" lyrics so that you can feel like you, too, are some kind of badass, go for it, I'm sure this BS will sell in the millions anyway. No accounting for tastes.."
2,"Two stars for ""Hate it or Love It"" (remix)","This album is over 20 tracks of absolute garbage. Some beats are nice, but the lyrical content is so elementary. He should have had more guest appearances to help him out lyrically. He'll still go multi-platinum but eventually it's going to get old...just like Eminem."
1,Just Call It Quits,"I'm sorry I had to do this to G-Unit but this CD just wasn't hype enough I mean there's only 1 or 2 good songs on this whole damn album. Waste of my money. Oh I got it for $5, so sorry 50 but I was so excited bout your album got it bootlegged but still I found out that this was a waste of my time. G-G-G-G-Unot!"
1,Err.,"This album is doing so well on the charts, how?Then again, it's recieving bad and rave reviews because it is bad."
2,It sucks,I'm going to sell this album for 50 cent just to get rid of it few songs have a moment but it sucks in general. Get Young Buck or The Game instead.
2,It's A'ight,"this album is not too good. I've listened to the full album once in my life. the reason I haven't been listening to it is because it stinks. There is only 2 good songs I kind of like, which is Get in My Car, and Candy Shop. The rest stink, no doubt about it. I turn on the music, I hear the intro, In my hood comes on, I'm sleeping standing up, BORING,zzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,Good album...but has flaws,"When I got this album I was scared it was going to be garbage because of the song ""Candy Shop"". Turns out I was wrong. 50 still keeps it going with tight ass songs like ""Piggy Bank"" and ""Toy Soldier"". This album is pretty damn good. The only downfall for this album that makes me dislike it is ""Candy Shop"" what a horrible song."
4,"""Massacre"" doesn't kill anyone, but it's still pretty good.","How good is 50 Cent's highly anticipated sophomore album ""The Massacre ?"" It depends on how you look at it. In comparison with it's predecessor, the classic debut ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"", it's a mediocre offering that fails to live up to it's title. But judged as it's own singular entity, it's one of the best rap albums of the year, featuring great production which, paired with 50's talent for writing catchy hooks, catches the listerners ear and makes him listen. And keep listening. And keep listening. And keep..."
1,utterly retarded,"I think that the title sums up this POS pretty well. Let's face it. This guy has the IQ of a retarded sea cucumber. He can't even enunciate words like ""rental"". he raps about the same things over and over and over again, he's utternly tone deaf, and worst of all,. he actually thinks he's cool. Stay away from this excremental and pathetic work of stupidity. Please."
1,Just Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"50 has lost his mind now. He attacks Fat Joe, Jada, Shyne, and even Nas (the undisputed king of new york). 50 is a fake thug who only comes up in the news when he's getting attacked, you never here about him victimizing anyone, you just hear about him being the victim. You only hear about him getting shot, stabbed, and putting restraining orders out on murder inc. Just like TI says, ""All that gangsta s*** you talking, yeah it sound good but make it understood you gon have to show me."" He has limited rhymes and he's a fool to think he's at the top of the rap game, he's not even in my top 10. If there is a such thing as committing career suicide, he just did it."
1,EGOMANIAC,"alright this cd is as plain as this, boo. this nigga 50 is talkin bout how he changed the rap game with his great albums. listen he only got one cd and he thinks he is the best ever, and that first cd wasnt that great. and trust me this new one is wack. he got the nerve to go on radio and tell out rappers record sales when this nigga only got record sales off a one album. this cd will probably sell off of hype and thats it cuz once people pop it in its disappointment. so straight up buy The Game's album because its the most diverse cd on the market right now!"
3,It really ain't about the persona,"Forget about the posturing, this is about pop music. It doesn't matter how you feel about rap and its negative image, this is about catchy music that can get maximumm spins on the radio. 50 is one of the smartest rappers out there; he understands that the key to getting your songs played on the radio and maintaining strong record sales is to write catchy, hook-heavy rap songs. No matter how much you may hate him or love him, you cannot deny his flow."
2,I didn't really enjoy it...,"I just can't figure what's wrong, but this album just doesn't appeal to me. I think the songs sound pretty much the same, with their medium tempos, medium beats and almost flat choruses. ""Disco Inferno"" is fun, but after a few listens it just fades away. And everyone seems to love ""Candy Shop"" (it did rule the chart for 9 weeks, didn't it?) but I think it is nothing special. The beat doesn't even make me bop my head, and the background sound (kind of Asian sound, I think) doesn't fit the beat. Even the chorus is not as infectious as that of ""21 Questions"". The current hit, ""Just A Lil' Bit"" also doesn't stick to my ears, I just can't distinguish it from all other rap songs out there. So what's going on? 50 Cent has lost his creativity? Only with his second album? What a pity, because I really like his first release, and I thought he would become one of the most influencing rappers in the future. Better luck next time, pal."
3,Few good songs but way to mainstream for any real rap fan,Download these songs---Top 51.) My Toy Soldier2.) Just a lil bit3.) Hate it or love it (Remix)--Youngbuck's part is sick4.) Get In My Car5.) In My Hood
3,aight....,"yeah, u gotta give 50 his props, this album is pretty good, but no match to get rich or die tryin. i think 50 has gotta stop tryin to start stuff wit people and rap about whats reallll...."
1,straight up garbage,"dont get me wrong his first album was tight..but now 50's doin exactly what he's dissed Ja-Rule for doin....he's crossed over and went ""pop"" and MTV..he's singin his own hooks and only makin music for the clubs...if any of ya'll think this is real hip hop..u need to educate yourself to the culture...50 continues to hate and trys to bring every emcee down with him...he shouldnt have titled this album the ""massacre"" but instead ""the downfall"" 50 better come hard with his next album or he's destined to fall off....u want a good CD from the G-Unit camp pick up Buck's ""Straight Outta Cashville"""
3,Pop Artist!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I was looking forward on this album ever since he dropped his last one G.R.O.D.T. That album was bomb!!!!!!!In The Dvd ""Beef"" 50 disses Ja. Saying Ja. Is A pop Artist That Ja. Does Duets, Love Ballads..... I Wanna Get To Know You , 21 questions, smile, lloyd banks karma, so amazing those are also love ballads, duets so amazin that song sounds like that Could Be a Ja Rule song 50 doing love ballads he hates Ja. but deep in his heart he wants to be Ja. I aint no Ja rule fan either Im just telling it how it is so take that. its a average album The Game's CD is much better than 50's So get that one another good album is xzibit's weapon's of mass destruction & the reason 50 sells is cause he has dr. dre in his team lets put it this way Em' brought you out Dre' made you hot now your running like you'z a big shot ""P@*&y.........."
1,0.0stars,The worst put together album of all time. I like real music. This really is absolute crap. If you like this you are obviously a white kid from the burbs.
1,LADIES AND GENTLMEN...THIS IS NOT HIP HOP,"Commercial Hip Hop is a disgrace to the hip hop culture. Hip Hop began as intelligent music...and for some stupid reason, went downhill."
1,Ridiculous....,"Wow.......if you actually think 50 cent is a good rapper, then I feel sorry for you. His lyrics sucks, his voice is annoying, and the beats are WAY overproduced. The only reason why it will sell is because of Dre and Em producing the tracks, creating and publicizing him. The ONLY reason why it will sell is because of one) stupid teenie club songs and two) All the beef is talking is going to draw attention to his new albumn, WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE DISSING EVERYONE!? Including The Game..? He's so pathetic. He IS worse than Ja Rule, G Unit is tight, 50.....? Omfg. He's a joke."
2,Same Old Stuff,"This was one of the most unoriginal albums I have ever listened to. 50 has absolutely nothing relevant to talk about. Every song says 3 things I still sell drugs, Im gonna shoot you and I'm a pimp. Oh yeah and how much money I have. every song sounds the same and it all sounds like his first song and every chorus he writes for g-unit. Game is the only hope for that crew. What is even more dissapointing is the track eminem produced, piss poor. Also if 50 is going to attack every rapper from NYC he better come harder than that. If your looking for some descent production with stupid rhymes this cd is perfect for you."
1,For Real?,"isn't he some 1-hit-wonder for his song ""in da club"" from 2 or 3 years ago?50...ur NOT THE GREATEST RAPPER!and after looking at reviews, yah...Emma's ""Free Me"" album is a great! so is Brooke Valentine! Nivea! Toni Braxton! Amerei! and so on...BUT NOT 50!"
1,Good for burning,".....What the hell is this crap. Utter garbage. I mean 50 is not the best lyrical rapper, but come on. Gatman and Robbin....wtf is that? CLICKITY CLANK....uh no sucka, shaddup now. Tracks worth listening to are In my hood, candy shop and disco inferno and I suggest you download them. Not one song on here is worth spending any cash whatsoever. God Bless the internet for allowing people like ME to download this garbage 2 weeks in advance. I can't wait for Nas and Jadakiss to put this cocky arrogant punk in his place. Oh is it going to be nice, good times are ahead people. Peace."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY,I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS REALLY SHORT THIS CD SUCK IT SUCK REALLY BAD MY GRANDMA CAN RAP BETTER THEN 50 CENT DOES IN THIS CD.
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"50 cent is garbage. He is no good. He is doing this for the money. He was WAY better when he was underground. If oyu guys want to hear the real 50 cent, listen to his old cd's. BUT, do not buy this cd."
1,"Lame, boring, and flat out BAD","This is possibly one of the worst (so-called) rap albums to come out in the recent decade (that's right, not the year, month or week - but the decade!). Typical recylcled trash, disguised as music. You have been warned!!!!"
1,An Honest Review,"LISTEN UP PEOPLE!!!!!This entire week you can go to MTV.com and preview the ENTIRE cd on ""the Leak"". I implore you to do so. This cd is weak AT BEST! The tracks ""I'm Supposed To Live Tonight"", ""Disco Inferno"", and ""Hate It Or Love It(G Unit Remix)"" are the only songs that you might want to hear more than once. I'm not a hater of 50 cent. I believe he's talented artist, but this cd was just a waste of his time and, if you purchase it, your money."
1,hustle harder,"50 is a hustler. The only reason he beefs with other rappers is to clear the field and be able to sell the same crap they sell. Like your friendly neighbourhood pusher. Hey, got some beats from suppliers, got distributon and go! He is not an artist, he is a hustler with badly cut coke in a good neighbourhood. Otherwise, album is whack. Don't be surprised to find special ""G-Unit"" edition Twinkies in your supermarket very soon."
1,NO STAY AWAY FROM THIS,This cd is not worth your hard earned money i can not tell how bad this cd is. He was never that great in the first place and he is not going to get any better in the future. But little white kids are going to the stores and buying this cd and it is due to hype. To people who are considering buying this album do not i repeat do not it is not worth your money.
1,WOW,"50 cent is one of the worst rappers to hit a recording studio almost as bad as Webbie. I see some people wrote ""I bet people did not even listen to the album they just heard the singles and thought it was soft"". Well i listened to the whole album and my IQ dropped 83 points it was that retarded of an album. The only reason this sells is because white people think their cool when blasting this in their vehicles. I will never purchase a G Unit affiliated album ever again even if I like the artist because I know 50 will be on it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!"
2,GET RICH AND STOP TRYIN,"Even though 50 cent isn't a great MC i still expected much more on this album. Infact, i can't even lie but his first album ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" was actually a really good CD. 50 has gone further down the Ja Rule path, singing on almost every track and trading in much of the gangsta imagery which made him popular in the first place for a ladies man persona. He should have named this album ""Get Rich and Stop Tryin'."" A lot of Fifty's songs are deriviative of himself. Nothing on the album is outstanding even Eminem's guest appearance is lack luster. If you absolutely must have some Aftermath gangsta ish pick up The Game or Young Bucks. Avoid this album if you can."
1,this sucks,"First of all not under13 ok!well any ways,this album sucks this is not rapping.Now every one wants to take the spots of biggie and tupac.If they would be here g-unit would not even be as big as it is right now.50 thinks he is all better than game but you need to fase the truth GAME IS BETTER!!!He could say that he wrote the whole album but who cares its all about Game.So dont waste your money on this crap and spend more money on tupac.GO OAKLAND RAIDERS!!!!"
1,Save Your Money Folks...1.5 Stars!,"Where ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" was innovative with fresh beats, good hooks and a passable flow, this CD is flat, fuzzy, and the rappin' is straight pre-school! I know some people are just about the beats, but the rappin' should say something too! And 50 cents has nothing new to say! Artists are suppose to grow from one project to the next, not regress!If you only want straight beats and don't care about anything else then buy this CD, but if you want mad grooves and a decent flow (I won't even say great word flow because 50 ain't no Tupac, Nas or Mos Def), then save your money 'cuz there's nothing here!"
1,"I hate 50 Cent, straight and to the point","Hey 50, shot nine times, having trouble with The Game or whatever the f*ck his name is? Tell you what homes, I let you ride wid my crew and den Ill let you shoot up some of my rivals you eard?Ha ha ha, thats me trying to be all gangster, but believe me I am more hardcore than any wannabee wanksta this side of the Mississippi.I hate 50 cent ever since he made that damn lollypop song, that piece of sh*t has been in my head ever since and I need good songs like alternative rock and Eminem mixed together to get it out of my head.A friend of mine said she hates 50 Cent because he doesn't treat women right, I tend to agree, but then again I try to focus myself on hooking up with her as well, so I'll say anything with her around.Hey 50, dawg if you want you can go lick your own lollypop you eard? Later homie g, we'll let the roof burn down, flap our wings, lean back, shake our tailfeathers, and get our eagles on on the West side!Aiight!!!!"
1,50 aint good no more,don't get this cd. it's a waste of money. His first cd dominates this one. Get a actual good cd like lil wayne- tha carter or Do or Die-DOD
1,dont believe the hype,50 is now 25. He got rich now hes not trying. the massacre sucks. not like get rich or die tryin thats good.
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,albums like this make me sick. and they're gunna continue to be made because idiots actually buy them. not even close to real hip hop
4,Not as strong as Get Rich but still worth owning,When I look at what happened between 50 and the Game I wonder how much better this album could have been. 50 claimed to have helped Game on 6 of his tracks and can be heard on 3 including Hate it Or Love it my favorite from the Documentary. All the songs that 50 says he helped out on are some of my favorites and would have made this one near 5 mic status. Out of 21 tracks on this album I find a VERY solid 8 tracks worth listening to and that's without Piggy Bank Disco Inferno and Candy Shop. And God Gave me Style is one of my favorites to just sit back and relax to. I took that song and burned it on a mix CD and was playing it in front of a friend who really hates 50. He liked that song so much that he went out and bought the album. If he had kept the Game songs on this album I think over half these posts wouldn't be here.
2,g-unot. 50 cent is garbage. waste management comin on wednesday. better throw away the album,the singles on this track are hot. i give him that. that was 1 star. the rest is garbage. took away 3 stars. now the only good things on this album are the beats by all the hot producers. tahts 1 star.the only good verse 50 cent ever made was victory 2004 because it wasnt his own style.i was anxious of buying this album. after the hour listening. shoot i listened to 5 minutes and turned it off. gwen stefani's hollah back girl is better than this.
1,"my how this album is terrible, not even worthy of a 1 star","disregard the 1 star rating because this thing is in the negative, i'm really disgusted with the state of hip hop and hope that good rappers will get to shine in the spotlight one day and not talentless bums like this, i agree with matt c check out the new Common cd, and Sean Price, Madlib, C Ray Walz and Perceptionists cds, if you made the mistake of buying this cd put it to good use as a coaster"
3,WOW,"Yay, this is the first mutli platinum selling cd ive seen that has a rating of 2.5 stars!Hmmm...maybe if people keep rating him 1 star his rating will eventually drop to 1 star and people would not buy his next album...wait...NO"
1,50 Cent = Crap A Legend In his Right Hand,"50Cent is a bunch of bs hype,the guy can't even go without a song saying he is going to kill someone ha ha. 50 tries to pass himself as a legend when in reality he is a Chingy, Nelly type Bubble Gum Rapper. Just Listen To his Rhymes on his tracks,if you know rap,G-Unit homeboys you know the guy can't rap."
3,Watered Down Ja Rule Album CB4 Ass CD,"He talks all that trash about how ja rule sings on track and has nothing but girl tracks, and basically thats what this whole album is. The album is ok but I don't think its better than ja's and he copied the same format as ja with how his album tracks are with the serious tracks into the ""larry love"" type tracks. Its an alright album to have but only for the moment theres only a few songs on the album you can listen to but others are just annoying to listen to. 50 got alittle too cocky on this album cause he slacked off and made a watered down ja rule album.i'm suppose to die tonight, candyshop,this is 50 are the only solid tracks on this album.For who he claims to be this album was on some regular shelf filler type cd.p.s. your reign on top is short like leprechauns"
3,I want the Instrumental version. HIP-POP at its finest.,"I'm not just going to recklessly hate on 50 because of personal beefs, so I'll say that this is the nature of the business of Hip-POP today. There are millions of dollars involved today so rappers try to give people what they want, and if they want shoot-em-up, icey, rollin' on dub nonsence let 'em have it. You don' have to listen to it so don't. With that being said, now we know why 50 needed to start more drama with Fat Joe & Jadakiss before this release. At least with GET RICH... he could rap about being shot the hell up. His subject matter is quite suspect on MASSACRE but these are some of the sickest beats I've heard in a Hip-Pop release since GET RICH... That's all I'll say. If you want ignorant (...), look no further."
1,All fur coat and no knickers,"It blows I say. 50 Cent's life story sure seems fascinating, but hey why not wait for the bio since his music is so desecrating?"
3,"50 what hapend just if you got Em, and the doc dont mean a good album","I was pissed of when i heard this albun. 50's beats were terrible on most songs, and his flow was off. The Only good tracks were 6. GATMAN AND ROBIN, 9. GIT IM MY CAR, 16. MY TOY SOLDIERS FT. TONY YAYO, AND 5. PIGGY BANK. If you want a good 50 album listen to POWER OF A DOLLAR OR GUESS WHO'S BACK."
3,im dissapointed,"dang 50 wat happened to u man? u were my favorite rapper dawg. this makes me cry . get rich or die tryin was way better then this garbage. Piggy Bank is not wat i was expecting from u. that song sucks way more then Back Down. u have gotten really bigheaded for some reason. ur not the same nigga from the block u used to be . the massacre sucks . the game is way better then 50 Cent . go buy the documentary . candy shop sucks . disco inferno u get tired of after listenin to it after the 3rd time. just a lil bit is gettin really old . man im still ridin in my car listenin to in da club , back down, blood hound, lifes on the line. 50 u suck dawg"
1,This Album is Pathetic.,"The reason we are hating this loser, because he is just like young cheezy and other garbage today, he's truly dreadful, awful and absolutely lame and this extremely pathetic album defintely proves it, none of these songs are good, the production is terrible, the lyrics are so intrusive, the rapping is horrible, everything about this album is stupid, dreadful and idiotic and wack.This is absolutely the year's worst album and I Truly hope that 5-0 fades off in the next few years, once vh1's where are they now makes fun at him and his stupid group.This album is the most ugliest and most pathetic and incomprehensible I've ever seen.If you want a real gangsta rap album, go pick 2pac's all eyez on me or Nas's Last year's masterpiece street disciple.Keep away from this junk as possible.5-0 Represents everything wrong with music now a days.Music Review: NO STARS."
3,Worst Cd G unit has put out to date,"This is no where near as good as ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" or any of his mixtape work. This album is weak and I suggest that you dont go get it unless it is on sale. Massacre is an average cd. It is the worst Cd from G-unit to date. This tells you how good Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and The Game's debut cds were if this cd is the worst and is still an average album"
4,this is only a review of a few songs,"i haven't heard the full album, so i can't tell u about all of it. but the part of the cd that i've heard is pretty good. So far, the award for best song goes to- tie between gatman and robbin and Hate it or love it remix, but the remix wins out slightly b/c of all the different voices in it. gatman and robbin is pretty good, with a great beat. i really like em's verse. its great. In my hood is okay, and it gets stuck in your head pretty quickly. Piggybank is horrible, don't listen to it. a batltimore love thing sucks too. the album's not bad, but its not great."
1,God what has music come to,"God what crap!how do people call this music?Im tired of seeing so much rap everywhere,this is one of the worst trends ever.What do people see in this ,the lyrics basicly are all bragging about how tough he is or sex.Maybe I dont understant something but how can someone turn down a pink floyd cd for this crap.He cant even playing an instrument but people call this music and somehow the recording industry keeps signing these no-talent rappers instead of talented musicains who actually make their own music.Please never get a rap album in your life and stick to good music that's thoughtful and talented like pink floyd,led zeppelin,iron maiden,judas priest,jimmy hendrix,van halen,etc."
1,This Album TRUELY SUCKS!,I can't don't even have much to say besides the fact that it sucks. SP has a mixtape out called Super Mario that is hotter than this album. He has about two tracks on this album that are good. But this album is a dissapointment to fans and the hip-hop community. Spend your money elsewhere.... If you buy the album you'll wish you hadn't. The first album was hot. This one is a dud!
1,its all about the moneyh,this cd has proven that 50 cent has officially sold out and is all about the money...i was a big fan of 50 before he became popular because of his clever lyrics...this album is just complete garbage and is a disgrace to the rap industry...
1,Biggest disappointment of the year,"This album was surprisingly horrible. Not like 50's a good rapper or anything but he usually has the ability to make a pretty hot song. This album is wack compared to ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" and I think 50's overconfidence in the rap game has costed him big on this one. Game's album was way better and, in my opinion, was the best album to come out of G-Unit. The sad thing is this album will prolly go platinum within the first week. That just shows you where rap is headed and what people want nowadays. Its not lyrics and actual talent anymore. I'll be looking forward to Fat Joe and Styles' new albums coming soon. It's time someone shut 50 down."
1,not that good,"I did get tha CD bootleg but this by far is tha weakest 50 cent album i have heard so far i mean i was a die hard 50 fan after get rich or die tryin but since then lloyd banks and tha Games cd's are both killin this massacre cd. I wish i could give a better review but i cant, to me it was WEAK>."
1,50 Cent is horrible!!!!!!!,Anybody that ever thought that 50 cent was good rapper was wrong. Listen to this album and you will know what I mean. It sucks. His mono-tone rapping style is enough to put me to sleep. He has no style.
1,Waste Of Fittys breath he might need it when he gets shot,the CD is worthless junk. Fat joe and jaddakiss are alot better at raping they have much better flow. Fat joes response to piggy bank is the hotnesss iiiiiiiiiiight
1,dud,"this is horrible, and i dont think amazon is showing my reviews but w/e there is other people who reviewed this the same as me and there reviews said it was wack."
4,"Better Than ""Get Rich of Die Tryin'.""","Even though I am not a big fan of rap, I listened to 50's sophomore project, ""Massacre,"" and I was impressed.""Disco Inferno,"" the first single from this album, was not all that great, but ""Candy Shop"" featuring Olivia was a great tactic to get 50's solo career back on the map. About two months later, this was followed by ""Just a Lil' Bit"" which proved to be a club-banger everywhere. I still hear this single on the radio and I can't get enough of it because of the great job done by producer Scott Storch (""Lean Back"" by Fat Joe).I would like to see ""Outta Control"" or ""Get in My Car"" as the next single from his album, both are very good."
4,Good album but 50,"This is a good album but it's still the same, i was expecting more from 50, he still raps about beefing, 50 grow the (Cencord) up your beefing isn't gonna do anything, have you heard a response from ja no because probably he doesn't care 50 take a break and just chill with the beef stuff someone already left your group and is now screamimg G-unot"
3,MEH,"it was gd, best songs wer candy shop, disco inferno, jus a lil bit n outta control.but it was no neer as gd a get rich or die tryin"
1,whats this? no more talent?,Now I read most of the reviews on this site for this new cd of 50s and after hearing it I agree with most of them this cd proves that when rappers get rich they get lazy. The lyrics in this cd are boaring and tasteless I wasnt supprised however considering this happens with a lot of rappers and now it seems like the mainstream followers are starting to open their eyes a little. Now other ppl are posting that they are not hateing but I am the first to say I am this cd blows Ill stick with the underground shit
2,Ok CD,This CD is way under what 50 is capable of. His mixtape 2050: Before the Massacre is way better. This is a good cd to have in your collection but dont expect it to bring it like Get Rich or Die Tryin. 50 could do way better.Hot Songs1. Disco Inferno2. Piggy Bank3. My Toy Soldier4. Candy Shop5. Get In My Car6. Hate it or Love it remix (not even a 50 song).My suggestion for a flamin rap cd: The Game's The Documentary
1,one of the worst cd`s in hip hop !!!!!!,"the cd is very bad. It has no flow, the lyrics asre stypid, the images are bad.........everything is bad only 3 songs are good ...13..19...22 !!!!!! IF YOU LIKED GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN` DON`T BUY THIS CD !!!!!"
3,Not as good as expexted,Me and my homeboyz downloaded this cd in computer class for free expecting it to be a hot ass cd. It's straight and you can tell it's a commercial cd because it'ss two hotest songz are disco inferno and candy shop the rest of the album is okay piggy bank was not one of the best diss songs i've ever heard but it's sill good and Gatman and Robin is a funny track to me but there's no need for it. What i don't get is how u can speed two years on a cd then brag about it than it doesn't be that good
2,cmon now,basically all 50 did was remixed for the most part his first cd...and piggybank is so funny he tried to diss but it was stupid i mean take a note from other og rappers and if yr going to take the time out and diss somebody DISS them...as u can see im not a 50 fan i listen to REAL rappers people who actually do what they say...not rappers who main buyers r kids growing up with baggy pants wearing a back pack singing they gang bang....hes a descent rapper but face he got shot n didnt shoot back cmon now his crew didnt get back for him..so plz little boys and girls before you try and tell people 50 is gangsta go back and listen to gangsta rap that came out b4 u were born then tell me if hes hot stop trying to make comparisons of pac and biggie cuz 50 couldnt even dream of being in their league...and for the youngstaz even go back as far as nwa who started gangsta rap and brought to the mainstream the only group to be pulled of shelves cuz they were to gangsta
3,haters,"the reviewer below obviously doesnt like hip hop. He hates the fact that a guy from the hood is successful. He hates rap in general.This album is a good album. A bit long, but 50 has the cream of the crop in his side with production. In my hood is a good start, and Needlz kills it with piggy bank.If u like hissingles u'd like his album, 50 is good at making catchy hooks and choruses that people can sing along too. And that takes talent. This album is not all abot guns, hoes etc, the last reviewer obviously hasnt even listened to this. Ofcourse it has thatelement , but that was part of his past so hes gonna talk about it right?All in all a solid album."
1,I HATE CURTIS THE SNITCH JACKSON,"lets review this with a line from jadakiss diss Checkmate"" you aint get shot again yea so whats your second album about, nothing your raps is preschool made alot of money now be cool before i swell up ya lips like seafood""""Most likely ya new cd is a weed play, bunch of lovesongs 100% pure garbage just something to break up buds on you should just sell clothes and sneakers cause out of ya camp your flows the weakest"
1,Ummm.......No.,"This is just awful. Words can not express how much I hate this man and his ""music"". Not worth your time or money."
1,Given a chance.,"This collection of rhymes is repellant, at best. The sampling is as deplorable as are the sexist lyrics. This type of music although leaves me happy for one right: The freedom to crack the disc. I gave this rubbish a chance. Not a good ambassador for this genre of music."
1,"Evolution did happen, 50 is proof","Rat toothed, no intelligence and boring,repetitive lyrics all describe 50 cent. The songs are so cliche it's humerous. The lyrics that 50 rap about either include one of the following : murder, lyrics degrading women, talking about another rapper. Seriously, if you are looking for art, bypass this album. This is not art, it's just a commerially made, lifeless piece of junk with no soul at all. I wouldn't doubt if it takes 5 minutes to make stuff like this."
2,awful awful,"terrible album, not a real disaster like Tony Yayo's album, but still only 3 or 4 enjoyable tracks on this whole album. THUMBS DOWN!"
2,The Massacre is dead before it hits the floor,"50 Cent didn't get shot again, so what's his new album about?Nothing, a bunch of love songs, 100% garbage. 50 Cent comes off as an adolescent who has discovered sex for the first time - he has to keep on popping off at the jaw about it. Lacks anything close to Dre."
1,This Album isnt worth a penny!,I admit Get Rich Or Die Tryin was a good album but this SUCKED! There are about 2 good beats on this album but that is it. 50 Cent is terrible all he talks about is how he got shot 9 times and says G-unit. He is going to get old soon. I wasted 15 bucks. The Game is killin him! G-UNOT!
1,this needs to be put put with tuesdays trash!!!,"wow how should i begin? this is one of the most higly anticipated albums of the year and yet it is so garbage. his first cd was off the chain i could let it ride from front to back but this mess is just down right terrible .i dont reccomend paying full price for this cd and if u are one of those people that just have to go buy this cd go to a cd resell shop because there are so many there that they wouldnt even by my copy back.I cant believe this came out of gunits camp especially since all the previous cd's that they have put out have been pretty good (with the exception of young buck) but what can u expect from a record label that signs one hit wonder olivia ,and thrives off of publicity stunts for record sales(game n 50 beef). I thought 50 had a few rapping skills until i put this cd in the deck, THIS IS GOING OUT WITH MY GARBAGE !!!! OR MAYBE I WILL LET MY DOG CHEW ON IT!!"
3,Decent Album - Haters quit the drinking the HATORADE.,"I think the Album is Decent. It will not sell 11 million but will probably sell 4-5 million just because of all the news that has been surronding him lately. He is definitely lacking Dre on this Album, but gets some decent work from producers like HiTek(who everyone sleeps on)- Best Track - Ryder Music. He definitely will not take a two year hiatus next time.I lot of this beef could be a plublicity stunt by Interscope. They are selling records off the chain. Why not stir something up to get all the interscope artist records selling. Remember alot of the artist that he's beefing with are on Interscope.. Wait and See... Pick up the Album..."
1,Manufactured rappers...ENRICHING MY LIFE AND OTHER KID'S LIVES EVERYWHERE!!!,"OMG! OMG! OMG! This CD is great! I know 50 cent is good cu he get play o MTVi round cloc! Tha tu 50, I now unerstan that it IS okay to smoke weed an join gangs an kill peepul an swair evey momen I git an raip women! I dunno how me eva get thru li wiout MTV a 50 a rap al toegetha! F*** Pink Floyd an Aerosmith! They don't git plai o MTV so eveyboiy now they cat be gud!Hopefully you didn't take any of that seriously, listen to REAL music(in no particular order) like:PINK FLOYDROLLING STONESGREEN DAYRADIOHEADTHE KILLERSAEROSMITHMY CHEMICAL ROMANCETHE PRETENDERSJANIS JOPLINJONI MITCHELLDAVID BOWIEDEPECHE MODEEARTH WIND FIRENINE INCH NAILSU2PEARL JAMOh and to MTV ROCKS, all the bands that you think are ""posers"" actually inspired all those bands you think are good but are really posers(awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, the truth hurts, doesn't it?), and 1 more thing MTV ROCKS, just know that I will remember you .............."
1,Very disapointed!!!!!!!!,"Do not waste your money on this CD. I gave it a chance I tried to like it, but it is horrible I had to skip through the songs because they suck so bad. the only good songs were disci inferno & jus a lil bit, and the other radio hits that are already played out on the radio. If u really want it burn it don't waste your money. Lloyd banks and Game have way better albums. I recommend them instead."
1,Wanna listen to music worth under 50 cents?,"To be quite honest, if I could rate the album at 0 that would be my #1 option.No offense 50 Cent, but u need to find a new job - advising people on what cars they should buy, or advising celebrities in movies on how to throw money in the air or working at a candy shop. There, you can let girls lick ur lollipop without having it told to 50 million MTV viewers.The hype of excitement and anticipation put on the album was the only thing that got it this far. The quite lame lyrics and derogatory and sick statements such as 'I'll let u lick the lollipop' on 'Massacre' are hopefully going to make people realize that not much has changed about 50 Cent since his debut 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' album, which will hopefully also lead them to realize that 50 Cent is a WASTE OF MONEY!So basically what I'm trying to tell those reader's is that you should save you're money (and ears)."
2,Another fly by night rapper!,"This cd is ok. I could not understand why there are pictures of guns on the inside cover. I used the insert to wrap my fish! Nice image for the kids talking about shooting people , and someone licking your lolipop! Total garbage as far as content. Let the code of the steets take care of itself. This sucka mc talking about murdering people is a disgrace. Who gives a rats fanny if you were shot 9 times. That is nuthin to be proud of. There is nuthin new or fresh on this cd. No growth as an artist.The rap community does not need this negative type of music. Some of the beats are good on the cd , but 50 cent does not rhyme clear to me. A lot of his words are bunched together. Thisfake rapper wont be around along. Not a Hip Hop legend here."
1,Just awful,"This has got to be the worst rap album in history. He doesn't express any feelings whatsoever. I mean, it's fine that he's talking about goodies, but at least do it with emotion. This album should only be for ghetto flags. Because only a flag in the grass living in the ghetto would buy such a crappy album.Go get an Eamon, Akon, or Eminem album. Spend your money elsewhere!LAST WORD: This sux."
1,You have got to be kidding!,"This hip hop disc is an exercise in poor taste and poor choices. Surely, it lacks creativity and has nothing constructive to say about bettering our world. Bad attitude; bad music; bad idea. Drugs, sex and weapons? Please, keep this stuff to yourself!!!Bring a message of hope to the people!"
2,Not any where near get rich or die tryin,"This album doesn't have any good beats! There are like a couple of tracks that stand out to me 10.Ski Mask Way 11.A Baltimore Love Song. The rest is like album fillers. It almost seems like 50 didn't even try to make this album lyricly he isn't using the word play and punch lines he used to. I think he needs to take more time consintrating on writing his raps like he used to rather then braging about how much money he's got in interviews and how much other artist sold. Also don't get it twisted I am not a G UNIT Hater at all I own every one of there cd's and mixtapes before there deal plus Get Rich Or Die Tryin ,Beg for Mercy ,Banks ,Buck's and former G Unit Member The Game and they are all better then The Massacare ."
2,Tired,I'm so mad I don't even want to review it. I wasted my money on this stuff. 'Nuff said. The other better and more extensive reviews will explain just why this has so few stars beside it.
4,I hate 50. but this isnt all that bad,"seems like the critics like his album but the fans dont.All i no that its much better than his 1st commercial album (grodt) This album is much more varied and its not so poppyeveryone is sayin its crap is cuz people have seen that it isnt instantly lovable like GETRICH, it takes time to get into, this is a good thing, this means that it takes longer 2 get into cuz it isnt so catchy so then once u getinto it, it will last longer and the beats dont get boring quicklyBEST=disco infernopiggy bankcandy shophate it or love it(not as good as OG)god gave me graceamaizingin the hoodgood effort, shame that the actual man is a complete w*nker"
2,First Album was MUCH better,"This album sucked. GRODT was much hotter and did not have any skippable tracks. I am also angry at 50 for getting rid of The Game, who is a lyrically better rapper. Candy Shop is WAY overplayed and Disco Inferno is a retarded club anthem. He wants to prove he is the greatest rapper from NY, so he disses the other great NY rappers (Nas, Jadakiss, Shyne). So why not dis the fake NY MC's, such as Cam'ron, Mobb Deep or Fabolous? The only good songs on here are God Gave Me Style, Gatman And Robbin' feat. Eminem and Outta Control. I was also hoping to get the second G-Unit album, but now that The Game is officially gone, I think I'll keep my $15 to 20 dollars."
1,This Album Made Me Hate Rap,"I used to be the hugest fan of 50. Get Rich or Die Tryin was nothing below awesome. To tell the truth, i am completely off rap now. i dont know why he went down the path of such a bad 2nd coming.I'll to take 50 to the brain shopSomething made his head go pop"
4,"NOt as good as Get Rich or Die Tryin', but captivating nevertheless.","Man, i expected more because his first album was ALL HITS! but this one had many highlights as well, most notably ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"". Basically The Only Songs that are skippable are ""This Is 50"", ""A Baltimore Love Thing"", ""Gunz Come Out"", ""My Toy Soldier"", and ""I Dont Need em"". THe rest are SOLID, this album is worth it, good job 50. GGGGUNIT!"
1,Y r some people giving this album 4 stars,"I will tell u y cause they have no taste of good music and this album is pure breed 100 percent f**king garbage it is not even worth 1 penny they should give album away for free cause it is bringing down rap and 50 is bringing down rap. I recommend that u do not buy this it is not worth it and dont support this guy he is a piece of s**t and jealous of the game that is y he kicked him out of gay-unit. To the people who gave this more than 1 star f**k u and to the haters of jadakiss,nas,fat joe and shyne suck a d**k and go get f**k in the a** by 50 cent. Anyways dont buy this please and write reviews that give this 1 star cause that is what should be rated."
4,50 cent is Blaznniinnini,"eh yo, right here, this album is hot. Why are people haters, i know its not as good as the earlier stuff, but hes tryna go back to it. The track wit Eminem is hot, the fast rapping, raw, you can't help but respect that. Most the tracks are decent, if you're lookin for some classic 50 cent, get this."
1,This album is proof that 50 Cent is an inferior human being!,"Scientists have done various studies and have come to the interesting conclusions that 50 Cent, and those of his ilk, are actually inferior to the average human being!"
1,What The Hell?,"Are you kidding me? 50 Cent delayed this record because he didnt like the way it came out and its still garbage. This is the worst CD I own 22 Tracks and there are only 3 songs worth listening to if you arent already sick of hearing them in the clubs This is really bad, I want my money back...! All this time waiting what a disapoointment... What happened?"
1,let me count the rappers that are better,"This would take a whole book to fill, so i'll keep my list semi-small...PumpkinheadSupernaturalVast AireCageRA the Rugged ManGza and the entire Wu-TangMursSlugBlueprintZion IJus AllahVinnie PazIll Bill and Non PhixionOne Be LoPhil Da AgonyDefariEvidenceC Rayz WalzMr. LifKool G RapCanibusBeanie SiegelJay-ZNasthat's a good mix of commercial and underground rappers who are better than the biggest snitch/hypocrite in the industry"
1,Dis music the bomb yo!!! Ha.. no dont get your hopes up im kidding,"Im watching tv. i come to the worst channel ever MTV. and guess who i see?? 50 Cent with his shirt off and girls hanging on his arms. guess what i hear?? "" Yo i got shot 9 fu**in' times, yo, i got my babe, yo, so f*ck u...!"" AND YOU PEOPLE CALL THAT MUSIC???"
4,Ok ... He's Got Some Talent,"I am a Gen-Xer who grew up with Rap and Hip Hop ... and while I am sick to death of these artists exploiting black women in their songs and videos I will say that there are a few of these folks who have tremendous talent. 50 cent is one of them. I don't always agree with what they say in their songs, but I can tell who's got game and who doesn't. 50 cent is all over it."
3,Not too shabby,"I don't care much for G Unit but I have to credit 50 on his choice of beatsmiths. Getting Disco D (Ski Mask Way) and Hi Tek (Ryder Music) was a good look for him. Eminem remains as one of the worst people to ever get behind a mixing board (Gatman and Robbin) but Dr Dre compensates for that with his standard G Funk take on East coast gangster rap.That's pretty much it. At least this time around he breaths some life into his rhymes, which is a change of pace since he dropped the lackluster Get Rich... where all he seems to do is spit through clenched teeth. 'Ski Mask Thing' and 'Piggy Bank' (a hark back to 'How To Rob' a veritable diss on the who's who of rap)brings me back to those 'Rowdy Rowdy' days.That being said, he's still pop corn. Buy it if you miss Hi Tek and don't sleep on Disco D, homeboy's on the come-up."
4,Good but not amazing,I like this but I only got it on wednesday! I bought along with The Game The Documentary. This was'nt what I thought it would be though! I like most of the songs but I dont like Gunz come out much! My favourite 3 rCandy ShopMy Toy SoldiersGet innto my carI have not had it long enough to propely judge it but I'm sure soon I'll give it five stars! Buy but The Games new ones a bit better than this! Buy though but soon I think I'll say this is 5 stars but for now its 4.5 stars! Peace People!R.J from Britain
1,50 this sucks,If ur buying this cd for the songs Disco inferno and Candy Shop you should instead burn those songs because the rest suck... Get rich or die trying is better then this Massacre. You see 50 cent saying that this album is way better than GRODT but its NOT. He just says that so u could buy this garbage.. Do me a favor and save your money people.
1,EXTREMELY OVERRATED!!!!!!,"I wanted to give this album 4 stars but i will not give this overrated album any more than one.amazing was the best song but even that some can't compete with ja rule. I can't beleive that 50 dissed ja of making lov songs when he can't even make that type of songs better than ja does... NOBODY DOES IT LIKE ME-THEY DO BUT THEY AIN'T DO IT LIKE ME-NOBODY, nobody DOES IT LIKE R.U.L.E......."
4,Pretty Good,"I loved this CD.I ordered and waited for it in the mail.Rushing to the mail every day and dissappointed when it didnt come.Almost Everyone says this sucks,But this is damn better than Terror Squad,Fat Joe,Ja Rule,Jakakiss, and all the other artists.The only artist that is alive that competes with 50 is The Game and Young Buck.Get this CD.It is better than Get Rich and Die Trying.The best song I like on it is:Hate It Or Love It (Remix) Ft. G-Unit.The Young Buck and 50 Cent part is the best in the song out of them all."
1,hmmmmm....documentary > the massacre,"yes the cd is a massacre because it was just terrible, the hooks the lyrics he so called beef track which was just another gimmick hook track....awful, i didnt buy it but i did hear it before it came out, so dont think i am just hating...the track that is actually good is ryder music, the beat is nice , which couldve been without 50 on it....but overall, i am not feelin game but his cd was better than 50's which is what i believe is another reason why they have....garbage....and to DALTON HIGGINS, keep kissin G-unit a**....we see who you are riding with...if ya'll want real hip hop, go pick up a CORMEGA CD..."
3,It's Aiight,"HE definately don't come with the Energy of his first album, which was a masterpiece. It seems like on the first album he was raw and had nothing to prove, like he was hard and told true hood stories, but on this album it's like he's comming off harder than he needs to be, like he's overdoing it. All the Rhymes on this album are all about makin money or bustin a cap in somebody, but at least his skills aren't rusty and he can still convey the message, and the beats are definately tight for the most part. 50 needs to work on some more messages in his songs and he just might be able to captivate the audience he once did, but this album is still worth checkin out with a couple of club bangers on it"
1,so sad and pathetic!,"Its a shame how a mere three years ago, 50 Cent was slaying the industry, bashing ""pop"" rappers such as Ja Rule for being soft. No less than 24 months later, this travesty is released with its lead single ""Candy Shop"". Just by looking at the album cover, you can figure out which market this CD is looking for (any straight dude wouldnt want to be caught dead with a CD with this art on it). No respect for the man now, this CD should have been called ""The Rape"". If your even contemplating putting a dollar towards this pop trash, cut off the blood circulation to your brain"
4,"Two of my favourite, tracks just gone!!","The Massacre special edition is good value, it has a dvd with all the vidoes to the album plus a new track.However there is one major flaw - only 21 tracks instead of 22, the ""Outta Control Remix"" is on here instead of the original as well. For some this might be a good thing but for me it is not, not that the remix is a bad song just the old one was better (and Mobb Deep don't add much to the track at all). Also there is no ""Hate it or Love it Remix"", i can understand why with 50's beef with the game and all but hate it or love it remix was the best track on the album!!All in all, the special edition is a better buy than the regular because of the DVD but if your in for the music, go the original massacre - it's better."
1,50's time has been up.,"Not a lot of people have heard anything by 50 that is pre-Get Rich. Before he hooked up with Eminem he used to be a TALENTED underground rapper. He also used to tell his fans that he would never sell out and that he hated mainstream rap. Well 50, was it worth it? You ditched all your true underground fans to go mainstream with ""Get Rich"". You got your wish and you're now rich and famous. Now what? Your TRUE fans hate you for selling out and now your teeny-bobbing fans are forgetting about you and moving on to the next rap idol. So in a desperate attempt to get them back you release ""The Massacre"". Very appropriate title for album because it describes what happened to your short-lived music ""career"". Oh well, I guess it doensn't matter to him because he's raked in his millions. Anyone who is interested in hearing pre ""Get Rich"" 50 try to find his underground tapes. He does have some good stuff, its just hard to get to."
1,The best reason yet to shot your stereo...,"This has got to be the phattest piece of trash to grace the beautiful shelves of music. All the copies of the CD should be rounded up, thrown in a big pile, lit on fire. And then the owners of those CDs should all be piled together and thrown into space, because they are the reason for the demise of human civilization.Get this crap down to negative stars!"
5,the massacre,this is the best 50 cent cd and i own all of them that other punk kid dont know what he is talking about!the whole cd is tight the only cd that is better than this one is g-unit beg for mercy
3,"But it for Ryder Music, keep it for the singles","50 Cent is not a good rapper in any sense of the word.But in that respect, he can be an effective rapper, and at one point on this album, there hints a depth, and an underlying introspective nature on this album that I'd love to hear from 50 Cent.The song Ryder Music is a promising hint at something that with enough money could free 50 Cent from his own image, and lead him into making music from his soul.One of the most beautiful beats I've ever heard courtesy of Hi-Tek, and 50 Cent's laid back, haunting delivery make this one a winner. I could play this song every day atleast five times.---Keep the album for both Out of Controls, Candy Shop, Just a Little Bit, Piggy Bank, and Gunz Come Out."
2,The massacre failed,"After good ""Get Rich Or Die Or Tryin'"" I was expecting better album from 50 cent. This cd is copy of all 50 cent's past songs. All what he saying is that how he got shot. Nothing new."
1,Wow 50 !,"50 man, you should wait for Dr. Dre man, you put an album like that man, that most be a joke man. Or I am still dreaming. 50 you rushed the album out man, and you are not even 3 stars from our reviews man... I am not hitting on you 50, but this is not hip-hop, Piggy bank is called out war man...! Please take Banks, Yayo, and Buck out of the hate it or love it, man leave it for Game son, they suck on it man... Wow, 50 I don't know which song that should be something to listen everyday man, because like their said before all sound the same, and you are not a boss, pretend to be are not a boss, wait for Dr. Dre to create what we call out real beats for you and then you rap, on track. The Game killed you man... This is album is dope even you running your little mouth, you wrote most of those songs, but The Game got a better chemestry than you 50 Cent, call JMJ again 50, asked him for a new way to rap son! I am fan in all man but this is not a G-unit album..."
2,Eh...,"I have to say that there are several good tracks on the album, and in my opinion that's the only thing that saves it. 2 songs, which are pretty good, come to my mind right away: ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"" and ""Position of Power"". The rest is generally same old stuff, nothing that haven't been said before. Most songs on the album lack substance, and lyrics are pretty mediocre. If you've listened to previous albums you will notice that 50 repeats a lot of stuff he said before, and his rhymes don't seem to change much. Well, you can go with the hype and buy this album, but honestly, it's not worth the money...Last note. If you are looking for club bangers with nice beats, and don't really care about quality of rhymes or topics covered, then I would say that this could be a decent buy. If you are looking for something deeper which actually has meaning, steer away from this album.-F1"
1,50 cent a wanksta,i can not believe what i am hearing from this guy first he went pop and he said he never would cause on a mixtape that was dissin ja rule he said he would never sellout and what did he do same thing as ja rule. this guy is a f***ing hyprocrite and needs to keep his mouth shut from now on. The Game killed gay unit on his mixtapes this year first mixtape was You Know What It Is vol 3 and the second was Ghost Unit both cds told stories of what really went down between these two guys. I recommend that you not buy this cd it is not worth the money.
1,it doesnt even deserve 1 star,"Reading alot of these reviews i now relize that rap/hip hop has somehow brainwashed you into thinking you can be rich just by getting shot and doing drugs.I see people all the time that try to act ""pimp"" its just retarded. Whatever happened to the once almighty rock?"
1,I can't believe how dense some of you people are...,"Vlad, can't you detect sarcasm when you read it? Read the rest of MTV Rocks's reviews, friend! HE'S BEING SARCASTIC. HE AGREES WITH YOU. HE DOESN'T REALLY THINK FITTY CENT IS A TALENTED HOMEY. HE'S JOKING AROUND TO MAKE HIS POINT.I just don't understand it. So many people have criticized MTV Rocks on different reviews... the guy's obviously joking around! Am I really the only one who sees this?"
1,after hearing this album i wanna shoot myself 9 TIMES!!!!!!!,TERRIBLE... 50 is the worst rapper to date.... 50 thinks he is the greatest thing since g strings and tries to start unnessecary battles that we dont need anymore....just to let you know JADAKISS will kill 50 in a battle... HANDSDOWN!!!!50 IS trying sooo friggin hard to be ja rule it does not make sense....and who does he think he is for runnin THE GAME out of g unit...basically in a nutshell... 50 is diggin his own grave he thinks he is invisible now... just wait his downfall is not too far in the future....
1,Foolish worms.,"I feel like the kid in Sixth Sense. When 50 first came out, I was could see {lame artist}. But no one else saw it. It was like everyone was brainwashed into worshiping 50 but me ! ...Now , the spell seems 2 be wearing off. Everyone's like "" ....wh...where am I ? What happened ?! This 50 album is garbage. WRONG. 50's garbage. Always has been, u just couldn't see that. Its funny 2 me though. U might think its immature of me 2 sit here and gloat ""I toldja so"" but I don't care. Theres others like me out there. That weren't pluged into the 50 cents Matrix that spread across the land. This review is for THEM. Join me in my joy, in watching these pretentious, wannabe, followers wallow over their dissapointment."
1,like hearin' the same records over and over again,"The lirics are worthless , the diss on nas and shyne ain't S**t and the beats are simular to his previos album Get rich and die trin' which a lot betta. Shyne ripped his ass with ""for the record"" and the best he came with was piggy bank. 50 yo ain't nothin' but fake G.EM , shoot him in the doom coas this b***h embarasment.peace and keep it real"
1,A nasty piece of work from a nasty piece of work,The only thing being massacred here are my ears! Mr Cent should thank his lucky stars there are so many idiots out there who are prepared to buy this rubbish.
2,50cent too much,"I gave this album 2 stars cos it has 2 good songs, Candyshop and Disco Inferno, and both of them have already been released. I couldnt wait for this album to come out, i still play Get Rich a lot cos its a classic album and i was expecting this to be good at least. I think its so bad cos Em and Dre's influence isnt there as much as it is in Get Rich, for his 1st album Em and Dre had last say on everything and produced a fantastic album, then 50 thought he was the best rapper alive with his 1 good album, decided he was a big boy now and could do it all on his own and produced an album with 2 good songs out of 22.His lyrics are awful! They are uninteligent and childish.He slaggs Nas? Fat Joe, Ja Rule i can understand but Nas took him on tour when he was a nobody, so 50 repays him by slagging him AND his wife??I dont know, i just thought it would be better"
4,"On par, if not better, than ""Get Rich'""","Lets not kid ourselves here; there aren't many good mainstream rap albums being released these days. So in retrospect, ""The Massacre"" is quite a good rap album. Yeah the lyrics illustrate the usual death, murder, girls and money but it's done really well -- it's entertaining. If you bought this album expecting introspective and deep lyrics, than your on the wrong end of stick. For everybody else, this is a nice piece of entertainment.4/5"
1,50 Cent: The Massacre,"If you want to listen to some real 50 Cent go buy Get Rich or Die Tryin'. This album his pure garbage. I can't believe I just wasted my $15 on this horrible album. In Da Club was a better single than Disco Inferno and Candy Shop put together. 50 Cent has no flow and the choruses suck. Eminem yet again destroys 50 on his own track, if I was 50 I'd be embarrassed. He hyped up his album just to sell records, don't buy into it. Don't waste your money on this album unless you are a die hard 50 fan or you won't like it."
3,What happened?,"First off, I don't pay attension to the politics and beefs of rappers, but this CD is not at all good. His Get Rich or Die Tryin' record was what I would call a ""classic"" rap album while The Massacre just a flop. His lyrics are choppy, the beat aren't great (even with Dr. Dre's help), Eminem's proformance sucked on ""Gatman and Robbin"", and the rest of G-Unit didn't do much. The few good ones are; This Is 50, Outta Control (not the REMIX with Mobb Deep who suck), Gunz Come Out, and the Hate It Or Love It REMIX. My advice, just download these songs from somewhere, $16.00 is not worth it!"
1,garbage,"ok, when rapper is hard, stay the **** hard, stop getting soft, a lot of this stuff happenz to rappers i love , like dr. dre,( still like him, but not as much) nas, Eminem, didnt stay true to his style, and this list should include few more rappers, i just can get em of the top of my head, i have no problem with half dollar making records dissin people , making a lot of money with much less talent, w.e, but if on one record u diss someone , dont make a love song the next one, stay hard and gangsta man, wtf is this week ****, be G and be hood, i know for people like two quaters it's all about money, but atlest try to make half desent tracks, stay dark and project like, like mobb deep and wu-tang"
1,unexpected,totally not expected... well i had high hopes but he gets a one on this one .... it should definatly be shady over fifty and shady would def not be robin ... this was one of the biggest turnarounds going from get rich or die tryin to this bull****
1,STRAIT GARBAGE,I WISH I COULD PLACE A -5 STARS BECAUSE THIS CD IS STRAIT GARBAGE. ID RATHER LISTEN TO KELLY CLARKSON INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!!! ITS A GOOD THING THE GAME IS OUT OF THE GAY-UNIT HE'S BETTER OFF GOING SOLO.
1,Awful,"U want Candy Shop? I AM the Candy shop! This album sucks. I mean, I know rap is horrible anyway, but does 50 cent really have to add another horrible album to his collection?? You want REAL music, get yerself some Alice In Chains."
1,im very dissapointed,"50 is/was my fav rapper, now hes acting like a lil baby. He kicked the game out of G-unit just cuz he doesnt want to be involved in 50s beefs...which is just about every single person in rap. Hes now the cockiest person ive ever heard. This cd is no where near Get rich or die trien. Gatman and robin with eminem is the best song on the whole cd, and even in that song 50 makes it very clear that hes the best and he cant be killed cuz hes the best. He also needs to learn that there is more to life than ice,drugs,guns and hoes that all he talks about and in the rap game these subjects are kind of worn out"
1,"Outa control Re-Mix is tight ,but the rest is wack","50 cent needs to stop trying to be Dr.Phil&Make Music.dude spent a good chunk of the past few years dissing Ja Rule&look at whose Blue-Print he is Following?? 50 cent is a Marginal Rapper with tired Beats on this Disc.throwing in Videos to alot of tired songs ain't ease the wackness of the disc.""Outta Control"" is tight but after that forget about it."
3,too much garbage,"I've listened to this album a few times, but its way too long and more importantly has too many garbage tracks. If 50 decided to reduce the number of tracks this album would be pretty hot, but instead I find my self switching thru all the crap to find the few good tracks. Please playas."
1,What Does Garbage sound like?,"Just listen to this, this is garbage!!! don't waste your money on it! download the damn thing off the internet if your curious to find out how bad this actually is! Man I put it in my cd player, I got through 2 songs with excrutiating pain, rolled down the window and tossed it! Lyrics are worse than Camron! Sounds like he made the whole album high and drunk out his mind, cuz if he thinks this will massacre anything, then he must be CRAZY!!!! If there was a zero stars option, this would definately get it. Giving this album away for free should be illegal!"
1,look at this dude.,"it's like he's saying ""buy my cd or i'll blow your fgdfging head off.he gets his fame only off of his image and contact with eminem. and his image says 'im cool cuz i survived the streets'. well he was a drug dealer and gangster, he'd be cooler if he found a smarter way of surviving."
1,"He really is a killa, he even killed rap!!!","This album really was properly titled the massacre. That pretty much summed up the experience. The more I hear this idiot stumble over his words like a 90 year old stroke victim, the more I wana vomit. I can't believe this [...] is selling. I would like to thank todays youth for allowing ""music"" like this to stick around. It shows how true music is losing its grasp in today's society. This is why I don't listen to any rap made after the mid 90's."
1,Cookie cutter rap....,"Just read the title. Ok when he first came out with ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" I admit I kinda liked a few of the songs. Not that they had any real meaning. The lyrics weren't anything we haven't heard before, but it was catchy. You know kinda like a jingle from a commercial. Now it's going way too far! Every freakin song I hear on the radio is 50 cent. All the beats sound the same with all the same lame hooks. Normally I will forgive a song poor beats as long as it has good lyrical content, but there is absolutely NOTHING salvageable about this album or his cookie cutter G~Unot lackys. Sorry to say but 50 and guys like him are what is wrong with rap today."
1,stupid,y do ppl like 50 cent he sucks so does rap and the massacre is stupid they call him 50 cent because thats all hes worth dont buy this BS
1,This deserves zero stars,"I don't blame him...I blame his fans. I have to give it to Em and Dr Dre to get a guy like this as big as he is. Pure marketing genius. If a thousand people say something stupid, its still stupid. If 50 says something retarded, we all love it. Go 50! Keep raping the masses with your baby lyrics. ""I blame the fans for being dumb enough to feel ya."""
1,50 cent is NOT 2pac!,STOP believin the shadyaftermath HYPE NO 50 trax dont sounds like pac at all-PAC made POSSITIVE HARDCORE REALALITY RAP - 50 talks about movin BRICKS & buying WHIPS as if all his success came from thatlifestyle-All Im saying is that Pac was a ARTIST a REVOLUTIONARY - 50 cents a ENTERTANTER - I dont hate on snoop dogg that new track w pharrell is FIRE - but snoop is NO PAC and niether is 50. AS FOR REVOLUTIONARY HIPHOP ARTISTISTS THAT ARE STILL MAKING RECORDS CHECK OUT THE NEW CD REVOLUTIONARY VOL TWO by my man IMMORTAL TECHNIQUE NOW THERE IS SOMEONE WITH SOMETHING TO SAY - PEACE
1,Complete B.S.,I've never heard such sugary beats and weak lyrics ever. i would give this album 0 stars if i could. if you want to hear true hip hop check atmosphere or murs. peace
2,Extremely Dissapointing!,"The only real redeeming feature of this otherwise desperately appalling album is 'GET IN MY CAR'. Ponder on this for a while, 50 Cent took issue with The Game because he was getting left on the side while Dr. Dre was churning out 'The Documentary' (a much better album and a fine first commercial release). 'The Massacre' is crap pure and simple, you only have to listen to 'Piggy Bank' to analyse how badly 50 cent misses Dr. Dre's magic touch and when Dre dos contribute the lyrics do not reward the fantastic production in fact I found my self ignoring the lyrics completeley and just settling in to the beat (listen to 'Gunz Come Out'). Scott Storch also puts a dent in the monument of dissapointment that 50 has constructed with 'Candy Shop' and 'Just A Lil Bit' but unfortunately it is not enough to enable me to let this album cling to 3 stars. Okay at best."
2,Not worth your money,"I hate Fat Joe, i hate Nas, but when 50 just starts dissing people it's like he's got no talent. Get Rich or Die Tryin was exceptional, but now that 50 knows he's got a crowd he's releasing this crap.Worst song- Piggybank- completly ripped off from Ja Rule. All 50 does is diss Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Nas and Ja Rule. I dont buy a CD to listen to disses. 0/5Best- Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix)- The Game's version is better. The lyrics are good. 4.5/5"
1,It's a shame.,"You know, at one time, Dr. Dre was scouting amazing talent like The D.O.C.Now he's scouting 'talent' like The Game and 50 Cent.I didn't think it was possible, but Dre is senile at the age of fourty; hell, what am I talking about? He must've been senile to sign Eminem seven odd years ago."
1,get any led zeppelin album instead,"it is surprising that this piece of crap even sold one copy.this album is a non stop joke and this guy is one of the worst rappers i heard after jay z,flusher and game over.dont think of buying even copy regrettably i cant give this trash less than one star.get led zeppelin's fourth album instead."
1,Bootleg or download this crap but don't buy it!,"When you go into that record store you go to, and you see the new 50 Cent album, walk right past it. It's wack!"
3,A lot of good songs but not as good as Get Rich or Dye Trying...,"The Massacre is a long album with a lot of weak tracks which bring it down, but the beats are really good for the most part and if you enjoy some of 50s other work there are a lot of songs worth listening to.A lot of people hate 50 Cent for the Piggy Bank song but personally I find it funny the way he knows he will sell more records if he disses loads of people and then goes on to shout ""more money more money"". Most people probably don't see this track the same as I do but I like it.I recomend downloading this album and deleting the weaker tracks because some of it is quite good.Top 5 songs:1. My Toy Soldier feat. Tony Yayo2. I Don't Need Em3. Piggy Bank4. Ski Mask Way5. In My Hood"
2,Great Marketing but Still a Poor Product,"I can say I am definitely not a 50 Cent fan, and this CD does very little to change my opinion of his musical talent. I will admit he has great beats on the CD, but still his rapping skills definitely leave some to be desired. I would highly suggest artists such as Jim Jones, Young Buck, and Tru as better new CDs in the gangsta rap genre. Save your money and listen to a friends copy of this CD before buying it, due to some might really like it but i personally feel I could have spent the money on a better CD."
2,Not saying anything,"It is a sad fact but although 50 is definately a better rapper than The Game his album isn't in the league of Game's. Nor is it close to his first album. Although there is some clever rhymes and flow on some tracks overall it is a mediocre album. Other than the singles we already know tracks worth hearing are Ski Mask Way, Piggybank, Ryder Music and Supposed to die Tonight. Only buy if you are a big 50 fan otherwise you can find something better to spend your Money on."
1,"Straight out the hood, then turned Hollywood...","I just can't seem to understand what happens to rappers as they move along in their careers. How can you have such grit and intensity on one album, and then turn into an R & B act on the next? I am extremely disappointed with this 50 Cent album. ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"" was an absolute classic, front to back. And 50's releases prior to ""Get Rich..."" were strong lyrically, even if some of the production was weak. But ""The Massacre"" is just straight garbage! Now I know why I've always gone back to listening to underground and local hip-hop... the artists still care about the music. First 50 Cent dates Vivica, now he's trying to BE like Vivica... Hollywood! I hope his soul is worth all the cash... because the respect that he's lost with the TRUE fans of rap music can never be replaced. Please America, don't waste your cash on ""The Massacre."""
1,*sighs*,"Go listen to Bone thugz 'n Harmony or N.W.A thats TRUE rap, the way it was supposed to be done and hear, or buy this and be remain a pouser, your choice."
2,pretty whack I expected better,"this cd wasn`t good it only had a couple of good songs but bad production,dre only produced 3 songs.the only good songs are in my hood, and i`m supposed to dye tonight.He also tryied too hard to diss nas i dont care about ja , jada or fat joe but he is not on nas` level what was he thinking. NOT SMARTDON`T BUY THIS CD BUY THE DOCUMENTARY BETTER OR STRAIGHT OUTTA CA$HVILLE"
1,I COULDN'T WAIT TO RATE THIS SH*T,"Anyone fool who didn't learn from Gay-Z about tryin' to diss KING NASIR should automatically get 0 stars from attempting that garbage ""swinebank"". Joey Crack and the Kiss of Death are going to have fun running this wanksta into the mud. Nas, relax they got you. ILL WILL,TS and D-BLOCK!(it's murda)"
1,WHEN GOOD RAPPERS GO BAD!!!!,"Hmmmmmm another rapper falls victum to fame. No longer real, realeasing rubbish such as 'candy shop' and selling albums just so people can hear ' piggy bank' a primative diss. If anyone now bothered to respond 50 cent would be verbally raped, with Nas and Jay Z spittin such good disses 50 looks like a small child.For a real diss try clickety clank - Sheek Louch (of D Block)50 cent is only big becuase of his 'friends', dre and eminem, they have manufactured G-Unit into a band bringing in The Game and olivia. From this album we can see how 'manufactured' 50 cent is, with corny and cheap tracks.You either hate it or love it......u either hate it becuase you have comman sense or you love it becuase you are up 50 cents arse(ass 4 u americans)."
3,Not event close to GRODT!,"5o inherited the beef wit Ja Rule sayin that he makes to many love songs. GRODT was a good album becuz unlike his rival, he made songs just for gangstas and real n*ggaz. Only one song was a love song(21 Questions)! The Massacre has only 5 or 6 good hood songs. Rest are wack.Just to name some of the wack songs:Piggybank (If he really wanted to start somthin' then he should've added more disses)Candy shop (regardless of radio play, this song simply sucks)God Gave me Style (a try by 50 to make songs like DMX).....and alot more!Some songs that were good are:I'm suppose to die tonight (Pretty good song, straight up gangsta song)In my hood (shout out to his hood).....and couple more!if u really wanna BUY it, buy a bootleg. I wouldn't waste 15 bucks for this."
1,Why?.........,"am I even wasting my time writing a review for this trash. Does he know anything else than guns, dissing Vivica (which makes no cents, ooops sense). Time for him to put the mic down, go to school and get his diploma first! I am soooo disappointed in this cd, i'm not even going to sell it to someone else to listen to it. As a matter of fact,......., did you here the crack, that actually was the actual cd. No, I really broke it!"
2,What happen 50???,"All that sh*t talking and nothing to back it up. I thought for sure all the hype about this albumn that this was going to be another classic. WRONG. ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" was it. 50, in my opinion rushed this one. he helped put out The Games cd at the same time he was trying to do his thing and his own CD flopped. This CD could have been 10X's better than what it is. This sounds more like mix tape material, not his real stuff. 50, I'm disappointed!!!! what a dissapointment to everyone!!!!"
3,masacre,i honestly think this album could of been better than that i'm a little disapointed in 50 but it's different from get rich and die tryin thts the best album from 50 besides his mixtapes theres only like 5 good songs out of 22 thats knd of bad cayse the g unit cd was gangsta good but masacare not so good cause on some tracks hes singing on the games album is hell of a lot better.
3,"good rapping, nothing new since Get Rich or Die Trying.","The Massacre is in the same vein that 50 Cent made with his mainstream debut, Get Rich or Die Trying. the appealing gangsta swagger, drug hustling, gang, and clubbing lyrics. That's just its problem - The Massacre brings nothing new to the table that 50 had before, just a lot more. There are 21 tracks of straight rapping, no skits breaking it up, just straight Hennessey, coke and bitches. Same old, same old, it gets boring. He can rap for sure, his rhymes are better than ever. Still, why listen to this when I can listen to Get Rich and Die Trying. There are some good tracks that I like, such as ""Piggy Bank"" with an almost monumental chorus, the speeding Gatman and Robbin', and of course A Baltimore Love Thing. Still, not as enjoyable or new as Get Rich was."
1,What is this,"Is this rap or britney spears bootlegs? Do not buy this album it is not worth it. I seen 50 cent in new york and i almost had to shoot him with my glock but the po po were around him cause he scared of fat joe,jadakiss,nas and that song piggy bank was the weakest diss i have ever heard in this industries and fat joes foo foo was way better and funnier."
3,Sophmore slump...,"Im feelin the same way most of the listeners of ""The Massacre"" are feelin, it just is not livin up to the hype. I hate it how they pushed the album back and changed its name from ""The Valentines Day Massacre"", I thought that was a creative title. The CD is a big mix of tiresome songs, average songs, and bangers. Its TOO DAMN LONG also, there are 21 songs.My Fav Tracks:Piggy BankGatman and RobbinOutta ControlGunz Come OutMy Toy SoldierPosition of PowerGod Gave Me Style"
1,Junk Music,My cousin bought me this abum for my b-day. I listen to this once and gave it away to a friend. It was awful a bumch of stupid mindless songs. I think its funny how 50 Cent manages to make money of this garbage. I give him props for that.
1,what a boring moment,"never heard something this dull before, save u'r money, right now 50's just want to be on everybody (...)"
2,Nothing New,"Two years after the huge success of his major label debut, 50 Cent releases his new album. The production is great, but all of the songs sound very similar. The lyrical content is not the best ever either. The album mainly focuses on the things that ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"" focused on: shootings, rap rivalries, and getting a woman to shake that almighty ass. I understand that the level of quality in not only the new rap music, but in all music in general is at an all time low, so I wasn't expecting this album to be very ground breaking. Given that fact, this album is definitely not one of the best ever made, but it is way better than most of the garbage heard on pop and rap radio lately. Hopefully rap music will climb out of its dark hole and become diverse and creative again someday soon. Until then, go listen to some Public Enemy, Run DMC, Tupac, Beastie Boys, or any classic rap if you want to be exposed to quality rap music."
1,WARNING: do not buy this album!,"I did not like the last album and I definitely don't like this one.I cannot see how a loser like 50 cent has become such a phenomenon.Every person I know regrets ever paying for this album.Please do yourself a favor, and don't spend even 50 cents on this crap!"
2,Forget it!!!,"Screw buying this album. Just download Outta Control (remix) for 99 cents and don't even bother geting this album. If you want 50 cent buy his first CD "" Get Rich or Die Trying""."
2,Truthfully,"I am not giving this two stars, just because everyone says 50 sucks. I'm not going with the corwd, just telling the truth.Obviously, 50 has great producers, but he's not a great rapper. For instance, So Amazing. Nice beat, bad rapping.Know what I mean?"
1,"0 stars, a disgrace to rap",no wonder so many people say rap sucks. 50 makes people think all rap is like his. No wonder he got shot at 9 times people didnt want to listen to his crap on the radio.
1,My review for the album....,"50 is just like totally like soooo totally wack, yo! Like, 50, like totally just like is so mad wack, word is like bond!"
1,corporate hip hop,"G-Unot has become the new saying in the hip hop community, and snitching on fellow artists is the new bling bling, 50 has embodied everything that is not true hip hop is not. 50 has based his career on ""beef"" with lesser artists i.e. Ja Rule and murder inc. but when a more talented artist claps back like Shyne or Game 50 cannot fire back, and if he does it becomes a laughable track in which he says ""G-Unit"" 10 or more times. Like the reviewer above stated if you want some good NY hip hop get the new Ghostface Killah, or even get some Smif ""N"" Wessun, dont fall for this Corporate hip hop created for suburban white kids."
4,g unit,pretty good cd even though its old50 cent never gets oldfavorite songs areCandy ShopJust A Lil Bit
1,"BORING, LAME, AND OUT OF CONTROL","YOU KNOW WE ALL SAY WHY ARE TEENAGERS THE WAY THEY ARE.... WELL THIS CD IS A PRIME EXAMPLE. IT TALKS ABOUT GUNS, DRUGS, MURDER, SEX, EVERYTHING I WOULD KEEP MY KID AWAY FROM. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A LAW AGAINST SAYING WHAT YOU WANT IN MUSIC. IT JUST GETS OUT OF CONTROL."
4,OKAY,"Most of the people who reviewed this cd were children. So, you can say only little girls and boys feel this music right? No. Even though I'm not a die hard fan of 50 cent nor am I one who chaints "" G-UNOT"" or flaunt my g-unot shirt wherever I go. I still think this CD was great.It wasn't better than Get Rich or Die trying ( Kind of stupid making a movie after a cd) But, it was a decent sophmore album. There's a lot of songs on there that you wouldn't waste any money on but, theres some that are pretty cool. No Doubt you should go get the Game album if you haven't got it yet! But, this cd is better than what others are saying it is."
3,Marketing Gone Awry,".50 cent is not so much a musician as a marketing gimmic. the content on this album has been heard a million times before. to rap about violence and misogyny has lost all shock value. Now it's the safe route, and for some reason it works. the never ending conveyer belt of crap coming out of rap today will never stop until people stop supporting it. why do i give it 3 stars? the guy may be taking the safe route, but he does it relatively well."
1,2Pac he is not.,"As much as 50 cent (or eminem) try to act, live, and rap like Pac, they cannot come close. 2Pac actually rapped about the issues, and had some deep and inspirational songs aside from angry diss tracks. 50 Cent is just an unrepentant ex-drug dealer who got rich off morons who gave him their $. He has no depth, no soul, and if he said ""can you feel me?"" - no, no one can.Avoid at all costs. Grade: F-"
1,BLAH HUMBUG,"If you dare to purchase this album, beware of the consequences because hell will await you. As a reference let's say that the 'devil' is Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent. Being bad as (not bad-ass), and make music for the money and not for the music, the 'devil' will get you by screwing over your wisdom and IQ making it less than 20, you'll never escape the wrath of 50 Cent; ever! So, be with Jesus Christ and he shall bless you at all times. Pray to him and ensure you're not messing with the 'devil' or being posessed by the 'devil'."
1,Poor,"It strikes me as odd that the weakest artists seem to get the most attention.Take J-Lo, for example. You have to admit that J-Lo does not have vocal talent, or songwriting abilities (that's why she doesn't write her own songs). Yet she is achieving big success with her second rate singles and albums.Now take 50 Cent. While I do enjoy some rap artists, (Outkast and some Eminem come to mind while typing) I feel that when you are rapping, you should have a style of speaking, not just mumbling, what 50 Cent does in all of his songs.The lyrics are also very weak. Disagree with me? Look up The Beatles, Coldplay, Kate Bush, anybody with talent - look up the lyrics, and compare them to 50 Cent's (obviously there's bad language). See the difference?Rap can succeed with excellent beats. However, 50 Cent's beats are rather dull and unexciting, playing over and over again.As a whole, this is a very poor album which was not enjoyable to listen to.0/10 - Terrible"
1,Unbelievably Horrid,"This -- first of all -- is not music. Most rap has absolutely no musical value. Second, this filth is playing in the ears of kids everywhere! Lets review some lyrics, shall we? ""I'll let you lick the lollypop, go 'head girl, don't you stop, keep going 'til you hit the spot."" What the hell is that?? You don't suppose there is some second sexual meaning there, do you? Maybe some of the AIDS and rape problems in our society can be traced back to moron ""artists"" like this one who include lyrics like this in their albums. I really don't have anything personally against rap. It's just that I have never heard of a rap song (that I can recall), that actually had meaning. They all sing about violence or sex. So go ahead and listen to 50 Cent if you want some guy with no brains and no musical talent to sing to you about how his sex was last night. It's your loss!"
2,"Wow, what a letdown","How can people give this 5 stars. Whoever gives this 5 stars has the lamest taste in music, no joke. Just listen to the boring production. Production is half the battle in rap/hip-hop because it has to make up for the fact that rappers usually don't SING A MELODY. The instrumentals are all horrible, with the exception of the excellent standout track, 'Outta Control'. The only time I listen to this album is to hear 'Outta Control'. It's hot.As for 50's lyrical ability.......It's certainly not as good as it was on his debut album. Yes, he took 9 bullets and he deserves to brag all he wants. But that doesn't make him an excellent rapper. Why can't people distinguish good music from bad music? If you want to hear EXCELLENT production with good meaningful lyrics, listen to Kanye West or Outkast. However, if you are satisfied with this dull crap, keep buying into it. It's your decision."
3,It aint wack or great.,"The album is a little to poppy for me but at the same time it has some good tracks. This album has above average production and less than average lyrics and solid hooks. It isnt as bad as the umderground, hate every thing popular, 50 haters think it is. It isn't as good as the teeny bopping, can't spell rap, GGGG-Unit members think it is. It is actually close to a 4 star cd until Candy Stick or Magic Shop whatever its called. Besides that and Disco ""On Fire"" Inferno the album is pretty nice."
1,0 stars should be,This album sucks it is not worth the price they have on here. It should cost 50 cents just like his name. He is jealous of the game that is y he kicked him out of the gay unit which i am glad cause the game is better then that whole camp. 50 cent should never rap again after this album cause he is fake and a little bitch
2,Don't know what to say...,"I bought this album back in March, and for the first couple of days, I loved it. Then, after hearing about him removing The Game from his label, plus learning more about his songs, I started to dislike the album. But since then, I still don't know what to say about it. There is only a handful of songs I like on the album, which are ""GatMan & Robbin,"" ""GunZ Come Out,"" ""Hate it or Love it,"" and ""Piggy Bank."" The rest I feel were just filler. Also, 50 Cent thinks way too much of himself, thinking he is this big #1 rapper, and trying to start something with all these other rappers... it's just stupid. So, I guess I now know what to say about this album, ""Bootleg it."""
1,Best album ever made,yeah best album ever made if you like bad music. money goin' down the drain with this one.....
5,The Best of Runt,"A great compilation from Castle Records. Wonderful packaging, too! I think the song selection is even better than the Rhino Anthology. Don't miss it. A great collection for Todd fans and new comers, alike. Love it!"
3,...,"shipping was like any item like within a week which was good. however, when i use them in dance class, i slip and fall with them because the bottom of it won't ""grip"" as other hip-hop shoes. YOU MUST ORDER AT LEAST A SIZE BIGGER!! when i bought it, it didn't say u had to order at least a half size so i bought my regular size and i was like ""next time i must order a full size bigger"". now i can't use it."
4,Just OK.,"Feels like more of a History book than a Soccer book. If you're looking for the X's and O's of Van Gaal's system and an in-depth analysis of past Barca greats, this isn't it. The writer is exceptional at analyzing the sociocultural makeup of the club, however. I found it interesting to an extent, however it wasn't what I was after."
4,Excellent bargain,"I agree with the positive comments of all the reviewers below. A couple of points that that might interest prospective purchasers:1. Most of the repeats, but not all, are observed.2. Although I agree that the level of playing and interpretation is VERY high, I found Frank's mannerism of anticipating the right hand with the left occurred often enough to be annoying.That said, this set will give a great deal of pleasure, but I agree that I wouldn't want it to be the only one in my collection."
5,A Musician Plays Beethoven,"For years, my touchstone recording of the 32 Beethoven Piano Sonatas has been the Arthur Schnabel 1930s version. I had always wanted sound on a par with the musicianship. However, Fleisher, my favorite ""modern"" Beethoven performer, although he has given us amazing performances of the piano concerti, never got to these before he was stricken.Have no fear. This is it! Frank's performance is wonderous. The desciple's musicianship is on a par with his mentor, and the sound lets me hear even more. It is even better than I hoped."
5,Easy Steps to Better Living,"I really like the idea that small changes can add up to make a difference in your health. After reading the author's tips for improving your eating, I added fresh green peppers and onion into our jar of spaghetti sauce to get more veggies in our diet. A little thing, but easy to make the change.The author suggests mixing ground turkey breast in some recipes to cut down on fat (for instance 1/2 ground turkey & 1/2 extra lean ground beef for chili). ""No one knows the difference,"" she explains."
5,JLS,Great book! This first time writer has a great storyline. Once I started reading I could'nt put this book down. I love the way the family secret unfolds. In the end the children truly ruled.
5,Leslie Rocks!,"If you like bands such as Mountain, The Animals or The Rolling Stones, you'll probably like this Album. Of course Leslie West was one of the founders of Mountain. Mick Jagger actually plays on this album which features a nice cover of Honky Tonk Woman and House of the Rising Sun.I owned the Great Fatsby in college and was thrilled to find it available on CD. Try it, you'll like it."
1,Not worth your time and money!,"The charm is a huge disappointment. It looks like it is from a gumball machine. And even worse, the clasp does NOT even connect so that you can put a chain on it. It is really chinsy!! I hope the refund is as simple as the purchase!"
1,Tsk tsk,"Sadly, after repeated examination, it indeed appears that the soon-to-be 36-year-old Pratt indeed splices his recordings--i.e., he takes the best individual moments he can come up with to achieve superficial result. Personally, I prefer ""honest"" classical musicians when I listen to classical, as is generally the standard, though I suppose there may be those who simply want to hear what they want to hear for whatever reason."
1,Mr. McNuggets at best,"Strikes me much as eating Chicken McNuggets for Thanksgiving: anonymous, empty, liquified, semi-sorta-processed, wanna-be meat that one's a bit ashamed of ingesting, yet very amusing regardless that it exists in the first place. F+"
3,Missing tracks,"As usual, London Symphony does a creditable job but I was disappointed in yet another ""complete"" work, which all labels promote and seldom deliver. I especially like the long tromvone solo Berlioz wrote in the second half of this brilliant opera. . . but once again that track does not appear at all. Too many producers fib to us customers. --Jerry D"
4,The Missing Homework,"This is a story about a kid and his name is Bill. He opens his arithmetic book then he finds a funny looking number paper. His best friend Ken helped him look for his homework. Ken had an idea so he told Bill, ""Let's do everything that we did yesterday so we can find your homework."" I like this book because I did not know what was going to happen."
4,Great gift for Cookie Monster fans,"I purchased this Cookie Monster puppet for my girlfriend's birthday. She loves that his hands are essentially gloves... which means you (as the puppeteer) have the finger dexterity to pick up COOKIES and shove them into the mouth of the puppet, which can munch away under the control of your other hand.After testing, we recommend hard sugar cookies for this puppet. They only produce crumbs, but no stains.When not in use, Cookie can be displayed and posed like any other stuffed animal - an added bonus.Personally, I would have paid considerably more money for this toy if his fur was the correct color dark blue, and (most importantly) if he had hard plastic eyes with spinning pupils.As he is, however, The 27"" Cookie Monster Puppet is a well made toy that is a total blast to play with at any age.Ommm nom, nom, nom (oh, delicious) nom, nom (yeah) nom!"
3,It was ripped,The product was ripped 4inches under the neck and i was very disapointed! Said it was NEW. Can't find any more of cookie monster online so i kept it and will never order again! Lucky I know how to sew. Seller does not care.
3,good but a problem,I bought this a week back. so far so good..however i am facing a peculiar problem. the booklet mentions that this can write cd-r at a speed of 16x however when i tried writing with nero 6 (which i have been using since long) it allowed me to write only at 4x. i checked with nero support if this is the problem with nero but the support site mentions that they do support this dvd writer with its full capability. (the model is i think pioneer dvr-k12d or something). i called toshiba and told them this problem and they said they dont support any 3rd party apps. that was so pathetic of them to give such uninformative answer. however rest looks fine so 4 stars.
1,Very unhappy with Toshiba,"Toshiba has the worst customer support system I have ever been involved with. I have had to send my computer into their repair depot 4 times for the same problem (backlight failure). They refuse to replace the computer. The last time the hard drive failed and I lost everything I had stored in the computer. They still tell me ""your only option is to have it repaired"".There are difficulties reaching their helpline. The wait times start at 10 minutes and go up to 30 mins. I've given up on several occasions. Even when you do get to talk to a technician, they are difficult to understand as English is obviously their second language. Several times I was talking to people in India.I would caution everyone reading this to buy a different make of laptop."
2,"Pleased with the product, but","I used the Amazon information to go by, and one thing that I was specifically looking for was a serial port, as many of the applications I run require a serial port connection. I got the device and was very well pleased with it, however, it had no serial port! I like the device well enough to give it to my son, but I am disappointed with the product presentation by Amazon. If you have no need for a serial port, it is a lot of machine in a small package, and I liked it a lot other than the one area. I should have done more research on the device at other sources of info."
4,THE RED HOUSE,This was an old Edward G. Robinson classic.The begining of the tape had bad sound qualitybut improved later.
5,See this with the lights off,"An underrated psychological mood piece directed with great skill by Delmer Daves, it is best watched in the dark with no interruptions so that its full power can be realised. I did not go down in the woods for quite a while after watching this film and gained an added appreciation for the work of Edward G. Robinson and that great actor Judith Anderson (see also Hitchcock's REBECCA). From one of the greatest periods of Hollywood movie making."
3,"Brilliant Offbeat Daves Film, Horrible Print for DVD","As with many of Delmer Daves' films, The Red House shows originality, flair, and an intense weaving of landscape, theme, and character (rare among American directors working in the studios). He consistently achieves moments of great subtlety. In addition, Lon McCallister and Allene Roberts deliver striking performances under Daves' sensitive direction. It's no surprise that Scorcese noted this film in his ""Personal Journey Through American Movies"". Unfortunately, the print of the film used for the DVD is HORRIBLE -- there have to be better prints out there of this film!"
2,"OK film, bad picture quality","This film was supposedly ""digitally restored in high definition"". The person in charge of the ""restoration"" obviously doesn't know the difference. The print is horribly washed out and not particularly sharp. From a picture quality point of view, this is the worst Blu-ray I have ever bought."
3,Early Horror Movie,"This is a movie that is okay. Edward G. is good, but the quality of the movie itself is poor to moderate."
1,No wonder this DVD was Cheap!,The story line was anticlimactic! The characters were unreal.What a letdown! Save your money and skip this turkey! It shoves.
2,Great schlock...not great film,"I must disagree with the other reviewers. This is NOT a great film. It is a great schlocky B movie. Wonderfully bizarre-- yes. Great film making, great acting, scary-- no. Essentially you have a quickly made, low budget thriller here that benefits from Robinson and a teenage Julie London with a massive dose of heavy-handed freudian symbolism. The hero tells his girlfriend that he'll have to ""bust open"" the ""red house"" to get to the bottom of the mystery. Hmmmm. Robinson's character seems to have a sexual interest in his adopted daughter. All that and a big bad wolf character that seems to hang out in the woods all day (and night) looking for stray girls. Lots of fun for those interested in this type of thing. I can imagine the college crowd eating it up over beers."
1,the great edward g robinson in a preposterous dud,This must be Robinson's worst movie ----a great actor in a preposterous plot.The film tries for suspence---and ridiculous and unbelievable things happen --Avoid at all cost--Even the great Judith Anderson has a non part
4,"STRANGE, MOODY THRILLER","Robinson plays a crippled farmer who, after his daughter brings home a suitor, attempts to keep everyone from a mysterious red house located on his property. Madness and murder prevail. Strange film noir about tangled relationships and unsuccessful attempts to bury the horrid past. Even the cast is unusual: Rory Calhoun, Judith Anderson, Ona Munson, Julie London and Lon McCallister!"
2,underwhelmed,"The knife is about what I expected for about $9.50, so no problem there. However, the sheath is non-functional as a ""arm & leg sheath"". I'm no bodybuilder, but the straps are too short to go around my bare calf, let alone my thigh or bicep. So, with shipping, a waste of about $20."
3,Valor Combat Knife - Kill or Be Killed,"Scrutinizing the blade closely, I notice that it appears to employ some sort of laminate technology - it consists of two black (anodized?) outer blades which envelope a thin silver-gray metallic cutting edge. It seems sharp enough, but perhaps most importantly, it's a short, sturdy blade, perfect for thrusting and gouging. I like the ankle sheath; I purchased it, in part, because I felt it would be well suited to defend against shark attacks. (The recommended defense against a shark is to gouge out both eyes, thus leaving it blind, helpless, and disoriented...it will thereafter be unable to hunt, and will slowly die of starvation.)"
3,Good quality scissors,"They are well built but the blades are thicker than some other scissors ive used, which makes it kindof difficult to trim with. There alright for the price."
3,Ft usb 2.0 usb-A (male) to usb-A (female) passive extension cable,"it is a decent cable. it helps me by not having to reach the usb port at the back. it arrived as expected, on time. i would buy again from amazon."
1,Deceptive ad,"Looks like a WHITE cord from the pic, right? What arrived was black. I guess I only have myself to blame. After all, it didn't actually SAY ""white"" in the ad, so foolish me went by the picture. Thanks so much, Amazon.com!"
1,Not compatible,"Before I bought this cabe, I have been read the review, very say it goods, but when I got it and tried it on into my print and my laptop ( windows 7, 64 bit ) soon I plug in, it said ""cannot found the hardware "". At first I thought, I'm going to return, the cost of this cable is $2.93 plus shipping $2.98 = $5.91. If I return it problobly another $3.00, so I throw away. Before you maksure it compatible."
5,Quality and the price is excellent!,"I looked at many of these cables and decided to go with this one. I liked that the female port was enclosed in the plastic, and was not just metal. These are strong and sturdy cables. I am using one for my USB hub and one for my new keyboard. Buy an extra one because you never know when it will come in handy.Don't pay too much at the stores!I would recommend these to anyone!"
3,little slow here on the shipping,"got to give this 3 stars because shipping is slow, but the cord is ok, in time feels like it may break up"
1,"Dull, toneless, colorless sound.","For the folks who plan to use this equipment to play CD's==forget it. Receiver does not have tone control--bass, treble) and as a result of this vital feature, all music is flat, dull, colorless,lifeless. Big mistake on my part for not checking tone control feature before purchasing. Urge all to stay away from theatre-on-a-box if you plan to use and enjoy as a CD player. Strongly recommend you purchase components individually using an A/V receiver. Passing this Sony crap setup to a relative and starting from scratch with A/V receiver, dvd player, and speakers."
2,painfull to use,"Overall the system is nice: it sounds fine for a low end system and the picture quality is fine. But I hate using it as a CD player. It takes forever to switch between disks, about 30 seconds. Loading or ejecting a disk take even longer. There is no way to tell what disks are loaded in the machine, and you cannot change one disk while it is playing another. These seem like minor things, but when you walk in to the room and turn on the stereo to listen to some music they add up to a 5 minute delay before you are actually listening to anything. Bleh. If I had it to do over I would get a system like my older one that just has a big tray instead of the fancy slot loader. I guess the people at Sony put looks ahead of function on this one."
4,Good Product.,I had the DAV-C770 and had numerous problems with it but this model so far is excellent. The bass enhancement feature really adds that extra kick..makes you really feel the movie. It is a major upgrade from the last model where movies sounded thin and bass was embarrasing. I have a fairly large room and turning the volume pass 10 might send my neighbors running. The progressive scan makes the picture look breathtaking when connected to a HDTV. Definitly would recommend if you like the Home Theater in a Box.
1,"Defenition of ""Junk""","Within a year of owning this system we were having disk read errors, getting the common 'standby' message, having intermittant shut down, etc... This thing is SLOW! Slow loading disks, slow playing disks,and ultra slow changing disks. Basically the reciever is a complete piece of overheating junk.The sound however, is good.....when it works.This is the worst product/thing I have EVER purchased in my life. I cannot express enough how much I hate having ever bought this thing, OR warn you enough not to make the same WAAAAAAAY overpriced mistake. FYI, Im using a computer surround sound on my TV now because I finally ripped the reciever outa the wall and smashed it.....and the computer surround is just as good for $125."
2,Disappointing.,"I've owned this Dream System for 3 years, and have had continuous troubles with it. First malfunction was when the unit's disc eject mechanism broke. Second malfunction was when the unit started to experience startup troubles and would repeatedly cycle through its power-on/power-off sequence. The latest malfunction involves an annoying high-pitched whine emitting from the speakers when the unit is playing in Video 1 or Video 2 mode. Unlike other owners who experienced this problem, I am not willing to open the casing and poke around at the unit's innards. I'm just fed up with this system and would discourage any prospective buyer from considering this unit or any future models branded Sony Dream System."
3,Not that impressed,"This book is ok if you have no background working with spirit guides, otherwise choose another book. This is for entry level only."
4,Okay,"Maybe it's because I'm not doing this daily, or because I'm still waiting for the ""big bang."" Either way, I'm still working on it. The book is an easy read, the techniques are simple...just waiting on the results."
3,Good,"This book is great if you want to become a medium.I don't but there was some interestin stuff on Angels,native spirituallty,and fairy stuff thought it was ok.Thanks"
3,Fair,"No worked examples.Some useful information, not something thatcan be put into practice in an HVAC Designengineering environment, well written, seems to beaimed at a developmental organization oraimed at research personnell."
4,the meadowlark sings,this is a smart well thought out inventive even mix of futuristic literature which is surprising. i was plesantly surprised.
5,Captivating Read,Total awesome police work book. Could not put it down. The plot & everything else is very cool! The author holds your attention forever!
2,Book is in poor condition,"This book was listed in good condition, but it is not - the book is yellow with age, writing all over the front cover, dirty all over both front and back cover, and the covers are in dire need of repair - they look ready to fall off."
5,This is a good book,"I used this book in an undergraduate course on classical controls and dynamic modeling. I found it to be extremely helpful and well written. I have used it many times as a reference both in graduate school and at work, and I have referred it more than once to friends or colleagues with questions on linearization, modeling, and control theory. I am very surprised at the negative comments. I did my graduate work in controls, and, believe me, I have seen many textbooks that were difficult to understand. This is not one of them. I highly recommend this book. Happy reading!"
1,Very difficult to follow. Highly advise to find another book,I am a 4.0 engineering major and I found this book to be one of the worst I have come across. I spent more time trying to figure out how the author got from point A to point B in his derivations than I did learning the material. It is not clearly written. Find another book!
3,Sure- He's a good guitarplayer,But he is often copying complete solos from Junior Watson and Rick Holmstrom..And his singing and songwriting is really poor.Great ideas and a fun album though. The stars are for his guitarplaying and his great band and the guestappearence by the great Kim Wilson.Pretty good sound too.
2,Where's the GAME in this game?,"I'm really disappointed how lame this ""game"" is. Granted - I've never heard of this game show (don't watch TV), but I was expecting a bit of gaming to be involved with this game. The repetitive commentary between picking the cases gets annoying. I played it once and, other than letting other members of my family play it for the first time, it probably will remain untouched from then on. Very disappointing that for all the conceptualizing, marketing, research and programing that goes into creating a game from scratch that they wouldn't have put a bit more ""umph"" into the actual game inself. I do not recommend this game to anyone...save your money for something better."
4,good product,My son and I love the television show so I knew we would love the game. I couldn't find it anywhere in town so I ordered it from Amazon. It's a really fun game and my only complaint is that the graphics are a little dissapointing. I felt that there could have been more spent on the graphics. Howie looks a little weird how he's drawn. Other than that I would recommend this game for purchase.
1,NO DEAL!,"I read the review that said the winning case in his version was always 21. In our situation, it is always case 8. In fact, all the cases are the same each time you turn the game on. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. My next step will be to complain to the company...(UPDATE: The distributor acknowledged the problem, apologized, and promised to send my son a different game. That was months ago, and we never received anything)."
2,Boring,"I was really disappointed. The game takes too long to get through each round - I don't have time to listen to Howie chit chat. I also found that after I completed one game and shut off the system, the same cases had the same amounts when I played it again (hint: case 13 has the $1,000,000). That fact in itself is the reason I returned the game. If the bugs are fixed I might consider trying it again."
3,Just like the show...,"This game is exactly like the show, graphics could be better. My complaint about this game is it takes too long to play. I would rather pick a case(s) and see an offer instead of waiting and listening to the banter of Howie. It was fun the first few times you play but after that you want to speed up the game."
1,I would rate it lower than a 1 if I could!,"The only thing that is good about this one is Howie's voice. The rest of the game is slow, visually not even close the graphics of any other game. It is so slow that you think it is stuck moving from one screen to the other. As far as the mini games, only the safe guess is even close to kinda fun. I was so discouraged."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!,"Do NOT buy this version of Deal Or No Deal for the Nintendo DS! Due to a programming glitch, the million dollars is ALWAYS in the same case. Apparently the case is not the same in EVERY copy, but if you buy this version of the game then once you find the million dollars you will always know where it is. Other reviewers have noted this problem.There is another version of DOND for DS, called ""Deal Or No Deal: Special Edition."" That version does NOT have this problem."
3,Boring game,"The game is kind of boring, too much talking in between rounds. Graphics are horrible. Even my daughter, who is freak about the show, only playeded the game once since we got it."
1,Always the same case,The million is always in the same case each time you turn on the game. Takes too long to get through a game (too many cute comments by Howie - repeated over and over).
1,Never different,"I got this game and thought it was going to be fun - the problem is, the cases never change from game to game. I picked the million dollar case on my first game. Turns out, every time I play it, the same number case is the million dollar case...and all the others have the same dollar amount as well. What a waste of money! Might have been fun if the dollar amounts would have switched cases every game."
3,its ok,the game is just about like the tv show and its ok to play after the first two times playing it you get borad with it.
3,Deal or no Deal....seems to be predictable,"I ordered this game for my 7 year old son. He loves the TV show. Unfortunately, he discovered very quickly that case #6 seems to always hold the $1M prize. My husband and I have also played the game over and over and only once or twice did another case hold the prized money. Has anyone else had this experience as well? It certainly takes the fun out of it if you know which case holds the one million dollars each time."
2,No deal,This game becomes boring after a few plays. The graphics are HO HUM. I expected a lot more so Howie NO DEAL!
4,not bad !,"there was no problem with my game.. i'm sure the $million changes on every game.....i tried the numbers that people were experiencing...and it was never the same. i guess the glitch has been fixed.. its not bad! a nice game to ease the time away....i enjoy playing it.. it does get a bit slow..then i press the ""a"" button & it passes by so i'm happy so far"
1,"Unless you're an idiot, don't buy this.","Not only is the presentation tedious and awful, but the game is broken: first game you play when you fire up the cartridge, every single time, pick case #21. You'll always have the million dollars. In other words, these morons couldn't even write a routine to randomize a one-dimensional array.There's no way this should have been anything but a $20 budget title if it WORKED, but seeing as these people couldn't even be bothered to program the game, you would be a fool to buy this."
4,likes it,My son plays this game when he wants a change from his other games. He would recommend it to others..
3,IT needs work,"THe game itself is alot of fun, but it has the same cases every time! the 1,000,000 dolar case is case 8 for me. if the cases were different every time, It would be a whole lot better. DONt buy this game."
4,A little slow,"This game is identical to the tv game,however I found it to be a bit on the slow side,allowing howie too much talk time"
5,Great service,Got the DVD for my 5 year old Granddaughter because she loved mine. She loves it and knows all the words to his songs & the order they are in.Fast shipping. Thanks!
5,murchunga happiness,"I received my Murchunga within three days of placing my order.For such a small mouth harp, it has a powerful sound which farexceeds the commercial mouth harp I bought 2 years ago.I am thouroughly pleased and would not hesitate to order another."
4,A fun book to relive the memories with,"As a die-hard Gator and SEC fan (toughest conference in the nation mind you) I recommend this book. I made it a member of my collection with pride! Hey check out ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" it is a kick-ass book for SEC freaks like me!"
1,"If you like blurry pictures and typos, this one's for you!","Could have been a real fun gift for Gator fans...but so little care has gone into this, it's a shame. Many other books out there that live up to their titles. Take a pass."
4,Good training for SQL DB design,"This is a fun and engaging way to learn SQL Server 7, but if you're taking the MS exam, I would definitely recommend following up with a more detail-oriented book and a practice test. If you're new to databases, read a general database-design book (such as Database Design for Mere Mortals by Hernandez) before using this training kit. Hands-on practice with SQL 7 is necessary as well.The simulations on the CD are a great concept, but some are too easy. In many exercises, you are loading pre-written scripts. This is convenient; but in order to become truly familiarized with the syntax, you need lots of practice actually typing out the code."
4,"Good overview, but still lacking essential material","For those who just want to achieve MCDBA and if only score is relevant to you, here is my score 897/1000 for (70-029) and 920/1000 for (70-028).Look at my review on SQL Server 7.0 System Administration Online Training Kit (70-028). I hold the same opinion for this (70-029) training kit.Yes, there are still mistakes, and not enough coverage of the subject material. I can never stress enough; you still need to have the 'Inside MS SQL Server 7.0', 'Books Online' (comes with the 120 days evaluation SQL Server 7.0 software with this kit) and actual code implementation experience. You need more time to prepare and expose yourself to this particular course. Time is the essence. This examination can be a long one, more difficult than others, but nothing is difficult if you have the determination to succeed."
2,Poor book for the exam (70-029),"I wrote the exam, using this book as a primary guide, and failed.The exam was a shock, used language I had never heard of before (e.g. 'surrogate primary keys'), and the questions were of a practical, 'exercise' nature.Without use of practice tests, this book is dismally insufficient.Make sure you know what 'OLTP' and 'DECISION-SUPPORT' mean. Perhaps I'm an ignoramus, but I don't remember these terms being highlighted in the book.jp"
3,Good book for an overview.,Good book for an overview but I found it lacking when taking the 70-029 test.
1,Never arrived,"I never received this item. The seller claimed to have shipped it and charged my credit card. But a few days later I received notice that the item was unavailable. The money was refunded to my credit card, but the incident make it clear that the claim to charge your card only when the item is shipped is not always faithfully observed."
1,A Real Somewhat Sly Hatchet Job,"I did read the whole book just so I could comment on it. The part about him being docile when visiting his parents home made me throw up. But I persevered and read the rest of it. I just don't understand why the President and Nancy let this book happen. If you hate Reagan and you hate Conservatives, then this book should make you very happy. I threw my copy away. No way was I going to give this to the library like I usually do."
3,I probably could have liked this more.,"Being a huge fan of both Heavenly and Marine Research, I was prepared to love this album, but there's something about it that puts me off. I think the instrumentation levels are way too loud, causing them compete with Amelia's vocals. I wish someone could re-work this and release it again, because it's got hints of beauty."
3,"Not my favorite Hilton novel, but good","This is a fine novel, but one of my least favorite of Hilton's books (my favorite is Random Harvest). I did not find some sections of So Well Remembered engaging, and it wasn't until half way through the book that I really cared how the story would end. And the end was very ambiguous, he could easily have continued the book for a few more chapters.Despite all that, I still found it a worth-while read. His characters, as usual, were great and that is why Hilton is one of my favorite authors. Just don't make this the first Hilton novel you read."
2,Too Narrow,"The case was way too narrow for a single stack Sig 40SW mag. I made it work after a trip to Ace Hardware, a few longer screws and some nylon spacers--a little funky but it works now. Very durable construction, holds well on a good belt."
4,Classic Pia,"Pia sings classic standards with the London Philarmonic Orchestra and she does it well. Otherwise they would not play with her. She sings ""Maybe this time"", ""Embraceable you"" and others. Absolutely convincing. Her follow up ""I am what I am"" is even better."
4,stop the negativity.,I saw Pia Zadora many years ago and was floored by the powerful voice and presentation comming out of this petite young woman. She has taken a lot of criticism for her acting ability but anyone that could be an opening act for a Sinatra show had to show some talent. She does an excellent job on tis tape.
4,Haven't compared this to many other recordings,"but I think this is very well-done. It's beautiful music, well-performed and well-recorded. Lots of energy and life. Great couplings as well. I'm not disappointed in the slightest and have no desire to seek to ""upgrade."""
5,A Great Variety of Chrismas Music with a good mix of artists,"I have to admit I was skeptical when ordering this CD but when it arrived, I was glad I did. It is a wonderful mix of artists with their own rendition of classic Christmas songs. My personal favorite is ""White Christmas"" with Elton John and the cutest is ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" with Elmo. Great buy."
4,Fun and Happy Listening!,Great to have light-hearted Christmas music in such a happy rhythm all the way. Rosie actually is outstanding for an amateur. Best Christmas CD we've picked up for a long time.
3,CHRISTMAS FUN!,"O.K. so Rosie isn't a singer and she has never claimed to be but with a help of a few of her musical friends which include Cher,Donny Osmond,Celine Dion,'NSYNC,and a few others,she has made this album which I call ""Christmas Fun!"".There's something for everyone here on this album which includes fairly new stuff from Cher to a standard classic with the all time great, Rosemary Clooney...Rosie's voice isn't that bad and a matter of fact,she's good. Like I said,it's a fun Christmas album for all to enjoy...You shouldn't be disappointed,but if you are just remember all proceeds go to the FOR ALL KIDS FONDATION..."
5,A really great Christmas album,I find that I can't stop listening to this cd. It puts me into such a Holiday mood. I love that Rosie paired herself with so many great stars of music. I found that Rosie's singing just added a nice touch to the songs and she didn't overpower. I can't wait until next year to see if she does another. The duet with Trisha Yearwood is one of the best.
5,The BEST I've EVER heard,"This is the best christmas CD i've ever heard. I have to admit that the singing by Rosie isn't the best in the world, but she admits to it everyday, and besides i think she was on key and did pretty well...hey her primary focus isn't singing! but it's a blast because it shows us that you don't have to be the best at something to do it....do what you want and as long as it's your best right? My favourite track was little drummer boy...i love what rosie says at the beginning....hey folks, let's not leave it to Rosie, let's all start spreading the christmas chear...(her CD is a great place to get some from)....MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
5,Huge Rosie Fan!,I Love Rosie and this is the best Christmas CD of 1999! I can't wait until next Christmas for her next CD!
3,"Five stars for the cause,One star for allowing Rosie to sing","There are some extremely talented artists gathered here. Who in their right mind let Rosie sing on these tracks and hamper their quality? This could have been a perennial best seller like the first couple of A Very Special Christmas albums. Instead, it was a novelty item, selling only as long as Rosie had a tv program on which to promote it. Had Rosie merely sponsored the cd and not lent her less than stellar singing voice to the project, this album could have been making money for charity for years to come."
2,What's all the fuss?,"I only give it 2 stars, the artists are impressive but Rosie drowns them out with her off-key singing. If only she sponsored the album without singing along, it'd be perfect. Rosie, if you decide to make another holiday cd next year, put your name on it but let the artists sing by themselves. The only saving grace is the money that goes to children's charity."
5,A Step Above the Rest,"I must admit, I did not purchase this product from Amazon. We've had it as long as a can remember, but I would urge anybody to get their hands on a copy. The songs are touching (God Bless Us Everyone), adorable (Do You Hear What I Hear? with Elmo), and comedic (I Wanna Eat For Christmas). While I'm sick and tired of every tired out Christmas song and cheesy CD we have around the house, I can't help but popping this one in and enjoying it every year. It never gets old and with each year it brings back old memories of wonderful times. For me, it definitely goes above and beyond other holiday CD in that it is catchy and memorable. Definitely give it a listen. You wont be disappointed."
4,The 1st two songs are terrific!,"I agree with what one reviewer said. The first two tracks on this CD were worth the price, in my opinion. I love Celine's Magic of Christmas Day and Cher and Rosie's duet on Christmas (Baby Please Come Home). Both terrific and upbeat songs. We get to hear Billy Joel do a Christmas song for the first time and Elton does a holiday song other than Step Into Christmas. The kids will like the songs featuring Elmo and the Rugrats kids. Trisha does a nice country number with Santa on the Rooftop. My favorite tracks are:The Magic of Christmas Day - Celine DionXmas (Baby Please Come Home) - CherGonna Eat For Christmas - Gloria EstefanWhite Christmas - Elton JohnWinter Wonderland - Donny OsmondS. Claus is Coming To Town - Rosemary ClooneyA nice mix, Rosie's singing not withstanding. But the proceeds (at least a portion) go to kids causes and it's something new and different. I usually play my favorites from this disc at least a few times during the holidays."
5,Lighthearted & Fun,"I really feel sorry for some of the people who have written scathing reviews of this album. I personally don't agree with Rosie's politics, but this is one of the best Christmas variety albums I have ever heard. Rosie makes no pretense about being a great singer, but she can carry a melody surprisingly well. Lauryn Hill's ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is the best version of the song I have ever heard, and there are many other great tracks on here as well. I have scores of Christmas albums that I no longer listen to because they have become stale; I doubt that this one will ever end up on my discard pile."
4,good stuff!,"This is a very good Christmas CD and Rosie doesn't sound half bad, but I can definitly do WITHOUT the retarded Lauryn Hill drummer boy song. Other than that, it's great!"
3,Where's the Obnoxious Elf (Kristen Chenowith)?,"If only you'd added the ""Christmas Chorus Line Medley"" with Kristen Chenowith. We can't get enough of Kristen Chenowith's talents, and that number was really novel!"
1,Terrible,"I like Rosie alot, and it's wonderful that she does so much for children and charity, but this album of holiday hits just doesn't do it. I looked forward to hearing her duet with Billy Joel on 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' but was very disappointed, the arrangement is extremely slow & their voices just don't blend well. And as for 'Christmas(Baby Please Come Home)', Darlene Love doesn't have a thing to worry about, her version is & always will be the best. Rosie, you are terrific but this cd could be alot better. I'll probably be the lone reviewer with a 1 star rating, but hey, this will still sell millions of copies and it is, after all, for a very worthy cause."
2,The book bombed!,"The Princeton Review prep-book of the New SAT is not worth it! It begins with ""the average highschool student, Joe Bloggs."" Not only did the book keep refering to Joe, it makes the student reading the book and studying feel like an idiot.The strategies the book employs are flawed and do not work. They go over every single detail and step, and it got to be really boring. The book spent most of its time explaining the small details, which got super boring really quick. I do not recommend this book, unless one naturally does not test high on the SAT test, then the explaining of every detain might be nice.If one wants a really good and excellent SAT prep book, check out the Rocket Review by Adam Robinson, which I would say is the best book to prepare for the new-SAT!"
1,Worst Review Book Out There,"This has got to be the worst SAT prep book I have gone through. The practice tests are riddled with mistakes. Even the online test has mistakes (i.g. Explanation makes sense for the choice that is not the correct one). The strategies are also misleading. If you believe you will ace the SAT with these srategies, you are sadly mistakened. If you follow this book, you will wind up guessing the entire exam. If you are serious about the SAT, avoid this book."
1,disapointed,I was hoping for a Historical Fiction book list for someone who loves history. The book disappointed from the start.
5,The Coolest Thing Ever!,Before my birthday i wasnt sure what to get and i went to Toysrus.com and i looked under sports and looked at baseballand then football and i saw the coolest thing ever! So my grandma takes me ut fo my birthday to the mall and lets me get 3 things of what i want! So iwent to Toys r Us and i got it! I love it so much! Its pretty loud by while your playing it dosent bother you at all! If your a beginner its pretty tough but youll get the hang of it! Also (thank God) it uses AC not batteries!! So i definetly recommend this great toy and Toys R Us!! Thankyou!!
4,Everyone loved it,"The game was a birthday gift to our 6 year old grandson. He just loved it asdid his father, an avid football fan and one who had a similar game when hewas young, his mother, another football fan, and his 10 year old sister.They all set it up and began playing immediately."
2,Not worth the money,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son who is 9 years old. And I am very disappointed. The men do not go the way they are suppose to go and the game itself does not work the way it is suppose too. He has not played again after the first day he opened it because he get's to frustrated. It was not worth the [$$$] that it cost me with shipping.
3,I Found them Mediocre,"This is the second of two CPO discs devoted to the four symphonies of early Romantic composer Georges Onslow, known primarily for a heap of quintets and other assorted chamber works. Unlike the reviewers who preceded me here, I did not find much to admire in this music -- to me it's repetitious and meandering, without a lot of development or personality. Think of Mendelssohn's lesser orchestral work and move it down a notch and you pretty much have what's on this release -- pleasant, yes, but certainly no great shakes. If you're bound and determined to sample Onslow's symphonic output, I'd suggest you try the companion disc that has the Nos. 1 and 3. The former has a good first movement, and the latter is quite engaging after you get past its own somewhat dull initial segment."
3,Could have been more informative.,"There is not a lot of information about expecting a baby. It did not really open conversation about having another child in our home, but my son like books so it wasn't a total waste."
5,Great read,I loved this book. My Mommy downloaded it for me and I read it to my baby sister. we both loved it
4,Sweet,"This book is a sweet for young children. My granddaughter enjoyed reading it and continues to read it over and over again. Having purchased the Bernstein Bears books for my children in the past, I knew they would be a great read for my grandchildren ... and that stood true. These books also meet reading requirements for younger readers. I definitely recommend this.This book is entertaining.

4,Great!,Thanks for your services. Great book. My daughter loves it. Preparing her for becoming a big sister in a short time.
2,Outdated,"There was too much emphasis on brother bear getting a new bed, not enough of what it's like to have a sibling."
4,"Good, but...","My daughter will be 3 when her little brother arrives; we got her this book to talk a little about what it's like to be a big sibling. It does a nice job in general of introducing the idea that things will change and you'll be expected to give away some of your old stuff to the new baby, but it was really weird how they just glossed over the whole baby part. In the morning, they just decided to clue the big brother in to the fact that mom was pregnant and when he and his dad came back from building his bed- BAM!- there was his little sister in his old bed. But, it's a kids book and just one of the many we got to prepare her so it's no big deal, I guess. Just a little odd..."
4,Must have for first time siblings,"My daughter is two and loves this book. It has helped us to explain what's going on with mommy's growing belly and also why we are moving her in to a big girl bed. It is shorter than most Berenstein Bears books, so great before nap time."
4,new baby book,Sent this to my grandson for his birthday. he is expecting twins at his house in the fall. he is enjoying the book and hopefully it is going to make the transition easier
5,Sweet!,"I bought this book as part of a ""big sister"" gift bag for a co-worker's daughter, who is four. It is adorable and I look forward to giving it to her. Also, the package arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I couldn't be happier!"
2,Isn't this a book about a new baby?,I was disappointed to find out that this book had very little to do with having a child adjust to a new baby. The majority of the book is about Papa Bear and Little Bear going into the woods to make a new bed because the old one was too small. Little bear kept asking what would happen to his new bed and when he returned there was a new baby in his old bed. I'm just not sure I thought this was a good book to introduce the concept of a new baby. Although I like the series I would avoid this book for its purpose.
2,Not good for showing what happens when new baby arrives,I was dissappointed in the book because I was looking for something to read to my 2 year old which would help her understand what things would be like when new baby gets home. It doesn't even scratch the surface of that topic. It mostly talks about the older child outgrowing his bed and getting a new one so that the new baby can have his old bed.
1,Not the best book for a sibling-to-be,"We were given this book for our son when I was pregnant with our second child. It's not one I would recommend to any other expectant family -- you can really tell it was written in the early 1970s, its description of the birth of a new baby is so strangely indirect (the pregnancy is discussed very little -- the focus of the story is mainly on building a new bed for the older sibling!) My son also found it upsetting that the son and father in the book go off for the day, and return home to find that, surprise, the baby has been born while they were gone -- he said, ""Didn't the mommy go to the hospital? Didn't the daddy help her? Was she all by herself?"" Not the best choice for your older sibling-to-be -- we recommend Joanna Cole's books I'm a Big Brother and I'm a Big Sister instead."
1,So disappointed!,"As a lover of Berenstain Bears books since I was a small child, I was horrified to read this book! All the other reviews capture all that is wrong with this book. We have relied on the Berenstain Bears to get through to our 5 year old for years, so I trusted that this book would help explain a new addition to our family. I could not have been more wrong! It turned into a discussion on all that was wrong with the book- Very confusing for a child. The Berenstains should SERIOUSLY consider rewriting this book as a service to their loyal fans. I must say, this book is atypical and the rest of the series is FABULOUS!"
4,Case for Samsung SPH-A640 cell phone,"The case for Samsung SPH-A640 flip phone that I bought is sleek and fits the phone well. The design is good, case has two sections which can be put on each section of the flip phone separately. It appears durable. It is good value for money."
5,excellent coverage of neural basics,"This book, more than any other on the subject, remains my bible. Neuron to Brain is good, as well as some others, but this remains the clasic tome. Highly recommended."
