5,A++ Great for whole family,"I started watching these videos on PBS and was totally hooked after watching just one! I started buying all the videos and I watch them with my whole family and even though I am the only one with only a moderate hearing loss the kids think it is great that we have our ""secret"" language that we can do in restaurants and other places that they need to be quieter in. It has been great fun! I would recommend watching the whole series! Great job Rachel!!! ***** 5 huge stars! The cartoon character Hopkins is great and the songs are very catchy..I sing them all day long with the hand motions!"
2,No what I expected,"We tried this dvd after my son learned from and loved ""My Baby Can Talk - First Signs"". However, tbis dvd did not hold his attention or provide the simplicity and connections that he needed between the signs and the actual words or objects. It was disappointing, especially since he learned to sign several objects and even say a few words from watching ""My Baby Can Talk"". We watch all dvds together and follow the recommendations in the tutorial on the dvd. I cannot recommend this dvd. If you are spending the money and the time to help your baby communicate with you, buy the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series, watch them and sign together."
3,A good start!,This video is a great place to start if you know little to no sign language. The signs in this video are simple and easy to learn.
3,Slow but Good,"This DVD is a great place to start. However, lined up next to the other Signing Time DVDs, it pales in comparison."
3,i learned but,I learned a little however after half way point it replays ep so really should only he half hr long and also its lacking all the songs that made the show and makes the dvds great.
3,Good but very short,"I wish for the price I paid the show would've been longer or at least had more words to learn. My son loved watching it but then again, he's only 7 months old, the lengthy scenes for each word didn't leave much time for more words. At this age I think it's better to learn the words yourself & teach them day to day instead of learning from a DVD."
2,signing time volume 1: My First Signs DVD,"I can't tell about the content of the product, because it arrived broken, actually split in two. My schedule is so busy at this time, I haven't had a chance to return the broken DVD for a workable one. I hate returning things even though I know your company takes effort in making it easy and simply. I will eventually returnthe DVD, but wanted to let you know of my feeling about receiving a broken DVD. I had plans of sharing with my grandson who was visiting, hope to get it by the next time he visits."
2,18 signs for $$,"For that price I would have expected more signs. The woman who explains the sign first does not appear to be comfortable in front of the camera and I also felt that each sign got too much time (i.e. it's the kids going over and over it again).I would have preferred more signs related to ones introduced. For instance: ""eat"" should be accompanied by the signs for banana, apple, orange etc.While it's cute to begin teaching your baby the signs for dog, cat and bird, I would have rather liked to learn signs that are related to everyday stuff: foods, sleep, play etc."
1,Do not recommend....,This video was poor quality. (It almost appears like a home movie). I was very disappointed in this product and returned the other unopened dvd's in the series. I purchased the dvd's to teach my babies how to sign. This was not the best video for a parent... the video primarily shows little kids doing the signs. The songs are annoying as well. I was honestly surprised at all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. It was awful.
5,best video for babies,"I started showing my baby this video at 6 months, it is still his favorite! He's now 12 months and recognizes about 6-10 signs. He doesn't seem to have the dexterity to do the signs yet, but he clearly understands the most important ones so far like eat, more, milk (nursing), water, dog, cat, banana. My husband and I now use the simple signs if we're out in a loud place and can't hear each other. Furthermore, I am a pediatrician and show the 3 volumes of signing time in my office. I encourage everyone to learn the basic signs and especially all children with hearing or learning disabilities."
5,FANTASTIC signing video for little kids!!!!,"This DVD is entertaining and educational. My 3 1/2 yr old sits and watches this video over and over again. The presentation is informative and captivating.....the DVD is over before you know it and retention of the information is quick and easy for the littlies.I have had other videos which were either dry or silly in their style of presentation....my kids soon swap the cassette to something more interesting. This DVD keeps them tuned in!!If you are looking for a simple, beginners video so your kids can simply have fun exploring the world of sign language and be able to walk away with a small vocabulary after just one viewing....this is it.I highly recommend this DVD."
3,Not as good for babies/toddlers as Baby Signing Time,"I bought this DVD along with Baby Signing Time Volumes 1 and 2. My daughter is only 15 months old and she LOVES the baby versions. This version, Signing Time, has mostly the same signs but it's presented in a format that's definitely better for older children (fewer cartoons and shots of babies, less sing-songy, etc). It's probably great for 3-6 (?) year-olds. For babies and younger toddlers, go with Baby Signing Time."
4,These are wonderful videos,"I don't let my son (who is hearing) watch TV or videos, except these. He's 14 months old and has been learning ASL for about two months now. He can sign eat, more, bird, dog, all done, airplane, cereal, banana, daddy, mommy and now, my favorite, sleepy. He loves these videos and ""asks"" for them all the time. I do the signs with him all the time, too, so I can't say how much he learned from the videos vs. from me, but come to think of it, he knows the sign for cat and I don't think I taught him that one. I wish the shots of Alex and Leah in the treehouse were more close up and didn't have such a busy background, but in general I think these are very high quality."
4,If you have the baby signing time DVDs then you won't need this one,"This is pretty good, but if you already have the baby signing time DVDs then you won't need this one, as it basically covers the same signs. Cute to see Leah and Alex so young, though. They did a great job!"
5,Fantastic show!,"My toddler loves this show and is soaking up the signs. We are up the fifth in the series already. We almost like this series as much as the ""Bounce!"" series (also on Amazon), but the ""Bounce!"" songs are a lot less annoying to parents. Both are great shows though, and signing is a great skill for kids. Highly recommended!"
5,My 1 year old LOVES THIS!,I have the first and second volume of signing time. Volume one is by far better then the 2nd one. Very cute songs and keeps my son involved in the show. He tries to sign just like the other little children are. I believe in no time we both will be signing back and forth to one and other. Great DVD. =D
4,Very pleased,My daughter loved this DVD and it kept her attention which is hard to do at 10 months. I would recommend this DVD to any and everyone with young children that want a better way to communicate without being verbal
5,Excellent! They really work. I have all 6 Volumns,"I bought vol. 1,2,and 3 when my son was about 2 years old. My son is developmentally delayed high functioning PDD. At first my son did not seem to enjoy them. I was going to give up. All of a sudden, my son started saying words, and doing the signs. Last year I sent these DVD's (vol 1,2, and 3) with my son to his school. My son's is in an autism program. His teacher, and speech therapist at school thought they were great. The music is great, and makes signing fun. My 17 month old daughter has been watching these videos and, she already knows several signs as well as words. I would start watching vol 1 & 3. Then move on to vol 2. Later I purchased Vol 4,5, and 6 which we also enjoy. I want my daughter to master the first 3 before we move on. My son is 3 years old now, the video's are helpful. He still enjoys the videos, our entire family does. The video's are a great compliment with what my son is learning in school. Signing Time is a lifesaver."
4,Five Star quality but three star prices,"These videos are wonderful, and my baby loves them. The instructions are clear and accessible, showing multiethnic children doing each sign, with cute music and graphics.To see a sample, go to their website ..., where you can also directly order the videos. Their customer service staff was very prompt and helpful.These videos are very expensive @ [money] for 30 minutes and about 15-20 signs per video."
5,Extremely Helpful in the Development of our Children,"Signing Time is far more then just entertainment! The most common reason for children to throw a temper tantrum is their inability to speak and communicate their feelings. With the use of sign language children learn to place a value on hand motions to express what they want thus making them happier, smarter and easier to parent. This video series has accelerated my 2 year old's learning potential and ability to speak. There is no doubt about it that these videos are responsible for growing my relationship with my son."
4,Content of DVD Great--Quality of Volume BAD,This series is great! Keeps my baby interested and she tries to sign what they're doing in the video. But the DVD (at least just mine) hardly has any sound. I have to turn my TV waaaaaaaaaayyyy up in order to hear it. Goodness forbid if I forget to turn the volume down before stopping the DVD! So I'd recommend trying to find when Signing Time is on TV and record it (great if you have Tivo).
4,well made,"the dvd is very well made. it catches me totally and music is great. it is almost perfect, exept my boy,16 months, don't buy it. that's why it gave 4 star."
4,Entertaining for baby,It amazes me that people can give this one star. I gave it 4 and not 5 only because the price is more that I believe is fair. It's great for my 14 month old. She watched it all the way through the first time and was totally entertained the entire time.
5,Signing Time w/Alex & Leah,Very good signing video - All my kids like it - I would like to order the next one - however - seemed expensive.
2,"Upgraded, but not sadly not improved","This is the first time I've ever reviewed a product. I have to say I was sadly disappointed. I checked the ""original"" DVD out from the library and loved it. I enjoyed all the little songs and the words that were taught. When I went to purchase it, I noticed that they had the ""new & improved"" version. I was so disappointed when I got it. It only has 2 songs (that really don't even go along with the words that are taught) and it's way too visually stimulating. I also missed some of the words that were taught on the first video and not on this one. I guess I learned my lesson that newer versions aren't always better ones!"
5,Fabulously simple and delightful,"My two year old son, who is not deaf, loves to watch this video for fun, and is already making a few signs after only a few days with the video. Given his hyperactivity, and short attention span, I'm very impressed.I also really like how upbeat and excited the video is about sign language -- it celebrates the beauty and fun of American Sign Language in a pleasing and simple format, instead of overwhelming your tike with a bunch of things to memorize."
5,superb DVD,"I love this series and plan to buy more. It is well done. The signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting, or watch the whole dvd. The word is first shown, then a mom shows the sign, then kids demonstrate (including some use of the actual object, if appropriate). My child and I have both picked up signs quickly from this DVD."
5,The Begining of great fun,"Great signing training for you and your child... funny, easy to mimick, and a great toddler pleaser. Great for a gift and christmas stocking stuffer."
4,Good Toddler Signing Reinforcement,"I liked that this supports signing for toddlers, but truthfully it did not teach my daughter signing. The most important factor is parents working with the child - use this as a reinforcement."
5,Every child should have this!,"If you are wondering about a great video for your toddler or child to watch, this is it!Volume 1 is a basic introduction to the words toddlers would most use. It is very easy to follow.Signing Time is a great way to introduce children to a second language, ASL. It is also the perfect way for babies to communicate before they develop speech. I can't count the times we've prevented a temper tantrum! These videos have really given my daughter confidence because she knows she can use signs to tell us what she wants, even when she does not know the word or cannot yet speak it clearly. These videos have also given us a great way to communicate with my young cousin who is disabled, and any Deaf people we may meet. Be sure to check out www.signingtime.com!"
5,These videos are SOOOOO GREAT!!!,"My two year old has been watching these videos since he was nine months old. He started signing after about a month of watching the videos (and lots of signing from Mom & Dad). It was so helpful to be able to communicate with him before he could talk, and it was even useful when he would try to speak and we couldn't quite understand his words. He would just sign and then I would verbally repeat the word he was saying. Then he would speak the word again. It cut down on communication frustrations - his and ours.These videos are by FAR my son's favorites. He asks to watch these movies even more than his Elmo/ Sesame Street and Dora videos.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these videos. I can't wait til the new videos are released. Hopefully that will be soon!"
1,Better References Available,I was extremely disappointed in this video. There are far better references out there to teach children. The quantity of signs provided was poor and the value for the cost was also poor. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the books Amazon has online - there are much better references available to teach your children than this video.
2,A little control freakish,"Admittedly, this book is now a little dated, but I just came across it at a friend's home and thought that I'd read it. There is many items worth looking at, but overall the information is available in other books and easier to find."
3,Decent Gemmell book,"I would consider this to be one of Gemmell's weaker works (for reference, I consider his Troy series to be his best). It seemed to me that he ""jumped the shark"" a little bit when he went into the parallel universe. Granted, Gemmell has a tendency to do the ""multiverse"" thing but it usually works, in this case I just didn't feel that it did. Since it is Gemmell it is worth reading, but just not up to par with his usual standard."
4,"Why do ""nice guys finish last""? Exhale and find out.","Angela Benson finally answers this age-old question. Women say they want men who will love them and be responsive to their needs. But, as Reggie Stevens learns, what women say they want and the men they choose aren't always the same. Reggie Stevens is a nice guy that Angela Benson fans will remember from ""Bands of Gold."" He was SO nice, he offered to marry a pregnant woman who was in love with someone else. Reggie's the quintessential nice guy. So, when a national magazine runs a contest, ""The Nicest Guy in America,"" several women who have dumped Reggie nominate him for the dubious honor. Editor Kimberla Washington is given the assignment of finding out why nice guys finish last. She uncovers a lot more than the truth in this very heartwarming story. Sisters who are waiting to exhale and brothers who are just waiting might learn something from it."
3,Stated off great,This book started off great but slowly died. I had to skip a few pages inorder to get to the end. I was a little disappointed in this book because the concept was great but the story fizzled out.
5,"Paperback, not hardcover!","I ordered this book used from fivedollarbooks (aka Candlewood), and returned when I saw it was a paperback. Condition was satisfactory, but I wanted hardcover specifically. The seller gave me a full refund, even refunded all shipping. After a month, Amazon still has not corrected the description above. Check with the seller to be sure you are getting the edition you want.There is a hardcover version available from Amazon, but it does not include Mythopoeia.Regarding the content, wow! ""Leaf by Niggle"" alone is priceless. Like Niggle's leaf is to a forest, so this story is to Tolkien's larger works: smaller, but not lesser."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Tree and Leaf is still more of Tolkien in the mode of historian, andTolkien in the mode of poet. The Homecoming of Beorthnoth is perhapsthe best part of this book. Again, only to be recommended for those wholike that sort of detail, his style, and poetry, otherwise not verymany will be interested if just fans of his major fantasy adventures."
4,inspiring examples of integrity....,"....whom I wouldn't have chosen myself but whose stories I found interesting. A good book to read when tempted to believe that politics is only about corruption and lack of accountability; for the men written about here, it was about principle."
5,Profiles In Courage,"This is a book about the most admirable of human virtues - courage. Grace under presure. ""Ernest Hemingway defined it. And these are the stories of the pressures experienced by eight United States Senators and the grace with which they endured them"".John F. KennedyDuring 1954 - 1955, John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. Senator, chose eight of his historical colleagues to profile for their acts of astounding integrity in the face of overwhelming opposition. These heroes include John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benson, and Robert A. Tft.Awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1956. Profiles in Courage resounds with timeless lessons on the most cherished of virtues and is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. It is, as Robert Kennedy states in the foreword, ""not just stories of the past but a book of hope and confidence for the future. What happens to the country, to the world, depends on what we do with what others have left us."
4,Profiles in Courage,"I was in college when the book was written, but never got around to reading it. The writing was not great, but the stories were inspring."
1,BORING!,"I am in the 9th grade at Holland Jr. High and my class had to read this book. I started it one night, got two paragraphs in and quit...it is SO boring! I dont understand why we have to learn about guys who have showed courage in the past, yea, maybe just briefly, but why in so much detail? Although the book has a nice format and is well written, it is only for those people who like to read boring stuff like autobiographies. I would not reccommend this nook to anyone!"
5,Profiles in Courage,Truly inspiring. I gave it to an exchange university student from China who wanted to explore what true leadership was all about.
4,Excellent,"President Kennedy certainly had courage in writing this book. This work is an important document that anyone involved in politics, or any form of leadership should not miss. Kennedy does an amazing job of looking at couragous policiticians from both parties and how they impacted their time and their country. I read this book in a few days and could not put it down once I started to read it. Before anyone serves in government at any level, they should read this book."
3,Not read for pleasure,"Profiles in Courage isn't meant to be a book that you sit down and read for pleasure. It is more of a resource to do papers, not entertainment."
2,I can't stay awake when I read this book.,"I am currently in 9th grade and am reading this book for the first time. It's a GREAT book...if you're looking for something to put you to sleep. I hate this book! I can't read it for more than 5 minutes at a time! Why do I have to read this book? I'm sure JFK had a good reason for writing it, I just don't see why innocent 9th graders have to learn why! I mean, who actually cares how many jobs John Quincy Adams had? I have much more important things to do than use my time to read this book, but unfortunately I have to read it anyway because it's 1/4 of my grade."
2,not worth the time - it's boring!,"This book is definitly not for 9th graders. We have to read it for social studies because we have a big test on it, but if you don't have to read it - don't! I don't recomend it unless you are doing a report, because it is very boring and definitly not worth the time!"
2,Good if you like politics. a lot.,"I had to read this book for my ninth grade humanities class, and I did not like it at all. It was boring, repitious, and unclear of his point. He never actually states what exactly makes one specific person couragous. THe only thing that kept me focused was taking notes. The only profile that actually had impact on me was Edmund G. Ross, when he cast the deciding vote for Andrew Johnson's impeachment. That, I think, was a very brave and courageous act on his part, since it literally ended his career. That was the only one i thought was worth reading. I do not recommend this book to anyone, unless you truly enjoy reading about politics, and like very small print. I would not read this book by choice. It would be much better for adults to read."
2,Why should 9th graders read this book???,"O.K., J.F.K. was a great man and wrote a very good book. It was true, well written, and informative, but a book about dead senators doesn't really interst a 14 year old 9th grader. I must admit that some parts, VERY few, were interesting, but I don't really care for this book. Actually, I hated it and would never bother to read it again! No offense to the people who gave it 5 stars, but your nuts!!--not really, I just think that this is a book for older people, not kids. And if we have to read it it should be in High School or College, no Jr. High. I would only recommend this book to old people, I mean older."
2,This book was written very well but was borring for kids.,"This book may have been written very well, but as a kid I found it boring. There Really wasn't anything in there to keep my attention. It was basically all facts about Senators that were alive many years ago. I don't think this book should be required reading because it really doesn't have any relevance to today's world. JFK should have made the book on the Senators that were in office durring the time that he wrote it and not on the Senators of the past."
2,A historical book that doesn't hold your interest.,"Even though I wasn't around during President Kennedy's term in office, I've always heard that he was a terrific President. However, he wasn't a writer. This book is heavy on the facts, but too light on interesting sections. Most of the Senators highlighted in this book seem to have done practically the same couragous acts at different times. Also, those acts were woven around dates and names that seemed to take away from the story. If you are a big history-buff, I would highly recommend this book. However, if you're looking for an enjoyable pleasure book, I would recommend you look somewhere else."
1,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG BOOK,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG BOOK!I needed this book for MY HISTORY CLASS!You just messed with a full time students semester.What kind of a business are these guys running.
3,Very Enlighting,"The author has chosen eight United State Senators to show how courage can be revealed. When I first considered the title I was thinking of courageous acts of war or rescue. So it was really nice to find the story illuminated another type of courage, the courage to maintain your convictions when all around you withdraw their support for you. In some cases the courageous man didn't live long enough to be vindicated. This reading required me to further seek out reminders of the social and political climate in the time period each story was told. This should be a must reading for anybody considering going into politics."
5,An excellent reminder of the importance of our Constitution!,"John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning book is a must read for all Americans interested in the importance of statesmanship and the courage to place principles above personal profit. Each chapter details the works of a U.S. legislator who made a significant impact on the credibility of the United States Constitution, often putting his or her career on the line to defend the foundations of the American republic. Many of these legislators are rarely spoken of today, but the continuing tradition of the democratic process of this nation owes a deep sense of gratitude to these statesmen.At a time when many of us are questioning the character and the ambitions of our political leaders, this book is a worthy reminder to us that a few good people can make the difference. This book is timely and pertinent when cyncism abounds in the minds of many voters and taxpayers."
2,Don't read this for pleasure!!,"I read this for school and found it hard to pay attention to what had happened to each senator. JFK does go into great detail through out the book talking about a senator's personality and the sacrifices they made on their career to vote on what they believed in. The book would be perfect if you want to learn about any of the senators, but I wouldn't read it twice if I didn't have to."
4,Profiles in Courage,"I bought this book to use in my American history classes. I read this book many years ago and liked it very much. Students today, need to know that some people have the integrity to do what is right no matter what the consequence to them may be. An example is the story of John Adams. He jeopardized his future to defend what he knew was right. It turned out well for him, but he did not know that at the time he defended the British soldiers. Students need more good role models in their lives."
5,OUTSTANDING,Great service and arrived early. JFK WON TH EPUL. PRIZE FOR THIS AND WAS BOUND FOR GLORY AS A WRITER BEFORE HIS BROTHER JOE DIED AND FAMILY WANTED HIM IN POLITICS. I will use this Seller again!!!! ITS A GREAT BOOK Give it a try.
5,An Inspirational read in ugly times,"After having just experienced the very ugly, brutish, and nasty 2004 U.S. presidential election, I found myself emotionally beaten up and drained. Picking up this book was a quick way to lift my spirits.John F. Kennedy's (or whoever wrote it) short history of a selection of senators who, caught between swallowing their pride and supporting popular measures they believed were wrong and following their consciences and supporting unpopular ideas, chose to follow their own hearts and minds. Many of these men had their once promising careers ended early for their unpopular actions. Many made their decisions to support unpopular ideas at the most uncertain periods in American history, such as the time immediately preceding the Civil War or the post Civil War period of poverty and raw nerves.For anyone who is looking for a refresher of what makes the United States a truly great country, reading this quick and inspirational book is an excellent place to begin."
2,"Confusing, Confusing, Confusing",Well this was the most confusing book I ever read. The idea of what JFK tried to do was good but the actual book was way too drawn out and unclearly wriiten. To read this book you have to drink many cups of coffee so that you wouldn't fall asleep from bordum. I only recomend this book if you are interested in politics and if you have the time to read this book carefully so that you would understand what JFK is talking about.
2,Never again......,"Alright, now I'm not going to say that this was the worst book i ever read... because it wasn't, but it definately was not one of the better ones. Yea it was well written and had a very good point to get across... but it just wasn't one of those books that kids would enjoy reading."
2,"Good Book, Not For Anyone Other Than Social Studies Teachers","I thought the book was very boring. All the book talked about was senators from way back. There aren't many people today that are interested in reading about that. ESPECIALLY 9th Graders!This book is good if you need something boring enough to put you to sleep. If you enjoy books like that, or if you want to make your students suffer through a boring and pointless book, this is the book for you."
1,"""Profiles in Boredom""","Book Should be Entitled ""Profiles of Quotes"" This book though it has a good purpose (to recognize political courage) it's just a chronicle of quotes about eight ""courageous"" senators. The book is completely unoriginal, nothing is being said by John Kennedy, just a cut and paste job of quotes of other peoples views of the events in question. This book is dull, droning, monotonous, and I wouldn't recommend it except as a cure for insomnia."
2,"Long, Drawnout, and Repetative!","I would not recomend this book to a fellow student because I felt that it was not very amusing. Though the individual stories I found to be entertaning, only due to the fact that they are historical, the book was too drawnout. It seemed that the same thing occured in each of the courageous men's lives, they would stand up for what they belived to be right and then be disowned by their party. This was inspiring in the first story, and in the second, but when I got to the fifth story it became monotonous."
1,Don't Bother,Very weak. Sprayed weeds growning through wood mulch and only result was turning from green to yellow. Not strong enough.
1,Nothing happened,I dont know what happened. We followed instructions on spraying this over the weeds in between our stone steps but it seemed to have no effect.
3,good for the lulz,"As others have pointed out, this is not a refined, polished product. It reads and looks like a rush job, but isn't bad enough as to be incomprehensible--which is saying something, for Shakespeare. The comic doesn't offer much except that taking Macbeth into a futuristic setting is good for a laugh.I picked the book up at the local bookstore on sale for $3, and I'd say it's worth bargain bin prices."
1,Batteries no longer sold,"I love my Trilobite, but they are no longer sold in the USA and worse than that, the batteries are no longer sold and can't even be imported from Europe, where they are still sold, so you are buying a dead horse on this one."
1,"Absolute rip off, hire a maid","Bought the trilobite at a big box discount store at steep discount but the replacement filters (measuring about 2 inches by 8 inches, and not HEPA) cost a fortune, far more for a year's supply than the machine costs at full retail! Do your research before you make the same mistake I made. The filters have to be replaced every time the dust collection bin is emptied. Search the web for trilobite filters for the best price, do the math, and see for yourself. It's shameful what those tiny filters cost! Electrolux should be ashamed."
4,Love my Trilobite verses my broken again Roomba,I bought a Discovery myself to help with my asthma and only used it in my tiled kitchen/family room. A very easy floor to clean. My friends were so impressed 4 of them bought roombas and or scubas.... Well I'm sorry to say that 3 of them as well as I have had irobot replace parts and refurb machines (might I add ... we had no problem with customer service) until the warranty was up...Now they want another 100.00 for another refurb... Not getting it from me! I just bought the trilobite for $437.00 and for one it really SUCKS... not simply brushing the dirt but vacuuming it up. It is a true vacuum not a sweeper like the roomba's. And if you can afford to get real lazy you can get the Karcher RC-3000 RoboCleaner that even has a self emptying feature.
5,very happy,"very happy ,,,they shipped it and I received it,, in just a few days, I will tell other people about them and I will buy from them again, it is very nice that there are still company's out there that care about their customers,"
5,My 7 year old son loves these!,Honestly when I got these in they were a lot bigger that I had thought they would be! My son loves to play with them now but I'm hoping that I'll be able to one day make it some kind of decoration on the wall. Good price for an awesome product!
3,cool,I didn't read the title of this product description before I bought it. It was nice to get all the teams pennants because I gave a bunch of them out at work and around the neighborhood. They are quite small. (about 10 inches long)
1,Broken on arrival,"Right now my rating is 1 out of 5 due to the fact that it was broken when it arrived, may change when a new one arrives"
1,game,I order two separate ones - one froze after a minute or so and would not install and the other would not work on MacBook Pro so did me no good. Both claimed to be for Mac or PC.
1,Don't' Waste Your Time Or Money On This Turkey!!!,"Jan Michael Vincent at his worst! Terrible acting (not just Vincent but all the cast), lousy music score and sound effects! One half hour into it was all I could take! This one went into the round file without any regrets!"
5,Very good!,"I am going to college to get my degree in medieval literature and renaissance culture, and overall world history and this is a great book! Very interesting!"
5,KID INCENTIVE,"Sponge Bob gives kids an incentiveto eat macaroni & cheese, especiallyif they already like it.Quick & easy nutrition with protein & cheese."
4,an extremely helpful book - deceptively simple in style,"This book is a great introduction to how smart design of content and its delivery can facilitate its reuse in an organization. The author has a lot of experience and lays out strategy and advice in a very straightforward manner without jargon. Her examples are simple and nicely revealed and formatted. She always has the customer in mind. Throughout the book, one always has the sense of a person behind the deliveries obtaining benefit (this is so often missing, which is why so many of these type of endeavors fail). The book reveals the soup-to-nuts considerations for anyone wanting to create and manage an effective information delivery project."
4,Fun Book!,"I picked up the trumpet again after a 25 year layoff, and grabbed this book just for some fun stuff to play. The arrangements are fairly easy, and not too taxing on your range -I think the highest note I saw was a 'B'. The CD is better then I thought it would be, and is fun to play along with. It has sections written in where you're given the opportunity to improv. If you just want some fun tunes to play along with, it's worth the money."
2,Not a Good Dixieland Book,"The tunes are fine, but Dixieland is commonly played with an ensemble that includes a trumpet, trombone and clarinet. This CD contains none of these. Get the MMO Dixieland book instead. It's much more expensive, but has a really good Dixieland ensemble on the CD."
1,"Even on sale, this is a rip-off.","This game clock (I bought two) is very user-unfriendly, but you don't have to worry about that, because they don't work for long. I bought new batteries for each after some of the digital display characters started not to show up. It wasn't the batteries, so I pressed the reset button in the back. Now barely any of the characters show up on the display, making them illegible. Now I'm the proud owner of two unusable game clocks that I tried to save money on. Oh well....made in China, I guess I deserve it."
2,I just couldn't get into it...,I just had to put my 2 cents in & say that I don't think this book is as good as these other people stated. I forced my self to read it half way through & then I had to close it for good. I read 1-2 weeks per week 90% of them are historical romances & it may have just been the setting for me because I don't much care for the European settings but most books pull me into them regardless of that but that wasn't the case here. I found the book quite slow & boring. Because I didn't finish this book I wouldn't normally leave feedback but when I saw only 2 reviews & they were both 5 stars I though maybe I'd save some people from thinking this was that terrific of a book. You may have a different opinion if you love a Paris setting but for me I don't think that was the whole reason.
5,"2 UNLIMITED - "" SIMPLY THE BEST ""","2 UNLIMITED IS A HIGHLY POPULAR GROUP TO ME. AS A DANCE PERFORMER I FIND THEIR MUSIC IS SO EASY TO CHOREOGRAPH MY DANCE PATTERN TO. THE RELEASE OF THEIR MEGA HIT ""REAL THING"" IS PHENOMENAL. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC BECAUSE YOU WILL KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT- SERIOUSLY!"
2,Sappy romance,"This movie seems to have taken its inspiration from The Stepford Wives, except that all the men are perfect. The women are not bad, either, which makes for a pretty boring story. There are no real conflicts, no really hard choices. Noah and Allie supposedly argue a lot, but you never hear what they're fighting about. Some of it's just kind of stupid - for example, you would think that Allie would check the mailbox at least once in a year. Some of it's just a bit absurd - for example, why does Allie answer the door wrapped in a blanket? Noah starts off charmingly crazy - dangling by one hand from a Ferris Wheel - and quickly becomes dotingly earnest. Well, there's something to be said for men who are passionately devoted to their wives. But I'll let someone else say it."
5,Amazing!,"I saw this movie in theatres when it was first released, and again on DVD. Ryan and Rachel do an amazing job, and Nicholas Sparks makes you fall in love with the book all over again. Absolutely amazing!"
5,the notebook,This was the best movie i have ever saw. Ryan and Rachel were perfect for the part. Nobody else could have done as well as they did. They warmed up the hearts and made the tears fall.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Notebook is better in its ""past"" sequence than its ""present,"" but overall the movie is well-acted and succeeds in creating a likable couple and maybe bringing a tear or two to the eye."
5,"The Notebook, dvd","Great movie; touching, sweet, well-made. Starts out a bit slow, but picks up soon enough. Great acting and makes you think, if it's true love, it's worth the sacrifice. Buy it; you'll like it."
5,Wonderfully romantic!,"I've had this movie for a few months already but never really felt like watching it. The other night, I thought I would give it a try and it was wonderful! It had been a long time I had seen such a romantic movie. It's on the verge of being cheesy, but it's not, and it's just a wonderful story.I just wish a love story like that could actually happen in real life..."
4,Fine I guess,"I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day, its exactly what you would expect, gay and sappy, but I guess it was a good movie. Even if you're a dude expect to get a little choked up at the end"
5,Wonderful!!!,I rented this movie then when out and purchased it. I knew I would want to watch it over again and again!
4,Well done film,I have heard about this movie for yearsand missed it in theaters assuming that it was just another sloppy romantic movie aimed at women that traditionally I don't tend to like very often.I have to say that I was plesantly surprised at the film as a whole and enjoyed it. Highlights for me are Ryan Gosling as his natural portrayal felt real and honest and he deserves the acclaim he gets. Rachel McAdams was also good in her role as well. James Garner and Gena Rolands are beautiful in their roles and are wonderful to watch. The direction from Nick Cassavetes is very clean and he allows the natural performances to shine with the script. A solid film and well executed as well.
5,Very clever way to tell an important story.,Cannot say too many good things about this movie. All the acting is suburb. It tells a story that most of us will never have to experience and brings forth how fortunate we are not to have to go through this in our lifrtime.
5,the note book,it came befor I was told it would. It also plays very good. i will buy from you again and will soon. Thanks alot
3,DVD,Hi am sure the DVD would be fine but due to an oversite on my part I didn't realise it had to be played in a different region.Can't be bothered to return it.RegardsDaphne
5,sensational,"The Notebook was one of the best films I have seen in a longgggg time! It was so beautiful. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams we're amazing together. If you are planning on seeing this, which i HIGHLY recommend....bring ur box of tissues!! There isn't a dry eye in the theater!!!"
2,This is not romance.,"This was a good love story, a tear jerker, but it was not romantic. A real romance is not one where you have to go back and forth from one guy to another because you don't even know what you want. In a real romance, you just KNOW. Allie was portrayed as spoiled and wishy washy. I'm not even complaining of her infidelity, because I'm glad she made the right choice and chose Noah. But to think she could just sleep w/Noah and then go back to her fiance....thats just made me want to smack her. The older Noah and Allie were cute, but I just fell asleep when they came on.In the end, the only thing that held this ""love"" story together was the deep love Noah had for Allie, which was beautiful. Everything else was pretty dumb.I just hope young people don't watch this and think this is as good as it gets, cause it can be so much better."
4,I'm still a sucker,"...for these tear jerkers. This movie will go down as a romance classic- a forbidden love about two people from the wrong side of the tracks-Romeo and Juliet for the 1940's, if you will. This film hits all my cheesy love spots and turn up aces with me. McAdams/Goslin were great as well as Garner and Rowland. This is a must see for all Chick movie lovers. Highly recommended."
5,An undervalued timeless gem,"This movie can be summed up in one word - commitment. Noah (the husband) is faithful to his wife and in his own words he has loved someone with all his heart and soul and that is success enough for him.Yes, the story is a bit corny and simple but then these two people who met in 1940, married sometime in the late 40s and are STILL happily married in 2004, come from a simpler time.This is not about action, violence, sex or $$. If you don't understand the depth of love the two characters have for each other, then you don't understand the movie.Watch this movie with your significant other......this is not a chick flick. It is about the way marriage commitment should be...."
3,Rachel McAdams is an Up & Coming Movie Star!,"As is the case with the book, ""The Notebook"" is an unexceptional story. The overall experience is improved, however, by the presence of Rachel McAdams, one of the brightest stars in Hollywood today. This is McAdams' movie from start to finish, in spite of interesting performances by James Garner (my favorite actor) and Gena Rowlands. The character of Noah is not as appealing as he is in the book, and I think this makes Allie's dilemma less dramatic than it could have been. Parents beware that the sexuality in this movie is ""R"" caliber."
5,One of the best love stories around.,I loved this movie. It's right up there with The Thorn Birds. I loved the era and the characters and I couldn't wait to see who Allie winded up with. It's a keeper.
5,Astounding....,This is my new favorite movie! I can't wait until it comes out on dvd. My boyfriend and I cried so much through this movie. We were still crying as we walked outside of the theater! And we don't normally cry about a movie!! It's a must-see if you are into movies that actually have something deeper than just sex and violence. Anyone that I know that has seen this movie totally agrees that the Notebook is a classic!!! :)
5,One of my favorite 'coming of age' romances....,"Ally (Rowland) is a resident in a Senior Citizen's home suffering from dementia. Every day, a neighbor (Garner) comes to read to her from a handwritten notebook that tells the story of a romance between a couple named Ally and Noah. Ally loves the story and the company--and sometimes she remembers who her companion was. Both Garner and Rowland did an excellent job acting in a poignant tale about loss, love, and not letting go. This is definitely a five or six hankie story, but well worth it if you are interested in the romance genre."
5,Excellent!,I loved this movie! It was definitely a tear-jerker but worth seeing again and again.I can't wait to own this movie!
5,Who does not love this???,"What a wonderful story. Heartbreaking at times, but the most romantic movie i have ever seen. I was in tears most of the movie. Great Actors throughout. A must have chic flick!"
5,excellent product,it was just as expected i used the dvd as part of a raffle for a cancer fundraiser and it was deeply appreciated.
5,Awesome Movie,I never expected this movie to be so touching and endearing. What an aswesome movie. I can watch it over and over and it would still have the same affect on me. You can actually feel the love the main characters had for each other. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has been in love or long to be in love like Allie & Noah.
2,So-So,"This movie is very hopeless romantic, predictable. All in all, i found the movie to be BORING! Why? Just because it's so silly, and the story line wasn't all that great. I could fall asleep throughout the whole movie. I personally thought A walk to Remember was 10x better!"
5,The Notebook is great,This is a fantastically created story of a love that is everlasting and enduring despite the illness of the wife. It shows true devotion and love in a relationship.
5,Moving Tear-jerker with a Twist,"My daughter and I watched this together. I'm an old softy, known to cry over AT&T commercials, so my sobs weren't unexpected, but my stoic daughter was in tears, too. A great movie with a lot to say about love, passion and life-long devotion! Also, contrary to the usual reality, this movie is far superior to the book upon which it was based."
4,Don't watch it when you're sad!,"I thought it was a good movie from the beginning but didn't really understand what was the big deal about it. It was the end that made it for me. Last 10 minutes plus 1 deleted scene put it in a ""great movies"" category. Rachel McAdams plays an absolutely beautiful and, which is more important, totally believable character. I didn't like Noah character that much, he seems pretty boring and i don't see how such a girl could have fallen for him, but you never know:) Enjoy and don't watch it when you're sad!"
3,Didn't live up to the hype,I am a sucker for chick flicks. I love a good romance. This was not one. I cry at everything...I didn't shed a tear for this movie. Maybe it's because so many people told me I'd love it that I went into it with very high expectations. Maybe it's because the plot was so cliche that I felt like I already owned 5 other versions of it. The guy playing Noah was not good and often times too emotionless for his emotionless character.Over all it was okay. I'm glad I rented it free from the library.
5,the notebook,"my mom had same problem. i had to have this movie. so well acted. sad, breaks my heart. but so real. this is a movie people need to watch. so much of this happening today. great, great movie."
5,'The Notebook',"'The Notebook' is a very moving and emotional movie. Had seen the movie once before but my girlfriend Anita proclaimed it to be her favorite movie, so therefore I got her the blu-ray version for CHRISTmas, she absolutely loved it."
3,Shipping,"I have not received the product yet, but it still says it hasn't been shipped yet, though it says that it will arrive today. I placed my order four days ago, and this is quite worrying. I do not appreciate my order not being shipped until the day it is due for arrival. If it only takes less then a day, which is hard to believe, I do not understand why it had to wait four days and not the day after or at least two to three days after.GREAT PRICE THOUGH!"
5,wonderful,"I read the book, so I thought I wouldn't get teary from the movie. I also thought the movie might not be as good as, or just like the book. I was wrong. the movie was just as moving and very ownable. I, along with my three daughters and husband thought the movie was great! My sixteen year old daughter didn't think that the ""young Noah"" was a good choice when she started watching the movie, by the movies end, she thought that they couldn't do better with anyone else. All the characters were so believable! What a great job and wonderful movie."
5,Wonderful romance in a great classic movie,The notebook is the story of two lovers who come from opposite sides of the tracks and seem to have nothing in common but they are perfect for each other. It is told in a unique way. The audience sees an older couple and the man is reading the woman a story. Then we see the younger couple played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. They do a superb job of playing the young lovers and James Garner and Gena Rowlands match them are the couple when they are older. I really liked the way the story was laid out and even my husband enjoyed it. It is a romantic story for both men and women!
4,The Notebook,"This movie really touched my heart. The story line was awesome but the ending was a little bizarre. I have recommended this show to everyone I know as a real ""rainy day show"" and to definitely have a tissue close."
4,One of the Few Love Stories a Guy Can Sit Through,"My title says it all. The Notebook is not the greatest movie I have ever seen (as most women I know would claim), but it's worth your time if your girl wants to watch a sweet romance that won't put you to sleep. The beauty of Rachel McAdams held my attention throughout as did the well told story."
2,"Easy to download, just didn't like the movie","It was a very easy process ot purchase the movie, which I did on my computer, and then watch it from my Playstation, however the movie was just way to depressing for my taste. I don't like overly sad movies and this was a love story, but to not a happy one in my opinion. If you want to cry watch this movie, it will without a doubt fit the bill in that way."
1,Are you kidding???,"I read the book. I LOVED it! Couldn't wait to see such a lovely-simple book put into a movie.I was stunned. Did the screen writer even READ the book -- or is this the case of ""Moonlight and Magnolias""?(http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/chicago/ch34.html)I was truly disappointed! (So much so that I'm writing my FIRST ever ""review"".)"
1,Bad Review for copy of movie,WAS SEND A COPY NOT THE ORIGINAL OF THE MOVIE. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS PERSON! COMPANY CONTACTED ME THROUGH EMAIL STATING THEY WOULD SEND THE ORIGINAL MOVIE AND NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH. BAD PR!!!! COMPANY STATED NOT TO SEND BACK THE COPY AND THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WOULD BE IN THE MAIL RIGHT AWAY.
2,did i miss something?,"This was a good love story but how can that girl from a wealthy family and lifestlye so quickly fall in love with that boy from the other side of the track, financially speaking? Also when he jumped on that ferris wheel you would have to be a very trained stuntman before pulling that off! Also I noticed the boy all of the sudden grew nice thick facial hair to make him look older. come on now, that is too obvious for my taste. Plus any boy who takes pleasure in laying on the street in the middle of the night surely has some problems upstairs which makes me curious as to why such a nice good looking girl would ever join him, on the street. A lot of people were crying during this movie, not me though because I was too upset that other people around me would think i was the one crying. I have tears to shed but not for this movie. Ok, it wasn't a bad film but just not for me, thanks."
5,Evaluation of the notebook,"The item was sent in a timely manor and was recieved in a timely mammre, Would order again from your service."
4,You Got to Know What You're Getting Into,"Before you see this movie, you have to go into it knowing that it is a sappy tear-jerker intended to be lovey-dovey.Once you accept that, watch the movie and events unfold and you will fall in love with it. The cinematography is beautiful as is Rachel McAdams. The Notebook will renew your faith in the possibilities of perfect and passionate romance.For what this movie is, it is perfect."
1,"sappy dappy, unlikely, over-verbalised",Cliched characters. Unlikely outcome. They get together...they split up...they get together...etc...They talk lots about their feelings. The sexual mores of the time would hardly have been consistent with the amount of sh gging. Amazing how pregnancy not considered or discussed. Highly unlikely. I never want to hear another violin. The older characters are convincing but not the actors who play their younger selves but then the plot and dialogue so poor that no wonder.
1,I'd give it less than one star if I could,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and, except for Hollywood's built-in nepotism, would have not been made. My primary distaste for the movie and what distracted me from the ""story"" relates to the props and the over emphasis on ""perfection."" All of the signs for Coke, etc., were in perfect, unblemished condition. The shoes worn by the girl star were totally today's. The mother's French manicure made me want to set my hair on fire.... Help!!!Guess it's really no worse than the Thin Man series and other movies from the 30's and 40's where most of the characters are rich and overdressed and were intended to encourage the masses to go out and attain their own impossible dreams but not to my taste at all. At least the earlier ones could be entertaining."
5,Utterly Fantastic,There are some films that have touched me very deeply and have immediately become a favorite for life. This is one.
4,The Notebook,I had viewed this movie on cable. I then bought it for my Mom for Xmas. It is a tear-jerker but so believeable and down to earth.
5,Best Romance Film Ever!,This is the best love story I've seen since Titanic! Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling made a perfect match for this film :)!
5,outstanding movie,"This has got to be one of the best love stories of all time. I have not been touched like this in more years than i can say. The cast and acting were perfect. I dont buy many movies but this is on my wait list. It made me want to fall in love again, but not just any love, only a true one. I will watch this again and again."
3,"The book is better, but what else is new","I read the Notebook a few years ago and fell in love with the story. When I heard it was being made into a movie I couldn't wait. My expectations were so high. I've seen it and I'm a little disapointed. First of all the best part of the book was the letters they wrote to each other at the end. That was completly left out of the movie. Also I liked the original ending much better. This one was not as believable. All that aside, I did cry, it was a beautiful love story. The chemistry between the characters just didn't carry over to them in old age. I think if I had not read the book I would have enjoyed it more."
2,dislike,"the most pretentious, predictable movie. :/ i don't know why people refer to it as being one of the best romances... i normally like romance / drama movies but it's too predictable, no point watching when you know how it's going to turn out. i prefer titanic, the painted veil, romeo & juliet, benjamin button, atonement, etc to this. don't even get me started on superior foreign romances (moment to remember, frozen flower, my sassy girl). there are many more interesting romances than the notebook...maybe i just dislike nicholas sparks stories."
5,The Notebook,One of the best love stories I have ever seen. You better have plenty of hankies available when you watch this movie. I never get tired of watching this. It's great.
5,The Greatest Love Story since Romeo and Juliet!,"I have seen this movie twice now in the theaters. I absolutely fell in love with it. The story, and the characters, are heart warming.Keep tissues on hand, because it is quite a tear jerker. Please see this movie! It changed me emotionally."
2,Not worth it!,"Having read Nicholas Sparks previously, I knew that this would be a story to pull at the heart strings. However, I was just convinced that Allie and Noah had fallen in love - their characters seem to be ""one-note"". Ryan G. had a stupid look on his face most of the time, and Rachel M. did that funny high pitched laugh most of the time. And the ending was just too contrived. I did think that the visuals in this moving were stunning - that was the real star here!"
5,Great Love Story,"This is a great love story,unfortunately it had a very poor director and could have been so much more.She tells her fiance she loves him and wants to be with him less than 24 hrs after she just lost her virginity to Noah,than she goes back to live the rest of her life with Noah.Its great she ends up with Noah but whats with this director."
5,Renew your faith in love with this movie!,"I do not know about any of the other reviewers, but, this movie had me sobbing. His relentless and unending love would make anyone want that kind of lifelong partner. I have not met anyone yet who has seen this movie and not been touched by it."
5,WOW! Watch this movie with your special other!!,"This is one of the most moving movies I have ever watched. I have been with my husband for over eight years, and watching this movie made me cherish every moment that I get. It should come with a box of Kleenex as it's special feature. This movie was so wonderful to watch. I watched it with my husband and he was really touched as well. Sometimes we are just not given enough time, and we forget to take the time to enjoy what is going on around us. This movie was predictable, but I would watch it again in a heartbeat a true LOVE STORY!"
5,So beautiful,This movie made me feel so good inside. It gave me hope that there is true love out there. The movie is wonderful to watch.
1,Very sad-a tearjerker,"I borrowed my sister in laws DVD of this movie cause everyone told me how romantic it was. What they neglectecd to inform me was that it was an emotional roller coaster through out the movie in which I wanted to kick my tv, plus I didnt know I'd need to watch it with a whole box of tissues. I was either mad or cried throughout the entire movie! But I figured it was ok as long as it had a happy ending. I'm not gonna say too much there for those of you who hasnt see it yet, but what the heck was that ending about? That was soooo sad I was blubbering like a baby. Needless to say, after the movie I was so upset I actually threw the remote control. I have now boycotted the movie from my house. A little drastic you say? Not to somebody who used an entire box of kleenex throughout the movie. In closing, hated the movie! Watch at your own risk. (and with tissues)"
5,AWWWW!,"This movie was so sweet. It makes anyone want to find their special ""Noah"" or ""Allie"". Yes, it is definitely a chick flick but a very romantic one. So anyone who loves a heart wrenching romantic movie. This is for you."
5,Absolutely Spectacular,"This movie went far beyond my expectations. I'm not usually a fan of sappy romantic movies, but this movie was more than just sappy and romantic. Sentimental and old-fashioned, it told a real story, not to mention that the actors were just superb.I'm not usually one to weep at a movie theater but this movie definitely brought a few tears to my eyes, and I wasn't the only one. There weren't many dry eyes in the theater towards the end.I'll be buying this on DVD when it comes out, but for now I am settling with reading the book. This movie is definitely a must see!"
4,"Not Bad For A ""Love"" Story","I will admit that I am generally no fan of romantic movies - I hate sappy love stories. I first watched ""The Notebook"" on HBO. I was walking through my den and the movie was on. I sat down just to see what it was about and got really involved in watching it. The scene where Noah and Allie were standing by the pond in the pouring rain was on and I was pretty much hooked from there on out. I later rented the DVD and watched the entire movie from beginning to end. I have since watched it about 5 times over - it's just that good! It does have the classic overtones of rich girl meets poor boy, they fall in love - rich girl's parents (especially the mother) think the young man is not good enough for their socialite daughter. I can't really describe what makes this movie so good, but it is heartfelt and touching and will get you involved in watching it just to see how it ends."
5,Great Love Story,"I had heard of this movie before but there was no way I was going to watch a mushy love story. After someone recommended it, I decided to watch for myself. To my surprise, the movie was really good. It shows what true love is all about."
5,The Notebook (DVD),"This DVD came in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Thank you so much!.... ** This movie is WONDERFUl, but should come with a warning label... if you are emotional, be careful with this one! A great love story that you'll never forget."
5,One of the best summer films!,The Notebook was just absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Stellar performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. It was so nice to see Ryan playing this romantic lead instead of his more darker characters. Ryan is definitely a versatile actor. He's going to be around for a long time.
4,If you already own the original......,"I would not suggest buying this boxed set. I LOVE this film, it's probably my favourite film of all time. However, I purchased it believing there would be more to it than the stickers, stationary, and bookmarks it comes with. Yes, it does have a little collector's book (how nice) BUT I am a fan of the story, so for me, I would have liked to see more DVD extras instead of the paper stuff it came with.Bottom line, if you already own the DVD of this, then you already own this version as well--it's the SAME exact copy as what was released 4 years ago, you just get a pretty box and some paper to write on.......so save your money."
4,Love story,"I would whole-heartedly recommend this love-story to anyone who hasn't had a good cry in a long time. It is guaranteed to turn on the old tear-ducts, as well as lift your spirits and inspire you that the romantic purism of monogamous lifetime love can be and is a reality, at least for this young couple, of whom James Garner's character is reading about. Without giving away the plot of the story, James Garner is a very noble and loyal friend to a lady in a nursing home, reading her a story that was hand-written and personal. He never misses an opportunity to pick up where the story let off during her previous session-- sadly, she is suffering from Alzheimer's and it is a challenge for him to keep her interested in the story, although she is surprisingly receptive to it and is amazingly consistent in her following of the storyline. It's like two stories of two couples in one movie! Scotty/Sioux City"
2,Sappy love story....blah,"My gf pretty much forced me to watch this flick with her and I resented every minute of it. If you're a guy, I would highly advise against watching this movie. Very sappy."
4,A great love story that is sure to turn anyone misty eyed.,"Touching and sweet, even as a guy I thought this movie was good. The movie is well-written and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a very believable onscreen couple. A great love story that is sure to turn anyone misty eyed. See it, you won't be disappointed."
5,The Notebook,A mature look at the best we can come to as we age.James Garner is compelling with the most serious role of his life. Well Done
4,A Lovely Romance,"I am always torn on whether to give this one a four or a five. The reason for me is the end, which I won't say what that is for those who have not seen it. It's a very sad, romantic film. My sister LOVES it. She even named her son after the main character. LOL If you love tear jerkers you won't go wrong with this one."
4,The Notebook,"I loved the movie, but had a problem with the audio using my laptop. It was a little better on my desktop PC."
1,I had to give it that one star.,"This movie was terrible and great at the same time. The parts that take place in the present show vivid influence by Nicholas Sparks and are the cheesiest, most cliche scenes I have ever seen. The parts that take place in the past are very witty, cute, and funny. I, however, would rather drill screws into my feet than watch the ending or any of the parts that coincide with it. Whichever one you prefer, this movie mixes both crap and wit."
1,I'm in the Minority!,"Okay. Most of the reviews I've read have been A+, and I guess I really don't understand why. I can't remember the last movie I've seen that has affected me the way this one has. I'm not sad! I'm angry.First, the movie bored me to death. I thought it would never end. Second, I did not--repeat NOT--find the actors/actresses appealing, especially James Garner and Gena Rowlands. Third, I felt very manipulated. I knew exactly what was going to happen from moment to moment, and just about anyone who's seen movies for years (and maybe not that many years) can figure out the ending.On a positive note, I did enjoy the 40s stuff: costumes, cars, etc. And for that I give it one star."
4,Good movie,Very emotional movie and certainly what I would rate as a chick flick and/or a tear jerker. Don't watch before bedtime;)
5,A really good movie!,We saw this movie and it was really well acted and the story line was remarkable. The scenery as beautiful.
2,Not memorable,I just thought this movie was boring. I enjoyed the parts about the old couple but when it switched back to the young couple I just didn't find them appealing or believable. It is not a movie I would keep in my library or ever look at a second time.
5,great movie,"Great movie. Excelent casting, very good script and story. Some things same simples however hide deep feelings.A story about the truly love of a human been. A film for keep in your memory for long time."
3,"THE ""TYPICAL"" LOVE STORY",GOOD STORYLINE BUT TO PREDICTABLE. NEEDED A LITTLE MORE SPICE AND CURIOUSITY. GLAD I PURCHASE FOR LITTLE OR NOTHING. ONCE AGAIN THE SERVICE OF AMAZON WAS GREAT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
3,Good,"The movie was very good, but i was upset about the box, because the box was cut on the barcode part in bothsides. I supposed buy a new movie not a promotional cut movie.Thanks,Juan."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!,"I watched The Notebook before I read the book, and I was amazed at how closely they followed the book. There were some places where they changed a thing or two, but for the most part they followed the text. Ryan Gosling is great as a young Noah Calhoun, and Rachel McAdams does an excellect job of portraying Allie Hamiltion. It was worth watching, and it is worth watching over and over again. Nick Cassavetes did an amazing job. Nick Sparks wrote such a moving love story, and I love all of his books. All of you, keep up the good work."
3,"The Hoopla, In Perspective","I couldn't find this movie to rent at my local video store, and I couldn't buy it at any store I went to. Everywhere was sold-out.It was with much anticipation that I ordered this movie. I was desparate for a good cry and had been told by a plethora of friends and relatives that this was the movie to watch. My sister even said that the devil probably wept when he saw this movie, as well.I popped my popcorn, grabbed my best friend, and sat down with a box of tissues and watched...and watched....and watched.Sweet movie, beautiful sets, pretty good acting skills....lots of great elements, but alas, no tears....Disappointment ensued, then the self-concious idea that I might be heartless, then anger, then I decided to move on.It's a perfectly lovely movie, but the story is, maybe, a little far-fetched. I'm sure stranger things have happened, and, frankly, there are some hot love scenes I wouldn't mind recreating.And there you have it. Still not sure what all the fuss is about."
5,Love love love,"Everyone should've seen this and if you haven't, need to hurry!I cry everytime. Love it. Love it love it!"
4,"Old-Fashioned, Cathartic Romantic Movie","This movie, while slightly bathostic, will soon be a classic in the world of tearjerkers. The plot has already been covered, so I won't get into that. However, this movie has a haunting quality that stays with you the day after. I spent the entire two hours between tear spells. The only problem is in the anachronism (ex., manufactured brown beer bottles in the 1940s) and occasionally frankly fake Southern accents. However, if you can get past that, this is a very enjoyable movie for anyone."
5,Lovely love story...touches your heart!!!!,"This is entertaining, more than 5 stars. Story carries you along and you are enveloped!!!!The characters are wonderful and you can feel their emotions.Great, great story!!"
3,If It makes your wife happy...,If It makes your wife happy on date night how bad can it be? The Notebook is a formulaic love story sure to please your S.O. I even found myself (Shhhh) liking it quite a bit.The screenplay and direction is better than most Romances. Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling are both very good in the film which manages to keep it's pacing even during slow periods.This one is worth a rental on Amazon Instant Videos or pick up the Blu ray if it's on sale for $9.99.
5,The Notebook,Want a good cuddle tear jerker to watch with your significant other? Build a nice fire and put this movie on the DVD. Guranteed to get results.
5,THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE EVER,"I have watched this movie about 5 times, and it gets me every time. try to watch it with someone you love. IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY & FALL IN LOVE alllll OVER AGAIN. its a wonderfull movie. ***** 5 stars"
5,Romantic,"This movie made me cry so many times, that I lost count. This is a romantic and breathtaking movie. The book is even better!!! This movie caught a couple of details that the book has, which for many movies this dosent happen.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that believes love is greater than anything."
5,The Notebook is the Best Movie,"I loved the movie The Notebook. The book was wonderful and so is the movie. I cried at the end of the movie. Story was great, actors were great. An A+++. Go buy it and enjoy....HB"
5,Movie Lover,"I saw the movie the day that it came out. After viewing the movie, I knew I had to read the book. The movie was good, but the book was great! Nicholas Sparks scored big with this book. I am forever greatful for his wonderful writing. THANKS!"
5,The notebook,"This film stars Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel Mc Adams (The hot chick, Mean girls.) The film is funny, sad and thought provoking all at the smae time. It sends out a brilliant message that anyone can relate to. It is the best love story I have ever seen and it deserves to be remembered as 'a true mother-daughter movie, no matter what the age.' Much better than Titanic and a movie I will be sharing with others."
5,"beautiful, almost made me cry","Yes i am a guy and i'm not a big fan of cheezy romantic comedies but this was not, it was a REAL emotional love story, it shows just coz you make a choice to be with someone doesn't mean it is the right choice, you must follow your heart if there is any doubt about a lost love. If there was a special movie i'd that i would watch with my girl i would choose this one."
4,"""The Notebook""","A sweet, tender love story told from present day by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, who revisit the fiery relationship of lovers struggling to reunite after world events pull them apart in the 1940's."
3,Thank You,I love this movie it portrays what love everlasting should and needs to be. I love the story line and how this movie ends in a happily ever after till death do us part way. Nicholas Sparks writes amazing stories of true love and everlasting hope and joy. Highly recomend the book and movie
3,Too Many Cliches for Me,"This is another movie I would rate 3 1/2 stars if it were an option. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it, particularly the parts where James Garner and Gena Rowlands portray the older Noah and Allie. I was extremely moved by their performance of a couple facing the end of thier lifelong romance. He as devoted to her as ever. The earlier years of them falling in love didn't really gel for me though, I think in part because the story involved just about every love story cliche that could be employed. Too overblown and contrived feeling for me and I don't regard myself as cynical and I have been fortunate enough in life to find my own Noah. Also, I did have a little bit of a hard time with the ending although I understand we as the audience are expected to make a leap of faith in believing they could will this to happen through the strength of their love, as per the conversation they have just before falling asleep."
5,A Cute Romantic Movie,This is a really cute romantic movie. The plot of this movie is really good. Rachel McAdams does a fantastic job in this movie.One of my favorite romantic movies.
5,Love this movie!,this is a great love story and I like the actors and actresses a lot! I would recommend this movie to the young at heart.
2,Smutty,"This could have been a very good movie but for those of you out there reading reviews be very careful before purchasing this movie to watch with the family. It really ought to have an ""R"" rating for sexual content and profanity. I have seen PG-13 movies and this one was racy. Ally as a teenager is allowed to run wild and free over the summer and gives up her virginity in graphic detail. She hates her mother and the only relationship with her father is being able to get anything she wants. Spoiled, rich, and w/o any apparent moral compass. Noah isn't much better as a young man. The story itself as told by James Garner in the latter years is pretty good as he deals with ""his sweetheart"" with dementia. I can relate to this aspect of the movie because my mother went through the same sort of thing. But Hollywood as usual has to ruin a good movie with sex scenes and profanity. I would not recommend this movie."
5,absolutely love,I love this movie. Great story that is being told and then it turns out to be the older man reading it to the lady hoping that she'll remember who she is for a while in her older age. I love how they never stopped loving eachother over the years. The love never went away. I love this movie and I had to have it in my collection. I could watch it over and over.
4,The Notebook,Romance in South Carolina. Noah and Allie meet in 1940 and fall in love. Their love survives the disdain of Allie's mother and a third party who temporarily wins her affection. The story is told in flashbacks by James Garner as Noah. He reads from a notebook prepared by an aging Allie as she sinks into dementia. Hearing their love story brings her back for fleeting moments. The couple die in bed together in the institution where she resides. I saw my parents and the passing of the World War II generation. This is a tearjerker.
2,Maudlin Manipulator Merits Mediocrity,"Cloyingly sweet tear-jerker that overflows with sentimentality that left this reviewer feeling emotionally manipulated. The first 20 minutes or so are soporifically boring as the two main characters meet and slowly fall in love. After that, the plot moves forward at a more rigorous pace. However, the plot revolves around the standard ""rich girl-poor boy"" device that has been done many times before, including their separation and reunion many years later. Then comes the dilemma of the woman having to choose between her current fiance and her previous lover. Snore.What is somewhat redeeming are the terrific performances by James Garner and Gena Rowlands who play the lovers in their old age. The ending is contrived, but will wrench tears from you nonetheless. Recommended for those seeking a romantic cry-fest."
1,I don't buy it,"I don't understand how people can say that they want a relationship exactly like Noah and Allie's.There was hardly anything to show that they actually liked each other for their personalitites. There is even one part when they start fighting and then making out makes it all better. And they decide to get married because they have good sex??I just do not believe that they were really in love.I admit that the parts with the older Noah and Allie were cute and more believable. I also do not see the significance of the two characters dying together (I myself do not find that romantic).Something else that bothers me about this movie is that it shows that the ""ideal"" relationship begins with adultery.Of course I am not solely blaming ""The Notebook"" for all the problems with the way teens think about love, but it certainly supports the attitude that love=sex.And I don't support that."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"I heard good things about this movie. I finally got around to watching it, and when it was over I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The story is typical, and the characters are nothing fantastic. Rachel McAdams plays a particularly unlikeable character, a spoiled tart/southern bell. Ryan Gosling is just a lowly pauper child, who falls for this twit for reasons unknown. His character did not serve his acting skills any justice. The story line brings nothing new to the genre of romance. Also, the ending is beyond far fetched. Id even go to say it insults the life of anyone who has ever had Alzheimers."
4,A good make-up movie (and tearjerker),"Following a long, hard day at work, caught ""Notebook"" - what is supposedly this year's most romantic, schmaltzy movie - in a bid to lighten up. Walked out of the movie inspired by the wondrous portrayal of selfless love, ready to take on the good and bad that life entails in a stride.The opening scene of a man rowing serenely in a lake against the backdrop of a magnificent setting sun is set to take one's breath away. Both the young and older cast was superb, not least the location shoots which were stunningly beautiful. Check out its divine soundtrack too."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"The Notebook is by far the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched it 4 times in one day and cried everytime! It is the best love story I have ever seen. I will be buying the book very soon so that I can picture the way I want the characters to look.This movie is not only good to watch with your significant other, but you can watch it with your grandmother, mother, or your [...]little sister!!! I highly recomend purchasing this DVD. You will not only get the entertainment of watching it, but you will get a lifetime of entertainment because the story seems to stick with you in your heart! Enjoy"
2,"""The Notebook"" is my all time favorite Book!","I have read ""The Notebook"" three times now. After I read it and fell in love with the story; I bought the book for a friend. She then became hooked on Nick Sparks work. I went to see the movie in the Theater and at the end of the movie was left feeling disappointed. I remembered things from the book that should not have been left out of the movie. And a few things were added to the story that should not have been. The fighting and making out for instance was not in the book and should have been left out of the movie! After watching the movie I reread the book to see how my memory was of the book. I was even more upset after i finished reading. The book really is so much better. A beautiful love story that I will stick to reading over. I will not watch this movie again!"
5,Greatest Love Story Ever,"The movie is so sweet and romantic, it truly does justice to the amazing novel. The love scene is a little much for the kids, but other than that the movie is very clean, which makes it more enjoyable."
4,Worth the hype,"ok even for a guy, I thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth, but to my amazement I thought is was a great story and lived up to all that I have reviewed. I would suggest the movie to all."
5,Most moving movie I have seen,"The notebook is a touching fantastic movie about a love that I find truelly incredible. I have watched it several times and I cry each and every single time. The actors are really good, I am a big fan.A movie to see, unlike any love storie you have seen or heard about!"
3,Notes on 'The Notebook',"I never really bought into the Harlequin Romance love story between simple country boy Ryan Gosling and hot rich babe Rachel McAdams. His totally psycho opening move of climbing up a Ferris Wheel and threatening suicide in order to coerce a date from this babe, who didn't know him from Gomer Pyle, was laughable. Most babes would've told him to go ahead and jump -- or even helped pry his psycho fingers from the bar. Thus, the beginning of the love story is simply unbelievable. As it yet somehow progresses, it's also totally overblown and far too animated. However, the movie is very nicely filmed and does manage, in spite of its chick flick roots, to evoke some genuine emotion -- mostly from the James Garner-Gena Rowlands end of things. I watched this with my 20 year old daughter, who loved it, while I was mostly just shaking my head and smiling to myself."
5,The Notebook,The Notebook is one of my favorite movies received in good condition on time quality very good i am very pleased with is item
1,A Summer Fling or Is It,"Do you ever wonder if a summer fling will ever last? Well the Notebook gives you hope and desire to persue what you thought wouldn't. This film shows a man's love for a woman can succeed everything. Noah and Ali's love will live on forever in the hearts of the people. I urge you to take your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife to see this romantic movie. I guarentee that people of all ages will love this film."
1,too offensive and too long,"The movie shows way too much of two that fall in love and is very offensive by showing two scenes of total nudity and engaging in 'love' before marriage. After about 10 minutes you get the message that they are in love and have tension, but the movie continues the same theme for an hour or more. I will NOT give away the ending which is very powerful except that my experience with an Alzheimer friend was very much different and very much more painful and depressing. The ending in the movie happens to about two percent of those whose lives are hurt by the disease. It IS one of the most horrible and painful sicknesses to loved ones than any other disease.May I add that if we diverted the money to AIDS which is 95% preventable and placed it in research for an Alzheimer cure/vaccine, which is 100% non-preventable and which afflicts the innocent, both victims and families, there would be a better chance of reducing or eliminating the non-discriminating disease."
1,This movie ruins marriages,"This movie is extremely detrimental to the institution of marriage in the United States:Jessica Simpson: 'Notebook' spurred divorceCNN website, February 5, 2007""She made that decision, she says, after watching the 2004 romance ""The Notebook"" on a plane ride home to Texas. ""I just figured out the statement,"" she says of the movie, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as star-crossed lovers. ""It was about that moment of desperation. I needed to breathe."""""
5,One of the best Romance Movies Ever!,For those who still think true love is possible to find.. even when you struggle through out the years to get to the right person. This movie touches the simplicity and nature of love and what it means being a couple.
4,I bought this as a gift.,"More or less; if she's satified with it, then I am too. Because it's one of her favorite movies, I know it will be good."
5,a really heartwarming movie,"I really loved the movie, ""The Notebook"" when I saw it in theatres and love it on dvd too. It's a really beautiful film. It's romantic and really heartwarming and well worth seeing. It's a really well acted and well done story. It's one of those rare gem of a films that can become a classic and really meaningful. I'd give it a ten if I could."
1,Terrible copy,"Wasn't a full version of the movie, alot of parts were cut out, and it was a terrible copy. Even though it was inexpensive it's not right that I had to pay for the shipping to return it. I should have been reimbursed for that as well."
4,Nice story,Its refreshing to see a movie like this for a change. I almost felt that hollywood could not make a movie that was not lewd and crude anymore. Its a love story thats you will enjoy.
5,Favorite,the dvd was in great condition. its a great movie and i enjoyed it very much. arrived quickly also. thank you so much.
3,The notebook,"The movie was good. But when I got the box, it was torn up and the case of the DVD was messed up and had been cut."
4,Very Sappy but Appealing,"The Notebook is...sappy, unrealistic, romantic and everybody wants to say ""ugh, it's SO cheesy!"" but everybody ends up liking it even though it IS very very sappy. It's a guilty pleasure but they make this movie in a way that gets you into it and feeling not so bad about liking it. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this film (Rachel is absolutely gorgeous). They DID win best kiss at the MTV movie awards. Haha. It's a great romantic film to watch with your boyfriend/girlfriend os bunch of girlfriends. Guys will say ""oh I was dragged to see it with my girlfriend"" but secretly they will like it (hah). Don't watch it with people who will be like ""this is SO unrealistic!"" the entire time. It really ruins it because you KNOW it won't be realistic. It's just the ""most romantic movie"" ever!"
2,About 2 1/2 stars...........and that 's being nice.,"Though there are a few things and/or songs I think are ok, this album is well below average. Some guitar work is ok most of it you have heard many times before. The album starts off decent enough but goes down hill about half way through. Listen to it a couple of times and it gets worse. Kasier von Loopy has an ok voice but is limited to 2 songs and the latter really sucks. If you are into the industrial/metal thing already this is really not for you. If you're new to the genre,well..........this is not for you either. There are plenty of other groups to sink your teeth into.........go researching!"
5,"Not quite ""uber alles"" but close enough","Not quite ""uber alles"" but pretty close......Vas is as upfront and brutal with her lyrical approach as before...but the music seems slightly more campy this time....but that's not a bad thing neccessarily....the music is still uber catchy and grabs you pretty much the whole way through....a good industrial metal album none the less....best songs are Kaiser Von Shizer, Burning Bush, and We Shall Purify....good cd won't dissapoint fans of metal or of industrial music."
2,What happened?!?!,"I will be brief with this. Everything that made HuG what they were, is lacking on this album. There is very little sampling on this album compared to past efforts from Hug and this album has a much more ""raw"" feel to it. They seem to be moving in a different direction as a band, that direction leads to redundant metal mediocrity."
2,its not Uber Alles,"I found this to be lacking compared to Uber Alles. If you are a big fan of the band you might find it more interesting, if you think Uber Alles was awesome and wanna buy this one I would suggest saving your money for a ticket to their live show, its worth it.This album lacks the intensity/urgency that they brought with Uber Alles."
5,DON'T LEAVE THE DOCK WITHOUT THIS BOOK!,You should not be out on the water without this book! It is the most important safety item you can own. Everything you need to know about safe boating is here. And it is WATERPROOF TOO! You don't have to worry about getting it wet which makes it perfect on our 20 foot sailboat. I love the flip chart format. It makes finding the info you need a snap. This is a must have on every boat. Its the perfect gift for your husband!
1,Monotone Writing Makes For Boring Read,"I have read other books by Clifford Linedecker and have none of them to be as boring and tedious as this one. I love true crime but found myself skimming many pages of this book because the information was completely useless or repitious.The basis for an interesting story was here, but the author just didn't make it happen. It appears that, while mentioning it somewhat, Linedecker wanted us to view Roger Paulson (the victim) as a truly manipulated, prime citizen type of guy as his murderer, Lisa Miller Rohn, as skilled manipulator, lying, thieving woman who would do anything to save herself. Unfortunately, although mentioned only in passing, I was able to see that Paulson, with his claims of military service and exhibition of a purple heart (all lies), that the old saying sticks; that is, ""Birds of a feather flock together.""It would have made the reading more interesting if Linedecker had played on ALL the information."
2,Mistress on his trems...,"Luke McRae's wants to have sex with Katrin Sigurdson for one night and she refuses to do so. Luke kept on pestering her, following her and asking questions about her around the village she was living in. Katrin finally did give in but he rejected her love.I felt Luke was dangerous; he behaved like a little boy who wants to have everything without the responsibilities. He sulks, Stalks, loses his temper, domineering, possessive, unstable, combative, gets angry quickly and everything else. I can keep on and on. I know this book was printed in 2003 but the writing felt like it written between 20 to 30 years ago. I didn't enjoy this book at all. What a disappointment. I give it 1.5 stars."
2,Tired and uninspiring - definitely not one of Stock-Aitken's best,"Despite songwriting and backing musical support by Mike Stock and Matt Aitken (Pete Waterman was no longer part of the trio by now), this album falls far short of the great albums of the eighties that the trio was known for. For starters, Nicki French's singing ability is average at best, and her limp, lifeless remake of ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart,"" would probably make Bonnie Tyler laugh. The beats and melodies are also pretty tired all around, and even if this album were to be looked at simply from the perspective of ""pretty face to sing mindless dreck,"" it fails there because Nicki French isn't even particularly cute (at least I don't think so). ""Something About You,"" has a decent beat and is probably the catchiest and best song on the album, however, it's still nothing really special, and some purists may be soured by the fact that it was originally a Carpenters song."
2,Not my thing,"Mr. Dew, if you are looking for this on CD, I have a copy which I don't want, and will sell to you at regular used CD cost. I only listened a couple of times. I think she has a fantastic voice, but the songs are lacking in originality, which is one of the main points I look for in music."
4,This is Vampire Hunting Music...,"I first heard Nicki's version of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" while one a road trip with a buddy back in 1995. ""Something about you"" was getting some air play then, too. We would drive through some damn dangerous neighborhoods doing damn dumb things, and had a blast listening to this as our soundtrack. We coined her songs ""Vampire Hunting Music"" (for reasons too weird to go into here).Since then, I've been using the CD as my workout music. It's got a great beat and the songs are paced to keep me moving, then allow a little slowdown, and then another pick up for the next move.I agree that the Carpenters cover, ""For all we know,"" is a bit weak. I'm also a MAJOR fan of Bonnie Tyler (""It's a Heartache"" was one of the first 45s I ever purchased -- yup, I'm old), but she wasn't a goddess! It is hardly blasphemy to cover ""Total Eclipse of the Heart."" Yeeesh. Even Meat Loaf does a passable cover. So it's different -- get over it!"
4,Solid strategy for the verbal section,I have been a GMAT tutor to ESL test takers for over 6 years and I have to say that the PR strategies are by far the most useful for students who don't speak English as their first language and need to focus their efforts on the score raising essentials. IMHO the main weakness of this book is its lack of isolated concept drills to drive home each strategy.Howard Spencer-EES Executive English Solutions Chile
2,"Verbal Workout for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate Test Prep)","Not so useful, the verbal section is much better covered in Cracking the GMAT with DVD, 2007 Edition (Graduate Test Prep).If you are reffering to 2007 Edition you don't need to buy the verbal Workout book."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"After going through the verbal workout and comparing it with Kaplan, the verbal book is a complete waste of time and money. The book spends too much time on how to ""game"" the test instead of teaching you the basic building blocks and strategies to solve the questions. The practice questions hardly resemble what GMAT verbal questions are. In many cases, the explanations confused me more. The only bright side is that the book has an extensive list of logic phrases and grammar which might be helpful if you don't them."
3,"Verbal Workout for the GMAT, 2nd Edition (Graduate Test Prep)",I have not had a chance to complete the book. But so far its good
2,Rich Versus Poor Rehash,Superficial drama of a teen and mom having to move away to grandma's leaky shack. Of course the 1st day of school she meets a rich lonely boy whose parents hide deep problems of their own. How do scripts like this get made? There's just nothing on the page that could be that good no matter who acted it.
5,How Did He Do That!?,"This is such a cool CD. Yuval Ron combines instruments from all over the world with sounds from everyday objects. I think my favorite track is, ""Zerox Meditation,"" where he actually recorded a Zerox machine and made it into a percussive instrument throughout the piece. Really neat stuff. This will make you look at your household appliances in a whole new way."
1,Makes My Dog Puke,"I purchased this product in hopes that it would help my dog's hips and joints. I've given it to her a total of three times and she puked it back up twice. Needless to say, I'm not going to keep giving it to her if it makes her throw up, so it was a waste of money for me and no help to her."
1,"My border collie hates em, and won't eat em in anything","They appear to be very good chemically, and thats why I ordered em, but Muffy won't eat em in ice cream, and that must mean they taste bad to her."
3,Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Tabs,"The tabs seem to work, but I must coax my dog to take them. I assume they must taste awful. I've tried other tabs that were flavored and had no problems getting my dog to take them. Good price."
5,great product,"my dog loves these and they have helped her a lot- no prior injuries, but she is a large breed dog (prone to hip dysplasia) was at 80# when she started using them. acts like puppy :)"
1,did not like,"Unfortunetely, my pug did not like them at all. Wish I hadn't bought them. I went back to what i was buying for her."
3,Good...Not Great,"Overall, I think my dog is responding to the supplement. I would give the product 4 stars if I could get me dog to eat the pills without peanut butter."
2,Doesn't seem to be working yet,"We have been giving our old golden retriever this product for well over a month and I am not seeing any improvement in his condition. He is still having great difficulty getting up, climbing stairs and moving around. He also will not simply chew up this chewable tablet. We need to hide it under peanut butter on a spoon to even get him to take his daily dose. The dog did as well when I gave him one baby aspirin a day instead."
5,Just like puppies!,"Our ten-year old golden retriever and collie were starting to get stiff. Even though they are walked in the forest for miles every morning and evening, just as we are, the joints start to ""go."" An article in Bark magazine says glucosamine is proved to work for humans and animals. The product from the pet store was liquid and very messy, so we read the reviews here and decided to try it. Sure enough, both dogs are playing again, senior citizens acting like puppies. They still lag on the walks they once loved, but I understand the glucosamine needs to build up gradually. The golden is overweight, so that too must be addressed: too much weight on joints really shortens the lifespan of dogs. We will continue to use this product."
3,This product works... when eaten!,"This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down. However, after a few weeks on this product, she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!! Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her. I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day. Good thing I bought the small bottle! Once its done (10 more to go!), I'm switching to something more palatable."
5,NIKKI CAN MOVE AGAIN!!!,"Nikki is a 13-year-old yellow lab. About a year ago she got to were she could not move hardly at all. I started her on these supplements and we noticed a difference in one week with her movements. By the end of 3-4 weeks she was actually chasing a ball again! It has now been a year - she bounces, hops and plays like one of the other dogs again. We give her the medicine once a day and she gobbles them up with no problems."
5,Excellent Product,"I have a 14 year old Lab that was limping badly from arthritis in her shoulder. We started giving her this product twice a day and guess, she doesn't limp any more. It has greatly improved her quality of life"
5,Wonderful!,My dogs just love these and they work wonderful. I really should use the number 3 but I have used this product for so long I hate to change. I have two dogs..ages 16 and 11. I credit this product for keeping them active.
3,Expected more...,"Mangio Troppa Cioccolata was my favorite album. I liked about half of Senza Ali. Her vocal talent still seems to be escalating, but I expected more music-wise since Herbie Hancock helped on this album."
3,very 'odd' and thank goodness it was a short book,This novel was nothing like Hinton's previous books; the writing was good but really didn't feel like a novel - more like a long essay on one woman's discovery of her husband's secret.Jean Witherspoon's husband dies and she comes to deal with the secret and her life without her husband. The story is one big narrative and I was glad when it was finished.I have so enjoyed Hinton's other books ~ this was a different turn for the author - more of a ramble to me.
2,Poor quality solar panels and overall quality,These were ordered as replacement for the plastic ones that were falling apart in my backyard.Pros:. Relatively good price. They look niceCons:. Poor quality control. 2 out of 6 were completely dead upon initial assembly and a third one went dead after the first week; I had to purchase new rechargeable batteries to get them to work again.. I broke the stem from one of them when I was staking it to the ground. The outside is made of steel but the connections are still made of cheap plastic.. The lights stay on only for 2 hours after dark. The problem appears to be the solar panels not charging enough since this also happens with the ones with new batteries.
4,Nice looking-cheap batteries included,"For the price, these are about the best you can get. Attractive and fairly solid. The only problem I experienced were the cheap'Made in China' batteries which, when fully charged lasted about 2 hours. I purchased 'Made in America' solar batteries and now the lights last me a minimum of 8 hours.All said, a good purchase."
5,solor lights,They are beautiful. They look wonderful in my new landscaped yard. It was very easy to order from amazon and would do it again. Thank YOu
3,awareness...,"i bought this item and i was very excited to get it in the mil. it looks almost exactly like th one in the movie and it's fairly heavy. although, when i got it out of the package, the piece of metal you turn to lock the needle in place broke immediately, so just be aware. they want to make money and might not have the best quality.... either that or i just got the bad one.... but i can still wear it not worry about loosing it. it looks very nice with any cloak!"
5,cook book,"I have a large cooking library, so pick and choose before adding another book. This is a great seasonal addition."
4,Read it again...,"From the get go, the images are fresh-even in the translation-and the stories, although sometimes rather twisted, profoundly real. Tran Vu's stories are graphic and occasionally shocking, but his narrative flows through the book from the first to the last page and I found it quite difficult not to devour this book. First book I have read in a long time that actually made an impression on me."
2,Gone the way of fantasy writers....,"As others have stated i'm a long time RA Salvatore fan and enjoy reading and on occasion re-reading his books. This book however just drags on. Meeting Kane. and King Gareth's crew was good, but went no where. Mustering for the big battle scene sounded great, then died off. This book sounded to me like he was forced into throwing something together intime for the pre-holiday season. Another small issue i had with this book was the graphic adult content. I know personally several youngsters who have loved reading Salvatore books. Not sure this new one they've been ranting about is good for them. Just my 2 cents."
1,I expect more,"Am I the only one who notices that ""Gareth Dragonsbane"" and the whole ""Bloodstone"" thing was ripped straight out of an old D&D module (Bloodstone Wars, I believe). Is Wizards giving license for their authors to use old material and pass it off as their own? I expect more from the author who pounded out the Icewind Dale Trilogy and the Dark Elf Trilogy. (I gave it a 1/5 only because it wouldn't let me give it a 0)."
3,What was the point?,"Road of the Patriarch (Forgotten Realms: The Sellswords, Book 3)BOOK OVER ALL: C-THE SERIES: B-Story: C-, Prose: C-, Dialogue: C, Romance: C, Action: C+, Plot: C-.This was a relatively good series, but this book was less than average, slow and uninteresting with too much attitude from its characters, that seemed thin, fake, and very forced. The ending was also quite weak and anti climatic. R.A. Salvatore usually does better than this disappointing and tired work.PROS:Artemis Entreri relationship with CalihyeCONS:Boring plot, little action, insipid and shallow dialogue, rambling story line, uninteresting characters."
3,Listened to on MP3,I listen to audio only daily. So when a story is great I can't stop listening when a story have dull bits I tend to day dream and comeback when when it improves.I really strugged through nearly all of this story on audio.The narrator was absolutely brilliant and I thought a few times how his different voices for different characters were mind blowing. But a great narrator can't improve an average story.Some parts of this story my eyes flew open in disbelief and i was gripped. Then it was so slow again I daydreamed.I have loved other Fantasy books and have put them in my top 10 ever listened to audios. So its not that.I will give this story a 3 star maybe more than it deserves because of the wonderful narrator. I do love magical themes. The whole concept was great just something wrong in the telling.Hey try it and see what you think.
5,One of the best in the series,"All I have to say is I really love the villans/evil characters that spawned off of the Drizzt storyline. This book is one of my favorite in the series because it is all about my two favorite characters Artemis and Jarlaxle. These guys are no nonsense, at least Artemis is, and will get the job done by any means necessary. This book was totally awesome and I really cant wait for Salvatore to continue where this book ended, because these guys are great characters. I'm also patiently waiting for Artemis to find out that Drizzt is still alive. Can't wait to see that reaction! This book is truly one of Salvatore best."
4,Salvatore keeps the sword a swinging,"Another good book in the Forgotten Realms series featuring characters found in the Drizzt books. I like how the author has continued to develop Artemis, although there are times I just want to slap the hell out of the character. One gets the feeling that Artemis feels trapped within a world moving faster and faster. It is nice, however, to note the human side of this assassin."
5,Road of the Patriarch,Once again anther excellent book bu Salvadore. Love his work and find that once started can't put it down. A great read
4,Up and Down,"A wonderful journey, of the calibre expected from such an author. However, the ending I felt could have been a lot better, its probably the main complaint that I have with this book. Great fights, interesting characters and a plot line that will keep you interested, even if it is a little predictable in places."
3,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of RA Salvatore for many years now, and I've read all of his Forgotten Realms novels. Usually, his work is fabulous, but this book felt unnatural. The storyline didn't flow like it usually did, and all in all, the content disappointed me immensely. The conclusion was clumsy, and the exposition too hastily set. Salvatore should have introduced the characters gradually as he had done in his other books.If you've read the first two books in this trilogy, then you should read this one too, but this book definitely does not stand on its own."
3,Good but not Great,"After reading the likes of the Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, Halflings Gem, Homeland, Exile, Soujourne, etc, I've come to expect great works from R.A. Salvatore. I haven't been ""blown away"" with his Thousand Orcs trilogy, or the Sellswords trilogy. I liked the Road of the Patriarch the least out of this Trilogy for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, I feel that there is a lack of a solid plot in this story. It seems that Entreri and Jarlaxle just jump from one place and adventure to the next place and adventure. What were they trying to accomplish? On the positive side, there was a lot of great fights and action, and a lot of new enigmatic characters. I especially liked Kane and the other members of the gang that brought the Bloodstone Lands together. I would like to read their story, and how they defeated the witch-king. Not sure if Wizards has a book out on that. Anyway, if you like Salvatore, I doubt you will be disappointed with this one."
4,"Road of the Patriarch (Forgotten Realms: The Sellswords, Book 3)","I have read all of Salvatore's books involving Drizzit, Jarlaxle, and Entreri. This book was no disapointment, in my opinion, as were none of the others before it. Salvatore keeps true to his nature in describing battles, and giving them detail a plenty for you to imagine them as they take place. The humor in this gave me regular laughs as well. I highly suggest those fans of this series to read this piece, and those who havn't read the series, to start =)"
4,Three songs make this CD,"Three songs and the instrumental backup, especially bass guitar and drums, make this CD. They are: A Mezza Via, Un'Altra Te, and Silver e Missie. Listen carefully to the guitar and drums in these songs and also in the very first track. You'll enjoy them as much as Eros' performance. I would only have given it a 3.5-rating if it weren't for these selections."
3,GOOD BUT NOT HER GREATEST,"Her books are all definitely spine tingling and thrilling, but compared to the two other books I've read, Undone and Fractured (which I HIGHLY recommend), this book was not as exciting, thrilling, and spine tingling as I expected. It's still a great book but not her best."
4,Love the Grant Co Series,"This is yet another great read from Karin Slaughter. The Grant Co series never disappoints. I do recommend reading the books that preceed this one. But, it is a good book."
1,Dull and dragging.,"Way too much backstory about unlikeable people. There is not one character that rings true. Everyone seemed to have a chip on their shoulder which made them very hard to care what happens to them It is also predictable. I knew who the killer was as soon as the character was introduced. He might as well have worn a sign, "" I am creepy"". I finished it but will not buy any more books by this author."
2,Always looking for a good mystery writer,"This is the first of Karin Slaughter's books that I have read and am not sure if I will read anymore. Most of the characters were irritating, especially Lena, who seems so conflicted with her personal life that she can't focus on her job. Not having read the earlier books in what seems to be a series, a lot of the drama was lost on me. Sounds like Jeffrey cheated on his wife, wife's mother cheated on her husband, wife may or may not be natural daughter of wacko cult patriarch who is now in a wheelchair, men routinely beat and terrorize their wives and daughters, women are victims in general -- all way too much for me. I'm back to P.D. James and Dorothy Sayers!"
4,I liked this one!,"I found this engrossing and liked the way he story went along. As far as the mystery went I believe my suspicions towards the middle were correct, just did not know the details. But it did not deter me from finishing to find out exactly what was going go. Things did seem a bit far fetched at times, but it's fiction people.I go with the flow as long as I'm interested. And great news came at the end - finally."
4,Faithless,It was a good read. Karin Slaughter really does a good job of mixing in all the players. She knows how to get you hooked were you can't stop reading.
4,Twist and turns,She does it again with the twist and turns to keep you guessing. Many key point that also answer question on the Will Trent series.
5,Love her books,Loved it love all of Slaughter books. Just started reading her this year - my sister recommended her so glad she did
2,Long and drawn out,"This book started off really well, just like a lot of her previous books have. Problem with this one is that after the first 50 pages or so, things seemed to veer off on another direction and the book took on a whole different story. There were so many characters in this book and, in my opinion, half of them didn't need to be there. This book could have been 200 pages, not 400. I was just really disappointed with the story and the let down ending. I don't think I'll be continuing with this author."
2,So silly,"I'm new to this type of book but the first I read was Lee Child's ""The Hard Way"" featuring his loner hero Jack Reacher and after that this book was an incredible let down. Implausible plotting and idiot characters was my main problem. This is set in rural Georgia and I didn't buy it. Seriously- one of the main protaganists has been raped by a jesus freak, her twin sister was killed and she was being abused by her ex-skinhead boyfriend and she had an abortion. She's also a police detective. Yeah- dopey."
3,Faithless by Karin Slaughter,I have read all of the books written by Karin Slaughter and I have enjoyed each and every one. Faithless was not what I expected and did not have as much action or suspense as her other books. I will continue to be a fan of Karin Slaughter but I hope she writes a better book next time
3,Interesting read,"I won't go into the detail of the book, as so many others already have. The book is good enough to read all the way through, although it does get confusing with it's cult like church and characters that get lost in the shuffle."
1,Skip This One!,Geesh! This should have been entitled Family angst with a small dose of murder on the side. Page after page I kept waiting for something to happen while the two main characters went on and on and on with their certifiable relationship. Found myself skipping pages as the characters in each long-drawn-out-scene beat a subject to death. Mid way through I was wishing all the characters had been buried in a box and left there.
1,burns up,"OK! YOU DIDNT LIKE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF BAD WORDS??? HERE! THESE NEON PLATE FRAMES ARE GARBAGE??? THE TRANSFORMER SHORTS AND BLOWS FUSES AND BURNS WIRES? THEY ARE NO GOOD! DONT BUY THEM THEY ONLY LAST A FEW MONTHS AND THEN YOU GET TO PAY AN ELECTRICIAN TO FIND THE PROBLEM WHEN YOUR OTHER LIGHTS DONT WORK BECAUSE WHEN THE TRANSFORMER IN THESES SHORTS OUT! AND THEY WILL! YOU FIND THE FUSE AND CHECK FOR BURNT WIRING???:-)MY AVALANCHE IS IN THE SHOP AS I WRITE THIS GETTING IT REMOVED AND FUSES REPLACED! AND BURNT WIRES! SO GO AHEAD BUY ONE! YOU ""WILL"" BE SORRY! GO LEDS :-)"
2,Bad Choice on Copyright Protection,"I love the music and Manny Lehman's CD -- but am a bit annoyed at how the copywright protection impacts my freedom to listen to it. It won't work in my Jeep's CD player -- skips to track 11 and then have to pry it out of player. And, I can't rip tracks to my iPod. So, whoopie! I can listen to it on my one CD player at home. I wouldn't have bothered had I know about the limitations on listening to the CD."
2,"Great music, but very limited use","The Copyright protection on this CD prevented me from putting it on my primary music source - an MP3 player. It will not play in my computer either......too bad, the songs are great"
1,CD CONTAINS COPY PROTECTION,"This CD contains copy protection, so it will not play on computers. Do you not buy this CD if you plan to make a backup copy or transport the songs to a portable MP3 player like an iPod."
1,ZInged by Copy Protection,"I only listen to Techno/Dance via my iPod while working out at the gym. This disc has copy protection on it that prevents you from turning it in to MP3s and then playing it on an iPod...so this disc is useless. I love Manny Lehman's music--he's my favorite DJ--but do not like his ""anti-piracy"" tactics, so I guess this is the last albumn of his I will buy.....Unless you only listen to you music via 20-year old technology I would suggest passing on this disc."
1,Wish I Could Have Heard This CD,"I just bought this CD today, took it back to the office, put it in my laptop, and then immediately returned it to the store. As everyone else has pointed out, the encryption prevents you from listening to the CD in anything but the most standard of equipment (stereos, etc.). No wonder record companies are losing money. Too bad - I like Manny Lehman. Maybe he'll find a new record company that understands it's now the 21st century."
4,Floored,Look I love this CD it rocks. However I will not buy any CD that is copy protected. Face it CD - D.J producers your product has serious flaws in the longlivity department. The more you play it .... the more damage ... That is why we burn it. I will be seriously pissed if I spend hard earned dollars on a CD and I find that I cannot prolong its life by copy. Shame on you **greedy artist ... Have a little faith that dance music lovers will do the right thing.
5,Excellent Photo History,"Having just moved to the area, it's nice to have a little history lesson. The photos are incredible. Things have changed in our neighborhood. Anyone native of DC will love this book and any from the IMAGES of AMERICA series."
5,Most Used Cookbook,"This cookbook is a must have, in my opinion. It is in use more than any other from my large collection. Recipes are easy and everything we have tried tastes wonderful. I am using my second edition as my daughter wanted my original."
2,"good written descriptions of signs, bad selection of words","This book has one big thing going for it, and that is, for the words that they do have, they give excellent written descriptions of the hand motions (which are usually impossible to decipher from the drawings). But about 95% of the time that I pick it up to look up a word, it doesn't have it. Here are some words it doesn't have: over, ladder, fix (but it has fax), light (but it has lesbian), cut, knife - these words seem pretty basic to me.The section that teaches you whole phrases is good only for laughing. It has the most useless, ridiculous phrases - but let me give you some examples: ""Those kids have already become snobs."" ""We want to see you, but not until my daughter leaves."" ""You must inform the family about our recent marriage."" ""I have a few cats under the house.""I do not recommend this book."
3,American Sign Language,"This was the first book I purchased when I discovered that I would be assisting in teaching my 2 year old daughter sign language as her primary form of communication. I loved the fact that this book is in a dictionary-type form where I can quickly search for a word. But this book is really lacking in ""common"" words used to describe everyday things used by a 2 year old child. ""Essential ASL"" is a great book to be used for reference when needing to quickly look up a word that you may have forgotten how to sign; but is not, in my opinion, the best book to purchase if you are just beginning to learn sign language."
5,Heart Sense is heart-felt wisdom!,"I have just finished reading and doing several of the exercises in Dr. Reeves' wonderful book. She is bold, bone-honest and completely compassionate. What a joy! While her book seems to me to be mostly from the perspective of wise simplicity, she offers the reader enough data/facts/hard evidence and sound psychological theory to ground her method and her message.Which is, if I understand correctly --- you have a soul and if you listen to your heart, you can live from it and toward it and within it. That's what I want for my life. Dr. Reeves offers an exemplary examination of what that would look like and suggestions for how to do it. If you are also interested in a heart-centered way of living, read her book."
4,Ethereal and soul-stirring,This music recreates the emotion and drama of the movie very well. It brings to life some very real and powerful emotions through the artful gift of music.
1,"Could not read, so boring and cliche","This book gave me the rare experience of not finishing a book. In fact it was so bad, I barely started before abandoning it. Don't make the mistake of judging Charles Grant novels by their cool cover art. I've read two good book by this author (Carousel and Dialing the Wind), which makes this such an oddity to me."
3,Thought it was thicker,"i have some polypropylene long underwear - top and bottom, and they are about 1/8 inch thick, and they are the warmest i have ever owned or worn. this is not the same. i bought it for my girlfriend, who is always freezing, and while this is a nice union suit - i wanted the 1/8-inch-super-thick-can't-wear-it-while-the-sun-is-shining-or-you'll-roast. they call it 'winter weight,' but it's of a normal thickness for a union suit."
5,UNION SUIT FOR SKIING,Just used the suit in VAIL for a week of skiing. Worked perfectly ! Wicked away moisture and was warm a plenty.The most useful point was the staying in position when going through bumps and not having underware sliding into ski pants down to your knees.Shoulder support eliminates the falling underware problem!
2,A little disappointed,"The union suit arrived in a timely manner, but the suit is NOT ""winter weight"". It is very light. The buttons are very small and the button holes are a bit too large, so it unbuttons itself just about as fast as you button it up. For what this suit cost, it should be better made and thicker material. Look elsewhere and save yourself the disappointment."
3,unionsuit,Unionsuit material feels a bit scratchy like wool; not as comfortable as our other unionsuits.
1,doesn't work,"This doesn't remove basic nail polish let alone anything ""advanced"" like glitter polish. I can't imagine trying to remove acrylics with this! 0 stars"
1,Beyond Bad,"Sometimes a bad movie can be kind of good. This one is an amateur production that is beyond bad. It is stupid, annoying and I want my 1.99 back."
1,Junk.,"They do not work. We tried these in 2 different sizes, with children and adults of varying weights. The only thing anti-gravity about them is that they make you taller. A huge Christmas disappointment."
2,Lovely toe ring but too big,"This is a nice toe ring, but even though I have size 10-11 feet, it is too big and slips round, so the 'knot' is underneath, and if you go swimming with it on it will always come off - so not ideal for wearing and useage."
5,Treasured Songs from a Contemporary Sufi,Words can not describe this ecstatic outpouring of mystical songs from one whose heart has truly merged with the Divine. These are songs that came after great meditation and a full understanding of the relationship of man to God and God to man.
5,T-Fal 6.4-Quart Speedy-Chef Express Stainless-Steel Pressure Cooker,The cooker is very good. I like it.
3,SS Pressure Cooker,"This item was a gift to a friend wedding anniversary. It came in its original box. The box was damaged but the pot looked OK. Since I didn't have enough time to exchange for a different one , I put the pot in a nice box and wrapped it up. I hope it would work fine."
5,EXCELLENT PRESSURE COOKER FOR GOOD PRICE!!!,I bought one to my house and since arrived i washed and used!! and works excellent is fast and the timer is good idea!!the presentation is beautiful easy to open and close just press the top-botton for me is easy to clean-up i use a lot this pressure cooker and still looks like new because i do not put it in the dishwasher i wash by hand when is cool never i like put in my sink hot pots in contact with cool water for this reason change the color with spots.After i bought 3 more on sale$39.99 as gifts!!
3,Too High Tech - Keep It Simple,"My wife does not like high tech gadgets. There are enough features on a pressure cooker to figure out without having to worry about an electronic timer. I wound up buying another pressure cooker with a more simplistic design, and hopefully it will do a better job cooking food."
4,Good cooker,Just got it in mail yesterday. I already start using this cooker this morning. Cooked GAVAR and TOOR DAAL in 5 min. Works great!!!!!
4,Good product at reasonable price,Very nice look. Easy to use. But you have to release pressure very carefully.
3,Meh,"If you're a perfectionist you might want to find some other glow-in-the-dark paint or mix your own. This stuff comes out thick and cake-y and will be very difficult to lay evenly without a bunch of sanding.Also this is only a 7oz. can. The instructions say it should cover 10-12 sqaure feet, but honestly it looked to me like one can was good for maybe 3, if you want even coverage. Maybe buy one more can than you think you need.The unilluminated color as the others have said is a pale yellow."
1,This stuff is worthless,This doesn't even deserve 1 starWorthless product. If you are looking for a consumer paint that glows in the dark. This ain't it. I painted a white handtruck with this paint and let it sit in the sunlight all day. I'm in Cali 88 degrees bright and sunny. Looked out my window when it got dark and I couldn't see the handtruck. Total waste of money
2,It will glow...mostly.,"Application: It sprays out thick and quickly so keep at least a foot away and move quickly. It naturally has a coarse texture so be ready to sand with 600 grit between coatings if you want it smooth. The good news is that it is sandable in 5 minutes. With several layers, the color (on a white backgroud) is best described as Dijon Mustard.Glowing: It works as well as I had expected, but not as well as I'd hoped for. I used it for trim on my motorcycle and left it out all day in the sun. About an hour after sunset, I had to cup my hands around it to see a dull blue glow. But if I take samples directly out of the light and into the hallway or bathroom, it performs well enough.Overall: I have a dull yellow racing stripe."
3,pricey sliding shower door bottom,"It worked as expected, but it is pricey. Too bad that it was no longer sold at the local hardware stores like Home Depot, Lowe's or OSH. I bought it one time at Home Depot (about 3 years ago) and it costs just a fraction of what I have to pay now. I do not like this rip-off fact at all! They should be a lot cheaper for consumers (at least 1/3 of the current price), it should be treated like the other similar types of sliding accessories."
4,"Required to Keep the Door on Older Glass Shower Doors, now hard to find!","This tiny plastic piece had broken on an old bathroom shower sliding glass door. It is only a small piece of plastic that is used daily when you open and close the shower, it held up very well in the main bathroom. I found it easy to replace, anyone can DIY and fix this!The part is hard to find now. Having it available in this marketplace made my life easier. Once this platic break down you risk having a glass door shatter in your bathroom. DIY EZ."
3,WAY TO PRICEY,I needed it but do feel I got burned on the cost would have been better if they at least came in a Two Pack
5,cajun,"this was a 2 part repair, with the rollers at the top, these bottom guides are easy to remove and just as easy to install. they are a perfect fit to the frame work of the tub surround doors. These guides were so easy that I went ahead and replaced all 4 on this set of doors and have order more for stock as there are so many of this type of door out there."
5,better than $100+ for a new shower door,"The items were as promised, shipping was timely. Price seems high for bits of plastic, but still much less than replacing the door. I found the guide a bit more difficult to install than I expected. The slot for the door bottom to fit in is very narrow and I had to pry a little to get it open enough to slip around the door bottom. I purchased this for a tub door in a rental unit, so far no complaints from the tennant, so it appears to be holding up well. I bought an extra package in case it didn't."
1,Waste of money!!!!,"I purchased this product and had it installed in September of 2012. I do laundry once a week 3 loads. Its been less than 15 washes and they are OUT!!!! I should have listened to those who said it was a piece of crap. I have now to call sears and pay for another genuine part and for someone to come in and install it for me. My agitator is not moving at all but you can hear it skipping on the agitator dogs. It worked very well to start with but only lasted very LITTLE!!!. Customers be aware don't buy this please go straight to sears and order a genuine part and save yourselves the misery. I have a load in the washer right now that is stuck and have to wait for 4 days for the part to get here. If asked, I wish I could get a refund for this defective and cheap part."
5,Pellet Stove Essential,"Works very well for my pellet stove with a 4"" pipe. I recommend this product for easy, and time cutting cleaning. Don't pay someone to clean your stove, order this cleaning kit and a couple of extra rods for long chimneys like I did."
3,Academically of interest -- Needs the right audience!,"Murphy has created a very readable and well documented text that deals with how men instantiate themselves via metaphors passed down through the ages. The metaphors, gathered through personal experience of the author, craft the concept of male bonding while also providing somewhat a ""disservice"" to the male gender. Terms such as stud muffin create a sexual identity that belays the focus from intellect to intercourse in the rawest sense of the word. Other metaphoric phrases and terms create the violence and sports focus which may need changing in the new century we're living in.Murphy does a credible job in his presentation and supporting materials, but the text needs the right audience for classroom use. To the average lay reader, this book is not only enjoyable, but informative and thought-provoking. Well worth the effort and the price of the ticket!"
4,"fabulous music, bad production","Probably my favorite recording by the divine Ms. Stansfield...almost every song a gem..however I must mention that the producer should be shot!...the Bass, as just one example, on ""The Real Thing"" is so over-bloated and distorted that it ruins, for me, some of the listeing pleasure...while this technique adds ""punch"" on a car stereo or boom box, it makes the music almost unlistenable on a decent stereo...LOVE YA LISA! get a decent producer the next time PLEASE!"
5,Her best to date,"Yes, this is Lisa's best cd to date and the other two weren't bad! Good looks and great music...what a combo.."
5,Lisa is wonderful!,"I have heard her on the radio and realized I was missing out not having her music in my collection. She sings beautifully. Her sound is a great blend of R&B and soul. She needs to do more. My fav tracks are The Real Thing, Never Never Gonna Give You Up and Don't Cry For Me."
2,Get to the Point!,"The ""source"" of this narrative hovers continually on the edge of revelation, but never actually says anything about what these so-called sacred teachings involve. What is discussed is only how vital and important these lessons are, alluding to the fact that if mankind doesn't embrace and disseminate these universal principles, it shall suffer the ignominious fate of countless other civilizations which were as intellectually arrogant and morally self-righteous as modern-day humanity. By the time you have read the final paragraph, you are still waiting pensively for the 'moral of the story', but left to fill in the blanks on your own......"
2,Not Much Information,"It was not what I expected at all. It is about a group of UFOs watching what is going on on earth, but not interfering in anyway at all. It has very little good information to help anyone get through the coming crisis or what will happen during the crisis."
3,NOT AS DESCRIBED....NOT 18/10 STAINLESS,"Although it's a beautiful set and the weight is nice, it is NOT 18/10 which means it will rust and lose it's shine through regular usage, especially if you put them in the dishwasher. I don't understand how Amazon can describe it incorrectly in it's ""Product Description"" when it's clearly marked on the box 18/0 which is the lowest grade stainless you can buy. I bought three services for four because it was beautiful and described as 18/10 and couldn't wait to get it only to be shocked to learn the metal quality is not what was described. In the future, I will be very leary about buying through Amazon....they do not get their facts right and it's BUYER BEWARE!!!! Unfortunately, I am returning this, I don't need anymore rusting flatwear...."
4,from a biased reviewer,"Alright let me just say that I am a diehard Gregory fan and I love his music so anything I say about him should be considered thusly.This is a very interesting set played at Brixton, London, England in the 1990's. Gregory is not exactly at his best... his voice and his sound engineers are all pretty weak. But if you love Gregory Isaacs you will love this album. The set includes some classics such as Night Nurse, Private Secretary, and so on. These are cuts not available elsewhere. It is quite an event to be heard but surely not the best introduction to Gregory Isaacs."
5,Old Glory,"I bought this tie over the summer and have already worn it four times. I continue to wear it on every occasion possible. I love the statement it makes to strangers. It's imperative we all remember how lucky we are to be Americans and that most of us would never dream of living anywhere else. This nation, to me, represents liberty and the desire to live the life of my own choosing. What better compliment can one give a country than that? Whenever people ask me why I'm a conservative I tell them, ""There's much about our land I wish to conserve."" There it is! Let us always defend Old Glory and our people."
5,moving photography and personal histories,"this book avoids being sensationalistic and instead shows a very real portrait of what different transgendered lives and experiences look like. the histories of the subjects are particularly moving and personal. i'd recomend this book for anyone interested in gender studies or portrait photography. if, however, you're looking for a sesational and exploitative book of ""trannies"" than you might want to pass this one up."
5,A wonderful resource,"I stumbled on to this book when trying to understand what a friends of a recently diagnosed autistic child were going through. It helped me tremendously...and, it has helped them too as they start this difficult journey. This is a valuable contribution and tool."
5,A good place to begin,"This book is an excellent place to begin learning about Autism for any parent of a newly diagnosed child. It is also an excellent resource for teachers, family memebers or anyone else whose life will be touched because of Autism."
5,For the Fantasy Football Fan,"As someone who started playing Fantasy Football in 1992 and has not missed a season since, I have lived through many of the same things as the writer. My first question is how did he get his wife to let him take a year off jsut to play fantasy football? He is one lucky guy. I have also learned that it doesn't matter how much research. etc. you do sometimes it's just plain luck.If you play or want to play fantast football this book will give you an idea of what it's like."
5,Illiterate about fantasy football? This is the book for you!,"I picked out this book on the title alone; it sounded interesting and even though I did not know the first thing about fantasy football, I figured it would be a good learning experience. Well it turned out to be more than that. I began to feel the pain and euphoria that Mark experienced when his team won or lost and I found myself rooting for a guy I never met and a team of players that I'd never heard of. (That shows just how little I knew about real football, let alone fantasy.) After finishing the book in record time, you definitely want to keep reading to find out what happens to his team, I realized I had found the perfect gift for half of my friends, both male and female. I haven't yet decided to try fantasy football for myself, but I have decided that Mark St. Amant is a great storyteller and I look forward to future publishings."
4,"Finally, fantasy football explained to us non-players!",Bought the book for my husband who plays fantasy football and now I understand its appeal. Very humorous and quick to read. I read it after my husband did!
1,Pay Bill Simmons His Money,"Great concept, I found the book to be pretty uninspired and choppy. The author definitely was influenced by ESPNs Sports Guy Bill Simmons, reads like a less skilled Simmons rant. I wish I could agree with the other reviews."
5,great read for a early 30s FF guy,"I really enjoyed this book, particularly the details of the most-celebrated event of the season: the FF draft. My favorite part was the picks of That Guy, picking the KC defense of the fourth round. As a resident ""that guy"" last year, I laughed out loud at some of my comparable picks (Tim Brown last year in the seventh round, Rice in the sixth).The book really captures the essence/neurosis/insanity of being a FF fan. It's like the quote from Frank DeFord: fantasy baseball is like marriage and FF is like sex.Another nice touch: the colorful FF team names and the tips for beginners.Great read."
4,Fantasy Football Unplugged - And Good Stories Too,"Mark St. Amant has put together an enjoyable book that takes us through his year as a full-time fantasy football junkie. But this book is also more than that. Mr. St. Amant is a skilled writer who provides great descriptions of how he quit his job and convinced his bride to go along with his plan. He weaves in the interesting history of fantasy sports and introduces us to a cast of characters from across America who share this hobby with millions of other Americans.It's a fun book and an excellent first effort by a pretty talented writer. Definately worth a read and the perfect ""vacaction"" book."
3,Entertaining but....,"I liked this book but at times it dwelled to much on the authors own FF team from 2004. The stories about the FFL's he visited was interesting and there was some good technical information here and there, all with a humorous twist.You know how it is when someone insists on telling you about their Fantasy Football team? What if it was their Fantasy Team from three years ago? That's where this book gets a bit cumbersome for me but if you are interested in what it's like to be insane about Fantasy Football this is a good read."
5,Entertaining even for girls!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mark St. Amant's ""Committed."" I wanted to learn about Fantasy Football without having to try to glean information from some glossy magazine made for people in the know. But chicks love narrative and so I was lucky that his memoir was out there. It was delightfully bawdy at times and funny from beginning to end. He dispenses not only facts but touching stories about folks who maintain and nurture friendships across the years. Smack talk included, it's really very sweet. Indeed, for ladies, there could be no better sports book, than one in which the author proclaims again and again, how much he loves his wife."
2,A repeat of the Books Online,"I wasn't impressed with this book. If you take out all the info that's already covered quite adequately in the Books Online, you don't have much of a book left. I was expecting a book that would take me to the next level as an administrator, but was sorely disappointed. Recommend you get Soukup/Delaney's book Inside SQL Server 7.0 instead."
2,Mediocre; largely a waste of time,Found this book really shallow and lacking in technical depth. It's really a mediocre little piece of work. Can't recommend it for the serious DBA. Get Inside SQL Server by Kalen Delaney -- it's a lot better.
1,Just a printed BOL (Books OnLine),"No new info here. No expert insights. This book is a poorly written, sophomoric waste of print. Not worth the trouble."
1,A pathetic excuse for a guide,"I'm really embarrassed that I spent my money on this""guide."" It's a tour of the GUI tools. It's biggest flaw isits awful prose. The author obviously is no writer. It's boring, bland, and altogether colorless. It's written in the style of an automobile user manual -- pedestrian to a fault."
2,"OK information, but much better books available","Not a very good book...Indide SQL Server by Ron Soukup is much better. The index in the back doesn't have hardly anything in it; I can never find what I'm looking for. When I do find it, there is never very much content on the topic, just a little fluff and some screenshots.There's the occasional nugget, but I wouldn't search through all the junk to get to it."
4,Pretty good - read it at Border's for 2 hours bef ordering,"Already brought other SQL 6.5/7.0. SQL 7.0 Dev, sql Comp, Using sql 7.0 by Wynkoop. So looking for book that takes time to explain concepts. Example Linked servers is new, good/decent coverage, vs remote servers. Other SQL 7.0 did not cover. So looking for SQL 7.0 books that cover stuff not found in others. Unfortunately I just only ordered it so I may revise my review later.I am taking MS 1 week course to pass SQL 7.0 70-028 exam, so anything that helps with this. Other books by MS ADM 7.0/SQL 7.0 Unleashed not out yet so I am stuck. Ones I already have by Osborne I would give 3-4 stars."
1,Just a BOL reprint,"This is really just a BOL (Books Online) reprint. It's a clumsy tour through the GUI tools. It doesn't give you anything that isn't a already click of the mouse away anyway (in the BOL). I bought it with the following expectations:* Concise explanations of what to look out for when migrating 6.5 to 7.0* Caveats for beginners to look out for* Best practices when managing large DBs* Differences between 6.5 and 7.0 internals* A rundown of good 3rd-party admin toolsI got none of these. Instead, what we have is a dull treatise on the graphical tools. Even the BOL are more interesting than this knock-off.Shelly Sierra"
1,I'm not impressed,"I don't know who told the author he either wrote well enough to write a book of his own or knew the subject material well enough to do so, but whoever they were, they were wrong. This book is little more than a cursory overview of the GUI tools. It's no more an admin guide than a Dummies book on balancing your checkbook. Equally as troubling is the complete absence of interesting prose. This one'll put you to sleep if you let it."
3,Non Fiction,"Efficient Microsoft guide, done in the ususal Microsoft fashion. Or, in other words, there are better books you can get about this software, if you need to, rather than the actual party line publication that you have here.If you get it cheap, that is fine, or if it is all you have available."
1,Need a print out of the BOL (Books Online)? Buy this book.,"This book is nothing more than a collection of articles straight out of the BOL and screen pictures. If you're looking for a book with at least a modicum of substance, keep looking. Not only is the technical info nothing to write home about, Talmage can't write - the writing is absolutely dreadful."
1,Misses lots of (most) important details,I did not think this book helped me much. It is no better than Microsoft manuals. Should offer help above what comes with the product. Also much of the example code does not work. I feel like I wasted my purchase.
1,A perfunctory tour of the GUI tools,"Far from a useful DBA guide, this book is merely a printed tour of the GUI tools. There's no real advice here on how one should manage a system. There are no caveats for new DBAs or people new to SQL Server. On the contrary, this book spends most of its time guiding the reader through the graphical tools. What's the point? I have no idea."
1,"Nondescript, boring treatment","This book is, in a word, nondescript. It's plain, it's dull. There's nothing here to really arouse one's interest. This is a perfunctory tour of the GUI tools -- nothing more. Recommend you skip this one. Inside SQL Server is much better."
1,This book has no valid reason to exist,I got this book expecting a book similar to Inside SQL Server that was geared specifically toward administrators. I was sorely disappointed. The writing and coverage in this work is strictly pedestrian -- it is prosaic to a fault. I can't understand why it actually exists. There's nothing about it to differentiate it from the scads of other SQL Server admin books.
5,ONE OF THE BEST!!,"I saw these guys live in Portland, ME on New Years Eve 1999. They blew my husband and I away and we've been listening to this CD ever since. INCREDIBLE!!!Kadi's voice is stunning and Fattie can rap with the best of them. I hear they broke up.... I hope it's not true."
4,Great Aussie band,This is an incredible band. Very reminiscent of early English rock music. The band makes great use of Traditional folk instrumentation and themes to communicate a unique view of the world through Western Pop music. The only comparison that does them any justice is to say that the band is the Australian equivalent of Uncle Tupelo. In the end the band is just plan fun and refreshing. They prove that you can still rescue pop music from the clutches of mass production.
5,Thank You To The Other Reviewers!,"Thank you to all of you who have written here about this lovely album. Yes, this is a great one. I was 18 when this came out in '68 and, yes, I listened to Jimi Hendrix and Cream also. That was the great thing about the 60s -- diversity, and it didn't matter what you listened to. The Association were NEVER ""cool"" and so in their own way they were TOTALLY cool. I had bought every album up to this point and I didn't miss Birthday. I will admit there were always tracks on their albums that I considered goofy, or misguided, most often when they tried to rock out. (This album has one of those.) But the beauty! Unsurpassed. There are five or six songs on this album that I could not do without in my life. Often many years pass between listenings, but I am always thrilled to hear them again. So switch off your Cool-O-Meter and listen to some real talent. This album is stunning."
5,"lesser known, but the best!!",This is my all time fav Association album...all the songs are great and refreshing to hear over and over. Brings back many fond memories when I played this on my phonograph. A must add for any fan of the Association or the late 60's!
4,Often considered to be their best album...,"...I admit that I don't love ""Birthday"" as much as everyone else does...while the standout tracks are really *standouts*, all in all there seems to be a bit too much ""spirit"" and not enough ""songcraft"" going around. Nevertheless, a very good album, and seemingly everyone else likes it enough to give it a recommendation, so I'll follow suit. I do think, however, that self-titled and Renaissance are better examples of what this band can do, however."
5,Birthday!,"""Birthday"" showcases The Association's unsurpassed harmonies, with songs which, for the most part, are reflective and personal. This CD does not sound at all like any other Association CD, as it focuses more on their softer side. Better known songs on the CD include ""Everything That Touches You"" and ""Time For Livin'"". Noteworthy for it's beautiful vocal harmonies are ""Barefoot Gentleman"" and ""Birthday Morning"". After listening to these songs, you too will feel as I do, that The Association is possibly the most overlooked and underrated groups of all time. It's a shame that The Association did not have an even greater commercial success, as it could've meant more music by them being made available for us to enjoy. Interesting too are the liner notes which describe the ""song that got away"", ""MacArthur Park"". They don't make bands-or songs-like this anymore."
5,The Old Testament,Around my house we have called this vegetarian masterpiece the Old Testament for 15 years. It is simply the best. You Vegetarian? Trust me. Buy it and you will be a believer too.
4,What a roller coaster ride Ms Madison had us on!,"Sheneska girl, an excellent book. I was drawn into each character. The only problem is, you've made us more painfully aware that men like Chris hardly exist. And, that's too bad, too, cause alot of us could use a Chris in our lives. Right from the jump, I was drawn into the book. These were unforgettable characters, all of them. Thanks Shen for a good read."
4,What a wonderful story!,"I stumbled upon this book, not knowing much about the author. But after completing this book in 2 days, I can't wait to read more from her. A modern story about relationships, with an twist not normally found in relationship books. I loved it and everyone I have recommended it to has as well."
5,EYE OPENER,I READ THIS BOOK AND COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THIS BOOK REALLY HIT HOME. SHENESKA JACKSON HAS OUT DONE HERSELF WHEN SHE WROTE THIS BOOK. I SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO EVERY ONE WHO IS DATING. THIS BOOK WILL REALLY MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SEXUAL DECISIONS. GOOD WORK SHENESKA!
3,Surprising,"Li'l Mamas Rules was a heavy surprise since when I started out reading the book I thought it would be some kind of a Cinderella story. Which, in fact it was... but with an even tougher lesson for Madison to learn before getting her Prince Charming (Chris). I liked that. And I liked the style Jackson uses which really gives the reader vivid pictures of the characters and their whereabouts. Happy ending though... Fortunately I guess I should say."
2,Lil mamas terrible rules,"When a freind told me about this book, she mentioned how in one scene Madison, the main character shares an intimate meeting with a caucasion guy, and suddenly screams out in fear when she finds out his............ahem.....member is pink. Okay, and that was what kind of what brought me to read this book, I wanted to find out more about this character, and really confirm my freinds opinion on if this book was really that bad. Once I started, it was all confirmed, this was a very dry book. Madison, a succesful teacher wasnn't at all charming, she came off as a Miss Know it all when really she didn't know much. I also found all her rules to be ver dumb and downright unnessacary. The one part of this book that got to me was when she was making out with the caucasion guy and shrieked when she found out what the color of his penis was. I mean what color was she expecting it to be. Very dumb, naive woman."
4,the truth,"I thought overall that the book was good. However, at the beginning the first five chapters were all drama. I read these types of books often and After a while you get kind of tired of all the drama( you know, she likes him, but wants the other guy, even though she is dedicated to that one guy,type drama)But towards the middle of the book, it takes an interesting spin, and then you can't put the book down! I think out of all the lessons you are taught in high school about STDs. this book is the best eye opener as to what the true effect of it is. If you want to learn about STDs this is the book to read!!!"
5,Surprise Twist!,"This story moved me in a way I didn't think possible. While the voice of Madison was sassy, it was also quite entertaining. I started out reading it over a period of days and flipped to the ending by mistake. That compelled me to read 2/3 of the book in one night and I wanted to cry. The book covered various topics regarding family dysfunction, disease, relationships, and a host of other issues. If one read the synopsis and went by the title, one would never guess that the story would turn out the way it did. The twist offers a touch a reality that many women of this age need. I would definitely recommend this story as a reality check for both men and women alike."
2,AIGHT,THIS BOOK WASN'T A LIKE FOR ME. IT WASN'T THAT INTERSITING TO ME AT ALL. ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A READ BUT YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN.
4,this book really kept me wanting to read more,"first of all, i must say that i have enjoyed your work and can't wait until your next novel is published. please don't leave us hanging! i never used to read very often but i must say your books have given me a start. i feel comfortable holding one of your books in my hand simply because i know i will not only ENJOY it but learn something from one of your characters depicted in your novel. my only ReQuEsT is that you make 'Caught Up in the Rapture a MOVIE. I would be there in a flash~~keep writing girl no matter what people suggest you should do regarding your writing career."
3,I was looking for more.,"This is my first read by Sheneska Jackson. I enjoyed the book; however, it took me some time to get into. I couldn't get into the relationship between the main character and those surrounding her, except her hatred for her father. You only had glimpses of her other family relationships. The ending was too much like a fairy tale. But hey, it's a book right?"
4,A book to make you look inside yourself.,"After reading 'Lil Mama's Rules', I thought how often we fail to appreciate an honest man. Though Madison had serious problems because of her father or lack thereof, she expected something from Chirs, that she didn't give, perfection. Chris' action cannot be condonned, but he was honest, she kicked him to the curb, and then proceeded to believe the lies almost every other man told her, go figure. She should have been more honest with herself. Her sexual philosophy and her sexual promiscuity were not realistic. When you're as reckless as she was, you have to take care of business. I like Jackson's writing I will definitely read more of her works."
2,"This was another typical ""Woe is me"" book","I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't. I actually had a hard time reading the whole thing. I don't the the story flowed well, not that it was hard to follow, but there were a few too many flashbacks. Plus, the fact that Madison wanted to blame everyone, from her absentee father to all the sorry men in her life, for her problems really irritated me. Take some responsibility for yourself. ""Caught Up in the Rapture"" was a better story and I enjoyed the characters a lot more. Maybe her next book will be a winner."
2,"The concept was good, but the book could have been better.","After reading this book I was highly disappointed. I thought that it would at least be as good as the first, but I was very much mistaken. I would have enjoyed this book more if it had been realistic and had a character that willing to step off of her soapbox for a minute to see the error of her ways, instead of blaming all of the bad things in her life on her father and Chris. I would definitely recommend Caught Up In the Rapture, but not this. Not to say that she is a bad writer, because she is very talented, I think that is why I was so disappointed. She had a good concept, but the delivery was unacceptable."
2,Spellbound,"I just finshed reading this book last night and I'm still speechless. Even though,it was much better then her first book, it was sort of hard to follow.Ms Jackson would guide us along and then stop to do a flashback. And by the time she brought you back, you would forget what you had read before the flashback started. And Madison, what can I say about Madison. She spent the hold time whinning about how Chris did her wrong and how he scarred her for life and everything. I could understand where she was comig from,but after awhile I started to really got sick and tired of it. I was really glad when I finshed it and I won't be reading it again anythme soon"
2,An Uphill Battle,"I was highly disappointed as I struggled to read this novel. The use of extremely long paragraphs made for difficult reading. The theme and overall message borders on ""overkill"". As an Afro-American woman, I feel that African American writers should try to come up with something more than ""relationships, dating and safe sex"" issues. Surely Ms. Jackson can capture more of the African-American experience as demonstrated in CAUGHT UP IN THE RAPTURE or BLESSINGS."
4,Excellent!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book, I have struggled with myself. All topics were covered. I loved the message.. I also agree with it, I have always stayed that children learn from there first examples.... If the examples are missing children will teach themselves, by looking... A lot of woman, in search of a father, alot of young mothers are in search of their mother..etc. I would recommend this to anyone, with an open mind"
3,Totally with the 90's.,"I enjoyed this book. At first I thought it was totally whimsical, but took a very serious turn. I felt that the story had a very important lesson in it. I gave it to my teen-age daughter to read. I can't wait to read blessings. This book was chosen as the book to read for my bookclub (April). Most comments by members were positive comments towards the book."
3,A good beginning but the end wasn't.,"The beginning of this book was all of that, but at the end it became boring. Maybe it was too wrapped up for me. When I read the rest of Jackson's books, I hope they aren't like this one."
4,Life Lesson,"If this book doesn't teach how to ""wrap it up"" then I dont know what book does. Coming from a teenager myself, this story has a good moral to it and a lot of young females (males too) should read this book."
5,A++++++++!,"This book told a story about a everyday life, and that's what made it hit so close to home. This is a book I think a lot of young black girls & boys should read. I was very satisfied with this purchase! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK-"
5,this is the book to read for the women of the 90's!,"this book kept my attention and made tears come to my eye's more than once. The way the sisters depended on eachother reminded me of my own relationship with my sister, and the ending is remarkable! Great job miss. jackson!"
3,Great and Real,"This book was very slow at the beginning, but it turned out to be a good book after all. Although Lil Mama was a very naive person she didn't take no trash from no one."
5,Truer to life than you think,"This book was so well written. Li'L Mama did what most women did held their, boyfriends and or potential husbands against the type of man their father was whether it is good or bad. It usually takes an eye opening event to change your views. In this case a tragic event. I was totaly unprepaired for what she would soon have to face. But she had the strength and courage. This book took me on emotional roller coaster and it was well worth the trip. This is one book you should have in your collection sisters"
4,update 11/29/12,"Ok, so after about six weeks, i finally was able to put the bed together properly. (see earlier review- in summary, rusted pieces, replacements without screws, dealer nice, screws sent.)i like it. i love canopy beds and it looks exactly how i wanted it to. i docked half a star for needing replacement parts, and another half star because i can't vouch for the sturdiness of it- I'm only using it to surround a free-standing platform bed (pics being uploaded). But for looks alone, price, and experience with seller, it's great, I'd order again, definitely."
3,"Flimsy, and looks cheap","Overall, the appearance is flimsy and cheap looking. It was actually difficult to install and we were only able to install the headboard piece. The foot-board piece is being stored in the basement. Very unhappy with the seller, arrived in a taped up second-hand damaged box also."
3,Cute bed,I love this canopy...it brings that xtra look to my what use to be boring bedroom. Although its not the most sturdy bed. I wished I would have known that b4 I brought it. Even still im not complaining...great bed for the price
4,Huge,this canopy is awesome but way bigger than u think it is going to be. better have a lot of room if u wanna get this canopy
4,Review,It's not the best quality but it was pretty simple to put together and looks amazing with curtains hung up on it so it's worth buying.
2,bed,"This was just the frame, did not come with the bottom piece to hold the bed together, was not the way it looked in the picture and when I returned the item I had to fight with the company to get my money back and I did not receive my money back until I threatened an attorney and contacted amazon, it was ridiculous."
3,canopy bed frame,I like the look of this bed and it wasn't hard to put together but its so flimsy and shaky! It moves every time you sit on the bed and doesn't fit around it correctly. I actually looks like its about to fall over! A bit disappointed.
4,good condition-great price,school bookstore listed this book at $65. Got it here for $10. Very small water damage maybe 20 pages in the corner...great buy.
4,It is a very nice text book.,I like the way they divide the readings the way they did. It makes it easy and less boring to read
4,Great book on diversity in America,This book gives a very broad and encompassing look at many of the topics that contribute to and affect diversity and differences in America today.
3,College Textbook,"While the text offers important thought provoking articles and essays on Race Gender and Social Issues, it is not Student friendly text. A text with such a wide array of information should offer a section of review at the end of each reading. By having a review ""for students"", it ensures an understanding of concepts and objectives. Furthermore, it offers students a place to review when studying for exams. I give the text a 5 star rating for the informative articles and essays but 1 star for none existing review material."
2,WHY?,"Why would any professor want to use this book. I was doing alright until I came to the chapters on economic growth. These chapters used old data. How do you gauge economic growth and its effects on the poor when you are using data from 12 years ago(6 years from the edition I have)? A lot has changed in 12 years, especially with the recent economic downturn we took. There are many excellent lessons in social construction and diversity but the outdated information takes away from some lessons."
4,By the side of the side of the outside,"Out is good. Away is even better. Far away is better still.In the late 60's I remember seeing a hitchhiker outside San Francisco holding a cardboard sign with one word: OUT.This book recounts the glories of OUT, which are many: freedom, choices, time to think, creation, and many, many more.It also warns any potential away-getters that others, for example, moms; dads; friends; potential mates hunting you down; possibly, though not necessarily, siblings; former teachers (not mentioned in the book but also likely, :-)) ) and sundry others.This can be and is marketed as a child's picture book by our witty and simultaneously biting friend Jules Feiffer, but it is for the child in anyone.It reached the child in me and, for 20 or so light minutes before I picked my fourth grader son up at school, made me, may I utter it, happy.I hope and trust it will do the same for you whether you have a fourth grader or not."
4,Pretty cross/nix the chain.....,"This tiny cross (about a 1/2 inch long) is very pretty and nicely set, but the chain is VERY cheap-looking. I put my cross on one of my good silver 16-inch chains and it looks beautiful, now. It is sparkly and looks ""believeable"" for the money."
1,Not what I hoped for,The necklace I received didn't come the the chain in the picture. I don't even know if the chain it came with is sterling silver or not. Not impressed with the earrings or the necklace.
1,This Film is Poorly Produced and Directed,"While browsing Amazon products I stumbled across this film. I have the VHS version and gift from my Sensei many years ago (the video came out in the mid-late 90s). George Alexander is an accomplished martial artist and host this video, but it will either put you to sleep or yes, like another reviewer wrote, give you vertigo.While I'm grateful for the gift, I do want to save others from purchasing it, so, to make this a one star reviewer for the third review in a row - one star."
2,Mom,"The dog is very cute, but that is about it. First, it calls for ""D"" batteries on the box as well as on the battery compartment; however, when you open up the case it holds only ""AA"" batteries. After inserting batteries he breathed once and then stopped. He still doesn't breathe regularly but will occassionally when my husband hits him in the correct spot. If my daughter didn't like the animal so much I would return it."
2,Doesn't deliver on it's promises,"When the Amazon provider decided, after 10 days, that they didn't actually have this item in stock, I had to reorder it elsewhere. The item is very disappointing. The breathing motion is hardly noticable, and the ""Snoozing sounds"" are just the constant drone of the tiny motion motor. Yes, it's cute, but it's really nothing more than a plush knick-knack."
3,Not St. Bernard size!,"This is a very cute product, Saint Bernard shaped, but definitely not Saint Bernard sized.Its head is about the size of a baseball, and any of us who actually have known Saint puppies know that they are never quite that small!"
2,Bun did not cool dog down,"My dog was hot. I gave him the bun to eat, hoping that it would cool him down. He seemed to be panting as much after eating the bun as he did before. I would have to say that the ""hot dog bun"" did not do a good job helping my dog keep cool. In the future, I will stick with giving my dog water."
2,It is not the same one in the picture,"I received mine today, it is not the same one shows in the picture. I tried to open my Tissot and SOLVIL et TITUS , no luck at all."
3,Another tool to use and discard.,"I needed a watch wrench ASAP to service waterproof watches for several clients. The tool works okay, but is of a very low quality. Be sure to press the bits firmly in place and you might want to use a needle-nose pliers to remove them when your task is complete. Also I would recommend that you obtain a pair of good quality Magnifying Glasses or Duel Glass Loops, and a Fluorescent Lamp to assist your tasks. Hey, you get what you pay for, a cheap tool at an affordable price. Soon I will be replacing this one with a high end Swiss made Watch Wrench. I'm satisfied with this one which will suffice until I get the other one."
5,Nice tool,Documentation is a little lacking but the tool itself is well made and works great. Has already paid for itself!
5,It work,"I want to be able to change my own watch battery. I bought this tool so I will be able to change my own battery. It was very easy to use. So far I changed the battery on my watch 3 times already. I just go to the store and buy the battery when my watch died. Once I get home, I use this tool and open the back of my watch. It only take me a minute to replace the battery."
3,Good tool if you know what you're doing????,"I received the tool in perfect condition. Looks good and sturdy and a great wooden storage box. However, it does not come with instructions. Beware, if you're a beginner."
3,Fairly Good,Works well on watches with notched screw on backs but I could not get it to remove the serrated edge back (similar to Rolex type back) on an older Victorinox quartz pocket watch.
4,easy to figure out,"Documentation makes it seem that there should be an included Watch Holding Vise, I just use my other hand. I'm glad I made the purchase."
3,Inexpensive but does the job,"I bought this tool to open several watch cases and change batteries myself. The tool is as advertised. Quality is so-so, what you'd expect to find from an ""odd lots"" type store selling cheap Chinese import tools but it works fine. The tool itself is better than expected, but the case is pretty poor (would have preferred a plastic case). Regardless however the tool worked fine for my needs. If you're expecting Swiss made quality, you'll be very disappointed, so look elsewhere (and be prepared to pay). I'm pretty satisfied because it did what I needed for a low price and will last me many years."
1,cheap product,"The bits keep falling out of the holder. I cannot use it at all. When I have the handle up-side-down to insert the bits, it's fine. Then I have to turn it down-side-up in order to put it over the watch. One of the bits fell out from the handle. without one of the three, I cannot open the watch case. Totally useless. It didn't come with the wooden box. It came with a cheap blue plastic holder without the cover. It's just a plastic case with holes for the bits and a longer hole for the handle. It's only half the length of the whole handle."
3,Professional Kit,I don't have any idea why I bought this kit...it's for a pro watch reapirman or someone who knows about watches; I only know how to wear tem and tell the time. It looks great in my manly toolbox though!
2,Waterproof Watch Case Opener in Wooden Box,Look like a sturdy tool. Does not look like waterproof. I found moisture in the plastic that wraps the tool and trace of rust though it appeared to have been rubbed with oil.
1,Don't buy this,This product is poorly made. The pins fall out as you hold it face down. The other reviews are correct in that you have to hold it upside down to prevent the pins from falling out. Don't buy this. Go to Wal Mart and get one for three bucks in the watch department and save your money.
4,Works as advertised,"This tool is solidly constructed. It comes with an assortment of attachments and adjustable configurations for different types or brands of watches. It comes wrapped in a sturdy protective wooden box. The tool was a little greasy / oily when I received it in the mail which I found to be a little unusual, but understandable from a preservation perspective. It's a good tool. Get this one!"
4,This tool works,"I was able to replace a battery in my watch. It didn't come with any instructions. I experienced some of the same problems other reviewers had with the bits being loose and falling out, but I discovered you have to push them into the sockets hard. They were snug after that. Then you have to adjust the tool to fit the slots on your watch. Hold the watch in one hand. Turn left to loosen the back, then right to tighten. It came in a nice wooden box."
4,worked as advertised,I was paying $10 to get my battery changed in my Fossil watch every year or two.. I bought a battery for $2 bucks and with this tool...basically paid for itself. Mine did not come with any instructions but was easy to figure out..and like others said..just push in the correct bit all the way and it will not fall out. The other bits are odd looking and curious what kind of watch takes them but I only needed the one set for all my watches.. Very pleased. Not giving 5 stars because there are no instructions and the case is lame..but still a good buy.
3,Watch case back opener does the job,"This device worked great. I had no problems and I could open the back cover without removing the band. There are a number of different pins to choose from so it is quite versatile. However, I think next time I would recommend buying a combination set of tools. I ended up purchasing some small screw drivers and then modifying the smallest of the group so I could loosen a screw. This was necessary to loosen a bracket which held the battery in place. Once i did this, removal and installation of the energizer 395 went very smoothly. To summarize, good tool, but if you are doing overall watch repair and replacing batteries and so fourth, you may need more tools so consider getting a combination tool set."
1,Paper box not a wooden box pictured,Ok the tool looks real cool in that wooden box with the inserts each in a little hole. What I was shiped was in a paper box with the tools in a little paper box.Sorry - not as represented!As far as the tool goes - I feel riped off and I'm returning it.
1,I am not mechanically challenged but,"I find this tool to be rather useless in most cases. It can really open only one type of watch back. The design may be ""conceptually"" right, but it really is not workable. I have at least a dozen watches,that belong to the family members, that needs battery change but I could only open 1 of them. Plus if you have an expensive watch, do not use this tool. It can scratch up the sides and the back. At least this has been my experience.I am not very impressed. Thing is I don't know what else is out there that I can use. The construction of the tool seems to be robust, but it really does not work or work only for very specific watches."
1,The pins don't fit,"I could not figure out how to get the pins to stay in the slots, which negated every other positive aspect of this tool. It looks good, has a nice case, feels nice to the touch, and comes with 4 types of pins. However, the slots have small protrusions that prevent the pins from sliding in securely. There were no instructions, also."
3,Good But...,"Nice photos but a little boring for the average sailor. I prefer the action and color of Sharon Green's 2004 Ultimate Sailing Calendar, www.ultimatesailing.com"
4,"Emma's ""Girl"" is Awesome!!","First was Geri Halliwell's ""Schizophonic""--it was ok. Then it was Melanie C's ""Northern Star""--IT was ok. Then came Melanie B's ""Hot""--mind blowing-the best of the bunch. Now, in between ""Hot"" and the others is Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)and HER solo effort, ""A Girl Like Me"". This album is just wonderful, and every song got me singing along minutes later. Favorites include ""Spell it O.U.T."", ""Been There, Done That"", and her dead-on cover if Edie Brickell's ""What I Am"". If you are an fan of any of the Spice Girl's efforts (solo OR alone), you HAVE TO GET this album. You won't be dissappointed!!!!"
3,Good Job Emma!,"Ok, I dont know why I am always so hesitant to blow off good music. Emma Bunton shines. I just love 'Were not gonna sleep tonight' It should have been her first single off the album. I also listen to 'Sunshine on a rainy day' repeatedly. It almost sounds like Madonna's 'Dont tell me' only peppier. I also love 'A girl like me' It is so true!!!I have to say I dont care for 'What took you so long?' or 'Take my breath away' or 'She was a friend of mine'I think she makes magic!"
4,A Surprisingly Good CD!!,"I bought this cd because I really liked the song ""What Took You So Long"" and wanted to check out the rest of Emma Bunton's, songs. Surprisingly I found myself really liking the album. It's a great disc to listen to while commuting. Most of the songs are fun and sweet. However, I didn't care too much for ""Spell it O.U.T"". The repetitive spelling of O.U.T got to be annoying after a while. Also, I didn't care too much for her remake of ""What I Am."" I prefer that when artists remake a song that they give it a twist to make it at the least a little different than the original, but this version didn't sound to different than the original which made it a little dull. For these reasons I give the cd four stars out of five. I would recommend this cd for those who aren't into artist that yell and scream. If you're looking for a soft sound that's a little upbeat than this is a nice cd to try out."
3,Too many styles for the Bunton,"When Emma released What took you so long in the UK, I loved it! And then she released 'Take me breath away' which is one of the best songs I've ever heard, it's so beautiful. Then 'We're not gonna sleep tonight' was released, didn't sell well and she lost her deal. They were the UK singles, but the rest of the album is more RnBish. I'm a sucker for guitar pop (Bellefire, Dido etc). But RnB isn't quite my thing. The guitar songs are brilliant, all 10/10 but the other tracks are nice enough but nothing quite striking. A girl like me is disco - disco music gets nowhere these days. Sunshine on a rainy day is the best album track - a beautiful mid-tempo guitar song. Now Emma has released a 2nd album called 'Free me' which is 60's influenced and has the same flaws. If Emma had stuck with the guitar pop, she would have done much better and I would have been an addicted fan."
2,Getting worse?,"Well, after a series of solo Spice albums, Emma Bunton, aka Baby Spice, releases her first solo album.What's there to say? Nothing much. The album is downright boring! First single, What Took You So Long stands out as a sure hit, but other than that, the rest of the songs in this stupidly sugary album are incredibly wishy washy.Emma doesn't have the greatest pipes, she's no Melanie C, but she's a step above both Geri Halliwell and Victoria Beckham. Too bad she wasted her time with this disc - Spice Mania is over and the bubble has burst. If she was to be ranked on the basis of her solo effort, she'd fall flat on her face."
2,I was disappointed!,"I thought this album would be as good as Mel C's album, but it wasn't good, or at least; not for me. Waste of many, I'm a huge Spice Girls Fan, but this is not my kind of music. Like emma says ""Simple as that"".1. What Took You So Long? It's ok 2. Take My Breath Away: A good song 3. World Without You: This is my favorite 4. High On Love: I hate this song 5. Girl Like Me: This is the worst song, ever! 6. Spell It O.U.T.: I hate this sone too. 7. Sunshine On A Rainy Day: It's one of the best songs of the album. Jus for this song * star. 8. Been There Done That: And for this song one more * star. 9. Better Be Careful: I like this song too 10. We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight: This song is stupid 11. She Was A Friend Of Mine: It's ok 12. What I Am: I love this song"
4,Emma shines on her debut!,"Emma Bunton was always my favorite member of The Spice Girls. I adored her voice which, while not the strongest, is very sweet and pleasant. So, I really looked forward to getting her solo album and I was not disappointed at all. Out of all of the other Spice solo albums, Emma's has to be the best with catchy, cute songs (most of which she co-wrote) and great melodies. With songs like ""A Girl Like Me"", ""Better Be Careful"", and ""We're Not Going to Sleep Tonight"", she definitely has a winner. It's just a shame that most U.S. fans are deprived of what I have to consider some of Emma's best work. It easily eclipses a lot of what is currently seen as popular. I highly recommend this album to all who love good pop."
5,another great album by a great artist,First of all everyone should have this album even if you are not a fan of the spice girls after all Emma is a very talented singer and if you hear her sing on this album I am sure you will agree I bought this album and friends of mine who are more into Rap When they heard this Album they told me they liked When I told thim who it was they did not believe me until I showed them them Cd cover and they where in shock they said they did not know she could sing like that now if you need anymore proof then that So what Are you waiting for Order this album right now you will not regretit they did and they ordered a copy from ..Right from my House.
1,Not What I want,"I bought this C.D. recently. Being a fan of the Spice Girls though not Baby Spice I decided to check it out anyhow. BIg mistake. It's just not my type of music...check out Scream if You Wanna Go Faster, Geri Halliwell's new album! Now that is the best!"
4,Excellent debut CD from Emma!,"Emma Bunton's ""A Girl Like Me"" is a wonderful debut. It is filled with pop hooks and superb vocals. The first track, ""What Took You So Long?"" sets the mood for the entire song collection; it is simply a great pop song. ""High on Love"" has a wonderfully sweet melody. I agree with the reviewer who loves ""Sunshine on a Rainy Day""--it is the best track on the CD. This was a great start; she followed this up with 2005's ""Free Me,"" which I believe is the best solo Spice release yet."
3,it's okay... good for one time play,"My son who is 3, totally mastered this game in 5 minutes and wins all the time... he still plays with it, but not as intended. It is a great little matching game for beginners."
1,Think what you're doing,"Two objections:1) This toy is unsafe.2) Candy needs no extra promotion for children.Giving small children toy candy that's a choking hazard does not make sense.Obviously these pretend confections will be popped in many mouths.With so many more appropriate things in the world they could play with, sort, or learn from, stimulating interest in candy at all is not doing kids any favors."
1,Plastic toxic smell.....,"I received this as a gift for my daughter. Once opened, I was repulsed on how much of that (STRONG) plastic toxic smell was emitted. I then tried to let the chocolates de-gas outside, for about three days. No luck with the toxic smell leaving. I had no choice but to throw it out. HIGHLY disappointed."
3,Great toy BUT fix the lid already!!!,"I saw this toy in a special education catalog and loved how realistic it looked. I read the reviews that indicated that the lid not fitting securely was a problem but bought it anyway. This is a great color/shape matching toy, but it is really frustrating that when you get all the candies in the box the lid does not fit. It makes it really difficult to store away and it makes my daughter mad that the lid keeps falling off. I am amazed that Smart Snacks has not fixed this problem considering all of the poor reviews. Too bad about the lid because it is a super cute toy. As long as you understand what you are getting it is still a great toy."
2,Cute but..but..but,"This is a cute little toy, but maybe I didn't read the right reviews. The little chocolates are just fun to play with, but the box doesn't fit together so it's really hard to store. You can't put half of the candy tops on the candies and still close the little heart container, it's really inconvienient to store and keep together, easy to loose the parts, too bad, but I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone."
3,me,"Really liked the idea of this toy however have a couple of issues with it. First of all the materials it was made of has a very strong unpleasant smell and I have to let it air out. Which leads me to my second issue, that may be the reason the lid was made to not fit tightly on it. Other then that my child liked it."
4,Come Go with Expose,"Expose perfected the Latin pop genre well before Jennifer Lopez ran it to the ground. Often produced by Lewis Martinee, their songs were bouncy, fun, and danceable. The average Joe Schmo couldn't name any of the members in this girl group, but who cares? What mattered was the music, and on this hits collection, we're treated to the group's hits, which have enough hooks to sink the Titanic. ""Come Go With Me,"" ""Point of No Return,"" and ""Seasons Change"" are such well-crafted pop ditties that recall those glorious late 1980s. Expose struggled to keep the hits coming in later years, but this hits collection is a solid collection of above-average pop tunes well worth a listen."
5,Another great 80's group,"This is yet another great 80's girl group. They kept making hits left and right for quite awhile. When you think of the 80's cool dance music, you can't help but think of Expose. They also had some awesome love songs as well.I think my favorite songs by Expose are ""Come Go With Me"" and ""Point Of No Return"". Another good song, from later in their career, is ""In Walked Love"". This CD is a great collection of some of their best hits. Another must for the 80's music collector."
4,Expose Greatest Hits,"Hey I really like this CD. My three favorite songs are: ""End of the World,"" ""I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me,"" (a classic), and my fave, ""I'll Say Good-Bye For the Two of Us."" Does anyone know the lyrics to it? Thanx!!!"
4,A Great CD,"This is a wonderful CD. My favorite is ""I'll Never Get Over You"", but most of the others are great as well. Two complaints, however, for the remixes of ""Come Go with Me"" and ""Point of No Return""--the originals were much better, which are, thankfully, here as well. A few downers, but mostly a great CD."
3,2 many changes,The original Recording group for Expose not present on this album Lori Ollie and Sandra got the group started then the group was revamped and rerecorded by Jeanette Ann and Gioia they made Expose what it was and is in our hearts at one point for about the year that seasons change was number one Julie Albers took Gioia's place. For a short time after that Gioia went back but eventually she left the group again. The last kiss of death version if you will was Jeanette Ann and Kelly They are pictured on this album yet Gioia is still the voice on many of the leads of this album.. Jeanette had a catchy voice but be assured every time you here a ballsy kick your a** vocal it is Gioia's ..on this CD as well as the previous CD's from Expose you have heard It is worth the listen I just wanted to give You all the facts first. After all I was in the group for a year:)
1,3 Jennifer Lopaz's for the price of lame,how did this group ever blow up in the first place? point of no return&let me be the one are just the same song formula.with the weak take that goes for Latin pop today they would be huge.
4,,"""let Me Be The One"" is the best song on this CD! it hasR&B;/pop appeal it is catchy and the lead vocal is awesome! I luv'd the girl with the dark hair who sings it. She had alot of soul for a white girl. This song got mad airplay on black radio back in the day It takes me back to the 80's and I luv going there.Get the CD and put it on repeat."
5,Expose Greatest Hits,I'm a very big fan of Expose the Greatest Hits CD is an excellent album to own if your a fan of the band all the tracks are really cool the songs sound great.
2,Buy this if you want to reward corporate music,"This cd has none of the original members of Expose. Actually, not even their first album had the original members. Only hard-core Miami natives remember who the real Expose was; Ali, Sandee, and (I forget the third one). I saw them in concert during the fall of 1984 and they blew me away. I visited my local disco record store until they released an album. Guess what, THREE NEW GIRLS. All their original songs were redone. They became famous internationally, but they lost some of their edge. Now, their label disbands the group and is seraching for three new girls. Oh well, deja vu. Strip away the original energy, the original producer, and now you have a bland cd that does not do justice to the magic of Expose of old. I'll go back to listening to my original 12"" records and hope one day, the label will bring back Luis Martinee to write some new songs, and find three new singers with real ""salsa"" in Miami."
1,Kraiburg Rubber Bumper Plates,"The product is fine. The description is very misleading. You show a picture of 2 items and use the word ""plates"" and say the plates weigh 45 lbs each. No where in the purchase process does it indicate I am not buying 2 plates. Only after receiving the shipping notice did I discover that the shipment weighed 45 lbs, meaning I was only getting one ""plates"". I bought the ""plates"" on sale. By the time I discovered I was getting one ""plates"" the sale had ended and I had to buy a second ""plates"" at a higher price. You owe me money."
2,"Harem, a Confused Look at History","Harem wins five stars for book design, and only one for content. Alev Lyttle Croutier obviously spent a tremendous amount of time finding artwork to illustrate her book. However, most of the paintings that she selected are elaborate European orientalist fantasies of Haram life and not actual historicaly relevant pieces. Perhaps Ms. Croutier should have spent a little more time researching her topic. Aside from some pretty staggaring historical mistakes and gross generalizations about Islam, the book contains very little usefull information for scholars. Most of Haram: World Behind the Viel focuses on a single royal Turkish Haram - with very little cross-cultural analysis. If you are interested in orientalist art or detailed descriptions of eunich castration than this is the book for you, but if you are looking for actual scholarship - look elsewhere."
3,"well presented stories, not history","The book was fun and easy to read, in a very well presented format with a lot of colorful pictures. However, it is very ""light weight"" if you are really into history."
4,harem the world behind the veil,This is an excellent account of a world that was amazing and hidden from view for centuries. The details of life in the harem are extraordinary and the author has done thorough research on the subject. Sumptuous surroundings and human cruelty existed side by side. Fascinating reading
2,Mislabeled!!!,"For several years I've been conserving the original windows in my 1890 era house.The paint on the interior woodwork, windows included, had been stripped by aprevious owner. I've been staining the windows and sills and using a marine spar varnish or urethane to provide a robust protective coating. I've just finished treating a third floor palladian window in this fashion. I didn't have quite enoughVarathane from my first purchase to finish so I bought another from the same seller.A satin finish it ain't. Its GLOSSY!! So three segments of window frame are satin finished and one is glossy. Good news,its not in a high visibility location but this can't be the only mislabeled pint out there. Any other Varathane users out there who've been similarly surprised?"
3,New Pianist,"The DGX-500 (purchased via a company on the internet and not via Amazon) was great for the first few months...( even though it never gave the ""grand Piano loudness"").. until the right bank of speakers began to exhibit 'fuzzy' sounds with each strike of any key .. no matter what voice is used. I've tried 'everything' I can think of to correct the situation, to no avail. I suppose the only alternative is to purchase external speakers? Would this rectify the problem? Please, if you have information to help, let me know. Presently, I'm heading to Radio Shack to talk to them about this and get their input."
4,Full of laughs,"I liked this book very well. I think it takes you back to the original Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, in that the ""cures"" are reverse psychology or clear demonstrations, rather than ""magical"" powders and potions. Being with a loving, confident adult works wonders on the children in the stories. This is a good book, and it's fun to read aloud.*** update, October 2009 -- used this for a second grade book report -- perfect!"
5,A Hit With My Granddaughter,"I bought this book for my 8-year-old granddaughter and she loved it. She whipped right through it (but caveat: she reads well above her grade level) and proceeded to get other Mrs. Piggle-Wiggles from the library. This is a book I remember reading over and over again when I was a kid. It's a funny, gentle way to make an impression about behavior and parenting."
1,"Old book without a cover bought for .25, sold it for over $4.00","This reviewer bought this from a library book sale for .25 and sold it to us for over $4.00. I wouldn't have minded if it were in good condition, but it was not. The book was missing a cover and was in very poor condition when we received it. I won't be buying from this buyer again."
4,dionne warwick is truly a diva and again proves it,each cd is a work of art. the lady has still got it and proves that she gets better with age. i can't really say that any cut is better than another. dionne is poised and elegant in her song and in her presence.
3,"YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TRYING, BUT.......","Dionne Warwick is never one to sit back and rest on her laurels. She always pushed and stretches her talent, something I find very admirable. But sometimes we can all go a little too far. This CD is a good example. Although it has a few good moments, in general it isn't very satisfying. Warwick's vocals sound particularly worn and thin on this one, and she doesn't seem to put much effort into sounding her best. Also, some of the arrangements are curious, such as ""Caravan"", among others. Real fans of Dionne should buy her latest album, ""Dionne Sings Dionne."" She sounds rejuvenated and much more enthusiastic, and she is more at home singing HER kind of songs - plus she even does a re-make of Aquarela do Brasil that is far better than the one on this album."
3,I returned it!,"The DGX series do not allow the piano voice to be played loud enough; it can only be heard at slightly less than an average volume when volume dial is turned to ""max."" The problem is that I found myself playing harder to get the touch sensitivity to compensate. I had to decide whether to get an amplifier or speakers, or to return it. The positive reviews about this keyboard are all true. I only gave it three stars because of the volume problem. Every DGX model (200, 300, and 500) have low volume output for the grand piano voice. If you have speakers or an amplifier, than this keyboard is worth every penny. Beware that many other buyers have had the same complaint."
3,I've heard better ones,"Ok this album is probably not the very best of Vasco Rossi.He has done much better in the past. The album is pretty expensive too if you buy it from the outside. But Vasco is Vasco and somehow certain songs may please you. Just remember if you really have no money to spare buy another one like ""Rewind"" or ""Fronte del Palco""."
4,Jazz With Atmosphere,"My experience of jazz enthusiasts is that they are all compartmentalised - they all like one particular instrument or another. You cant do this with this cd, you cant help but enjoy the alto & tenor sax, bass and piano playing. This is one of those good alround jazz albums with that something missing you cant quite put your finger on. Neverthless I always enjoy this one and I when I close my eyes I imagine some smoke filled basement jazz club at midnight - basically its got atmosphere!"
2,best viewed on fast forward,"Well if you have every played a Larp or been in the SCA you are in for a shock. The costuming in our fantasy games are ten times better than the costuming here in westender. Also You tend to see that the world of westender is full of peril. But that is par for the course when your battles are faught with no armour and swords.The acting is along the lines of Xena series one, but the script is paper thin. So it does not matter how good the acting is, their just isn't much to work with.The photography is beaytiful, bet everything else is slow.Rent or get it off of ebay for $5.00 other wise you'll be sorry."
1,"You may die before this movie ends, you will certainly wish you had.","Cast overheard at the first day of shooting:""Hey Dude, let's make a movie.""""Hey, I know a guy with a camera.""""Scene 256, take one""Cast overheard next week after viewing the final cut:""What's an editor?""""What's a script?""""Cool man, it's got pretty colors""A move where you discover the regular fast forward speed is still too slow."
2,Cures insomnia,"This movie is about the Westender, a name applied for no visible reason. Most of what he does is walk.-- Walk through forests with an un-funny jester.-- Walk through forests without the jester.-- Walk through deserts in armor.-- Walk through deserts without armor.-- Meet some really exciting-looking people. The end.I almost forgot - he wakes up, too. He does that a lot of times. Waking and walking, that's about it.//wiredweird"
1,Did everybody else see the same movie I did?,"If I hadn't paid money to rent this dog, I would have turned it off after the first five minutes. It is obviously low-budget, there was no dolby digital, and there was no way to turn off the subtitles. Aside from the blurry photography, the plot was pretty dumb. The dialog didn't fit the times and the acting was pretty lame. I guess I was expecting a movie and I got a ""film""."
5,Beautiful,"My 8 year old and I really enjoyed putting this puzzle. It took us a week at hour stretches at a time. The edge pieces that were difficult to find and hard to distinguish because of shape and color eventually appeared when the bulk of the puzzle was done (2/3 or more), and we ""high-fived"" each other when we finally found the connecting pieces. Yah, the edges could have been a bit easier to find with a brighter color for the outline but all in all, the puzzle is well made and challenging. It also was fun to find the small animals and birds within the larger wolves."
2,nearly impossible,"What a beautiful puzzle--simply gorgeous. But almost impossible to put together for several reasons. The box does not give a clear picture of the true shape of the puzzle. The edge pieces actually have a cream-colored border on some of them that does not show on the photograph. The pieces are cut into various sizes (some way too tiny) which makes an already confusing process even more confusing and the colors of the pieces differ from the colors of the photograph. There are also many pices that are just straight-edged all around and you have no way of knowing where they might fit into the puzzle. What a shame. Like the last reviewer, I am on the verge of giving up."
5,Tear jerker,"This book is rather short, but is well worth the read if you ever meet Dave you would know this book comes from the heart. I enjoyed this and even had a waiting list of people who wanted to read it."
1,This is not a glass carafe,"This was in the Amazon category called ""Glass Pitchers and Carafes"". I received the order immediately, however the carafe is not made of glass - it's plastic. I'm sure it will work fine, but I was expecting glass - not plastic."
2,Almost Quit,"I'm bullheaded and will finish most every book which I did here but came close to putting it down for good.I guess the thing I got out of it was the Chinese thought of ""saving face"" no matter how unredeemable thesituation is."
4,An enlightening perspective on history and religion,"Gore Vidal does a wonderful job bringing the fifth century B.C. to life. Most of the historical material that is available from this time period tells the story from the Greek point of view, though it is likely the Persians thought of Greece in the uncultured and unwealthy way that Vidal portrays. More importantly, the novel presents eastern thought of the period in a very clear, concise manner. Questions are raised not only pertaining to the narrator's Zoroastrian religion, but also pertaining to Buddhism and Confucianism. The benefits and pitfalls of each are described in detail. This is the first Gore Vidal novel I have read, and I will certainly delve into more."
5,One of Vidal's Best - Entertaining and Informative,"Gore Vidal is a master of historically-based fiction. In Creation, Vidal takes us for a hugely entertaining journey into the Persian and Indian empires in great detail. Reading this book provides insight into how people lived back then and how history played out. This book is a great read from cover-to-cover."
1,Buyer Beware!,"There is a problem with the most recent production of the soft cover version of this book. I purchased this version from Amazon a couple of months ago and after reading about 100 pages, I could continue no further. After the first hundred or so pages, the pages are bound wrong. They are all out of order. Amazon replaced the book for me with no questions asked, but the replacement they sent me had the same problem. I went to a local book store to purchase it and... THE SAME PROBLEM! So, if you really want this book, and you do not want to go crazy sorting through the entire novel to find the next page, buy the hardcover version..."
4,Worth a read.,i had to read this book for a history class in college and at first i didn't think it was going to be that good. after i started reading it it turned out to be a good read. it spans all kinds of ancient history starting in Greece and moving through Asia. the main character meets all kinds of historic figures like Buddha.
4,enjoyable read,"Fairly well written, entertaining and interesting read about a fascinating period in history. I recommend this for a summer read or something to read before sleep."
5,The best. Period.,"This has got to be, quite simply, one of the best books ever written. Gore Vidal often takes 50-100 pages to get the characters introduced and the story moving, but not this one...it blasts out of the gate and even for its size, it never lets go. It plumbs the depth of human experience, is probably more educational that any history book on the time, and is never, ever boring. My husband used to read it and start over as soon as he finished it. He even reread it after seeing ""300"" (not the best movie ever made...) to remember what it said about the Battle of Thermopylae. When he found it, he roared with laughter. See if you can find it."
2,Doesn't deliver what it promises,"You don't like a novel written by a legend and immediately, you feel guilty, even stupid. It's like standing in front of a very expensive painting of what looks like vomit marks on a canvas, and the ""art critic"" next to you lectures you on the deep meaning behind such a fantastic artwork.Not that this book is a literal comparison here, but I found it a labor to read. Worse, the promise of the book was a fantasy ""as if"" look at what would happen if all the ideas of the axial age had somehow merged, or at least crossed paths. For years I've thought this an excellent concept for a book, and was delighted when I discovered that somebody had written one. This book is a waste of a fantastic concept. Totally undeveloped. The hero simply meets folks like Confucius and Buddha and basically says hello and goodbye. Not to say the book isn't interesting, just too long. By half."
2,Not up to Gore Vidal's usual standards,"As a Gore Vidal fan I was disappointed in his Creation book. I am a lover of historical fiction but not religion. The page is full of questioning and thoughts of after life, gods, etc. Not my cup of tea."
5,Creation by Gore Vidal,"Creation is a great book. It is written as a novel and is written so that the ordinary person can read it. It is difficult reading and will take quite a while to finish it, but is well worth it. The conversations in this book are not real.but could have been just this way. That's what makes it a ""novel"". Gore Vidal did so much research on this book that it is hard to keep track of it all, but it is factual."
3,Classic story for boys,"Dennis Hazelrig is about 17 when his ship strands on a castaway island in the caribbean. It is a few years after John Hawkins and Francis Drake travelled to the Spanish main to sell slaves, the Elisabethean age, a time of hatred and fighting between the Spanish on one side, English adventurers, French huguenots and cimarrones on the other side. A classic story for boys, full of adventures, some clichés and bias, not surprisingly as it was written more than 100 years ago."
2,Impossible to insert correctly,Even though they were advertised as replacement parts they were hard as the dickens to insert and make work. Finally with great effort they finally got placed into the razors but took too much time.
4,"Great book, bogus (publisher) marketing strategy","I love this series of books, and when I got my Kindle, I was looking forward to re-reading them on the new toy. But I cannot understand why the publisher is releasing the 1st book (Jack the Bodiless) after books 2 & 3, and why books 1 & 3 are $7 but book 2 is $18. That's just absurd. For a book that is over 15 years old, why do they find it necessary to rip off faithful readers? Also, why won't they make Intervention available? Publishers attitudes about e-book marketing are incomprehensible to me. I know, I'm just whining. But really!"
5,the best of the three books,"Diamond Mask is the best of the three books from the Galactic Milieu. It has a fast pace and builds the tension magnificantly, with a noticable role for Unifex, my most preferred character. The end is literaly smashing, and you can't wait to read the third part. Although I've read some reviews that disliked the previews in May's books, I think it attributes to the whole scene and makes you want to read the whole series over and over again. Every time you read the book, you see referrals that you want to check. (Has anyone noticed the mention of Claude from the Pliocene Saga, working on Caledonia with his wife?). All in all, a suprising book."
5,Moving and thought-provoking,"At 145 pages, you can read this in a day, but it will stay with you longer than that. You really experience with the character, Boualem Yekker, the gradual removal of liberties, and his own acceptance of his inevitable death, and feel his pain as you would your own. It is also impossible to read about the threats to the character Yekker and wonder how much was fiction and how much was truth as Djaout suffered from repression before his death. A small but very powerful book -- a powerful voice silenced too soon."
2,Too obviously unfinished,"Although the premise of this small novel is intriguing, especially given current events at a national and world level, The Last Summer of Reason is not worth the time. Yes, the manuscript was discovered after the author's death, which leads to a certain romanticism about him and the work. However, it is still an unfinished, unpolished, unfocused book, badly in need of revision and editing."
5,"Louis Braille, The Boy Who Invented Books For The Blind (Scholastic Biography)",I purchased this book for my son so that me may use it for our homeschool lesson to celebrate Louis Braille and what he has done for the blind community. We will be using it in January and I can't wait to share this book with him.
1,I can't believe someone would read this!!,"I found this book extremely boring and very hard to read. The conversations don't flow and the interaction between characters seems abrupt. In fact, I didn't even finish the book that is how borning it was. Now, I don't normally review every book I read unless I have very strong feelings and this produced a very strong sense of a waste of time!!! Do yourself a favor and get another book. Maybe something by Diane Mott Davidson."
5,Very informative and understanding!,"This book provides extremely helpful information about adjusting to life as an exchange student. It has checklists for packing, tips about avoiding cultural mishaps, personal stories, and the stages of getting used to your temporary home. Everything is easy to find and written clearly. A must have for exchange students!"
3,Exchange Student Survival Kit,"This book ""Exchange Student Survival Kit"" shows too much informations with a few pictures. It makes me bored. I give one thumb up!!!"
5,These guys make beautiful music...,"""Shining Road (both mixes),"" ""Paris and Rome (both mixes),"" ""Lilies (both mixes),"" ""Loved,"" and ""Beautiful Friend"" are the best songs on this beautifully textured and sonic album. Their music has a wonderful quality of sound and musical talent. The singer's voice is just lovely to listen to, the music is heavy, yet soothing, and release as much pain as harder sounding bands, and as yet gives as much joy as bubblegum pop (okay, bad comparison, 'cuz the Cranes could kick the arse of any boy band or pop singer). Anyway, this is probably their best album as far as I'm concerned. If you like good goth music that leaves you in a state of serenity, this is the album to get."
4,Emotionally dissonant sonic adventure,"Euro mood-music of sorts -- not recommended for those unable to handle emotional (sonic) dissonance. ""Lillies"" in particular is a jarring collage of sounds mixed with lyrics conveying emotional distress and confusion. Strong stuff.Multi-textured instrumentation usually leans towards abrasive (industrial overtones), but has slower, more pensive movements as well. There's even a song that could be optimistically classified as ""sunny"" (""Shining Road""). Mechanical drumming style (programmed?) is effective counterpoint to mangled guitar tones with bagfuls of electronic ornimentation thrown in at almost every opportunity. Little or no recognizable lead guitar.Lead singer has high, pinched range (imagine bernadette peters singing) which manages to sound detached, desparate, dismayed, mocking and sad... sometimes all at the same time. Never happy.All in all, a very nice sophmore effort. Haven't listened yet to this band's more recent efforts, but definately intend to..."
3,Pretty Good,One of the best Cranes albums in my opinion. Worth the money if you like the style. I thiink i pad a dollar plus shipping for this disk.
1,Ugh!,"I've seen this band live, and am convinced they're obsessed with fame - that's not going to happen! I hope! It'd be worse than any typical girl band that's all ready popular, only leading music in an even worse direction than some of those bands!"
1,Hopefully this band will stay where it belongs...unknown,"What happened to the power, nuance, sweetness, lush and rare vocals and lyrics, darkness, and beauty of Bic Runga? It got lost, and I pray this band doesn't move up, while unknowns out there deserve more spotlight; this band hardly deserves a listen."
4,"Atmospheric, fun for the most part","Some of the songs are fantastic - those with the beautiful loose-guitar sounds and ethereal imagery ""come this far"", ""loved"" grab me and transport me somewhere else, wonderful. I'll agree that Alison Shaw's voice is an acquired taste, but I just love it."
2,Shag Bag,"Poor quality, made of very soft metal. The handle nearly broke on its first use. Product should have a reinforcement on the inside of the handle."
1,Didn't work,This is my first stage bag. I regret buying this one. I guess I got what I paid for. It is poorly built. I tried it at home and the balls didn't fit... So I had to bring out my toolbox to fix it.Spend a little bit more in a better product.
2,bad item,"second time I have received this item..... first one was had a broken part, this second one I had to tighten the handle down, it was coming off, and I had to use a pair of pliers to bend the tabs at the end of the tube so the golf balls would go into the tube. The quality control stinks!"
1,Didn't work for me,"The first time I used it the supporting structures, which connect the handle to the tube bent. I think that they may have been bent in shipping. The handle, tube and other parts look very well made, but the two supports are very light metal that don't look like they would stand up to any amount of use. I returned the bag and received a refund promptly."
5,Love the bag,"Excellent product, it shipped fast. The construction is sturdy and is able to handle normal usage. I am very happy with it, as it does what is intended"
1,It is crap,"The first one broke after picking up 3 balls. Amazon replaced it fast, free, and easy, but the it is still the same quality. The top handle is secured to a plastic disc inside. It bends if you put too much pressure on it. I would suggest using pliers to fold the prongs that pick up the balls in. It takes less pressure off the handle and you might get it to last a bit longer."
1,Horrible,Horrible do not buy. The ball did not fit into the tube. If you push to hard the handle bends very cheaply made dont waste your time with this.
2,the scam bag,"product came timely but.. not happy!, went to use my intec shag bag for the 1st time and it was able to pick up only half way then I needed to walk to the pavement to pound the golf ball to actually go into the tube, then the bottom end of the bag is what seems to be just cardboard and not working properly. a total waste of my money. This product really stands up to "" you get what you pay for "" and "" if it sounds and looks to good to be true it probably is "" still not happy !!"
5,Shag Bag Review,It saves the back breaking labor of pick up practice golf balls. It holds 90 balls and is inexpensive for the work it saves.
2,Not the real thing,"Very cheap construction! Handle bent w/i minutes of using it. Not nearly as strong as the ""real"" Shag Bag."
3,shagbag,"The product is not sufficient for the price paid. the first product same type fell apart immediately. The issue are the pickup pins at the bottom of the tube very inadequate even the second intech shagbag has inadequate pins. I became frustrated and did not wish to spend time sending back the product. It seems to me that this company is Selling their substandard seconds thru the mail order system. A very inept product by an inept quality control system. Shame on your quality a reference of your companies view of Sales via the internet. You bruise my spirit toward Corporate productivity,Shame on YOU. THIS COMPANY CAN NOTIFY ME ANY MOMENT, VENTUROUS SPIRIT, Thank you for this computer venue."
4,Does what it says,"This was a handy tool to get for me. New to golf, practicing is made easier when I can pick up so many balls without running out of pocket space. Great deal for the price.Unfortunately it is not raccoon proof! As we left ours on the deck so easily accessible for practicing, last year it was shredded by the varmints-now looking for a new one and will probably buy this one again."
3,Very Basic,"I was hoping that this book would explain some of the more advanced features of Front Page 2000 while still explaining the fundamentals of FP2K. Instead, I found the information extremely limited and basic (one of the pages explains how to use a scroll bar at the right of the screen.) The webpage photos shown throughout the book show very basic example pages and the book does not show how to use the program to its capacity. I would only recommend it to first time web designers, but not to anyone who has already used web publishing software before."
2,don't fix what isn't broken,"C+ standing on its own, this album is ok, but nothing compared to earlier releases. Head Clouds was their last authentic release, and Metamorphosis seemed to sink into mediocrity which was the end of their signature sound.Hidden faces seems like they sold out and attempted to mimic a sound that appealed to their initial audience, and in doing so gained some new fans, but alienated those who appreciated their (pre-1993) signature sound."
5,Comfy old friend,"Dipping into a Rumpole book is like putting on a pair of old, comfy slippers on a cold night. I'll always be grateful for the TV series as I'll forever see Leo McKern's craggy face and bulbous nose and the imperious French roll hair do of Hilda. After near demise from a heart attack in the last story, Rumpole reemerges at the Primrose Path nursing home for a long period of rest and rehabilitation, only to be caught up in a dodgy situation with a disappearing patient, a suspicious over night death and a doctor who used to administer care to the criminal classes. A despondent Rumpole reacts to these events like an old warhorse, trumpeting defiance to the Matron and Hilda alike and gallops back into the fray of Chambers. I can only hope that he is never retired and forever stays at this age to delight his readers for years to come."
2,100 pages too long,"This book is a cross between a cozy mystery with a romantic element and a way too tedious reflection on questions of faith mixed with A LOT of palentology lessons. I was a little embarassed for the main character Em, who seemed to have no sense of what sort of man was appropriate for her - first she though George was the man, then Ray, and she was briefly swayed by the strange character ""Earthworm."" Seemed pretty pitiful for a grown woman. Overall, I found that I cared very little for the characters, and about page 290, I was ready to stop reading, even though I was only 40 pages from the end. The exact person who had done the murder was still unknown to me, but I'd figured out the plot, and, unlike the police, I don't have to have every shred of evidence accounted for before I can finger the murderer. I did finish it, but I was speed reading toward the end."
2,Plenty of gossip; little information,"Well, Strathern is certainly entertaining, if not informative. He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, cheap, pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were. A new low in publishing."
5,Wine Top,Schnauzer Gray Uncropped Tiny wine bottle top is just great my wife just loves it. It is priced wright and came in the mail quick.
2,Originally misrepresented in pictures,"I had left negative feedback prior to this. It is obvious the seller changed the title to a new name so that my negative review could not be seen.They misrepresent the number of creatures given. When I ordered them, I was disappointed to only receive the dog. I thought you get all four.With all their animals, they only need to specify that you get one, not the whole group. Not doing this is deceiving the customer."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Memory lost runs in both sides of our families and we wanted to start taking this to help with our minor forgetfullness. It did nothing whats so ever. After watching the Doctor OZ show about memory lost DR. OZ recommended just taking 100mg ginkgo biloba twice a day everyday. Also our local CVS pharmacist said: ""Buying this Natrol menory complex was a waste of money."""
3,Not Great,"Gallian's Contemporary Abstract Algebra is my required textbook for this course. I bought Schaum's Outline to supplement it and help me with some of the proofs. Instead, I found exactly the same worked-out examples from Gallian. My homework problems I was having trouble with were also under the ""extra"" problems section which does not have solutions. Basically this book was useless to me. If you aren't already using Gallian, that's the book you should get; this one would be okay if you want to save a few bucks."
4,Very well explained,"I think this book would be good by itself in picking up algebraic theories and methods. Each section is well explained and the sample problems take you through the process step-by-step.The only problem I have with the book is that not all the supplementary exercises (to test your understanding) have the answers. Some have an answer, some have a partial answer, some have a hint, and some have nothing. This is a little aggravating, but it does not take away from the book."
4,pleased but only to a point,"I really liked this book. It broke down abstract/modern algebra basics very well; however, i thought it would be more detailed about groups (the subject my professor spent much of his time on). It helped with the rules of integers and real numbers and, etc. But I was disappointed with how little of number theory it really covered. I needed to know more about rings and groups and subgroups. If you just need a little help this would be a great book for you. HOWEVER I would suggest looking for a more advanced book if you need information on groups and rings. Good supplementary text, but was not exactly what I thought it was."
3,Average resource,"This was an average resource for me in my advanced algebra course. I suggest if you are to use this book, to also get Joseph Gallian's Contemporary Algebra book as well."
3,"mm, not quite what I was hoping for...","This installment in the Schaum's outline series doesn't do it for me. I had reason to pick this one up simply out of curiousity (and out of habit, by using other titles in this series for other lower-level undergraduate courses). It hardly stimulates any interest on the part of the reader; and the presentation is dry; not to mention that the selection of solved problems wasn't carefully thought out (most, I found, were proofs of some pretty standard results, which I would have rather not seen all over again). And the bare-hands computations weren't all that exciting, either.Ploughing through a course text proper would better serve the serious student of mathematics. There are other well-written books devoted to solved problems in algebra (group/ring theory, for instance). It's just a matter of scoping them out carefully, and dishing out the money (for photocopies, even)."
2,quaint,"As PvR writes, this book is dated. By more than the 40 some years since publication; it has the flavor of a book from the early 1900's; the protestant missionary - tourist in a hundred exotic gardens whose names are mispelled; unsystematic; creationist. The funny tree the ""natives"" called tumbo, properly named for the German who ""discovered"" it and such wonders described in bubbles of enthusiasm for god's menagerie.And yet a quaint book for your bathroom, for a quick contemplative chuckle at peculiarities of nature and at our silly selves. Very like a whale!"
5,Feelin' It,"In 1996, jay-z exploded with this album, or with this masterpiece. He has his own kind of style of rapping about being a hustler. This album shows it, and it is a landmark in hip-hop"
1,bad copy,"On my first listen of the album, I was satisfied until I got up to the second LP where I noticed sides A and B had the same tracks. I've listened to Reasonable Doubt dozens of times and I usually happy to hear songs like 'Cashmere Thoughts' and 'Regrets' on repeat, but to give me a copy without 'Can I Live'... c'mon. To say the least I was disappointed, not specifically about the album but the fact that I received a lemon."
5,Jay-Z Is The Greatest you can't hate on him,"I am a big fan of Jay-Z. When i First got this album last year it took me a day to like it. My Favorites are Dead PresidentsII, Coming of Age, Bring it on, and, Regrets. This had to be the best Jay-Z Album before Hard Knock Life, Blueprint, And Gift and curse. All you haters stop hating and try to study his album instead of hating"
5,Jay Z Reasonable Doubt,"If you don't have this one you should get it. This is HOVA in his raw'est form, and if you are a fan of pure hip hop before the dirty south mess'ed it up then you must get this cd."
5,Light years ahead of its time!,"BOTTOM LINE:Flows so futuristic, that it took nearly a decade for others to catch on and push this past platinum status. So far ahead of its time in terms of lyrics, content, flow and delivery - that The Source had to apologize years later and give it 5 Mics! Songs like 'Dead Presidents', 'Brooklyn's Finest' and 'Can't Knock the Hustle' are now considered all-time anthems.That pretty much says it all.A+ another hiphop Essential"
2,be real,"there was a reason people weren't buying this album when it came out, it just wasnt that good. dont get me wrong it has its gems but as a overall record its just average, what lacks mostly is the production the beats are lackluster and bland, when listening to the album u feel like u hear the same thing over and over. besides a few stand outs its rather lame, check out his second album thats were he shines and the production and skill meet"
5,Jay-Z's Best,"It has been five years since this album was released and it is still better than most of the albums that have come out since it's debut. Any true hip-hop head would agree that this was Jay-Z's best album and he has yet to match the lyrical intensity of this album. This is not to say that everything that he released later has not been good. Maybe it's just that the lyrics on tracks like D'Evils and 22 Two's are nothing short of masterpieces and fans like me have been left amazed to the point that we cannot accept anything less than the brillance Jay-Z displayed on these songs, as well as other songs on this album. My favorites are: Can't Knock The Hustle, Brooklyn's Finest, Dead Presidents, Regrets and 22 Two's. Want to know why so many fans think of Jay-Z as one of the greatest of all-time? Give this album one listen(two or more, for those of you that didn't catch the wordplay on the first listen)."
5,I CANT STAND JAY-Z . . .,"and everything he stands for . . . .Brand name this brand name that, biting Biggie, grown man still talking about slinging, the list goes on.But this album is flawless!"
5,Classic,"Jay-Z's first, and perhaps best album, starts out like all of his album, with a man with a funny voice talking and a great intro. The intro tracks on all of Jay-Z's albums havehis best verses ""Can't Knock the Hustle"" is no different. In fact on this whole CD there is not one song which still in 1998 does not spend time in my CD player."
2,If it sounds like a DUCK...,"There were only about two songs that really spoke as if they were sung with true heart. It's not because I can't relate to the meanings or the words, but because they're mostly sung without feeling; just a movement of the lips. Almost without knowledge of true survival skills. Can't wait to hear the new release! I hope my support is conquered."

2,I am a collector of of classic albums!,"I collect classic albums from different genre's of music and try to listen to and understand the reasons why the people consider them masterpieces!I listened to almost all the hip-hop classics around, and ""Reasonable Doubt"" is just so dry and uninspiring! Jay-Z's lyrics are strong, but production wise, I just couldn't get a classic vibe from it! I also didn't feel like it had replay value, which is a masterpiece characteristic! Jay-Z' ""Blueprint"" and ""The Black Album"" has more of a classic feel which is much more enjoyable than this sub-par performance."
4,HOTness 4 ever...,"I think this is Jay's second best album, Vol. II: The Hard Knock Life is my all time favorite. I didn't here this till 1998, I thought it was okay, the beats were nothing new. But when I bought it, I really sat back and listened to it and realized his flow on every track is what makes this a classic. If he didn't have the skill he has to record this album, he never would have been as big as he is right now. I do feel though that this album is his realest, from the heart, no bull talk. Every body his lived through or wanted or experienced something he rhymes about, and that's what makes the difference. You need to be felt by your audience, and he went with what he felt, it's not always a good outcome when that happens, but when he did it, he made millions of fans. Props to Jay for what he done in the game, some people might not get this, but i Feel his pain..."
5,gigga at his best,simple as the if you have been disapointed by his latest but liked vol 2 you will love this
5,Unreasonably Great,"this is by far jay-z's best album and it includes some of the best songs he has ever made.My Top 51. Dead Presidents II2. Can't Knock The Hustle feat. Mary J. Blige3. Feelin' It feat.Mecca4. 22 Two's5. Politics As UsualIf you like rap, you will love this album"
3,overaTed,this isnt that good isnt that hood best song = cant knock the hustle hey i hustle okkk? ima cool guy i am lil chubby i am spanish too but ey i could eat more than u so haahah skumbagz
2,The most overrated rapper of all time,"Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated. I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him. His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again. He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars. Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck. I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.Best tracks on this album:Can't Knock the HustleBrooklyn's Finest w/BiggieDead Presidents"
1,not a classic,"I don't know why everybody is saying that this album is a classic, it's not even close. Nas' Illmatic was a classic, 2pac's Me Against the World was a classic, not this. This album is Jay-Z's best work and that's the sad thing about it. Jay-Z isn't as good as everyone makes him out to be. He's just like everyone else, listen to his lyrics, there's nothing special about them. Eminem is the greatest rapper alive, sorry Jigga."
4,Great Debut from Hova (4.5 stars),"Jay-Z drops some fire for his debut album. One of his best works he's done. Features a few classic trax but is just short of a 5 star rating if you ask me. Features a 18 yr. old Bleek as well as a 17 yr. old Foxy Brown as wll as his neighborhood homie Sauce Money and a classic w/ Notorious B.I.G. (R.I.P.). Definitely worh pickin' up. The best tracks are:#1#3 (a classic featuring B.I.G. (Rest In Peace)#'s 8 & 11 (f/ a young Memphis Bleek)#9 (f/ a young Foxy Brown)#12#13 (f/ Sauce Money)Shawn Carter - b. 12/4/69 -- Marcy, Brooklyn, NYP.S. - check all my reviews"
4,james bond of rap game what!,"Jigga is hot. Or at least he was back in the day, at the times of REASONABLE DOUBT. Starting off with ""cant knock the hustle"", a dope track with jay-z's godfather type flow and top lyrics, and then #5, ""feeling it"", also a dope track. You know the feel, when for example MJ entered the court in the NBA finals a fev years back, seeing that made every hair in your body rise, and it gives you the chills like it was winter. ya'll aint know? Well, this album delivers that exact same feel. The only downside is that the album keeps gettin worse near the end, but that doesnt bother. i'd pay the full price for the first 10 tracks. Buy this cut. Tell yourself: ""im worth it"". i was."
5,every track is ill,if u dont own this ur stupid its hovas finest work ive seen him in concert and wish he did more old skool tracksrob (UK)
4,Too much Jay Z d*#k lickin.............,"Let's set the record straight - This album was slept on in 1996 for a reason. Pac, Nas, The Fugees,Biggie and Junior Mafia ran 96. Most people I know didnt pick up Reasonable till 97. Even the Source gave this album a 4 based on the fact this joint talked a lot about the materialistic subjects that Biggie and Pac had already blew up. Now onto the biggest question that plagues Jay-Z's career.Would he have been as big if the tragedy did not occur in 96 and 97. Maybe, Maybe not. All I know is that when Jay first came out he was a small fish in a big pond, and did not really break until 2 of the biggest fish were gone.As for being the greatest MC of all time - It takes much much more to actually start the fire than it takes being a great torch carrier."
1,VERY WEAK ALBUM!!!,This album is one of the weakest albums in all of music history.This overrated and weak rapper steals nas's style and the beats are just boring.Same old tired lyrics and production.There is only one song worth listening to.People should just accept the fact that hip hop is headed to the grave and heavy metal will once again rule the world.HEAVY METAL RULES FOREVER!!!
5,A CLASSIC!!! that should be in every rap collection,"From the intro to the last song on the cd Jigga in his realest form ever, rips it with a style and class that is absent in the rap game today. Every song laced with lyrics that make this cd one of the best rap cd's produced, EVER!! There's no sugar-coating or trying to crossover in this ablum. Its precise and to the point, the real s***. This is a must have cd."
5,Do not doubt this album,I don't like Jay Z as a rapper and this CD is still a classic. Thats saying alot!How come I don't hear people talking about Reasonable Doubt much though?
5,"J . A . Y. is ""Feelin it""","This man Jay-Z is straight snappin on this album. First track # 8 ""Can I Live"" is the BOMB no doubt,cause that man got the old school jazz beat from issac hayes, and just flipped the scriped. Then i want to give madd props for ""Dead Presidents II"" That man jigga was going off... LONG AS THE VILLIN WIN I SPEND YA PEN YEAR IN A TEN MAJOR EVENTS CATCH ME IN THE JOINTS CONVINCE MY AGUANAS IS BITEN J. A. Y (hyphen) CONTROLIN MANIBULAT AND I GOT A GOOD LIFE MAN....... if you get a chance peep ""In my liftime"" (remix) from the movie and soundtrack ""Streets is Watching"" he just blew up off that. Peace out from ""Roy"" East Moline, IL"
4,The First Will Always Be The Best,"Reasonable Doubt released in 1996....showed the world a hungry Shawn Carter....very few knew him from a verse he did on Original Flavor's ""I Got Cha Open"". As the first artist off the freshly christened Rocafella label, Jay-Z became Brooklyn's best representative overnight....his lead off single ""Ain't No N***a"" destroyed the air and radiowaves shared alongside femme fatale Foxy Brown. At first listen, you knew that Jay-Z was destined for greatness. Reasonable Doubt enlisted memorable guest appearances, and the lyrical prowess of Jay-Z made this an instant classic....even though 10 years later, I don't agree that Jay-Z still possesses the same lyrical greatness that caused him to skyrocket to the top of hip hop, this album will always remain in my steady rotation. To all of you youngsta's out there, don't claim that Jay-Z is a legend until you hear how it all started first."
1,Overrated Debut album,Many jay-z fans dont even know this jay-z album exist. It's overrrated just like his other work. Not Recomended.
1,Too bad I can't give it 0 stars!,Anyone who gives this garbage album more than 1 star is a moron who probably has to move his/her lips when he/she reads a book!Nas is the best and Jay Z is the worst!
1,Trash,"This is one of Jay-z's most worst of all baddest attemps.Because he still onces to Try to be big but garbage when nas trashed him and the ROC.It's good he retired.nas worked his Ass off more than this clown with D*** Suxinlips,the main reason cause nas' debut album lllmatic wasthe best album of all time,Now on the other hand Jay-z's debut,this crappy work he had to re-release this album like 3 times in a row for it to go platinum,come on nas puthis record out once 11 years ago and it will be talked about for years to come just like Ready To Die."
1,Overrated trash!,"Jay Z may very well be the wackest rapper who has ever walked God's Earth! He truly has no wisdom about the 5% nation and the truths inherent within the 5% Nation. He lacks the wisdom that would enable him to look at things from his ever-present third eye. In fact, one might even claim that Jay z, and those of his ilk, are promoting slander in the air-time with this trash!Peace to the Gods!"
1,Not as good as his other garbage!,"Jay Z been wack, son!Jay Z been exposed for bein mad soft, son!The Gods been knowin Jay Z wack, dunn!Thank God Jay been retired!Yall aint been knowin!"
1,Thank God he retired,"Every one of Jay Z's albums have been complete trash. Jay Z is the wackest rapper of all time, even worse than 2pac. Jay Z was nothing more than a fake, an absolute joke who got ripped apart by Nas so badly that he cried and cried and had to retire. ""Reasonable Doubt"" is a piece of crap just like every one of Jay Z's albums!"
1,"NO, NEVER....","WILL THIS BE A CLASSIC, IT WAS GARBAGE WHEN IT CAME OUT.. DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THE RUDE BOYS HIP HOP REMIX FOR 'MY KINDA GIRL'? YES, JAY Z WITH HIS NO STYLE BITING DAS FX AND CHRIS CROSS/WRECKS-N-EFFECTS MIGGIDY MIGGIDY LYRICS... HA HA PLEASE STOP.. AND WAKE UP FROM THE ONSLOT OF ADS THAT TELL YOU THIS CRAP IS HOT ........ YALL GOT PLAY'D!! LOL ANND SEE, I WOULD BE CALLED A HATER.. YES I HATE WACKNESS...!! STOP STOP LYING ... THIS IS NO CLASSIC... KIDS DO NOT , I REPEAT DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!NO STARS!!!ONELOVE"
1,horrible,rap sucks and so does jay-z. i'm glad he retired and all the other rappers need to retire too.
2,Of Ghosts and Angels,"Not a real page turner.. Love and other mundane letters compiled into a book. I bought the book after reading a short story by the author ""A Legacy from Mr. Ditto"" .... this was an awsome short story."
2,Disappointed,"It was great to see the Bob the Builder videos come out in DVD format.. but we were disappointed with this DVD. No new shows, no extra items on DVD (games, etc), and NO menu! It's just a VHS format put on a DVD."
4,"Typical ""Bob the Builder""","Basic ""Bob the Builder"" video. If your kids are Bob the Builder nuts... then they will love this video! If not, then they will probably watch it a couple of times, but not ask for it. You always know what to expect with Bob the builder (always age appropriate with good life lessons on recycling, sharing and teamwork). Appropriate for any age (mine are 3 and 5)"
4,Can you dig it?,"My 2 1/2 year old can. I personally don't see the attraction to any of the Bob the Builder videos, but we watch this one every Friday Night. There is something about how Bob shouts ""we won!"" that really appeals to my son. I'm glad the stories are now being released on DVD and this one is more enjoyable than Pets in the Pickle."
3,Curl vs cURL,"Need to be sure that this book represents what you want. I did not realize that there were two kinds of 'curl'. Actually, I erred - really wanted cURL functions."
4,WONDERFUL!!! BLESS ALL THE LORDS OF KOBOL!,"I am really enjoying these new Battlestar Galactica books. I always loved the show and the intricate and well though out plots (at least the first half of the season). And these books seem to continue in this same vein. The characterizations and connections are intricate and moving. I have always wondered what might have been. Richard's ability to keep things exciting and intriguing is wonderful. I had only one nit. In the book, Rigel is characterized as a man -- in the TV show he was a she. (The girl who always got that great line, ""You may launch when ready."" I can't wait for the next installment. May the Lords of Kobol bless and keep you, Richard!"
3,Like the second part of a trilogy,I was hooked reading this book until the very end. It also seemed as if it was finished early with so many storylines left hanging. Preferred the first book overall but will definately read the third if/when it is published. Good to see the books written in a similar fashion to the original TV series.
3,"Not as good as the first book in the Series, but readable","I think this book went a little too much into the psi- thing and too little into the Cylons. There is a lot of action, but I wish that the storyline had been developed a little more."
1,A long-time fan,"I've been a fan of BG ever since it first came out, but I'm sorry, Mr. Hatch, I couldn't wade through this novel (and I tried, believe me). This whole psi-power thing, with its elitist overtones, is not a good selling point for long-term fans of the series. Your treatment of Starbuck (the character that still sells BG) rings a little hollow and is not calculated to endear him to anyone. Please stop here."
1,Battle(stunk)star Galactica,"BAD. Bad. Bad! Richard, come down from orbit and get a grip ... I am not much of a Sf person, but, all the mind stuff is bad for a book. Stick with the Cylons."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Hatch and Golden have given Galactica fans a book they will truly appreciate. They've captured the best part of the TV series, continued the magic, and even improved upon it in some cases. Warhawk rocks!"
3,yes!!!,a much better effort than the first book armaggedon makes you wish that the tv series had done these sorts of stories rather than the guns of navarone rip off and the western gun slinger episode the writing is a bit basic using horrid as a word is not one i would normally read in any novel felt abit like a famous five kids story still it did improve on the first one giving valor abit more depth looking forward to reading the third one
1,"boring ""soul"" again",".Too many boring soul ballads !I hate ""soul"" at all!Although Taylor Dayne sings not just those stupid ballads, her compilations include them mainly.."
5,Greatest Hits,"This album features all of Taylor Dayne's Greatest Hits. Featured in this Greatest Hits is Top Ten Hits ""Tell It to My Heart"" ""With Every Beat Of My Heart"", ""I'll Be Your Shelter"", The Number 2 hit ""Don't Rush Me"", and her lone Number 1 Hit ""Love Will Lead You Back"". This is a great collection for the Taylor Dayne fan or someone just discovering Taylor Dayne."
2,A little disappointed,"There were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum. I can see doing maybe one song, two different ways. However, there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same!"
3,Not Even Close,"I truly cannot understand what goes through the heads of Music Executives these days. This so call Taylor Dayne's ""Greatest Hits"" don't even come close to what we could call her true hits. Has anyone ever listen to that golden voice? I mean when she performs...""Where does that boy hang out""?, or ""Do You Want It Right Now""?, or ""Want Ads""? or ""Carry Your Heart""? and that's just from her first CD, not taking into consideration her popular hits that we all know. To this day I know about good singers but none comes even close to Taylor, not even Anastacia. Really, if they wanna have a greatest hits for Taylor Dayne, the best the could do is take all her four, yes four albums (forgive me...I meant CDs) and package them in one, them we could talk about her greatest hits, plus, as a bonus they can include ""Original Sin"" written by my all time favorite writer ""Jim Steinman"".LOVE YOU TAYLOR...CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE"
3,Very Average CD,"Was not highly impressed. I only listen to a few songs, and that isnot with any regularity. And, besides...where is she recordingtoday?? Nowhere I know of."
2,More of the same...,"Taylor Dane has topped the US pop, dance and adult contemporary charts.But the real test for blue-eyed soul is the US R&B; chart. A single song that peaked at number 21?She is just another blonde babe with a decent if indistinguishable voice (but she sure does look good in those videos, doesn't she?).For the real goods, check out Lisa Stansfield or Teena Marie."
5,"To me, THE BEST","I know Richter and Rostropovich very well. I own recordings of both. I also know (and own) recordings of Beethoven's Cello Sonatas by other duos.I must say, Richter and Rostropovich are superior. Nobody so far can match Rostropovich's soaring and glorious cello-playing, also in Brahms."
2,CozWiz,"For a movie based on a car...it was very pedestrian (no pun intended). I'll refer any car enhtusiasts to ""Drive' with Ryan Gosling."
3,Odd Odd film,"I dont regret the film, I am just left not knowing what was real and what was all in his head and how to tell the two apart."
5,Great!!,"I saw it, and it was amazing! Plus my best friend Jackie was in it (she plays mary)and she was great at her role!!! This movie was intese and quite unique! - Chris :)"
5,Trance Nation volume 5,"Trance Nation 2001 is the 5th and latest TN title from Ministry. I was looking forward to getting this one and i am glad i wasn't dissapointed. Sure its fairly expensive, but it is an import with 32 tracks on two cds. More then enough to keep you dancing for at least a few months. now I must say on a whole these two discs have some premium tunes. The best dance cd of 2001? yes."
1,Not 100% Acetone,This is not 100% Acetone as stated on the front of the bottle. This also contains denatonium benzoate. Do not waste your money.
5,Great!,"Gets the paint off with no problems, great product. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who restores shoes and wants to get into repainting."
4,Acetone.,A very good organic solvent a cleanser. It works great on my nail polish and does an excellent job at cleaning up other messes.
1,Acetone home use,"I would not recommend this for the normal finger nail polisher......it should be used only in beauty shops because it is very strong and ""melted"" the plastic I had it in which I used to ""soak"" my shellaced nails off. Then afterwards there is the disposal which I still don't know how to properly do that."
5,Capture NX,"I'm a longtime Nikon shooter and have been using Photoshop CS2 for editing(ACR) for RAW files. Capture NX has some significant advantages over PSCS2 for the photographer (it doesn't contain a lot of features that the average amateur hobbyist photographer seldom uses).For example it can save edited JPEG images as NEF (RAW) images, and has a new innovative Control Point technology that allows easy adjustments both global and local.It does, however, lack healing or cloning tools. It contains several examples of using NX in practice.Dr. Odell's eBook is an excellent overview and guide to NX and I found it extremely helpful. If you are new to NX or seriously considering using it, I highly recommend it. In addition, I have seen Dr. Odell respond to questions and to clarify some issues on the popular photographic website DPReview."
2,If used right it can save you money,"The entire book was almost useless to me as I don't play the miniature game and only use the maps for actual star wars role playing. But in each mission book there are a small set of tiles which include various things that are hard to come by in the miniature game. Such as AT-ST walker, Hailfire Droids, The three creatures from Episode 2 in the combat arena, lots of debris and terminals. Although the books are exspensive I can easily copy the tiles now that I have them and keep doing to making the money I spent on the books cheaper than acquiring the mini's"
4,A very decent book,"It won't take you very far, but after 3 months of regular reading, I could communicate in Icelandic. A pity there is no volume II."
2,don't trust Amazon's product details,"There are several editions of this book. Although Amazon shows a colourful front page image for the 1980 edition and claims it had 208 pages, it is not true. What they sent me is a small blue book with 190 pages which is a reprint of the 1961 edition."
5,Tastes like the cheesy popcorn in Christmas tins,"except it's hot. We really enjoyed it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was impressed how evenly coated the cheese was... I wasn't sure how that would work. I think just about everybody knows what the cheesy popcorn tastes like from Christmas tins. This tastes a whole lot like that. The kids loved it."
1,A complete and utter waste of time...,"I was sadly subjected to a view of ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" this weekend and must say that the film is only remarkable in that it has the ability to completely stop the passage of time for the poor souls who are forced to watch it.The dialogue is ludicrous, the camera-work is the very ""best"" that a student film shot with a camcorder held by a person with a nervous twitch has to offer, and the plot so meandering and pedantic that the script must have been penned by an overly-caffeinated chimpanzee with ADD.This is the worst type of indie film-- one that is full of pretentious monologues by ""overly clever"" characters on the meaning of life and the complexity of existence. The entire premise of the film comes down to two words: ""be cool.""Seriously-- avoid this film at ALL costs! You can NEVER get the time spent viewing it back again."
5,"Outstanding, very lively","Mr. Mailer has done a great job on Picasso's early years. He has done solid research, knows the paintings and the personalities in Picasso's life very well. PP's relationship with Braque is presented clearly, the life in Paris in the early part of the century is well told too. Overall, a lively and entertaining read, much livelier than the door jam books of John Richardson."
1,Americanism can rot even the most lucid minds,"A message from Europe to poor Norman Mailer : ""L erreur est la legende douloureuse"" Lautreamont"
5,Gary Stewart is a timeless country singer,"From the Nashville formula days of ""Drinkin' Thing"" and the haunting 'williamson County"" through the cover of Ramblin Man all the way to the bluesy ""Little Junior"" Stewart has provided listeners with a cornucopia of great hits. Any thing this man does is great. Albeit that he is not a traditional c/w singer, Gary has always managed to come back and knock your socks off and with this new release, he has done just that. Pop this CD in, grab a cold one, and prepare yourself for the essential ""Whiskey Trip"". Gary rides again!!!!"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME,"IT'S GREAT TO HEAR SOME VINTAGE GARY.CHECK THIS CD OUT.THE KING OF HONKY TONK HAS TWO WINNERS HERE AT A GREAT PRICE.NOW IF ONLY THEY WOULD RELEASE ""YOUR PLACE OR MINE"" AND ""LITTLE JUNIOR"" ON A TWO FOR ONE COLLECTION.GARY IS IN FINE VOICE AND GREAT TRACKS.BUY THIS DISC."
5,Good Entertainment for Kitchen Clean Up,Listening to Fern's writing makes the clean up time go by quickly. I was glad to find these stories on cassette.
2,Disappointed,"The quality of the brass in this skimmer is very poor, especially where it wraps around the handle. There are sharp ends that can get caught on other utensils, clothes, hands, etc. The bamboo handle is very lightweight and quite rough. The hole in the handle is way too small to hang it up anywhere in my home. It is made by Fox Run and I do not recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality brass skimmer like you see on the cooking shows."
3,Stark gothic rock,"Blade Fetish went on and evolved into the more known Trance to the Sun, but before TttS there was Blade Fetish. It starts with a take on the classic nonsense poem Jabberwocky set to a second wave goth tone. Very fun to listen to. The haunting voce carries you through above average 90's goth. Nothing spectacular, but a rare and obscure piece of the late hey-day of doom and gloom."
5,A ballisticians best friend!,"As a ballastician, I must say that this book is a MUST HAVE for any professional in the field of exterior ballistics or the enthusiast with some knowledge of basic physics and high level mathematics. McCoy was a world renowned expert in the field of exterior ballistics throughout his 30 year career with the US Army Ballistic Research Lab (BRL) - this comes through in the pages of this book without a doubt. There are many excellent examples taken from McCoy's (and others) work with the BRL. All should take note, the book has many small typos peppered throughout both the text and figures. The errata pages can be printed off of several well maintained websites which can be found by searching on the title of the book."
4,ADVANCED Ballistics. NOTHING LESS.,"Who this book is intended for: Physicists. Who this book is not intended for: gun enthusiast looking to improve their shooting skills and/or gain a basic understanding of ballistics.With that being said, I'm sure it's THE amazing book on Exterior ballistics my fellows rave about... however, my eyes were bigger than my stomach. MUCH bigger. :(I'm a graduate student (unfortunately not in physics) and could only hope to skim the text. The real pearls are hidden for only those who speak rich mathematical language (ie. would you rather read a page full of equations instead of text?) Now that I have this book all I need is a lab, 30+years in ballistic analysis, and +20-50 IQ pts...I'd recommend several texts before this for the gun enthusiast:Understanding Firearm Ballistics;With Winning in Mind: The Mental Management System;Hatcher's Notebook, Revised Edition (Classic Gun Books Series)Rifle Accuracy Facts"
3,Better wait the Dover edition,"This is a great book, but full of typos and edition errors of all types.The errata ( you can find it in Internet ) is 20 pages long.The book, as it stands now, is of very limited use.Better wait the Dover edition."
4,Comprehensive and Authoritative,"Great book. Very thorough treatment of the subject. I only wish that a second edition would be published with eratta included (the author died just after completion and the prepublication copy was not adequately reconciled to the manuscript, thus there are a lot of errors at time of publication). Don't let this fact deter you from buying the book. The eratta have been compiled and are available online here:[...]"
4,A Tour de Force work of the James River Squadron,"Much has been said about the CSS Virginia (ex-Merrimack). Much less has been said about the naval operations in Virginia waters after her demise. ""Capital Navy"" fills a previous void in Civil War naval history with well-researched and very readable text, with the added bonus of fine illustrations by David Meagher. An excellent work, all the way around."
2,Not good for soup,"The bowls are too thin and shallow to suit us as soup bowls. It doesn't appear they would hold the soup heat in. They might make a good salad bowl, however."
5,the golden voice boy,The CD has a little bit that 80's sound (typical drumsound) and that's good. It suits the music well. The boy has a nice voice at its best in the higher notes but overall astonishing. The forró-styled tracks are the best I ever heard. The booklet has the text included so you can read what he sings (it's sung in brazilian Portuguese) and even the layout of the CD and booklet are a work of artistry. Hats off to this one.....
4,New book for reference,"If you live in the U.S.A., this will become one of your reference books, no matter if you are hispanic or not."
3,Spanglish is only the beggining of the end,"Spanglish is just a transient phenomenon. The descendants of those who speak it will most likely speak only english. I can immagine the celtic people living under Roman rule, speaking a corrupt and decaying celtic (and all of us know latin substituted totally celtic in Western Europe). I can immagine the mozárabes in Spain under sarracen rule; speaking in a romance language with increasingly more and more arabisms (in both the syntax and lexicon). When the cristian armies finally Reconquered the kingdom of Granada, only a few romanisms in the local dialect of arabic where the remnants of it.Sadly, those who do not have the will to preserve the purity of a language, won't preserve it at all."
2,A bit disappointed,"I must clarify that I have only read a bit of the book, but I must say I'm disillusioned that a particular kind of ""Spanglish"" was not mentioned in this tome. I'm talking about the one spoken by the Mexican middle-class. Unlike the Chicano version, MMC Spanglish recognize English and Spanish grammar rules and only creates a hybrid word when there is not a convenient one in the original language. Thus, an MMCS speaker would say ""bajar"" instead of ""downloadiar"" and would take care to say ""forwardear"", not ""forwardiar"", as Spanish grammar demands.MMC Spanglish represents, for Mexican society, an equivalent of what Franglais represents to the U.S. Northeast. It is a pity that it has been overshadowed by the popular, degenerated version."
1,The justification to speak bad spanish,"The justification to speak bad Spanish for the lazy people who does not want to make more effort to learn and want everything in the easiest way.The introduction of the book is interesting but I totally disagree with the author. Spanglish is not a new language, it is just the incomplete Spanish filling the gaps with English in Spanish. It is not consistent to create a dictionary, every community and almost every individual creates its own ""words"" based on the deficiencies of their own vocabulary. The dictionary may be useful in one area of USA and totally useless in another.My advise is: learn the real thing and not waste your time learning a transitory vocabulary that is going to change from person to person."
2,Tries to do too much,"If you're looking for one stop book on everything Austin, then this might help. For us, it tried to cover too many areas, and lacked personality. We're in the market for a new book."
5,Verdigris Birdbath,"Although plastic, the birdbath looks like the real thing. It is a nice size for a small garden. Easy assembly. I'm happy with it."
4,"Not a comedy, but a very good movie","The sex stuff did not bother me in the slightest. It might have if it were someone I knew in real life rather than a movie, but, then, that is what movies are for. Movie was interesting and moving exploration of odd corners in the abstract interior space of the human condition."
3,Goldthwait's tender side,"For a film from Bob ""Bobcat"" Goldthwait, there is a sweet, human warmth underlying the story, which may be somewhat surprising for those more familiar with ""Windy City Heat"" and ""Shakes the Clown"". Shot on a budget more suited to a student's senior project, with help from Goldthwait's and producer Marty Pasetta's friends, borrowed equipment, props and wardrobe, and often on ""found"" locations, and in HD video, there is a feeling to the film that the intent was to get this film made, even if it never even made to to DVD or theaters. Goldthwait mentioned, in his remarks at the screening at Sundance 2006, that he expected to be showing this to his friends at home, not as a selection for the drama category.Melinda Page Hamilton carries the film, portraying her character, Amy, deftly and eliciting sympathy and understanding from the viewers. Jack Plotnick, playing her tweeker brother, provides the tension and the undercurrent of family dynamics required to clarify Amy's persona."
4,Pretty Good Compilation,"This album has a few really good songs on it. Some of it is a bit odd, like ""Death By Stereo"", but it doesn't ruin the album. I don't know anybody who has this music, so if you want to be original, go for it."
2,Gets Old Fast,"""Another Night"" is one of my favorite songs. I like ""Run Away"" as well. Aside from those 2 songs, the rest of this CD is monotonous. All the songs sound alike to me. None of them stand out at all."
4,This information might have been lost for good,"Robert Charroux personally investigated and researched hundreds of cases and sites stamped ""unexplained"" or conveniently forgotten by science. Using a simple mathematical reasoning, he makes an astonishing demonstration as to why the number of stone tools we found demonstrate that there was no prehistoric period as we imagine it. His interpretation of ancient scriptures may be a stretch in my opinion, but the ""forgotten"" facts and artefacts which he brings back to attention make this book, and the entire series, an irreplaceable addition to any library concerned with ""real"" history."
3,Tank bib,"Tank bib is nice, but the pouch is a little large, hard to determine size of pouch in the picture. Overall, it is worth the money."
1,doesnt fit most vehicles,product did not fit and no size information was available on the product description! I own a toyota truck and it did not fit. looks good but again it has a weird thread pattern
5,Her best album,"This album is Carly Simons masterpiece. It should not be missed by anyone who already loves her music, and it would be a great introduction for the uninitiated. It is at times funky, sweet, sad and lusty and her voice has never sounded better."
4,Dear Carly: Wonderful CD,"This CD is one of the most cohesive CDs Carly has done for quite some time. Like a River flows with sound and lyric, the addition of music from her opera is very fitting. This CD stands out from her other resent releases. Coming Around Again, may have had the hits on it, but overall wasn't consistent. I recommend this CD highly."
4,CARLY GOES POSTAL,"LETTERS NEVER SENT is one of Ms. Simon's most personal albums. She tackles issues of lost love, infidelity, even death. Son Ben Taylor even shows up on one of the short ""interludes"" called ""Time Works on All the Wild Young Men"". Carly sings her heart out and her co-production with Frank Fillipetti provides great support for each song. Her ""signature"" of ""Love comma Carly"", while coy, is a nice finish. While all of the songs don't work for me, there are some good tracks: the frantic LETTERS NEVER SENT; the mood switches of LIKE A RIVER; the poignant TOUCHED BY THE SUN; the global infection of HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD; the seductive urgency of THE REASON and the pathos of BORN TO BREAK MY HEART.Carly has had a long, sometimes uneven career, but has been a potent creative career as one of pop's foremost composers. LETTERS is a commendable, if imperfect, inclusion of Simon's prolific catalogue."
3,Ok Cd,This was a gift for my mom. She was happy with it but as a big Carly Simon fan she said it was not as good as other CDs.
4,Enjoyable listening,"I mostly bought this for the song Touched by the Sun, which is awesome and worth the price of the CD along. There are a few other very good tunes on here, and the whole thing is enjoyable to listen to."
5,"Taste, and see if this is good","Let me quibble first and say this might have been called 'Rumi, poet of the heart's longing for the everliving presence', although the dervish on the cover might clue us that transcendental ecstasy is being offered.All involved in the making of this, please take a bow; accept my gratitude.You have the light that Rumi left here, more intensely says Deepak Chopra, than others have done,certainly than other poets have.Some have recommended this to those who love Rumi; I suggest this more for those who are not familiar with Rumi; they have a possibility of great gain from this. See it at least twice and then ask yourself what you love."
2,What about Rumi?,"Since I heard an NPR special about the poet Rumi, I was interested in this DVD so I might learn a good deal more. Instead, it seemed to be much more about the people who were ""into"" Rumi than the poet himself. While the poetry was very insightful, the staging and presentation was more important."
2,Rumi,"I found it boring and it wasn't a documentray, but people babbling. Deepak made some good valid points, but that was about Rumi."
1,DRECK,"THE ONLY REASON I AM NOT RATING THIS VIDEO LOWER IS BECAUSE 0.01 IS NOT AN OPTION. AT 0.69 PER COPY, THIS VIDEO IS WAY OVERPRICED. THIS IS FAR AND AWAY THE STUPIDEST MOVIE THAT HAS EVER BEEN MY MISFORTUNE TO SEE. EVERY CLECHE THAT WAS EVER DREAMT UP ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR IS IN THIS MOVIE. WILLIAM KATT, PLAYING THE PART OF AN OFFICER WHO'D BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN VIETNAM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS,IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS FOR ANYONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT THROUGH THIS STINKER."
4,Energetic Japanese Hardcore,"Fast, bass-heavy, lots of synth loops. This is their 7th album, 2nd since Park (released in US in 96). Better than any hardcore bands released in the US so far. Industrial leanings. Big following, their shows in Japan sell out in hours."
2,ongoing disappointment,Put yourself in my place will always be her best album and the one time height of her career. It's like she used most of her most rocking songs (and best ideas) on her first album and since that time couldn't do near as well. How she's made so many lame albums since is because most country folk like constant remakes of past country songs and a lot of slow sappy ballads. Juice Newton did a lot better back in the 80's because she always stuck to country rock and was terrific from album to album and never changed to attract a different audience such as what Pam Tillis has been doing after her first album. On Sweetheart's Dance I only liked four songs because they weren't remakes or slow songs. How anyone could consider this album an equal to Put Yourself In My Place has got to be joking.
2,Was this a Stephanie Plum novel at all?,"Just finished reading Hard Eight in four hours straight, and after eagerly waiting for its release for a year I'm extremely disappointed. Its a good enough book, well written, etc but its not the happy-go-lucky romantic comedy that I've come to expect from Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum. ...For those who think the Stephanie Plum series is unrealistic fluff, you'll like this book. Die-hard fans like me are going to read it anyway, hope you're not as disappointed as I was."
3,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was extremely disappointed in this book, but I have been a bit disappointed in the last 2 or 3 of the Stephanie Plum books.Maybe it's because after this many books, everything I thought was funny has now become routine; I thought Grandma Mazur had a very tiny role, and what there was seemed inane. I usually anticipate the yearly release, but now will have to rethink future purchases. One disappointment was the hasty ending. Multiple pages of buildup and a quick, abrupt end that was quite a disappointment in itself."
3,Good but one small problem,"I liked this book. It was interesting, funny, and had great characters but the theme of Stephanie Plum making bad decisions got old really quickly."
1,are you KIDDING??,"I don't know who is writing these reviews, but you've got to be kidding me. This was one of the most trite books I've ever read. It was like every cop/action movie, but worse. The humor is NOT funny (unless you find Full House hilarious, in which case, buy the entire Janet Evanovich series), and sex scenes are tossed about shamelessly in places where it is entirely inappropriate... for instance, after Stephanie is abducted, beaten, and almost killed. she's gone for SEVERAL HOURS, and as soon as she gets back, she gets it on. WHO DOES THAT??? ""yeah honey, i was just diagnosed with cancer... whaddya say we head upstairs?"" i recommend you stay far away from this book, unless you're okay with an obvious storyline, a plot lacks any sense of reality, and humor that yearns for comparison to Yakov Smirnoff."
1,Book review,"I ordered this book on December 13, 2010 and have yet to receive it as of January 14, 2011. I definitely will not order anything from this company again!"
3,Only made me laugh til I cried twice.,"I enjoyed reading Hard Eight but have to say it's not the best in the series. All the usual happens, Stephanie blows up a few cars, people are shot and there's a lot of heavy breathing over Morelli but I just didn't enjoy it as much. Plus after waiting FOREVER to find out what happened between Stephanie and Ranger, it's only barely mentioned when you're well into the book.A new character is introduced that takes Grandma Mazur's place as comic relief. Let me just say the scene with Klougn(?) and the dryer makes me glad I bought this book.This is a good story in the continuing series but I wouldn't recommend it to any newbies. Start at the beginning with One for The Money. If you've enjoyed Stephanie's other adventures, you'll enjoy this one and you know you have to buy it to find out what happened in the bedroom in Seven Up:)"
4,Advice to Readers,"I guess in all honesty the last thing this world needs is another review of this book. However, I think there are two kinds of people who are contemplating reading it - those who have read all the previous books, and those who haven't read any. Here's my advice to these groups.If you have read all of the previous Stephanie Plum books, your going to love this one just as much because it's a whole lot more of the same fun and farce. If you haven't read any, then you should really go back to One For The Money, because if you start with this you're missing a lot of valuable information and very enjoyable reading."
5,BIG Evanovich fan-have read them all,"I have read all her books MANY times, her older ones the most.While, they are all good, some are better than others. Janet,is always ENTERTAINING, never boring! Hard Eight is hands downher BEST! Everytime she manages to out do her last book, when,I think it can't be possible, she ups the antey. I've met herin person, also, she is very personable. Very much StephaniePlum. If you've never read her before I do suggest you startwith One For The Money, to truely appreciate the series. Shealways makes me laugh, and I enjoy her as much as a comedian. Ifyou like mystery, humor, romance and fun-you've got it.Hope you'll read and enjoy-she IS THE BEST!"
4,Back on Track,"I was a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series up through book 5, then very disappointed in numbers 6 and 7. I had decided to stop reading the series til a friend convinced me to read Hard Eight and I'm glad I did. While not quite as good as the earlier books, this one was a vast improvement over the last two, with better pacing and character development. The dialogue was wittier and relied less on slapstick, although still very funny. That said, I agree with others that I'd like to see Stephanie developing a few more skills at her job--after this length of time you'd think she'd be getting a LITTLE bit better at it! She could still be funny without being so incompetent. And I found the long-awaited love scene with Ranger perfunctory at best. But all in all, the book was a fun read and kept me interested to the very end."
3,Disappointing,I have read and enjoyed all of Janet Evanovich's novels butas she proceeds through the series they seem to be gettingmuch thinner. By this I mean little plot and very littleaction development. Sometimes its like reading a person'sday planner. I read them and will continue to do so as Ireally like her characters and there are still many laughs.
3,What did she do to Ranger?,"Boy, was I disappointed in this book! It has a great plot and lots of action, as do all of the books in this series, so I have to give JE stars for that, but none for characterization. I know, they are JE's characters and she can write them however she wants, but I think she wrote Ranger too differently here from the other books. In the other books he comes off as really caring for Stephanie in his own mysterious way, but in Hard Eight JE has him acting like a jerk to her. I'm wondering if JE has been overwhelmed by the amount of support Ranger has gotten from many fans, so now she's trying to get out of having to keep him in the forefront by trying to make us dislike him. Sorry, JE, but I'm not buying Ranger as merely an ""opportunist"", and I'm also not buying any future books in this series until you bring back the Ranger you originally created - the one who has real feelings for Stephanie."
2,Hard is right...hard to finish.,"Okay, so maybe it's not fair for me to judge this book, seeing as how I'm only on page 60-something -- but I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan, and already ""Hard Eight"" is a major disappointment. I can hardly believe this latest adventure is written by the same Janet Evanovich whose previous books were so hilarious, irreverent, raunchy, and just plain laugh-out-loud wonderful. This honestly reads like some college student in a mystery writing class who's decided, ""Oh, I can do that"" -- and can't. The humor (such as it is) is terribly labored (the running gags have officially run out of steam) and the prose is endlessly repetitive, clunky and -- what's most shocking for an Evanovich book -- boooring. If I finish ""Hard Eight"" it will be in the spirit in which Ms. Evanovich seems to have written it: as a not particularly pleasant chore because she had nothing better to do -- or a publisher's deadline. Only for the most undiscriminating reader."
5,"This was the best, I'm totally addicted.","The book kept me on the edge of my seat, I love Stephanie Plum, Ranger and especially Morelli. I can't wait to read #9, Alot of people said they were disappointed, on the contrary, the book was great."
4,like it,You feel as if you really know the characters and it is never dull. I'd like it better without so much cursing.
4,Hard Eith,Stephanie Plum is hiliarious I cant get enough of her adventures. Her and Lula never disappoint. This is series is the funniest I have ever read.
3,Listener Beware,"Stephanie Plum everyone's favorite semi-heroine, does it again, a great story. Just do your self a favor and save your money and buy the paperback book, not the audio tape. It never fails, they get a good reader, get you hooked on the stories, and for some reason they throw the baby out with the bathwater, they change the narrators. This one is the pits. I enjoy the audio books as I travel. The reader makes an enormous impact on the feel of the story. This lady ruins the story. I had to force myself to listen to the whole thing, in spite of her terrible narration. Please save your money. ""Listener Beware"""
5,Another Great - Hard Eight,"This book continued in the best tradition of Stephanie Plum antics, getting not only a new person involved in her adventures, but letting Mom and Sis in on this one too. A good book, with a good ending that leaves you wanting more of the same. I've never been disappointed in an Evanovich novel. . ."
3,Could be better,"The Hard Eight is a very good and detailed story, but i did not enjoy the book. It is very funny starting from the first paragraph to the end of the book. Of course it does not matter how good the story is if does not read well. i thought the book was poorly written and showed no emotion. Plus, it did not follow, but jumped from one thing to the next. i had to force myself to pick up the book and actually try to read it."
5,"Plum fun, more chaotic than usual","I'm a big fan of this wacky mystery series featuring Jersey bounty hunter babe Stephanie Plum and her bizarre family and super sexy love interests. Evanovich's humor and moment by moment inventiveness don't fail in this eighth book in the series, which I highly recommend for a fun summer read. Stacking it up to the rest, it's not my favorite, as there are some odd loose ends here - a rival bounty hunter babe in a leather catsuit, for example, who is never explored or paid off. However it's worth the read just to see Stephanie and the mysterious Ranger finally get it on. It's not five stars for literary merit, or even the best of her series,but even Evanovich at her less-than-best is way, way better than most. Guaranteed fun!"
2,Just started,"This is the first of Janet Evanovich's novels I've read and I can say so far the style and content is superior to Crusie's in ""Fast Women."" I would imagine ""Hard Eight"" would appeal to readers from Germantown and around that area. I, personally, can't relate, and the charaters so far seem a tad ""tacky."" But Evanovich has an easy style and I'll read on and see how it goes..."
4,Gotta love Plum,"Still funny and still sizzling. Stephanie is back as her usual bungling, but incredibly lucky, self. I have loved books 1-7 and this was a great next installment. The books in the series are fast paced and hilarious. One complaint--I want more relationship development. What are Stephanie's true feelings for Morelli and Ranger. Janet, don't leave us hanging like this. The relationships are shallowly described. Give us more detail and emotion."
5,Laugh out loud funny...,"Stephanie Plum has all kinds of problems. She's looking for a mom who's kidnapped her own daughter. She's being chased by an evil rabbit. Cars are blowing up. A Pillsbury Doughboy of a lawyer wants to be her new sidekick. Her sister's depressed. But the biggest problem of all is her man problems. Morelli is still claiming they're on a break, and Ranger is angling his way into her bed. Things are complicated to say the least. But somehow Stephanie will come through.Janet Evanovich doesn't disappoint in this hilarious new Stephanie Plum novel!"
4,Another winner,As usual Ms. Evanovich takes us for a wild crazy ride with Stephanie and her loveable cohorts. I've already preordered her next book.
5,Great seires.,Strap on your helmet and get ready for the ride of your life! Hard Eight. The world of Stephanie Plum has never been wilder.
2,Evanovich following Robert Parker's footsteps,I was disappointed to see that Evanovich is following Parker's footsteps. Relying on dialogue instead of description to move the story along. Repeating the same senarios over again is just plain lazy. You would think that in number eight in a series her characters would have developed more and her action sequences would show more imagination. By now Stephanie Plum as a character should be more interesting and experienced. Unfortunatly she's just irritating and immature. A good series would keep the reader wondering where the main character will go next. In Evanovich's case her character goes nowhere and learns nothing.
1,Flat. . .Flat. . .Flat,"I have read every Plum novel and this one was a stretch. It seemed to recycle every ""old"" joke from the first 7 novels. Janet what happened? It seems that your ending was convenient because you did not know how to end the book. Personally I kept wondering where this was really going. Hope # 9 will be better"
2,Not so great,"Yeah, what Marc Ruby(tm) ""The Noh Hare(tm)"" said. Exactly how I feel about the writing of this book."
2,The same old thing,"How long is it going to take for Plum to learn? is she developmentally slow? She still can't shoot, put hand cuffs on keep a car. She is an insult to women. I purchased some of her books when Borders was going out of business, Im going to skim those (you really don' thave to read them) and then I'm through. I don't plan to pick up another one of these books until I read a review saying that the character has grown."
3,"A fun murder mystery,",Janet has again kept the dark side fun and thrilling. Ms. Plum is the crime solver in all of us.
4,Good listen for working out,"Stephanie Plum novels are terrific to listen to while working out. A walk or a run goes by more quickly while listening to these light and funny mysteries. Sure, the characters sometimes don't seem to learn how to avoid their many mishaps, but their mishaps are entertaining!"
1,Enough Already!,"It's time to wrap this thing up! This one's a labor to get through. The characters are dull and very predictable. A few more cars are destroyed... That said, number nine isn't needed. Don't buy it, borrow someone else's--better yet, TAKE my copy!"
5,Classic Stephanie,"This latest entry in the Stephanie Plum series has all the trademark Evanovich touches: great car scenes, recalcitrant fugitives, menacing bad guys, stun gun accidents, Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Grandma, and, of course, at least one new quirky character, in this case a lawyer named Kloughn. The end of the book is somewhat flat and abrupt, but despite that the book is laugh-out-loud funny and a thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,Better than I'd hoped.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hard Eight, the latest Stephanie Plum enstallment. I thought it was a much better book than the last two. I especially appreciated that it did not end in a cliffhanger, which I have not at all enjoyed in the previous couple of books, and which I consider to be a cheap trick. The action was great, the humor fantastic, and the relationships between Steph and Ranger and Joe were developed to a greater degree than in previous books. I couldn't quite give it 5 stars, due to one particular little scene, but if you have enjoyed the previous books in this series, this is well worth reading."
5,Do We Have to Wait Another Year for Nine??!!,"As we've come to expect from Ms. Evanovich, Hard Eight is a bumpy, crazy ride in the amusement park that is Stephanie Plum's life. Although Ms. Plum is a bounty hunter, it is obvious that she would find murder and mayhem, (not to mention sexy, complicated men), if she were a garbage collector. The dialogue in this book is witty and sharp, and the plot twists are deliciously predictable. Let's face it: we know the car is going to blow up, it's just a matter of when and how. Anyone who is a fan of Ranger will have to take a cold shower when she's done with the book. Morelli doesn't do too badly, either. Thank goodness we can count on Evanovich to make Stephanie's men say things that most of us will go to our graves without hearing from actual men. All in all, a fun evening of reading."
2,A Bit of a Dissapointment,"I recently became addicted to the Stephanie Plum series, but was pretty dissapointed with this one. Everything happened a little too fast, every kook can be compared to a kook from one of her other books. Not awful, but not nearly as good as #5 or #7."
2,"Oh Janet, I guess Eight was Hard. . .","After devouring the first seven in the series, I tore open the eighth and sat down for what I just knew would be a laugh out loud but exciting read. I was so disappointed in this one. I only laughed out loud once, the ending was predictable and the bad guy was ""been there, done that."" So, Janet fans - - you'll like it because we all like Stephanie; but, when you're done you'll feel just a bit guilty that you want your money back."
4,Hard Eight,"Not as good as the first seven novels. It all wrapped up in the last 2 pages, making you feel rather let down. The characters didn't seem as ""real"" in this book."
4,Hard Eight,"I never get tired of her books, and now my 21 year old granddaughter is hooked on them too.Her books are funny, suspense, and quirky fast read."
5,Great and Funny Book,"Stephanie Plum, the character in these books, is a riot. She gets into the type of trouble we wish we could but not dare. Love the two hunks in her life and her family are real characters especially her Grandma and Mother. The only problem is the reader, she's ok but I wish the original reader from book one and two had continued to read all the books. This reader is a little dull and has no range for changing characters. But if you can get past her voice to the story you'll love it."
3,IT IS TIME TO MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL!!!,"As with many fans of Ms. Evanovich, I could not wait for the next book to be released. I raced to the bookstore to buy it. I did not take a break for food or water or bio break as I wanted to read the book straight through. The humour and Laugh Out Loud lines or retorts are ever present and sprinkled in the story right when you need them. I was a bit disappointed that with book ""eight"" Stephanie has not gone beyond the predictable disasters and chases. What makes Ms. Evanovich work's so much fun and appealing is the obsurdity of the event, the unusual, the unpredictable, regardless of the degree or severity of it. I think it is time for Stephanie to make a commitment and let the adventures move to the next level. I still can't wait for the next book. Hope we don't have to wait until next summer."
3,"Been there, read that","I have to say, this series is getting stale. Unless Janet Evanovich can invent some new twists to throw in her next books, we might as well just reread the first four books over and over. Nothing new has happened since then, except in each book I wait the entire time for Stephanie to get together with one or the other of her two hot hunks, and keep getting mad when she doesn't manage.I am wondering if Janet doesn't have a formula on her wall somewhere telling her exactly how to write her books: A car must blow up on page ninety, a bail jumper must foil Stephanie on page one twenty, and so on.On the plus side, Stephanie Plum is fun, unflappable, good hearted, and every once in a while she even has a serious moment, when she actually can connect with the reader on a deaper level and make you think about things."
2,Not very good,"This was the worst book Janet Evanovich has written. The plot was non-existant and the characters were warmed over versions from her earlier books. The book felt as if it had been written hastily just to get it on the shelf for the summer beach crowd. You really can do better than this, Janet."
1,this is a romance?,"this book [is bad]. it is supposed to be a romantic supense novel. where is the romance in having sex with someone other than the love interest? i was totally disappointed in stephanie's behavior with ranger. i always thought ms. evanovich was an excellent romance writer, but she has totally missed the mark in this book. the mystery portion was okay. the laughs were okay. as a book about a woman who sleeps around it is okay. as a romantic supense novel 2 thumbs down."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah","I breaks my heart, Stephanie is getting boring!! The series is now too redundant to bear. The last two books have been substandard. It is time to let Stephanie move on."
4,"Snakes, geese and exploding cars........","In Hard Eight, Stephanie Plum returns as a fugitive apprehension agent, aka a bounty hunter. This time she is dragged into a child custody bond case by her parents' neighbor. A child and her mother are missing and if they don't return the neighbor (grandmother of the missing child) will lose her home! Things go crazy from the start, whacky Jersey mobsters, bags of snakes, attacking fowl, exploding cars and a love life that brings with it it's own questions! Introduce an eager puppy of a lawyer and Stephanie's ""perfect"" sister still looking for herself and Janet Evanovich has written another winning novel. The humor, the disasters and the unique investigating technique of Stephanie Plum all add up to ""HARD EIGHT""."
5,Loved it,I have been reading the Stephanie Plum series for years and the series is still going strong. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
2,"Done, Finished, Bored, Eight is Enough","Let me start by saying that I started to read all of JE books in order. The first 3 or 4 books were so entertaining that I continued to read on. Then all of a sudden her books started to really get on my nerves. The same things over and over and over. Not to mention the stupid dog and his antics. I really tried to go on but I realized that from eight to nineteen things will never change. Things happen to her and her friends and family that are just so unbelievable they make you scratch your head and wonder do people really believe this crap? Sorry Janet, but if you want to keep us readers interested you have to come up with somethings new and exciting. Just my own opinion of course."
3,Hard eight,Quick reads for traveling. But a bit simple. Lula needs to b a bit deeper not so foolish. How many times can the same thing happen to a person b4 it gets REALLY old?
4,"funny, fast read","Janet Evanovich entertain her reader once again with bounty hunter Stephanie Plum's silly predicaments. As she continues to struggle with her romantic feelings for two men, she searches for a mother and daughter who have disappeared."
1,Hard Eight is Hard to Take,"After such a wonderful beginning this series has gone steadily down hill. The characters are no longer admirable or interesting. The...sassy heroine is now a total ditz, the hot hero a wimpy whiner, and the numero uno man of mystery a murdering... predator. The fun is gone and so am I. I won't bother spending another penny on this series."
2,don't bother,"I have to agree with the Fort Worth reader. The story has some funny moments, but this is just another romance novel, complete with insipid heroine in need of being rescued, then boinked (or boinked then rescued ... whatever). She is supposed to be college educated. Why is Steph suddenly so stupid? C'mon, leaving her keys in the car while attempting to pick up a FTA, and later going out for pizza when she knows she is being stalked by a maniac is reaching. I really don't care how hot Ranger is. Why should she worry about death cooties on her sofa, then sleep unprotected with a guy who has been with the bar maid at the sleazy pizza joint? Eeeewwww.Stephanie needs to get a brain transplant. If I want to read this kind of garbage, l'll pick up a Harlequin."
2,The first half stunk but the second half was OK.,I've read two of these Stephanie Plum books and I personally find her constant slap stick bungling irritating. That's why I stopped reading them. When I picked Hard Eight up at the library I thought it was that other female PI from Chicago. Oops.
5,Another hit by Janet !,"I've been waiting for this book since I finished book #7 ... and I wasn't dissapointed. Janet has once again written a wonderful, funny, can't put the book down novel. I loved it! I highly recommend this book ... a must have if you're a Janet fan."
1,What is stupid and obvious?,This 4th-grade reading material is boring and beyond stupid.Avoid this drivel at ALL costs.
3,lacking,"I have been a huge Evanovich fan from the very first Plum novel. I was very disappointed in ""Hard Eight."" For seven whole books she stringed us along wondering what Ranger would be like, only to let us down with the extremely short result. I found all her adventures in this novel were too neatly wrapped up. Her criminals were too easily caught too quickly. I don't want to give away details, so it's hard to explain myself as fully as I would like to, but I hope the next Plum mystery has more meat to it than this one did."
5,Janet Evanovich does it again,Book 8 continues on the lines of the first 7 in the series. The book is funny and filled with suspense. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good laugh and a great book.
2,Hard-ly worth it,"Big disappointment. Stephanie's cars blow up, she loses handcuffs, she still hates shooting her gun, although she's a hell of a marksman in her apartment building. The whole Abruzzi plot is contrived and fizzles in the end. As does the ""GREAT RANGER SEX SCENE"" which is about as long as this review. You'd think a romance writer could have done a better sex scene, especially after building it up for seven books. Let's just say the seeming extent of Ranger's sexual prowess could be called ""Hard Ate."" Big deal. Marv Albert does that and he's no mysterious, rock-hard bounty hunter.Janet is still good at getting laughs, although much less frequently than before. She needs to put more work into character development and plot. It's time to move on from Stephanie being a stupid, but lovable, idiot.After this, I'm waiting for Nine in paperback."
3,So much anticipation and then...,"This is the first Evanovich book that didn't have me laughing from beginning to end. Very disappointed when compared to her previous 7 books. It was still an enjoyable read, just not the usual fun."
3,not so hard 8,"having just discovered this series about a week ago I devoured books 1-7 in time for hard eight to come out the other day. I read it in about 3 hours and had mixed feelings when i finished.I of course was glad to be back in the lives of steph, joe, ranger and grandma mazur, but was left with an empty feeling as if the book never got down and dirty with any of them this time.I felt as if i was involved in a game of duck duck goose with the characters just tapping each one on the head to know they were there but never claiming anyone of them to be ""it"". The ending left us guessing that the next installment will be called""Nine months: whos the papa"". For all Plum fans read on you will still enjoy as i did....I just felt a bit empty afterwards..."
3,Hard Eight - on audio,"I have listened to the majority of the Stephanie Plum series on audio, narrated by talented voice actress C.J. Critt. Ms. Critt does a fantastic job with the voice characterizations, but even she could not make this a truly good story. I found this book a little ""darker"" and less humorous than the previous seven in the series. Stephanie began to get on my nerves in places. I enjoyed getting to know Ranger better and he has an even bigger share of this book than Joe Morelli. This is not a bad book and I will keep reading the series; however, this story is not as clever as some of the other Evanovich books."
4,Hilarious fun,"I have greatly enjoyed reading all of the Stephanie Plum mysteries. The Jersey-girl-turned-bounty-hunter is a terrific character, and so are the whole cast of folks who pop in and out of her chaotic life. You'll laugh a LOT, guaranteed. I just wish the mystery in this book was better thought out. The plot and its unlikely resolution seem almost like afterthoughts. Maybe you (like me) can live with that, in exchange for the fun of this highly character-driven series."
2,I agree w/ Merylnne from Ireland,"I was there when the librarian put the brand new, One For the Money out on the shelf in hardcover, snapped it up, devoured it and was hooked. But here, I was disappointed too. I wondered as I read it whether it is the last book in the series. The introduction of the stupid lawyer and his idiotic incompetence and the other woman bounty hunter show us how far Stephanie has come and how far she still is from having professional expertise. But the end does not really set up the next book, instead, it's ""Stick a fork in me, I'm done."" I hope I'm wrong! I must say though, that Ranger is hot (and gallant at the end), and I have always loved Morelli."
2,Who wrote this book?,"Once again the book after a big cliffhanger has left me disappointed. Not that it wasn't a good story, it was. It had a lot of classic Stephanie moments. I just don't understand how two of the major characters could be so different in this book from the previous seven. Neither Ranger, nor Morelli seemed like themselves. And speaking of Ranger, I waited seven books for a resolution that came in 2 paragraphs and a ""I've got to go?"" Nope, sorry, this book was a big disappointment to me. I'm not so sure I will even bother with book 9."
2,A little lame,"I am sorry to say it, but Hard Eight was kind of lame. Janet can do better - she's done better in the past. Maybe she's getting tired of it, or maybe the grind of having to churn out a book a year is getting to her. There was nothing new here. The old tried and true antics are now just old. Stephanie's car blowing up just isn't funny anymore. And there was no real plot. Stephanie wasn't really after anybody and therefore wasn't really doing anything. And the rabbit was not anywhere near as hilarious as Janet seemed to think it was! Spoiler warning: The scene where Ranger and Stephanie finally ""do it"" was anti-climatic. There was no emotion, no connection between the characters. Very superficial. Very disappointing.I normally hate having to wait a year for the next installment of Stephanie's life, but this time I will be waiting two years - for the paperback intead of the hardcover."
4,Another Great Ride!,"Strap yourself in for another wild ride with Stephanie Plum, laughing and engaged through all the twists and turns. Read it by the pool after a new novel that our book club picked up, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Janet Evanovich makes me laugh, Kirk Martin makes me cry. Perfect complements. Can't wait for NINE!!"
1,Missing Eight,"Who wrote this book? Surely not the author who gave each character a heart and soul in the previous 7 books. This is little more than an outline with characters tossed in, making statements obviously lifted from previous books. Don't forget we know these people. The biggest let-down was the encounter between Stephanie and Ranger. It was shallow and not believable. Please don't judge the series by this book. But I must say that I will wait for reviews before buying the next Evanovich offering."
2,Creepy - this should be a Stephanie Plum novel?,"I have to admit I am a great fan of the series but now Janet Evanovich did it: I'm quitting! I can't believe she wrote this book! The last 50 pages were awful. If she thought she had to change something to keep her fans still interested in the series she could have wrote something that was funny but ""Hard Eight"" definitely was NOT funny. It's a hard-boiled crime novel and nothing I wanted to read as Stephanie Plum series fan. All I can say is I am totally disappointed, I could have saved my money."
5,Great author,"Janet Evanovich books were recommended to me by a friend. I started with One for the Money and have been reading the series. I just finished Hard Eight and can't wait to start the next one. If you have ever lived in or around New Jersey or have had relatives that have, you can relate to some of the people and events in the book. I laugh out loud at some of Stephanie's encounter."
2,writing by numbers,I have eagerly awaited each new book in the series but this one has almost put me off buying any more. It feels as though it was written by someone else copying the style of the last ones. What worked in the previous books - lets throw in some of that. The car thing is getting old . The ranger scene - less said the better after such a great build up.I bought the previous books as soon as they were released in hardback. The next one can wait till paperback and even then i'll read a bit in the bookshop first before purchasing.What a letdown.
2,disappointing,"I started the series with Seven Up, loved it, then read the rest. Hard Eight was disappointing. It seems rushed, unfinished. It lacks the usual joi de vivre of the previous books. The Ranger affair was badly handled. None of the characters seemed like themselves and the situations often seemed forced. I think a bit more editing and it could have been so good (if the Ranger thing was fixed too!) I hope Nine is a return to form."
3,I've read better Plum mysteries.,"I was disappointed with this story, the first 6 books were amazing and I think it may be time for Steph to retire. Her long awaited encounter with Ranger is all of one paragraph and the plot is weak. I think I'll go back and read the early ones, I miss Stephanie and the gang at their best."
2,Such a disappointment,"I fell in love with the Stephanie Plum series from the start, but feel it peaked at about #3. I still rush out to buy a new entry on the day it's published, but... I think I'll stop now. After books worth of anticipation, Stephanie's encounter with Ranger is anticlimactic; her relationship with Joe has almost reached an adult-like maturity; and the constant rehashing of past events (books) is a bore. Something has gone very wrong with this terrific character and I sure hope Ms.Evanovich can resusitate her."
1,Hard Eight - Unabridged Audio,"REVIEW IS FOR AUDIO ONLY!!! I have all of the Stephanie Plum series in hardback and audio. I can't wait for the next book to be released. HOWEVER, I didn't even finish listening to Hard Eight. The narrator read Stephanie Plum like she was a private school graduate. She was too precise and definitely didn't come from the 'burg. I was extremely disappointed in this audio. If Lorelei King continues to narrate Stephanie Plum, I will no longer purchase these on audio."
2,Downward Turn,"I realize that the Stephanie Plum series is primarily written for women and I can appreciate that. Even though I am a guy I had really enjoyed the books until this one. First of all, I grew very tired of all the misadventures. I know that is the charm of her character but I think she averaged 3 strange encounters a day. It just wasn't very realistic. Also, the ending was terrible. If Ranger was going to take care of her business anyway, why did he let her waste all that time? Lastly, is there going to be a point when Stephanie actually becomes semi-independent and competent. I am starting to lose the love for Ms. Plum."
3,Not the right match of voice to book (audio version),"The book itself is, as ever, great--who doesn't enjoy Evanovich's Stephanie Plum? But the reader, while excellent at enunciating, just *isn't* the right match. She makes Stephanie sound overeducated, prim, and in her 40's. I really hope the audio publisher goes back to using ""Joisey"" voices like Lori Petty or Debi Mazur and continues to use this reader for books that need more ""class"" and less ""streetwise."""
4,The Dark Side,"While this book still serves up plenty of drools and laughs, Evanovich has upped the ante in this one with some hard edges and a bit more menace. Evanovich also manages to turn up the heat as well with even more Ranger. Evanovich's writing is fluid and smooth with a great balance between the usual craziness that is Stephanie's life and the more sinister characters and situations she's put in."
4,Rescue Stephanie,"Too close to real life, Stephanie is becoming mundane with age. It's hard to imagine why not just one but two hunks repeatedly come to her rescue when she shows no resourcefulness, self esteem or self control over her burgeoning appetite. While this book was entertaining, Stephanie was not. This series is read for escapism, so crank up the heat and give Stephanie back her spunk and soul."
4,Once Again,"i loved this book and so should u. it was entertaining, hillarious, and a best buy from amazon.com. pick it up, and discover the humour the author has to offer. also, i recommend the other 7 books that the author has published. happy reading!!!"
3,WOW,"Number 6 and seven held such promise for Steph and Ranger's first time togther, but when we finally did get to it it was HALF- a paragraph.I mean serously, with all the hinting and the danger that Ranger present you would think he would be a...""I'm taking you as my woman pose"", but instead we got""i'll roll over and let you run back to the cop"". So not happy with this right now. I think if she wasn't going to flesh the characters out or even make the scene between Steph and Ranger worth it, she should have left it to our imaginations.Apart from that the story was o.k. the characters weren't as fleshed out as they used to be, but i still had some laughs, not as much but enough to say i'll keep the book."
3,Not up to usual standards,"Even though I count down the days until mid June every year for the next Stephanie Plum adventure, I think maybe we should give Janet Evanovich a bit of a break. She might need a little more time to write the ninth adventure. Although this book is the next logical step in the series, Ranger came off scarier than the bad guy, Abruzzi. Beginning and end of the book were still gigle aloud, but the middle read slowly--and I stay up all night to read the new book the day it comes out. Hang in there, Janet, and give us a release date in 2 years for Nine."
1,Lost it!,"I have read 1 thru 7. Thats enough! Its not funny anymore, the plot is weak and this adult woman can't seem to make up her mind whether she is in love or not and with whom. Grandma isn't funny anymore either. Was that a Joe Pesci clone for the lawyer, as in Lethal Weapon? JE you can do better, just crank em out now that people buy them."
2,My first Stephanie Plum -- Maybe that's the mistake,"This was my first Stephanie Plum, or Janet Evanovich, for that matter. Got it in the RV park library. I was just looking for something fun. Well, it wasn't much. Maybe I'm too old or maybe I like GOOD literature too much to be taken in. Great writing it isn't! I kept thinking perhaps ""Janet Evanovich"" was a pen name for some adolescent boy in my former middle school English class. The ending took the cake. It was about as good as ""it was all a dream."" I did read to the end though -- therefore the 2 stars."
2,Least favorite of the series so far,"Have absolutely loved the series up till this one. It's not awful, but it lacks the humor that I've come to expect. Also C.J. Critt, who narrated the early CDs, has been replaced. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan but ....."
2,Not as expected,"The item did arrive in a timely manner, but it was not as described. The product was pretty beat up and used a lot more then slightly."
3,Eight is not enough!,"It's hard not to like this series. Altho the storyline was a bit different,I liked it. Ranger and Joe were merely passing thru. I did not like that. I dont want this tension to ever end but it seems they ran fleetingly thru the book and Steph's life. Lula is always a hoot. Grandma Mazur is wonderful but I could do without Steph's sister and her kids. Extraneous. Waiting for the next."
2,Not as strong as her earlier works,"As much as I love reading about the mis-adventures of Stephanie Plum, I just didn't find this most recent adventure to be as entertaining as others in the past."
2,Stephanie Plum where are you?,"Whow not a Wow book! I was looking forward to another fun and fantastic read from Janet Evonovich and was very disapointed in the results. The same elements were here as with the other 7 books in the series, but the writing wasn't on par as before. The story was told, but it never got off the ground and played itself out. It read like it was a forced and fast write instead of the witty banter, insights and character developement we've come to expect. I'm sure I'll still buy the 9th in the series, but without holding my breathe."
3,hard eight,"the editorial reviewer who said this book wasn't as good as her others. It wasn't, but even that still merits four stars. It still made me laugh out loud, feel miserable and also cringe horribly (particularly towards the end)."
3,From I Love Lucy to the Perils of Paulien,"I very much enjoy the series and have re-read ever book at least twice. Its smart, funny and a slice of American culture most of us never get to see (Newark). Unfortunatly, in attempting to grow and evolve the main character ""Stephanie"", Ms. Evanovich seems to have droped what made the character so apealing. We went from a great character who could get herself in an out of trouble faster then you can wink into a more helpless character that has everyone else (including her mother) constantly having to save her. All in all the book was a disappointment. The last couple of books in the series I pre-ordered just to make sure I could read it as soon as it came out. Next time I think I'll just wait until it's available at the local library."
1,No go!,"A big disappointment. I own all Stephany Plum books. I loved the first three. It was downhill since. I am returning this one to the store. It simply is not worth the money. It feels like the author ran out of ideas and in a rush to complete yet one more book. Ms. Evanovich, your readers deserve better."
2,How Sad. It's Boring,"I remember when I first discovered the series and would curl and laugh one weekend morning. Four to Score being the hieght of the series. This one, Eight, felt phoned in, like it was made up of rejected bits from other books. Boring actually. The scene with Ranger a crime. I remember I always used to grin through their encounters now I could easily take a nap."
5,amazing,"great collection of covers from the yardbirds shapes of things to jimi hednrix angel. i have the domestic copy but i got the import for the four songs that are only on thr import, jeffs version of freedom by hendrix is worth the price of this cd"
4,Cover to Cover,Great album full of the Jeff Healey tone. Love the use of the wah pedal throughout. Must add to music library.
3,"Come on Jeff, Covers?","Jeff Healey is a phenomenally talented and gifted guitarist who deserves attention beyond the borders of his Canadian homeland. With that understanding, it is somewhat puzzling to me that he would go into the studio to record 16 covers, 4 of which, ""Freedom"" (Jimi Hendrix), ""I Got A Line"" (Randy California), ""Run Through The Jungle"" (J.C. Fogerty) and ""Badge"" (Eric Clapton) appear only on the version released overseas. Moreover, how does ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" make it on a blues/rock CD?Outside of Jeff's spectacular playing, there is nothing new hear whatsoever. I deduct 2 stars for the lack of original material and recommend the 1992 release 'Feel This"" as an alternative."
2,Water Resources Engineering,"This book is loaded with good information, but we found errors in key hydraulic formulas, which quickly led me not to trust anything out of the book. The sad part is, this was a required text for an engineering class. Maybe the new edition has remedied the problems, but I wouldn't recommend the edition I bought."
1,Did not fit,Product did not fit despite OEM claim. I recommend that you confirm parts with your dealer prior to making an online purchase.
3,Deceptively mormonistic,"Overall the book is good however the chapter about debt has some veiled reference to the LDS or mormon church. Since it is cleverly concealed I am very concerned about what other heretical information is concealed within its covers. It is sold as a ""Christian"" book and then praises the false religion of mormonism and attempts to associate it with christianity. It is the usual pattern of the deceiver to take some truth and add a little deception to legitimize a heresy. Even the website of the Life Study fellowship is very deceptive. It reveals no associations and does not offer a doctrinal or belief statement. The hook or goal is to get you to subscribe to a magazine that is also deceptively difficult to research. If it looks like a cult and acts like a cult then it likely is a cult. Please be alert to the possible deception."
3,WAAAAAAAAY overpriced,"this toy is very cool, but I just bought it as well as the t-rex with the saddle at walmart for 10 bucks each."
4,GREAT,"Very fast shipping. Toy came packaged very well, perfect condition. This is going to be a christmas presant for my son who LOVES dinosaurs. We had seen several while out shopping but packaging was torn badly on the one and the other one was dirty. Was very happy to find it online and for a cheaper price then either of the stores where we had seen them. I would buy from seller again."
5,Shakespeare never looked so cool!,I am not an especially big fan of Shakespeare based movies but this movie is the exception. It was an absolutely briliant idea to adapt the play to a ficticious 1930s era nazi like England. It fit so well. McKellan's performance was excellent. The last time I enjoyed wathing an evil character so much was Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Shakespeare's concentrated dialog is a little hard to follow but in this movie it doesn't matter. The performances and brilliant adaptation are so cool you get sucked in even if you miss a line here or there.
2,Not everyone thought it was genius...,"Two words: Shakespeare liteDon't get me wrong, I love my Shakespeare, and the idea of adapting a Shakespearean play to more concurrent events is an excellent concept, but I found the movie lacking in substance.McKellan does an excellent job. I found, however, that Bening and Downey Jr. seemed terribly ""fish out of water"".The DVD, as well, is pretty lacklustre, with hardly an extra in sight."
5,"Saw the movie, will buy the video","I saw the movie in Washington, DC at a Dupont Circle theater. I was so bowled over that I went back four times. I never see a movie more than twice. I talked about the movie for weeks afterward!Setting the ancient tale in 1930 fascist England just goes to prove the timless nature of Shakespeare and how it speaks today across the ages.This was the first Ian McKellen movie I have ever seen and he was incredible. I saw him again in the adaptation of the Stephen King short story, ""Apt Pupil."" The man can really bring life to a character."
2,Destruction of a Masterpiece: A comment on Richard III,"Many consider Shakespeare the greatest writer of all times and when his beautiful work is manipulated and degraded, as in this version of Richard III, it is a great loss. Movies are supposed to use actions and pictures to support the words, but here the words, not the pictures, convey the emotion and meaning in the story. In Richard Loncraine's film, it seemed the focus was on the fires, guns, sex, and violence. When spoken, the words became a meaningless extra to the movie instead of the principal pivot causing the emotions. In Shakespeare's play the emphasis was on the words spoken with passion, lust, revenge, greed, and hate. The central flaw of the movie lies in its failure to reveal the greatness of the playwright's words."
5,Shakespeare has never been sexier!,"What a gem of a film! This movie is just stunning. Fabulous cast including Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott-Thomas and the cream of British actors. Casting is spot-on and performances flawless, Annette Bening and Ian McKellen are simply amazing. The 1930's theme is really novel and works incredibly well. Definately one for the collector."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:McKellan is diabolically good, the alternate-universe 1930s Britain setting is very clever, and the opening and closing sequences are powerhouses; the middle hour doesn't move along at quite the same pace but this is an inventive and interesting Shakespeare adaptation."
5,more enjoyable than any other play,"The movie Richard III is a unique portrayal of Shakespeare's play. This film is unlike any of Shakespeare's plays that have ever been made. Although Romeo and Juliet was made in 1996 with a modern setting on a beach and with very popular teen actors, Richard III, the movie, is quite different from any other representation of Shakespeare. Richard III is set in a thirties type of setting in England. Ian McKellen plays the part of Richard in the play and really shows the ""ugly"" side of Richard. His sarcasm and cunning lines adequately display Richard's true character, as Shakespeare intended. Despite the fact that the setting was not at all something that was expected, Shakespeare's play did not miss a beat. All of the elements of a classic Shakespearean play were there and were perhaps more enjoyable than any other play ever made for the theater."
4,Witty and wicked adaptation,"The jazz version of ""Come live with me and be my love"" still plays in my head. The director creates a fictitious but a very convincing world of fascist England. The 30s fashion is very appropriate, because it's flamboyant, gaudy and elegant at once, perfectly appropriate for a political drama. The female leads are fantastic - the innocent queen played by Annette Benning and the scheming mistress played by Kristen Scott-Thomas."
5,Smashing!,"This film couldn't have been better. It is truly a great work of art. The performances by such notables as Ian McKellen, Kirsten Scott Thomas, Annette Benning, Nigel Hawthorne, Jim Broadbent and Adrian Dunbar exceed all expectations. McKellen and co-scripter/director Richard Loncraine play with Shakespeare and all potential allusions to present day Britain (there are eerie echoes of today's young Princes William and Harry, as well as to the youthful Prince Phillip and Queen Elizabeth) and never lose their subject, but rather seem to engage the bard himself, and the audience, further. There is such assurance here that Shakespeare is still an intellectual and popular triumph that the production makes no distinction between the two. None is needed. This movie is simply one of the best."
4,Poignant!,"Poignant! This comic book version of Richard III, staring Ian McKellan, is actually an extremely profound statement about our times. Jeeps replace horses, tommy guns replace spears, and hanging replaces beheading as the setting takes place in London, swinging away the 1930s in midst of a fascist coup. Richard III is beautifully portrayed by McKellan: deformed, merciless and treacherous. The movie is teaming with sex, drugs, and violence. The style is reminiscent of the modern version of Romeo and Juliet staring Leonardo Dicaprio, though Richard III is more cartoonish: bombs explode, women ware impeccable makeup with red nails, and love is shallow. The director successfully catches the mood and spirit of Shakespeares Richard of Gloucester, all using the authentic dialogue with few cuts and making a poignant parallel between Richard and Hitler."
1,Modern Richard,"I enjoyed this brilliant film, it must be one of the finest I ever seen. The political framework of this long and complex story is perfectly detected thanks to its modern setting: the '30s in Europe are the most well-chosen time for the Richard's dictatorship. The all-star cast is perfect and each of them hits the target."
2,Not for children,"This is a picture book and it says it's for children, but I wouldn't read it to a child. Reviews call it an Orwellian fable. The pig farmer, Mary, befriends the pig and then tricks him into getting into the van to go to the market. Trust, betrayal and death. Definitely not for young children. Besides being seriously weird it has disturbing photographs of individuals holding up different masks for illustrations. I don't know if you can see the cover well from the photo here, but that's a ring of piglets around the woman's neck.Now this was a highly reviewed and very successful book, I'm just warning you that in my opinion it's not for young children despite the fact that it's a picture book."
1,"""Charlotte's Web"" meets ""Animal Farm""","Are you worried that your kids may be sleeping to soundly? That they are too well-adjusted? Then dig up a copy of this! ""Little Pig"" is a truly awful book. I have read many less-than-stellar books over the years, and this is one of only two that stand out as being the absolute bottom of the barrel. The horrific story combines with the grotesque illustrations to make an astoundingly unpleasant work."
1,You need to be an ant to read it!,"The letter is so small! It's even insulting that the publishers offered this re-print edition! Please don't buy it, unless you're an ant and can walk though it and catch something! In this sense it's really ""compact"", as was also the brain of the person who authorized it. I returned it!"
5,Good intoduction to the topic,"This introductory book gives a good overview if the lanthanide and actinide elements, including electronic structure, the ionic forms of the metals, the sources of the elements (with basic chemical transformations) and a survey of the organometallic reactions of these elements. The material is presented by element, with general sections on lanthanide trends and the transuranic elements, Am, Cm, Bk, etc."
5,Indispensible!,"Years ago running a service dept in a large NC car dealer, one of my lead technicians showed me his pocket screw driver which he claimed he used every day of his life. I since have become a strong believer in this Stanley product. It is with me 24/7. I too use it every day for opening mail, packages, as a tooth pick when needed, as a screw driver when needed, to pry or open any number of items. Not a day goes by when I use this item multiple times. I have taken to buying them in quantity and giving them as gifts to people who remark, upon seeing me use it repeatedly, that they wish they had one. Both family and customers. It is truly indispensible!"
5,Great for more storage!,I loved these so much I bought another set for my mother! She loves them too! Great product! Thanks! I use one to store my hangers on and one for the laundry supplies!
4,So far so good,I just bought this and it came today- the packaging looked dated like something from the 80's and when I opened it the rubber stoppers on the ends were a permanent shade of orange which I can only assume is a result of aging. The actual shelf is a lot wider than the space between my washer and the wall- My washing machine is in a closet that the doors fold right up to so pulling the washing machine out to accommodate the width just isn't an option. Still I have it sitting on top and so far it is working if you don't mind the big over hang. I need extra space and this is definitely a space saver! I will update this review in a couple months to give a better idea of how it is going to hold up over time.
4,Great Customer Service,"My shelf came without the installation hardware. A quick call to the 800 number on the box, connected me to a very pleasant Customer Service Rep who listened and had hardware shipped out quickly. I was surprised to receive a package via FEDEX Saturday delivery. When I buy any other organization items I'll look for Household Essentials based on mt experience with their responsive Customer Service.The shelf was easy to assemble using only a screw driver. Pliers were used to slightly bend the brackets to snugly fit my washer. I do recommend giving this item a try."
1,"PICTURE IS DECEIVING, LOOKS LIKE IT MOUNTS ABOVE DRYER ON THE WALL - IT DOES NOT","This one is a horrible design. It does not mount on the wall or on the dryer. it just sits on top of the control board (where the knobs are) and puts all of the weight on the control board (which is made to take ZERO POUNDS) the two strips that you see on the wall behind the dryer is not part of the shelf. Skip this one, or buy one and use it only to have a repair bill for your new dryer."
1,flimsy,"I am unhappy with this product, it's not a sturdy and it falls backward when you put anything that weighs more than a lb. on it. I wouldnt recommend this for heavy items"
5,Big improvement for such a small item,"This has been a great solution to the problem of things falling behind the washer and dryer. These are very easy to assemble and install. Because they are wire, you can just bend them to get them to fit as needed. We have two: one behind our washer which is flat on the back (the controls are on the front of the machine), and one behind the dryer which has the raised area with the buttons and dials. Both fit fine."
1,horrible product,"This shelf came a bit bent. After working with it for about an hour I managed to get it together. I tried to place it on my dryer. When I placed a typical sized fabric softener bottle on it, everything fell down behind my dryer. I have to throw it away and I haven't had it for a full day. Don't waist your money!"
1,Sad,The Over Washer Storage Shelf arrived with a small bend in it. It does not fit. The legs in the back are not at the correct angle and the shelf leans too far back. I cannot ues it.
2,Not what I was hoping for....but then.....,"I was trying to use this over the back of an apartment sized stove to avoid putting screws into a concrete wall.....What I didn't realize is that stoves that small do not have solid backs...in fact, they have no back at all. I tried to modify this a zillion different ways but it was never going to be stable enough for my purpose. It may be just fine for the intended use...on the back of a washer or dryer. Sorry, I wasted my money on this one."
5,Perfect!,I love that it keeps all the essentials within arms reach as I am vertically challenged ;)The shelf sits perfectly above my dryer and fits all the bottles I use most often.
4,Good buy!,"My husband had to bend this a bit to get it to fit correctly, but otherwise - no problems. It's great to have everything right at hand. I recommend it."
4,Great way to get extra storage,"I bought two of these, one for the washer and one for the dryer.This product was very easy to install. Open the package, screw the supports to the bottom, put on washer. You may need to bend/adjust the supports slightly to get a snug fit. I was skeptical about how well these would work, but I was surprised to find they are very sturdy and don't move at all.The outlets for my washer and dryer are directly above the appliances, so I did have to cut one of the wires in each shelf to be able to get the plugs up through the shelf. I used wire cutters and it required very little effort and doesn't appear to have affected the stability of these shelves.I highly recommend these to anyone to recapture what is usually wasted space."
2,"Good idea, bad design","This item is a good idea but it was not adjustable so it would not fit over my washer/dryer. Then it cost me more to ship it back than I was charged for shipping in the first place, a total disaster although the distrivutor was fast in refunding and although they do not manufacture the product, they could have explained it better, like how it works for assembly."
4,Great Solution,"My prior homeowner left one of these on the dryer when they moved out. Due to the limited storage in my house (no linen closet) I wanted a second one for the washer & so I found & purchased this on Amazon about 2 years ago.This ledge fits both my washer or dryer fine (standard build equipment with controls on the back). Your washer / dryer just need to sit away from the wall a foot or so. I took off 1 star because it isn't 100% sturdy, it wobbles a bit when I take the 10 lb detergent bottle on/off. That could be expected though just based on the way this shelf uses leverage to hold in place but ideally it would be completely sturdy. The wobble gives me the illusion that it could break.I keep 2 bottles of detergent plus some sprays & dryer sheets on it... it holds the 20+ pounds just fine and has not broken after 2 years of use.It's a great storage solution."
2,"A ""Shelf"" that hangs on your washer - maybe","I ordered this thinking it could be mounted anywhere in the laundry room. The picture shows a rail on the wall, but this thing has some metal bars that just hang off a washer. It's an awkward fit and wouldn't fit on our Fisher Paykel washer at at all because it doesn't have a back panel. It fit on the dryer, but hte shelf isn't very deep and it's difficult to get it level - a process of bending the support arms and remounting it on the dryer.Overall, it's a waste - a piece of ventilated shelving from Home Depot would have been a much better solution."
4,Its ok....,It works for my cloth diaper Rockin' Green soap and little things. I wouldn't trust anything to heavy on it. I did put a giant bottle of detergent on it but I wasn't sure if it would stay and I wasn't comfortable with it because it touched my water hose. The medium bottle in the default pic should work fine.
3,You have to have at least one heavy item on the shelf,"I saw a couple of the other reviews that talked about the support brackets, and how you had to bend them a little to work. That was a really great tip! But it still didn't hold up very well until I put something heavy on it. After a week I removed it to see if it would be fine after, but it was unstable. So as long as there's something heavy on it, it's fine.Great idea, and it may work better with some models than with others."
4,Over washer shelf,"This is exactly what I needed to store laundry supplies within reach in a small laundry room. It's a perfect out-of-the-way shelf, sturdy and large enough to hold all the products I use. The price was the best I'd found."
4,Great Shelf,"My sister has had this for years & loves it. I moved & my cats like to jump behind the washer & play with the foil venting material. This shelf solved the cat problem & allows more area for storage. You need to play around & adjust the legs to get it stable. I broke one of the legs in adjusting it but got a replacement. I bought 2 shelves & 3 of the legs were fine, only the one was too fragile. Highly recommend it!"
1,Didn't fit,I was very dissapointed that this didn't attach to the washer and dryer. My finished basement was destroyed in hurricane Sandy. We are slowly coming back. The new washer ans dryer are sitting alone so I thought these shelves would hold the necesary items till the walls and other storage back. My husband and I just couldn't make them fit on our appliances.They are being returned.
4,Nice product,Received the shelf very quickly. Very easy to put together. Took a little adjustment to get it to fit. Works really great behind myn dryer. Holds all the extras I didn't have room for before.
3,Won't work for me,Nice product but unfortunately will not work with my washing machine due to machine's design. Will pass it along to a friend though ;-)
1,Great concept - Poor quality,"I loved the idea - however, the product just didn't work. The shelf actually sticks out quite a ways from the way - so to use it, I would have to pull out my washer or dryer several inches into the middle of the laundry room. I did try that, but then I couldn't get the shelf to stay & hold even a few laundry detergent bottles. I returned the item. So sad."
2,Look Carefully Before Purchasing,"I did not take the time to truly look at what is being sold. MY FAULT. If you look at the picture, there appears to be what I thought was a support bracket across the rear of this shelf. Was I surprised (yes very) when the item arrived and there is no rear wall attached support.This shelf tries to balance/secure itself by attaching (hanging) to the control panel of the dryer and via rubber pads; friction is used for upright support. This may work on some dryers IF the control panel is the right size AND you place the dryer the correct distance from the wall AND you do not put any item of any substantial weight on this shelf.I ended up adding a rear support to this and firmly attaching it to the wall. It functions very well as it now has the ability to remain stable. The shelf itself is very strong and can support a full container of liquid detergent, softener and dryer static sheets without the items ending up on the floor behind the machine."
1,Wobbly!,"Used to have a product like this (that I loved) that attached to the wall behind the dryer...this one fits so loosely that I couldn't use it for what I need - storing detergent, bleach, softener bottles, etc....very disappointed..."
3,Like the idea,I was thinking this fit a little better on the top of the washer/dryer. It sits there but is not secure enough to put heavy things on or anything that might spill. Jury is still out on this one.
3,Did not work for my old washer & dryer,This is a nice size shelf and made nicely as well. I have a 14 yr old washer/dryer set and it did not work. It must be made for the newer machines. It wasn't even close to working in any way or form. I made use of the shelf elsewhere but was disappointed.
4,Refeshingly simple,"I also bought this from Benjamin's website. Though the production quality is not top notch, Ben's music is really good. He is just a solid musician. I recommend this to anyone who likes music. The songs are quite simple and to the point, the melodies are beautiful, and the piano parts are rich and original. Good album."
1,disappointed,"Disappointed in the writing. The first book was wonderful - this was not worth finishing. I am not sure what happened when Elizabeth Norman wrote this - it was poorly written and ended with a big, ""what?"". Made no sense."
4,Excellent general purpose holster,"Rugged holster that fits most large frame semi-autos: 1911, Beretta M9, CZ 75 and 97, Browning HP, FN 5.7, etc. This holster is designed to carry and protect your firearms from the elements. It is not a speed draw holster by any means. Perfect for hunting in rough terrain. Ambidextrous qualities make it very convenient. Also can be converted into a shoulder holster. Flap is removable as well and can be replaced by a thumb snap. Comes with a plastic cleaning rod that is all but worthless. Bottom line is that this in not a sexy holster but is the best deal for the money."
3,Water Colors Nail Enamel,"I rated this as ok. It's great to put on if you want a slight hint of pink, or use it over another polish to give it a sheen.I do not like that it doesn't last long. I go to work out in the pool at our local wellness center and find this polish does not hold up. Guess it's the bromine they use in this pool for disinfectant."
2,The electrical cords to each light are visible,I returned this because the black cords that supply the power to each light bulb are visible outside the metal arms that support the lights.
3,A Look Into the Mind of the Masters,"This is an interesting book that takes you into the mind of some of the older martial arts masters. I believe that we can learn much from the elderly. They have lived many years and have gained a lot of wisdom from their journeys. This book contains some candid conversations with some elderly martial arts masters and they give you some valuable insight into the world of martial arts.These masters actually guide you as to what true martial arts were meant to be. They discuss their lives, their journeys through the martial arts, how martial arts have changed, and what they think of modern martial arts. I found it interesting to see what these elders had to say on the subject. Although I didn't pull a ton of useful wisdom from this book, it was an interesting read.Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"
4,Perfect match,Great item and perfectly matched all of my other bathroom accessories. Although it was clearly NOT a bath rug. So I used it for my kitchen.
4,The Truth,"Terry Pratchett does his usual roller-coaster romp through the streets of Ankh-Morpork. Sadly, the place it is a-changing. But there is nothing so certain as change so it might as well get on with it in the usual AM style.The two newest central characters don't seem as strong as other characters in the series though de Worde may get better with time but he was a milchetoast to begin with so he can only get better. The vampire Otto was the best character of all and, of course, Wuzzy's testimony was a riot."
4,Great Story!,"A well woven tale of the truth being told and edited, along with Mr Dibbler and his efforts to 'bend' it to his own purposes."
3,Not his best,"Terry Pratchett Discworld novels are always a great and funny read. This one, though very funny at times - Otto the vampire who dies everytime he takes a photo, was great - on the whole I found it a fairly forgettable book. Nothing really new in the plot and some of the more difficult situations that the characters found themselves in seemed to have been gotten out of too easily, with no real suspense."
5,Back to the fold.,"Honestly, I've been a bit under whelmed by Pratchett's more recent Discworld books. This one changes all that. I loved it. I was absorbed and laughing through the whole thing. Added to the usual coolness, we get to see Pratchett's take on ""Pulp Fiction""."
5,The Truth Shall Make Ye Fret.,"The dwarfs have discovered how to turn lead to gold, which is a surprise to everyone, the dwarfs included. What they HAVE done is create a printing press. When William de Worde accidentally stumbles into their business, he lends an unwilling helping hand. Up to that point he had done nothing more than write a monthly genteel news letter for the upper class of Ankh-Morpork and sundry royalty. Of course, with the printing press set in Ankh-Morpork, it's not long before it gains the attention of Lord Vetinari, the Watch and a single young girl.Then the Patrician is framed for a crime, his dog goes missing and the city is visited by two priests - one of whom uses '----ing' all the time.I am unreservedly a huge fan of Pratchett, I don't think he is capable of writing a bad book, and he certainly didn't put a foot wrong with this one. I '----ing' love this book!"
2,An appended review....,"To be honest, I had previously written a scathing review of this product. I have decided in the light of recent events to append it. I am giving this prog 4 stars,(unfortunately, the ranking can't be changed in an appended review).If your soundcard has both WDM and ASIO drivers, this software will automatically detect the WMD's, resulting in latency probs. Manually connecting to the ASIO drivers within the program solves the problem, thus the appended review. The dxi soft synths in this prog are quite lame, and the sounds rather poor. However, it get's high marks for it's combination of low price and a very full featured loopintg and recording system. It also has great plugin flexibility. For what you pay for it, it's a sweet little program. It only get's 4 stars due to it's lack of decent soft synths, but beyond that, an excellent prog."
4,Super as Usual!,"The only recording that can beat this ""Big Bands"" CD is the ""Manilow Sings Sinatra."" Barry could have been the 'boy singer' anytime he chose to be. Too bad we can't hear more good music like Barry's renditions of these wonderful songs that actually say something with the lyrics. ""I Should Care"" is still one of my favorite lyrics."
5,"Classy, Nostalgic",I LOVE this cd!!! Especially Chattanooga Choo Choo. Wow...... I feel like I'm sitting in a jazz lounge listening to this cd. Great! Great! Great!
4,Moonlight Serenade ROCKS!,This is really a cool album if your into that big band sound and Barry Manilow. The arrangements are pretty stellar and his version of Moonlight Serendade made me cry...it's right up there with Glenn in my estimation. Thanks Beh! You did it for me once again.
2,rusted,knive set worked great for about a year. recently i noticed they started to rust. i trusted the brand name but i guess you get what you pay for.
5,my kids love it,"My 2 preschool age girls LOVE this DVD. They ask to watch it almost everyday. The best part is that they are learning Biblical theology without even knowing it. Concepts such as the Trinity, forgiveness of sin, the hope of Heaven and the Resurrection are taught through fun songs that kids will love. I find myself singing the songs throughout the day too."
5,"Touching stories, they reach out to children",This book captivates my girls. The stories communicate well and the artwork is very interesting. We are all very pleased with this book.
5,One of my favorites!,"This book has all the best qualities of children's books: Children like to hear it, parents like to read it, and both can discuss it afterwards. Very positive, useful life lessons packaged effectively and attractively for the grade school and younger crowd. And who couldn't fall in love with big, soft-looking Stillwater and his ""slight panda accent""?"
4,Great short read!,"Wonderful short lessons, easily explained in Zen Shorts. I highly recommend reading this book for a quick a-ha moment. Old lessons with novel applications."
3,good book,"As an adult I thought this was a good book and thought that they had very good little lessons to teach children. I think that as a child though they would have a little bit of a hard time understanding the book. All three children in the book had different questions to ask the panda, but he gave them wise answers to teach them how to treat others and how to be a good person. I think it was a good way to try and incorporate such big lessons into a picture book for children but it's a little to hard to understand as a child as well."
5,thoughtful lessons,"Upon my children's request (4 year old twins) we have read this book before bed every night since they received it for their birthday. The drawings are lovely and just as much a part of the story as the sweet dialogue between Stillwater the giant panda and the 3 neighbor children to whom he tells the classicly Zen-like short stories.There is a lesson or three in this book for most adults, too!"
5,Not just for zen kids . . .,"This book presents lovely and entertaining retellings of three famous Buddhist stories in a way that makes them appropriate for children from about 3 up (and way beyond). Not just for zen kids, though--these are wonderful stories for kids (and parents) of any persuasion. The panda telling the very short stories to three neighbor children is neither condescending nor preachy, and Muth ably resists whacking you over the head with the morals--when kids get the point themselves (and even young readers will),the gentle teachings will be be more meaningful. Beautiful illustrations, too--this is one your kids will bring to you to ""read it again."""
5,entertaining book on life lessons,"Stillwater the Panda makes an appearance in Addy, Michael and Karl's back yard chasing a flying umbrella before it became a nuiscence. and that is how the all met. they take turns spending time with Stillwater and he tells them each a story. The stories are profound and might need to be explained to younger readers, but yes, they should still hear this book."
5,Delightful!,"Who knew? Zen can be fun. Well, I thought so, but it sure is wonderful to come across a book with a terrific sense of humor (both visually and in the text) that also conveys values. Other reviews do a terrific job capturing what's great about this book, so I will only add that I have found this book to be valuable while trying to teach my pre-K child about managing anger and disappointment: the juxtaposition of the classic zen tale about ""carrying"" anger with the child's experience of it could have been heavy-handed, but the joyfulness conveyed by the illustrations and Stillwater's gentle, gentle guidance combine to make the lesson resonate without coming down like an anvil. We now talk of ""putting down our anger"" in our house and it has made all of us (kids and adults) more centered. A perfect, quiet bedtime read. And the covers of Muth's books, when matted and framed, make for great bedroom posters!"
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is amazing...not only are the pictures great, the story is one that you will want to read to your kids over and over. Zen Shorts has touching stories within an already creative and heartfelt book."
5,Wondeful Vehicle for Discussion with Children,"I read this to my children last evening. It resulted in a lengthy discussion about anger, giving, forgiving, wealth, and life. A wonderful book with a structure that is conducive to discussion. Divided into three parts with stories that Stillwater tells to visiting siblings, each story is an opportunity to stop and discuss."
3,"Great for grown-ups, but not a page-turner for all kids","I really love this book: it's truly beautiful, deep, and funny. But despite how much I enjoy it, it leaves my son completely cold. If you're looking for something *sure* to please a young child, I'd keep searching. Test this one at the library first, or buy it as a wonderful gift for an adult."
5,A Rare Find,"A simple, beautiful, meaningful story with rich, evocative illustrations. Am I going too heavy on the adjectives? I'm a bit at a loss to express how wonderful this book is; and I don't mean just for children. The lessons that it teaches and the beauty of Muth's watercolors are for everyone with an open mind and an open heart."
5,Beutiful Zen Moments,Finally a children's book that not only entertains but also make the child (at least my son) raise questions and discuss. I picked up the book on a wimp from the return cart in the bookstore and I have enjoyed reading it with my son ever since. We are waiting anxiously for the next Zen book from Jon Muth.
3,Everyday use,This product certainly does the trick as a standard Vitamin E supplement. It is a good buy with no frills.
1,"Garbage media, most were unrecordable","This is the first time I purchased an Imation product, and I guarantee it will be the last. Every other disc resulted in an error when trying to write to it. At one time I had a run of 5 bad ones in a row! Total junk discs, don't waste your money like I did."
4,Almost Perfect,"Most of the Palm porgamming books I've seen were written specifically for use with CodeWarrior. Happily, this one is not. True, it gives you the steps needed to create all the examples using both CW and GCC tools but it at least gives you a choice. This, I think is the best book available for beginners. I only wish the author had added a chapter on programming Tables. Oh well, 4 out of 5 stars ain't bad."
5,monsoon this is part of the three part trilogy of the first three books,I had to include it as a gift to my cousin. These novels are some of the best I've ever read
5,Great Adventure!,"Seriously, this is one of the BEST stories I have read in a long time. I know some parts of the story could be considered cliche but everything else in the story makes up for that. The story has more than one climactic event and even though it's long it never gets boring. The story takes you from England to islands off the coast of Africa, and then Africa itself, etc. It is an adventure on the ocean and land with fights between pirates and sailors and warriors. The story takes you to different places with multi-cultures and languages. There are some interesting twists in the plot. If you love to read adventure stories this is a great pick!"
5,excellent,"This is one of my favourite books. A fabulous riproaring, swashbuckling adventure. I found it hard to put this book down."
5,the ultimate adventure,This is quite possibly my favorite book. my entire familt has read it and my fiance. my brother feels he would have been one of the courtnys for sure. i could not pu it down. the novel has all of the elements to create the perfect story. i have been on a quest to find a read such as this and nothing has come close!
5,OUTSTANDING ADVENTURE,"This book will have you climbing the riggings and hauling the mains in no time. A brilliant tale of a family and their trials and tribulations. This book has it all, boys coming of age, pirates, love of a father, rivalry of siblings, and much more. If you don't read much make sure you don't pass this one!"
5,"monsoon, completely excellent reading","Because I loved this book so much, I believe I have become a Smith fan for life. I am reading ""The Seventh Scroll,"" and when finished have waiting for me ""Birds of Prey."" Sorry I couldn't have read ""Birds of Prey"" first, but because Smith is such a captivating author I don't think I will feel much of a break in pattern.""Monsoon"" is a book that cannot be put down once the reader begins it. The characters, Hal, Tom, Dorian, Guy, Black Billy, Aboli, and all the rest do not only come alive in your hands, but stay with you for days after the book has been put down. The story is not only educational (in the style of Michner) but exciting and completely interesting. This is a book I would recommend to any reader of fine literature."
5,Wilbur has done it yet again - a rip-roaring story.,"How foolish of me to think that Wilbur Smith had begun to run out of steam when he left the bush to journey to Egypt but how wrong can someone get. Birds of Prey was an aperitif for the main course that is Monsoon. How clever to have a prequel of the Courtney stories (par for the course these days) and it works. I felt cheated when the story ended, could he not have written an extra 500 pages? How long do we wait until the next book - too long I am sure."
5,Fantastic Follow on to Birds of Prey.,"ordered this from Amazon.com.uk so i could get it early and it was worth the extra exspense. Monsoon is a book that is very hard to put down,in fact it is so good i read it in 2 days (674 pages )and was left wanting more. There seems to be lots of things left hanging and hopefully there will be another book after this to cler those up. excellent excellent book Wilbur lets have the next one soon please."
4,my review,"One man, Henry Courtney, sees his four sons follow a different destiny. However, he is not there to see the final chapter....Wilbur Smith is a master storyteller. His writing is so descriptive, you can close your eyes and relive every scene with all its details. The characters are very well described and the story is never boring and always flows in a constant rythm.I really enjoyed reading this book. I took my time to really enjoy every scene the author describes and I was very sad when the book was over, because I wanted to keep on reading about all their adventures!The setting is also very exciting, with all the glamour and adventure of the trading routes between England, the Cape and Bombay.Great book, wonderful reading, very enjoyable."
2,"Well written, but predictable and annoying","There's no doubt that this is a well written book and well researched. But my main problem with it is that it is so predictable.The stereotypical English family -- where the elder son treats his sibilings awfully. The younger siblings who start out boys and become men. The oath one brother gives to another. The bad guy who we know must be saught out and killed. The passing of the torch. All of these things I've seen elsewhere. What's new here?The characters seem two dimensional to me. I've read other books by Mr. Smith and I found the charactewrs in them to be larger than life, unforgetable. This is a disappointment."
4,Swashbuckling Fans!!,"First a warning for those who will read these reviews before picking up this book. Do not read the review from Harry Odum, it's a complete spoiler. I thought this book was very enjoyable, however I found it over wordy and a little slow at times. The best part of this story is Mr. Smiths swashbuckling sceens, which are among the best in print."
1,Dorian & Tommy's Unbelievable Adventures,"A friend gave me Smith's (Assegai) as a gift. Not bad but not great.After reviewing (When the Lion Feeds) and seeing all of the favorable opinionsfrom readers, I went and got it. (Better) but certainly not worthy of allthe praise. I'm an avid reader and particularly enjoy sailing adventures,so naturally I read MONSOON. WHAT A MISTAKE! This book would make a fairly goodTV soap, such as Day's Of Our Lives, if in fact you could even follow thethe shallow and one dimensional characters and story. Don't waist your time!"
1,"Boring , repetitive and adolescent","Having read all of Wilbur Smiths books and considered him a wonderful writer, he seems to be churning out boring narratives. I thought Birds of Prey was terrible but gave him the benefit of the doubt. However Monsoon is dire. The repetitive descriptions and sex scenes are laughable and occur so often as to bore you to death. They are cliche ridden and appear to ber better suited to some cheap romantic novel. I think Wibur Smith is living on his previous great books but after two disappointments I will not be trying for a third."
5,Soap Dispenser,"I love this soap dispenser. It holds a lot and I don't have to fill it often. Also, it dispenses a nice amount. One pump will do it!"
3,kitchenaid soap dispenser,i just love the soap dispenser i got it in red cus my kitchen is red and white it looks really good and i just love kitchenaid!
5,Gracie a child yet a women,"This lifetime original movie was AWESOME. Gracie is a young women still in high school, she has 1 sister and 3 brothers. Her mom is a druggie and thinks about men and drug before her own kids. Well, the kids are eventually put with their grandma who gives the care giver money to the kids mom. When they tell Gracie that they are going to take the kids and put them into foster homes, Gracie stands up and says no. She says she will raise them. So starts the story of a young girl with her whole life ahead of her and she decides she will raise her 3 brothers. Her sister got knocked up and married. Gracie goes to school, works, and is a full time Mom. This is a story of one young girls fight to keep her family together. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE. A true heartfelt film."
5,Inspiring Story!,WOW!! I thought this movie was fantastic! We as people always think we have it bad until we hear someone elses story. It was truly inspiring to see a 17 year old girl become a woman so that she could raise her siblings and give them a life that she never had. What a strong and courageous girl she was!!! You gotta see this movie!
2,Very strange technique,"I bought this book used because of the two glowing reviews and the pretty quilt on the cover. I have been quilting for over ten years, have 50-60 quilting books in my library, and I have to say that this is the most convoluted technique I have ever seen. To make the type of block you see on the cover, the author wants you to cut dessert plate sized hexagons, sew them together with all the Y seams, then cut triangles along the seams of hexagon quilt top. Rotating the triangles you make stars. The technique is done with templates, marking, and scissors. I am experienced enough that I don't shy away from Y-seams and templates, but those stars can be made much more easily and faster by rotary cutting strip sets. If you really have a thing against rotary cutting, why not just cut the individual templates out for the stars? At least you don't have to do Y-seams and then hack all your work apart again. Very strange book."
5,Knoxy,"I was please with the seller and I had a look at the book when it got here and I'm sure my Mum will love it. There a few parts that have been marked with a glow pen in the book but I'm sure that will only help my Mum sort the patterns out, As it was a second hand book"
3,VERY hard to push,"We bought this toy for my son's first birthday. He had a very hard time making it work, and so did we! It was very hard to push, and the wooden pieces that are supposed to graze each other just enough to make the bear drum overlapped and got stuck nearly every time it rotated. Eventually, after many, many frustrated tries, we shaved down the wood pieces and now it works as it should. Very disappointed and would not recommend this purchase. Much better off with the Plan Walk 'n' Roller, which he LOVES and uses all the time."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I have a 23 month old baby, and I wasn't that impressed with the Melissa and Doug Drumming bear push toy.The bear doesn't beat its drum and twists from side to side as it was described, or at least it's not that noticeable when it does.The push handle is not as long as the one from plan toys walk N roll push toy, or like the one from fisher price corn popper push toy. My overall rating is 3 beacause I was expecting more from this toy. However, it's a wooden toy and it's cute. I just wish they would've made the push handle a little longer."
2,Not very interesting for 14-month old twins,"I had higher hopes for this toy, but our 14-month old twins aren't all that interested in it. They do pick it up and play with it (like a bat), but I think that is actually somewhat dangerous. I'm putting it away until they are a little older, hoping it will be more interesting then. Right now they don't really grasp the idea of holding it to the floor and pushing it."
5,Great sample of Bliss' best,If you wanted to try bliss here is a great starter kit to see what the talk is all about. All of them come in convenient carry-on friendly sizes too!
3,Boys on the Side Soundtrack,"Not the varied music that I expected. Some selections were repeated, which I thought was a real ripoff. I loved the movie and have for all the years it has been out."
4,Great Girl Music for all Ages!,I have loved this CD since the movie came out. It's all women singers. The soundtrack seems as if it tells a story. Great to listen to when you're alone in the car!
4,heart neclace,this was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. we both love it. it is the perfect size and looks great. the chain is thin and broke quiclky so we replaced it. she wears it every day and never takes it off.
1,Love the lowcountry!,"I love reading novels such as Dot Frank's lovely stories. After having lived in the Hilton Head area for five years, I relish being transported back to that area.She is a marvelous storyteller."
1,Not up to par,"I have read other novels by Dorothea Frank, and I wasn't expecting too much- only interesting characters and a reasonably interesting plot. The book was horrible. While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful. The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect. Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues."
4,Different type of story from this author,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was just a different type of story from her previous books. I love the author's style of writing...I know when I read one of her books that I am guaranteed a laugh! I was not disappointed by the humor just surprised somewhat by the content. She really touched on the Catholic Church beliefs on stem cell research and that was very interesting. Also, she betrayed the Italian culture very well along with some very honest healthcare issues. Well done. A good story and was hard to put it down."
3,Believe it or not...,"The basic message of the book, renewing faith in religion, is not the same as encouraging our belief in God. The characters of the Italian family is well defined and I could see this family clearly as I read the passages. However, it was also pretty cliche: mother acting as matriarach, daughter subservient to mother and husband, husband ruling the roost, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed the travel aspects of the book and it has given me some ideas for future trips. It was an okay read, but great."
3,It's okay,"Having fallen in love with Dorothea Frank Benton's Lowcountry Tales series, i must say i was a little disappointed in Full of Grace. It's a cute story but her characters just don't have the charm that i've seen through her other stories."
3,Full of Hope,"Full of Grace is about hope, testing one's beliefs and overcoming hardships. It is truly a story of hope -- winning in the end; teaching others to accept, etc. It's a nice tale, but not as inviting as the other South Carolina island stories that Dorothea Benton Frank usually portrays."
4,Love Dorothea Benton Frank,"Great story. I come from a large Italian family and felt right at home reading this book! Funny, warm and at times sad.....makings of a really good book."
4,good read,"This is the story of Grace Russo, the daughter of a traditional Italian Catholic family who is struggling with her family's dislike of her boyfriend, who they have never met (but he is Irish, after all), working as an international travel agent, and struggling with her faith - or lack thereof. I really enjoyed the first 80% or so of this book, but the ending wrapped up a bit too tidily for me. I think it would be great to have a sequel based on the priest she meets and his thoughts on the modern world and Catholicism. I do think it is a good read though, as we all have struggled with questions of the presence of God. I will probably give the author another try."
2,Disappointment,"I have loved all of DBF's previous books and looked forward to this one. It was readable and the characters were worth knowing; but, the story itself was weak and having finished it I didn't care. Usually I hate for her books to end and I have reread all of them several times. (I read a book a day so finding something new is often a problem and I reread the tried and true.) This time I didn't care that the book had ended and the feeling I had was that I had been cheated of a DBF story. The religious aspect of the plot was predictable and ultimately a total turn off."
5,Another great Benton novel,"I commend Ms. Benton on her ability to have a different storyline, but still base it in the Lowcountry. In all of her books, she gives great descriptions about Charleston, Pawley's, Sullivan's Island, etc, etc. What I like about this novel is that she centered her plot around a group of characters that were from New York, but still was able to merge them into the Lowcountry setting.I will buy every one of Dorothea's books! Go buy it and read it!"
2,Hate to be preached to and this book may as well be Sunday school,"This book was so promising, funny, super likable main character, interesting story...but then she had to go and ruin it by not only bringing god into it but bombarding the reader with lectures, sermons, and religious rhetoric. It got so bad that even though I enjoyed the characters, I couldn't finish the book. According to the author, god can cure everything from a hang nail to incurable cancer if you just BELIEVE and, given that the author believes you're thick headed, she feels the need to fill half of every chapter with preaching. Didn't notice this book being sold as Christian reading, if its not, it needs a warning label. Extremely disappointed."
4,A wonderful story for the beach,"Sullivans Island was one of my favorite books by Ms. Frank and even though I didn't think this book was as good, it was still a wonderful story. In her typical style this was a fast read, with humor (I had to laugh at the wedding scene) well developed characters and a story that contains romance and a bit of drama."
3,"great book, bad ending","I really enjoyed this book because Grace was a fun and defiant character. There's tension between her and her parents, which is entirely reasonable (and realistic) over her boyfriend. This makes for a fun story, and then you have her dealing with her family and their traditional Catholic values.Overall I had a good read, I was drawn in quickly and enjoyed the plot. I had high hopes for this book, but the ending dumped on all of that. Scientific thinking is thrown out of the window for miracles, and it becomes painfully apparent that the book is a propaganda piece for Catholicism/Christianity. The ending is so horribly cliche that it wasn't funny. It's especially disappointing after how much I had genuinely enjoyed reading the rest of the book, and I wish authors would stop doing 180's with endings. They might think it's cool to have surprise endings and all, but for this one it just didn't work. I was terribly disappointed, this book had a lot of potential."
5,"Wonderful, miraculous story!!","This is a charismatic story of a demanding New Jersey Italian family who relocates to Hilton Head, SC and their daughter Grace who lives in Charleston. The family is very traditional when it comes to expected behavior and most especially when it comes to their faith. Grace falls in love with a doctor whose work goes against their staunch Catholic beliefs. Grace is placed in the position of loving her family and Michael, the doctor, when everything they do feels like waving a red flag at a dangerous bull. When Michael faces a potentially fatal cancer, Grace is not sure if her family will support her as she supports Michael. The clash opens up grave doubts for Grace about her faith. This is a wonderful, miraculous story that will open your mind and touch your heart."
4,Comforting,"This was an excellent change of pace for the typical low-country book. The setting was not only the south, but the main character, Grace, traveled to Sardinia and Mexico for her job and we learned about the scenery and culture there as well.Yet another Frank character is stricken with cancer in this novel, but there is a completely different take. In this story, Grace, tells the story of her devout Catholic Italian family and their struggles accepting her live-in boyfriend, Michael, an Irish Atheist who works on stem-cell research. Michael discovers he has a horrible, incurable brain tumor and Grace and her family learn how to come together and handle things the way they know best. The end of the story is a little hard to relate to, but it's nice to think about and kind of reassuring."
1,Just couldn't get into it,"Sorry folks, I just couldn't get into this one. In the firs couple of paragraphs only a politician could use this many words and say this litte.Love DFB's books but this was a let down. Too many good books to read without belaboring something I just didn't like."
2,Lacking,I love DBF's style of writing. Sullivan's Island and Plantation were fabulous but Full of Grace just did not capture me at all. I grew up in Hilton Head and there was nothing I could relate to in the story about the Island. Definitely not DBF's best work.
3,What ever happened to the Low Country?,"Dottie Frank is a marvelous writer, clear, concise, funny, and she can really turn a phrase, as the saying goes. I've read all her books, usually in one sitting, and throughly enjoyed them. With Full of Grace, I had to make myself finish it. Somewhere along the way the road from Charleston to Hilton Head might as well have been Manhatten to Coney Island. The Low Country which has held her other novels together so well is just not there along with the missing characters of any depth and reasonable plot. I have no quarrel with her bringing religion into the pages, but the whole story just sags like a wet paper towel with a blue crab in it. Come on, Dottie, go home to South Caroliana and give us some more of those luscious saltwater, sweet grass stories."
2,Just didn't come together...,"DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel. Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally. This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that? That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before). The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country. That's what hooked us!"
1,Dreadful...,"I have enjoyed other books by Dorothea Benton Frank, but I thought this was dreadful. Characters weren't plausible, nor was the story line. This one is going into the trash - not even worth passing on to friends."
4,Not your typical DBF novel....but I liked it!,"This book was different from the other books written by Dorthea. The fact that the main character was from New Jersey, was Italian and Catholic was far from the normal Southern themes that run rampant in the Dorthea B Frank collection. I liked it though. I'm not Italian but I am Catholic and I enjoyed reading about the references to the Catholic religion through out this book. I did recognize the DBF humor though. I got a big kick out of the fact that Grace couldn't remember Marianne's mother's name. Classic Frank humor. I think Dorthea likes wine and loves to eat and either has traveled a lot or wishes she has. All of her books are filled with food, wine and far away places. This one in particular. The ending was very hopeful. I commend Dorthea for giving us all a little more hope and a little more faith. This is probably one of my favorites of the Frank collection. I have read them all."
5,Music destroys cultural barriers,"Ilya Kuryaki and the Valderamas is a band that disbanded some years ago, they hail from Argentina and in South America released a number of highly succesful albums gaining thousands of fans in the process. When I first heard the band, it was the song ""Abarajame"" which is a funky song with rap vocals. This was one of the first time I had ever heard a Latino group rapping, and to be honest I thought they would be a one hit wonder. Then this album was released some months later and I was shocked to hear this masterpiece. This is an acoustic set that is amazingly pleasing to the ears. Songs from the album ""Chaco"" in acoustic versions make up most of the album as well as two previously unreleased tracks. ""Ninja Mental"" and ""Hermosa from Heaven"" are love songs like I have never heard before. The production is flawless, its so crisp, its like you are their in the concert. This album is the best thing you will ever hear from this band, I recomend it 100%"
4,Kraft Easy Mac Smoothes the Hunger Attack,"The only thing better then the Kraft Easy Mac Snack Pack is the Kraft Easy Mac Snack Bowl's (Which we can't get over sea's), but both are great. I enjoy the advantage of just having to add water, heat and mix and in 5 minutes it's ready. I work on board a ship where we don't get to eat dinner much, but we do have a Microwave in our work space so Easy Mac becomes dinner. LOVE IT!!!!V/RJohn W Roth, Rmcs, USN, RET.Communication Systems Technician IV, Gse-13"
5,A favorite for snack time!,"This is a great, easy snack for when the kids just can't wait until dinner. All it takes is a couple of minutes and it's ready. The kids think it tastes just as good as the boxed Kraft Mac N Cheese.I like the smaller portions and the ease of cleaning up."
3,It's OK...,"Buy it by the box instead. The meal will be worth it.This stuff isn't that great. It's just convenient, and a time-saver.But stick with the boxed stuff. TRUST ME!3 stars."
4,It's a Pooh book they can learn to read themselves.,"POOH'S EASTER EGG HUNT gives the kids a simple story that's easy to follow, with all of their Pooh friends along for the ride. The pictures have lovely bright colors. And the words are really big for young readers. The Step into Reading (this is a step 1 book) series is such a great idea for kids. There's an introduction here explaining the Step into Reading books program. Step 1 is for preschool to grade 1 (approx.). Your child will love having his/her own books, and these make an affordable collection to encourage young readers."
5,Good reference material,"If you work in the power industry, this book is a great tool in understanding fault currents and symmetrical components."
2,"HP Managed Switch, not manageable, not 10/100/1000","This switch can be accessed via web interface but individual ports cannot be managed such as enable/disable -misrepresented. Only one port is rated at 1000GB. Buy the HP ""unmanaged"" switch that does have 1000GB ports."
2,Not worth much,"the author rambles on with his own thoughts and his own struggles, that I simply found unrelatable. I think he was trying to find himself. Should have been a diary, not a published book. So many better books out there on dealing with death. Pass on this one, it won't help."
1,china keepers,"Can't believe how cheap this product appears. The quilting is thin and, in my opinion, it is really a stretch to call these apparent unit separators, ""cushion dividers"". Four or five square inches of see-through foam sheets (maybe a 1/16 of an inch per) is not my idea of serious consideration by the manufacturer for our fine china."
2,not worth the time,"this movie, as over the top as it tried to be, was poorly executed. the comedy aspect is very jr. high and the horror scenes are few and far between. maybe it's just me but i would have liked the acting to be at least half way descent aswell. i wanted to fast forward this slow paced mockery after about an hour. i would recommend passing by this film and going straight for the movie inside. now that's a horror film not meant for the faint of heart, as someone else commented."
2,This Will Make Young Men Stay Abstinent!!!,"I bought this last year, a few weeks before I graduated high school! The reason I bought it is because the synopsis sounded pretty cool! It about a teen girl named Dawn that has razor-sharp teeth in her vagina! Every time she is raped, the Vag-teeth bite off the men's penis. She has a mean-spirited step brother who only wants to have it doggiestyle, until Dawn uses her Vag-teeth to bite his dong off! It's a pretty messed up movie! If you think you can handle it, then check out TEETH!!!"
1,Overrated...rip off of Killer Condom,"I might have had high hopes for this innovated movie because the concept seemed down right creepy. The storyline goes nowhere, the acting is not great, the characters are poorly written, the story development boring, the humor down right unfunny, the climatic ending was more limb that a flaccid member.Dawn, played by Jess Weixler, needs to go back to acting school. Her acting was very painful to watch and her character's actions made no sense. I guess the creators of the movie hope you don't ask questions, this is a movie you just have to accept as being 98 minutes of nothing. The movie leaves nothing to the imagination--it is predictable, pointless and a huge let down. My suggestions are to just rent Killer Condom, Happiness, or even Baby for an odd movie...Rent it before purchasing. I wish I had. I normally love odd movies, but this doesn't make the list...I feel like my wallet was the biggest victim here."
3,Teeth,a friend of mind told me about the movie after seeing it for myself i would not recommend to my friends
2,ok,its ok...good idea but could of been way better if it was longer and taken a lil more serious glad i didnt buy it
2,teeth,"This is one of the dumbest movies that i have ever seen. the idea of this movie was different than anything i had heard before, but the movie is not worth watching. wish i never bought it."
3,so so...but original,"Should have been faster moving with more ""revenge"" scenes. The price was right for this DVD, so you can't lose. It IS an original idea."
3,"Clever ,fun story line.","Teeth is a clever story about a very sensitive issue,one that only she and her Gynecologist should discuss.She has Vagina Dentata.A condition where she has a full set of razor sharp teeth in her vagina.As a woman I have wished for Vagina Dentata at times..""evil laugh"".It's not overdone or made so campy that it's ridiculous.But it is humorous.At first you sympathize with ""Dawn"" because she has no clue as to what is happening with her body or her condition..but as she gets more familiar with it she learns how to control it.It's like be nice to Dawn and her vagina and they will be nice to you.Be mean to Dawn envade her vagina and she will make it not so nice for you and unleash her inner piranha..It's a fun little movie that both males and females will get a kick out of it...Of course males will be more horrified than us females .it's definitely worth a watch."
1,Stream quality,"I do not have this problem with Netflix and thought I would give Amazon another shot for a few movies. The stream quality, quite frankly, sucks. I will let the movie buffer for a good while and come back to watch it. I can never seem to watch it all the way through without it pausing and buffering. It ruins the quality of the movie, interjecting with the experience. This will be my review for all 3 movies I rented that evening."
1,extreemly stupid even for a horror movie,i love horror movies however this movie was extreemly stupid even for a horror movie. If you can't sleep and want to then this is the movie for you.
2,Didn't like it.,This movie just didn't seem to ever make me feel anything but depression. It is just not that good of a movie.
1,Don't Waste your time and don't let your kids watch it!!!!!!,This movie was created by demented people!!!! It's sick!!!!It makes a mockery of women and sex and is almost pornographic.There is no redeeming value to be found in this movie...watching itjust brings one down to the base level of the absurd content whichall hinges on the severing of penises by a young girl who has teeth in her vagina!!!!!
3,Secretes Potential,"This film has great potential, but lacks in the story a bit. Most definatly could have been a 5 star flick, but a rush job puts it at 3 stars.*Reminder*This is my personal opinion."
2,A gruesome and hateful tale.,"This is the best example of misandry in a film I have ever seen, which nowadays is quite an accomplishment. There is definitely a persistent air of misandry throughout the film where all men are jerks, rapists, or molesters, who all ultimately reap brutal retribution. The one notable exception to this rule is the father; likely a concerted effort by the director to ward off charges of propagating negativeof male stereotypes.If you take joy in seeing male sexist pigs get their come-uppance, in graphic,John Bobbitt style, as the camera relishes over their mutilated genitals, than this is the film for you."
4,Definately A Different Type Of Movie,"I had read about this movie in Amazon's reviews plus other sites like ""[...]"" so it sparked my interest. A little horror, little humor, some drama so it kind of has something for everyone but overall it was my type of flick as I enjoy horror most of all and this fulfilled that that gentre. Had to imagine going thru what thoe guys did. OUCH!!! But pick it up, get some popcorn and enjoy. Have fun watching!!!!"
3,"Best line (gynecologist) ""Vagina Dentata: It's TRUE!!!""","I have been shouting this line for days after watching the movie. It is so silly I find it irresistible. The story is OK, a little un-conclusive about the origin of this phenomenon (mythology or else). Well shot, actors have little experience like many indie movies. Unusual splatter material for US audience (sex ouch!!), that's why it has been banned buy the most puritan chains. Worth renting it."
5,Lichtenstein one-ups his padre,"""Teeth"" is not a perfect narrative; it follows the old episodic horror format. That said, this is the first movie (in a while) that I was upset when it ended; I wanted another hour or more of Dawn O'Keefe justice.Nothing overly shocking or original in my opinion but beyond worth seeing solely for a few select scenes that brought me near to tears with laughter."
5,WARNING! sex changes everything,"i was worried Teeth would be a cheesy, low-budget horror movie, but it was just the opposite. Teeth, at its core, is a dark comedy, however, it has elements of horror & drama. the acting & directing are both great. at the end of the movie, Dawn seems more like a superhero rather than a monster. for any fans of Heathers or Hard Candy, i recommend Teeth."
2,Gives New Meaning to [...],"Typical B-movie you'll find late night on cable TV. It's difficult to label it a comedy, thriller, or horror movie since it didn't generate any laughs, thrills or scary moments. The movie is also quite slow and boring. It would've made a bigger splash if it were your typical ""T & A"" teen movie with lots of nudity, but then again, it's hard to get hard watching penises getting lopped off. In Russia, [...] eats you! :)"
3,Disturbing and yet funny.,"I don't know if this was suppose to be as funny as I took it, but I couldn't help but laugh many times though out the movie. It was a bit more graphic than I thought it would be. Picture quality was good."
2,"Bizarre, but a little comical",Funny to see some of the guys get what they had coming to them. Good message regarding abstinence but an odd story to tell it through.
1,Whaaaaa!?,Just plain weird. I cannot say much else except a very strange premise. The description i guess doesnt want to give away the movie.
2,So dumb...,This is so bad that it is funny......unfortunately it was not planned that way......Freud would have a field day with the writer and producer.....so sad...so bad.....
4,Awesome response to man's greatest fear and...,"Mid-to-Low-Budget does not matter for this truly Freudian male-horror/female-revenge movie. I watched in glee as nature proved Todd Akin correct that when in distress the female body fights back (note this last sentence is satire, just as is the movie being reviewed, it is NOT an attempt to be political, trollish, rape-denying or anything other than a quick-witted short lived joke; if it ends up offending you DO NOT EVEN THINK OF RENTING, BUYING OR EVEN WATCHING THIS FILM)."
3,Men Beware the TEETH!,"First off, my wife really digs this movie due to its theme of evolutionary justice.PROs:Rapists receive what John Lennon called ""Instant Karma""Made me squirm in my seat repeatedlyJess Weixler gives a great performanceExcellent direction & story (for a B movie)CONs:Painful at times to watch as a manThis is a story of true consequences for men who believe that they can turn a ""No"" into a yes with a woman out of sheer force. With so many movies allowing rapists to get a ""slap on the wrist"" for their violent crimes against women, this movie gives ""justice"" without question. All the men in this film who attempt traditional rape with our main character are emasculated literally with great detail. As a man watching this, I yelled ""Ouch"" several times. I must admit though all the male characters deserved their fate in this tale."
1,one word... dumb,"when i saw this movie for the firt time i thought i was geting myself into something unique. the concept of the movie was original and seemed entertaining, but in all honesty it was a huge letdown. there is never any explanation for what is going on and the end is really stupid. in fact, everything that goes on from the beginning until the end is really bad as well. its one of those movies that starts and then tops and you are left wondering why.to some the idea of a movie about a girl with teeth downstairs may seem silly but thats half the fun. if you hope to see violence or hear something humorous get something else. this is by far the biggest let down i have had when seeing a movie in a long time."
1,Psuedo-porn and no real horror,"I bought this used from a local store after finding out it wasn't available to rent. The story line sounded interesting. It turns out to be almost rookie-level filming, thin story line, vague insinuations (like them living near a prominently shown nuclear power plant), and then the obligatory boob shot of a teenager. Almost as scary as an infomercial, I'm glad I only spent $5."
2,ZZZZZZ,"THE FIRST 40 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE SUCKED. I THOUGHT I GOT BURNED AGAIN. AFTER THE FIRST 40 MINUTES IT PICKED UP. IT STARTED TO GET INTERESTING. I THOUGHT WHEN THE MOVIE STARTED THEY WERE CHURCH GOING TEENS, TRYING TO STAY CELEBATE. BUT IT WAS A HIGH SCHOOL. I THOUGHT THAT HOLE CONCEPT WAS SO STUPID. WHAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT RIDICULAS? I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN SHE WENT TO THE DOCTORS OFFICE FOR A CHECK UP. BUT CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG. IF A WOMAN HAS A MAN DOCTOR AND HE'S LIKE EXAMING HER, SHOULD THERE NOT BE A FEMALE NURSE IN THERE TOO? ANYWAY I GUESS IT JUST THE CONCEPT OR SOMETHING. THIS MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS BUT NOT TO MANY. IM GLAD I BOUGHT IT! NEXT TIME I WATCH IT WILL PROBABLY BE WITH SOMEONE WHO NEVER SEEN IT! THE IDEA OF THE TEETH WERE COOL. LOVE THAT SONG IN THE END... YOU DID BY CHUCK PROPHET"
1,crap don't bother,"it's slow, it's dull,they probably spent only $4.99 in fake blood, the leading actress is ugly, bad acting. man this movie blows."
1,Piece of.........,"What a waste of time! A verry dull movie with no special effect, a stupid story, it's enough!"
3,If you like this you should check out,"If you like this movie, you should check out the period. also available on Amazon here http://www.amazon.com/Period-Angela-Dix/dp/B000VD5HL8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1253074518&sr;=1-1[...]It's about Sharrie Heiman, her girlfriend Clitoria and her never ending projectile period, and came out a little before Teeth"
4,Funny... For a certain audience,"I found this movie funny. Not ""laugh-out-loud"" funny, but ""makes me smile"" funny. Some people won't really ""get"" the humor, others will find it stupid, and some people will just be disgusted."
4,"Great, but not for the faint of heart!","I had the good luck to see a preview of this movie via a friend of mine who knew that I wanted to see it. The movie is ultimately about a living example of the dentata myth. The main character Dawn is a squeaky-clean teenager who takes part in a local chastity group, & as such doesn't discover what makes her ""special"" until she's attacked. While there are some parts to it that could have been fleshed out (no pun intended), it's ultimately a highly enjoyable horror flick.Would I recommend this to a friend? Only if that person isn't squeamish. Not only is there a huge amount of blood, but the subject matter (male genitalia being bitten off) would make anyone wince. I highly suggest that if you are purchasing this for someone else that you first rent the movie to ensure that they like it. It's a great film, but it's not for everyone."
3,This was filed under horror?,"Why in the world was this under a search for horror? I find most of the film laughable. The sex ed teacher can't bring himself to say vagina and the female reproductive system is covered by a sticker in the textbooks. On what planet are there teenagers who are concerned about going to a PG-13 movie because there might be someone making out. I can understand waiting until marriage, but this movie took it to an entirely new level. They take a trip into the woods and the main character asks ""isn't this a big makeout spot?"". The answer comes back that it is day time and they are in a group so they'll police each other. REALLY?????This was a flat out comedy. If you're looking for something scary because you searched horror and you were brought here, keep looking.Best lines in the movie: ""There's dinner if you want a bite."" ""I ate, thanks""."
4,An interesting dark comedy,"Hmm, how do I put this delicately? Dawn's vagina has teeth. I think... I've said... too much. It's called vagina dentata, and was widely considered a myth (at least as far as this movie's concerned). Dawn seems to have some real creeps in her life, and can effectively exact revenge on them. Gruesome and cringe-worthy!"
3,"Unpolished, but solid indie horror film","Teeth is thoroughly enjoyable, highly entertaining, and rather creepy. The story examines a common folk fear and updates it for modern society, creating many cringe-inducing scenes. Although the film has its rough edges, for an indie horror movie, the story, dialog and production quality make it of better pedigree than many others in that category. The acting is not horrible, and the many thematic in-jokes made sure that one isn't bored, even during slow parts in the movie."
4,Teeth,This is the weirdest movie I have ever ever seen. would give younger children nightmares but its what I though it was when I ordered it
5,Only Heroes Need Apply...,"I love modern-day horror based upon ancient myths and legends..and as if puberty isn't fraught with enough difficulties, imagine having a tooth-filled vagina??!! And siblings can be rough enough on each other..but a pierced, tattooed Goth of a nightmare step-brother that poor Dawn had in Brad?? YIKES!!!"
2,fairly dissapointing,"I had heard about this movie and was pretty excited to see it. I'm a huge fan of movies that push the envelope and aren't afraid to go too far. I was disappointed in this because though the concept itself is great and hilarious the movie didn't push it to the limit I feel it could have. You could tell they wanted to but were too hesitant to really put this movie into a memorable creeper film. It's good if you're not into movies that disturb ""average"" people and if you're not used to this kind of weird ideal but it's a little boring if you are and feels kind of childish in that sense. All the killings are pretty much implied with little to no visibility."
2,Plot not dentata,"A promising concept spirals into cliché melodrama, when Dawn O'Keefe discovers that her vagina has teeth. Occasionally funny and thoroughly crude, the overall delivery just came across superficial and powerless."
3,Teeth:The Ultimate Chick Flick!,"Teeth is the story of a young girl with a slight abnormality in between her legs. While the blood and the gore are VERY good and the acting done surprisingly well, the story starts to get old before the movies over. Its like hearing the funniest knock knock joke you've ever heard...then hearing it 15 times in a row. Its great at first, but then by the end your kinda over it.Overall, I would have to say if you are a blood and gut kinda person, you ought to watch this sometime. I payed 7 or 8 bucks for it, and thats not a bad price for it, plus, there are a lot of special features so I guess I would recommended this film to most horror fans...Especially female horror fans! Haha!"
5,Makes spinning easy to understand,"After reading the chapters in this book on how to use a drop spindle, I was literally able to produce yarn in 10 minutes after purchasing a spindle & wool. Very clear and easy to understand and follow."
5,Best spinning book I've read,"This is the best spinning book I have read. I have borrowed several other books from the library, including those by Judith Mackenzie McCuin and this is the only one that I actually BOUGHT. It is definitely worth owning. I love it. Clear explanations, good pictures, and overall a wonderful spinning book."
3,Pretty Good,it's cool that this Includes quite a few songs.makes me long for the days when Pop Songs were 2-3 Minutes long as to Artists trying to fill every space on Disc.this is also the Classic Case of Genius&Miss.when Smokey&Crew Hit it's some of the Greatest Music Ever when it doesn't it's filler that unless you are a Die-Hard Fan you wouldn't even go near.but the cool thing about this set is that it showcases A ballance of a Very Creative Musical Genius.not many Artists before or since have captured the Simplicity&Depths within there Material as Smokey RObinson.
4,Good Book for Start-Up Non-Profits,"I found this book VERY helpful. In fact, I was so fascinated with it, I couldn't put it down. It was like a good novel. I immediately changed some of my thank you letters and re-did my Corporate request for funding letter. I will continue to use it's suggestions. The book is well written and not full of 'filler info', but very solid recommendations that one can put to use right away."
3,Great for nostalgia lovers and Kentucky history buffs.,"Amazon's prescribed reading level is way off! (Baby-Pre-school?) This is really two books in one: the older, earlier version of ""Huey"" is a stream-of-consciousness reminiscence about the short-line railroad which survived until the Depression in Eastern Kentucky. Stuart blends several voices and actual people/places/events in an unusually well-crafted piece about the Eastern Kentucky Railroad. The second ""Huey"" in this volume was written for children (4th-grade reading level), but has some interest for adult readers because it treats the same period and characters in a different fashion. Great family reading, especially if you are going to be in northeastern Kentucky, because you can actually retrace the route of the EKR, along highway 1."
5,A ride on the Eastern Kentucky Railway!,"I once asked Mr.Stuart what he thought of the old railway which ran past the E.K. side of W-Hollow,... he just smiled. I read this book several times when a young boy. The story is timeless! Thankfully, the Jesse Stuart Foundation began reprinting this treasure of a book a couple of decades ago. In it is included Mr.Stuart's Esquire Magazine 1937 story, ""Huey, the Engineer"". You get both for the price of one. When writing the ""Eastern Kentucky Railway"", I had to include this book in it. This is a must have book!"
5,FILLS YOU UP WITH THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS!,"A wonderful CD! I live in the tropics with sunshine and beaches all year round. So it is very hard to imagine a Winter Wonderland, but thanks to this CD, one can get into the magical Christmas Spirit right away. Kenny G has mastered the art of conveying that warm and beautiful feeling of Christmas through his music ~ definitely a Christmas CD that must be added to your Christmas Collection."
5,Best Instrumental Christmas Album I heard,Kenny G is a Great artist. I really enjoy listening to this album every year at Christmas time.
1,This is not Jazz!!!,"If you wanna buy this CD,that's cool.But be aware that this is not Jazz but a new attempt by Kenny G to sell his stuff...That's pure commercal music."
2,"Wait, isn't he Jewish?","This was Kenny G's first Christmas album. On it, he plays light jazz versions of Christmas songs, plus a couple of originals and...""Brahms Lullaby"", of all things. Kenny plays soprano saxophone, for the most part, which is the wimpiest saxophone of all. On ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and ""Silver Bells"", he plays tenor saxophone, which helps out a bit. ""Silver Bells"" is actually the best song on the CD, for what it's worth. He actually almost gets a groove on. For the most part, though, this is ""mellow"" jazz. I prefer jazz that swings, which this most assuredly does not. But if you like mellow jazz, you'll probably dig it."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Nothing more than yuppie muzak. If you want real Christmas music, check out Loreena McKennitt's ""To Drive The Cold WInter Away."""
5,"Miracles: The Holiday Album, Kenny G","I had a robbery at my home and several of my favorite CDs were stolen. Two of my favorites, Miracles and Faith by Kenny G, were taken and I could not find either of these in any store. Amazon.com came through for me and I was able to get these two easy to listen to CDs replaced."
5,Guaranteed To Put You In The Christmas Mood,"The swooping, smooth saxaphone sounds that Kenny G brings to these Christmas tunes are soooo perfect. The sweet notes are a great match for some tunes that I didn't think I could stand anymore in their tired old versions. Kenny's new versions and sound bring them to life again.I'm not a big jazz fan, but really love Kenny G and especialy his Christmas recordings. I wish I could give it ten stars."
4,An Extension of Talent,"I considered Kenny G's Miracles Album to be an unselfish extension of his gifted talent. As an amateur African American musician, I recognize how difficult it can be to give yourself in your music completely. I have always admired Kenny G's smooth, soulful renditions. He not only is a skilled craftsman on his instrument, but he appears personable and genuinely pleased to share his gift with the audience. I commend him to be brave enough to recognize his Jewish heritage, yet considerate enough to alow all populations to experience the joy, satisfying comfort of his music. Thank you Kenny G."
3,"Good, but not great","I'd really give this CD 3 1/2 stars. It had the potential for being a great CD, but Kenny fell just a little short. In his attempt to make the holiday songs ""unique"" and his ""own interpretation,"" he lost some of the traditional beauty of the songs. This is especially evident in songs like ""White Christmas,"" ""Winter Wonderland,"" and ""Away in the Manger."" However, many of the tracks are good. ""Silent Night,"" ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" an up-tempo version of ""Greensleeves,"" and ""Silver Bells"" are all very enjoyable songs. Kenny offers two original songs on this disk - ""Miracles (very pretty song) and ""The Chanukah Song."" The CD ends with a pretty rendition of ""Brahm's Lullaby,"" even though that is not necessarily a holiday song.It could have been better, but it's still solid. It'll get some play in your CD box."
2,It's amazing how many copies of this sold!,"I was working in a retail music store when this was released in 1994. My store could not keep it on the shelves! It seemed every suburban housewife on the westside of Cleveland had to have a copy of this insipid, elevator music inspired, holiday collection. I must have heard this CD scores of times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, but I barely noticed it because it's so lifeless and dull. I love Christmas music, but Kenny G's Christmas album is the kind that gives Christmas music a bad name.I will never forget the elderly man who came up to me with a copy of this CD and said, ""Man, this guy plays a horn like you won't believe!"" Kenny G? Whenever I want a chuckle I remember that line. If you're a fan of the Christmas music played in department store elevators or you're searching for a way to put your kids to sleep on Christmas Eve (however, be warned your kids might never wake up) then this is the CD for you!"
3,So so,"I am not a Kenny G fan, even though I own a few of his albums (most of them gifts given me by well-meaning people). This is about the only cd of his that I own that I can listen to. Maybe because Christmas only comes around once a year and fills me with the Christmas spirit, so I shove it in the old cd player with a few others and hit 'Random'. That way, it's not too bad at all. The best songs are ""Have yourself a merry little Christmas"" and ""Silver Bells"", both played with the tenor and not soprano sax. Don't get me wrong, I love the soprano sax... in the hands of a master, it is beautiful. Unfortunately Kenny G is not a 'master'...nuff said!"
1,You all all missing the point,"To fully appreciate Kenny G, it must be played in the sound system of either a BMW or an SUV and you must be wearing either birkenstocks or have a sweater tied around your neck."
3,"Good techniques, nice practice, but just a supplement","There's no way around it, the Princeton Review does have some helpful tips. For example, I really like their technique of ""A/D"" or ""B/C/E"" for data sufficiency (Kaplan never really gets around to making its advice in this area so concrete). It's a good idea to go through the Princeton Review resources early in order to put yourself in a good mindset for doing well. However, I do find the books light on REAL math - the math you'll need to get a breakthrough score. Definitely recommend this book for practice and tips, but not sufficient if you want to go more deeply into math concepts to break the 700 barrier."
2,This book contains several errors,I decided to use this book as a supplement to a prep class I took. I was extremely disappointed to find that the book contains content errors. I am halfway through the book and I have already found 2 errors. If I had not already studied for the GMAT I would have gotten these problem types wrong on the GMAT. This book is also does not show you how to shorten your computations. I think this book is only good for a refresher and should be accompanied by a more thorough guide.
3,Helpful but watch for typos,"The book was very helpful for advice on handling data sufficiency questions. However, it also states that Positive*Positive=Negative in the box at the bottom of pg 46. It then has an example of how untrue this is next to the writing. Seeing this significant of an typo decreased my confidence in the rest of the basic math explanations in the book."
2,it is obvious why this book gets such great reviews,"Of course all parents want to believe that each of their kids is special, blah blah blah, and so they rave about a book which tells them that.Yes, there is a basic message here useful for parents and educators-- don't treat kids the same, duh.And while the author seems like a great person, and the book is well written with lots of nice stories, I was very disappointed in (a) the lack of scientific facts (e.g., predictions based on tests and research to show predictions were accurate) and (b) a list of options for your kid if they profile a certain way.It would be great if there were a simple test one could take to score yourself in each of the N (here, 8) main functional areas of the brain, and then tell you what careers would be best for you, to maximize your unique profile, leverage your strengths, and minimize impact of your weaknesses."
2,Highly overrated,"Mel gave a presentation at our school a number of years ago. He was am impassioned, motivational speaker. Last year this book was required reading for all the teachers at the school where I am employed. Most of us did not read very much of it because we were put off by the book. In fact, there is a running joke among the teachers that Mel really thinks ""there are no lazy students"". Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of literature research. Personally, I think that Howard Gardner's work on learning styles is far more useful that Levine's."
1,Mel Levine is an idiot,"I found this book to be insulting to children and to educators. This man obviously has no idea what he is talking about, his ideas are strictly from the deficiency model of student underachievement which has been shown to be a faulty method of explanantion. Any educator who reads this book and takes it seriously should be relieved of their jobs ASAP.In addition, his physical descriptions of his patients are bordering on perverted."
3,"Good Information, but no practical help","I read this book with the idea that I would get some help in knowing how to help my son with some of the learning challenges he has faced. The book was very informative about how the brain works and different learning styles and challenges. However, there really were no exercises or concrete advice about how to work on the different problem areas. Only general advice was given, nothing specific to the individual problems. It made me feel as though the author wanted us to buy the book to know all the whys, but he didn't want to undermine the therapists' ability to make a living by giving us the 'hows'. It frustrated me because I already know where the problem areas are.... what I wanted to know was how to practice overcoming them. The book did not help me here."
4,How to make the very best use of your mind.,"Mel Levine has written a most inspiring book for parents and teachers. So many of us focus on weaknesses instead of the unique talents and abilities of our children. As a parent dedicated to supporting the best interests of my children, I must recommend another book here called Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self by Rosalene Glickman PhD. Dr. Glickman, who was a school teacher for many years, understands from first-hand daily experience how children learn best. She teaches you how to use Optimal Thinking to be your best, make the most of your own thinking, and the thinking, special talents,abilities, and learning experiences of our children. Optimal Thinking is simple immediately useful, and life-optimizing."
1,Pediatrician in Abuse Case Killed Himself,"I was reading another book ""Revealing Minds"" by Craig Pohlman, and it was forwarded by Dr Mel Levine. I have not read this book, but please keep in mind that Levine has committed suicide for molesting boys in both Massachusetts and North Carolina. It is hard to believe that someone is known to be an advocate for children with learning disability turn out to be the one who destroyed children.[...]"
4,A must-read for parents,"Dr. Levine has a logical, common-sense approach to education and learning. Why do we expect children to be experts in all subjects, when we wouldn't think of expecting the same of adults? Any parent who wants to be an effective educational advocate for his or her child would do well to read and absorb the philosophy presented in this book. I gave it four stars instead of five simply because I found it somewhat dry reading in places. But on the whole the language is straightforward and the ideas excellent."
4,Excellent book for teachers and parents,"This book helps you identify the issues that are holding your children back, how to prevent labeling and how to identify their learning style and promote their strengths. It can give you general information about how to promote a healthy emotional development. I would couple this book with practical application through a book entitled Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading. The result of combining the knowledge from these two books will be happy, well-rounded children and peaceful parents."
4,Thank you Dr. Levine,"I loved this book because I believe that every child is unique and I appreciate being reminded about the complexity of the brain and why it should be expected that we all have little quirks. Educators can sadly have blinders to differences in learning style. Mel Levine's work reminds me of Howard Gardner's in many ways. I sense that he truly cares about kids and I like that he supports what is best practice in education. Levine says he can learn more about a child by getting to know that child than by reading a list of test scores........let's hear it for that! Levine says, ""sometimes you fix a weakness by pursuing strengths."" I support that positive approach. To enhance my teaching I found many great quotes perfect for Back to School night and parents who have borrowed his book have enjoyed it immensely."
5,Very informational,This is the best book ever! I wish that I could have read it years ago. As a teacher it has given me a greater understanding of many of my students. I think it should be required reading for all teachers!
4,Good reading to understand how a mind works,"The book illustrates how the mind of a child works and learns. It is clear and well written and can be also entertaining. It applies to children with or without learning disabilities. The main thesis is that for better or worse, everybody is afflicted by a learning disability, even if that can be minor and didn't give rise to any problem at school. Defects can be unnoticeable and go undetected. Sometimes those problems lies in unexpected places. We can develop, consciously or unconsciously, strategies to come around those little difficulties. However, the book does not provide practical guidance to detect those difficulties or to cope with them. It provides an useful background but not a roadmap. Sometime the author comes up with commonsensical advise. However, it is a very good starting point."
5,My Best Advice,"This book is a must read for educators and students alike. And I mean ALL educators and students. You will be grateful for the information and advice. I am. And, I must say, I am also grateful for the advice of a previous reviewer who recommended that, after I read Mel Levine's great ""A Mind at a Time"", I also read Norman Thomas Remick's ""West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education"". It WAS an education. This is my best advice."
4,Great book,This is a wonderful book that emphasizes the need to look at the individual needs of students.
1,objectional last page,"This is a very cute book- UNTIL the last page. I don't want to read to my children: ""the bear pooped on my bed""."
4,Reaching Back,Reaching Back is a great read! You'll think about your own family history as you delve into the characters and gain insight into some of the internal issues we have. I look forward to future titles by the author.
5,Fine piece of work,"I enjoyed this story immensely. With a journal in hand, she writes so beautifully, tracing a family that holds secrets and pain. That ""color"" thing that has been a thread for as long as black people set foot in this country is well woven in this fine, fine story.Loved it!"
1,Reaching Back To Far,"Nea Anna Simone reached back to far in this book. I got confused trying to keep up with all the characters and who's who. This book could have been broken up into about four differnt stories.The book had a good plot, just to much cramed into one book."
1,DOESN'T WORK,"This item DID NOT FIT my HTC Cingular 3125 phone. It ALMOST fit, which make it about as useful as... well a charger you can ALMOST plug into your phone. Unfortunately I did not discover the defect until past the return policy date. Thankfully it was cheap enough it is mainly just an annoyance, but I'd hate for others to waste the money on shipping like I did."
4,Remarkable - Bringing the avant garde to the masses,"If you already have Volumen (the first part, previously issued) this DVD is the perfect supplement to catch you up on what has happened since. The videos are fresh, somewhat daring and visually stunning. This is not you regular MTV ""dime a dozen"" video. Bjork, once again, teams up with true visual arts masters and brings us video art worthy of university level discussion in art classes. One of my favorites here is ""All is Full of Love"", simply one of the best ""music videos"" made. The effects are amazing, the narrative simple, and probably one of the most sensual scenes of robots on film."
2,Doesn't contain any DJ sets..Not very good,"Universe tribal gatherings are legendary.....however this CD is NOT!! It doesn't contain any Dj sets, all it contains is 1 CD with 14 Tracks unmixed. A complete and total let down considering the line up on the front cover. My advise is to AVOID unless you want to waste your money."
2,Avid Burns' film fan.....,"but this film is certainly not one of his better films. Boring and predictable. Having seen just about all of his films, this one is sorely lacking. Hopefully Mr. Burns will get back to his well-known abilities as a writer and film director/producer/actor. Looking forward to his next adventure."
2,Annoyingly unrealistic,"There is no chemistry whatsoever between the nerdy leading man here and the two women who supposedly want him: his demanding fiance and the blonde tennis instructor who tempts him during his weekend in the Hamptons. Matt Bush as the sports talk show host is annoying throughout with his insistence on always being 'nice,' to the point of complete absurdity. In this movie, everyone else is doing what they want except him, only he can't see it. The problem is the part is overwritten, so it all comes across as relentlessly unlikely. The fact that he is also about a foot shorter than either girl doesn't add to the situation. Watch if you are desperate."
3,Good for $.99!,"This was a really pleasant, happy-ending little movie for when a person just wants to ""feel good"" about the ""human nature"" of a ""nice guy""!"
3,Pixelated?,"Am I the only one who notices that the movie is all pixely looking? It's easy to notice on words, and objects that are not close up. But the movie is good. It's not anything amazing, but it doesn't suck."
3,Interesting watch for film enthusiasts and filmmakers,"I purchased this out of intrigue as I had heard about the movie, specifically from the point of view of how Ed Burns shot it on a very tight budget, with no name actors in the main roles and then released the movie himself, with success. So I was interested to see what had been produced under these circumstances and in my opinion, the movie is definitely worth a look. There's some good acting and then some not so good acting, but overall it is enjoyable. Don't know that I would recommend spending $20 on the DVD but if you can rent it or purchase a used copy that would be best."
3,better than the one on the disney site,"if you're looking for a davey jones re-enactment, this could be your answer. the product is a little transparent, sort of jelly-like though, not like the more ""matte"" look in the picture, but definitely better looking than the one on the disney store."
5,"Frequent flying may be hazardous to your health, book warns",Fearful fliers worry mainly about plunging out of the sky. But dozens of other health and safety threats confront air passengers every day. Many of them are detailed in Broken Wings.The author's tale of one person's struggle against the system makes gripping reading. But interwoven with it are facts and figures on the dangers faced by flight crews --- and by extension their passengers -- on a daily basis.
1,No wonder she couldn't get a publisher,"A self-published, wildly exaggerated rant. The book does not represent a true picture of the airline industry, and it is very, very poorly written. The humor is unintentional -- for example, on page 308, the author extols the virtue of her book: ""Annemarie, jubilant, with tears in her eyes and beaming brighter than the morning star, exclaimed, 'Now you're free to publish Broken Wings and perform a service to humanity!'&quot."
1,Government bashing in print.,"It is the story of an injured flight attendant (psychological injury) and her 10 years of trying to get the government to provide disability to her. At times the book bashes the Candian Government, the insurance industry, the unions and the Aviation Industry.I read the entire book hoping that somehow all the side stories and negative comments would end in a conclusion worth reading about...but it did not.It is just not worth your time."
1,There is a MORE cheery Flight Attendant book than this...,"This book is kind of a downer, especially compared to the new book I've seen at Amazon, called Flying by the seat of my pants: Flight Attendant Adventures on a Wing and a Prayer. (That author, lets you read a free chapter on her website). If you love the idea of flying around the world, like I do - it's kind of cool to read a book where the Flight Attendant loves her job."
1,flying drivel,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. I think this author just wanted to quit her job and this was her way of quitting and still getting paid. I also think she must have been turned down by a lot of pilots. I don't know any, but I'm sure that if they are as crazy as they say, the MOT would have found them by now. Drinking I can believe. Crazy? I think the author is the pot calling the kettle black. Sorry, but don't waste your time"
5,A MUST read for anyone considering a flying career,"Excellent! I am so appalled at the airline described in this book, the flight attendant union involved, and the Canadian Worker's Compensation Board. I'm an American and if this had happened to me, I'd have gotten a lawyer to begin with.My hat's off to Nattanya. What a wonderful person for sharing her story! It is so well researched and full of facts. It made me reconsider my dream job as a flight attendant.I hope Tanya can and will go to work for another carrier someday -- prefarably not a Canadian one....And, to Adaria: As an emergency responder, I have suffered from PTSD and know all too well what it is like. Just pray it doesn't happen to you. Shame on you for passing judgment."
2,Disappointing,"This a great book, so why the 2 stars? The book states on the cover that it is a revised edition complete with 1/96 scale fold-out plan. Well when they revised the book I guess they took the fold-out plan ""OUT"". I couldn't find it. I bough 4 books in this series and they all say the same thing but NO PLANS. If it wasn't that the other information in the book is great I would have returned all 4. Still a disappointment."
3,"Pandora, 24 gun Frigate",Modately interesting and informative. Many diagrams of the structure and rigging of the ship of the line. Good for any serious model builders.
3,It would be a great movie,"While there have been similar books , this is a very well written first hand account. It is a testament to the human spirit and to the cause of freedom. This is the type of book which should be required reading in school or that should be the subject of a movie. It would be an instant success!!"
2,"Not enough tutorials, often too vague","Having used books to learn a few programs, I feel the best way to learn is through tutorials, things you do as you read along. This book, however, often gave examples I couldn't really follow along with because I don't have the graphics or other tools he's using or he didn't explain how to construct them myself. Too many of the keyboard commands for Windows are incorrect. I found myself just trying any keyboard combination I could think of to figure out what the author meant to write. He also tends to explain the most complicated, roundabout way to access things in Photoshop. I often found an easier way myself or by looking in another book. Many of the links are incorrect (though probably updated in the new book). The last two chapters are useless and read as though tacked on in a hurry. Don't expect to learn how to get something on the web from this book. It only teaches the very basics of Photoshop. Alas, it's dry as stale toast."
1,Waste of time for intermediate to advanced users,"I do not recommend this book to anyone who has ever used Photoshop or designed a web site before. If you don't know anything about Photoshop or web design, than this book might be for you. However, if you want to learn Photoshop I would buy a different book. This book is very basic, so if you know anything about Photoshop than the first half of the book is a waste. I consider myself an intermediate user of Photoshop and I didn't learn a single thing from this book."
2,"A 4 star book for beginners, no stars for int/advanced",This would be a good book for someone who has NEVER created a web page and never worked with photoshop. However for anyone who has it would be a waste of time. The first 14 chapters (400 pages) could be called photoshop 101. There is one chapter dedicated to web graphics and one for basic HTML. This book is rated at an intermediate/advanced level but SHOULD BE LABELED FOR BEGINNERS. I consider myself intermediate and learned nothing from this book
1,a mistake buying decision,It's only waste of time. Buy Adobe Photoshop 5.5 classroom in the book instead if you really want to learn how to master photoshop!!
3,Bride of Suzuki? Not really...,"After being blown away by Opera, and rather pleased by Suzuki, I was figuring this album was a sure thing. Knowing that this would be a remix album, I was hoping to hear some exciting new interpretations of the original tracks. This logic would follow from my experiences with the ""Beep"" remixes of Tranquility Bass, where I actually preferred the remixes to the originals in some cases. However, I feel that in this case the original is a superior album, and this new collection fails to be a worthy companion to it. While some of the tracks do not even capture the spirit of the originals (which is not really a sin in remixes), none of them provide a radically new or interesting interpretation of Tosca's work. This album is certainly a relative of Suzuki, but is not the marriage of Tosca and other comprable artists that I was hoping it would be."
3,*Not as good as the original*,"These interpretations of Tosca's stunning second album, ""Suzuki"" fall short of the original. But hey, the bar was set pretty high in the first place! Start with the real deal, then you can try this out."
4,alot easier to get into than the previous,"i likedthe previous album, dont get me wrong, but i only listened to about 2 or 3 of the songs off of it, over and over. this album however there are many different types of music to listen to i usually skip around, alot of the songs are good, but still again, i probably listen to 4 or 5, off the whole cd, there are a coupl i can't stand listening to, but hey its gold chains. i'm still going to buy their next album even if its more of the same."
3,California love,"On this sugary potpourri of hip hop, house, 2-step, and indie rock, Gold Chains raps and Sue Cie sings about love for humans and California. Few songs stand out, though, and in a world of Matthew Dears and Postal Services, stronger hooks are necessary to cut through the mix."
5,Really Good,"I bought this when it was at Tower Records on South Street (yes, the street in the Orlons song) in Philadelphia.This is great stuff, most of it is obscure and hard to come by, just take a listen to the sample sound bytes provided above.One gets the true feel of those earlier, more relaxed and simpler times with this eclectic collection of period jazz and swing.As is apparent, the scary theme adds to the over all enjoyment of this music and you'll find that this is delightfully NOT the jazz and swing you've been accustomed to hearing.As a previous reviewer has said before me, GET THIS IF YOU CAN."
5,Timeless Classic!!!,Just to hear Smokey's rendition of Wichita Lineman will make you feel it in your bones. Just feel it!!!!
3,PLEASE I NEED HELP,HI MY NAME IS MARLENE ANDI NEED SOME HELP SO COULD SOME ONE HELP PLEASE I'M LOOING FOR A SONG BY SMOKEY ROBINSON IT'S CALLED YOU NEGLECT ME I CANT NOT FIND IT NO WHERE AND I'M TRYING TO DOWNLOAD IT SO CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME THANK YOU
1,Moisture Problems,"This watch has been around for a long time and it's great for distance runners (big numbers, big buttons). My first one died earlier this year and I bought another one. After one run, the face fogged up and eventually the LCD died (within one day). I returned the watch and got another one, and first day out with it exactly the same thing happened. I think that there is a design or manufacturing problem with the current run of these watches. If they fix it, it's a great watch; if not, stay away."
2,Do you know how to sew?,"I received three of the Babies R Us brand towels with the cute animals on the hood (this is just an example of one of them, they've changed the animals). Only one held up in washing. Within the first three washings there were holes in the seams of the other 2, mostly where the hoods are sewn to the towel. I used my sewing machine to repair the holes, but I still had holes from washing until I just stitched the entire hood onto the towel, reinforcing their stitching. My son is now 1-1/2 and we use these three towels rotating for every bath. We haven't had problems since I reinforced the stitching in that first month. If you don't know how to sew, don't get these towels. On the good side, they are absorbent and thick."
3,It's ok - but for the $$$ buy Oil of Olay,It works ok - it doesnt control the oil as well as it should and I have found that Oil of Olay for Sensitive skin works much better for a fraction of the price
3,He should not have published the second half of the book,"Ambrose was at his best as a historian, not so good as a polician and cheerleader. In the first half of the book, he was doing what he should, talking about history. The writing was excellent and the comments insightful. After the WWII part, the book lost its focus and became a hybrid of anecdotes, memoir and political cheerleading.By the way, it's ironic to see the typo in the book's title while the author is considered a serious scholar. But it perhaps is not his fault."
5,Stories from the Greatest American Storyteller,"Who said that great storytellers had to tell original stories? Stephen Ambrose is more than just a historian, he's the storyteller of America. He doesn't write history books, he writes the stories of Americans during historical times, which is far better than any academic book on anything in US history. Ambrose finds the common man inside of the role players in key events in US history and provides his own personal insight as to what we as Americans can learn from them. I suggest this book to anybody who is looking for inspiration in American history. Thank God Stephen Ambrose was alive."
4,"I laughed, I cried, I gained new respect ...","I'm not sure I've ever encountered a finer culmination of a person's life's work than this book. Not only was Stephen Ambrose a master story-teller, but the life he led himself in pursuit of the huge body of knowledge he passed on to us was a fascinating tale in itself! The humanity he exposed about himself, is just as interesting as that which he has given to us about his historical subjects over the years. Once I picked it up, I barely put it down for two days because it was so compelling!"
2,What a Rough Draft Reads Like,"As hard as it is for authors to get into print in the first place, you really can't fault them for riding on their reputation once they've finally made it.So it is with this, a disappointing effort, which mixes ""Greatest Hits"" excerpted form his other books, a semi-biography, and some personal opinions. It reads like first draft, highly disorganized, with clunky prose. The ""borrowing"" issues of Ambrose's career are not addressed, but for an interesting experience, read his chapter on the Battle of New Orleans in conjunction with Theordore Roosevelt's account.Very sloppy editing and fact-checking. Two major boners that jumped right out: US soldiers did not carry BARs in Kosovo, and the MacArthurs, Arthur and Doug, were the first father and son to win the Medal of Honor."
3,Amateurish,"Ho-Hum, not his best by any means. I found his sick sexual comments distracting, added nothing and below that of someone with his credentials."
4,Beautiful pics,"I like the Eyewitness Travel Guides mainly because, when planning a trip, I get more excited about it just looking at the pictures I will be seeing in person. These guides have beautiful photography. There was great information in the Hawaii Guide, although I was surprised to find no mention of Nawiliwili, Kauai, where our cruise ship docked. I know others who have stayed there as well, but didn't find mention of it. However, the information was helpful and it was great to find places in Hawaii that were not gouging the tourists for all their money! The book helps with that."
4,"Very helpful guidebook, nice photos, needs to be updated.","I always use the Eyewitness travel books when I travel to new places. These books are concise and very reader-friendly. The Hawaii guide was extremely useful in planning our honeymoon in Hawaii: we used it to plan all of our activities and were very pleased with the results. Some things are outdated (such as times of Lu'au on Kauai), but overall this book is great."
5,Essential information for a good trip,The DK eyewitness guides are the best. If you tried one forget all the others. Very well organized and easy to use.
2,Too thin for a big trip,"i was warned by other reviewers that this book wasnt big enough to really use on a long trip. the photos were nice but i wanted a more dense, comprehensive guidebook so i returned for Fodors. Good luck"
4,Get your kids excited about your Hawaiian vacation!,"We were going to Hawaii and needed guidebooks. My 10 year old daughter went with me to the bookstore. There were three shelves of books about Hawaii! I asked her to look at some, and I looked at some. She disliked all of them except this DK Hawaii guide. I want my children to have a lot of input into planning family vacations, so if you do too, this is a great guide for your kids. They should be able to read at about the 4th grade level or higher. Among other things, my daughter found a once-a-year Hawaiian rodeo that we will be lucky enough to see during our vacation. Yee haw!P.S.: Later, I found out our public library also has several copies of this book.P.P. S.: I do not think this should be this ONLY Hawaii guide you use."
3,Lukewarm,"I have just one problem with this book and that's with what good guides normally do: provide more than just a few sentences about a place. For me it was too casual. I bought it in too much of a hurry, an impuse buy."
2,Too bad,"I am a big fan of Dorling Kindersley Travel Guides, so I was greatly disappointed when I received this pamphlet sized guide to all of Hawaii. It contained slightly more information than I would expect from airport brochures on arrival. With roughly 10 picture covered pages per island, the guide is attractive, but not very useful."
3,Love the photos at least,"This book leaped out at me when I was in a bookstore the other day looking for books for our upcoming honeymoon to Hawaii. The pictures sold me. They're beautiful and most of the other Hawaii guides weren't so visually appealing. But the iinformation contained in the book was dissapointing. It was as skimpy as some of the bathing suits worn there! I'm going to buy or order another book or two to supplement this one. This will be the one I dream over, and the others will be for good solid practical info and advise."
2,Just plain bad,"As colourful and glossy this is, it would be a plain waste of money to buy this Eyewitness guide. DK does publish some excellent books, but this is just not one of them. As DK is traditionally weaker in hotel and food recommendations, it usually more than makes up for it with impressive content mixed with beautiful pictures. This is not the case in Hawaii, however. Coverage of each island is a maximum of 30-40, more realistically 15-25. At 208 pages, this guide seriously falls short of expectations. Try lobbying DK to make a much better Hawaii guide the next time."
2,"Too short, too high level","We own about 15 of the DK Eyewitness Travel guides, and have dogeared the pages over several trips. They are amazingly useful.But this one is not their best effort. Hawaii is a very diverse place, and to try and ""hit the highlights"" in a travel guide is a mistake. This book is right at 200 pages, but almost 80 are about Honolulu, Wakiki and Oahu, leaving only 120 pages for all of the other islands. Even the pieces about Oahu (with little info about the west coast/Makaha and just a mattering on the North Shore) and Honolulu (with a few measly paragraphs on Pearl Harbor) is scant.As I said, I love the DK Eyewitness series, it is the first travel book we get when going someplace new. But for Hawaii, there are several other books more in-depth. If you are going to Maui or The Big Island, I suggest getting Maui:Revealed or Hawaii The Big Island: Revealed (each 300 pages, pictures, maps, etc.)"
3,Nice photos,"Not the book for you if you're wanting detailed information about hotels, restaurants, etc."
3,Quirky but fun summer read,"Many of the reviews I read about this book called it ""charming"". I understand why some others would label it as charming, but I think that potential readers should be advised about the language, the explicitness of some scenes, and some of the lifestyle choices characters make in the book including drug use, alcoholism, and one night stands between adults and teenagers. Those parts I did not find so ""charming"". I was disappointed in a lot of the moral choices the characters were making. However, the bad choices and sad lives were redeemed in the magical setting of an Irish cheese making farm by the book's end. Overall, I really did like the book, but in the first few chapters I wondered what I was getting into. It was certainly unusual and quirky and a fun summer read. There were lots of surprised throughout the story to keep me guessing."
2,Absurd,"This book stretches reality to the point of absurdity. I won't give anything away, but something happens at the end of this book that I find completely improbable. Also, I don't particulary enjoy romance novel type sex scenes, of which there are a number in this book. I'm very suprised at the high customer rating of this riduculous book."
5,"Heartwarming, funny, with a dash of Irish blarney","""Blessed are the Cheesemakers"" is a must-read for anyone with a sense of humor. It is a delightful story of relationships, growing up, growing old, being in love with life and each other. I cannot recommend this book enough - especially to anyone who loves Irish wit, has Irish relatives, and/or loves a good laugh."
3,Afternoon Fun - - Cheesemakers,"Had to read this book as a book club pick, and thought it looked a little lame (best review on jacket was by Cleveland Plain Dealer), but of course I was going to read it, reluctantly. Well, I was in for a surprise! Though it is nowhere close to great writing, it WAS one of the more enjoyable books I had read in a while. The people were interesting, the world of Ireland and cheese were wonderful, and I felt good when it was over. Sometimes, that is exactly what we need in life - - kind of like a good chick movie."
4,No disapointment,"I was pleased with the quality of the book and the timely delivery. Blessed are The Cheese Makers was recommended by a friend and a wonderful read full of romance, intrigue and cleverly weaved plot. It also made me want to visit a cheese making countryside farm to sample the various products produced."
4,Good Book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The unique story-telling of alternating characters was difficult to adjust to at first, but after a while I appreciated the different perspectives. I enjoy upbeat books that encourage me to believe in magic again! Fun read!"
1,Disappointed,"The book reviews I read before purchasing this made it sound like a tender, charming love story with quirky characters. Unfortunately, the first few chapters turned me off completely. I feel the literary pornography was unnecessary and took away from the book's other praiseworthy qualities."
4,I read it twice,"Ah, it was a good book, so it was. The two old Irish Duffers, especially ""Fee"" stole the novel; as, perhaps, they were intended to. Pregnant dairy maids aside, good cheeses begin with good milk, so the author says. I believe it! I can almost taste that Kilarney Gold! I think the Princess Grace (Blue) would be a bit too much for me. Blessed are the Cheesemakers was such a visual read for me that I would like to see it made into a movie."
5,A delightful book!,"I picked up this book based solely on the title, because I am a cheesemaker, and I thought it was hilarious that there was a book whose main characters are cheesemakers. I absolutely loved the characters. Corrie and Fee are so wonderful, if they really existed, I'd hop on a plane to Ireland to meet them.I also want to comment on the use of the word ""romance"" used by other reviewers in reference to this book. They obviously have never read a book in the romance genre in their lives. This book is NOT a romance, although there are love interests. The main focus of this book is not a romance. This is a book about two cheesemakers who need to find someone to take over their business before they die ... and you see, not just anyone can be a cheesemaker in their eyes.While I would have said that cheesemaking is a blend of art and science, Corrie and Fee would also add a bit of magic to the mix, and that creates a delightful story!"
4,Where you belong,"This is a funny book and an easy read, however it still has a strong message within. There are several main characters, all with a host of problems, some quite humorous. As the book progresses, the situations become more and more outlandish. In the end, however, the true meaning of the outcome is sincere and down to earth. Each character ends up right where he or she belongs. In Corrie's ""final words"", we realize that what one accomplishes in a lifetime may not be what one expects, but it is worthwhile nonetheless, and especially if one has done exactly what made him/her the most happy. What you do with your life doesn't have to be huge to have an impact, it just has to be what you believe in."
5,Kids loved it,"Our kids love the donut man, it is clean and fun, and even though it is a old movie my kids watch it over and over."
5,love these!,my grandchildren absolutely love these! the keep them engaged and love watching them. I highly reccomend these videos to all
5,A moving story of a woman's forbidden love...,"They were going West, the courageous young Elspeth and her beautiful but ailing married sister, leaving their civilized life in Boston for the uninhabited unknown. Elspeth told herself they were going for her sister's health, but when she looked into her brother-in-law's eyes she saw greed....When they finally arrived near Santa Fe, Elspeth became friendly with Maria, a young Navajo girl captured and working as a slave. Through Maria, Elspeth began to respect the ways of the Navajo-and to be sympathetic when Maria's brother, Tall Man, swept into the village to rescue her....From the moment Elspeth saw Tall Man, she could not get him out of her mind. She knew she would follow him to the ends of the earth, and that she would forsake her past to embrace the man and Navajo people, she had fallen in love with forever....back of book"
5,worth reading again and again,"I basically have to say this novel was excellent.I have read it 3 times and I know I'll read it again.The story is less of a romance,by the way,and mostly about the Navajo People.All the characters are 3 dimensional and realistic.It totally swept me away, making me feel right there,building the mud huts and weaving blankets right alongside them.Sabina Grant is a pen name, I can't remember what other names the author used."
1,Radiotime DISCONTINUED SERVICE,Radiotime was a 5 Star service when I used it for about 3 years. BUT! It has been purchased by Tunein.com and is NO LONGER SUPPORTED.RECORDING Radio programs for audio files to be listened to later is NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
4,Wallace stainless flatware,"This is very attractive flatware which would be compatible with many styles of dinnerware. My only reservation is that it is rather light in weight for its appearance, and I wonder how it will hold up longterm because of this. Otherwise, the style, finish, and usability are high-quality."
5,very nice flartware!,"Nice weight - has a quality look and feel to it. arrived perfectly packaged and flawless. Extremely happy with it - excellent value - the ""bonus"" chest is also very nice."
2,Wrong order for silverware,"The item I ordered, Wallace Corsica gold accent 65 piece stainless steel flatware, was not what was sent to me. The order said that was what it was, and I ordered it specifically because I had a set and wanted to add to it. The set that was sent was nice, and it was similar, I kept it because for me it was a hassle to return it. I wanted it for Thanksgiving dinner, I fed 24 people and wanted a matching set, but I just used both. There was no phone number to call to explain, which was kind of frustrating."
2,Wallace Gold Accent Corsica stainless flatware,I too ordered this stainless to add to a set I already had. It was similar to my old pattern but was much lighter and did not have the rounded edges like my previous set. This new set was made in China and my old one was made in Korea. They are very different.
3,Wallace Corsica Gold flatware,"This flatware is very stylish and good looking. However, it is very light in weight and feels cheap. It would be fine for occasional use but not for everyday use. It doesn't seem like it would hold up well over the long run."
3,Good but not great,The movie was fun but definitely not among my favorites. Story lines was predictable but cute with some good funny moments. Personally I almost did not make it past the first 5 minutes as I found some of the dialogue crude; after that though the movie was family friendly. The subtitles were good and ran at a nice readable pace.
3,100 Days with Mr. Arrogant,the movie was okay decent at the best very funny though good laughs the ending needs a little bit of work though
3,"Fun, if forgettable rom-com","Fast-paced and fun, if forgettable teenage romance. A high-school girl has a chance encounter with a rich college student, that leads to a minuscule scratch on the bumper of his fancy sports car. He demands 3 grand in compensation, and when she can't pay up, forces her to work as his ""slave"" for the next 100 days to pay off the debt. Eventually, the girl realizes she's being scammed - the damage is only about $20.00 worth - and turns the tables on him with a series of practical jokes. He retaliates by wangling a job as her tutor for the upcoming college entrance exams. Mutual antagonism turns to mutual attraction, and soon the pair are using their tutoring sessions as cover for sneaking out together...In Korean with English subtitles. Should be suitable for ages 12 up (some potty humor and mild swearing)."
1,Yuck..terrible...rip off,"One of the worst purchases I have ever made. The story wast stupid, but the production was worse. Not Korean....a want-a-be attempt. Pass it up."
5,Patti Smith Is Brilliant As Usual...,"""Gone Again"", released years after ""Dream of Life"", proves once again why Patti Smith is the undisputed rock 'n roll ginsberg. In my opinion, the lyrics here are her strongest, and most intelligent ever recorded. A must have, but people just getting into her would be best to get either ""Horses"" or ""Easter"" first."
2,Only the rubber stamps are worthwhile,"I bought this set about a year ago, and already the ink in the stamp pad is dry (I've kept it closed and hardly used it, so I attribute it to quality). The colored pencils are pretty much useless (they barely write), and the stickers are tiny and only one sheet (of 12, I think?). There aren't even enough stickers to give to every student in a typical classroom!The rubber stamps are high quality, but geared for younger children... which is why I'm confused about the ""frowny face,"" because most teachers of young children know that drawing frown faces on children's papers is not best practices (it's not constructive). If you buy this set, you need to ask yourself if four or five decent, cute stamps are worth your money - the rest of the set is pretty much useless, and you will have to buy a new inkpad soon."
2,Don't think you're Getting REAL TEACHER STAMPS!,"The price seemed too good to be true and it was. Is this a toy? I thought it was going to be a working set of stamps with a stamp pad. The stamp pad was too dry and I could not get any ink on the stamp. I added a couple Tablespoons of water to the stamp pad. I attempted to put a stamp on a student paper, but it merely made a small blotch of watery ink. It was impossible to see a smiley face on the paper.At this point, I will tell you this set is not worth buying if you are a teacher. The stamps worked a little better on a good ink pad I purchsed separately, but I still wouldn't waste my time trying to use them to create legible stamps on 50 student papers."
