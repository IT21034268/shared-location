4,Vital Vigor,"Three years ago I picked up a sampler EP called ""Japan For Sale"" and this single ""As You Like It"" has been a consistent part of my playlists since. The band FEED seems to be a four piece with a female lead. The lyrics of ""As you Like It"" are in English. The short song is sometimes pummeling and sometimes majestic. Love it. UPDATE: I found Feed's EP here on Amazon as both an MP3 download and CD:Make Every Stardust Shimmer. 25 minutes of epic Feed."
4,Nothing new.,"Ths album doesn't bring anything new to the history of the Cranberries. Plain pure quality songs, as usual, but nothing very original. Are they running out of ideas ? Are they gonna spend their career repeating the same old songs over and over with just a few changes in the lyrics ?"
4,Not for the timid.,"This is a hard, fast and dark cd. It is not for the timid, but put it on the last track, pump the volume, and scare the hell outta the neighbors!"
3,More like collectors items than playthings,"Boromir and Lurtz weren't what I expected when I received them. Boromir wasn't at all as good as I had assumed. His horn-blowing action didn't work, he couldn't stand up on his own, his sword was bent, and his shield didnt fit in his hand. He is well-designed and sculpted, nonetheless. Lurtz, the overall better figure, was very good except for his arrow-firing action, which didn't work. Lurtz is well-sculpted and can stand up fine on his own. But overall, I think these are more collectors items than children's playthings."
5,HERMAN'S OPINION,Very lifelike a soon to be legend in figure collecting...IN MY OPINION THIS ITEM IS ONE OF THE MORE FUN FIGURE SETS IN THE SERIES. A GREAT PART IN THE MOVIE TOO....
4,The Fun But Yet Beakable Toy,Lurtz teaches people a thing or two about shooting arrows. Boromir teaches that sword may be bigger then hand. It is great shooting arrows with Lurtz. I learned fast. Boromir's sword won't fit his hand. Boromir's sheath comes off but may be hard to put back on. It has good facial detail. Lurtz's arrows really work well but you have to shoot it for him. Boromir and Lurtz's buttons don't work well. But I found solutions to all these problems and it tuned out to be excedingly fun!
1,This was a very bad upset!!!!,"When I ordered this I thought it would be awesome. But when it came it was the worst. The action moves that each character has are terrible and neither one worked for me. Plus boromir's head turned the wrong way so he couldn't even blow his horn. And lurtz's arrows didn't shoot at alll, half of them didn't get out of the bow. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!! If I could have rated this a zero I would have."
5,I luv Boromir,"This toy is really cool. I haven't gotten it yet, but I have seen it alot, and Boromir is SO CUTE!!!!!!!! I luv Boromir... This toy looks like fun, and it's fully posable. And, if you have an annoying brother or sister, you can give them the orc if you don't want it. (That's what I did when I got the Merry, Pippin, and orc set... Heh heh heh...)Peace!~*~ Rose Gamgee ~*~"
1,Worst album I own.,"I remember Adrenalin OD speaking out against the Dead Milkmen for ""Trying to be funny."" Well if this album wasn't an attempt at being funny, I have no clue why it was produced. This is really sad, cause I like AOD.I didn't even give it a 2nd chance. There is no reason for anyone to own this. Looking through my collection, I'm confused that I even still have it."
4,Dark textures,"I like his style. The texture of bone and stone, of sky and earth are an interesting vision. This is the first book of his I found, the second was a Japanese/English work that was published after his death--that book includes one one or two reprints from this title, and is also a great addition to your collection."
2,Fantastic Art of Beksinski,"The information is very little and the drawings are so few, compared to all the Magnificent Work this talented artist drew and painted."
1,bad finish,I've used these less than 3 months and the finish on the bottom gold colr is already chipping off and there are spots on the top that cannot be removed with a copper & brass cleaner. This is a very inferior product!
5,Truly Inspiring,"For someone just getting into consulting, this book was inspiring and empowering. It makes you understand what worth you can bring to clients."
3,Good insights from an industry expert,"I enjoyed reading this new edition after the ""million dollar consulting"" edition. There are many useful tips for professionals such as me. Managing ""perceived value"" is an art and Alan Weiss is certainly a master. This is highly recommended reading for practitioners who need to perfect their skills and thrive in a brutal world"
5,Loved it!,Terrific book! Weiss hits the nail on the head about bringing value back to fee opportunities.
2,"If you have high payed friends, join them.","I would agree that Alan is a very good sales person, ""selling his books"". But I would have to say that the ideas or suggestions he has for ""value based fees"" ( VBF ) takes advantage of friendship on corporate business. It's hard to understand ""I think you are undercharging me, increase your proposal by a third"". Alan probably is very lucky and/or is surrounded by very nice business people with money to burn. I need those business people next to me!No doubt that he gives good advice but to apply VBF is a win win or loose loose situation. I'm going to try it first with clients I don't want...It was a good book to read and now I have a different perspective of business."
3,What happened to the band?,"This version is way to heavy in the mix. What happened to James Burton's incredible licks and Ronnie Tutt's slaps. Elvis sounds better on this remix but all the backup is faded into the orchestra becoming one wall of sound. If your into rock and roll get the original to hear what it really sounded like. Otherwise, get this one. I hope they don't screw around with the ""In person at the International Hotel"" release."
4,"great,but dissapionting mix!","this album is a definite 5 star album,but this new remix isnt as good as some people have stated. if you listen to the original album, the drums and guitar sound much stronger and much clearer! not that this mix is totally atrocious, but it sounds closer to an audience recorded bootleg, much more muffled and lower quality mastering than other recent releases such as aloha from hawaii, afternoon in the garden etc...the song runaway on this cd isnt even the one they issued on the original! still this release isnt totally horrible, but it could have been better."
4,Nice Introduction,"This is a very nice introduction to the great 17th century revolution in science. Singer concentrates on a single major issue; the emergence of modern dynamics and its ability to provide a universal explanation of motion on Earth and of the Solar system. Singer provides a nice precis of Aristotlean physics, the development of the Copernican system, and the contributions of Galileo and Kepler. He concludes with a chapter on Newton's triumphant development of modern physics. This is not a comprehensive history; there is little here about figures like Huygens or Descartes, but rather a thematic pursuit of a crucial issue. Presented with a minimum of math, this is an excellent exposition of how theory and experiment interacted to produce the basis of modern physics."
3,"A very good book, but...","This is a very good book, and it's about 3/4 Greek rather than Roman literature.Since it's mostly Greek literature, you might consider Michael Grant'sGreek Literature: An Anthology: Translations from Greek Prose and Poetry (Penguin Classics), which I actually prefer and which can be picked up used for a song."
1,Book was damaged,"The book I purchased was described to be ""like new,"" but had pages missing and had water damage on the cover."
5,A Great Collection,If you are looking for a small collection of Christmas poems I would highly recommend this one. A great assortment for all times surrounding the holiday and a good variety of authors. Poems range from religious themes to humor making this a book for almost every Christmas party you might attend.
4,A wonderful little treasure,What a great little book or poems. Not too heady - very enjoyable. Includes some carol lyrics. It harkens to a more genteel time. The language is flowery but not over the top. Bought a copy for a dear friend that lives 2500 miles away. Nice to know that we are sharing the same great works - just not together.
4,Everyman vs.Holyfool,"As editor ofThe Holyfool Book of Classic Christmas Verse, I am naturally prejudiced toward that volume; however, I recognize this Everyman book may be better for some usages: hence this comparison. This Everyman book is a beautiful compact hardcover; my volume is much larger, with a beautiful cover but not so much so. This Everyman volume is much more ""gift-ish"", though mine might make a better present for some more active readers. This Everyman volume contains some beautiful modern poems, while mine stops with the late Victorians. My own volume contains twice as many poems. Both are of a high literary quality. Mine attempts to be fairly comprehensive for the centuries it covers (14th-19th), whereas this Everyman volume is basically a sampling. Hopefully, you can purchase both, but I hope this comparison may prove useful if you must choose."
3,"works okay, but buy elsewhere","The product works okay, about as well as anything else that contains DEET will work. You'll want to bathe as soon as possible after applying and exposure, but it will keep mosquitoes, for the most part, away from you.However I realized I paid way too much for this through Amazon. I bought it because we had a camp out coming up and stores had already put away the sunblock/insect repellent sections. I paid $8 for this on Amazon, and the very next day saw it in Walmart's camping aisle for $4 - same size, same product. So check the camping section of your store before ordering here."
5,"Smells not so good, but it works","This worked great. At the same campground last year I got over 50 mosquito bites. I didn't get a single one this year (and it was just as swampy/wet this year). I bought this as well as a lemon eucalyptus spray. I would definitely get it again, since mosquito bites tend to swell pretty big on me."
1,Not full container,"I squeezed out all the product I could into a 2 ounce plastic bottle to be able to get through TSA screening. That it should do, BUT LESS than 2 ounces came out. See two photos on product page"
3,Too contrived.....music a bore,"I loved the original ""On Any Sunday"", and these other two installments were generally put together by Bruce Brown's Son Dana Brown. Dana generally edited some older footage not used in the original. One of my issues with this is the subtitling. Appears it was put together on Microsoft Front Page. The music on these are rather pityful and it gets generally annoying as the film progresses. I think Dana should probably begin doing some things on his own witout re-hashing bits of his fathers work."
1,Not for Macs,"My ISP demands Linksys routers, and the Linksys adviser reached by the special number on these pages assured me that it would work with Mac OS X. Not true. I bought it and now I'm stuck with it. Linksys own tech support which is based mostly in SE Asia gave me lots of bad and simply wrong advice, but always said Linksys does NOT support the MacOS. Linksys tech support generally has serious problems understanding andspeaking English. I both live and work in a very diverse environment, and thge Linksyspeople are just waybelow anything remotely acceptable. Pre-N sounds great, but I'll need to try some other brand: Netgear says tghey're compatible. Belkin might be - have looked enough. Bothb are cheaper than Linksys."
2,dipleased with item,when i purchased this item i thought it would be easy to set up and run but when i got it running the only page it would run was linksys's tech support page and would not load internet explorer pages.the software would tell me it could not get a connection to the internet. my other wireless card works well with the router . I was trying to get it to run with a dlink di624 router rev c with the most up to date firmware. my other current card is a dlinklink extreame card with 108mbs constant.
1,do not buy this product,I had much difficulty with the card causing my mouse to freeze. When I looked up help on this problem it said to update the driver or bios. The driver was update so I decided to update the bios. Updating the bios destroyed my laptop and now it is totally useless.
1,Linksys just doesn't work - support is abysmal,"This Linksys stuff simply doesn't work. And don't try getting technical support - it's a complete waste of time. If you can't Google the solution, just take the stuff back.The adapter install took out my TCPIP stack, even for my WIRED connection. It took me 3 full days to figure out that I needed to remove any sign of Linksys, Odyssey, and Funk Software from the registry, then remove and reinstall the TCPIP stack. Linksys support couldn't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days, a dozen emails, and 5 separate phone calls.Linksys support is just embarrassing. Don't be caught having to depend on it."
1,No Linux happiness here,"If you're running Linux on your machines, I would recommend staying away from Linksys cards. The company only supports Windows operating systemsfor thier hardware. The WRT54GX router is still nice for the range and signal strength boost, but without a matching SRX enabled adapter with Linux drivers, you may as well go with a vendor that supports Linux and avoid the hassle."
4,good extended range notebook adapter,"I bought this to help get a better signal into my laptop, which has built in wi-fi. The signal strength seems to be quite a bit higher, usually boosted by a bar or two, and I'm picking up other people's routers that weren't detectable before. The only problem I do have is with the linksys utility. It doesn't always launch correctly at startup (it stays grey, and you have to exit and relaunch), and even when it does, it jumps signals even when I have something listed by priority-whether I use the linksys utility or windows to configure. I ended up ditching the linksys utility and everything seems to be fine just running through windows alone. None of the other equipment has SRX, but I've noticed a boost in both signal strength and speed after using this. It might take a little while to work out the kinks, but if you need something to increase signal strength, this works a lot better than the range extenders on the market."
5,God is the Gospel,"Every Christian should read this book. It is so simple, yet so profound. In this day of misuse of scripture, with the blending of humanism in many teachings, this tells it like it is. Bottom line, why were we created, why did Jesus come to earth, why did he die and why am I here. These are all answered in this book, like the answer or not. Truth, truth, truth."
2,Good message - boring narrator,"I was really excited to listen to this book on CD. Unfortunately, the narrator almost put me to sleep! I don't think he did the message justice, and I think it's too bad."
2,Painfully repetitive - straining for something new,"John Piper has joked about the fact that he really only wrote one book, ""Desiring God"", and all his others are elaborations on that.It isn't a joke.This little book will make you feel like you're stuck in the movie ""Groundhog Day."" Every chapter is essentially saying the same thing.I also get the feeling that Piper is always looking for some new way of saying something that we've all heard before. Even the title, ""God is the gospel"", makes you stop and scratch your head. What? What does that mean? Well, it means God's goal is to have us realize the pursuit of Him is the ultimate joy in life. There, I just gave you the theme of this book.By the way, I'm reformed and think John Piper's work on Romans is probably the best I've ever heard. So, this isn't coming from a critic of the man or his ministry.This book is really repetitive and not something I would recommend."
1,this book is a bore,"Throughout the book, the main character, Will makes several attempts to write postcards to his pals back home, but on each futile attempt he crumples the cards and tosses them in the back seat, unsatisfied with his prose. I wish Eggers took a page from his own book.i loved the past book and am a huge fan of road stories, but this book didn't do anything for me. The characters' personalities and traits are too one dimensional and too heavy handed. As i read each page, i could see Eggers writing it. At no point was he able to suspend reality and make me believe in the story. I couldn't wait for it to end so I could move on.A sophmore effort, i hope Dave has something better up his sleeve for his next go around."
2,Only Made It Halfway,"I ordered this book because I had read AHWOSG and found that pretty good. I was surely dissapointed in this book. The story just drags on and on and on and never really goes anywhere. I made it about halfway through before I decided to stop wasting my time with a ""story"" I didn't really care about. It seems like it could be a really good book but falls so short of its potential."
3,Typical Self-Pitying Eggers,"I always enjoy the first half of his books and this book like AHWOSG starts quite well also. But I think he tries stretching out his books longer than they're meant to and towards the end he just ends up wallowing in self-pity for pages and pages and it's quite turn-offish. However, the first part is quite hilarious at times, so it may be worth it for you."
3,very nice paper,"How can I describe? The paper is nice and pleasant to touch(very, very nice paper) I couldn't stop touching it . . .I liked the pictures. . . especially of the circled bird. . . (what a perfect circle!) I think you should read this book. . . it's an experience, but not for everyone. . . some will be bored. . . there doesn't seem to be much of a point. . . much the same as life. . . try it and you may like it."
1,love dave eggers but hated this book,I love dave eggers and have read quite a few of his boks and have generally loved them but this book was just boring.
2,"Sorry, couldn't enjoy it","I have loved most of Dave Egger's books, but not this one. I don't give up easily, but half way through I couldn't take the pointless wandering of the characters and stopped. AHWOSG is an incredible book read that instead."
4,Very well worded and interesting,"Eggers is pretty unique. He has creativity, a way with words, humor, and a way of connecting with free-spirited readers. YSKOV can be abstract and strange at times, and you might not understand what you're reading, or might want to look further into what you're reading so you do understand it. I think it's hit or miss with readers. Give it an hour to see if you enjoy his style, and if not, move on."
5,Great Novel,"You Shall Know Our Velocity is a story about humanity more than it is a story about the world. Readers quickly get to know and relate to the characters, even before knowing their stories. Written with Egger's wonderfully fluid way of weaving a story and a person together. Incredibly enjoyable to read and travel through."
3,Read It If You Want to Laugh,"Otherwise, don't look for a masterpiece here. The people who compare this novel to _On the Road_ are just hoping a bildungsroman can come close to the white heat that Kerouac generated. Eggers doesn't. He does what he does best: hit you upside the head with hilarity at many points. But he doesn't do hardly any of what he did so miraculously in AHSWOG: he doesn't make you want to break down and cry after these squalls of hilarity.The narrator of Egger's classic memoir (AHSWOG) learns something from his madcap life, whereas the characters in _Velocity_ go through their adventures in a twenty-something fog. This is certainly where it compares to Kerouac, but the prose doesn't take off in any way that seriously twists your head like Kerouac's prose does. Again, it really comes down to the laughs here. Eggers truly has an idiosyncratic gift. In AHSWOG he uses this gift to unforgettable ends with his ability to wrest pathos from absurd situations. Here, not so much."
2,thanks for playing...,"The good news. I liked it better than AHWOSG.The bad news. I still don't care. I tried to give this book a fair shake after being so disappointed with 'Heartbreaking,' but it didn't redeem itself.The probelm that I have with stories and novels of this ilk is that of the elements of a story - plot, characterization, conflict, etc. - is that they all tend to be missing one of more of those elements. There has to be growth, or change, a moment of clarity, something, but I just couldn't find it. And it is fine for an author to be experimental, play fast and loose with the rules, e.g. Joyce, Beckett, Salinger, etc., but I can't see Eggers doing more than the literary equivalent of mugging for the camera."
3,"Worth a read, but not a classic...","""You Shall Know Our Velocity"" certainly tells an interesting story--two friends embark on a weeklong trip with a mission: travel the globe to give away money. Even though the plot is sometimes hard to follow, this novel is more accessible than Eggers' memoir, ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"" and is definitely worth a read."
3,Good...but,"Ok, so I will go with Eggers when he decides to write a book really fast and then publish it without editing, I'm there. So we have YSKOV. Ok, here we are, I'm reading...ok...and then I'm done and...nothing. NOTHING. Nothing happens in this book. It sits there circling itself like a plane waiting to land. It is awfully boring and any comparisons made to Kerouac are unjustly awarded and should be taken back quickly. Eggers suffers from, 'telling not showing' disease. He'd rather tell us about a death then feel it, and likewise, he'd rather not feel anything in these pages, just as he did in 'A Heartbreaking Work...' he never allows emotion to enter. You could call this post-mondernism at its finest, or you could call it sloppy writing. Literati have taken to the first one, I call it the second."
4,The blurbs on the jacket are way off base.,"Most of the reviewers of this book ignore the fact that the narrator explains that he will be dead soon as the first and last lines of the book. They then go on to praise how much they enjoyed the vivid descriptions and stream of consciousness writing technique, and state that it was life affirming. I agree that Eggers is a master of the method. I disagree that this book is a reaffirmation of life. It is instead an accurate description of the mental life of a self-absorbed, depressed, and ultimately suicidal late adolescent. The few glimmers of hope that the main character and narrator shows us that he might pull himself out of the abyss of suicidal depression are framed by the opening and closing lines of the book. This book is a good study of a suicide (all the hallmarks -giving away one's possessions is a classic red flag, are present), and therefore might have value as part of an educational curriculum, it is definitely not uplifting."
3,"Good, but not great","As others have said, there are parts of this book that are so original, they blow your mind. But, Eggers is so self-conscious in his writing, for every clever plot twist, the reader can almost envision Eggers, the wheels of his brain turning as he writes what he considers to be extremely clever passages. It gets old. As with HWOSG, the book is far better in the first half than in the second. It was a good read, but not the great read I had hoped."
3,Novel approach,"I think he could use a good editor. However, it is an original idea and an engrossing novel."
2,nice paper..crappy story,"This book is printed on lovely thick paper. That is about the highest compliment I can muster. I have only managed to read 160 pages, but I'm not sure I'll waste my time finishing. This book is nothing like AHWOSG. Do not buy this book if you are expecting a similar experience. Buy this book if you feel like owning a book printed in Iceland. Yahtzee!"
3,No Comparison,"This is an enjoyable book worth reading. But in no way should Eggers be compared to Jack Kerouac. Kerouac--through all seventeen of his novels, not just On The Road--defined the literature of his generation. He tested the boundaries of the modern novel and created a unique style that is only now being recognized for its brilliance. Dave Eggers, though a very good writer, is not yet close to Kerouac's achievement as a novelist. Perhaps someday."
2,"Dude, get an editor","I think Eggers is a really good (sometimes fantastic) writer, but I also think he needs some help paring things down and coming up with a book that doesn't grind you down. I've read both his books and scanned them at the end. I sometimes think he's playing games, seeing what he can get the critics to buy into. I can't believe the hype surrounding his books, the awestruck accolades. I doubt that half those critics ever made it through the books. I'll leave it at that, because I agree with most of the negative commentary on previous posts. Eggers is an excellent writer in spurts, but I think he's a bit (ok, a lot) arrogant and needs a good editor."
2,"Velocity not ""staggering genius""","Wow, after reading this book and reading some of the reviews I guess I needed to put in my two cents. Perhaps I'm too old to like it, as one reviewer would have it, being over 40. But I really loved AHWOSG back when it came out, so hoped to also like YSKOV...can't really say I did. I guess the term that comes to mind the most when I think of authors like Eggers, DF Wallace, and Sedaris is ""self-indugent"", also, a little really goes a long way. YSKOV starts out fantastically, and then flounders around so long I kept wondering why I was still reading, and began to think of other books on my shelf."
3,"Good start, sloppy finish","Good writing that starts out with an interesting premise but sadly dissolves towards the end into endless psychobabble. Promising but flawed, yet still worth a read"
2,Who ever said this guy was all that great??,"I have read both of Egger's books and I appreciate the freshness of his voice, but his 'cleverer-than-thou' rants are self-indulgent. It's interesting for awhile but can't be sustained for more than half of the book. A plot would be nice. His writing style reminds me of Douglas Coupland, author of Generation X. It's interesting, but will seem juvenille and self-absorbed with time."
3,"I think Eggers is great, but really, this book...","I've watched Dave Eggers rise to fame from our shared corner of the world, and I thought his first novel was brilliant, but something has happened to Eggers' writing in this novel. What was once quirky and refreshing about his writing seems more like artifice in this book. More often than not, Eggers' writing and plot twists are less profound than they are show-offy. While I was reading the book, I felt like Eggers was a two-year-old prancing around in front of the reading public saying, ""Look at me! Aren't I cute? Look at the adorable tricks I can do!""Admittedly, some of Eggers' literary tricks in this book are cute, and there are moments of touching and hilarious prose. (My favorite line: ""I opened my mouth but couldn't think of any way to answer. Someone was using my head to power a coffeemaker."")But in the end, the plot feels too forced, the writing too self-conscious. Dave Eggers is a good writer. This book doesn't, sadly, fully reflect that. _"
2,You shall know Dave Eggers,"Dave Eggers will win the Nobel Prize someday if they decide to award smugness. He is the master of being self-effacing, and at the very same time self-indulgent. He wants both sympathy and adulation. Dave Eggers should run for political office instead of write.Eggers engages in what I call ""prose babble"" which is very common among today's writers. Prose babble is a disease that has brought American Literature to its grave. He does not know how to write well, as much as talk well, and then write down how he talks. So essentially you get a first-person talk-a-thon novel rather than a written novel. Things like economy, vocabulary, and style are gone from these works. But you got a good friend talking to you, but you may not want to hear him go on and on and on."
2,suprisingly disappointed,"After reading Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius I was expecting this book to be a great entertainment, however, I was greatly disappointed. Even though most people gave it great reviews, I know I am not alone in thinking this book sucked. It was hard for me to finish this book because I was waiting for something interesting to happen. It has plenty of random things in the story that make it somewhat humorous but nothing of substance. I guess the point was to create a book that does not have to say anything (breaking conformity so to speak) but I didn't enjoy it here. So disappointed in fact, that I sold the book immediately after finishing it. I will say it is unique but definitely not interesting to read."
1,There are many books more worthy of consideration!,"I would have given 0 stars if possible. A real time-waster - I am loathe to set aside any book that I have paid for without completing it, but I could not justify spending any more time on this book once I struggled gamely through the first half, hoping that things would improve. Two young men of obviously impaired intelligence stumbling around the world without a clue - very sad. Tons of irrelevant detail mislead you into thinking there might be some depth to this meandering tale. Then one of these pathetic fools says, ""Wait a minute, everything you've read so far is a senseless lie, here's my take on the truth that is equally boring and idiotic."" At this point you've just got to say ""WHO CARES???!!!"" and go find a decent book to read. If you buy this book, don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,You Shall Know Mediocrity,"Let me begin by saying the title of my review is being generous. If anything, at least Eggers managed to include some funny and interesting observations. There was the occasional flourish of beautiful writing, like when he compares the waves against a person's hands to a soft kiss or the sadness associated with cleaning out someone's storage unit. But beyond these few moments, there really is nothing here. Is this anywhere near ""On the Road"" as LA Weekly says? Not even close. Does Eggers stand now with Joyce and Bellow as Entertainment Weekly states? Um...No. Did these people even read the book? Or maybe they did and that makes the positive reviews this got all the more scary. If this is where literature is heading, then I'm getting off the bus now. I'll spare you any details concerning the plot, because that is oddly interesting and you you may as well read the first 30-40 pages to learn about it. Afterwards, give the book away."
2,Well-written but self-indulgent and ultimately boring,"One thing really drove me crazy about this book.There are these little pictures inserted into the text from time to time. Which is fine. But at one point, the main character describes seeing three new cream-colored Broncos. And then there are these little pictures of three little trucks in the text.Problem? Well, first of all, the little pictures are actually Mercedes M-Class SUVs. And secondly, Ford stopped making Broncos well over a decade ago.Eggers, if you don't know anything about cars, don't write about them. The Car-Nerds are watching!"
1,You Shall Know Our Duplicity,"This is the worst, most meandering, sophomoric book I have ever picked up. Witness the hype machine printing money in full force as the pomo critics at the corporate conglomerates spam the world with ridiculous blurbs, all hoping to be allowed to publish in McSweeneys someday.I challenge anyone who has read this book to answer this--who are the characters? What are they up against? What moral dilemmas to they face? Who is the protagonsit, the antagonist? What is the catharsis? Why should we care about them? Is it a tragedy or comedy? What happens? Who changes? Where is the dramatic action? Who falls in love?Sadly, the novel is lacking these classical traits. Eggers lacks the talent to render them, and perhaps the incentive too, as a far better living can be made off of meandering, pandering hype, wasting shelf space and killing trees to fund the great egos of our generation."
2,All that eyestrain for naught...,"Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?) The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover. This was a guy I could get to like. Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars. If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated. Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs? Sure. Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book. I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already."
4,Much thought went into this chronicle of the grief process,"Now that I know a bit more about the life events that surrounded the writing of this book, I appreciate the art that went into demonstrating how the main character dealt with loss, both of people and of privacy. Part travelogue (interesting descriptions of airports, hotels, and local establishments), part elegy for narrator's friend Jack, this is a most unusual text. Loved his descriptions of the librarians in his head who persisted despite his attempts to ignore them!! The chapter by Hand, in which the writerly devices are supposedly exposed, is priceless."
4,Brilliant in parts,"I have a first edition that I bought at one of the McSweeney's vs. TMBG shows. The graphic design is beautiful. But I have to admit I didn't enjoy it as much as AHWOSG. Still, it's absolutely brilliant in parts, and I certainly laughed out loud many times while reading it."
1,painful,veryhard to beleive this endless story is by the same author who wrote his other engaging novels
2,Am I the Only One Who Thought This Book Was Crazy?,"My book club read this novel. I'll admit it's well written; I couldn't have made it to the end if it had not been. However, it was impossible to relate to the crazy experiences the protagonists in this book had. I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty!"
1,"No, No, No This simply won't do","Eggers, my friend, go to writing school. Your writing style is unpleasant and verbose. Not that writing programs can fix your immeasureable lack of talent, but they could at least show you what a good story looks like. And you should really try to read a book once a while that hasn't been written by one of your friends. Your atrocius writing leads me to believe that your reading habits extend only to the works of your fellow hipsters, in which case you should really try to remedy that with a thorough reading of the classics. Also, your titles are pretentious."
3,"More substance, less style please","A decent enough read, but in the end it is sad that a writer as talented as Eggers feels it necessary to resort to gimmicks and 'look at me' silliness to display his undeniable art. Right now, we are blessed by a number of young writers who possess talent but fortunately for us, don't feel the need to hit us over the head with their notions of restructuring an art form that has worked for ..oh...a few centuries now. Eggers could learn from the Hornbys and Franzens of the world and concentrate more on boring ideas like characterization and a little less on marketing an image. Thus, recommended but with reservations."
2,Good but far from classic.,"I liked this book but it could have used a once over by an editor, eliminating some typos & cutting about 200 pages. Some of it was cute & chuckle worthy. The description of The Orchid Thief in the film Adaptation comes to mind (despite not having read that to be able to compare): sprawling New Yorker s**t."
3,Inconsistency,"Dave Eggers is definitely a talented guy, and his ideas, particularly the one for this novel, are fantastic. But I think Dave Eggers said this fairly well of his Heartbreaking Work... that after a certain point the book gets inconsistent. That's how this book felt... starting really strong with a strong voice and purpose. But as the book continues on it begins to lose its grasp on communicating with the reader, with particular confusion generated by the interior dialogues. Perhaps Eggers was using it as a device to convey the main character's state of mind, but it hurts his ultimate purpose. I really love some of the metafictional aspects of the novel and thought they were rather clever. I wish Eggers would stick to writing short stories, since he seems to have the equivalent of writer's ADD and his words lose potency the more of them he writes."
2,uggh,"I guess as a writer it's a blessing and a curse to be your own publisher AND editor.You get to publish your book as you see fit, but you don't get the objective criticism of a hard boiled editor who tells you what must be cut. The result here is an egocentric mangled mush of smarmy lines.Amazon reviewer ""The Forth World"" sums up the story pretty well, but I gave the book the two stars because, like a few other reviewers here, I found the writing style trite and annoying.The catch to my review is that I only got 20 or pages into the book, and I already knew everything about the story that ""The Fourth World"" said.Yes, it's THAT predictable. I then scanned through the rest of the book, and decided I couldn't take 300 more pages of glib, self indulgent turns like that ""...using my brain as a coffeemaker"" line. In fact, is was that line that was the kiss of death for me."
3,NOT A BOOK BY CHOMSKY...just so you know,"It's actually about the debate between other linguists regarding his take on deep structure and ""rival"" linguistic theories in general. if you're into his research and lectures (or advanced language study in general) this has some good insights. Just don't expect an actual Chomsky book.And to the 8 oh-so-""intellectual"" people that were deeply wounded enough to lash out in hissy rage at this review as ""not helpful"" (or the one that voted 8 times and has no life), get over yourselves(/self); this review is to keep people anyone looking for additions to their Chomsky linguistics collection from accidentally buying what is a tangential contribution at best.Saving people money is pretty helpful, kids."
4,So good.,"Kim Addonizio, What Is This Thing Called Love (Norton, 2004)I've had a bad run of poetry recently, so it was refreshing to pick up Kim Addonizio's What Is This Thing Called Love and find the best book of poetry I've picked up in the past month. I've been a fan of Addonizio's ever since I first discovered the west coast poets twenty-odd years ago; I hadn't read her in a while, though, and was somewhat concerned the bloom might have come off the lily. How happy I was to be wrong.""What a relief to discoverthat the doctor in my dreamdid not exist, that his voice on the phoneand even the phone itselfwere only figments, neural parcelsshipped from my brain stemto my thalamus....""(""And Then I Woke Up"")Lean, tough writing, alternately sexy and horrifying, but of consistently high quality. It's been a lot of years since I first encountered her in Three West Coast Women. If anything, she's only gotten better in the years since. ****"
3,another fine book!,"I love this book, not as much as Tell Me, which freaking ROCKED, but still...no one now writes as sassy and real as Addonizio does. eagerly waiting ANOTHER!"
4,old-time model,This model comes in cast metal pieces and must be assembled and painted. It feels more creative and personal than just buying a ready made figure
2,"This Is Not the Version from ""The Silence of the Lambs""!","Fellow music Lover trying to save someone elses dime. I searched to find that cool song, ""Alone"", from ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" and I thought that I found the correct version. I Was Wrong, this is NOT The Version from the movie. At this point I don't know where to get it because an earlier review stated that the Soundtrack didn't have the correct version either.As a stand alone CD, I didn't like it.I do like groups like The Cure especially ""Mixed Up"" album.If someone finds the Correct version, leave a review so that other Lovers of ""that cool song"" can buy it for themselves.cheers-JH Atlanta, GA."
2,No new information you wouldn't already have.,"While not poorly written you will find yourself skipping pages in this book. Gary spends a great deal of time telling you about the characters habits, backpacking, flower pots, pets and such in much more detail than he does about the actual company and magazine.OK, but a VERY quick read."
2,Disappointing,It takes a while to get into this and only once did I not want to put it down. It could have been written in a more engaging manner.
3,This book really makes you stop & think,"T.C.Boyle wants to warn us about the damage we are doing to our planet. He tells the story of a former ""eco-terrorist"" & goes back & forth between the 80's/90's and the year 2025. The characters are not particularly likeable. There's an amusing Michael Jackson-like character who appears occasionally. It was hard, at times, to empathize or connect with the passion of the main character & his daughter. But, the story was compelling enough to keep turning the page. I wanted to hear T.C.Boyle's vision of the consequences of our abuse of the planet. That's the compelling piece and, if he's even remotely correct, it's frightening. The book is too complex and pedantic at times to be interesting to a teenager but it would be helpful to have younger people read the book now that environmental issues often take a backseat to other news items. We should all appreciate the author's warning & take a look at our own behaviors."
4,"dystopia, usa.","the shifting chronology, from end-of-century environmentalism and monkeywrenching do-goodism, to a bleak future, a quarter of century later where the widening ozone hole and el nino have wreaked their vengeance on the earth and its inhabitants, has the effect of bracketing a spate of touchy eco-subjects. tc boyle is too gifted as a novelist and satirist to fall prey to didactic posturing. this book is a heartfelt homage--told from the perpective of the elderly narrator whose job is taking care of a menagerie of endangered species for a mega rock star-- to an abused earth, and the people self-chosen to protect its natural treasures. the spirit of edward abbey, david brower and julia butterfly hill reside at the epicenter of this book that also questions the so called altruistic intentions of these anti-logging green activists."
2,"Great Author, Weird Tale","I really wanted to like this book but I just couldn't get into it and never finished it. That is very rare for me. The main issue I had with the story before abandoning it at 3/4 of the way through is I kept wondering what is the point. Where is this going.The author is definitely a top notch word smith, hence I did try really hard to finish the book but the characters while intriguing lacked a certain depth to me and the plot was plodding at best."
5,Does the earth need a friend,"I am a huge fan of TC Boyle's novels and A Friend of the Earth does not disappoint. I laughed out loud as I read, which is one of the draws for me to his work, it is so darn hilarious.It is also thought provoking but not the way I thought it would be...I found irony in the age old man vs nature struggle and discovered that I realize nature ALWAYS wins. We are doomed in many ways but what we do have is something nature can not take away...love.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,José Bové would like it,"Funny to see these reviews of A Friend of the Earth... We've had had a great time discussing it on the author's site ..,. OK, we're all true seasoned fans and compulsive readers of Tom. Hence, our view is maybe rather biaised. Nonetheless, it's the best book (fiction) you can read on global warming and what it could imply for human relationships since James G. Ballard's books... José Bové would surely love (and hate) to read ""Un Ami de la terre""..."
3,More great prose from T.C. Boyle,"Having read all of T.C. Boyle's previous novels, I knew when I picked up A Friend of the Earth that I would be treated to this author's elegant and poetic writing style. I was not disappointed. This man can truly turn a phrase: a girl has ""hair the color of midnight in a cave."" Wildflowers are ""on fire in the fields."" And that's what kept me going until the end of the novel. I didn't find the plot particularly riveting andI wasn't drawn to any of the characters. But the pure poetry of T.C. Boyle's prose carried me along as if I were floating down a clear mountain stream. If you're concerned about global-warming, the rape of the forests by the timber industry, and the struggle to save the Earth from the clutches of humanity--a species that insists on reproducing and using up every last vestige of the Earth's resources, then read this book. If not, you may enjoy it anyway, if only for the beautiful writing contained herein."
1,No Friend of Mine (or Yours),"As a long time fan of Mr. Boyle's, I am sorry to say that I found this book dreadful - probably should never have been published. There is not a single character in here worth caring about and the overall tone is meanspirited and humourless. An uninspired mistake from a very gifted writer. The one star is for the jacket by Marty Blake."
1,Very Poor,"This is by far the worst book by Mr Boyle I have read. Not his best work, poor story, slow and boring."
2,"Interesting story, but sloppy writing","I've never read anything by TC Boyle before this book, so I can't compare this book with his previous works. However, I don't think you have to be familiar with his work to know that his writing seemed sloppy and rushed in ""A Friend of the Earth."" Boyle's writing style is flowery and verbose, and I think he should spend more of that energy on developing more of the characters and tidying up his storylines. None of these characters seemed worth caring about because they are so flat. I barely cared about the protagonist. I will say that I enjoyed reading about what Southern CA is like in the year 2025, and all of the descriptions of climate changes, erosion, and extinct animals. His blaring cynicism is humorous, but it's not enough to make me recommend this book as a good read."
2,Thoroughly depressing,"Very rarely when reading a book I have had this exact feeling: this might be a fine novel with lots of merits, full of good intentions, crafty storytelling, effortless juggling of time frames - but it's not for me at all.I can't remember reading a similarly depressing book in the last few years. Virtual everything is bad at the beginning and goes downhill from there. There are times you want to grab the protagonist by the collar and shake some sense into him. All that is probably very intentional. Did I enjoy it ? Not one bit.There are definitely things to recommend about this book. I've read some other novels by Boyle and would wholeheartedly recommend Riven Rock and especially Water Music, but I didn't like this one at all."
4,Hometown Heros,"This band is from my hometown and I remember seeing them at Battle of the Bands in 8th grade and they've really matured in sound since then. ""The Looking Glass"" is an excellent CD, a mix of rock, hardcore and techno. It's kept me awake through many a term paper! Tyler's guitar is an extension of his body, Kurt plays drums like a mofo, Rob is an excellent bassist, John's raspy singing voice is very sexy. The best part about their upcoming fame is I'm going to be able to say I used to get drunk with the lead guitarist of Roots of Rebellion. If you ever get a chance to see them live, I reccomend it. Great to dance to! (...)"
4,Press play and sit back and listen.,"This album has a lot of variety on it. The bands sound is unique and different from everything else you hear on the radio. I just push play and go from track to track, I wouldn't skip any of these songs."
5,It teaches hundreds of idioms in their everyday contexts.,"This is the most sophisticated idiom text I've seen in my 7 years teaching ESL. Ideal for the intermediate to advanced student, It includes the most-used phrasal verbs as well as expressions. The excercises are well designed matching, cloze, and conversation/role plays. What a pity if it's not re-published soon!"
5,Super value,The book is much newer than I expected. It is a surprise to get a high value book in such a low price. :D
4,Great portable kitchen,"After reading many of the reviews for this product, I was expecting the worst when my 2 1/2 yr old daughter received this item for Xmas from a relative. To my surprise, she really liked it and still plays w/it on occasion. My son who is 10 months old is the one who really enjoys it, since it's tiny and perfect for a crawler. My daughter doesn't play w/it much anymore, but my son still plays w/it everyday. I would recommend this product for older infants, maybe 9 months to 18 months old. If you want a great pretend kitchen, this is definitely not what you want. But it's great if you don't have a lot of space for a huge kitchen w/out having to dish out hundreds of dollars for something kids tire of anyway."
2,not what I expected,"This is a great, durable kitchen for an infant. It is very small in size, but does a lot of talking. I needed something they could stand up and play with. This is not recommended for children who want interactive play in a kitchen."
3,"A good buy for the money, but not overall impressed","My 3-yr old son enjoys this toy, but quickly gets bored after a few minutes. He received the talking BBQ grill as a gift and liked it, so thought he would enjoy this one as well. My rating is based on the fact that I would like to have seen more lights, especially on the cooktop, and the blender has yet to say ""Who wants a milkshake?"" like it is supposed to. However, since I got it on sale, I would said it was a good value for the money I spent."
3,I would not buy this again,We bought this toy for our year old twin girls and our 2 1/2 year old girl. our girls love to play in their kitchen area so we added this to the collection. I'm very disappointed that the feet don't stay on the back so it tips over very easy. The cookies are too small for any child. the girls do like the microwave but the door comes off all the time. the batteries have now died after only 3 months of not much use and we will be moving it to the rummage sale pile instead of replacing the batteries due to our disappointment in the product.
2,Very Small!,"i was all set to buy my 2 year old this kitchen. i loved how it looked on amazon. however, i didn't take note of the size, and got a real shock when i went to the store! its tiny! i thought my daughte would be able to stand and play with it, but instead she would have to kneel. and even then, the kitchen would come up to her torso. if you're looking to buy a play kitchen your child can play 'in', this is not the one for you. however, it is still a cute toy."
1,"Boring for a 3 yr old, Cookies a chocking hazard too","Our daughter got this toy as a gift for christmas. It's okay. She only plays with it for a little and really only likes the button on the microwave. But at age 3 (the minimum age for this toy!!), she is much better off with a larger kitchen so she doesn't have to squat down. Her imagination is also beyond this toy. I kinda find the toy annoying bc it goes on and on before stopping finally. The stickers already fell off and the cookies are small enough to entirely fit in the child's mouth but too large to easily get out by a 3 yr old!! She can't swallow them but it was gagging her repeatedly until I was able to get it out of her mouth. Needless to say, we don't use the cookies. But the others seem fine. All in all, I would recommend something else for a younger child like the Discovery Sounds Kitchen by Fisher Price, or something larger scale for an older child. Sorry."
3,Good for Younger Toddler,My husband picked this up for our sons 2nd b-day and he was thrilled at first. He soon broke off the mixer and as another person stated the mixed never said the things the advertised kitchen mixer says. My son still occasionally plays with this but not for long. It is a nice deal for the $$. But its better for under 2yrs old.
4,I wish I was a kid again.,"The day I got this toy, I just had to push the buttons. It is so cute! Any little girl (or boy) would love to have this little kitchen. I ordered it for my church's giving tree (I know it's summer but you know what they say about the early bird...)and I hope I'll be able to give it up."
3,Fun at times,"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She doesn't really play with it much. She will walk by and push something, laugh, and then move on to another toy. It is kind of cute though. Might be better for older kids."
2,"Fun, but comes apart too easily","My 5, 4, and 2 year old love this toy, but it breaks and falls apart too easily. The oven front and door to the microwave come off within 10 minutes of replacing them. Although my children love this toy, I wouldn't reccommend wasting money on such a defective product."
1,What a joke,"This was the most disappointing purchase I have ever made. This author thinks he is Don Juan for sure. I don't know what planet he was on when he wrote the book, but it's most certainly not in our solar system. This was not a book of advice but only a list of theories,opinionsamd bad one-liners. If you are trying to sincerely learn new dating strategies, skip this one. If you are looking for a comedy of errors, this is the perfect book for you."
5,Dating secrets improves dating skills!!,"As you suggested, I read first the dating secrets for women and then I read the dating secrets for men. Good suggestion! Now, guy don't puzzle me as much as they used to. Your book of dating ""secrets"" has certainly improved my dating ""skills."" Thanks a lot!!"
1,Very Misleading,"I ordered this book thinking it was indeed the complete works of Nietzsche. It is not. It's ""An attempt at self-criticism, Foreword to Richard Wagner, The Birth of Tragedy"". Yep. No complete works. I'm going to file a complaint now. Don't get this book."
2,"The complete works of Friedrich Nietzsche, is a misleading title.","I enjoyed having this philosopher back in my life after a loss of my personal library. The title is misleading, however, this book is no where near the complete works. Amazon could do a much better job on product descriptions."
1,danger will robinson!,"If you're thinking of getting a Kleenex Girl Wonder album, GO BUY PONYOAK INSTEAD! While Ponyoak is an awesome album, 'Smith' may be the most self indulgent waste of time to be recorded in recent memory. it's basically a solid EP's worth of material interspersed with a might-be-amusing-if-you're-still-in-junior-high story about a boy and his computer. or something. i only made it halfway through the first disc before i started skipping the ""story"" to listen to the songs, and even that was more effort than it was worth. stay away!"
4,Buffalo Tech Wireless DSL G Router High Gain Antenna WHR-HP-G54,"Pretty simple set up.I did fail to see that this is not a DSL modem AND DSL router in one...so I had to go buy a seperate dsl modem.We use Bell south in South Carolina, who told us they don't support the modem or the router I have now, but they worked fine.I do see a stronger signal than before, but that is only in comparison to a ATT 2 wire, so it's not saying much.I think if i tweak it, I can probably get an even stronger signal with greater distance, but haven't bother yet.I could probably give 5 stars on all ratings, but just don't do that as a rule in life....."
5,Upgraded with DD-WRT,"I have purchased several of these for myself and for a non-profit with which I do some volunteer work. These routers have a great range and the feature set is really great when you couple them with DD-WRT. They make great routers as well as wireless access points. Using multiple SSIDs is also easy to do with the DD-WRT system loaded on them. I haven't used the stock firmware, so I can't say anything about it, but I really like these routers."
2,Could not set this up,"First of all, the primary problem may have been that there was NO ""Quick start"" guide included. Just two CDs. There was no way of knowing which CD to use first, or in which device (my hard wired desktop, or the wireless laptop) because there were NO INSTRUCTIONS!Oh, sure, there was a 90+ page manual ON THE CD which you cannot access without opening the package and using the CD!I am not an idiot. I struggled for 3.5 hours with this router, and finally gave up.I was not able to get further and using my wired internet with the router on.My laptop SAW the router, but could only connect ""local access"" for some reason.A complete waste of time and energy. It's probably a perfectly good router, but the lack of instructions made it useless to me."
3,Poor AOSS,"The Router is a good product that supports 125Mhz mode with appropriate adapters. This high speed mode works well, even with moderate signal of about 60%. Unfortunately, when I put my A31p Thinkpad in standby mode(running AOSS), then restore power, I lose wireless connectivity. This doesn't happen when AOSS is off. AOSS security was a strong factor in my decision to purchase this unit, so it is only semi-satisfactory."
4,Buffalo G54 Rocks,"Extremely easy set up. Excellent documentation. I was expecting more power output so bought the WLE HG NDR 6.5 db hi-gain antenna. Was very disappointed that this antenna does not work with the G54. The adaptor doesn't fit on the router as the collar is too large. So returned the Buffalo antenna and bought a D-Link which mated perfectly. Go figure. Pay the extra $ and buy the good stuff that Buffalo makes. I also own the PCI card and the PC card from Buffalo. All installed and working perfectly without incedent, except for the antenna issue. I used the Buffalo to replace Belkin and Netgear equipment."
1,Boat Anchor,"This router worked great for 2 months. Setup was easy and the range was excellent. I started having to reset it 4 times a week after 3 months. Now it needs to be reset multiple times per day. I consider this router a complete waste of money. Changing channels is useless and disabling the AOSS as recommended by customer support is just as useless. It died just after I could not return it to Amazon as defective. Now I'm forced to get a different router and will never buy another Buffalo product. If you're looking for a router that works for 2 months, this is the one for you."
2,Range problem?,"I bought this product to work with a Logitech squeezebox. The squeezebox is connected to my stereo amplifier and plays .mp3 music files sent to it wirelessly by the Buffalo access point. The music frequently skips or stops completely. Rebuffering occurs frequently as the squeezebox is gathering data from the access point. During this period, the music will stop. The distance from access point to squeezebox is about 35 feet. This shouldn't be a range problem for a wireless device. Buffalo Techs have not solved the problem ."
3,Keep getting a self assigned IP,This router is pretty good for the money. Not particularly difficult to set up. But our computers keep getting self assigned IP address. We've never had this problem on any other router.
3,"Between ""Ok"" to ""Huh""","If you're with Clearwire, you'll find the first few days kind of mind numbing. It took a lot of trial and error with my providor to change my settings, but we eventually got it. (Had to unclick my TCP/IPv6 and leave it on 4TCP/IPv4 because I run Vista on Clearwire Wireless Internet)As for this router, the instructions were confusing. It was a little unclear on identifying your setup procedures, which disks to use first, then proceeding on which set of steps to follow. It took a little trial and error but I eventually figured it out. This is not my first time to set-up a wireless router.However, once you iron out all the confusion, this router is actually not too bad."
4,Big Improvement,"I was using a wireless modem supplied by telephone DSL provider and the signal was too low for one of my three computers. This Buffalo unit did the trick, with way more signal power. Unit did not have instructions for a MAC, but initially didn't need it to make it work. Plug and Play. But, to make it really work correctly I had to speak twice with their tel. Support network - which was reasonably efficient.Price and Performance. Hard to Beat."
2,Disappointing performance,"I bought this Buffalo router to replace an old Linksys WRT54G, after reading reviews both on Amazon and other computing sites. Setup wasn't as clear as with the Linksys product, but was acceptable. The performance was very disappointing, however. I didn't get nearly as good a range, and my notebook frequently lost the signal from the Buffalo router, forcing me to connect again and again, often several times within a half hour period. My notebook is only one room away from the router. I've gone back to the old Linksys for now. This product may work for some, but not for me."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype!,"Noticed very little if any additional range and connection. Features are over exaggerated. If you need more range, go with a multi-antenna router."
2,Tis not just good enuf,"The security that Buffalo Technology wireless-G high power router and access point with high gain antenna WHR-HP-G54 offers was a hot topic of discussion among my friends. Decided to opt for it because it advertised of the AOSS one-touch security setup.The Intrusion Detector is a good feature because it alerts me about the attacks on my network. The built in SPI-firewall also protects my network.But there are many cons to this device. The installation was not as easy as many suggested it would be. I use a Windows Vista and the installation took me a couple of hours.I have to reset every now and then to get it to work. Looks like it's on the verge of dying. And I have been having this only for the past 6 months. When put to use, the range is not very satisfactory too. It works well only with systems close by. The purpose of owning a wireless is defeated! The customer service is awful."
2,"""MIMO Performance"" is a joke.","All of the marketing hype in the world can't counter the fact that this router has weak signal strength. I bought this router when my Zyxel X-550 died, and I've gone from 80% signal strength down to 20%.If your house is remotely large, or the router isn't near your computers, this router won't do the trick.On the plus side, for computers near the router it seems to work reasonably well."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I tried setting this up for a cumulative of about 8 hours. Finally, I just gave up, and decided to return it. I don't know what was going on but the automatic set-up process did not work for my system (Windows Vista) or maybe it was because of how I received connection... I went and bought a Linksys router the week after, and got it up and running in 5 minutes. Waste of time."
5,Best Router I Have Ever Owned,"And I've tried every brand out there, and for some brands I've bought several models. They all gave me the same problem over the years: they would lose their connection many times during a day and had to be unplugged and restarted. None of them were ever easy to set up either. Netgear, Linksys, D-Link, Belkin, all the same results. But this Buffalo router has finally got it right! This will stay connected for long periods (we're talking 2-3 weeks) without any interruptions whatsoever. This also can accept traditional ethernet cables for your wired equipment. I've never been happier with a wireless router and for the first time I have one I can recommend without hesitation. Five stars! Tech Notes: I use PC laptops running Windows Vista."
5,WORKS GREAT,"I USE TO HAVE A LINKSYS ROUTER THAT I HAD TO CONSTANTLY UNPLUG TO RESET ALMOST EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF LOSE CONNECTION,ESPECIALLY WHEN MY PS3 WAS DOWNLOADING UPDATES. WITH THIS ROUTER I HAD IT ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND NEVER HAD TO RESET IT YET. LOVE IT"
2,Looks Great - Can't Get it to Connect,"Received my new Buffalo router today -- tried at least 7-8 times to get it up and running with our 2 new HP Pavilion notebooks -- no deal. I called '24/7' customer service/tech support and after being on hold for at least 25 mins and listening to elevator music, I gave up. Will try again tomorrow. Seems as if it would recognize wireless connections/modem/DSL/cable instantly, but it doesn't. I plugged my old Netgear router back in, reset it, and voila! We were back up and wireless in under a minute. Hopefully I will get through to someone at Buffalo Technologies tomorrow -- more later."
5,Rock Solid Router,Well I bought this as a replacement for a Linksys wrt54gs that would drop connection sevreal times a month. I read the reviews on the Buffalo and bought it. I did the DD-WRT firmware upgrade before I set it up on the network. I was a little nervous about the flash since you have to TFTP to flash it and I had never done that. Well I had no problems. I did the flash plugged it in and it has worked rock solid with better signal strenght than the Linksys ever since. I highly recomend the router.
4,very good,It works so much like expected or even more. It is very easy to set up and they walk you through every step. The security is pretty good. I really like it.
3,"Great, after you get it working","I'm not exactly a wiz when it comes to installing new hardware, but after a long battle with this router, I finally got it to work! Now, it performs well."
3,Possible Vista problem,"It took several attempts to get this router working correctly with a Buffalo wireless card. It may be Vista related, however. The products are now working adequately."
1,"Doesn't work out of box and ""24/7 support"" has had me on hold for 45 minutes","I got this router because it was supposed to be reliable and easy to install, and because Buffalo supposedly has 24/7 phone support.Out of the box, it won't let me proceed beyond the initial steps because it keeps telling me there is a connection error -- but there isn't (I know how to connect a router, I've checked the connections ten times, I've followed Buffalo's diagram exactly, and the same connections and cables work just fine on the Lynksys I'm trying to replace).No problem, I thought, I'll just call the Buffalo 24/7 support line. That was 48 minutes ago.Obviously, some people have been successful with this router, but for me it's an immediate return and 2 hours of time wasted."
2,"Maybe effective for others, but not for me","While the taste was pleasant enough, in my experience, it provided precious little heartburn relief, nor did it ""keep acid down for hours"". I won't be buying either the tablet or the liquid again.Again: pleasant taste, ineffective relief."
5,"good, but grizzlies are a serious threat","I saw this book at Tower and picked it up because of the cover and I have to admit that these stories really get under your skin. Especially the story about the fire ants. You don't want to mess with fire ants! The chapter on the elevator falling was also pretty cool. It'll make me think twice next time before I mess with an elevator. The really nice thing is that these stories are short, so if you get tired of one you can just go on to the next one. But they are all really good except for the one on the Grizzly. That hit a little too close to home for me because of a childhood accident with my youth group. But if you have never been exposed to a Grizzly the way I was then you might not object to it the way i did. Besides, the other 39 stories were all pretty good and definitely get under your skin in a good way."
3,So-so,"I thought the concept for the book a little more exciting than the book itself. The stories seemed too short, and a few end abruptly without much explanation as to what happened next. It seems only obvious that extreme encounters should have extreme details, but that's not the case here. Overall, I think 5th through 8th graders would appreciate this book most."
4,Delores O'Rordian Rules!,"Personally I prefer the ""softer"" side of the Cranberries and Ms. O'Rordian. Her soft, breathy, ballad style songs, tinged with her profound Irish accent, and occasional ""Irish yodel"", just flat out put me away! Granted, I also like the upbeat solid, ""alternative rock"" style songs that the band has developed as well. This particular CD, (some of the lyrics not withstanding), is a good example of what the Cranberries can truely be. Clean , clear, rock or smooth, silky ballads that make you just relax in the sound of Delores O'Rordian's lush , captivating vocals. This toning down of the band as a whole is fine with me. Too much gutteral angst is not all that pleasant on the ear."
2,Alas...,"I found this album to be, as many have said, a disappointment. I was once a huge fan of this band, but the last two albums they've released I just cannot take seriously. The lyrics are perhaps the worst part about this album I suppose, although artistically, it just seems weak all around."
1,"ahh pure poop, disapointed in New Mexico but still fans","""Freaks me Out"" Please !!! Barney and Friends can do better. Advice: Get Shane MacGowan to give you some pointers on song writing."
3,Thier worst effort so far,"I'm a big Cranberries fan, but was greatly disappointed by this CD. There are few memorable songs and the lyrics are a bit ""distracting"", to be kind. A true fan will still want to have this, but I would recommend any of their previous albums over this one."
4,"fresh, up-beat, and just down right fun","Although I expected a mix of the first, second, and third records. This one had my expectations down, but all in all, I enjoyed the up-beatness about it. Songs like ""You and Me,"" "" Saving Grace,"" & ""Dying in the Sun"" are personal favs of mine, those songs make me think of the first and second record. If you like the third record, well this one has nothing to do with it. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad the Cranberries are making music a little bit more peppie, even though I love ""To The Failthful Departed"" this one has got me happier. But I will always remember the tunes that got them started!!!"
4,At last the Cranberries are back!,We've all waited a long time for a new album from The Cranberries. This one isn't too disappointing. If your a true CranFan like myself you'll look past some of the childish lyrics and just be glad to hear Dolores' voice again.
3,Comes apart very easily - not too impressed,"My son loves all things Toy Story. He enjoys playing with the toy, however it comes apart very easily. The parts unsnap with average play. No, they are not broken, but we frequently pause our game to put it back together. Also, like other reviewers my son is disappointed that Zurg is not part of the command center esp. since some of the automated commands mention Zurg. And, esp. since we can not purchase Zurg locally. (...)"
2,Dissappointment,"Like many of the reveiwers mentioned, there is no Zurg included in this set. My son bought this toy with some of his birthday money from Toys R Us. Before we even left the store I read on the box that Zurg is not included, so we searched the entire store for a small zurg to go with the center. None was found, since then we have went to Kmart and Target, no Zurg to be found. IF you buy this toy be aware that you may not ever find your villian."
2,Buzz's Intergalactic Headquarters,"No very impressed...especially for 29.95. Its small and comes with a couple small toys, For the price I was dissapointed."
5,Absorbing,"I'm not quite finished, but I find myself thinking about the characters when I'm doing other things. The use of language is brilliant, and the story absorbing."
5,Must Read,This is a must read for anyone with children. A wonderful resource for understanding your child of any age. Fun to map your whole family and understand how you can work better together. A great tool if your child is struggling with their educational experience.
2,"Old favorite but book condition not ""good""","This book was a gift for my fiance who has picked up photography again as a hobby. My family had it when I was young so I knew that it was a good book for nature photography enthusiasts. Now, almost 50 years after it was printed, it is understandably dated as far as the printing quality goes, however, even at that vintage I would have not interpreted a book that shows damage and a tear on the cover, to be rated as ""good"", Maybe I'm just too picky?"
3,Midnighters Book 1,"It was a good read, however, this book is more like an introduction to the series and doesn't stand alone well."
3,Made me wonder,"I picked this book up some months to years ago, not quite sure, drawn by the cover.Though done in Young Adult fashion this book can really be enjoyed by any age.The author makes you wonder about the past, not only the characters past but the past of the setting, the unusual town of Bixby.With heavy mathmatical ties and assumptions of tradition and folk-lore this book is not a childish read and worth picking up."
2,Not for me!,"After reading other reviews I found that it must just be me that doesn't like this book, because all others seem to thoroughly enjoy it. As for me, not so much. I thought that it was a little to ""imaginary"", at least for me. I am more into realistic fiction. Although I didn't like it I do think that it would be a good book for a younger audience."
2,good.... wait,"Came acrossthis series, and it sounded interesting. Read the sample first and I liked it, and got the book. The first, maybe 3 chapters, good. Then I found myself skipping pages to skip all the boring parts! And there were tons! I read books with a good attitude so ill have a chance at really liking them, but it was impossible to like this book. It seemed so slow, Id rather read fast paced books. If u liked all the Percy Jackson books, the maze runner trilogy, and the hunger games... it doesn't mean you will like this series."
4,Great Book,I was a little unsure what I would think of this book after hearing what it was about. But I decided to go ahead and read it anyway. It was great. I loved the unique idea presented and the story was great.
3,Ok,"I saw so many great reviews for this book, I just had to pick it up and give it a go. Sadly, it didn't go as great for me. It was to science and sci-fi. I didn't really enjoy it and it just wasn't my kind of book. So I left it as is. Let this be the ending and not continue on. She is a part of the secret hour at midnight, she falls for a boy who seems to equally like her, and even develops unexpected friendships. THE END.I am sure people who enjoy this genre enjoyed this book and for those who are looking for a sciencey feel should pick this up also. :)"
4,great,Love the book and author but not as much as j.k. RowlingHad stickers on it and had wear to it but not badRecommend to all
4,Reading At Midnight,I liked this series immensly. It will keep you up to midnight reading it to find out what the group of kids are up to. There is romance and action all in one book. I highly recommend this book.
3,another interesting concept from scott westerfield,"Not as good as the Uglies trilogy, but a new unique concept. INteresting unusual plot line, fast-paced, good characters. I'll definitely be reading the next one in the series"
2,A few high points but mostly dull,Aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one. For the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible (and unmelodic) climax. There are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring Jungle Brothers and 13 featuring N.W.A. But for the most part the rappers take center stage and Aphrodite doesn't add much. If you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled CD.
4,SONGS ARE CATCHY& FUN,"The songs contained on this CD are catchy and fun to listen to. I find myself singing the songs days later, they will pop into my head suddenly."
3,A bit of fun,This album gives a whole new outlook to the way we think about earlier music. It makes people laugh and forget their steps at jive class. What more could you possibly want out of life?
5,Explicit lyrics?,"I used to listen to these songs when I was a kid. For along time we didn't get the double meanings. When we eventually were told we laughed. It may have been explicit in the 40's and 50's, but today I'm surprised they don't jump rope to the songs in the playground. Even back in the 70's we took some of the songs to school and played them for our 7th grade teacher(after shool hours, of course) and she was delighted! I LOVE Ruth Wallis!"
1,Useless,"250 8x11 pages without a single picture, drawing, image, graphic, table, graph or equation. Zero. Not one.The section on calculating the net impedance of speakers without an equation is hilarious: ""This means turning each number on its head, then adding the numbers in this form, then changing the resulting number back to ordinary form.""I bet you have never thought of an XLR connector as ""three small round pins/holes forming a triangular pattern inside an 18mm diameter circle.""There is also some questionable information, such as ""the gain setting knobs [on an amplifier] should generally be set at maximum..."" Never seen that one in print.Much better choices for an actual book are Davis: ""Sound Reinforcement Handbook"" and Stark: ""Live Sound Reinforcement""."
2,"Good, but...","I wanted a few books for reference, to share with working musician friends. This book does seem to be complete, but, with its total lack of diagrams and illustrations, really makes for very boring reading.I would recommend instead this book: ""Live Sound Reinforcement: A Comprehensive Guide to P.A. and Music Reinforcement Systems and Technology"", ISBN 0918371074.Another excellent sound reference is the Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook, from Hal Leonard (# HL 00500964). A littl e more detailed than the above recommended book, but still good for both beginners and experts."
4,How the children really fail?,"The book How Children Fail by John Holt is a really good book to compare and contrast education in the 1960's and 2004. Students can read and respond to the ideas and opinions about education on this book. This book has also shown me that most of all the teachers actually do care about students'. I found out that what Holt says is true in many cases. Holt says that all teachers teach students the same way and some students learn but not the other students because the teacher doesn't know how to teach them the right way. After reading this book, I asked myself a question: why do the teachers let themselves get tapped by the same tricks they used with their teachers when they were going to school?"
4,Thoughts on How Children Fail,"Before reading How Children Fail by John Holt, we assumed the book discussed the imperfections of children and why they are unsuccessful. After reading the entire book, we realized our assumption was wrong. Holt explains the ways schools, teachers, and parents fail in a journalistic style. He discusses the fear in children of adults, strategies children use in the classroom, that real learning does exist, and how schools can improve to better suit the children atttending them. We recommend this book to all teachers and parents that are trying to help their children receive the best education possible. Though written in the 1960's, Holt provides his audience with many provisions that could still be used even today."
5,How do we teach children to learn?,"I give the book How Children Fail by John Holt five star. I felt that this is a well writen book about school system and teachers. John Holt took time to go into other teachers classrooms and pick up on there mistakes to improve on his teaching abilities. He also took time to analyze all the children in his own classroom, to find out what was the best way to teach them so that they will listen and learn. I feel that at some point teachers should take a look at this book to open up thier minds about teaching."
4,Good Read For Teachers,"I think that Holt has many strong points and a lot of original ideas concerning formal education. You can definately tell he feels strongly against the normal school environment. Some of the real classroom interactions he had are interesting and informative, but they ,at times, are irrelavent. I would recommend How Children Fail to all people who want to become a teacher, but most other people would think Holt is extremely boring."
4,How Children Fail,"I am a college student at Macon State College majoring in elementary education. I am currently enrolled in EDUC 1000, the Introduction to Elementary Education. At the beginning of this semester we were assigned to choose an educational book. I chose How Children Fail, and I think I really did make a good choice. As I started reading, I was not very interested because of the format of the book, the journal entries. I continued reading and began to enjoy the book more and more. As I reached the summary at the end, I was able to put all of the information I had read together and it seemed to make more and more sense. After all, I really did enjoy reading this book. It enabled me, as a future educator, to see what I can do for my future students so they will not fail. I want to make a difference in the lives of my students, so I feel that by reading this book and other educational books, I will be able to gain knowledge that I will need to know as a future educator."
3,Decent,"John Holt's book, How Children Fail, was a decent and fair book. We think that it brings a different reality of school life. We think that there are certain points in the book that Holt points out that are a little ""far fetched"" and may not work as well as he thinks. We think that it's very interesting that Holt goes from class to class observing students to see how they participate in class, and then he tries to come up with solutions to help them become better students. Holt's ideas may work differently with different students, which is also interesting because he is able to think like the students. So we gave John Holt's book, How Children Fail, 3 stars because we feel that his intentions are good, but some points are irrelevent."
2,Good for Some,"I believe that John Holt's book, How Children Fail, is a great tool for teachers who don't have a clue about teaching. It goes into too much detail in some parts about how different children learn and how the teacher can help those children. The book is good for students who are going into teaching, while for others it just drags on. With re-writing the book, Holt looked back at what he said previously and explained how teaching styles changed. Over all, read How Children Fail if you're interested in learning why your child or you yourself can't learn. Not a good book for just free time."
2,How Children Fail,Our opinion about John Holt's book is very two sided because he talked mostly about what he observed in his own way about students. John Holt was very pointless on many occasions about what he was writing about in How Children Fail. Why couldn't he write something positive about children on why they fail? Some children have different learning styles and that's why some fail. The book in our opinion needed to have a different topic and have some other meanings to it because he never talked about what type of things that children can do to make them stop failing and what type of teachings that they can get.
1,What?,"This book was awful. Mr. Holt talks about these children as if they were some of the numbers on one of his off-the-wall math tests. He was rude and very uncaring. He used words like:""Stupid"", ""Ignorant"", ""Foolish."" These are words that I would never use to describe anyone; adult or child! I was very angered, especially about his description of a ""retarded child."" He stated,""What first struck me about this child, as so often is the case with seriously retarded children, was the extraordinary ugliness of her face."" What? Since when can anyone control the way they look; and to think that this child was handicapped. Now I am all for someone having and forming their own opinion, but in no way would I take my uneducated views and published them in a book, then place a title on it that had the words,""Children"" and ""Fail"" in it. I do not recommend this book."
4,I prefer his later work,"This book is one of John Holt's earliest published works. At this stage he still thinks that schools are essentially very good (and very necessary) institutions with a few things wrong with them that it is quite possible to fix. Later he becomes disillusioned with that notion, and begins to advocate alternative schools. Eventually he realizes that the very nature of schooling and the assumptions it is built upon go against some of his most dearly held ideals, and he begins to advocate 'unschooling,' starting the publication ""Growing Without Schooling"" and the organization Holt Associates.I think that this book is a valuable read if you want to understand the evolution of Holt's thoughts about education, but I would also recommend you take a look at his later works. Personally, I'm a big fan of ""Teach Your Own."""
4,Insights for Teachers,"Being an education major I was assigned this book for a class project. It is an interesting day by day journal of author John Holt's experience as a teacher in a Colorado private school. Holt's insights are honest and convey what some of the major problems are with todays students. The book's strength comes from the way Holt sees through the eyes of children who desperately want to please the adults who teach them but, out of fear hold back their talents for learning. Although the book is sixteen years old it remains a strong indictment of our modern educational system. I strongly recommend this read for anyone entering the field of education."
3,Informative but.....,"After spending a year volunteering weekly in my sons class and then reading this book I found that what the author observed was exactly what I too saw in the classroom. If you've never spent alot of time in a classroom you would find many things in this book hard to believe. The sad truth of the matter is that it's all true. This book provides a wonderful insight into the classroom, but it is hard to get through. This is the sort of book that will put you to sleep if you aren't fully alert, but if you can get through it you will be glad you did."
4,Positive and Negative,"In John Holt's book How Children Fail,he speaks about the positive and the negative of the school system. Some of what he said was useful and some not. This book was written in the 1960s so a lot of things have changed. Overall this book was a good book that taught me alot about ways to make children learn better. This book should be recommended to parents and teachers becasue it explains ways to get inside of the child's mind and understand how it works.It's easier to teach children more now with new technology and greater resources so some of what John Holt said is out of date."
4,Great Product,"Great and perfect for my cell phone. Adapter makes easy use to plug into my computer. Be careful if you try to buy a bigger capacity, some cell phones will only recognize 1 gig even if you have a bigger sized card."
5,"Very mystycal and exciting music, a world of surprise.","This album offers extreme rarity. The type of musical exposure is not found on any other recording. Several songs have very good melodious tune, and a great listening pieces, others offer something never heard before. A great buy at Amazon, highly recommended."
2,A Novelty Item,"Unless you are really into Pink Floyd's most avant garde stuff (Atom Heart Mother and the Ummagumma studio album), you are unlikely to listen to this more than a couple of times. It gives only a little bit more insight as to what Pink Floyd would become. The other soundtrack albums from that period (including the often-overlooked Zabriskie Point) do much better in this regard. It has almost absolutely nothing in common with the material he wrote after The Dark Side of the Moon. If you are a Pink Floyd completist, go ahead and get it, but you will probably find that it compares with Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports as the least important Pink Floyd solo album."
2,Absolutely hilarious!,"This is the most hilariously terrible album I've ever heard, apart from Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart. There are certainly worse albums out there, i.e the really bland ones. This is not bland, it's just absolutely ghastly unlistenable music! It's mostly some bloke called Ron Geesin doing things to musical instruments which are probably illegal in some parts of the world, with a few quite mellow and actually OK Roger Waters tracks thrown in. Utter rubbish, but the sort of utter rubbish every true music fan ought to have in their collection!"
5,We know...,"there are more than 7 dwarfs in the infamous P-land. We've been there and we've been there. Geert and I, great friends as we share three plastic teeth between us, have had many an embryonic thought in our life. In fact: you could characterise our whole life as being embryonic. We're still in mental dipers. Waters and Geesin understand this and provide the perfect soundtrack to our lives. 'Lick your partners' they say, and we obey. And then... we give birth to a smile. Music from the body, music from the heart. By the way, the new Jantje Smit-album has hit the streets last monday - check it out!"
1,"I Love Roger, but this album is NOT GOOD","Buy all of his other work, there is only one song worth listening to, Give birth to a smile. The rest sounds like kids made it. Sorry, but don't buy this one."
5,Waters needs floyd....,"This album, simmilar in heart to umma gumma, shows again that waters was not the musical genuis of floyd..."
4,Loved the black humour,"Really enjoyed this very Aussie memoir of one woman's struggle with body image and eating disorders. Even though you may not have taken things as far as the author has, or dealt with the same problems, I think every woman will see a little something of herself there. Definitely made me think very hard about some of my internal dialogue, especially now I have a daughter..."
2,Good girls do swallow,Rubbish full of same old same old did she cut and paste from other sources. I know this woman much of the book is just crap and lies and I know for a fact she never lost that much of gained that much.Don't waste your money
5,Meeting the Ethical Challenges of Leadership: Casting Light or Shadow,"I just recently completed an Ethical Leadership class..My Instructor selected this book as our textbook. I can honestly say that he could not have chosen a better book. This book really allows you to understand Ethics and Ethical Leadership. It also forced me to take an honest assessment of myself as well. When I say ""honest assessment"", I'm merely saying it enabled me to see if I was operating ethically in all levels of my life. I must admit there is room for improvement, which I am currently working on.Excellent book...I refuse to sell this one, I will hold on to as a reference/guide.Thank you."
2,Ethical Challenges,This is an excellent book. I read the introduction and did not want to put this book down.
5,the Duke,"I have seen this movie many times and know the background of the writing of it, and the fact that it was based on a true story. Of course you have to like John Wayne (which I DO!!!) and his cast of fellow actors that tend to surround him.. and Maureen O'Hara I can't get enough of! This story made me cry,.. made me mad, made me proud."
5,John Wayne Movie,"I was so surprised that my order arrived so quickly and in great condition. I will be ordering from here again.Thanks,Charles H. Day"
5,As described.,"I had viewed the movie several times prior to this purchase and am slowly replacing my VHS movies.This is a good DVD copy without any bad spaces, both video and audio."
4,One of Wayne's best,"A true story with proper respect paid to the primary character that is played by Wayne. Interesting family dynamics for the time period are explored and dealt with in a fashion not dissimilar to what we might find today.The spinal cord injury is properly staged for the time and still holds relevance as a positive mental attitude and commitment are still primary recovery protocols.Not his usual ""shoot'em up"" but the ending is Wayne all the way.Doug k"
4,Wayne and O'Hara teamed up again...,"Wayne plays the lead in this biographical story of one of the pioneers of US naval air power, ""Spig"" Whead (sp?). O'Hara plays the camp-following wife, until she's had enough and sends Wayne off to fly with the boys.Things get really interesting when Wayne comes home.There's love, frustration, and reunitings all throughout."
1,Wings of Eagles,"Sorry, but I'am very angry. We did not get our movies from dvdlegeacy. So I only know that dvdlegeacy took our money from our account and never sent the movies I ordered. I hope Amazon will make good on this action. Either to send the movies or return our money. Thank You Susanne Reeves"
1,I never received my order.,"What else can I say - I've never gotten the DVD I ordered, The Wings of Eagles.Joyce"
3,Great Cast. Great Story. OK Movie,"It is hard ot believe that the same team that gave us ""The Quiet Man"" is at work here.A sense of whimsy and fun permeates that movie. In that film even the darker moments bring a weight and seriousness that makes the humour all the better.Here the movie never rises above mediocre. The light moments of the film just seem to make the characters look like fools and the dark moments seem to be about what you would expect they deserve. One side note, A lot of this movie takes place in the hospital and I loved watching the doctors standing around smoking cigaretes as they looked at Xrays orconsulted with patients.I never really felt any concern for the relationship between Wayne and O'Hara and I wondered early on why they didn't just divorce and get it over with.perhaps I am too hard on this film, but I felt let down that this movie did not live up to the standards set by so many classics produced by this team."
1,one more chopped film is now in the pipe,"We have a new victim in the vecinity. Unwelcome! Title: see above. A small, juicy, masterpiece by Jack Ford has been cut from the original 1,33:1 format to 1,85:1. We are left only with the small consolation to deplore it. More: we have been deprieved of the real product for HOW LONG?. Shame!"
5,"A forgotten classic, the best of its kind","There were any number of bands like the Doughboys in the late eighties and early nineties, but none that achieved the same kind of symphonic quality in their music, and ""Home Again"" is living proof of that. It's all about the vocals-if I recall correctly, all four members of the band sang on every song. They don't harmonize so much as sing in chorus, all the while playing extremely fast with many tempo changes and even the occasional modulation. It's almost like what would happen if Crosby Stills and Nash played as a punk band, minus the sentimentality. I first listened to this album at fifteen and now, at 31, still consider it one of the most remarkable rock recordings I've ever encountered."
3,Accordian Gate,"Unit sufficient for my needs and priced right. However, not very sturdy or heavily built and would not recommend for use as a child gate."
4,Great Diet product,"I purchased this liquid for a diet program and have been very happy with it. It is not as sweet as the packets of stevia but in my tea or water it's great. Will continue to purchase this, just for sweeter preference (ex. strawberries) I still use the packets."
4,Love stevia! Good product at a good price,"I love stevia and think it has a pleasant taste, without that artifical sweetener aftertaste. This product is great for adding a few drops to tea, coffee, drizzle a few drops over some berries and yogurt, etc. It's pretty sweet so you don't need a lot to get sweetness. The only comment I would make is that I've used the Now brand liquid Stevia before, which has a thicker consistency and I like that consistency because it's a bit harder to overdose when the liquid takes a bit of get out of the dropper! This liquid stevia is like water and it's easy to get too much. Otherwise, a really good product at a good price."
5,Great alternative to sugar!,"Great price for stevia and a great alternative to sugar, especially for those w/ blood sugar issues."
1,Sweetening disappointing,"It may be a good health supplement but I bought it primarily for using it as a healthy sweetener (I am diabetic). It has hardly any sweetening effect. I have tried upto 5 drops in half a cup of coffee and also tea. I bought two bottles, for home and work."
5,great,"The Green Bay Packers hat was received quickly and in great condition. My fiance loved it-his last one blew away in a wind storm and now he's back to being a ""cheesehead""."
5,Very Happy with product.,Shipping was very fast. Product has an easy open package. Just pull open no need for scissors. Product last much longer than other hanging toilet cleaners. Very Happy and will order again.
2,Several Steps too Few,"I am really fond of mysteries, but I like for them to be at least plausible. If you don't mind stories with gaps too large to connect, then you might enjoy this one."
3,very good remake almost,"This is a very good ""remake"" of the original classic Hitchcock thriller. It strays from the original storyline with several plot changes which only add to the enjoyment and interest of the story and actually improve on the original storyline. All the casting is well done. In particular, real chemistry appears between the two romantic leads who are well acted. However, the movie is almost spoiled by the ending. It simply needed a happy ending to finish what was until then a very entertaining movie."
4,Oh! So close!,"I mostly enjoyed this remake of The 39 Steps: the pacing was good, the actors well cast, the scenery beautiful. But why, oh why do screenwriters still imagine--in the 21st century--that they are writing a ""strong"" woman character by making her mindlessly opinionated, stubborn, arrogant and aggressively shrill?!! Is it so inconceivable that a strong woman could be quietly, intelligently self-confident? It's always disappointing to see a well-done film flawed by this kind of stereotyping. My other complaint is that once the two main characters do come to understand one another and develop mutual trust, respect, and love, the screenwriters change the film's ending and sabotage the couple's possible future relationship, which was very sad. Very unnecessary and very much a let-down. I much prefer the quiet conclusion at the end of the original film, which leaves the viewer with a sense of a hopeful future, both for the couple and their country."
2,Suprisingly bad,"Just rent the Hitchcock movie, because this is a disappointing version of this classic tale. The actors are bland, the sets are cheap, the intrigue is almost nonexistent."
3,Not bad,I gave it this rating because I thought it could have been more intense and exciting. It's what I call a middle road picture.
3,"Workmanlike, But a Good Cast","I expected a remake of the famous Hitchcock film, but although this one does followthe original John Buchan premise in the novel that started it all off,it lacks the details that make Hitchcock's version so crazy andfascinating, such as Mr. Memory. There is a Hitchcockian touch--no spoiler here--onthe protagonist's train ride. I won't say what it is, but it really brings back theunnerving fantasy-realism you get in Hitchock's thrillers. There is also the problemthat the two leads often put themselves into ridiculously dangerous situations in a waythat nobody would in real life. Still, the thing moves along at a good clip, the playersare fine (especially the two leads), and the DVD, though made for television, hasthe roomy presence of a film."
5,Funny little remake,"This is a sweet version of a classic, highly recommend it. And hey it is cheap why not? The actors do a great job with the characters and nothing beats the plane chase!"
4,39 Fun Steps,"This newest version of 39 Steps is a truly enjoyable film - suspenseful, subtle, funny, and with engaging characters. Another well-made and well-acted production from the BBC. Highly recommended."
4,REMASTER ANYONE?!,"I find myself torn with this collection. It is great to have all of these albums and singles collected in one nice concise package. But why was this set not remastered along with the rest of their stuff in 2001? So if one wants the better mastering, one has to rebuy these albums individually. ADKOT goes for $50 used! EMI, please remaster this box set!"
1,"Not ""luxury"" to me","This book contains 209 floor plans, but none of them are distinctive or luxury in any way. Almost half of the book contains homes under 2,500 square feet and the largest is 5,620 sq. ft. As a matter of fact, ony 18 plans are over 3,500 sq. ft. If you are looking for small home plans, there is definitely a variety in this book, though none of them were particularly interesting. I was looking for plans over 5,000 sq. ft., which I usually find in ""luxury"" books. I see nothing ""luxury"" about these plain, small houses."
3,SHE AINT NO MIA X,"FIRST OFF, LET ME SAY THAT NO LIMIT RECORDS IS #1 REGARDLESS, BUT THIS ALBUM AINT ALL THAT IT COULD BE. MERCEDES CAN RAP, BUT SHE AINT ALL THAT. SHE'S DEFINETLY NO BRAT, GANGSTA BOO OR MIA X! I THINK THERE ARE WAY TO MANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THESE SONGS. CAN SHE NOT DO A WHOLE SONG BY HERSELF? I THINK I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS MERCEDES CD IF SHE ACTUALLY DID AT LEAST ONE SOLO. PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE LONG AWAITED THIS ALBUM, THATS RIGHT BECAUSE ALL YA'LL SEEN WAS HER TAIL ON THE COVER AND YOU WERE READY TO BUY IT. P I LOVE YOU BUT SOME HOOCHIES DON'T HAVE TALENT."
1,!?,"This is NASTY music! I can't believe I wasted money on thi- OMG! OMG! I WASTED (dollar ammount)!! GAH! neway, the beats (...), and the lyrics are just too raunchy and don't even make sense! She'd be better off in the porn industry. GO BACK! GO BACK! (and give me back my fourteen dollars)"
4,its good,"this cd is cool. if u want some ghetto love r&b and some rap this is the cd to get. my fav songs are you can tell, bonnie and clyde,ni&&a's aint sh$$,and plus some more its cool just listen to the sample, i wonder if she will ever come back out with another cd,"
4,"Oustanding movie about fine man, and very good future President!","The absolute best performance of actorRobertson's career. Story of young Lt.John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who VOLUNTEEREDfor hazardous PT boat duty in World WarII, despite his, brother and father'sprevious role in Patriotic America FirstCommittee, that TRIED in vain to keep theUS out of World War II. Just like Pilot/Aviator Charles Lindbergh, Jr. Kennedybacked the Soviets down in '62 and prob-ably kept the world from nuclear war, butthe Establishment keeps lying about alled-ged affairs AFTER HE'S BEEN DEAD AND GONEAND CANNOT DEFEND HIMSELF! Absolute rubbish!The Masons, Zionists and others may hate himbut real Americans have been telling thetruth about him for years; Col. L. FletcherProuty, Tom Valentine, Bo Gritz, and yes,Rich Salzer!"
3,"PT 109, Helps out the scale modler!","I find that this movie is an excellent source for details on PT Boats. The action in it quite good and in the beginning fast pace. The major flaw is the music score. It is very loud, very repitious and at some points, very annoying. The other problem with the movie is the use of air craft that hadn't been built yet."
2,Unable to View,"I only watcd DVD's & movies on my computer - decided to try one of Amazon DVD-R special orders (it was cheap) even though it stated that it might not work on Computers wanted to try at least once..Found out it really does not work on a computer - disappointed that Amazon does not allow certain, hard to find movies to be produced that are viewable thru a computer..Will never try another DVD-R put out by Amazon"
4,PT-109,It is a classic war film and I would strongly recommend it to all as it is a story of service and survival in World War 11 by John F. Kennedy. I think Cliff Robertson portrayed him very well.
3,Hollywood's Love Affair with Jack Kennedy,"All of America was in Love with our Youthful New President in the Early Sixties, Hollywood included. Not to take away anything from our former President's War Service, something lacking in today's leadership, but how you let a PT boat capable of 50kts get run down by a Japanese Destroyer is beyond me, though the Heroic Events following were Noteworthy."
4,good movie for younger viewers,"The movie as a whole was entertaining for it's time but not very accurate about real events that actually took place. To the reviewer from Baltimore: To understand how a craft such as this got rammed you need to understand how these boats patroled ,which by the way was always done at night and usually idiling on one engine (out of three) which at times never responded very well on quick response. Take it from a Navy veteran ,its very dark at sea at night. I for one review it as a very non-violent & entertaining film for younger and older viewers alike"
4,PT 109,"Yes it is a very good movie, I remember seeing it for the 1st time with my Dad at the theater in 1963. He was in the US Navy, and it is Hollywood, but it does show the story of how and what happened with former President Kennedy, while he was in the South Pacific during WWII."
5,Great War Movie,This is a gift for my dad who loves it. He was so happy to get a new copy rather than a used copy.
3,Ty Hardin,"this movie was unknow for me and bought it only because I'm Ty Hardin fan.Not the best but interessting movie about the early life of the later US-President J.F. Kennedy who's serving in the WW2.THE DVD:its a DVD-R, without any subtitles.Picture-quality: good, but not perfect.Interessting: uncredited: George Takei who became later world famous in the Star Trek original Serie is playing a Helmsman on Japanese Destroyer and Andrew Duggan is the Narrator."
4,pt-109,It was a good movie. It must have been hard on the men and there shipmate .To see so much action. And also for there family. Thank all of you for your giving your all. God Bless You All.
2,Counting Crows: Will 2 albums be enough?,"""August & Everything After"" and ""Hard Candy"" are up there with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". In my top 100 favorite CDs. The other stuff? Only one decent song from ""Satellites""?BUT:Hey guys, stay with that ""August"" quality and quit waffling around with the subsequent mediocre stuff. Stay true to your form please.Seth"
4,Best Of?,"The thing that I find about Counting Crows fans is that everyone has their own favorite set of songs. Most are on here but some are left off, the new songs made me want to buy it. I basically have all the studio CD's, so i made my own best of CD. As for the 4 ""new"" songs, isnt iTunes great ;-)."
2,Songs taken out of context,"Yes, these are all great songs. Anyone who knows Counting Crows knows of most if not all of these hits. However, the appeal of the band is that they produce albums that hang together as whole works, and by taking these songs out of their original context and placing them haphazardly next to one another here, much of their magic is lost.So don't buy Films about Ghosts, buy August and Everything After and introduce yourself properly to one of the great bands of the 90s. Then enjoy it so much you buy all the rest as well. Maybe."
2,It's a bland pop record.,"At one time people compared them to Van Morrison and The Band, but sadly it's been almost 10 years since they've released anything worth a damn. What happened to those guys who released August and Everything After in '93?"
4,They converted another WF fan,"I first herd about the Counting Crows through the band ""The Wallflowers"". I figured if the toured together the CC can't be bad. I had never heard any of the CC songs in till I first put the CD. The first time I played it I skipped around. I finally listen to the CD the whole way through at 4 in the morning at a friends house when i could not sleep. I will remember the dark seemed perfect for playing it. This is a CD I am glad I bought. With upbeat songs like Hanging around that made me sing along to the slow Long December. In each of the songs the CC seemed to capture my moods. They have a song in the CD for every emotion you could be feeling. It's one of the few CD's you can get in to I found myself singing along to ""American Girls"" on the bus. If you were to buy one CD this year let it be Films About Ghosts"
3,Good,"Well, I appreciate a good rock, and I can say for sure, this album contains good songs. I recommend to everyone."
4,It's a good album.,"Always sort of liked the counting crows. They were never quite my favorite but the music really is solid, easy to enjoy. A couple of less than great songs on this one but it was worth the money."
5,A Complete Masterpiece,"A huge Counting Crows fan, I was delighted when my brother bought Films About Ghosts the other day. I immediately fell in love with the new song She Don't Want Nobody Near. The entire CD is perfect - the only fault perhaps being that there are so many more of their songs that you want to add on there as well. Such a talented band, Counting Crows is unparalleled in the music business and their lyrics are wonderful! Buy this CD - you won't regret it."
5,Counting Crows- Films about Ghosts- Fabulous!,"This is truly one of the greatest ""Best of"" albums out there. This disk has an excellent and comprehensive sampling of Counting Crows music. My favorite tracks are ""Einstein on the Beach"" and ""Rain King"". And of course, their brilliant cover of the Grateful Dead's ""Friend of the Devil"". If you have loved the Counting Crows, but haven't endeavored to purchase any of their music until now.. Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection. You'll be happy you did! It is a wonderful entree into the poetic lyrical genius of the Crows and culls out the less than desirable songs from their other albums."
5,Films about ghosts,"Counting Crows were one of the most underratede bands of the 90's. On this greatest hits collection you hear thier diversity in musical styles and the intelligent lyrics that set them apart. Track from their first 4 albums give great insight into thier souls as they were making them. The new version of this album includes ths Shrek song ""accidently in love,""Films About Ghosts: The Best Of...one of thier best to never appear on one of thier albums until now."
5,Great book for the novice rat enthusiast,"The author has a genuine love of rats as pets that we members of ""rodentia"" can appreciate, she provides illuminating insights into the care, feeding, housing and (very important) providing of entertainment to our precious ""ratties"" and ""rattinas"". Her book has proved INvaluable in repect to the references for rat illnesses. I heartily recommend to any rat fancying household. By the way, to the unconverted;they are way better pets for your kids than a hamster."
3,Pet Rat,my daughter who is 10 has a pet rat named gizmo he is 2 month old and a very sweet rat she loves him and he loves her rats are great pets
2,Anita's Most Depressing Novel Yet!,"I've read most of Brookner's novels. I've recommended her work to others, but I cannot recommend this book. Her characters are often passive but the two women in The Bay of Angels excel at inertia. Brookner's beautiful style doesn't compensate for how very depressing this novel is. The women in this book can't seem to DO anything."
3,Where's the Beef,"Anita Brookner writes lovely prose; unfortunately she seems, at least in this novel, to have nothing to say. The characters are not involving, the story is virtually non-existent. Unless you feel like being mesmerized by the rhythm of beautiful prose, I'd give this one a miss. Even the writing can be a bit much at times; I could not help but be taken aback that any writer could find a use for the word ""nugatory"" twice within a few pages. All style; no substance."
1,reading this book is like eating plastic,"This is the first book by this author I've ever read, and it'll be the last. I had to grit my teeth to get through to the end. The narrator rambles on and on and on about her pathetic boring life, and everything is always about her. It seems that she expects everyone else to take care of her: her step father should have left her and her mother more money when he died (the flat and the bank accounts he gave her obviously weren't good enough); the doctors should have paid her more attention, both in and out of the hospitals; the proprietor should have been kinder; her mother should have taken care of herself; the stepfather's nephew should have let her stay in the house... Even in the end, she never learned to stand on her own feet. What a sorry existence!"
3,Well...,"I am perhaps one of the most rabid of the countless readers who eagerly await each year's new Anita Brookner novel, but, I have to admit, I was fairly disappointed in this one. I can't help feeling I must have missed something, because I am stunned by how utterly uninvolving the characters and the plot were to me. Brookner's prose, as always, is breathtaking, so I would recommend this to any fan, with the caveat: ""Wait for the paperback"". New Brookner readers would do better to start with Look at Me and Hotel du Lac or my more recent favorites, Falling Slowly and Undue Influence"
2,"Depressed, boring, passive, weak women","I've been listening to the book on tape, and am giving up. The characters are totally self-absorbed, shallow and uninteresting. A story may develop as time goes on, and Zoe may find some gumption and energy by the end of the book, but Brookner takes too many pages for me to persevere. Sorry."
2,Quality doesn't seem up to old dashmat standards,"I have a dashmat from years ago for the same car, now I have a second. The new dashmats are really poor workmanship in comparison. It looks like a reject. Major sewing errors and miscuts, sloppy factory defects. I had to send it back.I already have same exact mat from years ago that always fit correctly, this one is ridiculous, not right at all. I'll try a different brand, I guess.I also ordered for a different car and that one had less defects so we kept it. Still, We will do some sewing to correct one poor detail."
3,Chilly Scenes of Winter,The sad story of a man in love with a woman who doesn't return his affections. Josie
5,WRC World Rally Championship Flat Out,The WRC is in my mind the finest racing on this planet. I look forward to view 2008 and hope to obtain it from Amazon.
4,great dream book,This is a great book for decoding your dreams. I've read alot of these books & I finally decided to buy this one. I would definately recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about their dreams & what they mean.
1,HORRIBLE!---GAVE ME A HEADACHE---,"Amateurish and poorly written. The main female character was an insult to women everywhere. If she had to 'suppress a giggle' one more time I might have roared. I don't expect a lot out of Harlequin-type stories. They are good for a quick downtime when you're in need of a happy-ever-after type ending, but this book was pitiful. It had no plot, no interest, no substance, and no romance. My sixth-grader could have done a better job."
5,Sounds like nothing else,"A piece of magic. Hard to explain this album... just that there is nothing comperable. Did anybody ever before made something like that one? No. Noone. Dance is original, haunting, creepy, majestic, very deep, mystic, futuristic and in a way pop, but out of business anyway . If I had to put it down: Listen and think it over for yourself. It's Numan after Telekon... exploring new boundaries with a broken heart."
5,If you like numan you will like this CD,"I have been into gary numan for several years now, and I am 20 years old. I got this album originally when I was 18, and was immediately impressed. It is the type of CD that grows on you. Dont be scarred away by albums such as berserker, the fury, or machine and soul. These were some of numans worst. Well dance I would classify as the last of the 'classic' numan. It is definitely different from the telekon sound, or any sound on a numan album. But it contains the essential elements needed for a great numan recording. A song that not a lot of people have mentioned in these reviews is 'moral.' Moral is the sequal to the song 'metal' that was released on the pleasure principle album and also served as a b side to cars. Its fun to listen to metal then moral sequentially. Another great song is 'stories' that has a very creepy theme paired with a very creepy sound. Numans talents really shine in this epic recording."
4,Cool pup,"It's similar in quality as a real basketball jersey. Not crazy about the color, which is the only choice and the size fit him a bit large (only size available), but I'm happy with it. My Maltese ""Snoopy"" was chillin' with this jersey :)I wish the Snoop Dogg line was expanded with more clothing not so much the toys."
1,Poor quality and poor customer service,"I rarely rate items...but in this case, I am so irate that I will do everything I can to prevent other shoppers from making the mistake I did.We purchased 4 of these Venus barstools 2 1/2 years ago - primarily because they are adjustable. The visual appearance is very good...but the quality of the ""gas lift"" air cylinder is poor. Two of these gas lifts have failed. I have contacted Hillsdale furniture direct, and was told that these chairs are now made by a new manufacture...and parts are not available for our barstools. (I have the email)This means that we basically have to throw out our chairs and start over. (over $600 invested)Do not buy...unless you only need your chairs to last 2 years!"
4,Great Stools!,I love these stools. My design skills aren't the best so I was a bit reluctant to roll the dice sight unseen on a pretty expensive item but they are perfect with my decor. The quality is solid and the assembly was easy. I love that the height is adjustable so I didn't have to be concerned about counter height. The only reason that I'm not giving them five stars is that they aren't all that comfortable but that they look great and seem like they are built well outweighs that. It's not like you sit in a bar stool for eight hours at a time right?
2,Not enough of Ann Margret!,"Bought this as I am an Ann Margret fan, but she is really not in the film enough. The story is really not very interesting at all. Not a must see!"
3,More of Ann Margret,I'm a huge fan of Ann Margret. In my searches for films with her in it I found R.P.M.. I don't think the interaction between Anthony Quinn and Ann Margret worked for me. In fact maybe that's why this movie is a bit hard to find. In any case it's Ann Margret and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
4,teacher uses in High School Classroom,"This is a good book, I teach and use it in a high school classroom.Good explinations for beginner programmer, (minor changes needed to code since book has been out a long time... i.e. 'using namespace std'). Code examples download_able from the internet."
2,Not adequate for AP Computer Science,"We use this book in our AP Computer Science class, and although it is easy to read, it lacks a lot of detail. I do not recommend this book to anyone studying for the AP Computer Science AB exam."
4,Good learning,"Both as a reference and an introduction to various subjects, this book has served well as out C++ class's primary textbook. It has projects at the end that you have to learn from even if you couldn't quite get the rest of it. Excellent stuff."
4,Book deals with German economic policy after WW2,This book covers excellent the german economic performance after worldwar 2. The economic system chosen and the implications of the policy chosen. It analyses the recovery and the outperformance after the war and shows the upcoming weaknesses of the German economy. Shortyly the reunification is mentioned and the economic implications of it. This book however is at this moment a bit dated as it doesn't tell the story of the last few years. Still the book shows what the structurual weaknesses (and strong points) are and it points forward towards the current bad economic performance. Recommended when interesting in an in depth analysis of the German economy.
5,A well-research scholarly work on the novel.,"Ian Watt's exhaustive scholarly work on the emergence of the novel has proven invaluable in identifying what were the factors that allowed the novel to take its place in the history of English literature. With particular reference to Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, Watt gives an in-depth exploration of the growth of the middle class, the increase of literary habits of the general population through the rise of the city, the availability of the printing press and an interest in the woes and triumphs of the plight of the woman in the late eighteenth century. Well worth the read for those in college literature classes."
5,Must read for literary scholars.,What? No reviews of this classic? You cannot pretend to understand the novel in English if you've not read this.
3,Rather one sided...,"I'll agree this book is a staple in the canon of literary criticism and the history of the novel, but what about women writers? I think this book's short coming is its oversight of authors such as Burney, Edgeworth, and Lennox."
5,Billy Liar,"Melding British kitchen-sink realism with fanciful sequences that dramatize Billy's reveries, director Schlesinger got his name on the map with this brilliant satire, partly inspired by James Thurber's classic story ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" Courtenay is a marvel as Billy, the blue-collar drudge whose reliance on his inner life earns him a reputation as an unreliable dreamer. Mona Washbourne also excels as Alice, Billy's daffy, sympathetic mother."
4,a film about a daydreamer,"This review is forthe Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film based on the Keith Waterhouse novel is a gem of British cinema.The film is about a young man named William ""Billy"" Fisher. He has many daydreams about being the leader of a fictional country called Ambrosia. He has made several mistakes at his job and tells lies to avoid getting himself into trouble. He then needs to tell even bigger lies to cover his tracks and ends up being believed by nobody.The film has good acting including an early starring role of Julie Christie. The film laso has some humorous scenes including a bagpipe marching band parading through a grocery store.Th DVD also has special features which consist of a theatrical trailer, audio commentary by director John Schlesinger, actor Tom Courtenay, and actress Julie Christie.This is another film that defined British comedy and should be seen by fans of the genre"
4,Dense but good,"This book is dense with fairly small print, small margins and long chapters without section breaks; but, it is well written and does a good job showing the complexities and intricacies of scripture that lend credence to its inspiration. The author's perspective that scripture is historicised fiction can be ignored for the rest of the benefits of reading this book. Frankly, the argument for historicised fiction could just as well be used to suggest its inspiration.Needless to say, as a result of reading this book, I bought Alter's book on Biblical Poetry."
4,Great Source document on Biblical Narrative,I found this book to be a very helpful source in learning of the techniques utilized in discovering the biblicl narrative of the Old Testament.
5,A must-read for anyone who loves the Bible,"Having learned in school all about the so-called ""documentary hypothesis"" in which the Hebrew Bible, and particularly the Penteteuch, are declared to be poorly stitched-together compilations of separate or competing documents, Alter's book provides a much needed corrective. His detailed and thoughtful arguments show that the stories, as they stand today, represent an ancient form of literary art that most modern folks simply haven't learned to recognize. The only fault I find is that Alter seems to believe that since the biblical stories demonstrate such a high degree of literary artistry, we therefore should regard some of these stories and characters as fictional. To me, the matter of historicity is entirely separate from the degree of literary skill exhibited in the stories. For a fuller perspective, I suggest you read this book in conjunction with Kitchen's book, ""On the Reliability of the Old Testament."""
2,Disappointing and depressing,"Tried to get through this a couple of times, but it was just too dated and depressing. Maybe I stopped too soon."
3,Ax 87th Precinct review,"Murderer came out of left field. A character not previously in the story so there was no chance of predicting. Even the detectives in the story solved the murder ""by chance.""I also felt it was too short for sufficient character development."
4,keeps ya guessing,"A easy, fast read that keeps you turning pages. Many characters who could have been the culprit. You'll be surprised at the ending. :)"
4,Ax by Ed McBain,"Kindle edition of Ed McBain's ""Ax"" / online from AmazonEnjoyable easy reading. Right to the point.""Characters"" from a bygone era. Strong personalities. Not too many individualsto keep track of."
2,"Okay, might be an author I could read more of","My first book by this author. Very pseudo gritty style, kind of 1950's noir but I think the characters could be more developed. FYI to other reviewers, I only review the quality of book not the device or the formatting. Just because AMAZON doesn't distinguish between the three doesn't mean I can't."
3,Quick Read,"This was loaned to me on my Kindle by a friend. I always enjoy the police of the 87th Precinct, their lives and loves. I guess I should have expected a little goriness to the book since the title was ""Ax"" but I didn't like the way McBain described the murder, too vivid. I've enjoyed other books in this series and will continue to read them."
1,This is not what you are looking for!,I had heard an Orchestral version of Striesand songs that was soooo beautiful and went out and bought this CD by mistake...the tracks on this cd sounds like they are midi's not an orchestra at all...karoake tracks at best!The one you want is called:EVERGREEN: MUSIC FROM THE FILMS OF BARBRA STREISANDHope this helps you avoid the same mistake I made!
4,Where da Killas at?,"North Memphis! North Memphis!The days of our lives theme? Done and done!Only thing is, this is a straight down south cd. It would be hard for the north to accept it cause Pat's accent is damn thick. I'm from the north, but i hate the rap up here cept Shyne and Killa.Ghetty Green is a classic album."
5,typical three-6-mafia music!,"Ok, Project Pat, is from the Hypnotize Minds-Prophet Posse Camp, which is also Three-6-Mafia. So, if you like Three-6-mafia, Prophet Posse, Gangsta Boo, The Kaze, Indo G, & Tear Da Club Up Thugs, you'll like this too! it's hot! all the albums i just mentioned are my favorites. there is no group better than Three-6-Mafia! the label is Hypnotize Minds, & thats just what the music does! it's just wicked. go get it!"
5,THE BOMB,I LOVE YOUR SONG BALLERS AND REPRESENT IT AND NORTH MEMPHIS.I LIKE THE BEING OF YOUR VIDEO ON BALLERS BECAUSE NORTH MEMPHIS AIN;T NOTHING BUT BALLERS AND WE REPRESENT IT TO THE FULLNESS. DIG THAT
2,dang is it me?,"all i can say is ""you are no no limit"". this mess sounds wack and it got about one good song on it. all the beats sound the same and it doesn't do nutin for me."
1,More nursery rhymes in ebonics,"The only half-decent song on here is Up There because it has Krayzie Bone on it. I still like Three 6 a little, but Pat should hang it up."
4,an album that you get hype listening to,"that song ballerz i think is the fattest video out right now. Project Pat is doin his thing now, its his time to shine now. hes been in the shadow long enough. we need to see more videos with him in it though."
2,PROJECT PAT SHOULD NOT GO SOLO AGAIN !,"THIS ALBUM STINKS.THE BEATS ARE GOOD.BUT THE BAD THING IS THOUGH,PROJECT PAT SOUNDS THE SAME IN ALL THE HYPNOTIZE ALBUMS.HERES THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS 2,6,7,20.ALL AROUND DON'T BUY THIS JUNK.TRUST ME."
2,Good in theory but not in practice.,This nifty hood does do its job of shielding the LCD from light. The problem is that it must be folded down to use the viewfinder. Folding it is cumbersome since the side panels must be pushed in to fold the cover down. This makes it impractical since if you want to review a shot you must open it and then to take the next shot you have to close it.
5,Great Autobiography of a well knwn Proffessional Hunter,"Thoroughly enjoyed the life stories of Northcote, the people he met and his experiences with all of the change that has gone on in Africa through the years."
1,not for me,"I could never quite figure this one out....either the baby seemed squished up in a ball, or I was uncomfortable. Maybe I just had the wrong size."
2,I have to agree,"THe previous poster said it all. I ended up using this maybe 2 times and I had to wait till my daughter was older than a newborn due to it eating her whole as it seemed!UpdateI still cannot seem to use this with my new baby. She is uncomfortable like she is being squished. She hates it, and I do not feel comfortable wearing it. Off to sell it on ebay!"
4,Stuart Finds Friendship,"I liked Stuart's Cape because he has a big imagination. Stuart needs adventures. But, adventures are only for people who have capes, that's what he says. In this book,Stuart moves to a new place and is worried that no one will be his friend. In the end, Stuart finds many friends in his new home.Review by Dulce"
4,Stuart's Imagination,"I like Stuart's Cape because he always goes for what he wants and he has a wild imagination. I liked it because Stuart is one crazy kid. Because, who would play hide-and-go seek and have a bed made out of toast?!By Unity"
5,Stuart's Cape,"Stuart's Cape by Sara Pennypacker is a wonderful story about a very imaginative boy. He has many adventures while wearing his cape, from flying because he ate too much light and fluffy angel food cake to growing his favorite food: toast with butter. I liked this story because it showed how imaginative kids can be. It also made me think about using my own imagination. Sara Pennypacker has a great imagination if she can come up with such a funny story. I can't wait to read her next book!"
5,An Absolute Adventure,I loved Stuart's Cape. It is a great book that tells of the imaginative adventures of the main character Stuart. He goes through such adventures as sleeping on a giant bed made of toast to floating high in the sky and the only way down is to eat pound cake. The illustrations that accompany the story bring the entire book to life. This is truly a great read for anybody of any age.
5,Lexar and Amazon,"The compact flash card is perfect in every way.Even better, Amazon got it to me in less than24 hours (standard shipping option). Incredible Service!"
5,Great with my Canon Rebel,So far it has worked great. I have used it for 3 months & it has not failed yet. Tried someone else's IBM microdrive in my camera & it seemed to be slower writing to disc than this card on my Rebel.
1,NO GO WITH MINOLTA DIMAGE 7HI,"I own a Minolta Dimage 7hi. Put card in my camera and clicked an image. Erased it. There it gives me a CRAD ERROR. No further tricks worked on it. My camera just won't recognize it. Can't even format it. So Dimage 7Hi owners, BEWARE of this card. Even though the Minolta Compatibilty chart shows this card on their list, but I would still recommend everyone to be alert. However a 16MB Lexar Media 8x provided by Minolta with the camera works ok. Atleast do not buy from e-bay or any other site that does not guarantee return shipping. I finally bought a SanDisk for $49.xx from Costco and it works like a champ."
2,Died after 12 months,"Unbelievable! I lost about 20 pictures and then the card died a year after I bought it. Perhaps that is as long as they are supposed to last, but I thought I should get longer life out of the card."
4,Not Bad,"I already had a 128 MB CF card form SanDisk, but wanted a 256 MB card, since I was running out of memory on trips and photo shoots. I bought this Lexar Media CF card because of the price. I thought the 12X would translate in to higher I/O performance compared to my SanDisk card. I didn't notice any speed increase though. The card gets the job done, but it's not any thing to get excited over."
2,Lexar Faster? not for me,"I purchased a ""24 X"" Lexar 256 MB CF card for my Minolta Dimage 7 expecting that it would store large images faster than the much cheaper 256 MB CF card I already had [Delkin Devices eFilm]. I was disappointed: the Lexar card was even slower than the Delkin card. 15 Meg images take 32-33 seconds to store with the bargin CF card. The Lexar card takes 5 or 6 seconds longer.At low resolutions, there's no appreciable difference. I recommend buying the cheapest CF card that will work with your camera."
3,"Follows the book closely, but different from the Disney version","I purchased this movie since I was such a fan of Disney's ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" starring Patrick McGoohan. This ""Dr Syn"" is worth seeing, but you'll appreciate it more if you've already read the original ""Dr Syn"" book by Russell Thorndike. I was disappointed that there wasn't more action in the movie, but George Arliss does a good job as the title character, and it was interesting to see an older, cagier Dr Syn -- one at the end of his career. If you do decide to buy this edition of ""Dr Syn,"" be advised that the VHS copy I received was grainy and it can be difficult to see some scenes that take place at night. Bottom line: Buy this if you're a fan of the ""Dr Syn"" series. It's good, but I much prefer the 3 episode ""Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" that Disney made."
3,AC Delco Made in China,"I bought these rotors from Amazon as a set of used rotors. The used part is that the packaging was suppose to be in a bit of rough shape but the rotors are to be in excellent condition. I got them to save nearly $30 each and upon arrival I opened the boxes which appeared to at one time to have gotten wet, only to notice that both the blue plastic packaging on the rotors had been previously opened and there was a black shellac like material on both rotors. I sent them back for a full refund and ended up buying Wagner at more cost at first compared to the $21 cost on each AC Delco rotor that were used.The Wagner rotors and the AC Delco rotors are made in China. I was shocked to say the least. I can get a 20% discount near daily at Advance Auto Parts on there Wearever brand and not have to go through this situation. Save yourself the money and buy local and you will see that no matter where you buy or what brand you buy the rotors are made outside the shores of the US."
3,Quick Read,"Basic, would have liked a bit more. I was looking for more substance and spiritual input to this saints story."
5,the hobo Philosopher,"I had never heard of this man until I stumbled onto this book at an old and used bookstore. I have since researched this man a little in history books. He was really quite an individual and a truly heroic German. I enjoyed this book very much and learned a good deal of history in the process. He was, like Adolf, a veteran and ""hero"" of World War I, but in opposition to Adolf. He gives another side of the post World War I German epic. I know that he has written a lot more but this is his only work that I have read. I was very pleased and he was well worth my efforts."
2,promising but not quite there yet,"Led by keyboardist/vocalist Josh Pincus, who bears a startling vocal similarity to Styx's Dennis DeYoung if he was on steroids, Ice Age play fairly pedestrian art metal - not bad, but not great either. Guitarist Jimmy Pappas is a technical whiz, but not much for anything particularly soulful or original, and unfortunately his is the dominant instrument (his cover art is really cool, though). But the main deficiency is that too many of the songs go nowhere, despite their epic lengths. Not all - ""Join"" is the kind of sweeping, catchy anthem rock radio was made for, and the final epic ""To Say Goodbye"" actually works despite its excessive length. Ice Age is a talented bunch of cats - they just need to get their songwriting chops up there with their instrumental ones."
2,For the aspiring 15-year old metal guitarist in the family,What's progressive ? There are a hundred other bands doing the same thing. The music is like the cd cover (done by the band too): technically very good but it makes no sense ! Grow up and learn some real musical sensibility.
1,A meaningless exercise in unison-line playing,"Dream Theater wannabees without the creativity, brilliance or emotion of DT. The vocal melodies and chord progressions are amatuerish. It's bands like this that give the genre a bad reputation for making music with all flash and no substance. I don't know what the other reviewers heard that I didn't. Kansas ?? Styx ?? Be serious !! One star for the proficient playing and the cool album art."
5,Intense and awesome,"Definitely paramount in all aspects. The singing is usually what I find to make or break an album, and it definitely made this album. Pincus's voice is perfect for the progressive scene, and he makes it apparent on this great album. All the songs are great, and ""Sleepwalker"" and ""Miles to Go"" are especially invigorating. I recently purchased their second album ""Liberation"". Liberation puts a little more emphasis on the Lyrics and guitar, and the singing seems a bit more toned down. But its still awesome.--= Devin"
4,progressive rock up and comer,"This album is a combination of DreamTheater (DT), Styx, Yes and a few other similar bands. Songs have a tendency to be an octave higher than DT and more vocally-centric. Vocals are quite good and closely follow a Dennis DeYoung (Styx lead)tone, but would like to see them jam more on the next album. If you're a progressive rock fan who follows bands like DT you'll enjoy this album."
3,great work but less originality,"These guys are pretty good. The guitars, keyboards, drums and vocals are working full capacity. If you liked DT's Images and Words and Awake you'll like this CD too, and I have to say, if there were no Dream Theatre and no Shadow Gallery then I would say that this band is awesome. But there is DT and SG, so even there is some originality in some songs, what this band has done was done before. I think the guitarist has some of his own style but the songs in this CD reminds me those Petrucci&KevinMoore guitar+keyboard combinations, you can hear those kind of guitar keyboard work in this CD and they are not bad. Ones who are looking for complex music, strong rhythm and lead guitar accompanied with keyboard, strong drums and a really original vocal should by this CD. But don't be surprised if you hear some DT and SG.My favorite songs: Perpetual Child, Sleepwalker, Bottom Line and One Look Away. I like this CD more as I keep on listening."
3,Good bag,"We used this bag as a toy container. It worked wonderfully: roomy, easy to move from room to room, and easy to collapse. After about a a year and a half of heavy use by the kids it broke. Probably would have lasted much longer if we had actually used it as a laundry hamper."
4,Over priced,"I love bongo bags, I use mine for clothes and toy storage. I know you can find these for around $7.00 at Kmart, Target or Meijer's, so although I recommend this product highly, it's way over priced on Amazon. And as for the reviews that rate this product 4 stars on most of the bongo bags, it seems to be the same exact review on all the bags, which is obviously the seller rating their own product......item is over priced for what it is."
1,awful and debasing for women,I completely agree with Katrina Alice. This book was based on characters I really disliked. She was strong in her head and then the weakest woman around him and it was disgusting. He was an arrogant rapist who never listened. She whined about that but never did anything. Not only did I not enjoy this book but I felt debased as a woman. Very disturbing.
5,Fun Sci-fi Romance,"I love this book. This was the first Dara Joy book I have read. It's creative, witty, fun and romantic. The hero is an alpha so some readers might not like that and the story line is sci-fi. I guess for some this book won't do, but I say give it a try you might like it - I loved it! I then went on to read other Dara Joy books and among my favs. are Rejar, Mine to Take, and High Energy."
3,"It's okay, decent plot...","This was the first book I've read by this author, and I was expecting more due to the great reviews. I think the book suffered a little just from having such high expectations. It's an okay book - the plot idea was good, but it had very little tension (both romantic tension and dramatic tension), and the steam scenes were bland. The characterization was pretty good - I cared about the characters and read to the end to find out what would happen, so that was a plus. Overall, I'd say this is a good start to the series, but I hope future books ramp up on the tension to make them un-put-down-able. :)"
5,A must have in your futuristic collection!,"Is to die for! I just love it, is funny and so very very sexy. I like the way the characters interacted with each other, there was a feeling of connection. The only question I have is "" Why did Lorgan have to give some of his power to Deanna, and when is he going to get it back? there was some unresolve issues with Deanna's power as well, but overall the book is lovely. Highly recomended! When are we getting Traed story?"
2,"All in all, a disappointment.","I had high hopes for KNIGHT...especially after reading HIGH ENERGY, a book I thoroughly enjoyed, with well-rounded characters and an interesting storyline. But KNIGHT... could never quite capture my attention. I had no idea what the hero and heroine saw in each other. Both characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. I never quite cared about the so-called quest they were on and frankly would have stopped reading it if it wasn't for the appearance of the supporting characters of Yaniff (who surely was Merlin in another dimension!) and the irresistable (or should I say insatiable?) Rejar.I can't reccommend this book, but I will say that having had a glimpse of Rejar, I am looking forward to reading about him and the woman who finnally tames him in the next book."
2,Not for those who think that women are as capable as men,"Based on the reviews I found here I bought this book, and several others in the series. I was dismayed to realize that the hero never demonstrates any empathy for the heroine - he gets her into some terrible messes and seems to think it's his right to haul her along behind him like a child's toy. Many romances feature men with less than enlightened attitudes towards women, but they are usually redeemed by the hero's realization that the woman in question has many good qualities and isn't really an inferior. In this case, the misogynism/chauvinism never ends. If you find that you don't like books where the woman has absolutely no control over her own life and is treated like a mindless child, then I wouldn't recommend you read this one."
3,Didn't expect this,"This book had some truly horrible parts in it. she was man handled and this Hero was so sure that he knew what best for her and there for disregarded her feelings. SOME sweet moments, but they were few and far between!"
5,This is the one that started us to reading Dara Joy,"Meet Lorgin and Deanna. She's having more than a bad hair day. It could be worse, like meeting an alien. Hey, she's a sci-fi buff like everyone else. Enter Lorgin. Its instant and it works. Her characters make you want more. Lorgin's brother, Rejar. The sensous feline. His Mentor, Yaniff. Wacky/Omnipotent.And Traed. An enigma worth a second, and third look. Lorgin and Adeann as Lorgin calls her, is the start of a wonderful series. Each connected and fascinating. The fire between the lovers is funny, sometimes touching, and the romance HOT."
4,Joy has seriously done it this time!,"This is the most touching, complex, wonderful story that I have ever seen Dara Joy produce. Not even Rejar, in my opinion, is as good as this book. Well, uhh... I'm biased because Traed is more fully developed in this book than in any other Aviaran-type Dara Joy book, and he's my favorite character... but trust me, this book will have you laughing, crying, and wishing with a fervency that you didn't know you had that Aviarans and Familiars were real."
3,"Didn't surpass the experience of her ""Tonight or Never""","Fabulous, but nowhere near as stunningly sensual as Joy's ""Tonight or Never"". The male characters were wonderfully portrayed and Deana *did* have her moments but there was an atmosphere missing when I pictured her in my mind. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable reading and I can't wait to find the next one ""Rejar"" to get my mind into."
2,Puuuhhleeeese!,"Okay, it was not THAT bad.Alright, it was kinda bad.The book did start off quite well. I thought it was hilarious in the first few chapters. But that was all. The rest of the book became quite boring, filled with endless unnecessary sex scenes. I'm okay with sex scenes in romance novels. There's gotta be some, right? Well, in this book it was kind of overdone. I also don't think that the author has given enough consideration when creating the female lead character. She had no control of herself whatsoever when it came to Lorgin (the main guy). I think it was pathetic. She was also unbelievably dumb. Even male authors would have given their female characters more credit that that. You can drool over a guy or fantasize about him, but you don't have lose all your dignity and senses over the sight of his bare [rear end].Enough said. ..."
2,Good For Only a Few Chapters,"The book started off reminding me of chick lite with all the humor. I laughed out loud a number of times, certain I would love the book. The hero was goofy even corny. But what made him so likable was the ""fish out of water"" concept, him being an alien on Earth and experiencing everything for the first time--with humorous results!However--once he takes her back to his universe, the vague, generic sci-fi plot sucks the life out of the book. A magic stone in a necklace that can alter the universe? Not very original. Too make it worse, the author keeps most of the plot details secret for too long. Almost the entire book is spent traveling from point A to point B. Sorry, but traveling is not plot. The internal conflict was a little weak. The hero really had no internal conflict. He was already in marriage bliss early on.I think the book would have been so much better if the author kept it on Earth."
5,A journey to another world that is well worth the price,"This book came when I was ready for another world -- even the past did not seem far enough away. The book provides a trip to a world that I would want to return to again when this one becomes a bit too stressful; the hero is handsome, overbearing in a tolerable way, and totally devoted to the heroine --- as all good romantic heroes should be. The path to love doesn't run smoothly, but it does run entertainingly. Poor Deana finds herself married without her knowledge or consent, told that she has powers she does not recognize or understand, and still manages to triumph. I have since waited in greatest anticipation for anything else Ms. Joy can manage to write. I have not been disappointed. She takes the tried and true of this world and creates a world of her own in more ways than one. Even my friends who are not into futuristic romance have enjoyed this one"
4,Very entertaining!!!,"I love a fast paced book & this one definitely delivered. I've never been much on futuristic romance, but this one really kept me entertained. Only once in a while do I find a 'hero' that makes me drool like Lorgin did :) (although I expect Regar to be right up there with Lorgin!) I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I did have a bit of a problem with Deana. More than once I really wanted to tell her ""Knock him in the head & make him listen to you!!!!"" She really did give in much, much too easily on a few things that she should have put her foot down & at least made him explain things or compromise. I did not find the humor 'laugh out loud' like a lot of people (well, EXCEPT the morning after the Transference! Know THAT was laugh out loud funny!), but I did smile & chuckle quite a bit thru out. I will definitely being reading Rejar's story. Thanks, Ms. Joy, for a very entertaining read."
5,I liked it,"I liked this book. It was different and if it is like Star Track, more power to the author because I never cared for those movies. It is an interesting adventure that's for sure. The different worlds the author creates and the alien life forms. I liked the journey that we were brought on. Ya, Deana was a dunce at times, but I thought overall she made a good character. Lorgin too. The book is about his magical journey. The whole book is the magical quest, an FYI to those who missed that. It is him in the tunnel, when he came out and why. The stone and everything after that. Those who read the book will know what I mean. Because what would have happened if the stone was in the wrong hands? The sex scenes sizzle. I would reccomend this book. It is a fun adventure to new places and all kinds of ""people"""
1,"I hate you, Lorgin ta'al Krue.","I didn't find this book the least bit romantic, which is unfortunate, because the sci-fi elements are very weak and unoriginal. The ""hero,"" Lorgin, is an unlikeable, overbearing jerk with no respect for the ""heroine,"" Deanna (rightfully, I suppose, because she's none too bright). I like cheesey sci-fi (""Earth Girls are Easy"" used to be one of my favorite movies), and I can stomach a lot of unlikely actions in the name of some laughs - but there were almost none to be had, here. The vast majority of the humor wasn't funny at all, and the parts that were, were brief and infrequent. I did not enjoy this book."
1,A terrible book - as told for the 3RD TIME,"The first three chapters of this book are great. Stop reading it after that, because it's not worth it. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I won't say anything more than that, because Amazon won't let me without pulling my review (AGAIN)."
4,Great Fantasy by Dara Joy,"Not knowing this was a series, I read ""Rejar"" first. ""Rejar"", for me, was the best book of the series. Stars was next and Mine to Take last. Stars however, is very good. The story is interesting and the romance hot! If you can be a little patient with the main character (he is a little overbearing) it is a very enjoyable read. I highly recomment the entire series for ""get away"" reading! Have fun!"
3,Ending?,"While I like the descriptions of the characters and the plot of the novel, I was very disappointed by the ending. I understand that this is the first in a series, but I was so turned off by the lack of a real ending, that I refuse to buy any more of the books in the trilogy. Without a real ending, this book cannot stand alone and it doesn't. There are so many pieces missing in this novel, presumably answered in the next so as to make it incomplete."
4,Mostly fun to read,"Deana and Lorgan story was mostly fun to read. I'm waiting for Tread's story. I had one major problem with the story: whenever a woman said ""NO!"" that means ""NO!"". Lorgan used sex to get whatever he wants from Deana, instead of talking to her. He assumed he knows better what's good for her and what she wants. Well, I have got news for you Mrs. Joy: A woman knows what she wants, when she wants it and how she wants it. And when she say ""STOP"", that means she wants him to stop, even if her body tells another story."
1,ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!,"Ridiculous, kitsch, a complete waste of time. The heroine is stupid beyond belief, the book's storyline heavily underestimates the reader's intelligence, and the prose is close to illiterate, not to mention the novel's pathetic dialogue. An exercise in bad taste.Anyone who dresses like Lorgin should be in jail.All in all, extremely trashy. My first and last attempt to read a Dara Joy novel."
3,Okay Book,"This book is okay. The plot is good, but the characters are weak and sterotyped. The heroine desperately needs some backbone. This is a one-read book."
3,"can be annoying, but still fairly good","I've read this book a few times and, depending on my mood at the time, either liked it or was annoyed by it. This book doesn't have the feel that a lot of supposedly futuristic romances have, that the only thing that makes them different from uncivilized barbarian hero stories is that they're set on a different planet. The fantasy elements are actually important to the story, although the author doesn't do as much with them as she should. The annoying part of this book is the way the main characters act. Lorgin seems determined to make sure that nothing touches Deana's life unless he allows it (at one point he tells her she can't see one of her male friends again). Deana does fight him over this occaisionally, but she always crumbles 'cause he's so big and handsome. She needed to learn to take charge. The most interesting character in this book is Rejar, who seems much more charming than Lorgin."
1,Knight of a Billion Yawns,"This book is boring. Most of it is spent wandering around in tunnels while the non-existing romantic tension is supposed to be building between the main characters. The hero - obnoxious in a ""I'll save the day"" sort of way - knows everything and yet won't let his heroine in on the secret. She takes forever to figure things out. You like spunky, smart, funny heroines? Try Jennifer Cruisie instead."
5,Knight Of A Trillion Stars,"This was a most excellent book. I enjoyed it from cover to cover, not able to put it down for a moment. If you love romance, humor, and a little action, then this book is definately for you!!! This is the best romance novel I have ever written in my entire life."
5,DARA JOY IS THE BEST!,"Deana is the lucky woman in this story. Lorgin finds Deana and wisks her back to his world. The passion stiring between these two are HOT,HOT,HOT, so are the love scenes!! Rejar and Yaniff appear in this book. Rejar is playfull and full of mischief! You find yourself laughing at the exchanges between Rajar, Yaniff and Lorgin. This book was great.."
4,More than just a romance novel!,I was very pleasantly surprised. This was my 3rd Dara Joy book. HIGH ENERGY and HIGH INTENSITY being the first two. This was by far the best one yet. The story line is much more complex. I am excited to read more about the supporting characters in upcoming books.
3,BBQ NUBE,"Shipment received quickly and in good condition.Disappointed in book. It has lots of history / gossip about Texas bbq'ers and not many recipes / info for bbq'ing. Many of the recipes tell you to use ""your favorite rub / marinade / mop / bbq sauce"". Not any help for a nube like me.So if you want to catch up on your Texas bbq'ers this is your book. If you want to take advantage of seasoned bbq'ers experince to help you with your bbq game this is not your book. This will be going to the second hand book store soon."
4,Intriguing and well written story of sexual discovery,"Well-acted and intelligently written film depicting the sexual explorations of two complex and compelling characters. Obviously, this film isn't for the under-18 crowd, but for adults who are interesting in observing the travails of two lovers embroiled in steamy but realistic romantic discovery, this film is good place to start."
3,Good Overview but Makes it Sound Too Good to Be True,"The book does a good job at providing a very basic introductionto land development. However, it does not sufficiently address several key elements:1. The importance of due diligence. Before purchasing property, one should conduct due diligence to ensure that there won't be environmental issues, wetlands issues, indian burial grounds, endangered species, protected plant life (trees, etc), protected wildlife, etc. Any one of these could severely limit the future use of the land. This book does not emphasize this enough.2. The potential difficulties in finding buyers for subdivided land. Just because you buy it and subdivide it doesn't mean that there are buyers out there ready to buy the subdivided land from you.In summary, this book provides a good basic overview, but that's all. I wouldn't go out and purchase land solely based on what's stated in this book."
1,a poor choice for land subdivision,"Though the author writes in a very readable style, the content leaves much to be desired. The author paints too broad a picture when describing the process. In doing so, it is impossible for the reader to learn any true specifics that would actually be used to make a deal. As a developer myself, I like to see more substance when any discussion of real estate takes place. This book reads more like a ""get rich quick scheme"" than a ""how to"" book."
3,80's Metal Band,"Growing up in the Metal laced eighties was a fun time...I had heard of this band and me, being a LOTR fan. I just had to go check out their music or a show--I really never did like them much but, they had a cool name and the album covers were really cool too.I do remember seeing a lot of heavy metal bands--even if, I was in cloud of illegal smoke. I would either like the band or not--Cirith Ungol was one of those typical 80's metal bands.There must have been dozens of no name bands back then-and most of them where forgetable.I always thought Cirith Ungol reminded me of a Judas Priest rip off--with a really good metal name.I give them three stars---not because of the music but, they bring me back to a very fun time in my life."
5,"If you liked DLG, you will like this CD","If were a fan of the recently broken Dark Latin Groove (better known as DLG) group, this CD will be to your liking. Mikey Perfecto is one of the two members of 3-2 Get Funky, and shows his salsa/reggae style on every track. His ability to switch from a smooth salsa voice to a reggae lyrics will win you over. The music is mostly salsa beats with a reggae influence, and the lyrics have much more of an urban flavor."
5,The Servant,"Written by Harold Pinter, Losey's ""The Servant"" is a psychosexual allegory of power, exploitation, and class resentment that belongs, in its unique way, to the ""angry young man"" school of British film. Bogarde was hailed (justifiably) for his sinister turn as Hugo, while Fox easily inhabits Tony, the impotent, manipulated aristocrat. One of the best films of the sixties, and among the best British films ever, ""The Servant"" is vintage Pinter, and a first-rate showcase for the gifted, under-appreciated Bogarde."
2,Service Unbecoming,"This film starts off promising enough but degenerates into innuendo and utter confusion. What is the real relationship between the servant and ""sister""? (I've never seen the appeal of Sarah Miles who looks a lot like Daisy Duck.) The film implies a homosexual relationship between master and servant especially when the camera peeks into the servant's quarters exposing male physique pictures plastered on the wall above the bed. Later the two men are seen horsing around like a couple of gay playmates. Even the old woman with the big hat in the orgy(?) scene looks like a drag queen. I like Dirk much more in ""Victim"" which costs an arm and a leg on Amazon. The only thing I liked about this film is the snobby horseface girlfriend being humiliated and dumped. ""The Servant"" is basically dishonest in the old Hollywood fashion."
1,Not good for moderately heavy purchases,"I bought this - more expensive - cart after my $20 cheap one fell apart on my way home last week. The cart was reasonably easy to put together, and when empty, it works well.But, when you put things in it - even moderately heavy loads - the front wheels lock up, and because of the propensity of the wheels to roll under the cart, the cart becomes unbalanced from the front, and wants to fall over towards the front all the time.I got this cart because I carry water and soda about half a mile home after supermarketing. These are very typical loads.Don't believe it when it says it can carry 200lb - rolling on a smooth surface maybe - at a push.However, if you want to use this cart to carry loads home - on pavement and walking across roads - this cart fails miserably.The last time I used it, I literally had to drag it behind me because of its propensity to topple over at the front.My advice - DON'T BUY THIS CART."
1,DON'T BUY!,I bought this cart because of the swivel wheels...So far they have fallen off 3 or 4 times in the parking lot. When this happens it's almost impossiable to move...The back wheels splay out so that they are never really on the ground. All together this is a piece of JUNK! And if there was a Zero star I would have given it that.
3,Only for collectors.,"This CD not satisfy the sound expectations. The scores created for great orchestra lose melodic quality on having transfered them to piano solos. But it is a sonorous unique document. Bronislau Kaper was a great pianist before being a composer. To have a sample of his talent in CD, supposes a wonderful event for the performers collecting of piano or the soundtracks collecting composers."
3,Sad to watch...,"It was sad to watch the end of an era happen due to stupid people and the drugs they brought into the sean... THis was not a hippie problem, it was people who come just for the drugs and caused the end of an era... This movie shows the kind of people that, in the end brought the Dead to an end!"
2,Wasted Time,"If you value your time, don't waste it on this video. Too much fill and fluff, not enough music. There are many music videos available that are much better."
5,The Host is absolutely darling!,"The previous 2 reviewers have already given much valuable information on this video. I would like to add that Helen Corey is absolutely charming and looks like she's having so much fun in the kitchen. I have a favorite Lebanese restaurant that I drive over 100 miles to visit, and always wanted to know how to make that fabulous food, but everything looked so complicated. I love to cook, but I don't like to spend hours in the kitchen. Helen Corey makes each of these recipes look quite simple. I felt much less intimidated by my cookbook recipes after being able to literally see her going through the steps of each recipe. It was like being in the kitchen with a friend and seeing each new recipe from start to finish. This is a wonderful video."
1,JUST A TAPE--NO HARDCOVER!!,"Please be aware this is merely a VHS product. There is no book (hardcover) as stated in the advertisement. What a disappointment. I ordered this to just get the book (hardcover) as I have no VHS player but was willing to order this item since it appeared, at least to me, that a hardcover book was, also, included. Nooooooooo hardcover was included or meant to be included. I don't know why it shows [hardcover] on the sales page, but it does. Just be aware that this is for the sale of a VHS only. Amazon gave me credit for this purchase since I had no use for it and the advertisement of the item was misleading."
2,well....,"I really like avril, but... sometimes, I get sick, she is so superficial! I really recommend this cd (I dont have it yet, but i have listened the songs and they`re great)... I can say, I dont like her, i like her songs... PS: do ya noticed she almoust repeat the same thing on the songs? she wants to say every time what she say on dont tell me.... ah, do ya ever listened the song basket case? I never, but I read the letter ho somebody give to me sayng that is from her, but i`m not sure... the letter is really weard..."

4,Please Don`t Tell Me,Avril Lavigne is so HOT HOT HOT i mean on fire her voice is awsome she is great.
5,A fantastic book!,As a native of this section of Florida I found this story just fascinating. We've had so many tales of drug running over the years so this story probably has a great deal of truth in it and is not just fiction. My husband and I have sailed extensively and can attest that boats do approach in the night flashing signal lights in order to transfer drugs. Mr. Rudloe has written a book that I didn't want to put down. It is a thriller and would make a fantastic movie. I highly recommend it!
1,Where's the information?,"Like what did I learn by clicking on the product detail? Did I learn which music might be played, which square dances might be on the thing? Guess whoever wrote this might be short on vocabulary or perhaps have too much other work."
1,Awful,It is simply embarrassing to see a once excellent actor like George Peppard making a fool of himself in a production like this. It is not a movie. It is some awful made for TV venture and everyone involved is just trying to make a buck. Personally I could not watch it until the end. Higgins is not a great writer but he is perfect for an airport waiting lounge. This production destroys his book.
4,One person making a difference,"My mother, Elaine Kuper, and I enjoyed the book from our different perspectives---hers, from her active involvement at Beth Israel having taught Sunday School for 25 years (and my grandmother, Lorraine Hofeller having taught for 40 years!) My family's membership of Temple Beth Israel goes back to 1934--My interest focused on the amazing history of Texas politics! This book truly underscores the fact that one person can make a difference!"
4,Yoakum's loss,"Yoakum's loss was our gain. This is an exceedingly well-written memoir of a remarkable life. It is the rare memorist who can not only tell her story, but make the reader feel he is right there along with her. I'm ready for her next chapters."
4,Will likely be the shoe I wear the most.,"The leather on this shoe looked quite nice for the money paid as it had some grain to to it. It fit around my ankles just as a propely made shoe should fit. But this is pretty much a ' goin' to the supermaket ' shoe and little else. Perhaps a waiters shoe. This is my first pair of Deer Stags and all I can tell you is they were around in the '60's, so they still might know a thing or two about shoemaking."
5,Action with an RPG Flair,"Restricted Area reminds me of Diablo meets Bladerunner.The gameplay is very fast and fun and there havent been many decent RPG's in a while. The dark futuristic theme reminds me of Blade Runner, with a mix of the Fallout series and the graphics and gameplay are much like Diablo 2 one of my favorite games of all time. It's got Guns and roleplay and stats and levels, and all kids of terrain to explore and items to play with.I would highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a fast paced,action oreinted RPG !"
5,Pure Worship,This Cd is very peaceful for a worshipperin Christ. Its not the same style as the stuffhas on the radio. This Cd is very soulful and contemporarybut now overproduced with fast beats that drownout the message. With the use of the use of liveinstruments this album seems pure and genuine.The anointing is here and everything is inspiredby the Holy Ghost. If you are into a lot of rhythmsand beats this Cd may not be for you. Also if you are lookingfor entertainment this Cd is not for. This Cdis more designed for worship and meditation.For mature christians definitely!
4,A Wonderful testimony to God's Glory,This is such a delightful collection of praise to our Heavenly Father. Deitrick sings from his heart and wants to get across to us his love for the Lord. This is enjoyable to both young and old. I do believe he has made his mark. Keep praising the Lord and telling your story!
3,Disappointing,"Very little psychic ability--a lot of regular amateur gumshoe. The writing is good and with a little more of what the jacket promised, it would have been a more exciting read. Reggie is funny and smart as are most of her friends, especially Stark. Her friend Devaney, the cop, is very well drawn, but is pretty much useless in the book. After asking for her psychic help, he waves off any and all clues she gets and refuses to help her do what he asked her to do in the first place. The plot and mystery are convoluted and almost totally devoid of any psychic solving. Reggie bounces from clue to clue given to her by a multitude of characters who are placed like pin-ball cushions throughout the book."
3,Mixed review,"I enjoyed the main character and her psychic ability. However, the book's pace was a little slow for me. A little too much of her going to talk to someone and chit-chatting about irrelevant stuff and then finding one tiny piece of information. It was as if all you had to do was read the last page of every chapter. But it was well-written."
4,at the mercy of ESP,"Rebeccasreads recommends NOW YOU SEE HER as an entertaining evening's mystery, replete with believable people, layers of latent evil, & some devious characters all involved in an old murder, street drugs, illegal industrial waste disposal, rotten politicians, ranting street preachers, & a man sentenced to life who is still, after thirteen years, insisting he's innocent.Reggie Cutter sets out to find out if this is so, helped along by visitations of physical paranormal manifestations, a sinister biker, & a reluctant police detective."
2,not my type,"Another psychic mystery - Reggie Cutter is starting her life over in the Boston house that she inherited from her aunt - another psychic. Reggie is new to her abilities - but she still tries to assist police detective Frank Devaney the way her aunt had before she died. Reggie gets strange vibes in areas where there was a fire and murder 13 years ago - but she doesn't understand her skills well enough to apply them to the clues she's getting. I wasn't able to finish this story - I didn't enjoy the way the author wove the story together and many of the actions Reggie took were extremely unrealistic. This just wasn't a story for me, but I hope that others enjoy it."
1,Remove the other Review,The other guy who wrote a review here was mistaken indeed. This is not the Christian Metal band Deliverance but another band entirely that is like a soul band. Please do not allow people to review things they haven't heard....
2,Not the place to start,"If you're interested in checking out BoS, this isn't a good place to start. The songs on this album are rather rambling and have the feel of people just noodling around in the studio.Unless you are already a fan and have an idea of what you're getting yourself into (or you *really* like the infinite end track on Imaginary Friend by Th' Faith Healers), I recommend beginning with Love Agenda or maybe the Peel Sessions. The songs are more concise and a lot more interesting."
2,Wrong title,"I bought this book thinking it would have Healthy MUFFIN Recipes. I found there were only a portion of muffin recipes; instead, there were Scones, Pancakes & Breads recipes.I was quite disappointed."
5,excellent oil,"I love this product! I use it to oil my hair the night before washing and a tiny amount daily for a head massage to promote hair growth. since using, my hair has increased thickness and body! I definitely have more hair growth! I will definitely purchase again as this is now a staple in my hair regiment! I labeled this oil as one of my top 5 hair oils on my blog. [...]. its up there with some of the best in my book!"
1,*** Gross Oil !! ***,"This oil is gross! It is nothing like the other Brahmi oils on Amazon. It was pasty and foul smelling. In fact I think it was spoiled because of old stock. If you like Brahmi Oil, go with some other brand cause this one seems to be a ""fake"" and does not work as good. I am african american and use a ton of different oils for my hair. Just my thoughts.... :)"
5,West With the Night,"Being born in South Africa, this book really ""sang"" to me. Having just re-read it, I realized how lyrically Beryl wrote and her detailing and the telling of it is magnificent. She makes you feel as though you are there, in her skin. My emotions ran away with me as I read and at parts found myself in tears. Anyone who has not been to Africa should read this book as it will transport you to that wonderful land. Beryl gives you a sense of time and place and what she went through growing up in Africa."
5,I've been screwed,"I bought two copies. They were mailed in one package. But I was charged twice for handling and shipping. When I protested, the seller said he was required to charge twice by his contracts with vendors. That makes no sense. And it is a screwing of Amazon customers. If I had purchased 10 copies and they were mailed in one package, I presume I would have been charged 10 X $3.67, or whatever the shipping and handling charge is. Not fair. Not honestRobert Schmidt"
5,The book will transport you.,"If you are planning a road trip, get the audiocassette (maybe your public library has it) or have the car's passenger read aloud. Beryl is remembering the story of her life, and it is a story meant to be TOLD. Wonderfully evocative description; very absorbing story"
4,How I found this ...,"I am not quite sure how I happened upon this book but i am glad I did. The writing is a beautiful portrait of Kenya in the early 20th centure. Written from the view of English settlers, Beryl Markham was quite a character. Rumor has it that she may not have penned the book herself. I would like to learn more."
4,West With the Night,"An excellent book!Ernest Hemingway wrote, ""She writes rings around us!"" and he wasn't just being nice!A good story, well written; what more could you ask for?!"
5,West With The Night,"I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a beautifully written book that captures a period in time and place really well. I purchased this copy for my grand dsughter and I have not received any feedback from her yet. If you like books about Africa, and early aviation you will enjoy this book."
5,A terrific read!,"FABULOUS! This book sticks with you. I read it years ago and am about to read it again. Although the subject matter is not gender or age specific, I have purchased this book as a gift for many young women to get them excited about reading."
5,An extraordinary book by an extraordinary woman.,"Robert Deburgh's reviewJan 24, 12 editRead from January 18 to 23, 2012West With the Night is an extraordinary book written by an extraorinary woman. Beryl Markham grew up on a farm in Kenya and was familiar from a young age with the lifestyle, animals and indigenous population of West Africa. Her lyrical style of writing brings events, people, and the land into sharp focus for the reader. Her hunting and thoroughbred training episodes transport the reader through space and time to the Africa of the 1920s and 30s. Markham was also a pilot, flying mail, charters, and game spotting over the most unknown territory in the world at that time. Her crowning accomplishment was the first east-west solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by a woman pilot. This is a wonderful book to be enjoyed by anyone who likes adventure, airplanes, horses, or Africa. I was fascinated by it."
4,Well written reference,"Although I consider this book to one of the bestreads around, I found it more valuable as a crossreference with ""out of africa"" by Isak Dinesanand ""The flame trees of Thika"" by Elspeth Huxley.All three books write about the same district andpeople with different perspectives. Keep in my mind that Beryl's book was ghost written, and arival of Dinesen. (from what I have read)"
4,West With the Night -- Pure Delight,"This is a wonderful read. I read it a chapter a night and had plenty to consider. It tells of a brave girl, a mysterious and changing Africa, relationships with unforgettable ""characters"" and shows a regard for nature at its finest. It is amazing to find what this young girl experienced in one lifetime. As an added bonus, the writing is pure art."
5,West With the Night is a MUST READ,"If you admire the artistic ability to put words together beautifully, you must read this book. And if you ever wanted to know what Africa was like in the 20s and 30s, you must read this book!"
5,"Inspiring, Amazing","Beautifully written. Her amazing story is told in a way that makes you feel like you're sitting around over after dinner drinks, except with lions, elephants and aviation."
4,Beautiful detailed descriptions of Africa,"I had never heard of Beryl Markham, but she was an very accomplished pilot in Africa before air travel and women pilots were very common. Her descriptions of the wildlife that she sees are fascinating. Our book club read it and all members loved it. We all have two unanswered questions. Where was her mother and her husbands? They were pictured in the book, but no mention of them in the story."
5,Another Out of Africa,"This book reminded me very much of Karen Blixen's ""Out of Africa"" and only partly because of the similar subject matter. Writing with such vivid word pictures and obvious regard for the places and people of Africa, Markham and Blixen were contemporaries in British East Africa during the first part of the twentieth century. Both books tell something of the character and exploits of Dennis Finch-Hatton and Bror Von-Blixen, two famous white hunters. Both describe their relationship with African friends and employees. Markham's book ends with her solo flight from England west across the Atlantic to Canada, one of the earliest such flights by man or woman. Highly recommended."
5,My Favorite Book Ever,It's been about 25 years since I first read this wonderful book. I've read it many times since and give it as a hostess gift often.
5,"Wonderful Life, Well Told","I read this book when it first came out in the early 80s and have never forgotten it. I love Beryl Markham's language; and the story she has to tell is better than any fiction. She was an independent spirit, living an amazing life in an immense and beautiful land."
5,Loved the prose,I read this book for book club. I loved the story and the prose. I felt empowered as a woman after reading this.
4,Africa,"I bought this for my wife but after reading the review and praises of E.Hemingway I had to read it. If it had not have been for some of the reviews I read on Amazon I might have gave this book 5 stars because it reads as smooth as a Louis Lamour western. The author paints pictures with words in every chapter. The removal of the star is for the missing parts of her story, her mother, her husband, her romances, and the possibilty that someone elese wrote it."
3,WEST WITH THE NIGHT,"Despite the exquisite prose, I was disappointed with this book.The ""adventure aspect"" was lacking for me.The content was more autobiographical than expected."
3,West with the Night,"It was a very old book, and written just to show the love that every person has, who has ever been in Africa. I prefer Wilbur Smith."
3,Good reading for a young person,"I read this book as an adult, but I wish I had read it as an adolescent (girl). Beryl Markham is a fascinating figure, but I felt kind of silly reading the book because it did seem like something geared to young people. Markham's writing contains some passages of patronizing racism, but overall a surprisingly little amount considering the time and history of colonialism in Africa. I think it would be a good read for a young teen and would hopefully open his or her eyes to the complications and complexities of colonialism and the perpetually surprising way in which you can be true to yourself by shaping an unconventional life."
3,book,"Book was a bit damaged by sun and warped. Acceptable. I don't remember how it was advertised. Thanks, Charles Schwartz"
2,I strongly disliked this book.,"The book had events of great interest, however, Beryl did not express other aspects of her life that a reader might want to know. She never mentioned anything about her mother, who was she, etc. Also, although her life was interesting, I began to loose interest and the book became quite tedious to read at times. In addition to this, I found several points about her life that were confusing and seemingly contradictory. I have read many autobiographies that are better than this."
2,Not as good as I thought.,"Although I have to admit, the descriptions of her whereabouts were awfully good, most of the book lead to be tedious. The cast of characters were quite hard to keep straight,which caused it to be a bit confusing. Where did the story line go? In the beginning of the book, it began with aviation, and all of a sudden, ended up talking about zebras and warthogs??? I have to admit once again that the descriptions were marvalous, but I'd like the book to be a lot more organized and easier to keep up with."
3,Overrated and then some,"This is a pleasant book and well written. It tells the story of female aviator in Africa, and the tone is cultured and somewhat reserved. The silly gushings this book has inspired sound more like the chantings of a cult than real reviews. I think this book sneaks up on folks as it was written by a woman, an aviator, not known to be a writer. Had it been written by a man, and a known writer, it would produce more level headed, less fevered, reviewing."
1,it was bad,the book was bad because it was very hard to understand what her thoughts were and what was actually going on in the book
2,John Lennon,This book was not what I had expected. My fault for not having read more about it.The poems are out there a little further then I care to go anymore.If you enjoy this off the wall poetry then you might be able to get into it. I wasn't.Not for me at all.
3,"Off the wall, but lots of fun","Crazy ideas spinning all over the place , with Lennons ownsketches giving a remarkable yet hazy insight into a verycomplex character"
4,Great insight into Lennon,"Anyone who would like to learn more about Lennon in his own words should read this book. Very well researched. It was interesting to read this after reading THE CARPET FROGS by Alan Arlt, the best book of fiction on Lennon I've read."
2,Boring,"If you want to learn more about the ""wild"" side, you will be disappointed. Not too many tales told. Not a lot of content. Sadly boring. For serious fans only."
5,A (very) Far Out Book,"Quite a fascinating read! I couldn't put it down after reading the first story! John's ""language"" is quite amusing and the pictures are a blast to look at! I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes off-the-wall entertainment!"
1,Quite abstract and random stuff,"Its all random and abstract things.Frankly, I didn't understand much in this book."
2,Whaaaah?,What is this book?? It is nothing more than a guy that had the means to put out a book of crazy nonesence. The only good part of the book is the intro by paul. I really cant follow these stories/poems at all.Just thought id round out the bottom end of the ratings!
2,Can't figure it out,"I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son. I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable. He usually cries when he is in it. He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted. It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way. And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling. Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline."
2,Lucky-baby.com,Rather than this sling... I recommend you check out [...] for your sling. They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors. This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier.
4,great at 6 months! not for newborn.,"When my baby was a newborn, I felt I didn't have enough control to safely carry her in this sling. It just seemed uncomfortable for her head - it's not like the picture of the (very THIN!?) woman with newborn - they must have proped the baby's head up to take that picture. I felt like she was getting lost in the folds. HOWEVER, now she's 6 months and I can wear her on my hip. The New Native sling is awesome - it's simple, the material is very nice and soft, I can take it on and off easily and most important - she is totally comfy, secure and entertained, watching my every move!"
2,better slings out there,This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddler
5,Love it!,This sling is fantastic! I started using it when my daughter was about 10lbs. Her previous sling was padded by the edges started to smush her head. The New Native website has a lot of videos to show you how to put the sling on - at first it does feel strange. I also needed a blanket underneath my daughter. They are in a curved position in the sling. To prevent their face from being covered - you need to fold it at the shoulder. If your back hurts with it - you are probably wearing the wrong size. It makes such a difference to try it on with baby because if it's too low it will be extremely uncomfortable. My daughter is now 9 months old and I am going to start trying the new ways to carry her. This is a must buy!
4,Brutal and tight,"Unfortunately there are few time changes and the vocals, sound awesome, but are very repetitive, nothing catchy. I know many disagree but I thought Blachowicz was the best vocalist in Malevolent Creation.Hats off to Dave Culross..."
2,Disappointing,"First off, I like Malevolent Creation. Envenomed was very good. But to be honest, there's no post-Hoffman material worth listening to. Yeah, there's an image of a tank on the cover and it's heavy and br00tal and anyone who doesn't like it is a mallgoth poser [or whatever], but this album is simply boring. Kyle Symons proves to be one of death metal's most uncharismatic vocalists album after album, and more importantly, the band's sense of creativity and life has seemingly departed. It's easy to string together some chugging palm-muted guitar licks and call yourself death metal, but if those riffs can't serve a higher artistic purpose, it's a lost cause. I gave this album multiple chances, and whenever I hear it, I just hear one-dimensional, generic death metal. Even the awesome Dave Culross couldn't save this one."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was very disappointed with this product. As others have stated, most of the loops are sounds you probably wouldn't even use in the first place. Apples jam packs have much better loops. If your looking for some good loops I would look elsewhere."
5,Adoption and Murder,"Abby Rose is a PI specializing in adoption. She's also a Texas heiress.Will Knight hires her to find his birth family. He's now a superstar college athlete, but once he was a baby abandoned on a doorstep.There aren't many clues to his background, just an expensive baby blanket and Verna Mae, the woman who found him.Abby meets with Verna Mae. She feels she knows more than she is telling. But before they can meet again, Verna Mae is murdered.Abby is determined to find the truth. She follows the clues from the Huntsville state prison to the richest parts of Houston. Someone feels she's asking too many questions. Can she discover the truth without being silenced?I really like Abby Rose. She is such a fun and likeable character. She is well written. This is a quick and enjoyable cozy to read! The Texas setting really lends itself to the story, and I highly recommend this book.Please check out www.mysteryloverscorner.com"
3,enjoyable,"I really like this series. Its not rocket science, but the characters are amusing and the plotline usually keeps me guessing. I find it a pleasant, easy, enjoyable read. Some mystery, some comedy and some romance...but not so much that there's ""breasts heaving"" or ""loins aching with desire"". If you want that, check elsewhere."
1,She hated it!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bought this for my mom. Was hoping she would enjoy it... since there are other books by this author in this series. She politely asked me to NEVER buy another one of that authors books.
4,Tull In The Gallery,"1975's ""Minstrel In The Gallery"" finds Jethro Tull going for a more acoustic-rock sound, and, with several tracks featuring Tull leader Ian Anderson by himself, the album at times sounds more like an Anderson solo project than a group project. Still, ""Minstrel In The Gallery"" is a very strong Tull album. The first three cuts---the title song, ""Cold Wind To Valhalla"" and ""Black Satin Dancer""---are all wondrous hybrids of acoustic beauty and tough-as-nails rock. ""One White Duck/0 = Nothing At All"" is a great solo showcase for Anderson, one of his finest moments on record. And the lengthy suite known as ""Baker St. Muse"" is an awesome Tull piece. And, as an added bonus, this new remastered edition of ""Gallery"" contains five bonus tracks, including such Tull gems as ""Summerday Sands,"" and the flute instrumental, ""Pan Dance."" All in all, ""Minstrel In The Gallery"" is a very good Jethro Tull album."
2,HEY! I'M A TATTERED MINSTREL!! GET IT?!!?,"This is the album where Ian Anderson became a self-parody, a real Olde Englishe minstrel/bard straight from Central Casting. Tull's music always had a strain of English folk in it, but it was always just alluded to and was balanced out by enough blues and rock elements to keep them from sounding like a historic exercise a la Steeleye Span. And while Ian's stage get-up included some strange medieval-looking boots, he basically looked like just another wacky hippie. But for some reason on this album Ian decided he needed to beat everyone over the head with Ye Olde Concept and started appearing on stage in some second-hand Shakespearian garb. He pursued this schtick relentlessly through the next two albums, ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Heavy Horses"", at which time I stopped buying Tull albums."
3,Beginning of Tull bombast,"Technically, the remastering is wonderful. Musically, songs like ""Black Satin Dancer"" and ""Baker Street Muse"" are insufferably long, unfocused, and full of the instrumental noodling and melodic repetition that I always found to be the most unattractive aspect of the Tull oeuvre. It seemed to work on Thick as a Brick and even on A Passion Play, but never again afterward. As I recall, the original release of this album is when I first thought Ian Anderson was getting a little too full of himself, lyrically and musically.The title track is a good straight-ahead rocker and songs like ""One White Duck"" and ""Cold Wind To Valhalla"" have their compelling moments. Otherwise, this is lower-tier Tull.""March the Mad Scientist"", ""Summerday Sands"", and ""Pan Dance"" are delicious bonus tracks. I could do without the abbreviated live tracks, however."
1,Pretty much Jethro Tull's worst recording to this point.,"Try singing to yourself this lyric from Requiem: ""Saw her face in the tear-drop black-cab window""--the chords are Eb, Cm, Bb, and the ""melody"" notes are G-G-G-Ab-G-G-F-F-Eb-Eb-F--, and notice how unmusical it is.How much sense does this lyric make to you? ""Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve and light/The old Valhalla.""And this? ""He polarized the pumpkin-eaters --- static-humming/Panel-beaters --- freshly day-glow'd factory cheaters (salaried and collar-scrubbing).""Does this feeble attempt at humor strike you as hilarious? ""I have no time for Time magazine or Rolling Stone."""
4,"Come Let Me Play with You, Black Satin Dancer!","I don't think there are three better consecutive songs on any Tull album than ""Ministrel in the Gallery"", ""Cold Wind to Valhalla"", and ""Black Satin Dancer."" They all rock and have moments of subtle beauty as well. The flute and guitar performances are some of Martin's and Ian's all-time best. I think the extra tracks compliment the orginal album very nicely, especially ""Summerday Sands"", a real gem, and Pan Dance, a very interesting instrumental piece. This is one of my very favorite Tull albums, (I love them all!), and if you let the ""Minstrels"" into your home, I'm sure you'll love this one too."
5,Minstrel in the Gallery,The next best thing to the vinyl cut of this album - with rich base notes and full bodied sound I would recommend this digital album to any audiophile with an appreciation for the genius of Jethro Tull.
5,Astounding!! But a Warning!!,"1st of all I must warn anyone looking to buy this that the 'live' bonus tracks are studio snippets from a radio program already released on the 20th Ann. Box Set. So forget about them, they fade out after a min. or so....however, this to me is one of Jethro Tull's most amazing lps. the inclusion of Summerday Sands and Pan Dance only enhance it's beauty!! Absolutely recommended!!"
5,One of the greatest progressive/folk/rock albums of all time,"A classic album of great music from one of England's finest bands! This was the final album the band did with Jeffrey Hammond-Hamond on bass, and he went out with a bang! This album was one of their best, giving a great mix of the band's harder rocking stuff with the acoustic folk music influences that sent them apart from most progressive bands. Best songs include One White Duck, Cold Wind To Valhalla, and the title track.Definitely worth owning! The bonus tracks are great too."
4,Another Tulls,I like this cd because include songs that in my opinion are so good has those present in the great albums Aqualung and Thick as a Brick.
2,ehhhh.....,"really not worth it. I agree with the politics essentially, but the writing is so bland and uninteresting, maybe about 3 pages were worth reading. Nothing particularly insightful or interesting to say about conservatism or liberalism, just sort of a presentment of events and an attitude that why everything is ridiculous is obvious"
1,Not for hardcore fans !,"If you are a fan of Kevin Seconds circa ""The Crew"" and ""Walk Together Rock Together"" pass this one by. It does not rock in the least."
4,"A very entertaining book, a mix of thriller and military...","This was a very entertaining book. I am very interested in both ""who dun it"" and military books, and this has both. Clearly, the author has extensive military experience and understands the mind of the fighting forces, he uses that understanding to weave a extremely readable story about a military man who witnesses an wartime atrocity, and his struggle to bring the ""perps"" to justice during the ensuing peace. As with the other reviewer, I am anxiously awaiting Bay's next book. I highly recommend this book."
5,Eye opening,the author paints a full background before the actual translation. A very readable and pleasurable pace is struck as well.
1,I expected more,Reads as a slant towards one belief over the other. Anyone who refers to on believe as democratic over the other obviously is slanted to one side.
5,Odor Buster,"Excellent product. Improves, removes and covers unpleasant order in vehicle. Intially, product ordor is strong but quickly dissapates. Does its job. Would buy again."
4,Hospitality Supervision Textbook Package,"This textbook package contained ""Supervision in the Hospitality Industry"" 3rd Edition hard cover (ISBN# 0-471-19420-0) and National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation-NRAEF ProMGMT Student Workbook (ISBN# 0471-41305-4). Chapter 9 on performance evaluation was the greatest insight. A great learning tool to help focus my job development within the huge vacation/hospitality employer I work for here in Orlando, Florida."
3,Not bad as text books go,"This is the text book for my Human resources class. I got the older edition to save money, but its a bit outdated now."
2,Supervision Class.....,"This book was so boring, for a class that turned out to be just as bad as the book."
3,"Fine introduction to the field, but beware of the math","The first part is introductory, and contains a lot of easy and real-life examples, and is pleasant and interesting to read. However, part 2 and 3, the 'application parts', brought me to tears with the most incomprehensible mathematics."
2,"""Not Really For Beginner's""","When I bought this book I thought that it would help me understand everything I needed to know about dog showing. I thought that it would teach me about how to handle, train, and basically get started in dog showing. The book didn't help me in any of those topics, it said to just go get lessons or attend matches. If you are looking for a book that explains the system and politics of dog showing than this is the book for you. But as for beginners who don't know the first thing about showing this wasn't helpful."
3,Dog Showing for Beginners,"I didn't know anything about showing when I bought my ""Show Potential"" puppy. This book helped me get a feel for what the shows might be like and had some good pointers, but it really didn't give me the things I was looking for, like how to train my puppy, how to get the best performance from her, or what other handlers may do in the ring. I finished the book feeling like I was going to have fun showing, but not to expect to win as a beginner, that beginners rarely get good dogs, and they're really at a disadvantage in the ring. As a beginner, my puppy has already won four out of the five classes I've entered her in (all against stiff competition!). This book helped, but I'm still looking for more information. Good for beginners who want to get a better understanding of the point system and what to expect at a show, but don't stop at this one. Read more!"
2,Amusing but severely lacking the specifics in showing.,"Lynn Hall's ""Dog Showing For Beginners"" is fine for explaining the class structure, point system and politics but totally ignores the mechanics of dog showing. Information on the physical training and handling of your dog is not to be found. The book in two words ""amusing fluff""."
3,"A Realistic, but Sometimes Negative Focus on Owner-Handling","This book presents a very realistic view on the subject of owner/handling dogs. It tends to accentuate the negatives; however those negatives are present in the show ring, and a successful owner handler needs to be aware of them. Don't let that scare you off, the author gives some excellent handling advice for the owner/handler."
5,Great resource,"I liked this book because it explains the ""how's and why's"" of dog showing. For its price, you can not go wrong. I only wished that the author revised this book since within it are dated cost expenses, but if a reader is aware of the published date, they should be able to adjust."
4,EXCELLENT MUSIC COMEDY,"THIS MOVIE STARTS OUT WITH A BAND TRIO CALLED ""THE LOAN RANGERS"" (NO, I DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE). FUNNY NAME. LOL. ANYWAYS THEY ARE DESPERATE TO GET THEIR MUSIC HEARD ON THE RADIO AND GET A RECORD CONTRACT. SO THEY HOLDUP A LOCAL RADIO STATION THAT STARTS TO GET CROWDED OUTSIDE WITH THEIR FANS. THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF FUNNY DILEMAS. THE FUNNY THING IS THEY ARE HOLDING UP THE STATION WITH WATER GUNS FILLED WITH PEPPER SAUCE. HA HA. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!"
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD Movie","Please do not waste your money buying this bad movie.Bad plot, bad acting, bad everything.It's so bad I had to watch the final 30 minutes on fast forward just to get to the end. What a waste of (usually) good actors."
5,I don't want to go jail man i'm fragile,"Before ""George of the Jungle"" and Before ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" Brendon Friaser and Steve Busimice started in ""Airheads""A great comedy about three well meaning but Naive musicians who in order to break it into the big time decide to hold a radio station hostage. They have to keep track of both a bored DJ and a stuck up station manager, they are also being cheered on by a crowd of fellow rockers who have gathered outside of the station.My impression-This movie is funny it also a Meca of great Metal Music hits of the early 90's if I could find the soundtrack I would buy it. I recommend this movie to all"
4,Rock and Party On...,"Yeah, for some people this maybe a little bit strange movie, but at the time i saw it it was right when i was with my band demo looking for radio stations to play it,.. so looking to this guys was like looking to me and my band at that time.If you are a hard rock musician, or were, you will have a lot of fun looking to this movie, have great stuff and footage, white zoombie playing, Lammie as guest,... the girls, the sound(no grunge and drop dead music, only party rock music),.. have some vein of Waynes World, but a little different. I just dont give 5 star cause im not a professional reviewer, so who am i to give 1 or 5 star?... to finish this is the kinda a movie that every rocker lover want to have like Waynes World collection, Bill & Ted collection, Detroit Rock city or Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter is Dead,.. all rock&roll cool movies."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"I definetely recommend this movie to any comedy, music, or Adam Sandler fan! I own this movie on tape, laserdisc, and have pre-ordered this dvd, A Must!"
3,FOR ADAM SANDLER FANS ONLY,"In my opinion, this movie is strictly for fans of the three leading actors, who happen to be three of my favourite all time actors. the script which is not actually that funny is pulled off in wonderful comic style by all three leads(especially Steve Buscemi). I would probably not have enjoyed this movie had it not been for the goofy but way excellent performance of Adam Sandler who I view as a Utopian light of comic wonderfulness."
4,'Airheads' (20th Century Fox) Running time: 92 minutes,"Main reason I'm giving this 1994 movie a four-star rating is for the numerous good lines / scenes that occured through out the film. Plot involved a power metal trio - the Lone Rangers - Chester (Brendan Fraser), Rex (Steve Buscemi) and Pip (Adam Sandler) who scheme to take a local radio station - Rebel Radio and it's staff hostage to secure a record contract. Personally, I tought it was a scream - the couple of scenes that featured Officer Wilson (the late Chris Farley). Definitely makes for a fun time, when you're hanging out on a weekend at a friend's house with a keg. Drink up!"
3,"Eh, bad music but Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler hold it together...","I remember watching this movie on tv years ago and it seemed better than I originally thought. Overall, you could miss this movie and you could go on with life without ever knowing about it."
5,Rock on....,A good light hearted comedy about a bunch of metal heads. If you like Adam Sandler comedies this is a great addition.
5,how can u pluralize 'lone ranger'?!,"this movie is hella funny! its my favorite comedy ever! and on top of that, its entertaining especially to fans of rock music. adam sandler is at the top of his game in this one. the chemistry between fraser, buscemi, and sandler is hilarious! my fav scene is the one when they make pip(sandler) go outside when the cop is standing out there, pure comedy genious. most of the movie i find myself laughing out loud, even when i watch it alone. so if u get the chance, i strongly recommend u get this movie, steal it from a friend if you have to. laterz"
2,Lame,"There are few things worse in this world than an unfunny comedy, and those things are called Batman and Robin and With Honors. Lame lame lame lame, comes to mind when I watched this movie. It just begs you to come up with better punch lines. And how did Joe Mantena (spelling?) get suckered into this thing. Lame."
3,Please people- it wasn't THAT good!,"I did enjoy this movie, it had some good laughs and some great parts in it- but how could anybody say that it was the best movie EVER? Please! It was enjoyable throughout but it had a horrible plot, below average acting, typical comedy. I don't think it deserves * * * * *, it deserves * * *! I'm not that big of a fan of Adam Sandler than I am of Brenden Fraser (he was great it this movie I might add.) Over-all, it was an enjoyable movie, but not THAT great."
3,Not An Oscar Winning Type Of Movie But Still Good!,"I love comedy movies and though Airheads is not my absolute favorite comedy it was pretty entertaining and the actors all gave some funny performances. In this movie, 3 guys who want to be rockstars are having trouble getting the folks at radio stations to listen to and play their demo tapes so they break into a radio station and hold the DJ and staff hostage with demands that they play their demos and though not a movie that would win an Oscar it was a nice little dumb humor movie that is actually quite entertaining."
1,Can I PLEASE have my Freakin' money back!!!,I love Adam Sandler but this movie just plain sucked. I'll GIVE the video to anyone who really wants it. Chris Farley's small role as the rookie police officer was about the only thing funny in the whole movie. Skip it and watch one of Adam's other movies that actually is funny.
1,"sorry, I found this boring","A friend had recommended it as a great read, but I found it dated and boring. General pop science w no stimulating insights. Of course, just my opinion, YMMV"
2,This book is a dud,"I have read the first 4 books in this series with relish and pleasure. This one was too far-fetched to enjoy. The idea that the Commissaris and de Gier are the right people to go undercover in Japan is just unbelievable. Hence, the rest of the story, no matter how ""abstract"" and ""thought-provoking"" just doesn't work. Also, the commissaris is hardly able to get around back in Amsterdam because of his rheumatism, so how is he going to be able to function in such a serious operation in a foreign country (he struggled enough on his trip to Curacao in a previous book). Van de Wetering gave too much detail about sailing and about the party at the daimyo's hideout (that was so annoying). De Gier's attitude in Japan--he has given up on life--is actually the only interesting part of the Japan sting operation.I am already starting the next book with the hope that it will be more like the author's previous Amsterdam mysteries."
5,A Textbook That is NOT boring,"PSSC (Physical Science Study Committee) Physics is a wonderful but hard textbook for high school physics classes, although freshmen attending non-calculus introductory physics courses will find the book suitable for them too. The illustrations (for example the high-speed photograph showings large distortion of a racket and a ball, and the figure showing a toy merry-go-round driven by a falling weight) are excellent and explanations are clear. Reading this book is not a sterile, nor boring task. The book covers Motion, Atom, Electricity, Magnetism, Heat, Light and Wave. For those who do not want to bother with mathematics but like to have some more knowledge on quantum mechanics and relativity (not covered in the book), ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" by Gary Zukay is highly recommended."
1,Teachers Guides for PSSC Physics,"This guide for the PSSC Physics Book was not as advertised. It was not for the correct edition of the book. It turned out to be 4 volumes of problems with answers for the very old D.C. Heath edition of the book. Not even close to the chapters, questions and problems from the 1991 version that they advertised. I was very unhappy with the purchase.The old paperback vols.(1-4) were not in very good condition. The picture shown is a hardback of the proper edition. What I got was nothing like what was shown."
4,Better then the first...,"Great original photography and a whole new look at tattoos...super raw, but oh so cool....not your average tattoo book....but a must own.."
5,Beautiful illustrations,I bought this to replace an identical copy from my childhood that was falling apart. It's a beautiful book with beautiful illustrations. I'm planning on framing some of them for my baby's nursery.
1,Creepy...,"Tis is by far one of the creepiest books I have ever read. I felt like I needed a shower after reading it. Yuk...Clara, an unattractive, crippled heiress agrees to marry handsome, fortune hunting Frederick, who lies and schemes, as she feels it is her only shot at a chance to marry. Frederick does not really have any friends left as he kidnapped a girl who he grew up with (that story is written about in a previous regency), before she was to marry his friend as he needed her money. Then he has to leave town and he runs into Clara, an easy target for Frederick to charm with his good looks. The scenes in bed were awful, Frederick is a creep, Clara is a fool. The book was one of the most unromantic books I have ever had the misfortune to read."
3,Not her finest....,"I am a huge Mary Balogh fan, but this one was not her finest.The hero was a womanizing rake who had a gambling problem, a drinking problem, and a fidelity problem. I thought he was a very dislikable person that I had trouble feeling any empathy towards.The heroine was a wimpy type of woman....obediant, subserviant, and self depracating. I did feel some empathy towards her as I learned how her father had overprotected and sheltered her.This just wasn't very good love story. The hero cheats on Clara throughout the book without any real hope that in the future he'll be any different. I love a great rake book as well as the next girl.....but I like my rakes REFORMED!Let me suggest...A Precious Jewel, The Temporary Wife, More than a Mistress, and The Secret Pearl...these are Balogh at her best!"
5,Do it again......................,"Very few artist have the ability to turn old Motown tunes into successful jazz tunes without risking the outcome sounding like a cross between elevator music or a theme to a tv sitcom. While I'm not totally opposed to R&B remakes turned jazz, Jeff Golub is much too talented to not produce original music of his own. There are two tracks on this cd that are my favorites. Tracks 2 and 4. ""Cut the cake, and ""Jesus Children of America."" Even though I'm at odds with the contents of this particular cd, Jeff Golub delivers outstanding performances on all tracks listed. Got cash? Get the cd. ( ^ _ ^ )"
4,Jeff Golub strikes again!,"If you are into Jeff Golub or are interested in jazz fusion with hollowbody electric guitar as lead instrument, then this album should appeal to you. Smooth, sauve playing."
2,A step backward,"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Jeff Golub; I have all of his previous CDs. His last CD, ""Dangerous Curves"", was the best yet and took a real step away from ""smooth jazz"" (oh, how I hate that term, and the music it describes) and toward a harder-edged sound that I felt really played to Jeff's strengths.Oooops! ""Do It Again"" is a big step BACKWARDS. This CD could be shown in the dictionary as the very definition of ""smooth jazz."" Which is to say, BORING.Also, what's up with the drum programing on what is ostensibly an ""old school R&B"" cover CD? (Especially when you've got a KILLER drummer-- Steve Ferrone-- playing on some of the other cuts.)Sorry... this was a BIG disappointment to me."
5,Magical - A book like this comes along once every 1000 years,"Every few millennia, a book comes along that touches your heart and spirit, leaving you powerless to halt the tremendous urging of your soul to fly far, far away and seek the wonders that you have just read about.Well along the lines of ""Ishmael"", except this is pure non-fiction.Arctic Wild will fascinate you and fill you with a sense of awe and joy, the likes of which you've never felt by reading a book.To say that this book was wonderful would be a terrible understatement - you may never read a book like this again the rest of your life."
5,A Must for Filipino-Americans,"I first read this book because Mrs. Dowlen is a friend of the family. This book brought me closer to my culture and wanting for more.As young Filipinos adapt or are born in the United States, we are assimilated into the American culture often shunning our own heritage.This book allowed me to not only understand the history of our past but a yearning to learn more of where we came from and what our parents and grandparents had to endure in the Philippines.Mrs. Dowlen is a charming lady with so much to share. This book was written from the heart. I appreciate all that she has shared.Please note that all proceeds from her book are being donated to a Christian organization in the Phillippines."
3,Minha irm gostou,Parece q o produto atende ao propósito. Foi uma compra q minha irm pediu e muitas mulheres usam. Pode ser um bom presente.
5,"Actually, one of Tull's best albums","This album, i don't understand the negativity towards it. is it because of the self ironically cheeky concept? The fact that it doesn't have a song over 8 mintues, or even 6? Forget that; this is one of Ian's best collections of songs.What sets it apart from other Tull albums you say? The fact that is has one of Ian's most perfect collections of melodies and themes ever assembled. No, it's hardly as complex as Ministrel. Yes, it's occasionally a bit show tuneish (the title track) but hey, just listen to these songs. You can sing them to yourself later. You have them all memorized you Tull fans you. Listen to this album again."
3,received but low volume,"i received the product in a timely manor but, the volume i really low. have to turn it up loud."
1,Too long at the fair.,"The penultimate song on John Lennon's first post-Beatles record ends thus: ""I don't believe in Beatles. I just believe in me, Yoko and me; that's reality. The dream is over. What can I say? The dream is over--yesterday. I was the dream weaver, but now I'm reborn. I was the walrus, but now I'm John. And so, dear friends, you'll just have to carry on. The dream is over.""There is something to be said for getting out while the getting out is good. The difficulties with ""A Passion Play"", the initial recording sessions as well as the concerts, ought to have made it clear that the end was at hand. We could have been spared the excruciating torment of the vacuous singles ""Bungle in the Jungle"" and ""Too Old to Rock, Too Young to Die"" and of the interminable series of dreadful Tull LP's and CD's beginning with ""War Child"" and including ""Heavy Horses"", ""Stormwatch"", etc."
3,not quite up to par for tull,"This album is not up to par with Jetrho Tulls' previous releases (Aqualung, Thick As A Brick..etc.)""Quizz Kid"" is a cool song with great lyrics and jammin'. ""Crazed Institution"" is a fairly good song but gets old after a couple of listens. ""Salamander"" is a decent acoustic work by Anderson but just never appealed to me. ""Taxi Grab"" is a great song with a very catchy riff and melody. ""From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser"" is just a filler in my opinion. ""Bad Eyed 'N' Loveless"" is a forgettable piece of music I always skip over. ""Big Dipper"" is a great song with the classic Anderson flute standard. The title track is a great song and it alone gives this mediocre album 3 stars. ""Pied Piper"" is another filler in my opinion. ""The Chequered Flag"" is my favorite song mainly because it's just beautiful. But out of it all, this album is basically hit-and-miss."
4,Never Too Old Too Rock 'n' Roll,"Once again this one just doesn't rate in Tull's top 5 albums, but having said that, it is remarkable for its stand alone quality (think Broadsword) in Tulls catalogue.This is the closest Tull ever came to mainstream R n R, and not really that close at that. It really is hard to fault this album at all and it will remain one of my favorites just for being what it is. Once again I will state NEVER COMPARE Tull albums and don't listen to those that do, you'll only be dissapointed and might miss a classic for your ears.No doubt the remastering of this one was warranted, but once again the added tracks nearly destroy this masterpiece, it finishes forever with ""The Chequered Flag"" and that is how it should be. Find the original if you can."
3,Good remaster for an OK recording,"Compared to Jethro Tull's previous recording (Minstrel In The Gallery), Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young To Die was a bit of a disappointment. Sure, the inventive song construction was still in play as was the solid performance skills of the band. But something was missing here. Personally, I think it's the energy that was so evident on Minstrel only rears its head occasionally on Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll.Still, there are some good tunes present--particulary Quiz Kid, Crazed Institution, Salamander, and Pied Piper. Basically, Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Old To Die is a great half recording. It is the weakest of Tulls 1970's output.Sonically, the remaster is a pleasure and puts to shame all previous versions. If you consider yourself an ardent Tull fan, you want this."
3,Certainly not their best,"Jethro Tull over the years has made many great albums. I dont need to go down the list.Too old to Rock and Roll is a very average release.To me the highlight is: Salamander. Salamander in my mind is probably their finest acoustic song of their career. Ian Anderson really came up with a great song, it is simply a masterpiece.The rest of the CD is worth listening to, but not their best by any means.Salamander alone is worth the purchase."
1,"This book should be recalled, horrible style is taught!","I don't even know where to begin to describe how bad this book is but perhaps teh following two examples are enough1. The author spends more time on modules then objects: has a chapter on modules way before the chapter on objects. Hasn't the author been listening to Microsoft that VB .NET is a fully object oriented language - modules should not be used therefore, objects everywhere!2. The author advocates Hungarian notation even though the VB .NET team says in the online help not to use it!Again I have to ask: why didn't Microsoft Press run this book by anybody on the Visual Basic .NET team? The principles it suggests go completely against what teh team members say in their talks.This book should be recalled. For a company that produced a great VB .NET book like Balena's, they should be ashamed of themselves for putting this one out!To sum up: avoid this book at all costs, it will only hurt you .NET development skills!"
2,Did you say VB.NET or VB6?,"I bought this book, because I had the VB6 one and was wondering a similar material, but adapted to .NET. If fails short and it's just decorating my desk. The author keeps the same guidelines, for example it recommends using Hungarian when Microsoft guidelines says DO NOT USE IT (even though it's a Microsoft Press book!). Take a look at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconNETFrameworkDesignGuidelines.aspThose guidelines are more PRACTICAL and useful than this book. And you know what? IT'S FREE!!!"
5,Excellent recipes,"I think this is a fantastic book for people who are sensitive to sugar and those who wish to increase their use of whole grains in baking. I found these recipes easy to use, including making my own Fruit Juice Reduction. An earlier reviewier noted that she was confused about the fruit juice reduction containing corn syrup. If I am reading Mani Niall's book correctly, the fruit juice concentrate should NOT contain corn syrup. All this means is spending a minute or two reading labels in the freezer section of your local market and making sure the fruit juice concentrate you purchase contains only 100% unsweetened fruit juice."
3,Fructose and corn syrup,"I like the idea of using natural sweeteners in baking and the author suggests other sweeteners aside from juice concentrate reductions. Although that is the predominant sweetener that is used for many of the recipes. I'm very pleased with the variety of recipes, cookies, brownies, cakes and the creative use of flour free, egg free ingredients. I just wish he included more recipes here maple sugar, honey or molassas were the primary sweeteners."
5,great cook book,"great book for sugar free treats. the recipes call for fruit sweeteners, and are really good."
2,NOT FOR VEGANS!,"Reading ""Rachel's"" review makes it sound a little like a vegan might enjoy this book? Well, if you are vegan, like me, you WON'T! It is stuffed with recipes including eggs, butter, milk, cream, buttermilk...! VERY few recipes in this book are truly vegan! So it eliminates white sugar...big whoop...true vegans don't use white sugar to begin with (bone char)! I am not saying this isn't a good book - but it ain't for vegans! (Unless you are a vegan with a whole lotta money and don't mind paying [money] for about 15 recipes...!)"
3,this book is not going to be a part of my collection...,"I love to bake. And I love to bake healthy. The way I see it, the whole point of having a dessert is to enjoy it. I can not say that I enjoyed items that I baked using recipes from this book. I did not feel very well after ingesting so much fruictose.And I am confused... The book says that fruit juice consentrates are less refined sweeteners than sugar. But then, a lot of fruit juice consentrates are loaded with high fruictose corn syrup. So, is the author suggesting that corn syrup is healthier than sugar? Is it?"
3,Didn't impress me,"I bought this item on 50% sale. The so called double-chain was just okay, not unique enough. The pendant is absolutely out of my taste. I knew its gonna be large before I purchased it, due to the description. But still, the effect of a really big and spuare-shaped pendant dangling around creates a rather dull feeling. However, even if it does not fit my taste, it might be fair looking to some other buyers. I give it three stars due to the fact that I am not impressed by it."
4,Designing Effective Instruction for Secondary Social Studies,"While the issue I have is the 1995 edition I found this book fairly useful. While nothing in it ""reinvents the wheel"" the information is concise and well laid out. It is a good resource for any beginning high school history teacher."
5,LOVE,"Luis Miguel is a very intelligent guy ans beutiful too, so I like to read, to listen his music is a very good musician, I love him that's why my title is love."
1,Men Are NOT Women's property and women aren't men's property,"These ladies were obviously spoiled. If you're getting played, don't say it's the other woman's fault, say it's the man'z fault, and we ain't no woman's f*ckin' property!!!!!!!!!"
5,This Single is SUPER HOT!!!,"If you like music with a great beat, this song is for you. When you play it, you'll want to turn the volume as high as it will go. This song is a sure #1!!!!!!!"
4,An interesting book,"There's nothing like reading the original. Here is the abstract theory of transfinite ordinals described by its originator, Georg Cantor.It's probably not the best introduction to set theory for a beginner. The book focuses more on ordinal numbers than on cardinals or general sets. It's not a great reference, either, since so many important results in set theory have been proven in the 100 years since Cantor. But I like this book a lot nonetheless. The exposition is beautiful -- concise, clear, and logical. It's one of the most nicely presented math books I've read."
1,First 20 years,This book is too technical for the general reader. You have to know all about Christianity to follow it. After 40 pages I had to give it up.
1,Hmmm...Can you really sit through this?,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. I don't know what all the fuss was about, but this movie was horrible. Don't waste your time. I think giving it even 1 star is a little too generous."
5,excellent,I absolutely loved this book. i picked it up at border's one day and decided i'd give it a try. that was probably one of the best decisions i have ever made. i know people who have or do go through the same things that Pip deals with in the book. Jaye Murray shows what it's really like when you have addictions and family problems that no one ever talks about. what it's like to feel like you're the only one that has no control at all. I honestly couldn't put this book down until i had finished it.
4,Good for basics,I would recommend this book for make-up artists. Good way to become educated on the face.
2,very disappointed,I have never been so upset about a purchase. I enjoy looking at pictures in makeup books. But not on cheap paper and 99.9% of photos are in black and white. It's overloaded with information and not appealing to read. I own lots of makeup books and this is the first time I've been so upset that I felt like I needed to write this review. Save your money!
2,A Little Wrong,"Well I bought this and it said it was the 9th edition but it was the 8th, and it upset me because I payed that much for a lower edition. but the shipment was in good time and everything but they lied about what edition it was.."
5,stage makeup,"Excellent book! A must have for any actor, aspiring makeup artist or anyone who is just interested in makeup."
4,Needs more color plates,"Overall, this is a very strong text with a lot of detail. Most of the photographs in the book are in black and white. There are a few at the end of the book in color. I would have like for all of the photographs to be in color."
4,Great Purchase Experience,"This item was received extremely quickly and was in great condition. I was a little disappointed when I saw that none of the photos in the book were in color. They are all black and white, which makes the photos of each of the steps a little difficult to see."
4,"New, but not improved.","While this book remains a ""bible"" in its field, my students complain about the price and the lack of color demonstrations. I was hoping the Ninth Edition of this book would have more color photos spread throughout the chapters, but the format has remained very much the same, with many of the same demonstrations and photo descriptions. The new chapters for film and television are a breath of fresh air and I applaud the new techniques aditions."
5,A Film-Maker's Dream,"I am a film-maker out of Ohio. I used to use Tom Savini's Bizarro, Grande Illusions 1, Grande Illusions 2, and Dick Smith's Do-It-Yourself guides....BUT, after meeting Tom Savini and learning that he considers this book his ""bible"", I checked it out for myself. WOW! This is the book to get for anyone interested in stage make-up or special effects makeup. It IS a little pricey, but for the information and detail, it cannot be beat. I consider this a companion to the ones listed above. Get em all if you can, but make sure you OWN this one!!!!!"
3,very few color pages,"I remembered this book from theater classes in college. I was surprised that so many of the pages were not in color and not printed on standard book paper. The first section is on a very thin paper, almost like a telephone book. I was shocked. The information in the book is good. Most all basics of makeup are covered. The prosthetic section has a lot of out-dated methods that still work but look very 80s sci-fi/horror. Overall it is a lot to pay for so little color demonstrations. If you are just starting out and need the basics of contour and shadow work, this book is handy. If you are looking for pictures, inspiration and color demos... keep looking."
2,Book is 15 years old,Book is over priced would be worth it at a 1/4 to a 1/5 of the price obviously marked up for students being forced to buy the book. Book is dated the pictures in it look like they are black and white photos from the 60's in it. Hal Holbrook for example looks to be in his 40's. It's a photo series from when he played Mark Twain in 1967.
4,The TRUE Classic!,"This is the Pinocchio film for ""Children of the 80's"", such as myself! This film is ten times better than the original, and if you've actually seen other Filmation productions, this one will blow you away! Very improved animation( compared to most other Filmation productions), excellent story( somewhat of a continuation to the original), and the Emperor of the Night is so freakin' awesome! This is a MUST-SEE! I remember originally seeing this in 1988, at the age of 6, and I love it even more, now! If this was Filmation's final production before going out of business in 1989, they definitely went out with a ""bang""!"
2,Not as I remembered it,"I saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. I thought it was the greatest ever. I was dazzled by the animation, esp of the Fairy Godmother and the Emperor of the Night. I also loved the song ""Love is the Light Inside Your Heart"".I guess the perceptions of a 24 year old are very different from those of a 10 year old. I received the video and was disappointed. The animation was terrible, the sound was bad and the story was overly simplistic. Even the song wasn't as I'd remembered it...."
2,bizarre but faulty,"When I first saw this when I was six, it really creeped me out. The scene with Pinocchio being transformed into a puppet again was chilling to me. However, I recently got the idea to watch it again. So I ordered it used off of Amazon. This time I noticed its faults. The songs are mediocre and the plot unmemorable. However, it does have its creepiness to keep it from being absolutely terrible, but that's not enough of a reason for me to recommend it."
2,This product has design flaws,"The display panel on this product is difficult enough to read as it is, but stationing this item at a distance any greater than 6 inches away from close scrutiny renders the screen completely unreaderly. Once while sitting in the tub I had to construct an elaborate placement of mirrors based upon the system of representation in Velasquez's Las Meninas just so I could view the display screen as I leisurely leaned back in the tub to skip tracks!(In this instance skipping the Lyric Suite for string quartert by Alban Berg to a serene and more bath-worthy recording of a didgeridoo, whale noises and soft synth pads.)Thankfully I am a student of art history or else I may have distatefully invested in a small periscope, or an unfashionable pair of opera glasses just to view the screen from my vantage in the tub.2 stars. Sony, you can do better."
1,Lasted ONE WEEK,"I expect a lot more from Sony. Christmas to New Years is, what? One week? This Walkman will no longer read any disk. Even with fresh batteries. And if the Walkman WORKED, the difficult to read buttons wouldn't be an issue."
2,worked great at first...,"I bought this cd player just last week, i needed something for a plane ride and i thought this looked so cute and i was very pleased to read the no skip function, the first time i used it it worked great! i loved it, it didn't skip at all, it was light weight, but the next day when i went to use it it kept reading No Disc, i changed the batteries, tried different cds but nothing work. I soon realized it wasn't spinning as easly as it was supposed to, i got it to work but i had to lift up the round spinner thingie, place the cd on, and then place the round thing back in the cd player and i had to make sure it didn't get to close to the base. I bought it from Walmart and i live an hour away so I've had to wait til tomorrow before i can get back up there and return it, at first i was just gonna replace it with a new one but after reading these reviews I'm gonna get a different one, and this time not just pay attention to the way it looks."
4,Nice player,"This is a nice little cd player. I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, and she loves it. It is very ""simple"" to use, and plays CDRs fine. I like it because it is not over controled by all sorts of complicated bells and whistles that takes an electrical engineer to operate. Very easy for my 8 year old to use. She is still on her first set of batteries, and she has had it now for about 3 weeks. She listens to it for about a hour a day after school. Nice unit for the money."
1,Dont Bother,"This was a refurbished item that was still broken when i got it. None of the buttons work, it was very poorly packeged, and the cd player itself looks very cheaply made which is probly why it falls apart."
2,so sad,"as you've read previously, this is such a terrible drop in quality for Sony. i don't know what it was. i'm guessing they're sacrificing quality for quantity. whatever it is, this cd player is the pits compared with previous Sony models."
1,dont buy this,"dont buy this!!! i made the mistake of ignoring the bad comments , bought it, and a week after is not working!!!!don t waste your time and money"
1,Horrible,"When I bought this item through Amazon.com the website stated that it featured shock protection. However, once I received the item and began using it I quickly learned that it did not feature any sort of shock protecting. The sticker on the device reads g-protection, but its anyone's guess what the hell that is if it is in fact not a shock protection feature."
2,Great while it lasts,"I bought this in 2005, long before my first mp3 player. It was a nice little cd player and worked well until last year, when I made the mistake of putting a scratched CD inside it. All of a sudden, it spun the disk very slowly. After that happened, it never worked again - just kept spinning any disk I put in it really slowly and the display will eventually read 'no disc'. Just now I tried using it again with fresh batteries and there is this snapping noise along with the super slow disk spinning.Anyway, it was great while it lasted. The controls on the front were kind of awkward and inconvenient but it had nice features and sounded okay."
1,Read the reviews and AVOID!,"I should have read the reviews. This is a bad product: Where to begin? Difficult to read, poorly positioned display, difficult to see and use control buttons. Fiddly battery location. And the final straw - ""no disc"" now permanently displayed. Time to junk this piece of junk. I'm ashamed - I'm a designer, I've should have spotted these flaws."
5,Great Discman,"I had one of these for 2+ years and it worked awesomely. I'm actually going to buy another one just because i like it so much. I have had many personal cd players in the past that skipped for no reason and were totally horrible. When I finally got my own job, I shelled out 5 extra bucks and got something that was 10 times the quality of a $15 walkman. I only had problems with skipping discs when my son decided that it was a great toy... hahaha! I would recommend this to anyone as a great, inexpensive walkman."
3,not good balance.,"Well, this walkman is cheap. What else can you expect?To say honestly, the quality of sound is still very good.However, left side and right side is not a perfect balance.Maybe it is the earphone's problemBut I have measure the resistance, they are the same.So I am really curious now."
3,Lookwise good,i think this one looks very cool. Particularly the blue one.would have been better if it plays Mp3.
5,Great Genealogical Resource,"Although the text of this book is available on-line for free, the free version has a multitude of OCR translation errors that make it difficult to read at times. It is much better to have a correct copy to read.You might not be related to the Armistead family, but their history is the history of early America. You are sure to find something in this well-researched book that will help you in your genealogical quest."
1,Complete Garbage,"I honestly thought this would be shadowboxing drills, it is not. Its just them talking about shadowboxing and trying to hock their products, was not worth the money at all. ""You can add dumbbells to shadowboxing or many of our other ringside products."".....wow, thanks, totally worth 15 bucks."
3,Good book,"This book was very good, but I read Beauty first. A lot of the same things happen in Rose Daughter that happened in the previous work. But it was very well written, like all Robin McKinley books. I would definately read it if you are a fan."
2,Always disappointing,"I've read Rose Daughter twice now and I didn't like it much better the second time. Robin McKinley is my favorite author and this is one of my least favorite of her books (behind Dragonhaven). It just doesn't fit together. The writing is as beautiful as ever, but the story seems like a lot of unrelated ideas sort of smashed together."
3,"More mature, but not necessarily better","I love Robin McKinley for her detailed characterizations and extended metaphors, but Rose Daughter proved a bit too much for me. Beauty was so mature this time I couldn't believe she was a real young person. In addition, she spent almost NO time getting to know the Beast and ALL her time (I mean litterally half the book) planting roses, pruning roses, thinking about roses, fertilizing roses. I mean, enough is enough. The ending, therefore, was confusing and unjustified. I enjoyed her first version, Beauty, much more, though the flaws I found there were not corrected in Rose Daughter, as I felt they should have been. Still, McKinley does have some beautiful passages, and I am only being so critical of her because I am acquainted with what she CAN do. A good book, but not magic."
2,"New Perspective on Beauty and the Beast, but confusing","I was disappointed with this book. All of McKinley's books up to this point had at least been good. I found this book very slow moving and the characters not that well developed. I found that a lot of the conflict was not concluded at the end of the book. I am a sucker for happy endings and this did not have a very good one. It did, however, give me a different veiw on the story of Beauty and the Beast."
2,If you like Alice in Wonderland...,"You might like this. While I love the story of Beauty and the Beast, I have to say that this was a incredibly over written book. The entire book seems to drag painfully and tediously through every tiny, inconsequential, insignificant detail. The language and dialogue are like those of Alice in Wonderland. The characters are incredibly unrealistic and unbelievable. To be fair, very rarely the story becomes interesting, which is why I rate it with two stars, but most of the time it's unbearably dull."
3,okay book,I liked Beauty much better than this book. IN this book she seems a little too perfect and flawless. In beauty she is more spunky and just portrayed better.
3,The First One's Better,Not nearly as good as Beauty. McKinley doesn't explain things as well. Not a real good read.
2,Disappointing,"For a book of this length, the characters are flat, the beginning of the story is not adequately developed and the ending is rushed. The ""ghost story"" is the most interesting part and would probably be a better book. There is no reason described in this book for Beauty and the Beast to fall in love."
1,"Read ""Beauty"" instead","Years ago, I read Beauty, McKinley's first attempt at the Beauty and the Beast story. I loved it. Earlier this year, I picked it up again and read it. It held up well and I still find it incredibly charming.Given how much I enjoyed Beauty, I really wanted to read ""Rose Daughter"" and see how McKinley's second crack at the tale fared. I expected a lot. I assumed McKinley would have matured as a writer and I was hoping to love it as much as I loved Beauty.I was wrong.The term 'florid prose' springs to mind. This novel is absolutely strangled by the egregiously wordy prose. You have to wade through painfully winding and ultimately pointless descriptions of everything, large and small. After slogging through a single run-on sentence that choked up the better part of an entire page, I threw the book away. This novel is a fine example of writing at its worst."
2,"What happened, Robin?","I was SO excited when this book came out- ""Beauty"" , of course, having been one of my all-time favorite books as a girl. Surely the amazing Ms.McKinley could strike gold again, especially with such a beloved story! But... But... I started reading the book and... nothing! I could not get into the book at all. The exciting, colorful immediacy of ""Beauty"" seemed to have vanished... All that seemed to be left was a dull, abstract narrative where the heroine spent an incessant amount of time puttering about her flowers. I felt very disappointed indeed. First ""Deerskin,"" now this! What happened, Robin?"
3,An interesting retelling of Beauty and the Beast,"My first introduction to Robin McKinley's work was with Beauty. My daughters and I LOVED Beauty. So far 3 of us have read Rose Daughter and while we liked it, we did not LOVE it. The story was fine, but we all found it a bit confusing to follow. I don't regret the purchase and plan to read it again. If I could have I would have given it 3.5 stars."
4,My Favorate Author,"I thought ""Rose Daughter"" was one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books.Sure my review was short,but it's long enough to tell everyone what I think about the book."
2,Disappointing. Truly tragically disappointing.,"I absolutely adored Beauty, McKinley's first novel. Rose Daughter? No. Not. At. All. Whereas Beauty had a spunky heroine, full of doubts, ideas, and heart, *this* Beauty has no soul. She's merely lost in the vague, page-long descriptions, muddy plot, and inching action. I was bored to tears, and frustrated with the rambling sentences and wooden dialogue. I like my magic in big doses, but it would take a sorcerer's potion poured through my ear to get me to try to attempt this mess again."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I loved Robin McKinley's ""Beauty"" so much, I was hesitant to read ""Rose Daughter""; and rightly so. While I try to recognize growth and maturity in McKinley's much more elaborate and imaginative retelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, I was still disappointed. Embarassing as it is for the feminist in me to admit, I thoughroughly enjoy a good fairy tale, and what made ""Beauty"" so wonderful was the main character and her strength and resilence; not the wild departure from the classic storyline that ""Rose Daughter"" has. I admire McKinley's tenacity, especially in her unusual ending, but I hated seeing the classic story gone so astray in the name of originality."
2,"Um, yuck?","ok, i have to admit that some of the details in rose daughter were lovely, but a bit too much at times. i mean, how much time can a person spend in a rose garden anyway? take my advice and read Ms. McKinley's earlier book Beauty. it remains one of my favorites."
3,"Fantatically written, but the heart of the classic is gone","I love the classic story of Beauty and the Beast. McKinley's Beauty was great. Rose Daughter is so interesting to read and her descriptions are so beautiful and vivid it was difficult to put down. Yet the characters were two dimensional and the love story was almost nonexistant, you didn't see Beauty grow to love the Beast. Yes, the artistic and poetic aspects of the book were nice but the spirit of the story was lost when too many other details were mixed in."
1,Disappointing,"I have read such McKinely books as ""The Blue Sword"", ""The Hero and the Crown"" and the original Beauty and the Beast tale and sadly this book cannot compare. The language was so difficult to follow that the plot was extremely confusing. Her attempt at ""mature"" writing in fact led to pages of descriptions that when you finished reading them it led you to a headache. It made the Oddysey look like an easy read. This book was simply, over written. I love her earlier books but it seems as time goes on Robin's books decrease in quality and legibility.""Rose Daughter"" to me is a lesser version of her first, if you want to read about Beauty and the Beast read her first version, trust me you will not regret it."
2,Too Much Nonsense,"Rose Daughter was a terrible bore. I don't want to put down Ms. Mckinley, her novels are great, but this was just a bit dissapointing in comparison to her previous works. Rose Daughter was highly detailed, for the worst I would say. The plot was going around in circles, and the most dissapointing thing is that this book was of such tremendous weight, but nearly 40% of the book's size could have been reduced if there was less tedious useless details."
3,"McKinley is slipping, alas","I am disappointed in this book. I often use McKinley as an example of how to write: her works are clear, concise, and contain vivid imagery. There are scenes in The Blue Sword which, even after 15 years and countless readings, cause me to hold my breath. But in the future I shall have to specify which McKinley books show these virtues.In this book her imagery is not vivid, it is fuzzy. There is so much murky description that I lost track of the action and very little seemed to actually happen. I had noted this in Deerskin but attributed it to the difficulty of the subject matter. Now I think it might be the author."
1,One of the dullest books I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A very dissapointing Mckinley novel. I find ZEL by Donna Jo Napoli a much more exciting and mature spin-off of a fairytale. Nevertheless, I'd rather reread Beauty."
2,A Disappointment,"This book was wonderful to read until the end. The ending shocked me and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe Robin McKinley was trying to make this retelling ""her own"". If she was, she should have chosen another way to do it."
3,Just ok,"This was an ok book (please see title!) and I don't mean to say that is sucks by only giving it three stars, it was an ok book. Beauty was sensitive and caring, just like she should be, but she had this passion for the roses which really got to me. Sure she can like roses, but I think Robin McKinley went a little overboad on the topic. Also, the Beast stayed a Beast! That was just wrong! The Beast can't stay a Beast because that ruins the entire story! Sorry if I ruined anything for people out there, but I really didn't like that part. I personally liked McKinley's other book, Beauty, better."
4,"Wow, what a book! This is a book on your must read list!","I believe this book was so much better than Robin McKinley's first book, Beauty. I loved Beauty, but the author went into so much depth with Rose Daughter. The whole story is based on the movie Beauty and the Beast, but in the book every detail is described so well, that you really feel like you're the main character. Beauty, the main character, went through so much adventure, that it was so exciting and thrilling to read on. Beauty has the power to make roses bloom and has the power to transform the heart of the Beast."
3,A good read,"I found this story to be not as absorbing as McKinley's other stories, but her wonderful style of writing still made it a good read. I found myself to be more empathic towards Lionheart and her story, rather than Beauty though."
4,not as good as Beauty,"This book was good but a little too, I don't know, I guess you cold say involved but that doesn't seem like the right word. It's basically like Ms. McKinley wrote Beauty over again, changing a few things, and making it worse... The ending is kinda weird and a little gross when you think about it. But, if you are willing to struggle through it, it's a good book."
3,"Good, but not her best","I know I'm running the risk of being redundant because this has been said by many other readers, but McKinley's first interpretation of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the better of the two works. Perhaps devoted McKinley fans like myself love the first book better because it was the original. However, McKinley has found new and charming ways of making this a wonderful story, and the book is a worthwhile read for fans both of faerie tales and of McKinley."
1,"TOO little EMOTIONS, TOO much JUNK","Dear me, this book was huge, and was definately not worth the weight carrying around when you read it. There was too little on the sister's emotions, emotions and human interaction feelings are crucial in a great book. There was just too much trees wasted on describing nothing. Just read BEAUTY again, it was worth much more of my time to say the least..."
3,the best but the worst,the book rose daughter by robin mckinly was pretty good. I read about 2+ hrs a day. I love rading and this is a good book to read. to me this is a twisted version of one of my favorite fairy tales. no offence to robin mckinly but to me the stoy was ruined at the end which i won't tell. i think that beauty was far better than this book (story wise) but rose duaghter had better detales and misteries to slove in your head.
2,Totally wrong ending,"Have you ever read a book that was absolutly perfect untill the end? The end of this book destroys the whole point of the fairy tale. I was so disapointed. It seemed that McKinley just threw everything together to create an ending. I was so excited, this book was so good untill the last two or three chapters. Then it just disgusted me. I would write a whole new ending for this book and then it would be perfect. But unless you want to write your own ending, don't waste time or money on this book. I must say though, that the sisters were great and I loved the way she wrote them. That was actually worth my time. I gave a star to each of them."
5,Rose Daughter,"Robin McKinley has done it again in this variation of the classic fairy tale, Beauty and the Beast. Unlike her previous book, Beauty, Rose Daughter is more in depth and differs dramatically from the original story of Beauty and the Beast. This was an enjoyable book because of its vivid imagery and realistic characters. It is truly one of Robin McKinleys' most entertaining and imaginative books."
5,A Refreshing Change,"Reader beware: the only way to read this book is to NOT compare it to ""Beauty."" Otherwise you will be disappointed because it is not the same book and takes on a different perspective to the tale. However, the characters are more realistic and complex. Lionheart and Jeweltounge (the sisters) were interesting characters although I really liked what she did with the beast the best. He was much more ""human"" in terms of emotions and his relation to Beauty. A good book. Not quite as happy as ""Beauty"" but definitely a nice read."
2,A disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Robin McKinley. I've loved the Damar books since I was a teenager, Deerskin was excellent, I reread Beauty often. I pounced on Rose Daughter as soon as it came out, but it was a big disappointment. The heroine is much less compelling than McKinley's original Beauty, and the characters in general have less depth. In some ways this makes it more like an actual fairytale (Beauty's sisters have names reflecting their personalities, for example, and McKinley creates deliberately parallel storylines for them.) However, the plot completely fails to pull together the different threads of the story, some of which seem completely pointless. The Beast is an artist? And where did these unicorns come from?! McKinley's attempt to avoid a predictable ending results in one that is completely improbable. I won't say don't read this if you are a die-hard fan, but if it is the first of her books you have picked up I suggest you reach for one of her stronger works instead."
1,She has really changed. Not worth it.,"Robin McKinley's style of writing has really changed and for the worse. Her books are now slow-moving and the stories have definitely taken a darker side. I enjoyes her earlier retelling of Beauty and the Beast much better. The characters were easy to relate to and it had a more ""fairy tale"" feeling. The plot in Rose Daughter is confusing and undefined. The curse was badly explained and it is unrealistic that she would have fallen in love with the beast in under a week while months go by in the outside world. Bottom line: not worth it."
1,Don't read unless it's your last resort,"What is there to ponder and think about? NOTHING! This book is full of nonsense, junk, pure trash if you ask me. Some authors do a great book at writing blunt stark images and passages... this author isn't one of them, and this book isn't worth the time. But if you're like me and have read all of Mckinley's books, you might as well read this one just for the heck of it.This is one of those typical giddy teenage girl's book...no class, status, or elegance in this book like that of ADAM BEDE, SILAS MARNER, TESS OF THE DURBERVILLES, MADAME BOVARY, or SISTER CARRIE. Those books are The classics that will and have lasted through decades if not centuries."
4,"Not her best, but still good","First off, I adore Robin McKinley's books, period, but of all her books, this has got to be the only one I didn't feel good about when I finished reading it. I thought the story was only so-so and that she over did the details. It's bad when you are forced to skim paragraphs...much less full pages. I think this is probably her weakest novel and that she should have only written one retelling of Beuaty and the Beast. The story was good, and if you aren't a hard core McKinley addict you could probably look at it objectively and not compare it to legendary books like the Blue Sword or the Hero and the Crown, but alas I cannot. The story is over done,detailed, and written, but I still think people should give it a good try. Give McKinley a try. The ending was disappointing, but refreshing, and it's worth reading atleast once."
2,I'm Confused,"I am sorry to write this review, but I had trouble with this version of Beauty and the Beast.I had read the earlier version of this story by the same author and enjoyed it very much. I was excited to find this book and dived right in.... to find it confusing and choppy. It starts out well enough but seems to lose the charm of the fable when our heroine leaves for the castle. In some areas the discriptions become vauge and in others there is too much information. It left me disappointed with a lot of questions afterwards.** Please stick with the first version by this author called ""Beauty"". It was well written with the flow that this wonderful tale deserves."
3,Still trying to finish it three years later!,"I'm very disappointed with Rose Daughter. It's ""visually"" stunning, but I find myself tripping over the dense imagry McKinley drips from every sentence. ""Beauty"" is my favorite book, and I'd hoped ""Rose Daughter"" could measure up. Three years later, I'm still trying to finish it."
1,"Oh my gosh, where should i start...","I enjoyed reading Mckinley's first Beauty and the Beast novel Beauty more than this one. It was much too long, tedious, detailed, and seemed to drage aimlessly in no direction to end the story. Between most of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tales I've read and heard, this is just another one of them in the heap. Beauty stood out, but Rose Daughter just... sits. If you want to read a fairytale taken story, you may want to read Zel (rupunzel) by Donna Jo Napoli and Ella Enchanted (cinderella) by Gail Levine more than Robin Mckinley's latest novel. They are beautifully written and there IS a point in the story."
2,Not McKinley's best work,"I fell in love with Robin McKinley with the novel Beauty, her first write of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. It was an amazing novel, and I was excited to see she had rewritten the tale a second time. Rose Daughter, however, falls sadly short of McKinley's other work. The writing style is difficult and choppy to follow, too many sentences are strung together to make the words flow smoothly. This was the greatest drawback to the novel and made it much inferior to Beauty. At the story's finish, you realize the novel has only spanned a few days, but it felt like centuries to wade through McKinley's over-wordiness and failing attempts at a more ""advanced"" writing style.What is more, Rose Daughter isn't different enough to even have points for originality, or a very clever plot. I would definitely suggest against purchasing this book, and instead sticking to Beauty."
2,"Lots of photos, little substance","I returned this book, because it wasn't what I wanted. I skimmed it over, and there are a lot of pretty pictures, but it is mostly about silk, only cursory information about other materials, lots about one authors specific projects. Most of the instructional info can be found free on the internet."
3,Maybe as a reference book,"I expected something a little more from this book. It breaks down groups of people/markets into clusters and gives descriptions of the clusters one by one. There is not a lot threading it together. Granted, I gave it a quick look and put it on the coffee table for a couple of months. But, I was underwhelmed. I suspect it may be useful for a pure marketing type instead of an armchair sociologist like myself."
3,"Loved the Concept, Found the Book Tedious","I've always enjoyed demographincs and considerd it the marriage of my computer and sociological interest way back in he 1980's. I enjoyed the book but I found myself wanting an option for classifying myself, I settled on 'Urban Gold Coast' or 'Money and Brains'. Also, the book was somewhat redundant about overseas markets, although the book was enjoyable overall."
1,Item does not exist,I ordered this item THREE times and each time was sent the wrong item. I finally called the manufacturer and they said they are updating there catalog so beware you probably won't get what you order. Amazon was nice and did keep giving me free return labels but what a waste of time!
2,Isn't sitting flush against dashboard,"Doesn't sit flush against the dash unit of my 2004 Ford Taurus. Not a huge deal for most, but that type of thing really bugs me. Overall has a cheap feel. Got the job done, though. Would not recommend. I'd say pay more money to get something you know will fit exactly right in your vehicle."
4,Politics as we fear it is or may become. Thrilling!,"I was impressed by Sabin Willett's first effort, The Deal, and awaited his next book very impatiently. The Betrayal more than satisfied. I love his plot, reality can be suspended when it can be believed possible. The way he fleshes out his characters makes them visible in your mind. You like the 'good guys' and you feel the evil of the bad ones. I loved the child, Isabel. It is so refreshing to read of a 12 year old who has good manners, grammar and a large vocabulary. The way she uses ""like"" keeps her within the limits of her age! Our Renoir lady, heroine, grows stronger, wiser and more confident as we read of her travails. I read The Betrayal as slowly and deliberately as possible, though the temptation to rush was compelling. It is a book to savor, which I did. Well done, Sabin. Hopefully, you have another book in progress."
4,"The evil side of Washington, DC","Another winner from Sabin Willett. Great writing, great characters, great storyline. You want Louisa to succeed all the way in her quest to prove her innocence. This book will give you a great background on the TRUE inside Washington politics and make you wonder if things like this actually do happen. Something tells me that it does.This is a great weekend on the beach read with a pitcher of Long Island Iced Teas...get lost in this book!"
5,Very Entertaining,A great thriller with a lot of twists and turns. Entertaining enough to allow you to make the leaps of faith necessary to be engrossed in it. I loved The Deal as well. I can't wait for his next one.
5,Essential for Huysmans fans,"Even though this book was published 50 years ago, it is still a core source for anyone interested in this very important writer, particularly for those of us who don't read French. (It should be noted though that this book has also appeared in a French translation.) Baldick, who also translated at least one Huysmans novel (Against Nature), covers the entire life in clear prose, dealing with the author's faults and struggles, though also clearly sympathetic to his subject. There is an index, notes and a list of Huysmans' published works as well as some black and white illustrations. Readers should note that this book has been recently reissued in the UK, so they may want to check Amazon.uk."
4,Good Material,For some time I was looking for good reading material for project management and thought a friend reference I purchased this book last year.At this moment I'm using most of the techniques described in the book and actually they works for me!.The practical guidelines help lot in day-to-day project planning scenarios and management of projects.This book is out of the traditional theoretical manner and I could recommend this for any body who would like to improve their skills on better project management.
3,Decent....,"This is D.R.I.'s 3rd full length. This is where D.R.I. try to market themselves as a ""crossover"" band fusing punk and metal. If thrash metal is your cup of tea then you'll love the low-fi sound comparable to a lot of bands on this label at the time. If you're more into punk, I would say this would probably be the last D.R.I. record you'd want to get. The songs average 1:30 - 2 minute and decent song writing. I personally think the production of this is too muffled and what makes this a medicore record. I guess what I'm saying as a 16 year D.R.I. fan the production on this is like no other D.R.I. record and not in a good way. Lyrics on songs like ""coffin"" and ""go die"" show D.R.I. trying to be more of a metal band and stray from social political lyrics that Kurt Brecht is known for writing. Again, I'm a 30 year old more into punk/hardcore and songs about telling your ""fans"" to ""go die"" is sorta rock star-ish and stupid."
3,crossover......bad idea.,"buying this album,rushing home to play it....deadly silence,have i bought the wrong record,afraid not.it is so diverse from dealing with it,why change a winning team.anyway if crossover had been d.r.i.s first release people would be saying not bad at all.the power is there with some speedy,catchy tunes.if you like thrash then this is for you..."
4,very good,"This is an introduction to the ideas of Claude Levi-Strauss, who wrote some truly seminal books. I could compare him to Jared Diamond, in a wayCollapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition, for example. I don't agree with everything he says, however, he basically formed a large part of anthropological thought, and had influence far beyond what one might expect. Worth the read."
2,Overpriced,"While this book does offer an introduction to Levi-Strauss, it's quite short and not worth the price. (I paid $7.67 for the kindle version. Really, it's only worth about $4.00, if that!) Quite disappointing."
3,A VERY SLOW READ.,"It was very difficult for my students to sit through this book. It was PACKED full of useful information on many different women, but didn't have much of an overall story to keep the listeners interested. It went from woman to woman to woman, teling about each life story and accomplishment. It caused the children to think divergently. The storyline was touched upon briefly, mostly at the beginning and at the end. Personally, I liked this book because I enjoy black history. However, I do not advise reading this book to a large group of small children."
1,not happy with ending,"I purchased this book for my 2 girls hoping that it would be a great resource of info on African American women. However, after reading the story myself, I had to return the book. The author had the young girl falling in love with her adopted cousin - stating on the last page how they were going to marry and have children. Both of my children are adopted and I can't imagine the confusion and questions they would have about this. I am saddened that the author has chosen to portray adoption so poorly."
4,a good quality b&b product,"This product is great. It's not crunchy or stiff and doesn't even look like something's in my hair. It helps maintain that just-finished-blow-drying volume for an all day look. As its not a hair spray, it doesn't have that strong of a hold. I found it a lot more effective when I had shoulder length hair. Now that my hair is a good 7-8 inches past my shoulder, it doesn't hold up the volume like it used too-- probably just from the weight of my hair alone.After blow drying my hair every day for years prior to using this product, and everyday after finding this product, I can definitely verify that it has protected my hair from a lot of damage. Its been almost six months since my last haircut and I barely have any split ends! and no dry tips!"
2,Not so good...,Seaweed conditioner is good but the lotion is not all that good. I read the ingredients on the bottle I bought. Rosemary and other herbs was listed first. So I thought it would be ok for me spray more. It appears to me that the makers of this product kept the acrylics and alcohols hidden from in its contents. My hair felt stiff with less shine.
4,babychanel,i love this styling lotion it make my hair shine and softand i relax my hair bc i love it the coco crema lotion >
1,Absolutely ineffective for my type of hair.,"I think that each product works for a different type of person or hair, and this turned out to be the case with this line of product that has an unbelievably good reputation, especially here in CA. Sorry, not for me. I found it ineffective and totally taking away whatever little volume my hair had. Oh well, I tried. Will not purchase again."
1,Does Not Fit !,"Do not purchase the 3pc billet grille for a 2009 Nissan Frontier, it does not fit.The front end on the 2009 was slightly redesigned with smaller openings.Buyer beware."
4,Great Author!,"This is the third book by Arnold S. Goldstein I have purchased. This book is labeled EZ for a reason, the content is very easy to understand. I would recommend his older book The Guarenteed Credit guide also as it has a little more indepth content.Jeremy"
1,Horrible Book,This book does not tell you much other than the obvious and is really for people who have very minor credit problems the title is a little misleading.
2,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","Good - tells you how to show for credit by being professional, researching and asking the right questions and starting at the local level.Bad - Incorrect material. 1- The FTC can represent an individual consumer in litigation. 2- Credit bureaus are not obligated to honor a consumer's request to be removed from pre-approved lists. 3 - credit bureaus score credit files. 4 - Removal of a tax lien cannot be reinserted. 5 - Bounced checks do not appear on credit reports. All of this is wrong and the list goes on. Too many errors to list here.Ugly - the book accuses credit repair companies of taking advantage of consumers ignorance but this book is also advancing at the expense of consumers lack of understanding or knowledge by providing erroneous information to the masses.More time should have been spent researching the facts."
1,Mismatched Mikasa,"I own a complete 5-piece service for 8 of Mikasa Parchment and decided to get an extra cup and saucer (separate orders needed). The cup does not match the set I own. The white is a different shade, and the shape of the base of the cup is rounder. I didn't know there could be ""variations on a theme"" when it came to china. I am returning this."
4,"No Masterpiece, But Good Stuff","Naive and Sentimental Music is not the masterpiece that Harmonielehre is. Although they employ similar orchestral forces and have similar compositional structures, the former doesn't reach the kind of tension or exuberance that the latter achieves. Nevertheless, there's also a lot of beautiful music here, and if you're a fan of John Adams you will probably find this piece worthwhile."
3,"Good, but needs more","This is a good book if you are interested in how Wicca is growing in the U.S. and the concerns of modern day wiccans. The first chapter is a quick summary of wiccan beliefs and sabbats, etc. But the rest of the book really has nothing to say about wiccan beliefs. The rest of the book deals with covens, community, and how Wicca is a postmodern religion. Overall, its a good book if you're interested in the theology of Wicca, otherwise (especially if you're looking for a book to use for practicing and learning wicca) it needs a lot more."
3,not hutton.,"This book tries, and fails, to pick up where Hutton leaves off. Not a bad work, and certainly valuable and written in acessible langauge, but the scope of the investigation was too narrow to have much external validity."
4,"CLOSE, BUT NOT A RINGER","This is a thorough and helpful book in understanding the development of Wicca in America from its European immigration. But actually therein lies the problem as, once again I discover, it is difficult to find detailed historical documentation on the ancient roots of the Old Religion. Since the late sixties, and in conjunction with the feminist movement, it appears that emphasis continues to be taken away from the equal duality of God representing both sexes through symbolistic ritual instead of the Goddess slant that is continually stressed. I understand the religious persecution of woman over the milleneum and tend to side with them on this issue, but hijacking the Wiccan religion to spearhead a Female Goddess movement is not the way to balance the scale."
4,Pretty Damn Good,Ok i ordered this cd and their first release from Metal Blade Records (Frail Words Collapse). They both sound somewhat the same. There really isnt much innovation between the two. They do have some nice break downs but the rythems seem to sound somewhat repeditive. I have seen these guys live and they put on an amazing show. There just one of those bands that dont sound that great on a cd but live they rate as one of the best bands ive seen. I think both cds are worth a listen. Frail Words Collapse is more for the grind/thrash fans it seems to have a little rougher sound and some faster rythems. If you like Mastadon or the new Killswitch Engage cd then Shadows and Security is for you.
3,A bit overated,"Shadows are Security is a solid, well-made album, but is a bit overated. The musicians are talented. The music is heavy, yet melodic and catchy. The sound quality (the way the music is recorded) sounds great. And I can see why the band is popular amongst young people. However, the music lacks in variety. The songs seem to be played in the same key, with the same type of riffs for each song. And although the drummer is talented, he reuses similar beats over and over. The band seems to be a prisoner of its own sound, almost unable to think outside their own box. I get the feeling that the band's best material is yet to come."
1,the power of christ impales you,"hmmm. christian metal, isn't that an oxymoron? or just moronic? i believe that foucault would have said it best that crap like this would still stink even if you don't call it crap. this is definetely for fans of GAO and the ilk. i would also make comparisons to poison and motely crue's lighter stuff. talentless triggered drums over open E after open E with all the hair and glam metal that you can stand. may also fit well with judas priest, but oops, they would probably hate him being that he is gay and all. lyrics will make the buddy christ proud though and may win over some dashboard likers. hot topic will gladly take your mall purchase. i heard they're going to exhume the pope for the next tour. rock on. origin/ echoes of decimation slays this. death to false metal and all of its prophets."
1,what a waste,"Okay, word of warning: this is a christian band, not that anyone could possibly understand their lyrics anyway.All the songs sound exactly the same, with preachy christian lyrics. Eww.Really, 'nuff said."
2,Very generic metalcore.,"This is a very boring album that could have been so much better. The vocalist is very talented but the whole album sounds the same. This band is much like It Dies Today, and sounds a tad like Trivium. Frail Words to Colapse is a much better album and has MUCH more creativity. The guitar riffs in SAS are very generic, although if you like the sound it will suit you. I would recomend bands such as, The Black Dahlia Murder, Darkest Hour, and Lamb of God instead of this band. The whole metalcore genre is going downhill and is all sounding the same."
3,"Not bad, I guess.","If you liked Frail Words Collapse, You'll like this. Why? Because it's basically the same album, except it almost has an Atreyu feel. It's not quite as heavy as FWC, but it basically follows the same patterns thier last album did.It's good to listen to every now and then, You can impress your friends by predicting exactly what the drums are going to do, since it sounds like they pretty much just rearranged the drums from the last album. If you were looking from something new and exciting from As I Lay Dying, look elsewhere.They've got a solid and distinctive ""sound"" to them, though, Which I can't say anything bad about. They just need some new ideas.If you've never heard As I Lay Dying before, pick this up, you'll love it.If you have heard As I Lay Dying before, this is a solid album, but it's also a ""safe"" album. Not too much creativity here. Their lyrics suck, as usual, but that's not what As I Lay Dying is about."
5,Awesome,"Great cd!! This is in my opinion AILD's best cd ever. the voacls are amazing and the guitars are like i've never heard before. one of the best medal bands there is. the lyrics are great also, very spiritual and a big improvement in that respect"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Man this band keeps getting worse and worse. i can't understand why people get into crap like this. this band sounds like every other crappy metal-core band out there.the riffs are jus annoying enough too make you deaf or bored outta your damn mind.this totally has no balls and falls in such a trendy sound that if you heard one metal-core band, youve heard them all.TOTAL CRAP!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! you have been warned"
3,"4 stars, but for some reason it won't let me change it from 3 stars","Okay, we all know Tim doesn't have the ""prettiest"" voice in the world. If you can get past that, the music is some of the best I've heard, and the lyrics are like poetry. I wouldn't consider it screamo (my friends do), but I guess it's not just metal. They're not really like Atreyu (an example of screamo) and, say, Metallica or something. But the bottom line is, these guys are good. Tim will probably need throat surgery in a few years, but until then, they'll continue to be a great band I'm sure."
2,2 stars just to be modest,"Well first off I got this album probably because of the overhypeness it got from magazines, the internet, radio and TV and living in southern California this band was hyped enough so I listened to the first single Meaning in Tragedy and I thought,Ehh, not bad. So then a friend gave me a burned copy and thats when I thought to myself, ""Is this supposed to be a concept album?"" I ask that simply because the lead singer, sang in the same monotone growl on the entire album, the guitar work had the same chords the entire album and mostly all the songs practically sound the same. Its very hard to distinguish from track to track, only if you listen to this cd all day you will be able to tell the diffenrence. Probably,the only thing that made me not give it a 1 star was, the drumming and the song Confined but just download that song instead. Overall this album is not what it was cracked up to be."
1,"Remember Limp BIzkit?? This is them, updated.","Yeah, remember korn?? Slipknot?? As I lay CRYING is no different. I don't even have to right a review, the crappy music speaks for itself.oh yeah, please don't ever compare this trash to In Flames!"
5,Outstanding!,"My favorite record by As I Lay Dying. The songs flow together to form a clean cut journey, lyrical themes sustained throughout the record. Shadows Are Security features heavy guitar sounds with melodic guitar workings and harmonization. Definitely a work of art to come highly recommended!"
3,As I Lay Dying - 'Shadow Are Security' (Metal Blade),"Review no. 161 - San Diego grindcore metal band's third CD. This was my first listen to this h-e-a-v-y duty ensemble. I even saw them recently out on tour. Maybe not my favorite genre these days, but I was somewhat impressed with what I heard. Couple of the major draws here include ""Darkest Nights"", ""Repeating Yesterday"", the ultra-riff heavy ""Control Is Dead"" and ""Morning Waits"". Fans of At The Gates, Unearth, God Forbid, Lamb Of God and Hatebreed will most likely get the most out of this CD - or any of their other titles. Turn this on UP!"
2,Pseudo-Sophmore Slump,"Well what can I say? Frail Words Collapse was beautiful, albeit nothing particularly new, and the latest effort, An Ocean Between Us is a scorchingly brilliant comeback. Beneath the Encasing of Ashes had its merits as well. But this...I have little to say. Shadows Are Security is bland, boring, poorly produced, and an utter failure. I find it unfortunate that two good tracks, Confined and Illusions, have to stand alone on this teetering heap. Other than that, the album is completely devoid of any real feeling or talent. Do yourself and skip this one."
5,Shadows Are Security,"Shadows Are Security is As I Lay Dying's second album from Metal Blade Records. Just as in the previous album, Frail Words Collapse, this one contains Intense metalcore breakdowns with ferrocious screams. But this time around they added some singing to freshen up the music a bit. All that and they still manage to send a positive message with spiritual, beatuifully written lyrics. I would recomend buying Frail Words Collapse first to get the feel for this awesome band.xx"
4,God Rock SUCKS,"...but I'll throw some kudos to the As I Lay Dying boys for this one. Three cheers for harmony in metal core. No, seriously... I mean it."
4,Repetative,"AS I LAY DYING did pretty good on this album. i like every song on it, but...its too repatative. they repeat so many riffs. on their last one, FRAIL WORDS COLLAPSE, they barely repeated a riff, now the whole song just cycles through 4 riffs or so. other than that, i luv the breakdowns, and the mood of the music. whick is why i give it a 4 out of 5."
4,"Some people love it, others hate it","Frail Words Collapse was the first album by As I Lay Dying that I heard. I pretty much loved it so when their newest album, Shadows Are Security, came out, I immidatly went out and bought it. I got home and listened to the first track. Wow, I was blown away. The music was fast and hard and very catchy. I was hooked right away. But the more I listened to it, the more I noticed the screaming. It was more like a deep, incomprehensible growl ... compared to their last album, which was some good normal screaming. Personaly, im not a big fan of low or deep screaming so this album only earned 4 out of 5 stars. Other than that, I completly recomend that you buy it now."
4,How can you say this is...poppy?,"They got harder. Live with it. The vocalist actually learning how to sing in my mind is the highlight of the album. Check out the single Confined: amist all of the blast beats and rawness, somehow he manages to make a catchy hook -Lyrics are still pretty lame, hence four stars, but heck you can't understand most of the time what he's saying anyway"
1,Trendy and over used...,"As i lay dying 's "" shadows are security"" basically sounds like every other mallcore band and its so depressing and idk why i even try giving this slipknot wanna be real metal generation a chance !"
1,This was already done by IN FLAMES,Check out WHORACLE by IN FLAMES. It sounds like the album you should have bought rather than this bland metal/emo-core.
4,heavy,"This is good! Double-bass are massive and all the way in the foreground, almost covering up the guitars at certain points, but the production is so well crafted, that the danger of muddy blur is escaped. Wonderfull riffs and changes in rythm, that keeps comming.I find it relieving, that so much energy backs up a positive aproach to the world and the God almighty. It is a good sign that metal no longer needs to kneel to the childiss evil-kaneevil of the metalscene of my youth in the 80's.As I lay dying is a fine example because it contains all the power and thunder that makes this genre so full of life."
3,"Well, they ain't Trivium but...",I don't have all of As I Lay Dying's albums. This is the first I picked up (there is just so much metal out there I don't have time to listen to it all - though I would like to). I liked it alot. It took a few listens until it really grew on me though. These guys are playing hard and heavy and do a damn good job of it. I don't know In Flames or alot of other 'metal core' bands so I don't have any comparisons in my head. All I know is that this is a good album. The guitar harmonizing is a nice touch but solos would have added much needed depth to the album over all. If you don't have so much newer metal laying around give this album a chance... you might like it. If you have evey new metal album out there then you'll probably fall into the rut of comparing this band to bands like In Flames or similar bands. But if you are looking for a true gem of new metal pick up Trivium's Ascendency (and Trivium's the Crusade when it comes out).
4,Good stuff!,"I just received this disc today - I'm MAD that I've never heard of these guys before! I am very pleased with this purchase. If you like Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth, Living Sacrifice, Soul Embraced, or newer In Flames, you may very well enjoy this. No wild solos or viking references, but some pretty nice lead parts and lyrics that question why we're so content with the crap that we live with every day when there's such a larger, collective picture. Vocal quality is not bad at all, and some decent singing. Nice aggressive riffs/rhythms and good chord progressions combine underneath some lead parts that sound arch enemy-ish.If you're a Christian or a Metal Head, I highly recommend this album!"
4,Sidney Poitier Fan!!,I had never seen this movie but saw the remake with Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed this movie a little boring because a message was being made when this movie came out. The acting was wonderful and if you watch you'll notice there wasn't much music in this movie either. All in all I loved it. Must have if you are a fan of old movies; Poitier fan.
3,Pleasant.,"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a good film but not as good as everyone has said. This film does have many flaws, the plot line is dated and pretentious. What makes this film work is the incredible acting, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn show their colorful range and depth, amazing! Sidney Poitier is a treasure as well. Important message but if this film was made today, it would be totally different."
4,I'm coming to dinner,"Bad music, carnivorism (I'm a vegetarian), and a sachrine-sweet atmosphere. So what makes this movie so great? It's wake-up call to anyone who still thinks interracial relationships are taboo. Seriously though, it sets a good message despite the dude being about 15 years older, it's hillarious (especially the dance scene with the maid's assistant and the deli delivery boy), and Katharine Houghton is NOT a bad actress, despite what others may say. I think she plays her over-enthusiastic character quite well.This review is not sarcasm, I assure you. No, I don't support the killing of animals, but that's such a small part of the story (turtle soup and deli) that it's hardly worth mentioning. A great move made in a time of racial turmoil. This may have even inspired the kiss between Captain Kirk and Communications Officer O'Hura."
4,An interesting look back,"1967 doesn't seem that long ago until you see this movie. An interracial couple (gasp!).Anyway, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn can't make a bad movie, so even if this film drops into cliches every once in a while, it's still wonderful.But one question: Why is Poitier's character so much more educated, introspective and deep than his boring financee? I'd be telling Poitier, look, honey, you can do a lot better. You don't need to settle for this uninteresting waif."
5,so good,this movie was so good!! they just don't make movies like this anymore..The message was strong and the points were made...
3,"You don't own me, man!","While Poitier gave an exceptional performance, Spencer Tracy's end of the movie monolgue was one of the best 2 minute speeches in film history. Knowing his illness and probably, pending death, you can see Hepburn wobble in her real tears. While not a big Hepburn fan, that one moment is worth the entire picture."
1,dissapointed,"Ordered DVD but recieved VHS after numerous attempts to return it i was unable to get correct information, shipping label and to return it now i am stuck with a movie that will never be seen and i feel ripped off. I will not order from Amazon again due to the return policy and lack of avaliability to contact you."
1,I'm so discusted with Amazon,"I ordered this as a gift and had it sent directly to someone. They received a USED DVD! Plainly marked USED on a sticker on the DVD, not sealed, not in a box, NOT NEW! I didn't see anywhere on Amazon that it wasn't new."
1,Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,Great movie! It is obvious that the love expressed by K. Hepburn & S. Tracy in their last film together is real.
2,No return?,I found out that I mistakely ordered a VHS. I do not have a VCR at home. I e-mailed the seller the next day. He said he mailed it and he refused to take it back.
2,A dinner I don't mind missing...,"Maybe it's a case of needing to be there but I hated this movie! Yes...HATED! What a waste of my time.The token Hollywood Negro of the time chides his father with his -blah! blah! ""I am a black man speech"". Whatever. Does being a doctor give him a free pass against the reality of race? This movie assumes so.Maybe it's the time period but this movie tried too hard.I guess it was supposed to be an enlightening and daring look at inter-racial mating with the ""correct"" type of Negroe male hooking up with a white girl. Oh My!It was nauseating. It is celebration of false social pretense and bogus racial harmony.I realize Mr. Poiter is the sacred cow of ""black"" acting. I have never enjoyed any of his work. He always comes across as a long suffering yet strangely noble Negroe in every role. It's an Uncle Tom has gone to Hollywood type of display."
2,OK For Its Time,"I guess this was an importabt movie when it came out, but when I saw it, it seemed a bit dated. Your daughter want so marry Mr. Perfect, so what's the problem. This wouldn't be an issue to me or to many other people nowadays, but it was apparently more loaded in the 20th century when race tensions were not quite as relaxed as they are now. Tracey and hepburn do a great job of portraying a very liberal minded couple whos convictions are finally put to the test, and Poitier does an excellent job of being every woman's dream fiance, but I still thought it was fairly dull. A sign of progress, maybe?"
2,"Shallow, foolish, contrived",Silly plot played out in cliches. Preachy and moralistic in a pre-cursor to 90's facile political correctness. A waste of Hepburn and Tracy. Right in line with Poitier's career.
5,The beginning of a new era.,The acting in this movie is fantastic. Hepburn and Tracy are always great together as they play off one another to create a believable relationship. (They both will be sorely missed.) The subject of an interracial relationship as shown in this film was ahead of its time and very well written. Who would have thought that this type of relationship would eventually become ordinary?
2,You get what you pay for.,The bottle is so cheap looking and the cologne is just as cheap. Synthetic foul smelling cologne is defintely not for me.
4,Nice...,"This cologne smells nice on my husband. I am very picky about colognes. I can't stand those colognes for men that smell flowery, fruity or overbearing. This cologne has a subtle yet manly fragrance. It makes a nice gift."
2,Ceasar's Man Cologne scent doesn't last,"The scent of Caesar's Man Cologne doesn't last . Every time I smell it on someone else it smells real good . Every time I use it, the scent doesn't last. I would have expected that from an after shave but not from a cologne."
3,Alright - not as good as I hoped for,"I read reviews before I bought this and it seemed like a great cologne; cheap, good reviews. Well I got it today, and it's alright I guess. When you first spray it, it's very strong. Yet after a few minutes, I can barely even smell it. It smells alright, nothing spectacular, just seems to be either too strong or to light. I wouldn't buy this product again.On the plus side, the seller of this item was great, my item shipped next day and I received it after three days."
2,Not Exactly Deaf/HoH Friendly,"I originally purchased this DVD because it was supposed to be subtitled. No subtitles or closed-captioning to be found (I told Amazon.com to change the description).And to make things ""worst"" for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the screen shot focuses on several areas rather than the whole body view.Wish I could comment on the content of the video, but really can't if I couldn't follow the movements and instructions.I wouldn't suggest the Caribbean Workout series for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing."
1,much noise,"There are too much noise in this DVD, so I can not see. Very bad.I should not have purchased.I will never buy from Amazon."
4,Good Protection,The I-Pod skins are fairly difficult to get on. Once it is on the skin does provide good protection.
1,LATE SHIPPING,"I ordered this item in July and they delayed my order 3 times. I finally decided to cancel because I did not get my item when I needed it anyways. By the time they got delaying my order (that again was placed in mid-July) I was going to get it between September 30-October 4th. And that is if they did not delay it again. It sounds like a great deal though, I hope other customers get to have it. What would have been courtious of the company is if they had at least apologized or said something themselves! Amazon sent the apology. I did not hear at all from the company. Major thumbs down, and I am a person that has never complained about a company mistake. This was almost just rude."
4,Good Deal,"I have a 20 GB ipod, and the case is skin tight, but easy enough to get on. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND SOMEONE WITH A 40 GB IPOD TO BUY THIS CASE- That kind of ipod is larger, and would simply not fit the dimensions of the case. Otherwise, it provides easy access to the click wheel, and to the ports for the headphones, dock, etc. It is stylish, and I think that three of them for 23 dollars (right now there's a discount) is an extemely good deal, given that some ipod cases cost up to 40 dollars apiece. If you're planning on buying this, please note that these cases offer no protection to the screen- although I knew that they wouldn't when I bought it, the screen is a highly scratchable surface. I really like the case overall, but I do king of miss the shiny beauty of the ipod without the case on."
4,"Overall good, great price!",Pros:good protectionVery cheapAttractivethin/lightCons:hard to put in pocket w/ case oniTrip doesn't fit in the top very well without some struggling
5,FAILURES FOR GODS IS A MASTERPIECE,"Great follow up to the 1996 Here In After CD. All the songs are killer and the lyrics,and song names are too. Great CD cover and back. The production is dark,and brutal but could be a tad bit better,im still happy with the release. Its still IMMOLATION by all means. Pick it up while you can its going out of print I heard from anohter metalhead on ebay."
4,Immolation is Back!,"This is a completly brutal, christian hating spew of awesome death metal. Rivals Malevolent Creation/Morbid Angel in intensity. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the production of the drums is slightly lacking. But that is no reason to have this! Just watch your possessions when you start banging to this!!"
2,Come On Now!,"Although intelligently written and acted, this film operates on two huge misconceptions: 1. A woman must debase herself in order to love and be loved. 2. There's a woman alive who can't be brought to pleasure by Rocco Siffreddi.Get real!"
2,Sex does not equate with sexy,"Perhaps it is the poor dubbing; maybe if I spoke French I could get into this film better. This DVD essentially centers around a woman who has plenty of sex, but little enjoyment from sex. She is deeply in love with a many who will not make love. As the DVD went on, I had a greater empathy for the cat in the latter scene than I did any of the characters. This movie seems emotionally drained but perhaps those involved in aberrant behavior will get insight from this movie. This certainly is not a feel good movie and I have seen better from the director. The real gripe I have is that the poor dubbing detracts from everything even if the mood is not upbeat."
1,The most boring movie I have ever seen,"This movie is not erotic at all. It is slow and boring. The most erotic part of the package is the picture on the box. I don't recommend it to anyone who has something better to do, like watching soap operas.Sorry about it, Amazon, nothing personal. But I am dissapointed that I bought this movie, watched it once, and WILL throw it in the trash. I suggest Amazon provide a better way for us to find movies on its site. Unfortunately all the reviews I read about this movie were completely wrong. ""An Eyeful"" what a joke. Teaches me a lesson: don't trust what is written in the back of the boxes."
2,No date movie,"Do not be misled by the cover statements re:sexiness or eroticism. This is a nihilistic, stereotyping, sexist, film. It is an infantile and simplistic representation about the basicness of the female/male sexual enmeshment that spins the cycle of creation/destruction. While it does provoke discussion, in the end it is as intellectually and emotionally unsatisfying as a blank piece of paper that is presented as a minimalistic novel. If you've been depressed and comtemplating suicide, this one may send you on your way. By all means, do not watch this with your lover; it will put you off sex for days, or at least hours."
1,Disfunctional Gobblygook,"One of the worse films I have ever viewed. The husband's character is unbelievable. The female lead is somewhat believable, but tedious and boring. There are lots of beautiful scenes and beautiful bodies, so visually it is extremely well done. There are not many films I can say that I hate, but this one is very close. I love foreign films, films with an edge but this was not interesting to me in any way. I feel robbed of my time and my money."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This movie is all talk and no action. The protagonist, Marie, is an unsympathetic person. you never care what happens to her. The film promises eroticism but never delivers. If you want to see a movie about sexual decadence and obsession, then rent or buy In The Realm of the Senses."
2,Censored!,"Do NOT buy the VHS version of this film if you want to see the film that Catherine Breillat intended to make. It is cut, edited, in other words, censored. It's not just that the graphic sex scenes are cut and that much can be left to the imagination; it's that the cuts eviscerate the film. Breillat made the film in anger, and her anger is most evident in the explicit sexual scenes that were cut. What's left is drivel.I plan to ship it back for a refund."
1,Heavily edited,"I saw this movie at a film festival, and it was intended to drive home a point by shocking the viewer. A woman is upset by the lack of love she is recieving from her boyfriend so she looks elsewhere, and gets herself into a few uncomfortable situations. There are some graphic sex scenes which are a little bit unsettling.The version available here is so heavily edited (an entire scene that is crucial to the plot is missing, and others are zoomed in to avoid nudity) that you will fail to see the point the film is trying to make. Skip it."
2,Shockingly Immature,"I first wanted to see ""Romance"" when it was released as ""the most explicit French film in along time"". The characters talk as if they were profound and enlightening, but it all comes off as rather annoying. If you do decide to check out this film, however, DO NOT get the ""R"" rated version. It cuts out 14 minutes from the original, and those sequences are badly edited out. Overall, this is a mildly amusing glance into the pathetic life of a woman."
5,Watch the movie to learn about female pleasure and sexuality,"The whole story would help us learn about the silent truth of female pleasure and sexuality. The plot, director, actors and wonderful actress in overall are much more better than other explicit sex movies such as ""Lie With Me"" and, especially, ""Intimacy."""
1,What the....?,"Would a little French soft porn turn you on? Then this flick is NOT for you, unless of course you enjoy rape scenes, endless gynecological exam scene, extreme close-ups of a (...) birth, and the like. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to get this type of ""art"". Kinda glad I'm not.I feel dirty."
1,Wasted $,"This is far from Romance...that's money I'll never get back, not to mention wasted time...I'm going to toss this one in the trash...I should have just put the money in the trash and at least saved myself some time."
1,"Sad, Just Sad","I don't know WHY this movie is titled 'Romance', because there ISN'T ANY! Maybe that's why.This seems to be made by someone who has given up. Given up on love, given up on life, given up on themself.The main character spoke of herself in the MOST negative and demeaning terms and language.The way she let herself be treated by her lover and other men made me wonder why she let herself continue to pursue such empty relationships.The story is sad, both in emotion and style.The acting was mediocre at best.The dialogue was shallow and phoney. The film quality itself is the only saving grace, as it was very good, it is the ONLY reason I gave it even ONE star.I watched this with my girlfriend and we both agree it was a waste of time. More than once we thought about just stopping it, but kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has any sense of hope and joy in their life, nor to anyone who doesn't."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Romance is unfortunately notable only for its graphic sex, for Breillat has not come up with a compelling story to go along with the taboo-shattering scenes; if you want to see the provocative French director use her skills to a point and purpose, watch Fat Girl instead."
1,I found it...tiresome....,"My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French. In English, its unbearable.Slow? At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes."
3,How do you spell relief? R-o-m-a-n-c-e.,"I got relief in about ten minutes, by fast-forwarding, then slow-motioning thru this hot, hot flik. I can't really speak as to the quality of the ""story"", as I was not following the story at all, but rather following the ""action"". I will say the dame seems a bit too chatty and sad and silly, like most dames in films of this ilk, who most pose pensive and over-intellectual to avoid the censor's lash. I can't predict when really good erotica will hit the screen, but Catherine Breullait & others have at least made a halfway decent stab at it. What's required is a really good second-rate writer of the quality of Somerset Maugham. Someone intelligent, sensitive, cheerfully evil and unencumbered by the typical delusions."
2,Slow and Boring,"This move dragged on and on. There was very little action at all. There were often scenes where there was no conversation or action of any sort except for walking, or dancing, or just starring off into space. The movie was poorly directed, and the plot was thin. The director did not develop the characters well at all, and you never feel as if you know them at all. Even the sex scenes don't save it. The only thing that saves this film from getting only one star is the ending, which was a bit of a surprise. I would not recommend this film at all, unless you don't have anything else to do."
1,Buyer Beware - Not What's Advertised,"Don't know why my first note hasn't appeared, so I'll briefly restate. the claim-to-fame of this film is it's avant-garde, push-the-envelope sexuality. Amazon describes this film as ""Unrated"", but that's not what nearly all of these listings are selling. These are the new ""R"" Rated version that is MASSIVELY redacted. In fact, all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity. Even though the box continues to bill it as ""The sexiest movie ever made."" On top of that, despite an English only cover, my VHS purchase was subtitled in SPANISH. The seller has offered an adjustment. He didn't know. But Amazon needs to drop the 'Unrated' description, as that implies the original. Those still interested might look for something like a 'director's cut'. I still haven't found one. Sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post."
5,The other side of Love,"This is a pretty amazing movie, that does get graphic in nature and crosses the line in parts of what is art and what is not. Very good story in which Caroline Ducey goes out looking for love when her boyfriend, Sagamore Stevenin refuses to pay any attention to her. Caroline's character finds love in many different forms, men and means. From picking up a lover at a bar (Rocco Siffredi), to finding an older man into S&M, to having a quickie on a set of stairs by a total stranger (which I think is the best segment). A great film from Catherine Breillat. Also check out her 2003 masterpiece, 'Anatomy of Hell', which also stars Rocco Siffredi."
2,For women.,"This movie has excellent cinematography in the first half. (the beach, the apartment) Other than that the script is really bad. The main female character's ponderings on how men treat women are misguided. She is basically troubled and needs to get help. Her boyfriend is causing her great emotional pain, by refusing any sexual contact, but that is also her problem, she should leave him, he provides nothing for her. The sex is amazingly BORING, there is no passion, no atmosphere, no intensity, and no love. Its not a terrible movie or a classified B-movie, but it is not written well. It could have been better if the script provided deeper insights on the main character and allowed her more freedom to break out of her misery and just get a new life. She is only falling down a dark spiral trying to find out if sex can give her the love her boyfriend can not give to her. This movie really kills your libido."
3,I don't know what the fuss is all about?,"After seeing this movie on DVD, I was a little disappointed in it, the story line is good, the acting at times seems forced, but then the subject matter is sometimes overwhelming. They are a few scenes it that almost denied it a release here in Australia, but finally our censors saw the light and have let it be seen."
2,Not Worth A Rental,This movie is a tedious monologue interrupted by some fairly explict sex scenes which are clinically presented (it's one of the points of the film) and whose novelty quickly wears thin. Stay away from this one.
2,The most Unerotic Hardcore you'll see...,"For all its explicit sex, ""Romance"" is a very very cold film. The problem lies in the fact that the star of the film spends 90% of the time discussing the meaning of sex and love during the explicit scenes that it becomes a complete turn off. But what I found more annoying about this film is that it is supposed to be about the liberation of a woman through her sexuality, yet the heroine constantly allows herself to be humiliated. This is not liberation...it is self-loathing. Proceed with caution on this one, it is not for everyone..."
4,Romance,Highly Erotic.....very edgy. More skin in it than an NC17. Not a date movie! Something for a couple to read together.
2,Poor Excuse For Romance,"Regrettably, Romance is a disappointment. If you are looking for an ""adult"" film that is both titillating and thought provoking, this movie will fall short on both. There is nothing romantic about the movie, the sex scenes may be explicit when compared to an ""R"" rated movie, but many PG-13 movies are ""sexier"" than Romance."
4,SHOCKING!! No scruples here!,"This is the finished product when you combine ""Wings of Desire"", ""Clerks"", and an XXX flick all together. French flick about a woman who just can't ""get it"" from lover/hubby and ends up doing (and dreaming up) some really off the wall erotica(?) (hmm...) I wouldn't play this flick for my daughter even if she were 21!! VERY SHOCKING! Beware!"
2,Basic and non updated,"This book was written 1n 1993.... even though the basics remain the same, there are other books on the subjet like the ones written by Myra Savant-Harris that are 100% more updated."
3,Not enough info!,"This book was helpful,but I didn't feel like it went into detail enough on problems that a bitch might have while whelping,and what the trouble signs are to look for."
2,HELP WANTED: COMPETENT EDITOR !!!,"I enjoyed reading this book because it provided good information regarding the Marianas Campaign. There seem to be comparatively few books written on the Marianas operations, considering its overall strategic importance in the Pacific Theater.However, I have never read a book with as many typos and grammatical errors. I agree with previous reviewers that the Civil War military analogies are way over done. The writing style in some instances was like pulp fiction. No flowery fluff is required to convey the dangers faced and courage exihibited by these servicemen.The frequency of errors increased in the latter portion of the book. It reminded me of my college term papers .... no time for proof reading!!!!"
3,rocks hard,"but needs to rock harder. TITD's new grind album. tear it up. steve's vocals SHREEEAK on this one, he's one pissed off MF. it shows on this one. very emotive. can't wait to hear their next one with the direction they took w/ this release."
3,"Good, but not their best","The latest release from Today Is The Day, while strong on intensity and rage, seems to lack the depth of previous releases such as 'In The Eyes of God' and 'Temple Of The Morning Star.' This is slightly understandable; their previous release, the 2-disc 'Sadness Will Prevail' is hard to top. That said, 'Kiss The Pig' is definitely a solid release with plenty of the crushing riffs that their fans have grown used to - it just seems to fall short of the typical madness that surrounds a TITD disc. However, anyone who has seen them live can attest to the genius of Steve Austin - no doubt these songs will transition quite well to the stage."
3,High Potential/Low Production,"Okay, this is my first taste of TITD so forgive me if I've offended some hardcore TITD fans. As I state in the title, this band gives me the feeling that previous albums were kick a-- however Kiss The Pig in my opinion falls short. I really blame the production for my lack of enjoyment here. The muffled sound of the instruments gives no justice to the talent behind them. The screams are awesome and unique from any other band though. Too bad they drown out the music that is already hard to distinguish. I also understand if the band wanted to keep a raw feeling to the album but thats not my taste. I believe if you're going to release an album you should put effort into the production because the real talent of playing the instruments is then lost somehow. I'll keep my ears drawn for the next release and maybe dip into there past albums because I'm not totally dismissing this band."
4,WARNING!! proceed w/caution,"beware of no track listings.this is a 25 min.5 song ep.while this does'nt effect my opinion of this product ,it might have propted me to put this one off if i had known.anyway i ordered this after having ""vs. earth"" for awhile.i was curious about their earlier stuff but it was always hard to find cheap.well i guess they've been reissued cause they're now affordable. ""freaks""is a solid effort w/a more serious approach than on ""vs. earth"".i got the sence (while listening to ""vs. earth"") that this band was capabal of yeilding great thrash.""freaks"" confirms my suspicion. trax 3,4 & 5 are instant thrash classics."
5,Great economy rings,"I bought a set of these (actually in extra high) to temporarily mount a scope while waiting on delivery of some Burris Signature rings. I think their great and if I didn't have a need to increase the MOA I would leave them on the weapon. They are very smooth on the inside and haven't left a single mark on my scope after mounting removing and replacing a couple times while adjusting things. The rail locks are screwdriver heads and the 8 ring screws are Allen heads. These will fit either a weaver or Pic rail. Another reviewer said they will not work on the 10/22 integrated rail on the top of the receiver and he is correct. That is called a ""Tip off"" mount and Weaver makes specific rings for that application but it is not these."
4,Good Budget Rings,These rings are pretty good quality for the price. I have them on several calibers of rifles and they hold zero well.
5,Solid rings,"Nice and secure. The only problem is that I found them $9 cheaper at my local Wal-Mart. Still, worth every penny I paid."
2,Sloppy fit on colt M4 .22 rail.,They need modification or shimming to fit securely and not rattle around. The other problem I had with them is the fact that even though the package claims that they will fit a scope with a 40mm OBJ lens they did not allow enough clearance for my scope. Now I have to find another option for scope rings.
3,Does not fit Ruger 10/22,Decent rings but they dont fit on the stock Ruger 10/22 weaver rail. Very strange. There are just a touch too big. I was able to file them down and they now fit. For the price I would say decent.
3,False advertising,"The description says 12 pack, but I only received one bulb. The bulbs themselves would be worth a dollar, so I don't know why there was a need to lie about the quantity."
3,"Casanova Wong, the human tornado.",Casanova wong stars in an action filled fight film. Eagle han also stars as an angry mantis style master who will do anything to bring down the shaolin temple. casanova trains in the most deadly styles in order to stop the evil mantis plan.
5,Invincible Shaolin,"This is a very good movie.. Has a great story line threw the movie..And yes some very good fights in it.. This movie has English language audio.. The dvd case lists it on the back as english subtitles but its not.. I have this movie and it is a arse kicking fest so set back and enjoy the butt kicking..Thanks, Stephen"
1,I was expecting a different film,"If you were looking for the highly praised Chang Cheh directed film (aka Unbeatable Dragon), this can't be it! The director listed on the box is a different name altogether, unless it is some sort of translated name. My recollection, in fact, is that the ""other"" film was named ""North Shaolin vs. South Shaolin."" The production quality here is poor and choppy. In one sequence, in fact, the film frame is offset vertically where you see a thin strip at the bottom of the screen representing the very ""top"" of the film frame (how sloppy is that!). The fighting throughout is mundane. The final lengthy fight is reasonably entertaining, but it comes after 85 minutes of torture. The fact that this was a subtitled film, with cramped truncated subtitles, and not a dubbed film made whatever plot existed impossible to follow."
2,"Be Warned, this is NOT the Shaw Brothers classic","I bought this thinking it was the Shaw Bros. classic movie wherein teachers from North Shaolin are sent to train the manchu's, they give a beating to the current instructors (the South shaolin teachers). The Shaw Bros. movie's english title is Invincible Shaolin."
5,Classic movie and good copy!,"Loved this movie as a kid and really enjoyed rewatching it on DVD, without commercial interruptions. Holds up to my fond memories of when I first watched it over 20 years ago! Classic Shaw Brothers!"
1,Save your money,"The lighting is poor, the subtitles are lousy, the cropping results in words going off both sides of the screen, all of which still can't distract the viewer from the fact that the story is mindnumbing. Save your money. I wish someone had saved me mine."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"This book is not what I thought it would be. Instead of telling the story of black church beginnings it digresses,often times in the middle of a sentence to give you sources & a list of preacher names & churches. It lists names of people without giving a background explanation of who they are. There was not a very good flow to the book. I made it through half of it & completely lost interests. It was not what I was looking for & didn't reveal any hidden realities. This serves as more of a source book than providing history on the subject."
2,Intriguing but absurd,"I recently have become a very devoted fan of Jane Eyre, both the book and the broadway musical. I have also read Wuthering Heights a couple of years ago and think it is one of the worst books I have ever read. I picked up Crimes of CB thinking it would be interesting, and it starts out plausible enough, but then becomes increasingly ridiculuos. I cannot believe that one of the most beloved writers of all time would poison one sister and know that the man she married poisoned her other sister and her brother. This goes against every theme that Bronte wrote about in Jane Eyre. I would imagine that she would believe strongly in what she wrote. Jane is a very strong women, yet Tully makes Bronte seem so hopelessly infatuated with Nicholls that she will do anything for him. This book is also not particularly well-written, but I suppose it is kind of entertaining as a summer read. Unfortunately, I think Mr. Tully is only trying to make money off of the Bronte name."
3,lorks a lordy!,Arthur Bell Nicholls? Never in a million years will I believe he had any creative input in the Bronte books. As for the rest anything is possible.
3,Hmmm,"Although I am a lover of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights and Anne Bronte's The Tenent of WildFell Hall, it still did not put me off to this book. Interesting as this read was, I was/am not sure how much to take serious of Mr. Tully's conclusions. The moral of this maybe/maybe not story is Don't Piss Off the Help!"
1,THERE IS A LESSON HERE,"--always, yes always, read the reviews before you buy the book. I was intrigued by the title and the construct, same as ""Wuthering Heights."" First, Mr. Tully never finds a voice; the lawyer Coutts is a credulous fool, and Martha has to be the maid from hell. His very shaky unsupported premise would be laughable if not so insulting to the reader. Mr. Tully should have been aware his title alone would attract some Bronte experts (I am not one), and that his gee-whiz revelations would be slashed to pieces. I felt sorry for the long-dead Brontes for having been treated so shabbily in print. Mr. Tully calls himself a ""criminologist."" What a joke. I agree with another reviewer who would like to see Monty Python make a skit from the story. I see John Cleese or maybe Harvey Corman as the evil curate. Then again, Stephen King could tidy up the plot and scare us all to death."
3,"My, my, what will the Bronte Society say?","If you're interested in Bronte lore, you'll find this book amusing, albeit highly implausible. While it is a little strange that, in real life, the citizens of Haworth refused to give Arthur Bell Nicholls the pastor position at St. Michael's after Patrick Bronte's death, and that servant Martha Brown -did- leave home and family to accompany Nicholls to Ireland shortly after, and while it -is true that Nicholls profited most from the Bronte legacy, it is very hard to believe anyone could poison a whole family of adult children (plus possibly a dog, father, and an old servant) and not get caught. Nonetheless, the book is entertaining to those who know the Bronte story, and perhaps to some of those who don't. It is indeed a bit overargued."
1,Tripe.,"This book was such a waste of time to read! I can't believe the library spent money buying it-but better them than me.The crimes imputed to Charlotte Bronte are nothing compared to those perpetrated by Mr. Tully in writing this book. He begins with a silly premise, and presents it badly. Granted, he is not a professional novelist. However,the absurd dialogue and plot development read like the work of a (not overly talented) high school student. If he has any derious knowledge of the Brontes' lives and work, little is betrayed in this trivial volume. According to an article in the BBC's online service, the author intended it as a work of nonfiction but the publisher would only accept it if he called it a novel.Perhaps the nonfiction approach would have been better, as Mr. Tully would have had to stick to the evidence of the alleged dirty doings at Haworth Parsonage. The book would in that case certainly have been shorter.Or beter yet, non-existant."
4,It's a keeper!,"I've had this book for well over 20 years, and every couple of years I get it back out, re-read it and try a few new experiments. This book would be good for a child (with supervision) who is interested in cause-and-effects relations of science. Some simple crystal experiments may be carried out in hours, some take longer.Even an old engineer still enjoys this book!"
5,Way too deep for me!,"Good book, but goes way too deep in theoryfor me. I just wanted a basic general bookto learn how to grow crystals."
2,The book is fine for kids.,"This book does not contain any useful information. It may be wonderful handbook for young kid that is interesting in crystals growth process and their nature, moreover it is perfectly covers all the subject.But it is totally useless for serious aims!!!"
2,...,Got some good Banda X stuff but the banda chula songs are completely WHACK and its repetitive Merengue nothing else when they said Guerra del Mambo they meant it! You get what you pay for.
5,Best of the Best,"Undoubtably the best I have read. Although stated fiction I feel it was a lot of his personal experiences. A sad time for America, all that lived through it will always remember it. History changes as time progresses but the honor pride and men of honor that stood and fought this war can never be forgotten. They did what was expected for their country and all that stood next to them in their fearless ways. God bless them all and through novels like this we can remember them in our minds and hearts."
4,"Good Price, Good Product",Bought Milia Evolution TV but use the EYE TV software to record. Found Evolution TV software to be a bit weak and not as comprehensive as the EYE TV software. Luckily the EYE TV software is configured to handle the Miglia Evolution TV USB. Godd overall buy for a wonderful price!
5,Beautiful!,"I heard the song ""Hold On 2 Your Faith"" on the radio and it blew me away. If for no other reason, buy the album for this song."
5,The best solo recital album in a while!,"I won't mince my words: This album is fantastic in every way. From Ms. Mattila's singing to the Orchestra's playing, it is practically flawless. I would even venture to say this album is worth buying solely for Ms. Mattila's interpretation of ""Abscheulicher..."". Her high B's are stunning! They are brilliant and full of vibrato, and not pinched or wiry like some sopranos. That is one of the things that attracted me to Mattila's singing is her fluttery and rapid vibrato, that extends to every part of her range (except maybe to her lowest notes, but who listens to a soprano for her low notes???). The rest of the selections on this disc are not very well known, but who cares?? They are filled with beautiful music, and give Ms. Mattila several chances to show off her stuff. This is one that will be in my CD player for a while!"
4,subtle isolation,"Dreamy, Dreary, Jazzy, Lifting, and Lonely, are all words to describe this cd. It floats with hollow pianos, pulsing bass, and warm female vocals provided by the talented Goldfrapp, who give the album a early 20th century jazz feel. The album is a cross between portishead's self title CD, Alpha's ""ComeFromHeaven"", and Mono's ""Life in Mono"". So if you are a fun of any of those cd's, you won't be let down by this one."
5,Best Goldfrapp album -timeless piece,"I discovered Goldfrapp through a compilation of music that Spanish director Pedro Almodovar published as the music that inspired him to write his scripts (""Viva La Tristeza""). That album carried the track ""Paper Bag"" by Goldfrapp. I was captured by her voice (a blend between Emiliana Torrini and BJork, at times) and sensuality, and her sound that seems to not quite belong to any particular period, but rather float in a timeless ether that makes her music fit just about any place or situation.Though there's a minor touch of the lounge sound that characterized the turn of the century, five years after its release, this album still feels very fresh and current. My favorite tracks, along with the title song, are ""Pilot"" and ""Utopia"". Without a doubt, this is Goldfrapp's best album to date, even beyond her 2006 US release, ""Supernature""."
3,"So close to four, but there's just not enough.","The electrolady comparison to Portishead is apt, though: this is not as musically varied (neither instrumentation nor the often simple up & down melodies are quite that good), and I'm not sure whether the previous reviewer meant ""strange"" as a complIment or as a complEment to more accessible, normal stuff. Often eerie, haunting, and beautiful, this is a welcome addition for all semi-depressed smart people whom pop disgusts beyond consideration. I find that the mark of a really good album is disagreement over favorite songs (which this obviously achieves), and to further that, mine was the ""out of place"" instrumental, ""Oompa Radar."" One might also try The Hope Blister, Snake Farm, Mono, etc."
3,mediocrity at its best!,"Sorry to be the dissenting opinion here, but this album is not that great. Allison Goldfrapp is unconvincing, and lacks the charisma to be heard over this overproduced and highly derivative mess. High-tech glitchery and slick production (yes, even horn sections and strings) can never make up for weak songs and a weak performance.This is commercial pop music for the middle-aged. Skip this and go strait to Bjork's album Vespertine."
5,Sooooooo Good,"Ms. Goldfrapp is the cool, without any of the usual pretension that's associated with groups like Portishead. She does much of this stuff herself (including the sleeve layout) and seems to take real pride in the art. Yes, I luv this music. Sumptuous, beautiful, with great comments on society and futurism (e.g. how the quest for utopia is the motive behind fascists and other ideologues), and lyrics like ""Frankenstein would want your lovely head."" It doesn't hurt that I'm part Swiss and she does the only sexy yodeling I've ever heard (yodeling usually makes me cringe). There's a version with bonus tracks that include the video mix of ""Pilots"" which I like a lot but unfortunately didn't get."
4,Listen Closely,This cd lasted all of about a minute on my computer initially. Next! Well then I took the time to listen to it carefully under good headphones. This is excellent music. Alice Goldfrapp's voice is great and she rarely over expresses. The music is variable and original. I think this is one cd that will hold up to multiple listenings and reward me with something new each time.
5,Dreamy,I noticed Goldfrapp a few weeks ago watching a late night music programme when the video for 'Pilots' came on. I was blown away by the utter dreaminess of the music and decided to investigate further. I could not leave my room when I put on the cd. The songs all have their own textures and came to love 'Oompa Radar' in particular winds to a climax of astounding heights. Better than Air.
4,The Sounds of Utopia.,"Ahh...Felt Mountain.It's been awhile since I've been so....""transported"" (for lack of a better term) by a disc. Goldfrapp has composed an amazing album including one song, ""Utopia"", to which I have been listening nonstop. The song has absolutely bewitched me. (I immediately ran out and bought the Utopia EP, which is also well worth the money). Other reviewers have accurately described the sound and atmosphere of this disc as being similar to the soundtrack from a 60's-70's James Bond movie.Film noirish, cinematic, ethereal, dreamy...all apt descriptions of this fine disc to which I would have awarded 5 stars were it not for tracks 5-7, which I feel are not quite up to par with the other tunes on Felt Mountain. This may change however, with repeated listenings. And yes, this disc most definitely bears many, many repeated spins in the CD player.So quit reading already and take the fantastic trip to Felt Mountain!"
3,Music for 3 a.m.,"This is the kind of music you lie in bed to with your headphones on. Felt Mountain is so textured and layered with ambience and an unshakable creepiness, that for the first few spins listening to each song is an experience. The comparison to Portishead isn't out of place as cabaret and lounge music with an eerie bent come to mind. The Shirley Bassey influence is obvious throughout the whole the album but it really stands out on 'Human,' which I must concur with other reviewers, is the best James Bond theme song that never was. My biggest problem with this album is that the majority of the tracks sound too similiar. This is partly compensated by the fact that it's a short album...it ends without you feeling exhausted and glad to hit eject button. I still don't think it matches Portishead...but I like what Goldfrapp has done here."
4,Atmospheric... oniric.. contemporary ambient,"I am in my early forties, and this album I hear in a cd store some years ago while browsing.. i just could not help appreciating the surreal sound of this music, I just had to get it..get some good wines, get together with your friends, this is perfect ambient music .. in the road while its raining and you really need your to be in a different world.. this is the music"
3,A trifle dissapointing...,"Many electronica fans know the voice of Allison Goldfrapp, and may not even know it. She has granted the use of her frail, eerily beautiful voice to incredible talents such as BT and Orbital, and now has her own album. It's a shame that it's so dissapointing. 9 tracks of averageness. She sings much the same as she does in all the songs she's ever sang in, which is good, but after you listen in awe at the vast beauty of track one, and get to track two, you begin to hear many of the same samples. ""It's alright"", you think, until you get to track three... Many of the tracks have the same sound. Quiet strings and almost no beat, and much harpsicord and anolog waves. It is a great album to listen to every-once-in-a-while, but not for frequent listening. Sorry, Alison, love you, but you'll have to try again."
2,Heartfelt But Uneven,"Goldfrapp`s debut is interesting at parts yet as a whole one feels it could have achieved more. The combination of trip hop, cabaret music, electronica, pop and torch songs is captivating and makes for a pleasant listen, though it hasn`t great memorable moments and sounds like a too linear, unsurprising record. It`s not bad, yet it doesn`t convince as a whole. ""Human"" is the best song here, as it contains the edge and energy that seems to lack in most of the moments of the album. Allison`s voice is seductive enough, but the songs aren`t too engaging, making for a decent if a bit flat debut. A listenable, moody record with little staying power."
4,Very good album,"This is a very interesting album. It is on the most part moody, which is what drew me to it to begin with. I really like the vocal work on Felt Mountain. This is much different than what she is doing now. I like this much better, although the new album is quite a success. ""Lovely Head"" is my favorite song on this album. If I was to use only one word to describe this album, I would use atmospheric. If you like moody down-tempo, trip -hop music this is a good bet."
5,the main jerry miller!,there are two jerry millers..this one(moby grape) and a rhode island one(j geils)both of them are simply wonderfull musicians.both are undderated.both need as much exposure as possible because when you are talking jerry millers you are talking GREAT playin!this cd..by the grape jerry miller..is what r&b is all about.its what we all need ! now for some more reissues..er..and a reformation of the original band please????
2,American bias,"From the American point of view, not the Allies point of view. The suggestion that only 8th Air Force fighters ""could actually shoot [the Luftwaffe] down in a dogfight"" is typically absurd. The Me-163 caption is one of many errors. It only deserves 2 stars because of the quality of the photos, not the accuracy of the captions or history."
1,had to send back,"Not sure what to say product was defective. Sound, fit, size, was good but like I said it was defective, would not stay paired with phone"
2,Save your money,"This headset is not worth the money. It will not stay paired up to my phone which is a razr. Maybe with another phone it would but keeps disconnecting even when it is within two feet of the phone. The volume is not as loud as the Logitech that I have and the wind tunneling and background noise makes it hard for people to hear you. I drive truck and have a lot of noise around me and people have a hard time understanding me. My Logitech has no problems at all. So let's put it this way, anyone want to buy one of these let me know as I have one that I'll sell you with less than 1 hour of use on it. Wayne McCann"
5,The HS 890 works great,I am extremely pleased with both the Performance and Comfort of this Bluetooth Headset. I have used others and this is the best.
3,Is this CD a Keepa?,"I purchased this CD for one particualr song, ""We offer Praise"", however I found it enjoyable esecially if the listener is partial to the contemporyary style of old school gospel.On a side note it was surprising to hear the voice of a young Donald Lawrence."
5,PRAISE THE LORD,"I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW, AND I AM GLAD I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS CD. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GOSPEL(NEW AGE) CD'S I'VE HEARD. REMINDS ME OF THE OLD KIRK FRANKLIN. THIS CD IS 'A KEEPA'THANKS RODNIE BRYANT. I WILL DEFINATELY BY THE OTHER ONE."
4,My wife was happy with it.,I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my wife. She thinks it's a good book. Can't say more because I haven't read it.
2,Fossil not living up to my expectations,"I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago. At first, I was pleased with the watch. The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band. The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright. Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!). I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke. Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind). If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery. I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby. In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!! How inconvenient. I am not impressed."
3,Dead Battery,"When I received my watch, it did not work at all. I thankfully live near a fossil store where I took it and they replaced the battery free of charge. Although they were not the best ones to change it since now the back of my watch is all scratched up. So unless you have a fossil store near by or don't mind paying for a new battery then it isn't that bad of an investment over all."
1,Fossil Watch,"I ordered and received the watch in a decent amount of time. However, I had to return it because it didn't work at all and have yet to receive a refund. I find that very disappointing."
4,"this is true ""georiga""",i just wished this movie was longer.....i just enjoyed this so much...it's a must see if you like georiga.
2,Let down by the female side,"This recording is unsatisfactory principally because of there being an uneven cast. Jane Eaglen is a squally and dramatically colorless Elisabeth. She shouldn't have taken this role given the lousy vocal condition she is in. Waltraud Meier's voice shows much sign of wear and tear, probably a result of her taking on too demanding roles in the theaters. Yet, her singing of Venus still has much fire. I have almost no reservations for the men in the cast. Of Barenboim's conduction, I can only say that he is a dedicated conductor but is also one who at times fail to link up the different episodes of the music smoothly."
2,Bad blot on a fine recording,"Barenboim's conducting is superb, and most of the singers here are better than good. Unfortunately, the result is marred by the ungainly Elisabeth of Jane Eaglen, who is in very poor voice here. I believe an over-dosage of Wagnerian roles in recent years has taken a heavy toll on her voice and she often sounds strident and off-pitch in higher notes. Her phrasing is also less expansive than in the past. Furthermore, her interpretation lacks depth. What a bad blot on what is otherwise a fine recording."
5,Excellent,This trash bin solved our problem of kids (1 & 3 now) running around with bathroom trash cans on their heads. Yuck! Now our bathroom bin in on the wall always in the same spot. Great solution to our walking bathroom trash can problem.
4,Loved it!,"This item is GREAT! Unfortunatley it didn't fit on the cabinet door where we planned for it to go, but it was such a great prouduct we kept it and will find another spot for it in the garage. The bags really stay on the frame- such a cool invention!"
3,i dont own this item but,"I was seconds from buying it, when i saw the shipping charge, and checked out simple humans website... and they have free shipping on items over $50. I actually ended up ordering a dual trash/recycling can the pulls out on a track."
1,This is NOT George MacDonald but a very bad abridgement,"If you are really interested in reading George MacDonald, this is not the book for you. The text of the orignal book, ""Thomas Wingfold Curate"" on which this book is suppoedely based, is wildly tampered with, from the very first sentence of the novel. This is not George MacDonald at all. The editor has taken huge liberties with one of literature's great Christian authors. I would suggest that you find the original text of this book rather that reading this. It will be worth the search. It is much better than this abridgement, which doesn't even have the courage to call itself that."
1,A shadow of the real thing.,"If you really want to read this story then you will find a copy of ""Thomas Wingfold"" by George MacDonald. I can't imagine why anyone would want to read an edited version when the real thing is available. Check out the official George MacDonald website. Many of his works are available on line, I'm not sure about this one. George MacDonald was one of the great ones and his stories, novels, poems and spiritual writings hold up well, in spite of the Victorian language. It is worth the extra effort to read the real thing instead of its shadow."
5,Indefatigable,"Not only have I listened to this cd on repeat for hours while writing, I've returned to it again and again since I originally bought it. Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review, but my ire was ignited when I saw references to Buckner having hit a plateau in his music: this simply is not true. Amazing is the album that stays relevant, fresh, and worthy years after its acquisition."
5,Even better than Dents and Shells,"I agree with one reviewer, Richard Buckner's music requires careful over and over listening. The first time you hear this album, it all seems to run together in your head, with little standout. As you grip deeper though, the melodies start to ring in your head, at the same time, you are listening to the intense lyrics that seem poetic at times. This album is possibly his best ever, and I have all of them. Its just a work of beauty.It is a little more upbeat than Dents and Shells, and more flavorful as well. But the sparseness continues....and thats a good thing. Its not Indie persay, but not alt-country either. Its somewhere in-between these genres. Most of all, its just really good folk rock."
1,DId not look like the photo,"I had two primary issues with these shoes.1) They did not look like the photo, they are actually very shiny and plastic looking.2) They are very uncomfortable."
1,Confusing ending,"I have read Ms Dams 3 Hilda J books now and I just don't get it.Murder in Red, White & Blue was interesting UNTIL the solution.Never, never have I had to try so hard to figure out the ending."
2,Can it get more boring than this?,"OK, I deserved it! After suffering through the first Hilda Johansson mystery, I should have learned my lesson. This main character is so wooden, so unlovable, so contrary...and the plot is so thin and undeveloped...it's not a rewarding read! Stick with the author's Dorothy Martin series...that's where she apparently puts her best efforts!"
1,what a disappointment,"For research purposes, the book is virtually useless as the images are so poorly reproduced (dark Xerox quality). This is particularly disappointing as the collection is world-class and very extensive."
1,"Do not use this product, save your child's skin","I HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL SAVE SOMEONE'S CHILD...I have purchased the whole Mustela line before my baby's arrival, and I was convinced I am paying for a great European product. I stopped using the wipes after first week of use. They irritated my baby's skin. I did however continued to use this lotion and shampoo.. Today my baby is 7 weeks old, and I am fighting her super dry skin she got from using the lotion! We even made a visit to doctor yesterday where they confirmed the irritated skin and all these patches of super dry skin are from the lotion! Now we are saving the delicate skin with Aveeno product... which is FRAGRANCE FREE!"
2,Ok product at first,"My son has eczema so I've tried very lotion under the sun. This product was okay for the first few days. The smell wasn't refreshing like the no rinse solution or the foam shampoo, but my son seemed to like it. After the 3rd day he started crying only when I put this lotion on him. It was burning his skin. This may work for others, but my baby's skin is too sensitive for this product. I have not had a problem with the other Mustela products."
1,NOT HYPOALLERGENIC,"Mustela baby lotion was recommended to me by my pediatrician because my baby has extremely sensitive skin. I ordered the lotion and the massage oil online after reading great reviews and when I used these products on my baby she seemed to be okay, but I broke out into a horrible rash. The only thing that has caused such a problem for me in the past is sulfa drugs, and the ingredients in these products do not include, sulfa, so I don't know what it is that caused the problem, but this is definitely NOT hypoallergenic.It has a very strong scent that I wasn't very fond of as well. I would have tolerated the scent if I liked the products, but I can't imagine that anything with this heavy of a perfumed scent can be good for anyone! It certainly irritated my skin!"
4,dissappointed in smell,"smells like an old lady in my opinion, not a good baby smell like i was hoping for. it does make your skin feel soft, but the ingredients arent anything special: water, mineral oil, shea butter, jojoba oils, and lots of things that arent good ingredients if you check it out on cosmetics database [...]cant return it since ive used it, but i feel like i just wasted $13 on this"
5,My favorite lotion!,"This lotion smells wonderful and makes my baby's skin so soft. I love the light feel and the scent is just divine. I highly recommend this product. It is a bit more expensive than many store brands, but it is worth the splurge!"
3,"Nice scent but not ""natural"" as some describe","Some describe this product as natural, however these products contain parabens and other preservatives. Spend a couple more bucks and get some California Baby products."
4,Valuable insight.,"I must say that I disagree with the earlier negative review. I was turned on to the Enneagram and Mr. Riso's work by a friend and have been a supporter ever since. This is not about a cult religion or an alternative belief system. It is about seeing the whole picture of yourself, positives and negatives. The Enneagram test enabled me to see the things about myself that I didn't want to see and the things that friends and family may not want to tell you personally. An invaluable tool for self discovery. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the personality type descriptions tend to be a little short. (A problem remedied by Mr. Riso's book ""Personality Types""). For those looking for a quicker read, I highly recommend this book. If a more insightful description of your personality type is what you are looking for, try Mr. Riso's book ""Personality Types""."
3,Some people need a test,"This book is handy for those who need a test to find their enneagram number. It's much better though to read one of the other books that describe the nine spaces, than to take a test. Riso and Hudson have written other books which describe nine levels within the nine types, anyone who takes the time to read these will probably find oneself in there. However, some don't like to read or do better with something like the questionaire. This one isn't bad, (there are better one's out there) but it can be a handy resource on one's bookshelf. Serious students on the enneagram would probably want a copy, however, if resources are limited or one is just starting, another book would be better."
4,Decent Release - Horrible Extra's,"I'll keep it simple:Great Dark Melodic Metal.While not quite as stunning as their latest ""Phoenix..."" album, this is a great listen and worth your time.The only thing I could not get over was the discs extra's. (Horrid Wall Papers and such...)This Album came out around a time when European Black/Death Metal bands thought it was cool to play in a room full of rainbow colored lights and strippers (a-la atrocity's ""Taste of Sin"" video - which by the way has my vote for most Hilarious metal video around... Metal space pirates in a strip club LOL)"
5,"Great choice for a light, easy to read, durable watch","We have a matching pair of Momentum Atlas Titanium Bracelet Watches with a Black dial. They are light, easy to read (big dial), hold up well with constant wear (my body chemistry destroys most watches). I saw the Mens and Womens matching watches with the white dial and they don't disappoint. My wife loves her new watch!"
1,Returned this watch,"This watch was damaged upon receipt. It was not boxed properly and had been rattling around in the box when I received it. The band was dull and an odd, cheap looking color. Not worth the money in my opinion. Very disappointed."
3,Not bad,I thought I was going to like this CD a lot more than I did. I like this CD but Basil Rathbone Made it okay. I wish Claude Rains was in this CD instead of Basil Rathbone. Exept for Claude Rains dosn't do Raidio Shows.
5,Ultimate Consulting How To,"Where Alan Weiss other books deal with the business side of consulting, this one is a collection of hands-on tools every consultant needs to have in his set. Among topics treated are information gathering, coaching, culture change, and leadership. Ever mindful of the need to create value, the book also teaches you to create conditions for a successful consulting assignment by dealing with the key players and avoiding political landmines within the client organisation, avoiding intimidation and pushing back when you have to.The numerous case studies further bring the tools and their correct application into sharper relief."
3,Powerful but doesn't entirely pay off,"Robert Stone is a writer I want to like more than I actually do. He's certainly a bold stylist who, in this book and others, presents an unrelentingly bleak view of humanity that is hard to shrug off. And he manages to also sneak in some sly humor and jaundiced observations about various social mores that offset the darkness of his prose. Being a former resident of New Orleans, I did think this book was quite effective at evoking the city's character and grit in many passages. Ultimately, though, I started to get bored with the plot well before it reached a conclusion. I might well try another Stone book some day (also read Dog Soldiers some time ago) but he's not exactly at the top of my to-read list at the moment."
4,Thanks.,"I'd like to ardently thank ""A Reader from New York"" for giving away the last line of this book, which I bought shorty before reading your review. That was very, very considerate of you."
3,Inhale the '60's,"Remember when you were kids and the latenight FM played softly in the darkness and candlelight; and you were so together with your friends that even the cat seemed to sense the community. Getting loaded brought all of you to hilarity and heavyness in alternating waves and every thought made the most perfect sense, Remember that?In the morning, your friends were fussing for coffee, the cat had peed on the carpet, the FM was playing news of some new riot or assassination, the candle had melted onto the table, and there was no humor and certainly no heavyness.Mr. Stone's book is just like that. Put this book up on the shelf next to your old copys of Rolling Stone."
3,OK if you don't know a thing about Sydney,This video shows a quick overview of Sydney then spends a lot of time and effort to get shots of flowers and plants in the gardens. Too much time is spent on gardens and parks. Not enough time on the city itself. Trailer preview was not working so I had to take a chance and order it without a clue what it was like.
2,Not good for aggressive chewers,"Had high hopes for this toy - but it didn't last. Within a week, my dog had the cover off, the rubber shell split and the squeaker out."
1,What a peice of crap...,"I bought this for my little dog, and she played with it for 15 minutes out side when we first noticed the covering was falling off. Within an hour of chasing is around the yard it looked like it had been run through a paper shredder. What a cheap piece of crap. I have bought a lot of Kong products, and they are generally great, but this one is just garbage. Do yourself a favor and don't bother buying this one. Dave"
1,Kong air football,The kong air dog squeaker football toy was very disapointing. My dog chewed it up with in minutes of having it. Do not recomend this toy. Kong needs to stick to the hard rubber toys.
1,Another Kong toy not for my dog,My small dog had parts of the covering on this toy chewed off within 15 minutes. Very disappointed. Sent it back for credit.
1,Not For Strong Chewers,"If you are looking for a durable dog toy for a strong chewer, as this toy is billed, pass by this one. Within 3 minutes my dog had peeled half the felt off the ball and was swallowing/coughing out bits of felt. The ball stayed intact but the covering came off nearly instantly. My old Air Dog toys (maybe pre-Kong since that branding is not on the older toys) stand up to this dog and are still intact. I purchased another Kong Air Dog toy (a 3 arm spinner thingy) at the same time as this football and it lasted less than 5 minutes as well with the dog chewing through the rubber with ease."
2,Not good for chewers,"I got this toy from my local Petsmart thinking it would be durable enough to stand my French Bulldogs punishment that he puts every toy through. Within a few hours he had half the yellow tennis ball covering ripped off with the underlying rubber exposed. If your dog is a little destroyer like mine, think twice before purchasing this item."
1,Caused TOOTH INFECTION!!,"I have two young male chihuahuas that love to destroy their toys, so I am always on the lookout for something sturdy for them to play with. I bought this product and my dogs actually loved it because of its unique squeek. Sadly, this football was no match for thier ""love"". By the end of the week they had ripped patches of the neon fuzz right off the ball and then they went for the the purple foam laces. A couple days later one of my dogs wouldn't eat his food and whined when I touched his mouth.I was able to look in his mouth I could see that the roof of his mouth was swollen and his gums looked gross and infected. I took him to the vet,they gave him a little sedative, and checked his mouth. The cause turned out to be purple foam and yellow fuzz stuck between his teeth. He had to be put on antibiotics and I had to soften his food for a week because he couldnt chew. Please, do your dog and your wallet a favor and buy something else."
2,Air Kong Football Squeaker,"We have a four year old white German Shepherd that can destroy a toy in seconds. The only toys that have stood up to his teeth are the Kong brand. We have had several Kong toys over the years but the only thing he hasn't destroyed were the black Kong toys - he has put holes in them but he can't shred them like other toys.Reading the reviews here, I thought this would be a good toy for him (knowing full well that a regular tennis ball will last less than a minute in his mouth). He had the felt skin off this football in under 10 minutes, on both ends. He has not dismantled the toy yet but the flannel is done.Word of warning for those of you who have a very aggressive chewer... this isn't the toy for them. Only the black Kong toys have been able to withstand this type of chewing."
2,Chewed right through it!,I have a med to large dog which is 8 months old. I bought this because he loves anything that make noise. He chewed right through this thing in just 3 days. It is not as strong as they say it is. I will not be buying any more of this type of product. It would be better for smaller dogs.
2,dog football,"The football lasted her about 2 hrs. then it was torn up , she got the squeck out real easy then I put it back in , that lasted about 20 min. buy another one .. no way"
3,Is still chewable...,"I have a 10 month old labradoodle who likes to chew on everything! We finally decided to go with the Kong brand of toys to see if they would hold up. I was impressed with the weight of this football when I held it. After about 20 minutes of playing with this football, he already started chewing off the fabric so now we only let him have it when we are playing with him or he would sit and chew on the whole thing until it's ruined. Hopefully we can get a little extra life out of it this way! I don't know that I would purchase another one in the future with the same fabric on it."
3,Squeeker Died in Less Than 2 Hours,"I've had two of these. The squeeker went out on the first in about two weeks. My dog loved the toy so much, I decided to try another. With in two hours of opening the box, the squeeker died.I won't buy another and I can't really recommend it, but I gave it three stars because my dog's still crazy about it. She likes the odd bounce it can take when I throw it. Sadly, I don't expect it to last much longer... holes are starting to develop around the seams.--"
2,very disappointed,"I love kong toys. I have three german shepherds and bought three large footballs. The first day all of the covering was torn off of one of them. The second day, the second cover was half gone and the actual ball was split. The third is still squeaking but the cover is almost off. They LOVE the toys, but do not let them out of your sight for a minute because they are easily devoured."
1,*** REMAKE !!! ****,"I thought, this product would be a GREAT NEW TOY for my Border Collies,BUT ............... , ***UNLESS YOUR DOGS HAVE THE BITE OF A ""PIT BULL"",They will have a VERY HARD TIME to make ""IT"" (hard) ""SQUEEK"" !!!!!!!!!!!So, I guess that I will just have to go buy another one, ""SOME PLACE ELSE"" !**** ANOTHER POINT OF INTEREST ****When I placed the order, the ""SIZES"", *** ""WERE NOT WELL EMPHASIZED"" !!!The LARGE SIZE I ordered, was WAY TO BIG for my Border Collies -- (MY BAD) !So, I will just have to go and buy another ""SOFTER"" & a ""MEDIUM SIZE BALL"" .The same also applies to the ""BARBELL"" , that I bought with the ""FOOTBALL"" !!"
3,Fatal puncture wounds,"My greyhounds LOVE any toy with a squeaker, but they have managed to destroy them all. Being a Kong, I thought we might have better luck with this football, but within the first hour of play, one of the dogs managed to puncture it and the squeaker. The football is still intact sitting in their toy basket - they haven't torn it apart, but they also really aren't interested in playing with it since it doesn't squeak. I don't see how the squeaker could be replaced either."
2,Only for small dogs,"You would think a Kong item would last with a large dog but My Mastiff/Dane mix tore the squeeker out in less then a day then proceeded to tear the rest apart so I had to get rid of it. If you have a large dog, stick to the standard Black Kong Extreme, nothing else lasts."
3,Nice Ball BUT...,"It was a nice ball, but I expected better from Kong! Only took our Lab 2 days before he tore it up. Wish they would make a great ball that these big furry kids can actually get a good amount of play time with. We never let our Lab just sit and chew his balls. If we are not throwing it with him it gets put up. So that lets you know how well they are NOT made! If someone knows of a great ball that will last, Please let me know. Thanks! :-)"
1,dog toys,"This toy sucks, my dog destroyed this toy within a couple of days. Don't waste your time or money on this item if your dog likes to chew on toys."
2,Not made the best,I was really excited about this product since my 8 month old pit bull loves the Kong squeaker ball. It seemed like it was maybe a little too big for him to get in his mouth but he managed. In less than five minutes he had already had the felt tore. It seems where they put the kong label they didn't fasten the felt down well enough. So just a little gap in a toy opens the door for him to start ripping it. It does have a cool squeak but I wouldn't recommend it because the felt is poorly fastened. Extremely disappointed!!
2,Cover issue,My dog loves the toy but is falling appart after just one play....the felt cover is peeling fast and the rubber perishes after 3-4 days of play
1,Not worthy of being called a KONG,I purchased this ball because normally kong products are long lasting but my 1 y/o english bulldog destroyed it in a day.
2,Fell apart first use.,"We have a 5 year old black lab, high energy. We never buy her squeeky toys because they are just a waste of money as they are immeidately destroyed. Unfortunately this was no different. We played fetch with her for about 20 - 30 minutes and the outter tennis ball type skin ripped and came off. She would typically chew this off if left alone with the toy but this was only during our game of fetch that it came off so I was expecially disappointed. I bought this based on many of the reviews for the toy. I think it would be great for a less energetic, non-chewing dog. For my high energy lab, it was a waste of money.Pros:Great squeekerLarger toyCons:Fell apart during 1 30 minute session of fetch.Poor investment in a toy for my dog."
2,Lasted about 3 days,"My boxer mix looked so cute with this, a little ""line-backer""! But within hours he'd shredded off the cover and within days the ball was in tiny shards to be vacuumed up."
1,Not durable at all,"Didn't last long... first my dogs picked off all the fuzz, then managed to puncture it with their teeth and before long had the puncture hole chewed out... within 5 days they were done with it -- not my idea of a good purchase..."
1,Poor Durability,I gave this to my dog and in less than a minute he had tore the end completely off it. Returning it of course.
1,My Dog ate right throw it in a matter of minutes!!!,My Pitbull boxer ate right threw it. I ordered 3 kong squeakers and they were all gone by the end of the night what a waste of $30.00
2,It slowed her up a little***,"I have a Dachshund that tears up every toy I give her. I was hoping this would be the answer. I gave it to her while I unpacked the rest of my Amazon order. She was running around and I heard the squeaker, she loved it. The next time I looked she was tearing off the yellow covering and running with a trail of yellow following her. With great difficulty, I took the rest of the covering off. She has now played with it for almost an hour with no further damage. Maybe it should be sold with no covering. I must admit, it did slow her up a little.It's now about 3 hours later and the football has been totally destroyed. Not a good idea for determined chewers."
2,kong football,"I recently purchased this dog toy, along with some other. I would not recommend for a large dog. It was chewed up third day. The material was very thin inside. I purchased the kong bone toy, it is still going strong even with the squeeker. The football toy over priced for the value."
1,not even out of package and he already got the yellow fabric off,"I have a 1yr old beagle, he weighs 20 lbs...we got this in the mail toady 12/7 and I didn't even have the package off of the ball and my dog ripped the yellow fabric off of it."
1,It didn't last long,"It took less than 24 hours for my Labrador to destroy the squeaky part inside the ball. She has been chewing on it and it is all torn now. Good news is, it is not in pieces yet."
2,not what I expected from Kong,"It is a quite large toy intended for large breeds (so I thought). However, my german shepherds tore it to pieces in a little over one hour.... May be it should be mentioned that this is a rather soft toy not intended for large dogs."
4,Good squeaker toy,have a 75lb pitty who chews up all toys and loves to take the noise make out. i will give her this for about 25 mins until she starts trying to destory it.. then put it away. everytime i take it out she goes crazy like its the first time.. the squeaker is still intact & she loves it..only wish it was made out of more durable material so i could let her chew on it longer..
1,Great While it Lasts,"My Brussels Griffon LOVES his squeaker toys. I thought I had a new durable toy coming from KONG, but within ten minutes he had half the felt off, and the squeaker removed.The squeaker's just a small plastic screw-looking piece inserted into a hole on the end of the rubber football, a breeze to pull out if your dog has smaller teeth or is at all persistent.Hoping he still might enjoy the football shape minus he squeaker and felt material.."
3,Kong Football,"The dogs love this football, but due to the packaging containing velcro, the felt cover was a little frayed were it was attached. Of course the huskys thought that little fuzz was a pull tab and almost ripped the cover right off the ball in the first 5 minutes. Ball is strong. Cover isn't. then again... I have four huskies."
5,Great Toy,Bought this for my pittie several months ago and it's still intact. Not sure why she hasn't ripped this up like she does her other toys but she loves it. She will lay on the floor squeaking it and making herself howl.
5,My dogs love it!,I have had to order a few of these because my dogs love them so much! This item arrived on time!
4,Fun Bouncing Toy,"My flatcoat retrievers love this. It's likely to land crazily and bounce all over the place. The squeaker doesn't work well when this toy gets wet, but otherwise it's a nice durable fun toy for them."
3,I'm not impressed.,"Although the football itself seems to be holding up fairly well, my Lab mix virtually skinned the thing. Pulling off all the decals and yellow fibers. Surely KONG has a better option for covering these toys?Luckily, I learned not to leave this particular dog alone with most toys. Otherwise she no doubt would've swallowed all that nasty yellow fuzz!"
3,Not good for strong chewers,My miniature schnauzer loves tennis balls. He tears the felt right off them. This toy is made just like a tennis ball. He tore the felt off in a matter of minutes. He still likes the toy and the squeaker remains intact so far. Should be a long-lasting KONG toy.
4,So Squeaky!,Well I figured I would give these a go. Dogs tend to love anything that squeaks and of course the tennis ball feel brings back fairly good memories of lots of fuzzy broken balls.I think it is important to stress that these footballs are not chew toys. They are designed to be interactive play between yourself and dog. So long as this is adhered to the ball will last a fair while.my dogs LOVE this toy- the squeak and the bounce seem to captivate them. Pretty good price for the toy also.Highly recommend.
1,Nope...another one to cross off my list,"Thought with the ""Kong"" name this might be a winner, but within 10 minutes my pit-mix had removed the fuzz, popped one end and committed a squeakectomy."
1,Boxer Dog,Have a 100lb Boxer dog and this was his x mas present. He destroyed the toy in less than 5 hours. Ripped the cover off the Football then ripped in pieces the uncover part . Bad for big dogs!!!
1,I can't recommend this one -,"My lab (18 months) loves the Kong squeaker tennis balls. Amazingly, she doesn't destroy them like she has other cheap versions. The football came and she definitely loved running around with it and squeaking it. BUT the first time she lay down to squeak on it for a bit she managed to tear the edge off the cover by the big blue spot in less that a minute or two. The rubber there just gives too much of an edge they can tear with their teeth that the balls don't have. Too bad."
1,DOES NOT LAST-TWO SQUEAKS WAS ALL,I bought this for our little dachshunds. It arrived today and I immediately took it outside and squeaked it before throwing it and our two dogs ran like crazy! Penny brought it back. On the third thow it did not squeak anymore. I had the same thing happen with another Air Dog Squeaker toy that arrived earlier in the week from a different supplier. One did not work at all upon arrival. I sent both back for a refund and will do the same for this item. I was under the impression that KONG toys were really durable. I'm not going to spend six dollars on a toy that doesn't last five minutes. The other purchase was 15.00 for the two dumbells. Very disappointed.
4,Great toy,"My german sheppard loves it, but she ripped off the felt in one day! Other than that, lots of fun throwing it around."
5,Dog's delight!!!,My weim LOVES this football!! He is 13 but acts 3 when he has this in his mouth and running. Finally a product that that will last more than one afternoon. I would highly recomend this product.
3,"durable, but too loud","Great ball, good shape, and very durable, but I don't let Lexi play with it anymore because it is way too loud. Sounds like a fire truck siren screeching through your eardrums. Not recommended for use in public parks or dog runs. If you have 40 acres of private land, then this ball will be okay, and you must invite me :)"
5,"Nice Looking Bags, Good Instructions","These bags look really cool, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. Should be fun!"
2,Swim School Toddler: OK but faulty,"As per prior reviews, the steering wheel falls off immediately, so be prepared for this."
3,Toddler Racer so-so,"We bought the Toddler Racer because we loved the infant boat. Our two year old doesn't really like going in the new racer because it sinks down in the back (the infant model did NOT do this)and the front end goes up. She is a petite child, so weight is not the issue. We also think it came defective because air continually leaks out and it needs to be re-inflated each time we use it which is a big hassle."
2,Great toy when it actually works,"I read the reviews and still bought 2 for my 2 year old twins despite the warnings of the infamous leak. They loved it and it got them comfortable in the pool BUT one leaked. So, I bought another one (never returned the broken one as I don't have a lot of time to get to the post office these days). This one has a leak too. If they ever fix it its a great toy but I am not buying my 4th..."
3,"Fun Float, it Just Goes Flat","My 2 year old son loves this boat for the pool. He was so afraid of the pool last year and now loves the pool this year. Only problem is it must have a slow leak. I blow it up one day and is flat the next. I believe someone else below had a similar problem. I'm going to try another, hopefully will be fine."
1,Terrible Product!,"This boat does not stay flat in the water as shown in the picture. Instead, the front popped out so high that my baby was almost lying on his back. I wasn't able to have him in the pool and be hands-free at the same time. Instead, I had to forcibly hold the front of the boat down in order for it to float ""flat."" In addition, the thing lost air in less than one day and never did stay inflated. Overall, it was a very disappointing product. I would NOT recommend this to anyone!"
3,Broken Parts,"We bought this floating device for our 2 year old son for a vacation in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. He loves being in the water and we thought that this product would be fun and safe for him along with helping him start to understand the concept of swimming. The steering wheel piece broke off immediately and would not stay on secure from that point on. Also it seemed that it did not hold it's air for very long. It is a cute float for a cheap price, and you basically get what you pay for."
5,We've had it for 3 years,"I am actually quite impressed with this product. We bought it when my daughter was two used it when we went on vacation and then hauled it out of storage two years later to use it again. It actually had a tiny hole in it when we first bought it so I simply took one of those Johnson & Johnson water proof band-aids, cut off one of the sticky sides and covered the hole with the sticky part. It's still on after three years. We used it for my two year old son when we went on vacation and he loved it. It even held up my daughter who is now four years old. Granted they both weigh the same."
4,good,"A little dated. Some of the spots open to the public are no longer in operation so be sure to plan and call ahead. Overall, it is a good guide to have."
2,Disappointing,"I was introduced to this product at a Marriott Hotel -- it was one of the little complementary bottles in the bathroom. Absolutely loved it. When I used it all up, I noticed the URL on the bottle and realized I could order more. Wish I hadn't. It's just not the same, not nearly as fragrant. Could get something cheaper at the drugstore."
1,Worst map I ever bought.,Not a tourist friendly map. Not much detail of downtown. It is only a map without help to understand the city or the major attractions.
4,"""Sweet And Lovely""","Thelonious Monk's ""Jazz Moods: 'Round Midnight"" is one of the best-ever jazz CDs from my collection. Who can better play the eleven classic jazz pieces here than a legend himself who started playing the piano at age nine and became one of the most influential pianists in the history of jazz.Out of the eleven tracks, six are Thelonious Monk's original compositions which includes his very famous ""'Round Midnight,"" a jazz staple that has been recorded more than a thousand times by great jazz instrumentalists and singers.""Sweet And Lovely"" has been one of my favorite jazz pieces of all-time. I simply love this tune, it is very melodic and the title really speaks for itself. ""I Didn't Know About You"" is also a track to adore and ditto with ""Body And Soul"" and ""Darn That Dream.""Listen to this CD with warm and welcoming ears and you'll surely enjoy the beautiful music it brings, which is just perfect on a breezy Spring night such as this.Have a sweet and lovely listening experience!"
2,Not a good solution for most,"Let me start with the biggest negative BY FAR - the case SCRATCHES your iPod. I have a 40GB 4G and when you press the iPod in snuggly it fits great - but just putting the iPod in and out scratches both the bottom white portion and the LCD screen. This is pretty much the opposite of what you want when you are buying a protective case. The idea is great and it looks cool. The flipstand works well and I like the fact that the clickwheel is available. If you are looking to put the iPod in the case and never (rarely) take it out, then it could be an OK solution. Just be aware that even if you are very careful (which I was) it will likely scratch your 3 to 6 hundred dollar investment. If you want to use the dock, you will be taking the iPod out of the case and you should look for a different case."
2,Book of critiques?,"The book should be called The Encylopedia of My Fantasy Critiques. Who wants to buy a book full of critiques? What sort of overstuffed person would write one? Maybe if you want to try some fantasy stuff but first want to hear someone elses opinion, this may be good for you. In short, this book is badly mistitled."
1,A Mess,"I was looking forward to reading this book so I was very disappointed to find it congested with illegible terminology which the authors have invented for themselves which keeps you flipping back to the glossary, by the time you've finished doing that and going through the labyrinthine cross indexing you've forgotten what you were looking up. I don't know why the authors made this book so unwieldy, perhaps to appease frowning academics."
2,Ls Angel Voices - Kit EDI with Cards,"The angels meaning is too short. It does not explain the meaning of a card if it comes head down. It also does not explain, how many times the querent can draw the seven cards. The cards supposedely talk about the past and the future but what about the present moment in life? it would be helpful a complete book with a detail explanation on how to manage, read and interpret the cards. i'm looking for it."
4,Great gift for American Chopper fans!,My nephew lives and breathes this show. He absolutely loved the book.
1,OK MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT!!!,We all know of there hit song (El Vanao) well some of us do. great song good to dance to I would not say it's Quebradita not Banda not Merenge not Tango or Norteno I don't know. It's a group of all I guess but thats it the group is the key thing here you would think such a good song they did the whole cd would be great. I mean it wasent just a hit but a super hit of it's time and they still play it every now and then but wrong!!! about the cd being good man it stinks!!! and when I say it stinks I mean like (Tito Nueves) stinks!!! it's just not a good buy not unless you like that song (El Vanao) alot and I mean alot!!! This cd I think deserved the rating I gave it. I feel that even a 1 was well... ok mabe it's a 1 but i'm telling you I know you got to hear knew things to see what you like about stuff but man don't waste your money on this cd. sorry (Los Cantantes) where did you guys come from planet loser!!!
2,"""Helpful"" is not the word for this dictionary","I purchased this dictionary because my Filipino teacher reccomended it on her syllabus. I found some of the pages copied poorly, making it difficult to see how some words were spelled. If there are several Tagalog words for one English word they will show one in a sentence but not describe the difference of the other words. For someone new to the language I found the dictionary a little bit helpful and a lot frustrating."
1,BOOK,Dear Sirs/Madamsdont shop online at Amazon you will not get what you want thay ROB me off this book i will not shop on amazon again.Yours Chris.
5,Another Amazing Work!,"This album is definitely another evolution for a band, you have to love a band that is able to continually reinvent themselves and yet maintain the soul that makes them who they are. The Cranes are a rare band that can do just that. The album has traded in the hard edge of ""Lilies"" and ""Clear"" and decided to make a bunch of tracks that could easily be theme songs to strange creatures that wander outside your window at night, almost deliciously evil sounding at times. Jim, again, proves that he is an excellent musician, and Alison's unique vocals creep into your soul. They compliment each other greatly on this album. Make sure to listen to ""Don't wake me up"" and ""Submarine."""
1,Needs to be remastered,"I love a lot of the old movies , I just wish they would remaster these movies and make them in color. I felt the picture quality was not there."
3,Decent debut album - 3.5 stars,"AMG comes with his extra funky jazzed up hyped beats & one dirty mouth, most of the songs on here are about sex (that goes along with being a buddy of DJ Quik). The album is decent but he says some lines that'll make you laugh til you cry. It has a few good songs but most are decent at best. The beats are tight though.

J. Lewis - Compton, CA - 1972"
2,See his HBO special? Then you've heard all the jokes,"I like Lewis Black's work, I must have seen that special on HBO over a dozen times and listened to his bits as they are now being played on Sirius Radios comedy channel. The man is dead on in his skewering of whatever target he sees fit to aim his wit at.But I was expecting more humor and less autobiography. I learned a bit about what kind of upbringing gives life to an amazing comic, but that wasn't why I got this book....I wanted to laugh.OK, maybe my title is a bit harsh, but most of the funny parts were taken from his stand up special he did for HBO. I was hoping for more new laughs, not the same jokes reworded and in print.If an autobiography is what you are looking for, this is your book. Looking for comedy on every page? Not so much...."
1,Blacked Out From Boredom.........,"Lewis Black is a hilarious stand up comedian. He is one of the few comedians that I have laughed so hard at, I thought I would wet my pants. I had high expectations from his book.Apparently, I shouldn't have.The first chapter or two had a couple mildly funny things in them. From then on out, it was simply a boring autobigraphical story. I really didn't care about his theater interests. They aren't funny. The other topics he chose weren't funny either. Towards the end he included a good portion of his stand up routine in writing.... already heard that.I definitely wouldn't buy this book. Thank goodness the library is free. This book really was a waste of time. I'll look forward, instead, to future stand up routines ( and be near a bathroom)."
4,back to the sixties,Shades of my youth. This cleared up a lot of questions about the leaders of the protest movement of the sixties. But where are they now. I love it that Black is out there yelling at us.
3,"Deeper, but not as funny as I would have thought","Black isn't a lunatic stand-up comic in this book. He talks a lot about the sixties, drugs, and growing up. The humor is definitely Black, but you are not going to be roaring with laughter all the way through (which is what I was hoping for)."
4,Funny and Smart,"Lewis Black is the funniest man in America. If you're a fan, you'll recognize some of this material from his stand-up act and frankly, it's better straight from his mouth. That said, there's a lot of great stuff here and I had a great time reading it. His voice comes through loud and clear. If you're the type that's easily offended, heed the warnings in the front of the book. He's not kidding."
3,Get the audiobook!,"I have the audiobook (bought hardcover for a friend) and you miss alot of the flair that Lewis Black delivers in print. If you are a fan of his CD's you'll recognize a few of the stories, but the stories beyond just the humor really give depth to one of my favorite comedians. I'm glad he wrote the book, but I would have miss his amazing skill of delivery if I'd read the book."
3,"It's real, it's funny, and it's real funny","This is a memoir of Lewis Black's life. Some of it is really funny, some of it isn't. A lot of it is very informative and interesting historical facts that Lewis Black experienced growing up and going to college in the 60s. Although I found the college years portion of this audiobook least interesting, I did enjoy the whole thing."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"If I had known that this book was just a bunch of stuff from his stand up acts thrown into writing, I would have saved the money. There were some things about him that I didn't know before (most of the stuff about college and his brother) but other than that, I could recite it word for word from his routines. Maybe I'm just a big fan and I've seen all of his acts more than a few times...but that is why I bought the book. I gave it a 3 because I just couldn't give Lewis Black anything below that. I did appreciate the stuff that wasn't from a routine and it wasn't a poorly written book."
3,Stick To Standup.,As we all know Lewis Black is a fantastic Stand Up comic (If not why would we have read his book?). Unfortunately his unique comic delivery doesnt translate well into writing. The stories and commentary contained within the book are amusing but nothing makes you really want to laugh out loud. His background in theatre & hippie life is a surprising discovery and the book is a very quick read. I would say read the book but borrow it from the library as its not a keeper.
5,READ THE STANDUP ACT,"I'm a relatively newcomer to the comedy of Lewis Black but I'm a big fan already. His standup shows on Comedy Channel and HBO have been brilliant. The book is much like reading his stand-up act as he gives you that scouring, aggitated view point on so many different subjects. What I like about Black is that you can't qualify him politically. He goes after the Right, the Left, and the In-between with full vim and vigor. And religion is certainly not spared either. Black even gives you takes on his one family showing there there truly is ""nothing sacred'. There's plenty of his rants to go around.I found myself laughing at loud in several spots in this book. It's short but it's a blast. Cleverly written and dead on target on so many things. I see Black as the heir to be to George Carlin's throne as the top stand-up."
5,Lewis Black is America's Sacred Treasure!,"This audio book is a semi-autobiographical- and a compilation of thoughts by Lewis Black. And let me tell you, it is automatically my favorite book ever. Even though I have the audio book, but I also bought the book. Lewis has many insightful thoughts in this book, and it is incorporated with great humor. You'll love it."
5,hilarious and poignant,"I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show and one of my favorite segments is Lewis Black's segment, so I ran out and bought his book when it was published. And it doesn't disappoint. It's part memoir, part satire, part rant, and very funny, but it is funny in and intelligent way. You have to have the right sense of humor for this book. If you voted for Bush, don't bother buying this. But if you like intelligent, insightful humor, then this book is definitely for you."
2,BORING!,"I'm sorry, but this book is most definitely a SNORE-FEST! First of all, if you're expecting this book to be mostly new material of Black's comic observations, it most certainly is not! The majority of the book is a pretty damn boring autobiography! And the few parts of the book that aren't boring autobiography consist mostly of Black's recycled material! For me, at least, what makes most of Black's comedy funny (or at least a lot funnier) is his comedic delivery, which of course you can't get in a book. Bottom line: ONLY read this book if you want to know about Black's pretty boring life, but I warn you--it's not very funny at all!"
1,dull,"I bought this thinking it would be a funny take on current events, like his comedy. It's his life story, and it's really not that funny."
1,Don't.,"If you enjoy Lewis Black's stand-up routine and enjoy watching him on Comedy Central, you may be surprised to discover, he's written quite possibly the most boring book ever published. I listened to the audiobook, and it was like having Black himself telling me over and over what a bad decision I'd made.There should be a warning label. ""Warning: Do Not File Under Humor.""This is NOT a humor book. This is an outrageously boring memoir of the high school, college and post-graduate years of an ordinary person who happens to be a comedian. I swear he even writes about being in student government. Student government!For those expecting a funny book, this is a serious bait-and-switch. I almost feel like it's some kind of creepy joke. I found myself wondering how many book editors tried to kill themselves while reading it.I don't know you, but I'm doing you a favor. I'm helping you improve your life by telling you this: if you were considering reading this book or listening to the audiobook... don't!"
4,Love Lewis Black,Great book!!! I am a big fan of Lewis Black and now when I can't see him in concert or on TV I can read his jokes!!!
4,Definitely worth reading,"Great book by itself, terrific insight into what it was like growing up in the 60s and early 70s, however, do to watching many lewis black comedy specials, I found myself bored during the roughly 1/4 of the book were he simply repeated his past material."
3,Disappointing,This book was a bit disappointing. I was expecting a hilarious story from start to finish. What I really got was an autobiography of his early years. The big fans of Lewis Black will love this book. You really get to know who he is. After reading this book you will understand what makes him tick and why he is who he is. There is a few good stories. I loved his description of working for the government. It made me laugh out loud. The other part is nice to know but a bit of a disappointment.
4,Great Read,"Mr. Black mixes the story of his childhood through college years with his classic rants on everyday subject. He has lived an interesting life coming from the suburbs of Washington D.C. I learned a lot about the man behind the yelling and had a few laughs on the way. If you want to know more about Lewis Black, this is the book to buy."
1,I wish I could rate it less,"I loved the book. I like Tom Robbins. I like Gus Van Sant. But whenever I think of amateurish, idiotic, incompetent filmmaking, this movie immediately leaps to mind. I might see it again just for the sheer horror...you really feel BAD for these people who signed on to this project. Only John Hurt hit the mark in this movie with his portrayal of the Countess.Really, I looked up the worst movie I could think of to see what kind of rating Amazon.com users gave it (these reviews are overwhelmingly positively skewed). At least they didn't give it five stars."
2,Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"It was to hard to follow. I love Uma movies. This one, I didn't finish watching after falling asleep on it, maybe, halfway through."
1,Bored Me Half to Death,"I give the movie one star for effort. I have nature films of cranes of all types and prefer to watch those. My partner has this movie and loves it. I really did my best to keep my mind open and enjoy the movie but was met with deep disappointment. First of all it was boring! I never knew what they were getting at. It was horrible to watch them spinning chickens in the air, I presume a live tranquilized one. And the bit with the big thumbs so she could hitch hike better than anyone. Give me a break! The flock of birds flying to freedom was a nice touch. That's the reason I gave it one star. The birds outshined the movie. I know everyone likes different movies but in my opinion, save your money. Maybe you can play it the next time you have difficulty sleeping at night and catch a snooze. I'm glad I didn't have to sit through it at the theatre."
3,"If you like ordinary, this is not for you","If you enjoy the absurd, you should like this. Unexpected and entertaining--enough truth to make one a little discouraged with humankind. This film stuck in the back of my mind for years."
2,The book is much better.,"First of all I read the book and then saw the movie. If you are planning on doing this then I'd say that you will be very disappointed. I loved the book and hated the movie. The book is about 420 pages long and the movie is like a clip show of the book. Highlighting the major parts of the book.I don't know if Gus Van Sant meant to leave out some of the (what I thought) best parts of the book because he felt that people should read the book or because the producers felt that an 140 mins. was enough. They left out my favorite parts with description of the ""Clockpeople"" and the and the ending in the book is great, and in the movie a couple main parts of the ending where left out. If you haven't read the book then do and don't see the movie, and if you don't like to read then just watch the movie. The only thing I enjoyed was the casting. I love Tom Robbins books', and I think it's just sad what they did to this movie."
3,"if it's sloppy, eat it over the sink","Even cowgirls get the blues is a terrific adaption of Robbins' book of the same title. Having read the book, I must say that this is one of the best adaptions that I have seen so far. I'm not quite sure if this film could be as greatly appreciated without having read the book. The characters are painted here precisely as described. Sissy(Uma Thurman) and her gigantic thumbs are just as you could have imagined. Bonanza Jellybean(Rain Phoenix) is an unforgettable character, her strength and cockiness makes you giggle with delight. The chink and his oh-so-meaningful sayings get you thinking. This film is amusing and I can recommend to anyone who dreams of cowgirls and love. well gosh, cause even cowgirls get the blues.."
1,GEEZ!!!,I love gus van sant movies and although i had read just how bad this movie really is i thought i would go against all the comments and see it for myself...but now i wish i hadn't...this movie is truly terrible and has no REAL storyline that is either meaninful or either to follow...it is a mess from beginning to end..and although it did have great potential and much much much much much more could have been done with it..i was greatly dissapointed and would not recomended it to anyone...his other movies are much more inventive and enjoyable.
2,Hold on to your hats!,"A zany fun ride with a talented cast. Unfortunately the wonderful ""love theme"" of the book gets lost in the film. I know what I know and Tibet is Tibet."
1,The definition of stupid!,Where to begin? I am watching this video for my women's studies class. Why? I'm sorry but this story has no plot. I don't understand anything that's going on in the movie. Where did Tom Robbins come up with such stupid ideas?
4,Good story,"For those who, like me, are just discovering Jack McDevitt this book is well worth reading. It takes a point of view (early on anyway) that is not often done in science fiction, namely that we are alone in the universe. I was especially struck with the author's ability to make the reader *feel* what it might be like when we finally get out into the galaxy and discover that there is not only no other intelligent life but no other life of any kind--not even an amoeba. His portrayal of the effects that kind of discovery would have is as convincing as it is unsettling--which is to say very, on both counts.As to the rest of the book its a pretty good story, it certainly held my attention to the end. Well worth the time it takes to read."
2,Disappointing,"What's up with this book? With Eternity Road, Moonfall and Ancient Shores I was so engrossed that I could hardly put them down. This book, Infinity Beach, is so slow and boring that I'm still not finished after a month or so. I've read many other novels since I started this one. I'm half way through and it still hasn't grabbed my interest. I might have to give up on it entirely."
3,"Not bad... but not his greatest, either","The beginning of the book was a bit slow. However, once Kim really begins her investigation into Emily's death and unique facts begin to be uncovered, the pace really picks up. The book also explores some really unique questions about life in the universe. I enjoyed the book a great deal, although a few parts were a bit tedious. It admittedly took me a long time to get through this book. I began it back in May and I read it on it piece-meal through May and June. There were several weeks where this book sat ignored. It wasn't until July that I really got into the book and read it voraciously.Some of the characters were quite memorable, although it seemed at times there were a lot of characters to keep up with. Unfortunately, a lot ran together. Even at the end of the book, some of the characters were still ""just a name"" to me. This flaw was overshadowed by how powerful some of the main characters were, however."
4,McDevitt is up to his usual high standards!,"As a friend of Jack's, I read this in manuscript form last year. This novel is incredibly well-plotted, with lots of action and suspense. You won't be disappointed. If you're not already a McDevitt fan, read this and you will be. Jack McDevitt is a major SF talent."
1,Infinity Blech,"Briefly, I could not get through 30% of this book; the characters were pasteboard, the settings were bland (terraformed worlds tend to be like that), and the pace dragged (as far as I read)....I peeked ahead and was dismayed that the main character was still stumbling over the same plots devices and still mumbling the same drek about longing for her long-disappeared sister. Jeez, that got old quick!How could a former Navy officer write a science-fiction chick-flick-book? Must have been really boring checking customs IDs in North Dakota.So I thought I would advise anyone potentially considering..but my hands are getting heavy..must warn readers..can't keep typing..eyelids lowering..head..sinking..ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,good yarn but not his best,"I've liked every McDevitt book I've read so far including this one. In this case most of the story is enjoyable but every now and then it seems as if the characters are forced to make some astoundingly unlikely decisions in order to keep the plot following the outline the author had prepared ahead of time. For example, on two separate occasions, two otherwise intelligent characters are heard to utter virtually the same foolish statement as they lurch into harm's way with predictable results. I also found the main character somewhat unsympathetic (which is not the case in his other stories). If you like McDevitt you will like this book (but maybe not as much as some of his others)."
5,Great story,I want to visit Cabry beach! This was a great story with solid characters. I am reading thru all of McDevitt's books and this is my favorite
1,"Great idea, poor execution","McDevitt is a master of creating a mystery of cosmological proportions. When he is on, as for ""Engines of God"", the result is a poignant expoloration of the human condition within the context of the universe.Unfortunately, Infinity Beach falls quite short of these expectations. The beginning is wonderful, but then the execution of the idea fails. Character development is pedantic, and more time is spent on the actual footwork of solving the mystery, rather than developing the main theme of the novel.In short, the characters were un-memorable and it was a struggle to finish the book. If you want to experience the author at his best, my opinion is that you should read Engines of God."
4,"Fast Paced, Fun, and Clever","Part whodunit and part sci-fi, Infinity Beach is a fun and engrossing read. Sometimes the logic seems a bit slippery and the characters a little flat; but the main character is sufficiently sympathetic to guide you through the book. If you are looking for a ""hard"" sci-fi account of first contact, try _A Deepness in the Sky_. If you want more of a noir detective novel on the same topic; this is the book for you."
2,It's All Down Hill From Here,"Okay, first of all I'm a big fan of Jack's. The first book I read of his was The Engines of God. I'd give that 4.5 stars. It's still my favorite. I've read every book since and similar to Niven and Pournelle the quality of work declines the more Jack writes. This last book was down right boring. Where's the ""ACTION""? The plot just rolled on and on with no action or intrigue. Even the ending left much to be desired. Based on how bad this latest effort was, I may pass on reading his next book. Jack needs to realize that it's quality not quantity. Pumping out a book every year doesn't make you a great author."
2,Bleh,"I can't agree with the other reviews. I was unimpressed with the main character, who came across wishy-washy and a slave to a plot who's mystery was no mystery whatsoever. The setting was also fairly generic, coming across more space fantasy than science fiction. All in all, I can't really recommend this book."
5,great read!,"As usual, Jack provides you with a great read. I enjoyed the character growth of the heroine in Infinity Beach. She starts out actually comfortable in her life while she expresses that she would like to do more in her degreed profession. When push comes to shove, she doesn't want to change. So she is a reluctant heroine. Then she drags in another-who is as reluctant. I enjoyed getting to know those two characters very much.I enjoyed the tension of their relationship.The perception of clone development was interesting. The development of their personalities was similar to twins. As I raised twins, I saw the similarities. Before reading the book, I would have put clones in more of a mirror image, if I had thought about it at all.The reality of what happened was good. A bit of a surprise but one that fit right in with the characters. I do so love his character driven books. And the aliens? Well, you will just have to read it to find out!"
2,Too slow,"I got to page 100 and gave up. It's not that bad mind you just so slow. I have read reviews that say the beginning is good and then it trails off... ouch! It's one of those books that I just did not care what was written on the next page. If you can't keep my attention after 100 pages...That being said, I will give this author another shot with another book."
3,It was ok...,"This was my first Jack McDevitt book and I was a little disappointed. The book did make for an interesting read, however it wasn't a real page turner for me."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a SETI novel, but on an expanded scale. There is a mystery as well, in finding out what exactly happened to a mission that went out looking, and failed, so none have been sent since.Also, humanity is doing some serious advertising of their presence. They blow up stars so people might notice where they are.When people that survived the failed mission start dying, one violently, you realise something is being hidden."
2,Good content - suffers from too many errors,I wish the proof readers of the book would have done a better job. The potential to be an excellent piece of work on the topic is lost by the numerous errors in several chapters.
2,Unfortunate book release,"Dimensional Management, written by Mark A Curtis unforntunately has too many spelling errors to be considered as a learning tool in any University program.I believe it was Mr. Curtis himself who stated once, ""If you have more than two spelling errors in your resume, the company reading your resume will immediately discard the resume""."
3,Dimensional Management Introductory Text,"The text by Mr. Curtis is a satisfactory introduction to Dimensional Management (DM). However, it does suffer from some much needed proofreading. Many diagrams are erroneous, and some text errors are obvious. I want to give the text the benefit of the doubt, as it does provide a good foundation for DM concepts. Frankly, there are not too many textbooks dedicated to this topic (e.g. Dimensioning and Tolerancing Handbook by Paul Drake being another), so it serves the purpose as intended. It is a generally easy read, and being just under 200 pages, one can cover the text in 2-3 days. It also discusses and provides examples of Tolerancing Analysis software, which is another tool the Designer or Engineer can use in his/her product designs."
2,I was robbed,"I read the first Nick Hoffman mystery and considered it fairly good. I didn't read the ones in between that one and Little Miss Evil, but if they were like this one, I consider it no loss. The main plot was weak, mainly because of the topsy-turvy structure of putting the murder last. The subplots were weak and did not tie in. As a cancer survival, I was particulary put off by the insensitive way the topic was handled. It was all too clear that the author spent only enough time to read an article, pick out a few terms, and sprinkle them into the subplot. The story was a hodgepodge. The author owes me."
1,Too underdone.,"I'm not surprised that so many of the reviews have dealt with the late positioning of the murder. I was distrated by it but only because what led up to it didn't capture and hold my attention. It started with the first chapter which was just a drawn-out string of references about cooking. Diane Mott Davison (Tough Cookie, Prime Cut)is much better with her protagonist, Goldy Schultz, at blending receipes into the narrative while serving up a good mystery. Part of the plot of Little Miss Evil dealt with the reoccurring appearance of the threatening note, YOU DESERVE TO DIE. Well, about half-way through, I was thinking the same thing about this pitiful mystery."
1,Hated it,"What kind of whodunnit murder mystery plods clumsily along almost to the end before the murder is even committed? Answer: a poor excuse for one, and that's just what this book was. If that's not bad enough, the solution was woefully obvious, and that's coming from me, someone who needs a map to find his way to the bathroom. Raphael attempts to be comical and engaging in the dialogue but he doesn't have the deft ear of R.D. Zimmerman, for example. In fact, any reader looking for a great gay protagonist with creative crime-solving capabilities should forget this Nick Hoffman novel all together in favor of a master such as Zimmerman's Todd Mill series."
1,Not even close,"Raphael did a disservice to the entire genre by palming Little Miss Evil off as a mystery. By no stretch was it anything of the kind. Raphael is noted for boasting about being an escaped academic. The escape was only physical because he took with him a sophomoric tactic that college students are infamous for: padding a composition to gloss over the lack of substance. The dialogue between Nick and Stephan was more syrupy and inane than anything ever served up by Ozzie & Harriet. Predicting the direction of the plot was akin to doing the same for a mountain---you knew it wasn't going to move. How the publisher allowed itself to be part of this scam against readers is baffling. If it was part of a strategy to play out the remainder of a contract, I'm half-forgiving; provided, of course that the publisher now sends Raphael packing to peddle this padscratchings elsewhere."
4,An Appreciative Reader,"In this fourth book of murderous events at SMU we have the advantage of being well into the story and the continued development of strong and interesting characters before the murder takes place. I very much liked the plotting, the sense of place that the author creates, and the atmosphere of the university. Even though I am no relation to the author, I have grown quite fond of Nick and Stefan (and cousin Sharon as well) and look forward to the next installment."
1,GREAT,"IM GERMAN SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THIS PRODUCT . IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE LABEL . IT DEFENATLY WORKS FOR ME , USUALLY WHEN I TAKE IT , IT WORKS WITH IN MINUTES , IT IS GREAT A GREAT PRODUCT ."
5,Fabulous book for all ages!,"Well, I'm not a teenager, yet I must say I LOVED this! The author's unique voice is fresh and will appeal to the younger crowd, too. This would be a great book for mothers and daughters to enjoy together. Besides being a fun read, this book contains much depth that would make it an excellent book club selection, with discussion questions already included in the book. Highly recommended to all!"
5,Good stuff,"What a fun time getting into the world of Abby! Jackie does a superb job capturing the jumbly, honest, angst-filled life of a thirteen year old girl. At times painful, other times hilarious. A great coming of age story. Reminded me, at least tangetially of Alice Munro's ""Lives of Girls and Women."""
4,Wonderfully Written,"Wow--I finished this book in record time! The writing style is original and imaginitive, and I lost myself in the fast-paced story. I feel as if I spent a year inside Abby's head. I laughed, cried and was moved to share sentences like ""...washing his hands in the bathroom with integrity."" Can't wait for the next book!"
2,I'm a teenager and I'm able to form a cohesive sentence!,"While this book was an upsetting and heart-wrenching story, I couldn't get past the style of the writing. Dosen't anyone remember what it's like to be thirteen? I was unable to get into the book because I was so disgusted by the way Abby was portrayed. The author made her sound like she was at about the level of a six years old in most parts. I mean, wierdamundo? Please. Is this how adults really believe we think?"
4,an egg on 3 sticks,I REEAALLYY liked htis book but...i am 12 and it wasn't really fro my age group it got kinda bad at the end...and gross...lol...it was good...reaally good just it was a little (above my head) her having sex...getting pregnant at 15...the whole enchilada...
2,WEIRDAMUNDO!!!!,"I'll give you this, the storyline was fantastic, and the narrative of a 13-year old was superb. However, if I hear the word ""weirdamundo"" one more time, I think I will be sick. Using the slang of the teen was appropriate and did add much to the narration, but I think it was a little over-done. Enough of a good thing, already! ""Weirdamundo"" was used at least once, sometimes more, in every chapter. I get the point!! The over-usage of the word made me feel as if the author was trying a little too hard to convince the reader that a teenager was telling the story. I think I wasted my money! All of the reviews I had read were all in praise of this book. I was ""fooledamundo""."
2,batmington raquet,"it looks nice but doesn't feel right when using it, this is an amateur copy and only good for kid's use. not recommended for serious players."
2,Same quality as cheap badminton set,"These rackets are very similar to those you'd find in a set of four with net / birdies etc. I previously purchased a couple of Wilson rackets and was hoping to match the quality, while saving $3-4 each on these Halex rackets. I was mistaken and wish I'd spent the extram money on the Wilson rackets. Shoddy quality - the head on one of the rackets has already become loose from the handle and the netting is very loose. Just looking for some decent quality rackets to play with in the yard. These are fine for that purpose, but overpriced."
5,LIVING DREAMS,Lawrence shows us the interior life of stars. This is a first. Usually stars hide behind personnas. Lawrence lifts these veils and gets at the inner core of the stars dream lives. Particularly liked Paris Hilton before she became Paris Hilton.
1,Not the real cotton eyed joe,"This CD is all instrumentals (not by the original artists). If you're looking for the bar-room favorite version of Cotton Eyed Joe, this isn't it."
5,Texas Dance favorites,I had bought this album on cassette a long time ago and then found it at Amazon.I really like this CD.It makes me want to find the nearest Honky Tonk.
2,COLLAR REPLACED 3 TIMES IN ONE YEArR,"I PURCHASED THIS BLENDER TO MAKE FROZEN DRINKS. WITHIN ONE YEAR (1) THE COLLAR BROKERTHREE (3) TIMES. I WOULD RATE THIS BLENDER A 5 IF THE COLLAR DIDN'T CONSTANTLY SHATTER AS A RESULT OF CRUSHING ICE. IF YOU ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM, CHECK THE COLLAR FOR HAIRLINE BREAKS. THE BREAKS ARE NOT OBVIOUS UNTIL LIQUID COMES FLOWING OUT OF THE MODELS BASE."
1,Refurbished but broken parts,"Although it is refurbished, my unit came through with a broken collar as well as a broken feeder in the lid. Neither broken part was due to shipping damage. I returned it for full refund (thanks Amazon) and bought the Waring PBB201 (white) instead."
5,An album of emotions...,"It's not easy to find an album which can awake in me all these differents kind of emotions, not easy neither find a double album which I like all the songs, the strong of a theather show, the feeling of a pure heart, the simplicity of the perfection, that's how I feel this album, but it's not easy to understand the music of Peter Hammill, so don't try if you are not a very open minded person about music."
3,"Very critical, unusual account","Mr. Frisch spends most of his time criticizing the Nazi regime, castigating those responsible for not supplying the soldiers with warm clothes etc... It is certainly a unique take on the battles of the Eastern Front if not a particularly compelling one."
2,make it better---john kee,"I believe that John Kee is a genius, but has let down his listeners on his past few albums. He should vere off to a bit more traditional or more to contemporary, but none the less---the music all sounds the same usually from album to album. He should allow his musicians to write or get some help in from Fred, Donald, or Kirk."
1,Not John's Best work!,I was very disappointed with this project. Min. Kee appears to be filling a quota with this CD.
5,BARBARITO SHINES BY HIMSELF,"After playing as a guest for Juan De Marco's Afro Cuban All Stars and for the BVSC Barbarito delivers a wonderful masterpiece of his own, the music will just take you away. I was impress by Barbarito at a recent live performance, his musicians are young and they make a great combination with Barbarito this is definitly an album that you must have."
1,What is Magic About?,"After reading this book, I still haven't got a clue what magic is about. This one goes to the trash bin."
2,Adequate but slightly disappointing,"I'm not sure excatly why this failed to satisfy me. Certainly the film has all of the basic information and the short clips with his daughter (I wish her interview was more extended) are fascinating. Possibly it's that the narrator's voice is uninteresting or perhaps it's because so little of Chaliapin's singing is used. In any case, it is not a bad effort, but simply one which will have to do until a better one is available."
4,Blue Magic CD,"This is a classic Album. The one noticable difference from the original Album is ""Tear it Down"". The orignal was done differently at the end, prior to the real long note in the song. Still good."
2,Boring!!!,"This book is regarded as a classic, but the writing style is as soporific as can be. Some scientists should read Gamow or Feynman to learn that one can write a piece of work that's both authoritative and entertaining."
4,must have,"If you're interested in teaching and/or learning about homiletics, you gotta know about Walter Burghardt.Wish it had been available in DVD."
2,"Poor battery life, stuck notes","At first, this controller worked great. After a couple hours of use however, the batteries were dead. I replaced the batteries (SIX AA!!) and after using it a while I noticed some notes get stuck (some notes randomly sustain indefinitely, most likely the note-off midi message never reaches the computer.) I contacted the m-audio tech support and their solution was to power the controller with the supplied ac adaptor (making it no longer wireless.) Soon after the batteries ran out again, after only another couple hours of use, and I had the bright idea of putting in rechargable batteries. DON'T TRY THIS. The ones I tried got stuck and now one is jammed in forever. This isn't a very reliable keyboard, whether it be limitations in wireless technology or not. Expect to pay a lot for batteries. I would recommend a Keyrig 25 as a wired alternative."
3,"Maybe there's no ""perfect breed""?","I would rate this volume four stars for information, except that there's little on inherited health issues, but only two stars for tone. After reading every section on the twenty or so breeds I was considering, I found myself becoming quite discouraged; it seemed that every breed demonstrated one or more characteristics that should discourage any potential owner from making a purchase. From the point of view of some breeders, this might be seen as a useful purpose, but I was certainly looking for something more positive. The book relies on sketches of each breed rather than photographs."
3,The yang to another book's yin...,"Remember the drill sergeant in ""Full Metal Jacket"" who said that he didn't discriminate against any race or ethnic group? He assured the recruits that ""you are all equally worthless in my sight."" That sort of sums up this book. The authors are dog trainers so they are faced most often with negative behavior in the breeds. Their conclusion is, in almost every case, that all of the dog breeds are bad and it would just be safer for everyone if you didn't get one.Still, the book serves as a valuable counterweight to some of the other ""sunshine pumping"" books out there. Just like when teenagers fall in love, we don't always consider a dog breed with our eyes open. This book is the equivalent of your mother slapping you in the face and telling you to ""snap out of it."" If you know the downside of the breed and still want it, then that's probably true love, isn't it?"
5,Excellent advice,"This is a no nonsense approach to owning and living with the variety of dog breeds that are out there. The writers are practical, straightforward and honest about each breed's qualities and pitfalls. I have recommended and shared this book with a number of people. All have appreciated the writer's candor. The pictures for each breed are drawn, which is a bit odd, but this isn't supposed to be a picture book; there are other tomes out there for that. This book is a bit dated at this point (2011) as there have been other breeds recognized by the AKC since the initial publication, but the advice is still sound."
1,Buyer Beware!,"In a sentence: THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! If you plan on buying a dog, please turn to a different source for information on breeds. The ideas contained in this book are so far off, so wrong, so ridiculous, that it is absolutely offensive! If you don't believe me, ask your local vet or a good breeder/trainer. This book does not even deserve one star!"
3,"Interesting, but way overwritten","I love movies and was looking forward to reading about some of my own favorites in this book. What was disappointing was the writing, which was pedantic, redundant, and lifeless. As a writer myself, and a writing teacher, I kept wondering why in the world Anker's editor didn't get him on track. This book could have conveyed the same information and ideas in half the words. No kidding. As Mark Twain said, ""I would have written a shorter letter, but I didn't have the time."" I'm on my way to reading a couple other Christian perspectives on movies and hoping they are a little more lively."
1,Looking at Self in the Movies,"This text is too evangelically Christian for anyone with their own mind. The author's interpretations are limited to this evangelical viewpoint, only highlighting his own theology, not the theology in the text of the film. If you're not an evangelical Christian, you will not appreciate the massive interpretations of this book."
3,Overcoming Teen Depression,Again have not had a chance to read - but am a little disappointed that I did not look at the copyright date (2001) I believe the information may be outdated - DH
2,Raggedy Ann not in the story,"I wish i had known before buying this that this is NOT really a book of Raggedy Ann stories. It is a collection of quaint fairy tale-type stories written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle in the 1920s, and so for the collector it may be interesting, but if you want stories with Ann and Andy, you would be disappointed. Also, it should be noted that this same book also appears under the title ""Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy's Very Own Fairy Stories"""
2,"Very Good Music, Poor Sound Quality","Here is another disc that has been mastered poorly, most tracks have mastering induced clipping and distortion as well as a severely limited dynamic range: in short, they sound like a loudness war victim. I don't know if the tracks were all mastered by one one guy, or if the remixers gave the finished tracks to Domino. It wouldn't surprise me if it was the artists themselves mastering these things so badly, as volume is king and most artists are terrified of having a quiet track--even if it means making it sound bad. Sound quality is not something most artists think of, it is almost always them telling the mastering guy to make it as loud as possible. They all want to have the same levels as the latest Miley Cyrus album despite the damage done to the music. Sometimes I wonder if they even care how their art (or should I say product) sounds.Look up 'loudness war' for more info."
3,not bad but not good,"this skin is not really good because it doesnt have a screen protection, also if you wanna use the ITRIP, you have to take the IPOD out from the Skin....although it protects the 90% of the IPODif you really wanna protect your IPOD, i recommend the ISkin...go to www.iskin.com...its more expensive but it really works..."
1,Does Not Fit A 40 Gigabyte iPod,"I really liked the design of this product, but it does not fit my 40 gig photo iPod at all. It gapes around all the openings, and is stretched to more of an oval around the circular click will. I can see that it would be great for a 20 gig model, but think they need to update the design for the higher capacity Ipods."
3,It does it's job,"This skin is easy to put on and does it's job. I am discovering that the clear skin does start to look dingy after a while, althought I haven't tried cleaning it. I also don't like that I have to flip up the bottom flap to plug it in because I use it with a car charger a lot and the flap gets in the way of the touch wheel; and there is no screen protection with this skin."
3,WAIT! Buy the Speck with armband instead,"I got this skin with the armband for $24. I haven't had a chance to use the armband yet, so I can't speak for that, but I can only assume it's a better deal to get both for the same price.As for the Skin itself, I haven't been bumping it around yet, either, but I don't think it compares favorably to my Contour Design Showcase ($22). I spent a lot of time deliberating over cases, and the Showcase seems much sturdier, or at least more substantial. The front (which covers, blessedly, the screen) is rigid plastic, rather than the Skin's gel plastic, and the sides are grippy and hard. I feel more confident about it protecting my iPod than I do about the Skin; I only plan on using the Speck Skin with the armband, and will stick to the Showcase otherwise."
2,"Its ok, but not the big thing","The material is really good, but the design is awful, it does not take care of all sides of the IPod and it soon will break because of its poor design. It was shipped very fast."
5,Pyle 8inch sub woof woof,"My shipment was expedited! Wow!I ordered 2 8 inch Pyle sub woofers in a tube.I received both items with in a few days.They were packaged well, a box inside a box filled with ballooned bubble plastic.Very easily installation~ took me less than 5 minutes!!!!!I could tell right off that they were working when I turned the bass down on the stereo and cranked it up.They fit right between the rear seats, fit perfectly out of site and not in the way.Just enough bass and quality sound for whom ever is riding will surely enjoy.Thank you and next time I need some audio equipment, I will be looking your way!!!!"
1,a waste of money,hello i recently purchased this sub tube and it blew out the same day i hooked it up and it tells you its 400watts but i hooked it up to a 100 watt amp and it blew and then if you want to repair with the warranty it will cost you up to 20 dollers to send it in its just a peace of garbag waste of money and time thank you for nothing
3,booms a little,"My own fault that I picked this up without an amplifier, I thought it was self amplified. The amp I hooked up could be why it distorts a little with bigger booms, but it does fine for the basic music bass."
1,PYLE of trash,"If I could rate this product a ZERO, I would. The subwoofer tube arrived in a new/unopened box, sealed from the factory. Upon installation, it worked good for approximately 15minutes. The speaker then blew and became distorted. Although the seller provided excellent customer support, I will NEVER order a PYLE product again. In this case, you truly get what you pay for!!"
5,One Tough Little Subwoofer,"This is an amazing subwoofer. I installed one in my son's 2000 Mustang to compliment a Dual XHD7411 and 200 watt Clarion amp in a tri-mode configuration. I'm not big on an over bearing and distorted thump, thump, thump so I am pleased how this subwoofer hits at the right time and the right amount. If you adjust your amp properly you will feel and hear wonderful bass and not a vibrating disaster. This subwoofer is nicely constructed and well worth the price. The free shipping was very fast. I'm totally satisified and my son enjoys the extra kick it has added to his stereo system. This is one tough little subwoofer. Very, very nice."
4,good boom for the buck,I have a 200 watt amp hooked up to it and it sounds great. I was a little leary because of the price but it sounds great and it fits behind my truck seat seat perfectly. I am very pleased with the no rattle base.
1,DONT BUY.,Dont buy this item. It says it can hold 400 watts but I used my 300 watt amp and as soon as I turned it on the subwoofer blew and didnt work. The speaker cone came disconnected from the coil.. making it useless.
5,"Solid Construction, Great Price!!!","I'm completely satisfied with this set up, not only for the price but for the performance. The enclosure is well build and attractive. The sound isn't crazy loud like some other higher end subs but for the price you're paying you can't expect competition type performance. For all of you out there complaining about blowing out the sub on this enclosure clearly don't understand the proper way to tune your sub. 400 Watts means it's rated to peak at that level, running a 280 watt RMS amp and cranking up the gain is going to get your sub ruined in mintues. Even if you're an amature and blow things up right away just go out and purchase a more expensive subwoofer and use the enclosure. In the end it's still worth it."
2,Must use this under specs or it will blow!!!,"I read the same reviews previous to my purchase... for the money it was worth a try, and the results are... blew the speaker after the second song, long story short the speaker is not up to the specs listed and notice you will not find rms info. note that after you pay for shipping and the restocking fee assiciated with return policy at pyle its not worth my time to bother even calling pyle for a rma number. stay way under specs or you'll have a cool tube to put a nice kicker in"
1,Stay Away,"The only reason this P.O.S. even gets one star is for the tube itself (and that is the lowest rating available). The tube is sturdy and perfect for when you need to replace the subwoofers that come with it. I sadly am still the owner of THREE of these sad, blown, and fried subwoofers. Please, do yourself a favor and stay away. Will update later on how the tubes sound with better subs in them."
4,Very cool DVD,"Good collection of Moby's music, the videos really show his creative and funny side. Some of the videos are bizarre cartoons, like the one where Moby as the man in the moon visits a Louisiana swamp and dances with an alien girl."
4,It could've had more if you compare to The Chem. Bros. DVD,"Overall, I really thought the videos could've been a little more creative and unique. Some of the videos were just kind of weird in my opinion, and the good ones I never really called good, I just thought they were ok. Some of the TV spots were good, like the one where Moby performs ""Go"" LIVE, that was impressive and was also the first time I have heard the song ""Go"" in general. The MEGAMIX I thought was poor, a lot of the mixes and remixes were very dull and could've been a lot better considering there were some remakes of some of Moby's songs that were just slaughtered."
3,WHERE THE SOUTHSIDE.,"I started to like moby after seeing the southside video. I bought the CD and when i heard there was a DVD, i bought it. I feel like the wendys ladie, WHERE IS SOUTHSIDE. If you want the southside video, just download it. I would only buy the DVD if your a big moby fan."
3,Plenty of Moby for everyone,"Prepare to be saturated in the audio and visual world of Moby. Whether or not that is a good thing is up to you. The dvd has a good live set of 5 or 6 songs, a 1 1/2 hour ""mexamix"" (really the gem of the dvd), some home video shot by and starring Moby, and other neat things. I like Moby, but not enough to enjoy every bit of the dvd. Perhaps that is the beauty of it: there is plenty here for everyone to enjoy a little bit of."
3,only for MAJOR moby fans,"I was expecting too much. I saw a sessions at west 54th performance of moby and thought - wow, here is my chance to get something with Moby live on it. The Live stuff here, while good, is nothing spectacular. another feature is essentially a bunch of songs playing with essentially a screen saver on your tv. I was not on NEARLY enough substances to make that seem cool. The Moby home video of his tour has its moments but is only really worth 1 or 2 viewings. Finally the videos -- some are outstanding, I have to say, while others are pretty lame. Probably the best moment on the disc are the outtakes from auditions for the ""bodyrock"" video. Id have to say I was expecting more gems like that. The gwen stephani duet is a notable absence here which, like my review, should indicate the disc is targeted to only the die-hards. Id suggest a rental first, even for them. It definitely has its moments though, just dont expect too much."
5,Wow... This DVD is Amazing,"I have never written a review before... it always seemed kind of like a waste of time. However, this DVD is wonderful. If you are considering purchasing it and you like Moby (especially live) I would highly recommend this DVD."
2,Are you all mad?!?,"This is the worst collection of videos that highlight exactly what a geek Moby is - nobody in these videos does anything, leaving the viewer wondering why they were made at all...The only good thing about it, and why I gave it 2 stars, is the remix section, which has some interesting visuals...don't waste your money on this ridiculous DVD!!"
3,Say What?,"The main problem for me was the extensive use of Yiddish and 1950s-era British slang -- there were just too many sentences where I didn't know or could only guess at what was being said. Also it's less about ping-pong than you might think from the blurbs. The assertion that it's ""one of the greatest sporting novels ever"" is mystifying. Still, it can be quite entertaining."
4,It's only partly about ping pong,"A coming of age story of a pathetically shy boy liberated by table tennis at the height of the depression. Peppered with Yiddish words, the translation of which is not always obvious.Not an auspicious premise, but oh what a read."
3,The Might Walzer,I gave this book three stars because I lost interest in some parts. I enjoyed the characters personal experiences and thoughts but often got bored during the excessive ping pong parts. HAHA.There were some hilarious parts to the book though and it often made me feel like I was reading a Philip Roth novel.
4,Walzer=Joke,"This book is an absolute joke. And by that I mean it is hilarious. The life of the Mighty Walzer is something that has to be read by everyone. I mean, this guy is an absolute joke. I was laughing aloud the entire book, I couldn't put it down. I am a huge ping pong fan, so the book really struck a chord with me, and it made me reminisce about the good ole' days playing pinger (as my father and I called ping-pong) with my dad.I am telling you, Howard Jacobson is an absolute genius. After reading this book I think Walzer should become a household name. What a joke!"
3,not quite,this book was not quite what I was looking for. it has very few routines and some not too clear. on the positive side the author has some good insight into the weight training process and principles.
4,Very good value for all who manage human resources,"I found this a valuable practical book and make use of it in my work. From my notes made at the time of reading it more than a year ago I recently developed the following, much of which comes from Mankin et al:A team is a group of people who agree: to pool and use their diverse skills and knowledge to accomplish mutual goals, to recognise the need to compromise in decision making, and to harness differences of opinion as a source of creativity rather than conflict."
3,hair metal tsol,"i heard this record was bad but i needed it to complete my tsol collection and went ahead and bought it. It came out in early 1990 and the only original member present is bassist Mike Roche(who subsequently quit tsol on the eve of ""Strange Love's"" release and the band got a replacement and toured for the album with no original members). There is only a trace of the band's punk past on this record and it is mostly 80s metal type stuff with guitar solos and whatnot. However for what it is, its not all that bad(the cover art alone is great), but dont buy this cd before hearing the 12"", ""dance with me,"" and ""change today."" For diehard tsol fans go ahead and get it and you might like some of it."
2,The cover sez it all...,What was left of TSOL had pretty much devolved into paint-by-the-numbers metal at this point. A couple of decent tracks in 'In the Wind' and 'Angel'. Bargin bin only for bizarro completists.
5,Finally.,"After way too long, this masterpiece is on CD. This record, UBU's first, has lost none of its power to shock and amaze. Often disturbing, the combination of hard-edged rock, David Thomas maniacal vocals, and weird sounds is unforgettable. ""The Real World"", ""Non-Alignment Pact"", ""Laughing"", ""Humor Me"", could be from the soundtrack of the great movie that David Lynch has never made. Listen and be changed.Now, if only geffen releases ""Dub Housing"" and ""New Picnic Time"" on single CDs, those of us who can't afford the boxed set (and have worn out the vinyl versions) can get these gems."
5,Up there with the best debut LPs...ever,"Just like the debuts by The Beatles, Velvet Underground and Roxy Music, this deservedly sits way up there..life altering!! True, David Thomas' vocals are challenging...and an acquired taste. True, the atmospherics can get rather bleak at times...and the synthesizer by Allen Ravenstine sounds like radiator steam hissing. Therein, however lay its charm. Fantastic stuff! Makes so many other bands' efforts pale in comparison. They have set the bar pretty damn high. Highest recommendation!"
3,"The songs that are good are fantastic, but much drags","The main issue I have with Pere Ubu is that they feel like Post-Punk Captain Beefheart at times, all the way down to the singing style. That aside, Non-Alignment Pact is a fantastic, driving, strong, emphatic song, leveraging what presumably are sampled factory whistles from Cleveland. Street Waves is an up-tempo rocky song, great solo, fits right in (with more factory whistles). Life Stinks is probably my favorite track on this. Funky, frenetic, great bass, great vocal solo. Most of the rest of the album clearly has important influence, especially notes of work Joy Division was about to do. However, I find it dragging and depressive without the impact it was searching for. Just comes across as whiny and even mopey at times. Personal taste and all that. I still recommend it, but I stick to the ""up"" songs for the most part because the less up songs rub me, personally, wrong. Hope this helps..."
1,WARNING!!!!! Rip Off!!!!,This same title as a duel disc can be had here on Amazon for 1/4 the price here so don't get suckered into buying this because it's the same thing and way cheaper. Review just reflects the major rip off.
5,An awesome new sound from an incredible band.,I first saw Citizen King open up for the Mighty Blue Kings and they were unlike anything I had ever heard before. I couldn't wait for their album to come out. They came to play another concert for FREE! This was after having their video on MTV. I really admire the band for being able to satisfy their fans without letting fame get to their heads. The CD is great and the band is now one of my very favorites. Definitely worth checking out if you've never heard them before.
5,One of the best records ever recorded,"This CD is in my top CD ever recorded every track is GOLD, no matter what your mood you put this on it is an instant party. I wish they were still together."
2,Nothing to write home to the folks about....,"This is not the most exciting album out there, nor the most enjoyable. Before I point out its flaws, I should point out that it's not a total waste... a few tracks are keepers. Under the Influence, Safety Pin, and Long Walk Home are all good... Better Days is ok until you've heard it for the gajillionth time, and The Milky Way is really keen but it's only 45 seconds long. The rest, unfortunately, blends together in one grey and uninspired blob. Basement Show, Smokescreen, Salt Bag Spill (what kind of title is THAT! ), and Billhilly are EXCEPTIONALLY bad. Adding to the disappointment factor of the bad songs on the album is the fact that the songs sound like a collection of Beck outtakes... it's really uncanny how much these guys rip Beck's style off. If you want weird (but good) music, I'd suggest you just buy Beck's Odelay, a far superior album to Mobile Estates. Steer clear of this one."
3,hometown support,"citizen king has really come a long way...from a milwaukee ""local"" band with great stage performance and catchy...bouncy tunes...ive been listening to their music for about 4 years now and i still beleive that ""brown bag lp"" was the best album...it is really neat to watch a band grow and know that you were there before everyone else was."
4,It's a jalopy style cd,"I just bought this cd thinking all the tracks would be like ""Better Days"" but they aren't at all. They're a lot more hard core than that, but the cd is still awesome. I love the song ""Long Walk Home"" and ""Jalopy Style"" but all the songs totally kick. definatley get this one if you're looking to hear a totally new sound in music."
2,"Citizen King ride the wave of ""Better Days"", and wipeout.","Citizen King briefly caught my eye back in 98 when I heard their radio hit, ""Better Days"". Hoping that this band had some more good vibes, I brought home Moblie Estates. The album is off and running with Under The Influence, and of course, Better Days. What follows is a disappointment. The next 4 tracks seem to be re-hashed remixes of the first two songs, and start off with energy, but soon fall flat. The album then hits a song that has promise, ""The Milky Way"" Unfortuantly, its cut at 45 secs, and is followed by the moronic Salt Bag Spill and Billhilly. In the end, in hopes of salavging the rest, we are treated to ""Checkout Line"" a song with good flow. The only problem is, we had to wade through nine songs to get there. In the end, I rather be ""Wastin' away in the checkout line/losin' time"" than losin' time listening to Moblie Estates."
5,The Greatest CD!,This is a great CD. It has good lyrics and good music. I would reccomend ths to anyone who likes music.
3,"Been there, done that","Fun, listenable, groovin' album, but you've heard all of this stuff before with other efforts from Beck, Sublime, et al. In fact, Better Days is pretty much a carbon-copy of every mainstream, played-out Sublime song you've ever heard. ""I've seen better days""? Indeed. The album has a good deal of variety, so you won't tire of it that quickly. It's not bad, but it's not outstanding, either. Try before you buy."
2,A one hit wonder band,"This has one good song ""Better Days"" the rest are just plain. I got this hoping for better songs but i ended up putting a better cd in my cd player. Only get this if you have money to spend."
4,Yeah,"Good album, nice scratches, catchy beats... It's not too deep, but fun and harmless.If you like this CD, I STRONGLY discourage buying their previous LP or EP. They're horrible. At least sample the tracks first. This is the primary reason I'm reviewing this album... to warn you nice people."
4,Beautiful legs,"These are outright sparkly and I love to wear them out and about. highly recommend them if you like that type of fashion. I give them an 8 out of 10 for comfort but be careful they like to run. If you are careful, there good for 2 or three wares. I happen to love the loke and feel, I give them four stars because the like to run."
1,Badly Written...,"What can I say about this book but that It was horribly written. Everything from the the writing itself to the hero that didn't believe the baby was his - even though he didn't take any precautions or a paternity test. I love reading about unrequited love from the heroine's POV and hard to get heroes, but only when the book is written well. This one wasn't. The heroine was like a love sick fool over a hero that didn't seem to want her and did everything to prove it to her. One minute he was declaring his love for her at 34 percent in, and then at about 37 percent he was kicking her to the curb and cheating out of nowhere. If I could sum this book up with one word, it would be depth-less. I've read a few books by Diana Palmer that was quite enjoyable but this one must have been one of her first ones because it screams amateur."
2,Dull trimmers,"This trimmers were as dull as the all in 1 andis clipper set I bought from wal-mart. The blase is the same as well. I wanted a trimmer for sharp line-ups like the barbes and I didn't get that. UNLESS, I'm missing something, these are not that sharp."
5,Great outliner!!,"This shaves and outlines much cleaner than my previous shaver, i'm glad I don't have to worry about the hair pulling and skin irritation of a dull shaver."
3,Good Clippers - not beard trimmer,"Amazing quality hair clippers, but no good for trimming your beard, as it comes with no accessories (clippers or combs) to trim beard...have to pay $15 more...."
1,bad investment,"I bought this trimmer to replace a cheap one because my wife started give my son and I our regular haircuts, I searched for the best T trimmer and was very disappointed with this product, it is very dull and hurts the skin. I wish I would have returned it."
4,pretty cool...,Not sure if this is the official one...But it works fine to me!!! For some reason I thought these went lower.
5,as described,The T-Outliner needs no introduction...most people I know have one or have had one. They last a good while it you take care of it. I use the andis clippers spray everytime I use it to keep it fresh and a duster to blow out any excess hair caught between the tight spots. Good product.
5,best ive ever used,"I just got these for christmas, ive been a hair stylist for about 7 years and these are hands down the best trimmers ive ever owned. I previously was using the Wahl peanut trimmers. The T-outliners are a little heavier so it took me a little while getting used to, but these get so close to the skin without kicking/cutting anyone. I would go as far to say that they get almost as close as a shaving razor. im in love with these and Andis has me as a customer from now on."
2,Outliner Trimmer,This is sooooo noisy....after the first use it just got loud and its vibrating harder than a truck engine under pressure.....And I have never dropped it....This is the first and last time I will be getting one of these...
1,Shuts off after 5 minutes and won't come back on for 1+ hour,"I don't shave very often and I bought these clippers to trim my beard before shaving. I can only get 50% of my face before the clippers stop working. I'm not sure if they're overheating or what. I've tried oiling the heck out of them, but nothing seems to matter. Very frustrating."
2,It's MOODY......,"This cutter cuts really good and it's like clean shaven but it's freaken' moody, plus you can't use it for a long time because it gets really hot that will burn your skin.I thought this brand is good,it's good in a way but come on, I said it's moody, because sometimes it cuts hair without any problem but most of the time my hair gets stuck in between the metal part.I bought the same brand for my dogs and I have the same issue, it overheats and dogs can't stand it.I had to always chase my dog because she would fight me, plus it makes so much noise for a dog.this is probably crappy review but, Im just not happy with my purchase.I hope I can return it but obviously I can't.Just but WAHL brand price is reasonable."
1,Poor Construction & Loud,"I have had this product for over 2 years now and decided to come back and review it. The blade is very very loud and get extremely hot when edging my beard and hair. The shell of the unit is made of plastic and the motor inside gets extremely hot to the touch. The 2 blades are separated by a thin plastic or cardboardish material that broke within the first 5 months of personal use. This causes the blades to not align very well at the point of the actual cut. Think of where the teeth from both sides of the blade meet. Since the material is so flimsy made, the teeth don't always align very well, and consequently don't cut a sharp line around the hair or beard line. This will be the last Andis I ever purchase. Poor construction, loud and hot."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this item six months ago and it worked well for five months and then it stopped working. Low power. I am disappointed considering this brand is considered one of the better quality out there. I would not recommend it. It does not last long and pricey.
2,Do not buy this item!!!!,"The box the trimmer was is was all messed up. When I opened them, they had hair and oil all over it, this product is 101% used. It say's ""New"", but really is not. The clippers is a rip off. They charge $48, just take and etra $25 and go get a BRAND NEW one with lifetime warranty. The trimmer cuts ok, but not like it should. I do not recommend this if you want to cut hair with a straight, crisp line. GO TO THE A BARBER STORE AND GET A BRAND NEW, MEAN BRAND NEW ONE FOR $60 WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY."
1,Amazon recommends purchase of combs which do not fit this trimmer,I bought this trimmer and the set of combs that Amazon recommends to go with them and the combs do not fit. Do not buy the suggested combs! They are made for a different model. See other comments on the combs page. We are very disappointed and now don't know if this clipper even has combs that go with it. The Andis site is not very helpful so far.
5,Top of the line!,This t outliner is the best outline machine i have owned so far really precise sharp no irritation really close shave real strong motor great for shape ups and children skin i have no complains what so ever honestly
3,Big difference from Outliner II,"I had the Outliner II for years, was nice and sharp and the trim felt clean as if I had used a shaver. I use a trimmer to shave because I get bumps from a regular shaver. But then it started giving me an uncomfortable trim, so I wanted to change the blades, then I see that there is the Outliner 4703 which is a higher number. So I get it. Wrong move, higher number does not mean better product. The trim is okay but not clean or close. I have tried adjusting the blades, aligning etc but I can't get the same feeling as the Outliner II. I still feel there is layer of hair not cut. Now I have to get another Outliner II since I threw my other one away...."
5,most common used clippers are baber shops,New as advertised and arrived quickly.. great set of clippers for a line up. my barber uses these so I looked on amazon as I was in the chair so i can have it for the road when traveling.
3,Fine as a trimmer.. don't expect good coverage or balding,"I was recommended these clippers by a friend who is a barber. He said he uses them daily for trim work, line work and doing light shaving/fades. He said they were good ""every day clippers"". Being a pro, I took his advice.While I can stay that they do good for what they were made for (lining/trimming), they are not good for what I was going to use them for.. cutting thick 1/4 to 1/2 inch hair to bald every 3-4 weeks. I typically like to run an electric all over, get me to that ""1-2 days of growth"" look and then hit it with a multi-blade razor to get that baby butt smooth. This one worked fine the first few strokes but it definitely showed it's weakness as I used it. Binds up quickly. Blades don't have the travel they need to be effective against thick hair.While it's good at what it does, don't expect it to perform miracles. I've since switched to a Wahl Balding Razor and it's night and day difference for how I use it."
4,Andis t-outliner,I liked that the product came before the due date. It comes with a little tube of oil for maintenance and the outliner. I bought it for my boyfriend and he said that he loves it! it really works well by cutting all the little fine hair and it leaves it smooth.
5,Great Trimmers!!!,The arrived in 4 days! They cut very well if you adjust them correctly. The trimmers do get hot after maybe 35 minutes of use. I only trim my hair so I take breaks to prevent them getting too hot or burned and it works. So you can either speed up the process or take breaks to let them cool off! Now my haircut looks like I go to the barbershop!!!
5,Great trimmers,These trimmer are the best I've ever owned. I use them for dry shaving because traditional razors irritate my skin. Dry shaving with these trimmers is comfortable and produces a very close shave. Motor runs smooth and quiet. Only down side is after about 30 minutes of use the trimmer gets moderately warm.
5,ANDIS PROFESSIONAL T OUTLINER TRIMMER 04710,"This is a very good hair line trimmer. Extremely sharp blades when purchased new , be careful. Excellent housing and casing, ergonomic hand grip. Quality as most ANDIS products are, again very satisfied. This trimmer seems very durable I dont believe i will have to purchase another for 10 years easy. Very Satisfied."
4,Good Facial edging and shaving,"I just used once since i got yesterday, its not that bad, i did a fast and quick shaving which came out looking good without any bleeding. and it was very close shave to a razor. it could have been made stronger.like other said, this machine heat up very fast, used it for few minutes and could sense its heating up, I dont think its a good idea for head shaving.i use Whale balding for my head and i will use Andis for Facial shaving.The Box came open and i saw small single hair on it, some reviewers stated that in their review below, I'm not sure if this was used or returned by someone then sent to me."
4,Good trimmer but...,"The trimmer is good, great cutting; it's solid and will last. The problem is the combs! Amazon, if you live in Canada, will shipped the trimmer but cant shipped the combs!! What's up with that! I had to call Andis to find the comb product number and finally manage to order them on another web site! There is only one type of comb that fits this trimmer. It's great for trimming the edge of your beard or hair but if you are planning to use this product for a clipper or beard trimmer look for the combs first!!!"
3,I almost forgot about this glad I finally got it,this shipping took seemingly forever this was one of my first orders but it just got to me I was going to use it this morning but something is wrong with it but I just have to loosen the blades and oil it thats all
3,Cut Ok For A Few Months,"This item started off strong. Seemed very quality like. After a few months use, boyfriend said it didn't cut as good as it use to when he first got it."
5,And is clippers,Great clippers love them. Always used Andes but these have been my favorite clippers by far. Wouldn't use a different brand. Great deal. Thanks again
4,Not bad,"The item still works to this day. It gets hot after 5 minutes of use, but stills performs a fine edge and cut. The price may have been too much considering the length of time the clipper can use continuously."
5,Excellent,"This is a excellent product, They shipped by the time that they said,excellent quality, i will definitely recommend this item!!!!"
1,45 seconds. Pitiful,opened the box and the clippers were nice. Plugged them in and they started off loud but I figured they just needed some adjusting. 45 seconds in they completely die. Couldnt even finish what I started.
3,Poor Quality,I AM SO DISSAPOINTED . My Outliners after 4 days are already breaking . When you turn it on its shakes morehan vibrates ! If anyone has any help on why this is happening please respond!
3,my boo loves it,"These clippers are great. They cut so close and without any pain or irritation. Normally clippers scrape my bf skin causing irritation and bumps. Without a doubt, i recommend this clippers and the brand ... buy it its worth it!"
3,So So Would not recomend for long use,"just got the trimmer today, i like the fading capability for my own personal use but on other heads it is a pain because there is no guard. One major factor I did not like was that after 5 minutes of use the buzzer gets extremely hot at one point i had to literally get a napkin to hold the buzze in my hand and had to be very careful not to touch the metal to my head. They definitley need to fix this. I would not return this just because the fading capability for personal use was very good and the fact i would have to go through all the balogni of returning it. But I would not buy again, I am in search of still a all around buzzer for fading and line ups. This Andis overal was so so, it is not good for sharp lines but good for personal fading. Not recomended if your going to use on someone else other then yourself."
5,Care's Review,The clippers are great to use. They are easy to handle and cut cleanly.The process on Amazon was quick and efficient. I will use Amazon again to purchase other merchandise.
3,Overheats too quickly,"I got this trmmer about 2 weeks ago. I started giving myself and my friends cuts, this trimmer is bad. It over heats when you use it for only 20 minutes you cannot even touch the blade because it is too hot. You have to wait about 30 minutes to cool it down. Also the trimmer cuts alot because of the heat the the adjustment of the blades. I would not recommend this. Go for the styliner 2 if your looking at mid range trimmers."
1,BROKEN TEETH !!!,"They shipped the item with broken teeth on the trimmers. I am currently in afghanistan and its not worth it to send the clippers back because of, time consumption and money being spent. This review is a little late but I just remembered to do the review after cutting myself with the clippers with BROKEN TEETH !!! Maybe you should try a different vendor as these guys might short change you."
1,Died on me within 2 months,"Worked great for the first month, then it wasn't cutting as close, and finally it stopped working all together...not happy at all with the quality...I thought this brand was good, but I guess not."
3,It does the job,The blade wasn't really sharpe and from time to time it stops working til I bang it on the counter.
1,i hate it,stop working after 5 week and i use the Trimmer twice im out of 47.00 dollars better luck next time
2,Had to return to manufacture.,"I had to return these Trimmers back to the Manufacture because the ones that I received overheated the very first time I used them, but they did change them out for me without any charge."
5,Best trimmers I have used yet!,"These bad boys work great! The trimmer head is much wider than the last few rechargable trimmers I have used so it trims much faster and it trims very close, much closer than my previous trimmers as well. The only thing I dont like is that it gets pretty hot after a few minutes of use. I use it to shave my face and the back of my neck, would highly recommend"
5,Andis Trimmers,"The Andis Trimmers are exactly what I needed. They are easy to use, the blades are sharp, and my 15 year old grandsons are able to use them without assistance. They give a sharp hairline with a professional look."
3,Works great but cant fit comb attachments,"My problem with it is that it doesn't fit any comb attachements with this blade. I had to buy another blade (ANDIS One Outliner II Blade Set (Model: 04604-GO)) in order to use the comb attachements. On top of that, there are only four comb attachments available through Andis for this model. That being said, it works really well and I am still relatively happy with my purchase (though it took a while and a lot of work...) This is a really nice trimmer. It works SO much better than the others I have had over the years. It cuts better, closer and is more quiet."
4,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,The trimmer is everything I expected. It gets close enough for my taste.The only con is that it gets really hot after a while.
4,Great,"I use it as a stubble trimmer. It's cuts very close, but doesn't shave. Perfect.It does vibrate a bit more violently than I would have thought. I'm no pro, so it may need adjusting. But it does vibrate more than my cheap $20 regular clippers.Great quality."
1,"great product, bad experience","ive had this item before and it works great, however this was my first time ordering it from amazon. when i received my package everything seemed normal, but when i plugged in the clippers i could tell right away that something was wrong. the clipper blades were moving way to fast and it sounded terribly loud. besides that one occassion ive actually owned these clippers twice before and those two times they were fantastic"
2,it's scary,i feel like i'm going to get cut when i use this product. it makes this noise and you have to be really careful and shave lightly.
